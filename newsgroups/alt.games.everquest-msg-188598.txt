If it ever gets to the point that I have to completely stop drinking colas 
without artificial sweeteners, then I will stop drinking colas completely.  
Artificial sweeteners are nasty, Nutrasweet even more so than Sacharine.  I 
will drink just about anything before I would touch a diet cola.  I am 
trying to lose excess weight, and therefor I drink water primarilly, and 
black coffee.
