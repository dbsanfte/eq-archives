It will make a big difference, though, if you want to download things while
playing.  I was downloading Linux distributions over Thanksgiving on my DSL,
from good download sights, so I was getting 187 KBytes/second, while playing
DAoC with no problem.  EQ and DAoC have similar bandwidth requirements, so
it would have worked well with EQ instead.

With a modem, or even ISDN, the game would have suffered.
