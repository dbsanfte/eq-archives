If you can't contradict my points, then try repeating your baseless

work for you.

Bards are a swiss army knife class.  They can do a number of functions,
depending on group composition.  Tanking is one of those functions... but
not the only one.

In most cases, my bard does more damage per minute with drum equipped doing
a triple twist of chants than he'll ever do using melee weapons.  This is in
part because he has a walrus skin drum and relatively crappy weapons...

You say they get AC for a reason.  Fact is, like clerics, bard AC starts out
strong and becomes a joke as they level up.  For some reason, all plate
classes are not equal; parry, riposte, dodge aside, same AC on a
warrior/SK/Paladin will do a lot more damage mitigation than it does on a
bard/cleric.  To me, this is a serious flaw in the EQ treatment of armor,
but its a fact.  This means that a bard as MA is significantly worse than a
real plate melee class MA.  Can it work?  Yes, you can have a ranger MA, a
cleric MA, a rogue MA... but does it work well?  No, not really.

Bard weapon choices also tend to be sub par.  The really good weaponry tends
to be limited to war/sk/pal/ranger, although its quite possible that I've
overlooked some nice bard choices.  My bard has deliberately concentrated on
the caster style role rather than going the melee bard route, I've not spent
a lot of time or plat looking for weaponry for him.  I know this, when I
group with my monk partner, the melee damage she lays out puts me to utter
shame, and would put me to shame even if I sang my much better self haste
instead of the group one that benefits us both equally.  At the same time,
when we are really getting beaten, she just goes FD and I kite the mob to
death, takes twice as long but the mob does die and neither of us does.
Then I sing her back to health and we are good to go again.

A bard in a group that concentrates on two songs instead of three is a fool
and a burden to his group.  Its quite possible, though, to twist three songs
and do nearly full weapon based damage output even if twisting in one that
requires an instrument.  For example, I frequently twist chains, haste, and
heal; heal requires a string instrument in hand, but I have one that works
in primary slot, so I can drop it in for the one second in 18 that I need it
there, and only rarely miss a swing.

Its the bards job to decide where he's most useful.  If thats doing nothing
but provide support songs, then it is.  Watch what he's singing and ask
questions in tells if you like, you may get an education.  Or the bard in
question may be a fool.  Its hard to tell.  But qroup composition, strategy,
bard song list, bard equipment, and bard's personal play style all play a
role here.  Bards can be pure casters, pure melee, or a mix of both, and
switch roles easier than you can log out to get a different toon.  Most
people have little idea of what a bard can do, and those who do often
suffer, as you seem to, from ONE version of what this is; you seem to want
bards to be rangers.  Thats one possibility, maximize melee output and have
at... but its far from the only choice, in fact one of the most popular
views as to the bard function is mana whore, sit amongst the casters and
pour on the mana non stop.  Put that bard among the melee and you have
casters sitting too close to the fight, or missing out on the song.

Crowd control bards find melee output particularly tricky to sustain, as its
easy to end up breaking your own mezes; a CC bard is busier than a one
legged dwarf at an ass kicking contest anyway, and its safer for him to
double or triple mez the target if there's only one, rather than count on
one pulse per 18 seconds and hoping it sticks.

Charm pet bards can melee, but this puts them right next to their former pet
when charm breaks; better for them to stand well back and pour on the DOTs
till charm breaks, so they can switch to former pet and reapply charm before
they get beat on.

Fear kite bards... well I've never seen one that isn't meleeing at the same
time, despite the risk of a mild beating when fear breaks.  Important to be
up close for the snare breaks, you see, and anyway the fear is short range
AE, so you Can't do this at a distance.

Often, yes, thats all its for... in fact, worse than that, its occupying
space that should be taken up by instruments  Other times, sure, bard
weaponry can do an appreciable job, particularly when the targets are lower
level and the melee present isn't heavily loaded in favor of ultra-high
DPS...

Put bard epic in my hands, or some of those new weapons that also emulate
instruments, and you'll see more melee output from me.  Swapping multiple
sorts of instruments in and out, on the other hand, is trouble enough, doing
so in addition to swapping weapons in and out is... well I'm willing to
work, thats a bards lot in life, but I'm not necessarily willing to work
THAT hard.   You have to expect a little laziness from a class that demands,
at a minimum, a click every six seconds for the entire length of a play
session... often as much as twice that during active combat.
