Erm, Ronnie babes... or should I say; Ronnie Boyo look-you...
I asked you to provide your full name, address and phonenumber. You
didn't then and you aren't now. 

Liar liar pants on fire.

>What a moron.

Feel free to randomly replace "moron" with any of the following in
your future posts; idiot, imbecile, cretin, changeling, bizbee,
half-wit, retard.
