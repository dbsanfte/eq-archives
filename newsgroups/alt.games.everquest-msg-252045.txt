I didn't say it wasn't possible, I said I didn't do it.

My warrior duoed with a friend, with occasional groups, until the low 50's.
After that it was large groups, since my partner had quit, and my warrior
was unable to effectively solo anything blue.

Similarly, my rogue was played in twink groups to the mid 40's, at which
point she was unable to effectively solo.

attempts")

Which is pretty irrelevant, since it wasn't in when I was passing those
levels.

Anyone ever tell you that you have quite a talent for sucking the fun out of
everything? : )



(1) I'd also have to question how well your warrior solos.  It seems from
watching your .sig as if he's gained about three levels in the last two
years.  I'd guess its either not as fun or not as effective as you're making
it out to be.
