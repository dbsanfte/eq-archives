>Wow, do I need some hand-holding.

Just found this thread on Allakhazam...

"Since this seems a bit unclear, I will give some tactics.  First, realize that the MB is
the most difficult of the tier one bossess to kill. This engagement is by no means an easy
one...though this is usually due to the fact that after the MB is killed, things can often
go sour with too many seeking there flag or being concerned about the loot. 
The Manaetic Behemoth (MB)is located in a room with 2 doors. This room is surrounded by
one huge square passage. In each of the corners of this passage (the corners of the square
passage around the MB's room) is where you need to set up a group to contain the spiders.
In other words, you need FOUR containment groups to hold back the spiders from entering
the MB's room and exploding. It is HIGHLY suggested to have as many enchanters as possible
for this raid, having at least one in each corner. 
Prior to having the groups set up in each corner...NO ONE is to engage a spider. Just
leave the bloody things alone. In pick up raids, it is inevitable that someone will attack
one for some odd reason, do NOT heal that person or assist that person...just rez. Just
outside of the four corners are big tubes in the floor with light streaming out of it.
This is where spiders pour out of. The waves start of small, but begin to quicken with
more spiders as you go. Just hit with snares as they leave the holes and proceed towards
your corner. Chanters mez extra spiders if possible. Kill them, rinse and repeat...for 10
minutes. 
During this ten minutes, you will have people asking what the hell is going on because no
matter what, many will not of listened to the pre-instructions about the ten minutes. Spam
that it takes ten minutes of containing spiders prior to MB being targetable. Once MB is
targetable, kill the bloody thing...not so easy, and some nasty surprises in killing him
such as silence. During his engagement, each corner must keep containing the spiders. IF
any get through they will wipe the raid force on MB, and thus no flag. 
Once MB is down, it is HIGHLY important that your corners know that they are too keep
containing the spider. Send the MB force out to the corners to shore them up and do any
rezzes needed. As soon as containment is assured, have each corner peel off a certain
number to go back and hail the gnomer for the flag and go right back to the corner. If
strict control is not kept during this stage, you will die, you will lose the flag mob,you
will hear lots of moaning and crying over the raid being all screwed up and blaming it on
whoever led even though its some stupid players that leave their corners fault."

To this I will add that the raid begins with a fight through POI to the factory floor,
where each raid member hails Giwin Mirakon for a character flag.  After MB is downed, a
Gnome pops (at MB's corpse...?), hail this guy for the Tactics flag.  Back in PoK, hail
Seer Mal Nae`Shi, sit in front of her, and /say "Unlock my memories" repeatedly until you
recieve your flag AA.

Am I missing anything?

Thanks a bunch!
