Hard to say, but I know just a few levels makes a big difference on whether
or not I can stick a spell on a mob.  So if it allowed me to cast as if I
were higher level, it would be similar in quality to a Tash, but allow me to
use it on multiple mobs.  If this is what it does, it certainly bears
further investigation.
