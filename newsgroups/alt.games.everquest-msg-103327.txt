Interesting, reminds me a little of the Primordial Malice stuff (I
wish that faction was fleshed out too).

Halflings and Wood Elves use religion to establish their orders; leave
it to the humans to make druidness a political thing :) (This probably
explains why they're so uptight on the animal issue - it's not only
for the sake of taking care of animals, but protecting them is one of
the Big Issues for both sides :) )
