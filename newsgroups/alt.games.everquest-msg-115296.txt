That makes about as much sense as a chocolate hammer.  

Speaking as a druid, it gets damned tiresome getting tells from people
all the damned time asking for SoW/Buffs/Ports, regardless of how
politely they are worded.  It's invasive.  Exactly as annoying as
telemarketers.  It's not exactly rude, but it sure the hell ain't
polite, no matter how it's worded.
