When talking time running the quest, one generally counts time in
acquiring the nuts, too, even if they had been gathered before running
the rest of the quest.

And there's absolutely nothing dangerous about giving the regurgitonic

gives GOOD barbarian faction hits. I tended to go that route with my
old DE enchanter for that very reason.
