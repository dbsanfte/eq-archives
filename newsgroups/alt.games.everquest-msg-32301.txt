Y'know.. I once trolled the Napster chat rooms *eg*  This would be back 
when there were rumors flying about Napster being shut down by the music 
companies but nobody *really* knew anything.  Nevermind the fact that 
there was still IRC, FTPs, etc to get MP3s from.  These 14 year olds were 
up in arms and ready to go to war for Napster.  So I walked in and 
started discussing how the music company had a right to protect what was 
theirs, and if they didn't like it, they were free to create their own 
music and give it away.  I also, to be nice, pointed out other ways of 
getting the music without paying.

Wait, the fun part is coming.  Within two seconds I got a reply stating 
that I was a "communist capitalist slave of the record industry".

More fun was had by all (or me, I guess).  Dang, I wish one could log 
Napster chat...
