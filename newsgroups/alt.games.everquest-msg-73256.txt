  Maybe, more memory certainly can't hurt (well, unless maybe you're
talking 512+ mb with Win98).  According to the EQ web site though, the
RAM minimums haven't really changed since the implementation of DX8
for original EQ.  I have 256 mb so maybe I'm cushioned against the
effects, but I get okay performance as long as I'm using the old DLL
(performance equal to my pre-DX8 performance).

  Certainly lots of memory is necessary if you have Luclin, but if
not, I bet 128 mb will serve you just fine.
