    No, it's poorly designed. Making up points costs at every raid can lead
to charges of bias. "How come he paid 1 point for the same item I had to pay
10 points for? I want my nine points back!!" You have to know before stuff
drops (if possible, obviously can't do this with new content) what it'll
cost.

    Odds are you'll have more than 30 people, though. Our last Cursed raid
we had something like 70 people including recruits. Not because we needed
the people - all the monks, rogues, paladins, etc. were using bows and
clocking oh-so-powerful 7.5 DPS - but because everyone wanted to be a part
of it and have a chance at the loot. The 30 people is what you think you'll
require to get a kill.

    I like the idea of bidding to prevent rots, but in practice it can be
horribly abused. Example: the monks in your guild form an alliance. They
decide beforehand who will get monk only loot, if it drops. Then, they agree
that nobody but the person who is "due" will bid on that loot. So the monks
get all their class-specific items for the minimum bid value, allowing them
to get more all/all items (which usually are high-quality items for monks).
This really hoses the INT casters, since usually items are tagged
MAG/WIZ/ENC/NEC - no alliances possible there.

    Quote from your original post: "I'm less and less eager to go on
raid after raid when I know that I'm not getting anything
no matter what drops." So how do you motivate yourself to go to Kael Arena
after getting all the Thurg plate you want, or back to HoT after you've
completed your Skyshrine? Raid after raid, no chance at a drop because you
have it already. My guild makes jokes about it, but we see it happen at our
level. I don't make any special effort to get home early for a Burrower
fight because there's nothing off the Burrower I want. Other clerics trip
all over each other to get to Burrower, but are strangely absent when it's
time to do Shei because anything he drops that a cleric could use will go to
a hybrid or shaman. And so forth. We have *100* people with Emperor Keys,
but our last attempt there were 60 people there because he's not a "solved"
mob.

    Once your guild is geared up, you can move on to the next challenge - a
challenge you couldn't overcome without the gear from the previous
encounter. There's content out there you'll never see if you don't either
jump to a higher-level guild, or help the guild you're in prepare itself.
The question you have to ask is this: is seeing that content worth the
grind? We've had a fair number of people leave recently because the answer
for them was "no", so it isn't cut-and-dried.

    Trust me - XP when getting the insignias is marginal. On second floor,
where you'll frequently have two groups pulling one area, we have people
assist their group tank and offtank frequently so XP is shared. But on most
raids we're too busy worrying about doing our jobs well to complain much
about XP.

    They do it in the officer channel - it isn't a lone person's call. We've
had some decisions, like the one Shield of Ssraeszra (or something like
that), take 29 of the 30 minutes on the corpse timer before being called. I
only feel for them when a wide variety of classes can use an item. Usually
you know who's due in a given class.

    That's when the whining starts from Mr.-Always-Plays. "You need me to be
successful, I feel like I have no control over what I get, why isn't my
contribution recognized, yadda yadda yadda."

> Be happy for him, hope you beat him next time.  At least it was fair

    Fair how, exactly? Should a person that plays once a week have the same
one in four chance at the best loot your guild has ever seen as the three
warriors that ate countless deaths to get you to that stage? Look at it from
a risk vs. reward standpoint - the three warriors eat all the risk when
you're learning the encounter, then the fourth warrior parachutes in when
loot is due to scoop the reward? That's fair? And that is exactly what the
powergamers will say.

    Really, how can an officer in a random roll guild solve it without
/guildremove? "I have a hectic work schedule, I have a full social calendar,
I have a million and one reasons that you as an officer can't verify." And
it's not like you can change the rules of the /random just when Mr. Sunshine
is on - that's bias! You're being unfair to Mr. Sunshine, whose only crime
is being busy/popular/good at covering up what alts he plays on non-loot
days!

    It could be that you don't notice it because your raids are spontaneous.
Ours are planned well in advance, because we need to signal the other top
guilds of our intentions beforehand to avoid incidents. So our people know
well in advance if they'll be washing their hair that night.

    Try killing the Avatar of War when your main tanks are sitting at 6000
HPs buffed, or your casters are missing key spells. It just doesn't happen.

    Actually, that would be the opposite of my approach. Get the best stuff
you can, and once nobody needs that stuff, move on. Right now I have silver
pants, boots, and gloves, blood-red bracers, black chain arms and a lavender
BP (no helm visible). I'm not exactly the queen of fashion - but my gear is
pretty efficient, given what I've had access to.

    Well, no, but you can do OK anyways. ;-)

    If he's with another A, he'll always be playing with someone with good
gear that can get things done. If he's playing with a series of B's, well,
the B's just can't cut it as the guild progresses. And that's IF the guild
progresses, instead of farming the same thing for months because it takes so
long to get the casual players geared up.

    That's a question for the guild leadership. It could very well be that
they want to take the guild in a particular direction that many of the
people in guild wouldn't like. If that is the case, vote with your feet on
the new policies. We've had people leave the guild to start low-key guilds
of friends that only get together every so often to have fun, and it's
always been amicable. In general, I find that when people leave a guild if
they drop in station the old guild is happy, but if they go up in station
(join the local uberguild etc.) they get angry. ;-)
