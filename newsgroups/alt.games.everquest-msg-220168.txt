LoIO was an anomaly - it was originally considered a newbie zone, and
newbie zones had (have) high ZEMs.  Because it also provided a place for
teen's and 20's to fight with that ZEM people flocked to it (from the 
previous spot SK).

The ZEMs on Paludal, Befallen and the like reflect the effort that SOE
made a while back to encourage dungeon grouping at lower levels.  At this
time they extended the cleric/paladin rez line, they gave druids/wizards
low level succor, necros low level summonc corpse, and they boosted the
ZEM on under 30 dungeons.  I think they are much too high compared to other
places available at that level.  In addition, Paludal is one zone off a
city and extradordinarily easy to get to.
