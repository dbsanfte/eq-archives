Loral's Evil Agenda, September 2005

by Loral on September 24, 2005

With the announcement of SOE's latest Everquest Community Summit it was
time once again to sit back and ponder the best possible future
direction for Everquest. Previous evil agenda covered everything from
encounter variety to mentor systems and many of these items are now
addressed. With the latest expansion released only two weeks ago, it
becomes difficult to say for sure where the future should head.

We begin this Evil Agenda start with four larger areas for improvement
and then include a list of a few smaller areas or areas already
discussed previously (often at great length). Let us begin.
1. Further Improve Monster Missions.

Monster missions added a whole new gamestyle to this six year old game
and it has become a favored style of play for many since its release.
Add 18 and 24 person monster raids to give any group of 18 to 24
players a chance to try out the raid style so popular with many higher
level players. Offer missions for groups with three players. Continue
to use monster missions as a way to experience lore by tying them to
old moments in Norrath history.
2. Continue to Tie Future Expansions to Old World Lore.

Many nostalgic players talk about the great days of Kunark and Velious.
By making these two older expansions part of the core base of the game,
SOE can then base instanced dungeons, monster missions, and even entire
expansions off of these older lands. Many players now off in other
lands may return if they see "Everquest: Ruins of Kunark II" on the
shelf.
3. Improve the Dynamics of Combat.

New AAs like Gift of Mana show a new style of combat where random
elements can change player behavior during combat. This leads to new
and unique battles instead of typical "Step 1: complete heal, step 2:
see step 1". Consider the heroic opportunities from EQ2. Work on
encounters that increase difficulty without simply upping the
creature's damage.
4. Improve the 20 to 50 Game.

These past six months we have seen a new tutorial, new 10 to 20
missions, and two rebuilt newbie zones. New 20 to 50 missions and tasks
will help players grow from these new additions to the later content
found in Omens of War, Dragons of Norrath, and Depths of Darkhollow.
New mid-level missions, more quests, new armor quests, or even an
"epic-lite" quest would greatly improve the 20 to 50 game.

With those four major Evil Agenda points behind us, lets look at a few
additional changes that would continue to improve the game:

    * Continue to tune spirit shrouds to ensure usefulness above level
55.

    * Find solutions to the limitations of the global model file.

    * Rebuild Plane of Knowledge to reduce lag, add features, and
improve cultural bonding (like "Halastown").

    * Add an sound effect as an option when receiving a tell.

    * Find a way to make new player models a possibility.

    * Add a separate con color for mobs within five levels of the
player.

    * Improve the point-rewards for LDON gear from 20 to 65 to make
LDON viable for gear progression again.

    * Make "/" work for cross server and cross game tells instead of
";" and "[".

    * Further consolidate and simplify the user interface. Combine like
windows.

I look forward to the future of Everquest.
