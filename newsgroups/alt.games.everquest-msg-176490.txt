Well, GM Nystramo seemed unsure actually in that post, he qualified his
description of how it works with "I believe".  Given the scenarios presented
by him, it is easily explainable by the description that Sony gives in one
of your links as to how it occurs.  Taunt is less effective on higher level
mobs, so, it fails more frequently, so, in order to get a successful taunt,
you would need to taunt more times.  This would explain the apparent
behavior just as easily as saying that taunt adds to the aggro every time.

Your second cite says nothing about how taunt works, just that it is a
useful ability for keeping other party members alive.

And, http://tinyurl.com/4r1y appears to directly contradict you, it says:
"When you successfully taunt a monster, it turns and starts attacking you
instead."
Sounds pretty conclusive to me.

Your last cite, at a quick glance, searching for "taunt", said nothing at
all about how taunt skill does or does not work.

So, care to elaborate on how any of this shows that your theory of how taunt
works is correct?  The closest is that one GMs belief of how it works, which
directly contradicts what Sony says on how it actually works, at least when
I read it.
