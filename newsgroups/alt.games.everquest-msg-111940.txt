OK, so on a server that has lists, there is constant contention.  On a 
server that doesn't have lists (Innoruuk) there is very rarely contention.  
Both servers have a backlog of clerics.  I'm not sure that lists really 
make life easier.
I preferred Ragefire in Sol B.  It was a camp, and was generally 
respected.  If you did the time, and kept the Firegiants clear, you pretty 
much were given time to collect your forces and spawn the dragon.  The 
only issue came when someone would try to claim the camp with a feigned 
monk and a camped out cleric.  
It also seemed to lead to more public Naggy raids.  I know that every time 
we had a cleric needing an epic, we would just wait until Naggy popped, 
then gather all the 45-52s we could find, buff the hell out of them as we 
were clearing the FGs, and then throw them at Naggy.  We tried twink 
raids, but it was tough to have enough twinks at the appropriate level.  
People got a chance to kill Naggy in a well-run raid, we got to move into 
the lair and set up camp for a couple days.
