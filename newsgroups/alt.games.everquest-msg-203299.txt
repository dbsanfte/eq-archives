<<<<<<<<He's obviouly never been in a group in someplace like CoM with a wizard
who's spent 90%+ of their playing time soloing with KEI.   He's never
watched as said wizard just starts nuking once the pull is made (because
that's what they've always done ... no worries with KEI, I've got tons of
mana).  He's never seen "<Wizard> begins to cast a spell" scroll across his
screen and gone, "Oh, shit".

Because, friends, the wizard's about to learn a lesson he/she should've
learned at a derv camp in Nro as a teenager.  It's not about mana at that
point ... it's about aggro.

When you solo your life away at lower levels with KEI, you have aggro all
the time.  'Aggro Management' becomes aggroing the mob and killing it before
it breaks root.  But when you get in a group against large mobs that you
have no possibility of soloing, you don't know what to do, so you do what
you've always done ... nuke it as soon as you see it.  And then all hell
breaks loose.

The wizard gets aggro from the MT.  The healer burns mana trying to keep the
wizard alive, which is, at best, like trying to hold the ocean back with a
broom.  The wizard then dies in the back of the group, and the reaver aggros
the next player in line (quite probably the healer), and the healer goes
down.  And, if the healer happened to be a druid, your group has now lost
both evac possibilities.

Total wipeout follows.

And that, Pulp, is where skill comes in.  It takes skill to be able to
interact with 5+ other people, be it in a boardroom or a game.  And it takes
skill with this game software to learn the role of your chosen class in a
group/raid setting and, for example, not acquire aggro from those in the
group who are supposed to have it.  You may believe otherwise, but it does.
Perhaps you'll believe that when you come across someone in-game with no
skill, as we all have.

You learn those skills in your teens and 20's .. not in your 40's and 50's.
By the time you hit those levels, those skills should be refined.

With KEI available in the teens and 20's, there's no need to group, so those
skills aren't acquired.

Crash>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I'll never stop being amazed by the over inflated opinion of yourselves you
guys have.  You just wasted a ton of time typing about a wizard who over nuked
and grabbed too much aggro.  Sheesh, it takes a whole lot to teach someone the
"skill" of that.  Please.  That's laughable.  You've got to be kidding.  My 10
year old nephew has that kind of "skill".  He learned it after a short time of
playing and he's never seen a boardroom.  Cmon, it's just a game and you're
kidding yourself.
