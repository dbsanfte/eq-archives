I have heard of 'naked greed' being used to describe the robber
barons of 1800s U.S.  I knew a guy in the USN who was greedy for sex
every seaport we went to. He also spent alot of time being medicated
for the diseases he caught. Of course, as the Corpsman explained to
him, using protection would have prevented hom from catching
everything he caught, with the exception of the crabs.
