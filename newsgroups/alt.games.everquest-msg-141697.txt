    I believe it's on the order of ten minutes. Hopefully, nobody here will
ever confirm this in person.

    Yes. In general, if a mob depops when not aggro for X minutes then you
can kite it around to keep it up. One of the other guilds on our server
actually did this to Vyzh'dra the Cursed in the basement of Ssra when they
nearly wiped the first time - they sent down person after person to kite it
until they were killed so the main force could res in, buff up, and try
again. They actually killed it on the second attempt, too!

    Yup. The issues arrive when someone from their force survives and starts
kiting Ragefire around, and the time goes past the "open chance" time. Does
your force respect someone that's kiting Ragefire, with no chance of killing
him, while the sitting cleric tries to gather sufficient force? On my
server, before our list, that's when the biggest fights would arise. And
different GMs giving conflicting answers on whether a kited mob is "engaged"
didn't help matters.
