Rune 1 & 2 are pretty useless

Rune 3 uses Jaspers about 1 pp ea.  

Rune 4 uses Peridots as well, but most enchanters use rune 3 until (or
even after) they have rune 5 due to the huge jump in cost vs only a few
hp more.

Good point, i'm sure not making enough cash to aford to do this in
groups though at 55, besides shaman slow better - one of the many
reasons I prefer to group with a shaman.

Enchanters also have a componentless "rune" type spell int the berzerker
series, however it doesn't stack with most Str buffs, it doesn't last
very long, the mana/hp ratio is very bad, it's not as many hp as rune -
but it does stack with rune.

Enchanter animations all use tiny daggers I think 1-4 at a time
depending on spell, they are fairly cheap running about 1 gp ea IIRC.
