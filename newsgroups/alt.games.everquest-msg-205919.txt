Hi,

Being in the UK and about 4 years behind the rest of the world, I just
bought Everquest and have a few questions if anyone can be bothered...

1) Is it still worth it? Are there enough other people still playing that
are of a low enough level to be interested in grouping with a new character.

2) I have plenty of time to play, but not at set times so grouping is a
problem except in an ad-hoc type fashion. Everyone says that Mages/Necros
are the best for solo?

3) If I persist with EQ, will it give me a good grounding for EQ2 in
December when it all kicks off again?

4) I hear loads of talk on quading, kiting, twinking, blinging etc, etc. It
all sounds extremely complicated for a casual gamer?

5) Is the server list I see (EQ Gold, UK) only populated with Europeans, or
are the servers world-wide?

6) I have all the expansion packs, but no idea how to use them?

7) Is the only way to work out the best areas for class/race combos just
casual experimentation and is it true that as a solo, there are places I
just can't go?

8) In a group, when you get killed, is there any easy way to find your way
back to them?

9) I have seen all kinds of maps on the interweb for individual places, but
no indication as to how they all go together, ie Halas leads to Everfrost
etc?

10) I'm playing on the Newbie server? Is there anything wrong with staying
there, or should I head for a different one?

11) Is magic and spell casting complex?

12) Are there any UK guilds / groups worth joining as a casual.

Sorry if this post is the questioning of a simpleton considering I'm about
four years behind everyone..

Thanks
