You are confusing Melee with Tank.

On any given mob you should have one tank.  His job is to stand in front 
of the mob and take a beating.  His damage output is, in many cases, 
almost irrelevant; his job is to take the beating and keep the mob's 
attention.  Instead of Tank (which is the popular term I admit) I prefer 
to refer to this as the Sponge.

Then there's other melee in the group.  Their job is to avoid getting 
hit (because healing several people is usually less efficient than 
healing one person), and to do melee damage.

In front of the mob, you end up getting hit from ripostes.

But worse, the mob ends up avoiding some of your hits, by block, dodge, 
parry, and that same riposte.

A rough estimate often bandied about is that attacking from the front of 
a mob costs you about 15% of your DPS.  Being Sponge costs you even more 
DPS because you end up spending some of your time stunned, unless you 
are an Ogre.

Thus, even if the second tank is a warrior in exactly the same 
gear/level/buff status, he should still attack from the rear, the 
equivalent of getting a 15% haste!

Most melee you'll play with on a casual basis fail to understand this, 
and end up attacking from either any angle at random, or worse, 
deliberately manuevering into the front of all mobs they fight.

There are circumstances where this is a good idea; where you have to 
worry about push moving a mob into a bad position, for example, or when 
you are trying to keep casters out of AE range on certain large mobs, or 
when you are trying to keep rogues in the back arc: the latter two are 
only really an issue if the MT keeps losing aggro to you, or if there's 
a good chance he's going to die and you'll be next on the list.

I wouldn't ignore people for failing to get this idea, though, heck, I 
work with people to train them on assisting so as not to break mez, a 
far worse crime, convincing them there's a way to get a 15% boost to 
their DPS usually isn't all that hard.
