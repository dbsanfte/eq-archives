>>Your standing with Clurg just got better.

Anytime you see "just got better", that means your faction was raised with
that group.

>> Your standing with the Greenbloods just got worse. <<

Anytime you see "just got worse", that means your faction was lowered with
that group.

IIRC, the Greenbloods are the Ogre SK guild. There should be an NPC in the
SK guild that you can turn meat and tails in to, which will raise your
Greenblood faction. Unfortunately, it will lower your Craknek Warrior
faction.

Since you are a warrior, I would think the Craknek faction is more important
that the Greenblood faction.
