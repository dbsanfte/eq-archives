Can be done with 3 groups (or less) of 65s.  Might be a little optimistic,
but the mobs until the final ones aren't really all that hard.

It's 4 spots.  It helps considerably to know that.

Nope.  You don't lose 8th ring if you fail on 9th.  I know from personal
experience.  The downside of only having 3 groups is that sometimes you have
more giants running at Thurgadin than you have people available to stop
them.  =)

My how times have changed.  I've "always" been in a raiding guild, and
that's better than I had when I first hit 60.  =)
