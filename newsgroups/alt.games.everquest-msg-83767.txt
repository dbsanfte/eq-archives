I think you'll find the cliche you are actually looking for there is "It's
JUST a game".

You realise I have to now ask what you mean by "real worth". I value my
account; therefore it has real worth. No?

Except that if someone who has trusted access to RL items causes them to be
damaged, or lost, RL measures can be taken. For example if your room-mate
trashes your car, it's not unreasonable to expect him to pay for it; and
presumably he could be forced to do so. However, if damage is done to one's
EQ account, there is no recourse available.
