Running a fine line here, using guards or mob aggro critters to "save" you 
has always been an accepted practice, however, using a non-aggro npc to do 
your fighting for you, probably against targets you would otherwise be 
unable to challange normally is seriously frowned upon. Although no direct 
action may be taken against you by a GM, you will probably find that either 
the hate list or combat ability of the guard you are using will be modified 
to prevent a questionable "exploit".

The last example of this I saw, was the change in aggro status of the guard 
near Shadowhaven zone line in the upper level Echo side. She was regularly 
used to drag Fireclaw down to where she was able to take it down to about 
20% health before getting herself killed. Last few times I've seen people 
try this, she has ignored the big beetle leaving the player scuttling to 
zone line themselves.

Please consider other people and their future need of protection that you 
may alter for the sake of a few days xp.

As a side note, get thee some sow potions and go kite in EW, lots of space 
to run around, virtually empty zone and still decent xp depending on what 
you're hunting all the way up to middle 40's
