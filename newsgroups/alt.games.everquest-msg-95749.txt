Well, hunt for exp at the lower parts of the Aviak village in SK. Loot gems 
(and do not sell them if you have the slots to hold them) and loot bronze 
or FS weapons. You can sell these to Krak behind the penthouse on the top 
level by standing behind him, hitting Sneak, and right clicking him. Use 
the coppers and silvers to buy bandages (as soloing here is what you want 
to do)  You will get a  few hundred plat per level, which can buy you some 
decent gear if you are shrewd.
