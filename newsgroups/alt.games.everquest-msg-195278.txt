I'm sure I did.  Was no actual halfling in the party if you read
carefully.  Dwarf cleric should be at baseline, and Iksar Shaman at
20% penalty.

Since the little lady and I dinged 11 at the same point, and she
dinged 12 when I hit 4 yellow, thats precisely the 20% penalty that
previous studies suggest.

If she'd been a halfling warrior, I'd have expected her to be 30%
ahead instead of 20%.

Forssake, 15 Iksar Shaman, cooling my heels in KC (Jarcrap helm so
far)
