No... To make use of for one's own advantage.  "He tried to gain advantage"
is what I said.  He used a know "feature" in being able to turn in Woe and
Envy several times to get a quest gem to increase faction.  That is the
exploit.  Not doing a single quest multiple times to gain faction (as in
bone chip turn-ins, muffins for that paladin in Freeport, etc.).  He turned
in the same items (which are returned) to get a gem to turn in for
additional faction.  Therein lies the exploitation of the system and
exploiting the "feature" for his own advantage.  I don't have an issue with
Pirg doing just that.  The walkthroughs tend to tell you when to do just
that.  I will say again, I think that he should (and did) get his spear as
he did not try to skip anything or go around the qeust (he was just
attempting to minimize the chance that faction would be too low, not
realizing that too high could be an issue).  I also think that the final
turn-in should have been returned rather than eaten, with a message stating
why the quest was not completed.
