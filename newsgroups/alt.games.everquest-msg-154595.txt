Actually, the vast majority of regular posters to the
alt.religion.scientology newsgroup are CRITICS of Scientology!  There
will be occasional Scientologists who will try to "handle" the
newsgroup by posting anti-psychiatry posts (Scientologists are
strongly opposed to psychiatry) or criticizing other Scientology
critics, and some Scn higher ups do read the newsgroup (probably to
threaten to sue people who post any of their high-level secret
teachings to the newsgroup), but like I said, most of the regular
posters are ANTI-Scientology, either ex-members or people who are
opposed to Scientology's attacks on free speech, harassment of
critics, their bait-and-switch scamming, etc.  (it does tend to be
pretty noisy, though, with critics arguing with each other, etc.)

By the way, a few good web sites (anti-Scientology) are:

http://www.xenu.net
http://www.lisamcpherson.org (and also http://www.lisamcpherson.com
)--Lisa McPherson was a Scientologist who died at the age of 36 after
being kept in isolation by Scientologists for 17 days at their
headquarters in Clearwater, FL)
http://www.altreligionscientology.org/ (links to a number of critics'
pages)
http://home.snafu.de/tilman/
http://www.ronthewarhero.org

(those are just a few that I could think of at the top of my head,
there are plenty of other good sites you can check out from the
http://www.altreligionscientology.org page)
