I'm curious how many of you use the Premium Magelo, Allakazham, or
both?

I ask this because I had been using Magelo (non Premium) to keep a
quick refrence of my characters...But I had to input the information
manually.
I use the Premium service of Allakazham to do Quest, Equipment, MoB,
and Faction research.  In the past some equipment data could be
sketchy in accuracy.
Well Since Alla has purchased Lucy, the equipment and spell data has
become very up to date and accurate.   They also have a tool that does
the same as Magelo that uploads information about your character
(Stats, PP, Gear, Spells, AA, Skills) for easy quick refrence. This
tool can also do a local dump to an HTML file for quick easy refrence
where each piece of gear has a URL going to the LUCY site.  They also
provide the ability to link your character profile so others can take
a look see.  The only big difference between the two is the layout of
the information.

Now, what I wonder is why anyone would use Magelo rather than Alla,
when Alla brings so much more to the table.  Or, why anyone would pay
for both?

What's your viewpoint, thoughts, insight?
