The worst ones are the ignorant that ask every high character in a zone to
buff them. There is nothing worse then seeing message after message "That
spell would not have taken effect" because some idiot has been buffed by
everyone from high level clerics to shamans to enchanters before they get to
you. This is pretty much a routine event for me, at least once a month.
Considering I probably don't buff more then 4-5 beggars a month it is a
pretty high percentage.
