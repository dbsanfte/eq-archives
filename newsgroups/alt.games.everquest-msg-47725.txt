And there is the chance that maybe, just maybe, this is the first time he
has ever posted to a newsgroup and didn't know about alt.test. I personally
wouldn't know about it unless people here didn't flame and attack those
people, like Vector, who do most their short little tests.

I know that when I ask my news server for a listing of all of the newsgroups
available, it is well over 10,000 possible groups. Do you expect someone who
is new to read through all of those until he sees alt.test, and then say,
"Hey, that must be where I can post to see if it my news reader is working"?

Of course, he could've posted here, asking "Does anybody know if there is a
newsgroup I can go to to post a test?", but then that would have probably
eaten up more bandwith than his original post. And, subsequently, it is the
people who complain about it that end up wasting more bandwith.

I read this group on  daily basis, posting only occasionally when I think I
can offer some help (which can accomplish something), and even more rarely
when I have something to say about manners (which accomplishes nothing).
There are many, many unwritten rules about newsgroup posting, and you just
can't expect everyone to know them all. In fact, as I write this, OE has
started my response above yours. If I remember correctly, people have been
flamed for top-posting, something I never would've dreamed would offend
people, so I will make sure to cut and paste and put it at the end.

Thanks for listening, and sorry for the wasted bandwith. And speaking of
bandwidth, his little test probably ate up less than the 4 line signature
you have at the end of your post. I have no problem with it, and I think it
is great when people individualize their posts or share things they feel are
personally important, but in reality isn't is it as worthless as the "crap"
you feel the test post is?
