Actually, this guy is lying.  I'm the trustworthy one.  I know this for the
following reason:  The way he's typing, using numbers instead of letters to
make what he's saying both (1) harder to type, and (2) harder to read, is
usually referred to as l33t sp33k.  It's a language used by an online scam
gang known as the D00ds.  Never trust a d00d.  They'll steal the very shirt
off your back.  They'll kill your gerbil, too.  They're bad, bad people.  If
you ever meet a d00d, bring a shotgun or other deadly weapon.  They may try
to mug you and steal everything you own, leaving you broken and dying with
words like "l33t", "d00d", and "3v3n" scrawled on your face and surrounding
pavement in your own blood.  Trust me.  I know.
