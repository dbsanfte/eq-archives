I don't roleplay much but I like to when I can.If someone else is I'll
try to play along. Unfortunately, I'm in a raiding guild and
roleplaying really doesnt work well on raids. Also, I'm a cleric, and
I may be busy or otherwise unwilling to do a rez at the moment, but a
well roleplayed request will often times make me change my mind.
