Yeah but you will eventually run into serious problems such as needing
resses like I did just now before the server went down (sometimes you
can't res the corpse after server back up) I ran around in shadow
haven and fungus grove /ooc ing that I had a corpse in echo and could
drag it to either zone. About 10 minutes before the server went down I
got a res. 

Sure, people might really like it before resses are critical but at
level 55 resses are pretty darn critical. The problem on this server
eventually will be a total lack of the ability to communicate to get
help. The fact that SOL zones are FREAKING HUGE will make that much
more difficult also (no one is going to be close enough to hear you
/shout even ) Sometimes you die or have problems at weird times and
your friends or people in your guild who are on then can't res you.

This lack of of options to communicate will eventually cause huge
problems for players if it isn't now. The fact that everyone is anon
will compound the problem because a desperate person will have no real
recourse but to individually ask every name they see if they are a
cleric and could res them or if they are a druid and could port them.
