Loda Kai Caverns are great exp thru 16 or so, you'll want
a group at the low end of that if you aren't twinked.

Also at the low end of that the Loda Kai brigand/thug
camp is good solo, a constant chain of blues to fight, and
a wealth of quest items dropping.

There is a Gor Taku/Shak Drakka camp just up the hill from
the Loda Kai cave which I worked out much of 16 and 17 on,
ranging blue to yellow, quite soloable once you break it...
but I'm not sure that screwing both Shak Drakka and
Gor Taku factions is really the best way to go.

Now I'm up thru the pass into the other half of Shadeweaver,
hunting Firefall Saureks, which are plentiful and blue to
yellow to me at 18... along with the occaisional Charred
Corpse (yellow to "time to make that long run back to the
Dancers" red)  There are lots more good targets over
on this side, but few and far between are hunting partners,
and its not good solo country just yet.

Hollowshade Moor and Paladul Caverns also have their
adherants, but I'm finding Shadeweaver much more
enjoyable, personally.  Hollowstone my pulls are either
long or Adds are too much trouble (rhinobeetles backstab,
nasty when then decide to add from behind) and Paladul...
well, I leave to your imagination the joys of running a pet
around in a dungeon with poor pathing setup.
