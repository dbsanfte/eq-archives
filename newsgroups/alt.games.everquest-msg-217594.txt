Go to Nathyn's place inside Katta.  Out front, there are two guards and two
guard sonic wolves.  Harmony all four, use Call of Karana on one of the
guard sonic wolves, and use it to take one of the guards.  Once the guard is
dead dispell the wolf and kill it.  Repeat with the other two.

Great XP for the four of them.  It's like quadding without the stress.
