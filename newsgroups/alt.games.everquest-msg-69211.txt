Actually, they did give the option to load the textures to your hard drive.
I tried it and it works well. Only problem
now is that my hard drive thrashes around a bit whenever I enter a zone I
haven't been in for a while. But that was
last patch ... Actually some of the glitches they fixed do have an impact on
the graphic engine since it wastes time
drawing something that shouldn't be seen. Not much time, but at this point I
think Verant is trying to get even the
smallest details right to smooth out performance. What they did since SoL is
almost triple the poly count while adding
textures that almost double the detail. EQ is about 4 years old and the
graphics were getting a bit dated. They are
trying to "keep up with the Joneses" or the MMORPG's of this year. Hang in
there. I have been through all the patches
and expansions since the beginning and, while sometimes it seems like they
are just randomly tweaking things, in the
end they have almost ALWAYS delivered.
