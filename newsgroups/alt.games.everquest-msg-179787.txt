It happens rarely with pick-up groups.  However, the good groups realize
this and this is why the cleric is the looter with split turned off.  But in
a lot of end-game zones (pre-PoP as I don't have it so I cannot say much
about its zones), even this sometimes doesn't recover the costs.  For
example, in Velks, there's really only one camp where clerics as looter come
out ahead monetarily (makes consistently more than the cost of symbols
camping there) and that camp is the tents.  Even the top's mobs don't drop
much coin or valuable items that the group will just let the cleric keep.
When I was doing Velks, I just ate the cost of symbols when in any camp but
tents and viewed tents as the time to hopefully make up for all the rest of
the time in the zone.  In talking to puller/MT tanks (tanks that commonly
took on these roles) and chanters, almost all of them understood this.  They
knew I was making several hundred plat being the looter in tents but
realized this basically made up for being their cleric at the other camps in
Velks.  And even then, I just broke even.  Unfortunately, it was also rather
common that other classes didn't understand this system in Velks.  Necros
were the worst.  They'd want an exact split of the loot and even going down
to the paws that drop.  Fortunately, us clerics talked to each other and
we'd just make each other aware of such players so next time when that
player was seeking a group in Velks, s/he wouldn't get an invite into the
tents group.  This was very easy as us clerics were almost always group
leaders and, even if we weren't, if we didn't want an invite to go out to
someone, only a foolish leader would go against our wishes.

Yes, I realize that.

Being a cleric, I've only viewed bards for mainly their mana and mez songs
and realize that their mana song is only for in between the fights.
Chanters were naturally always preferred over bards for my little cleric
because of this since their mana spells did their job all the time.
However, I always found bard players to be great fun to have in a group and
would commonly always try to get one in my groups ... even if we already had
a chanter.  Bards are a very versatile class and always seems to be made up
of very friendly players.  And whatever buffer the group lacked, the bard
seemed to be able to make up for.  Couldn't do them all but could commonly
twist four songs (bards being the only class that gains skill points in
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) which enabled them to be a fairly good replacement
for a shammy/druid or chanter.

As for expensive gear, that's the case with all classes.  As for clerics,
they first work to raise their Wisdom to 200 then start working on raising
their mana, AC, and HP then, if you want to hunt in ToV, resists.
Personally, I never really worried about my AC or HP.  In fact, I commonly
don't cast symbol on my little cleric.  However, because of this approach,
I'm probably was less tolerant of bad players.  Pullers that commonly
over-pull and/or don't keep in mind my mana level (which is pretty much the
same thing as over-pulling); tanks that cannot keep aggro on themselves;
nukers that don't understand the concept of aggro management; bards that
don't twist at least three songs during battles (and always switched to mana
song in between them); buffers that don't keep buffs up without being told
(the trick is simply casting the buff on yourself first so when yours starts
to flash, you know it is time to refresh everyone else's before theirs
begins to flash); back-up healers that don't heal up everyone after a fight
so I can just use my mana for when it is needed during a fight (this is
probably the most common problem I still encounter in groups); and chanters
... hmmm ... you know, I rarely have ever come across a high-level chanter
that doesn't know their job and know it well.  :-)

To solo, you have to take into the equation how much getting KEIs will cost.
If you're lucky, an EQ friend that plays a chanter will be nearby which you
can always bum one off of.  But usually, you'll need to donate to get KEI
and that really cuts into your loot quick and usually doesn't make soloing
worthwhile.  Without KEI, you'll just simply go insane waiting for your mana
to regenerate.
