Greetings, Jim. Guide Creamy Goodness here - thankyou for your petition!
Gandalfthewizard *is* a blatant violation of the naming policy, since
you are only allowed the word 'The' as part of a GM-awarded title, you
are not allowed an implied title. I have escalated this to GM Conan, who
has changed the name of the player in question to be simply 'Gandalf'.
Hope that helps...
