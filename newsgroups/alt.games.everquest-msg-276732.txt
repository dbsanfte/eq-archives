A GM on Venril Sathir recently respawned all of Yxtta when the door to the
Primals cave was bugged and wouldn't let us in. Didn't fix the door, so he
summoned us past it and we proceeded to kill the primals, including one
that wasn't up before the GM respawned the zone :)

Ubisoft servers don't share customer service with the SOE ones though,
it's all handled in-house and we don't have the new petition system.
Policy also differs and is not as rigidly adhered to.

I've also in the past seen GMs kill spawns that were below the world and
such.
