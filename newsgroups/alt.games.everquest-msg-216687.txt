I was thinking of this ,that it would be nice to have a "locker box" or
"moth balls" to hold your character in.
From what I Know you can only have your character on their data base for 3
months after that they erase it.
My thought is to have a locker box that will save your data as long as you
pay ,like $5 or less a month ...you can't play him or her but you are sure
after a year he or she is still there without paying the full price.
What say you?
