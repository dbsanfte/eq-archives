All depends on where you are and who is LFG.
I have been in plenty of groups where we were missing
certain key classes, healer, tank, slower. The group trudges
along and when that key class finally is added its rack and
stack time.

Its always been one of my biggest complaints about EQ, the class
interdependence is fine but it gets so magnified at the high levels
it gets ridiculous. I should be able to get together 5 or 6 random
classes and have a decent group, that should be 75% as effective
as a so called 'perfect' group.

At the lower levels the mix is fine, you can get together almost any
set of classes and do just fine. At the high levels its poor at best.
