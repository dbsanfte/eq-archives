I can't say for certain but it should. You can wield it (I remember having a
monk usable piercer at one time, I think they fixed it though). The biggest
problem is that it will only proc on a successful hit. And with 0 skill
you'll whiff a great deal, even on greens. My enchanter (2hb skill ~ 50).

At any rate, unless you have bad bad outpost faction it should be easy
enough to get. If it doesn't work you're out what, 15-20pp?
