Another difference is that Shaman and Druids get Spirit of Wolf whilst
Clerics get an ability to gate someone to their home city (useful only in
that the self-gate ability of everyone has a long refresh time).  Also,
druids and shaman get animal form spells at 20 (well, defilers have wraith
form, but you get the idea), while clerics get...um...I'm not sure what.
Still haven't figured that one out.  Hopefully I won't have reason to feel
grumpy when I get to that level.

THere is also armor differences...at level 20 the cleric subclasses wear
heavy armor, shaman medium, and druids very light. Supposedly this is
balanced by druids having high HP and clerics low HP and shaman in the
middle. I have no idea how this plays out in reality, since I'm only 14 at
the moment.

Don't druids also get damage shields? I thought I saw some of those on the
spell list. And while shaman get slow, and druids DSs, clerics get AC
debuffers. I personally have found that the AC debuffer is pretty handy
when soloing...usually don't have time/power to use it in group
situations.
