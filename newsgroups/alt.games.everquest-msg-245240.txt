The

There are some nice places to exp in LoY, even without this ZEM hotspot.
Was getting 3% per kill doing elementals in Nadox with my shaman from around
46-50.  Loot is also ok here (blue diamonds drop in dulak from the easy boat
for example), and also some pretty nice items from named (soulstripper for
one).

In general, the exp in LoY isn't great, but I do like all the zones (havent
actually been to hates fury yet..been meaning to).  Nadox / Dulak / Gunthak
and Torigan are all fun though.

Most people dont visit or seem to like LoY though :)
