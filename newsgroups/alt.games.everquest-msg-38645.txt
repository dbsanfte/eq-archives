I pretty much agree. The newsgroup was literally overrun with people that
held the same exact opinion when the game came out. I just think it isn't
feasible at this stage of the game and probably counter productive to the
percieved market I *think* VI may be targetting.

Let's face it, there is a rationalization process that goes on. Over all the
user base hates newbie hell so for the last two years they have been telling
themselves "The Big Lie" so often that it is now accepted as fact. The Big
Lie can be everything from "My level 50 earned that item" to "Twinked
characters are good for groups" to justify putting uber weapons and
equipment on a new character.

There's two types of bullshiter, the type of person that will try and
bullshit you and the type of person that will try and bullshit you and
damned if they don't believe it themselves.

Unfortunately no one seems to remember those other voices anymore. Part of
the self deception process or newbs to the newsgroup I guess.

Faced with the current user base, your suggestion is no longer a viable
alternative.

There are two ways of doing things, you can either raise the roof or lower
the floor.

That so many people object to newbs being able to have a game path other
then via becoming twinks is kind of narrow minded and self centered. It is
so stupid that a level 50 would have problems with say, turning in your
guild note gives you a 14 AC tunic or netted gloves for a monk, it knocks
the wind out of me. I mean who really gives a shit? Is it really rational to
be jealous of a level 6 because they can pick up a ~3 int 2 AC ring in a new
dungeon and you<global> can't? Petty, petty, petty.

Sounds like "its all about me."
