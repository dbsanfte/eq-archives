Wanted a change of pace from my main whos recent activities are mostly sitting 
LFG forever in BOT and POV and rarely finding a group.  I noticed my brother 
had a froggy shaman on his 2nd rarely used account who was lvl 24.  So I 
rolled up a froggy warrior on my account so I could 2 box them together.  Got 
the warrior up to lvl 19 using only the shaman buffs and heals.  I know they 
could grp now and both get exp but I'm not going to do that until the warrior 
is 24 also so they can go up 'together'.

I need some help with some terms that I've heard before but do not know what 
they mean.  I'm talking about some of the skills.  I pretty sure I understand 
Block and Dodge.  I'm confused by Riposte and Parry though.  If I had to guess 
I would say Riposte is when a mob hits you but somehow the damage gets bounced 
back to the mob.  Kinda like it's hitting itself.  Please correct me if I'm 
wrong.  I have no idea what a Parry is.  Please explain for me.

I want to keep all of my weapon skills up and I've almost got them maxed.  
Only problem is my piercing weapon is a 2 hander and I'd like to dual wield as 
much as I can so I need to find a good 1 handed piercer.  Can anyone recommend 
a good one for less than 500 pp?  For my 1H blunt I've got a Goranga Spiked 
Club which my main got for me and my 1H Slasher is a Centi Shortsword.  If 
there are better weapons out there that are cheap please let me know.

One final question and it has to do with the Bash skill.  When I bash it tells 
me I must equip a shield.  Should I even bother with this?  I'm guessing it's 
better to be dual wielding cause a second weapon in the offhand is going to 
put out a lot more damage than a Bash will, correct?  Thanks for any help to 
these questions.
