Not really. What sorts of conflicts would a perfect communist utopian 
face? I can think of several... infinitely more if you allow aliens into 
the mix.

Extrapolated from what??!! That is the fundamental problem... ST just 
makes a magic wish about where humanity will be... it pretty much 
completely ignores the totality of our recorded history. If you want to 
'extrapolate the future' 1984 might be somewhere along the line at the 
end of the line...but not ST.

And that makes ST poor SF, although, perhaps, a good fantasy.

Blind optimists maybe.

Asimov's Foundation Series explored the utopian quest quite extensively. 
 From his extrapolation of life on Solaria (in Foundation and Earth) 
which was a credible 'utopia' of sorts, to the 'masters' from the Second 
Foundation, to the integration of the Gaians...  But in each case they 
were significantly non-human anymore...and with 20,000 years-ish from 
now to then... and that was the point: You can't take humans-like-us 
move 20 generations, hope we've magically evolved and put them in a 
credible communist-utopia.

And Asimov, like ST practically exclusively dealt with atruists. His 
work seldom needed an 'evil villain' to move the plot.

We agree. You misread, which may be the result my being unclear. I meant 
that ST lacked subtlety because it was black and white.  Ie the lack of 
subtlety is the result of pitting black vs white (reads as: there is a 
lack of subtlety is because ST is black and white)
