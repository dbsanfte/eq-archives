No. But he should be the best equipped. That is not the same as
getting everything. It's like this, for an easy example: with plate
drops in ToV he is the first one to get a BP, but other than that
everyone just gets a piece at a time. So legs drop, he gets them,
gloves drop someone else, bracer a third person, hat a fourth, bp then
drops the first guy gets it, and so on and so forth.

The guy who deserves it the most is the guy who has done the most for
the guild in the eyes of its officers. If you don't have officers you
trust with that kind of responsibility, get better officers.

No, it's not my argument at all. But he should certainly, if he has
done more for the guild, have better gear than the L52. Period.

It IS acceptable to many if not most top end guilds, no "may" about
it.

You just notice them more than the other forty nine out of fifty L60s
that never change guilds.

Which is not my argument.
