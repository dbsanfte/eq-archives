Hey there ;)

Level 60 ranger. I guess I know what I'm talking about. A bit.

Ok, we're talking about using this weapon primary hand. The
short answer is the Lamentation will do more damage at high levels.

It works like this: The ratios are close - 9/19, 14/27, and for
an *offhand* weapon the LS would be clearly superior.

However, as you rise in levels your primary hand (only) gains a
damage bonus that is applied *every* swing. This is fixed, so,
lets say, to illustrate it, our weapons are:

5/10
20/40 

Exactly the same ratio, yes? But one clearly faster than the other.

Now lets say our damage bonus is 10. Your ratio now looks like:

15/10
30/40

Suddenly the faster weapon looks much more appealing. The exact
calculation is more complex than this and much discussed on many
web sites (try the rangers glade, www.interealms.com/ranger),
but this illustrates the principle.

Faster = More damage at higher levels when ratios are similar.

That said, Faster also = more aggro. At anything below level 54 I
would think a wurmslayer still cant be beat for the price, assuming
folks are still completing the quest, and assuming you have more
than 100 sta.
