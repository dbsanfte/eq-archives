Prices are in no way fixed . They rely completely on both supply and demand
. This is diffrent for every server and will change on your server in a
small timespan . For instance a month ago a lamentation blade was still
worth thousands of plat . If you are trying to sell one now take whatever
you can get since its real value will not stop falling and is below 200pp
right now :p
