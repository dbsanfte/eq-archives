Headed into Permafrost with a shaman friend to help her get a permafrost
snowball for totemic quest.  First "camp" spot i decide to check on is the
alchemist.  Suprisingly uncamped and dropped the cloak.  (Subsequent attempts to
get the cloak has resulted in about ten pairs of leggings, with too many ph or
even skipped spawns to count)

Nope, that's just the wonders of the Everquest Random Number Generator (tm)

Not sure why someone would disband in such a situation, unless it had been
happening repeatedly for all scheduled raids.  
As to the pique of anger, it makes enough sense to understand, but fit of anger
would make more sense.   Yes pique is a strange word :

American heritage dictionary of the english language defines pique as:
A feeling of resentment or vexation arising from wounded pride or vanity.
1. To cause to feel resentment or vexation; injure the feelings of.
2. To Provoke; arouse; spur: The portrait piqued my curiosity.
