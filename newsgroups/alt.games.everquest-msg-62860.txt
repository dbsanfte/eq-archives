Oooh! Oooh! I can be impressive too!

I met Ernie Shavers when I was a kid. Dad insisted. Apparently he was
a boxer or something. Anyhow, he was very polite.

I met Jonathan Frakes, too. He was quite charming, and very tall.

I know Dan Bern personally. He used to come to dinner at my parents
house from time to time, back in the 80s. He stayed in my dorm room
for a weekend once when I got him a gig at my college. And now he's
released his fifth album.

Oh, and James Marsters, who plays Spike on Buffy the Vampire slayer.
My SO used to work in the same restaurant as him. I've been to parties
with him. He once accidentally set a friends couch on fire. He's not
British, and that's not his real hair color. Duh.

I rock, etc.

Big effing deal.
