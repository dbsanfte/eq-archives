Thus written by an idiot who actually believes that Bush is telling him the
truth, is an American diehard no matter what the truth is, has absolutely NO
discernment between good and evil, knows nothing about truth and
righteousness, nor God, nor prophecy, for that matter. Don't state anything
in the name of God, you are a cowardly, ignorant,  subordinate of America's
lies, greed and powerlust and has NO clue of any truths of God.


PS, to those who are angry at crossposting. What are you afraid to think
about anything but your worthless cars and games? Well, while you are waxing
your mercedes and playing your games, your destruction comes and you really
should be warned about it, it is only fair.
