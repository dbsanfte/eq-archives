Doh, yes, I do mean OT Jboots.  All JBoots are, of course, AC JBoots.

Yep, thats the problem here, you are picking on mobs that are too
difficult for your abilities to be efficient.

As you level up, the mobs power rises faster than yours does.  The
explaination for this is that at low levels everyone is supposed to
solo, and the con of mobs is set for that dynamic.  Then you are
supposed to get a partner, and mobs con out that way.  Then
you are meant to graduate to half groups, mostly full groups, full
groups, till at the high end mobs are conned out for a couple
group mini raid.

The key here for you is not exp per mob, its exp per hour.  Lets
say you find mob A, B, and C, where you can often kill mob A
and get a half blue, always kill mob B and get a quarter blue,
and also always kill mob C and get a eighth of a blue.  But
A takes five minutes and uses up all your mana, so you have to
med back to full, killing one every 15 minutes. Mob B takes 2 and
a half minutes and uses half your mana up, so you can kill one
every 7.5 minutes.  Mob C takes only two minutes and uses less of your
mana than you make back medding during the fight... so you can
kill one a minute.  In an hour, thats 4 A for 2 blue, 8 B for 2 blue,
and 24 C (cause it takes some time to pull them) for 3 blue... not
to mention I said often kill... that A set probably includes some
"run away" episodes and perhaps even some "oops, need a rez"
episodes.

As a cleric, I don't really have access to type C mobs, my pet kills
itself between fights, so anything I'm going to kill is going to cost me
mana.  I do have A and B to pick between, though, and I'll tell
you, its B all the way.  Type C fights involve a melee partner, and
thats often much better exp than anything I OR the melee can do per
hour.  As a mage, you have the melee partner without having to
split the exp!
