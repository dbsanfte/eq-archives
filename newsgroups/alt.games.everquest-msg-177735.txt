4.5 years in a state penitentiary for thinking about something and
communicating it.

Since communication is currently the only way to let anyone know what you
are thinking, if you can be punished just for communicating something then
by definition you are being punished for thinking. I believe the 1st
amendment to the constitution mentions something about the freedom of
speech, now probably says you don't have it unless you make a certain amount
of money.

Example:

Guy walks up to girl and communicates that he is furious at her and wants to
kill her, but doesn't actually do anything physical just expressing anger.
Girl calls 911 and Guy is sent to prison for 15 years without a trial.

Does that sound like a particularly healthy society? One that is so afraid
of other people that no one really trusts anyone else enough to express what
they are really thinking?

If I could I would start the 3rd set of plagues right now as this 2nd set is
going to slow, maybe I just havent been reading the news. I'll do that as
the news usually gives me some comfort.

Perhaps you should try reading the book "1984" by George Orwell, you can
tell society is about to collapse by the roads and the art, but you can tell
if a society is about to be enslaved by how language is treated.

Most of you are going to be enslaved very soon, probably 98% of the current
world's population. I think this 3.5 years is going by intolerably slow but
it will pick up once I start to calm down.
