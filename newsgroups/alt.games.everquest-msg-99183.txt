And there's the rub.  I was chatting on the phone with a RL friend who had
created a Halfling Ranger last night while we were playing.  He ripped
through the first 5 lvls in no time, then everything on the Rivervale side
of the wall greened out to him.  When he headed to the other side of wall,
he started dying.  Why?  Because his 1HS was so low that he couldn't hit
anything.

I could hear the frustration in his voice ... "I can't hit this stupid orc,
and he's lighting me up.  Dammit!  I'm sure glad I'm not losing XP on these
... "

One wonders if they realized that would happen.
