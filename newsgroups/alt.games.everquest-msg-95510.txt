You've mentioned "this" newsgroup several times, and it seems that you
mean rec.games.chess.misc.  Well, that's not "this" newsgroup to me.
I'm reading this in alt.games.everquest.  That's my "this" newsgroup.

Over here in "this" newsgroup, spam like "Hal"s *is* the most
objectionable spam.  Pretty much everything else we get is one shot
stuff, not designed to draw responses.  Hal's is *designed* to cause
flamewars in groups that it is not on-topic for.  Go take a look on
Google at all the copies he posted to various sets of 4 groups, and see
how many you can find even a remotely plausible justification (like your
Fischer one for chess).
