Well if you weren't using PB AOE then you were doing
a maximum of 4 mobs at a time, right?  Seems to me that
some classes get PB AOE very very early on, and you might
look into that as an option.  The key to this plan is being
able to take out LOTS of mobs with little more mana spent
than you would in taking out just a few.

I remember one of my first characters ( mage or wizard, was
a couple years ago and I didn't stick with those two long )
had one of these at either first or fourth level.  At the time
they seemed entirely useless...

Very interested to hear how your attempts to use this sort
of strategy at low levels work out.
