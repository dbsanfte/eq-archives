Actually, only the people who think that Druids are PETA-nazis and
think they're role playing just because they don't hunt animals think
this. Personally, I think of druids as closer to the Native American
philosophy -- hunt only what you need, use all of what you hunt.

Anyone except Druids, Rangers, and Beastlords will be naturally KOS to
most wolves, bears, etc. The three exceptions are usually amiable to
most of the lower level ones (There are higher level animal mobs that
these classes are KOS to anyway). The druids at the druid ring will
assist any animals that a PC is in combat with, even if the animal
attacked the PC.

>2, If so, can faction be improved, and how?

Nothing can be done to move this faction one way or another (Except
for animals that give a visible faction hit when killed, such as those
in Jaggedpine).

>3, Or is it just that wolves will attack anything sat down, or even
>standing,  apart from Druids?

See the answer to #1, that pretty much explains it. Whether it'll
attack when standing depends on level. If the animal is green to the
person, chances are it usually won't attack. Overall it depends on the
mob whether or not it's "brave" enough to attack a standing PC.

>4, Had we been grouped at the time, would Druids have also attacked me?

Only if you had helped him in any way, either by attacking the animal
or buffing/healing the cleric.

No need to worry about that... As long as you don't hunt the druids or
treants (note Arboreans in GFay, while they look like treants, aren't
treants. They're "weeds". )
