   Just started tailoring with my ranger (got her skill up to 6 so 
far; she's strong for an elf, but not all that bright).  Naturally,
with this impressive success, I'm looking forward to making the fleeting
quiver.  I just have to wonder what the stats on the thing are.  Massive
weight reduction of the nearly weightless arrows that go in?  A 
significant increase in bow speed over the gain one gets from having
a regular tailored quiver (a difference I can tell, btw).
   She also working on blacksmithing, in order to make arrowheads.  
I dunno if the forged hooked and silver arrowheads are cheaper
then the merchant prices are, but I'm going to make the experiment 
to find out. And also steel shafts.  If it turns out that this use
of the skill _doesn't_ result in a significant reduction in price,
it will be a long, long time till she's rich enough to raise her 
fletching skill up to 200.
