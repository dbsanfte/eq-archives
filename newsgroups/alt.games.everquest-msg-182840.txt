Since when was he designed as a 1 on 1 encounter?

Sorry but I call BS on you're whole argument... theres a BIG difference with
a 60 person RZ raid and a 160 person raid, a 1 MA tanked mob, and a raid
rezzing/throwing bodies at a mob to drop it

Ok,

Ok.. so I can only take pride in my kills when I solo something?

Zerged by who?

A long long time ago, when HoT armour was something my guild dreamed of,
when Kunark armour was the norm and we were learning to kill Vindi, we did a
3 group flawless kill of Trakanon.   No shamans, no big group resist buffs,
no AA's, no uber gear or weaponary.  The average killing back then was 40+,
boy we sure zerged that dragon!

I have np with allied guilds doing mobs, 20 of guildA and 20 of guildB is no
more of a zerg than 40 of Guild3 (and theres not all that many raid mobs
where40 people would be called a zerg force) - I think small guilds who
build alliances are absolutely fine.   My point was, if faced with the
following 2 options

1) Learn the RZ encounter, pluck away until we got the method and execution
down and kick his ass
2) Use 100 of my guildies, and 100 of an ally guild, and just throw bodies
at him till he finally drops

There is only 1 option for me, period.  Number 2 will never happen.

Encounters are tuned for a general number of people, if a dev makes an
encounter for a 40 or so person raid, and said mob is killed twice, firstly
by a raid of 30, secondly by a raid of 70, would you call both of them
zergs?
