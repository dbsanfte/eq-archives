He's not in the bank ("market") block, but rather before you reach it.
Come out of the bank and run straight across the square untill you have
to zig-zag left then right to exit the bank block and come into the next
block. Now turn left along that alley and look for the blue building on
your right. If you're KOS you wont'have to go in to find him. He'll come
rushing out to greet you.
