The earth pet makes it much easier for a warrior to tank. Other tanks
have a much easier time keeping aggro. It's just up to the rogue to
keep his distance and evade. (Other melees also need to watch their
proximity to the mob.) The warrior then is highest on both the Hate
aggro list and the Prox aggro list. When there is no snare, root is
better than having runners. 

That said, I usually find that air or water pets are best in the group
because someone in the group can snare or root runners. Air pet is
nice when there are casters because it stuns. The water pet really
help the damage per second with it's backstabs. I usually give the
tank the choice since he has to position the water pet (or I am going
to have to call the pet off & reposition it, which cuts the DPS).
