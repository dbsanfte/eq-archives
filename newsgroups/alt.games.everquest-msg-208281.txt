That is the traditional route, as it uses all vendor purchased items.  
Skillups at that level are a lot rarer than at lower levels, you just got 
unlucky with that run.  Be sure that you have either your INT or your WIS 
as high as you can possibly get it, get a KEI if you need it to boost your 
INT/WIS.
