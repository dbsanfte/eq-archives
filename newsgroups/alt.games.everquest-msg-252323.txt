Yes, this is all true. That's because the only real opportunity for
growth for MS is on the server side... so that's what they are after
now. Maybe that's why their stuff on the desktop has changed so little
in the last 10 years.

IBM is still a huge company, and will likely always BE a huge company.
However, they lost the PC industry they created in the late 80s and
their attempts to get their foot back in the door are laughable.
They'd probably be better off not even trying.

Matured? Like the mainframe market matured in the 70s? The PC didn't
take over the world by trying to do what Mainframes could do. Makers
of PC hardware and software catered to individuals and mom & pop small
businesses. I'd tend to agree that the emphasis now is on pleasing
corporate customers. That's a mistake. A mistake that's been made
before. Innovation in the computer industry is bottom up, not
top-down. And of all industries, the computer industry should know
best that you either change or you die. The improvements are so minor
and so few and far between in the PC industry now that it really
*does* remind me of the Big Iron days of the 1970s. I hope the PC
doesn't share the Mainframe's fate, but if it goes on like this much
longer it will.
