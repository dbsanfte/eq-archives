I believe you may be missing some of the point that those that are against the
Wurmslayers in a warriors hands are making about the WS over other hands. It is
not the damage dealing fact that many of them have a problem with. It is the
reduced Taunt Factor that they have a problem with.

Face it, the primary job of any warrior in a experience grind group is to be the
one that gets hit. It is to be the primary tank for that group of 6. The goal
here for efficentency is for the warrior to take every single hit that a mob
swings. It is an almost unrealistic goal but it still exists. If a mob attacks a
person in a group, you want them to be attacking the warrior in the group.

To achieve this goal, a warrior must produce and sustain a greater level of Taunt
Factor then every other member of the group. We know that many things are
factored into a person Taunt Factor. Things like procs, heals, mez, debuffs,
snares, attack distance, AND weapon speed. We know that the faster your weapons
you use the more likely you are to produce a bigger Taunt Factor. This is been
proven time and time gain at site like the Safehouse and Ranger Glade.

As it stands, warriors are woefully under-skilled in their ability to produce and
sustain a Taunt Factor. They have exterminely limited in what they have available
to them to increase their Taunt Factor. Their choises are Weapon Choice, Attack
Distance, Taunt Button, and Weapon Proc. That is it. They do not have the ability
to Heal to produce Taunt Factors. They cannot snare to produce Taunt Factors.
They cannot mez or debuff to produce Taunt Factor. Those for items listed above
is all they have to increase the amount of Taunt Factor they can generate.

Using the Wurmslayer over a weapon like Jade Mace, CCS, Lamination, etc is by
default reducing the Taunting Factor of one of the 4 listed in an already short
list of options. It is the equivalent of tieing ones hand behind their back
before they fight. Remember, a warriors ability to tank is their primary job
function. Damage dealing is secondary to that primary job. Using a Wurmslayer
will be less of a Taunt then using a faster weapon and warriors do not have to
many other options to choose from to increase their Taunt Factor.

The agrument of haste increasing the effectiveness of Wurmslayer to produce a
Taunt Factor does not hold water in this case. The reason it is not valid in this
case is that the same haste that would increase the Taunt Factor of the
Wurmslayer would also increase the Taunt Factor of the Jade Mace and other
weapons. Furthermore, any haste placed on the warrior to increase his/her Taunt
Factor would also be place on other melees present in the group. That would
nullify any advantage granted to the warrior. Finally, regardless of the amount
of haste placed on any melee class to increase the amount of Taunt Factor their
weapons produce, the Taunt Factors from Heals, Debuffs, and Snares will be
greater and will need a lot of work to counter but those expected to maintain the
mobs attention.

Wurmslayer is a poor weapon in the hands of higher level warriors soly on the
basis that it reduces their ability to maintain the mobs attention when compaired
to other weapons that are faster and can produce almost the same if not more
damage then the Wurmslayer. The primary job of a warrior is to take the
punishment of the mobs a group is fighting. Reducing their ability to maintain a
mobs attention with a class already majorily hendered by its lack of attention
getting techniques is not a wise idea.
