I'd have to agree with Valien here, skip the 128, that isn't going to
progress far enough.  It might cost a little more right now, but it is worth
it to invest in a better video card so you aren't in the same spot a year
from now.  Get something that will last you for the next 4 years if you can.

For EQ with the new textures and all the models you will want the 64 meg
card and 512 RAM, you don't need a gig or more in the RAM department if you
have adequate processor and video support.

Best of luck Brian, let us know how it works out for you!
