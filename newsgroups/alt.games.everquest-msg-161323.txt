HAHAHA, you are really out of the loop.  EC is a ghost town.  Bazaar on 
Luclin has replaced 90% of auctioning.  Some people still try but 
seriously, much easier to leave a mule on 24/7 in the bazaar.

Again, most people who have Luclin head directly for Paludal Caverns 
until around 24 or 26, then Marus Seru or Netherbian Lair until 30.

Did you buy Planes of Power too?  By far, the best way to get around is 
by clicking the books found in newbie areas (there's one in everfrost 
somewhere) and going to Plane of Knowledge.  Unlike other planes, PoK is 
reachable at level 1.  Best place to buy spells, all your low level 
spells are there.  And no faction issues, I love it.

New areas added: Jagged Pine, Warrens and Stonebrunt, may be others, 
check your patcher and click Optional zones to get them.

If you get any weird bugs with wolfs looking like tigers or somesuch 
oddness, delete your .txc files and re-patch.

Did I miss anything?
