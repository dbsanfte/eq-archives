Hi,

think is time to say a few words to the "specialists" that think testing is
impossible and SOE is doing a great job with their patches ....

>(1) Software agents (simulated players)... do I need to say why this
>    won't work? AI just isn't there yet.

You wont need AI as the abilities of every char are limited ... Every little
company that develops networkprograms will do and has to do testruns with
programs called "stressemulators". With them you can simulate a very heavy
load while checking ALL possible situations a char could cause ... INCLUDING
eg ZONING. Like I said, every small companies will do this ... too much for
SOE ? ( you also should think about the available code with their
pathingroutines ect. ) Maybe VERY special situations could not be discovered
this way but common ones like zoning ect. are ....

No record necessary, but would be a possibility to "record" situations a
char could cause like talking to NPCs, selling, banking ect...

You say you cant force paying players to betatest ? What are we doing all
the time on "Live"-servers ?

>(4) Pay a small army to do your testing. "Subscriptions are increasing to
>    US$50/month to pay for our new QC department." Similar drawbacks to
(3).

You should see the relation cost / customer .... I dont say EQ is too
expensive ... but believe me SOE gains a good profit ( and they should do
like every company should ;-) )

>Real software development projects are rarely so
>timely.

Networkupdates / patches in bigger companies are done with a quiet efficient
method : mirroring. While the data are always mirrored to another server /
backupsystem, two servers could run simultaneously and could switch without
downtime from one system to the other .... the playerdata wouldnt be
affected at all as available on both systems ... this would require maybe a
downtime for the updates to be downloaded by the players of 1 hour ... not
6-8 hours we see all patches are ... ( not included the re-re-repatches )

And please dont tell me the costs would explode because of this ... a
concern like SOE should have more than enough resources to reduce the
downtime and to test their patches better. The times you would need "an army
of testers" are gone ... like I said, every small company knows it  ...

Btw I am now for nearly 8 years projectleader
system-/communicationmanagement and think I know what I am talking about
