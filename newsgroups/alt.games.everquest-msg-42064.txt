 Of course there is a choice. The choice is made by the government and
ultimately by the people of the country who empower them. Do you think there
weren't any GOOD Germans during WWII? I guess we should have thrown down
our guns lest they got hurt in the fray.

>And sometimes, there is no other choice.
 If there is no other choice then the government is controlled by terrorist
elements
and has devolved into a terrorist government.
There is always a choice, but they chose evil over good.

Question - In your story is my character supposed to be the government?
If so, his only moral course of action would  be to do everything in his
power
to stop them and warn others.
If he had any modicum of decency he would have dealt with them before it
got this far.
The fact terrorist groups grow in power under any particular
government underscores a lack of decency and humanity on the part of that
government.
Now Big D, if my character is a poor country folk having a home invaded,
well
I guess I'm having my home invaded. I would like to mention that governments
tend to
have a whole lot more guns then any one person facing a robber.

 Quickly? How many years have they been tied up? For Christ's sake they
could have
gnawed through titanium cable by now and walked to a phone(in another
country).

 You assume the patient is sane and has moral bearing. What if he believes
god was
waiting to reward him for dying and taking some infidels with him? The kind
of patient
we're dealing with here would thank the doctor, go home and strap a bomb
around
his waist.

 Sure, throw in a harmless family of four! :) Would you like to add some
adopted
children with Downs Syndrome? Even with all of the relatives present for a
reunion,
I would not kill the family. You ask why not? I think you and I have
very different ideas about the sanctitiy of human life. Your statement
doesn't pass
the common sense test for a decent human being.

 Maybe their friend should have said, "Don't shoot me. I am human. I do not
have rabies and do not give it to others. The dog with the rabies is over
there."
That is a prudent way to keep from getting killed when someone comes for the
dog.
Just refrain from making any barking noises until they've gone.

You're all over the map on this one. I am certainly not condoning going to
war with any country
that has people that LOOK like the criminals or that had BAD THOUGHTS about
the US.
None of Jeffrey Dahmer's acquaintences should be killed for a "failure to
realize". There is no
country that has major terrorist activity and "fails to realize it". If
Dahmer's
acquantances KNEW of his actions and did nothing to prevent other
attrocities, then of course they should be held accountable. If they helped
him by giving him housing and tools of mayhem, they should
pay the ultimate price, the same price they've already exacted on their
victims. It's the fact that
Islamic fundamentalist terrorists ACT OUT their sick fantasies of ending the
lives of innocent children
and people who never so much as harbored a mean thought against the
sons-of-bitches
that makes me advocate turning them into cinders. Now that they've crossed
the line,
they can reap the consequences.

 It's obvious from your post that _you_ won't.
