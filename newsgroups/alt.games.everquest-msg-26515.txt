It works just like the Glimpse spell, from what I can tell.   It's
not very useful, but can help when you want to scout an area
or camp from a pretty safe distance.   It's nice for seeing sights
that you don't want to get a close-up look at.   The Iksar statues
in Frontier Mountains can be seen clearly via a spyglass from
the fort, for instance, but can't be seen with the naked eye at
all.    One nice side effect is that you can see farther through
the rain, which is VERY nice when you're traveling in an area
with mobs you don't want to stumble upon up-close-and-personal.
I usually travel with mine in a hotkeyed inventory slot, where I
can right-click on it as needed.

A Preserved Splitpaw Eye has the same effect (Glimpse) but
only has five charges.   If you just want to see what it looks like,
those are very cheap and easily obtainable in South Karana.
That you can put in your range slot, and also hotkey.   They
don't stack, though, so it's a pain if you do become used to
having the effect available.

As far as price and where to get one, unless you can find someone
in EC (or the market zone on your server), you can find a gnome
wizard who can port to GFay, where the two of you can run over to
Steamfont.  All the parts needed are found in the third windmill,
except for a bottle, which can be found in the hut right outside the
Ak'Anon entrance (on the right facing out of the entrance.)

If you're already around Steamfont - or can twink a mule gnome
to do it for you, you should be aware that no skill increases can
come until level 16.   Any gnome, though, *can* tinker - he just
won't get skill increases until 16th level.

His cost will be about 25 plat for parts alone, unless he's done some
faction work (not something you should expect) and has some charisma
gear.   Any wizard who can port the two of you will have a skill of 50 in
Tinkering, and the spyglass trivials at 95.   At that point, you're paying
for his failures until he makes one.   I made one on my first attempt with
a skill level of 50, but failed on the next four.   I'd suspect you can get
one for about 150pp (6 attempts) and it shouldn't be difficult to find a
gnome willing to try it out as long as you're footing the bill.   Of course,
that also has the downside of not getting a successful attempt for a
while as well.
