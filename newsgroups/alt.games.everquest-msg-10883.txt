I mainly meant dont worry about trying to increase it yet, but there isnt
much you can do at 33 to decrease it.  Killing giants or Dorfs at that level
cant really be done, and you wont find a group for it.

How did you screw up your faction? Atleast that will make it easier for him
to avoid :)

ps : The only faction you have to worry about are :

giants (pretty easy to spot)
dwarf (short)
dragon (not going to be touching this for a bit, until you kill some or hunt
in SS)
