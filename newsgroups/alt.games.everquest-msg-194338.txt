Try http://necro.eqclasses.com.  Do not woy about your tanking skills.  Your
pet *is* your tank.  Learn to fear kite (darkness/sic pet/fear/sit and
med/tap when necessary).  Always remember that you are a cloth wearing frail
caster and Little Goner will, at some point, be just that (in other words,
do not get too attached).
