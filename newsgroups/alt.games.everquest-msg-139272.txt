Root/melee is not as easy or as time-per-kill effective as other druid
strategies, at least not at higher levels, but its an excellent way to get
defense up while not slowing down your kill rate much, assuming you
are also DOTing the mob so it rots while you porcupine.

On the other hand, here I wasn't suggesting it as a real plan (I doubt
very much Celaeno is going to get exp or phat lewt off an orc pawn)
I was just making a simple demonstration of the use of the visual
display of the real attack button.
