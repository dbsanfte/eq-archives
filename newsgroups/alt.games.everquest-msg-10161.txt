     A suggestion:  Award more points for each level but no skill
gains from "using" the ability.  Instead of 5 training points total
each new level, give X trade skill points and Y weapon skill/casting
skill points.    
     EXAMPLES:
A level 5 warrior could put 5 point into trade skill and would have 30
for his weapon/combat skill increases.
The level 30 ranger would have 30 tade skill points and 10
weapon/casting skill points and 10 casting points and 10 to apply to
casting or weapon skills.  Does he increase his divination skill or
neglect it?
A level 15 mage/jeweler could put say 15 into his jewelcraft, only 5
into his combat/weapon, and 25 into his casting.  Would the mage
choose hand-to-hand or 2h blunt this level?

    Warriors could increase all 5 weapon skills and hand-to-hand;
they'd have to automatically have increases for Taunt, Kick, Bash,
etc.  The ranger would have to have automatic increases for foraging,
tracking, etc.  Shaman alchemy and rogue poison making would have to
have similar automatic increases.

     In my examples, trade skill points were based on level.  Each
class got 30 points for increasing their melee or casting skills per
level.  Notice too that mages were forbidden from exceeding 5 points
in weapon skill and warriors were not allowed any magic skills.  This
would allow a player to keep his skills current for his class/level.

Perhaps a player could dump all 30 into ONE skill (perhaps with a
higher cost penalty for exceeding his level).  That warrior is only
level 5 but watch him weild that mace like a level 7; too bad he can't
use this great new 2h blunt we picked up.  That mage can really nuke,
too bad he can't get close to the good stuff beccause his divination
(invisiblity) skill is zip.  That cleric can't conjure food but boy
can he cast Complete Heal all day.

    This brings up the question, can the warrior learn the other class
specific skills like alchemy?  I'd say no.  Class balancing would be
tough if anyone could make potions, even if a shaman could always do
it better.
