No, right answer.  You no longer need a reason to change
your surname.

http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming_faq.jsp

Under what circumstances can I get a name change?
Customer Service will change a playerï¿½s last name at his or her
request, provided that the player is level 20+ and either the
requested surname, or the requested combination of the first
name and surname does not violate the Naming Policy.  Upon
approval, this change may either result in the player receiving a
new surname or else with the removal of the surname altogether.
If your current surname violates naming policy, it may also be
changed. Your first name may never be changed unless it violates
naming policy.

So, yes, "/petition I'd like to change my surname" is the proper
command...
