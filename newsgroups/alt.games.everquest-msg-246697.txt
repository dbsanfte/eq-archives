A lot slower and a very kludgey solution to it.  Hmmm let's see .. why
don't we go buy a card which costs the same as it's main competitor and
runs games slower ... oh yes let's do that.

Not theoritically at all how many links would you like me to paste
where the ATI DX9 cards leave Nvidia in the dust?  Oh and not let's get
on to the Nvidia driver which was released specifically to counter the
Futuremark tests please.

This is a flat out lie .. the ATI drivers from Cat 3.7 to the current
4.4 work fine.

No, Nvidia won't get to the full DX9 spec till DX9.0c (not DX9.1).
Meantime ATI have replaced them in the XBox and they will continue to
smoke them in benchmarks, including the latest versions of both
manufacturers cards which are due on the shelf soon.
