As a young Shadow Knight I realized that I am a hybrid.  I learned that it
was foolish to purely rely on my melee skills, and even more foolish to
think of myself as a caster of magic.  However, I soon learned that by using
both skills wisely, and in proper balance, I could have a devastating affect
on those that were foolish enough to invoke my rage.  This became even more
apparent when I started grouping.  I soon realized that my greatest value to
a group was my ability to make a mob hate me as if I had killed its mother
and stolen its dog. I learned to obtain their wrath by casting the right
spells, at the right time, and whacking away at them till my arms got tired.
When grouped with stronger melee classes, I take the heat of them, we keep
the mob completely off balance.  When called upon to function as a primary
tank, I can effectively keep the mobs off the casters . . . if I have manna.
You see, my spells aren't the greatest, not a whole lot of direct damage
going on.  My DOT's aren't anything to write home about.  However, combined
with a few reasonable 2H slashes, they just kind of make a mob want to kill
me more than anyone else around.

The problem is that I can't med when I'm running around non stop pulling in
the next kill.  Warriors will frequently
say, "You should pull because you can FD".  SKs FD with a spell people, it's
not a skill.  If I have no manna, I can't FD.  I've found FD to be more
effective when I'm soloing under reasonably controlled circumstances, not
grouping.  But back to the point.  I realize there are times when I am the
logical choice to pull, and I do so gladly, but there are many more times
when it would make more sense for others to make the pull.  Without manna,
my effective contribution to the group is often severely diminished.
Contrary to popular belief my primary job isn't to dish it out as much as it
is to take it instead of someone else.  By itself my taunt skill is week
compared to warriors.  Maybe I can't even outdamage a ranger.  But when I
use all  my skills properly I am an asset to any group.  I'm the lightining
rod, not the lightning bolt.
