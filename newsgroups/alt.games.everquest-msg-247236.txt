I was relying on the fact that it doesn't appear in a dictionary... 
m-wonline, dictionary.com, etc...defined as meaning 'character'.

Who says it is a word? You?

3 letters a word adds up to a lot of extra carpal tunnel over a month... 
sorry it annoys you. As long as they aren't *mis*spelling full words to 
get extra x's or z's into them, tossing the big phrases 'all your base 
are belong to us' or 'u r fag!', or using numbers instead of letters I'm 
not fazed by it.

I can handle, "Pls tell me where u r?"
