Heh... this is very true...  I've been grouping a lot with a (now) 51 Necro
for about the past 15 or so levels...  and it's a perfect match..  The necro
provides the tank (his pet), he uses darkness and fear, with dots... I keep
him buffed with regen, heals, dot the mob, as well...

Now, we have died more often than I care to.  But that's generally caused by
something we did, or possibly a train...  (it's kinda hard to get off a
Succor when you're being pounded on)...  most of the time when things go
bad, I cast gate, he casts FD.
