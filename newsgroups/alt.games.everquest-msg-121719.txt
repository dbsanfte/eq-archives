Probably Klez. That thing has got enough variations there's no point
in even trying to sort out where any particular infected message
really came from. Just delete it, mutter about the idiots out there
who don't bother with even basic security measures, and wait for the
next one to hit.

Between my Lokari address and my professional one, I get sent Klez at
least a half dozen times a day.
