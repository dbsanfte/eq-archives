I've also found that Allakhazam's is falling woefully behind on keeping up 
with new quests. I'm going to cave in and clean out my bank account of old 
quest items I can't find a use for. Samantha is right about something, 
though, very few quest items you pick at random will happen to be for a 
quest that's actually useful to you. If you do find one, that will be the 
one you leave to rot on the body because you have no more space on you. :)
