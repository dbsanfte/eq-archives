True, it is a bit harder than, say, locating the SHIFT and period keys on 
your keyboard. I've always felt that if you expect people to take the time 
to read what you have to say, you should take the time to write it in the 
most intelligible way possible merely out of consideration if nothing else.

Anyway, there are other things that follow a similar irrational success 
rate as those dyes - leather padding, for instance. I got a smith up to 184 
I believe and still lost a good third or more of my combines.
