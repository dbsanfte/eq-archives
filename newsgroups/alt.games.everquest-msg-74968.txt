Yeah, it's unheard of for a programmer to not fully understand
the implications of his implementation.   That's NEVER happened,
not once, in the history of programming.

I'm not saying that's the case here but there's ample proof that
VI's technical staff -- programming and development -- have failed
to fully understand their implementation repeatedly.  Take the
Amulet of the Haven, a faction-boost necklace intended to give
faction only within Shadow Haven.   When released it improved
the wearer's standing with all factions.   That's a pretty simple
implementation:   "if (amulet-equipped) then faction01 += 100,"
yet they got that wrong.

The well-known saying "That's not a bug, that's a feature" has
plenty of truth when applied to EQ.  There's no reason to believe
the tracking implementation is any different.
