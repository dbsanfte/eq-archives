My first character on EQ was a warrior.  I got him up to 45, then made a
Necro because I couldn't seem to be effective with the warrior.  My
problem is this: I'm grouped in the Dreadlands with other melees and ALL
of them (I'm talking Rangers, Paladins, Monks) seem to be able to
draw the mob's aggro better than I can -- and do more damage than I can.  My
taunt is 200.

I believe my problem is that I'm severely under-equipped (at least
compared to other characters that have been uber-twinked).  I've still
got the crafted armor I got from those quests (spent so long I hate to
give it up).  My primary is an Icetooth Claw and my secondary is a
Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies.

I've got two questions:

1. What equipment do others with warriors recommend I should have at
level 45 (weapons and/or armor)?

2. What is the relationship between the damage that a weapon's
description says it can do (11 in the case of my Claw) and the damage
that I actually do with it (sometimes hitting for 40 or so, albeit
rarely).

Thanks.
