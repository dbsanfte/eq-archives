 Better stop where you are you stupid fuck, I lost a long time friend this
week in the WTC and I don't need a little shit like you on my back.  Read
the original post with your head out of your ass and stop picking lines to
comment.  You are probably the first to whine when EverQuest doesn't work.
And I said keep making the same mistakes because it happened before to
someone else I know.  Unlike you I don't post remarks just to type!

It took nearly two hours and several calls to Verant and my credit card
company to straighten this problem out.  I have every right to be upset.  If
you don't agreed I don't care, it wasn't a post to divide the masses against
Verant and overthrow them.

I've had enough this week.  Back off before you meet someone that breaks it
off!

  Last post!!!! F.O.
