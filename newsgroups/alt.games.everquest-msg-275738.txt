I hadn't seen this posted yet.

On March 22, 2005, we will begin the process of merging some of the
EverQuest servers.  As we have seen from the recent success of the Zek
merger, combining some of the EQ worlds is beneficial for playersï¿½
experience.  In fact, we have been pleasantly surprised to find that
the new Zek server now has a higher population than the four combined
servers had prior to that merger.  We hope that by merging some of our
lower population servers with a higher population server, we will
continue to enhance your gameplay experience

Merging Servers

On March 22nd, Antonius Bayle will merge with Kane Bayle and will
retain the name Antonius Bayle. 

On March 23rd, Bristlebane will merge with Solusek Ro and will retain
the name Bristlebane.
