Well! I don't know about you but if a business software was released with
features that did not work and I had to update every couple of weeks so that
they would work AND even when I updated more bugs were introduced I would be
one ticked off consumer. Last time I checked this game is a business that US
the consumers use.

I get the impression at times that Verant is the proverbial 2 headed dog but
with more than 100 heads. All going in different directions and not looking
or caring what the others are doing. It is either that or they do not know
what they are totally doing at all and I refuse to believe that. =)

I would prefer they spend resources to fix a few things all they way instead
of fixing all things a little at a time.

Oh and as far as playing EQ 24/7. That is for the independently wealthy that
do not have to work or have a family to take care of. A large majority have
limited playing time a month much less a day.


Example
My employer gives me 2 days off a week and one of those days is Wednesday.
The other day off is Sunday when my family is home also so I spend the time
with my family. So the time I get to play is reduced not by 3% but 25% a
month. If they patch twice a month then 50%. Now that is here in the states.
What about the other world players that the only time they get to play is
during the hours that patching occurs?
