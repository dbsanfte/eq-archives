If you are thinking of going into tradeskills in order to make a profit,
then you may as well just forget about it now.  As a shaman I get Alchemy,
this is a skill that has made me a profit.  I have also taken up smithing, I
am still in the hole on this skill, I have trained it up into the 140s.  I
took up baking, it's cheap and easy to do, and is required for the shawl
quests.  I took up tailoring, still in the 40s with that, it's a royal pain
in the butt, as you need to kill low level mobs for the ingredients for it.
I will need to take up pottery and jewelcraft and fletching for the shawl
quests, I would not bother otherwise with my shaman.  If you want to take up
tradeskills as an added dimension to the game, then by all means, do it, but
from a moneymaking perspective, it's just not worth it, you'd be far better
off, going out, hunting, looting and leveling.
