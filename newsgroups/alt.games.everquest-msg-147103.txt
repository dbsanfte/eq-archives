Bugged?  How so?  They smoothed the level progression from 51 thru 60
by fiddling with XP awards.  This means that levels 52, 53, & 55-60
will receive smaller XP awards, while levels 51, 54, and 59 (the last
of the so-called hell levels) will receive larger XP awards.  I'd like
to see a lot more information than some vague whine that "XP is only at
75% pre xp patch" without any details.  If all they've done is check
L60 xp then they're not telling us anything VI didn't already.

Kaev <--- who fully realizes that VI may well have blown it again
