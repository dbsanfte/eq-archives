The problem with the "Ten Commandments in the courtroom" bit is
two-fold.  First there <is> an explicitly religious commandment:
"I am the Lord your God...", and second there is no way any
reasonable person is going to interpret their presence as other
than a religious statement.  Yes, it's true that they form an
important part of the historical foundation of our law, but that
doesn't make it okay for an official agent of the government to
display them in his official capacity, where he is required to
follow and interpret laws that are themselves restricted by the
Constitutional prohibition on laws regarding the establishment
of religion.  How in hell could any person who follows a
religious tradition other than Christianity or Judaism hope
to receive a fair trial in an environment where the <judge>
has, in effect, declared that <his> religion takes precedence
over the laws of the land in his courtroom?

As for free speech, he's welcome to proclaim the decalogue in
his home, in his church, in his golf club, on a soapbox in the
park, & etc.  It's not like this is the first or only limitation
placed upon "free speech" (try threatening the president or
shouting fire in a crowded theatre, to pick a couple other
extreme examples).
