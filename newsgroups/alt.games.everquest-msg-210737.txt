    BOOOOOOOO! So now they have melee rebalancing, more than a few zone
revamps, the shared plat slot, and new text filters on their "soon" list.
We'll need a whole "soon" patch just to get them caught up!

    Never went to the Chardok one, but I'm going here. Always loved Sol B!

    Too bad these summoned items are of almost no use to the mage. They have
what, one DoT line consisting of two spells that are never used?

    Yay! Between the two mage changes, hopefully the "summon us crap" load
will stay the same as it is now.

    Ok. Now that they've fixed this, is there an ETA for fixing the related
problem of breaking down ore? According to the messages party members get
when you split blocks and large bricks, we should be getting two of the
appropriate product (large bricks and small bricks). But it hasn't worked
right due to cursor stacking issues since it was first introduced. If they
can fix the stacking issues for Mass Enchant spells, can they fix the
tradeskill issue?

    Are they going to do anything with Illusion: Froglok, or will it
continue to be the booby prize for turning in a Rune for a level 65 spell?

    Now THIS is a useful spell. I wonder how it will be obtained? Originally
it was assumed it would be the result of the Sage quests in PoK.

    Dennis can finally be happy. ;-)

    "Error", in this case, means that some of them weren't dropping. I'd
love to know exactly what is involved with moving drop tables over to the
Live servers that it gets screwed up all the time. I mean, they do test to
see if they're working on Test, right?

    Ok, so all the complaints about having to do the first wave over and
over were listened to. But question: what will happen on servers where
multiple guilds are in Time (and there's several, Tunare has three guilds
there)? Will the next raid to enter the zone be moved up to the progress
point of the last raid in zone?

    Hoho, they did nuke the ZEM! I wonder which quests were not restored to
their former XP....

    Woo-hoo! That was really beginning to get annoying.
