Bwahaha.

My main (druid) is named Aidann Abetton on Drinal. I figured that was 
subtle enough to get bye, and feels druid-y to boot. I thought of 
"Anabetton" but decided it sounded too girly (and with the new male wood 
elf models, Aidann needs all the testosterone he can get... Even the male 
druids get camel toes!)

My alt (monk) has a real persons last name in tribute. He is Wasain 
Kurasawa. I hope noone feels the urge to clue Verant in on samurai flicks 
:)

Bixy has yet to choose her last name. I was thinking Boxy, but I am as-of-
yet unsure. I still might choose Stinger :)
