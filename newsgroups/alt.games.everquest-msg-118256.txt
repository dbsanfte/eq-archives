Then quit arguing and go away.

>2nd.  Where does it say that I can't pay someone to help me get an item?

You can't pay someone for an item. "Paying for help getting the item"
is just a bullshit attempt at loopholing and doesn't fly any farther
than "I'm only buying your time".

>3rd.  Where does it say that I can't trade for an item?

It doesn't. But no one in their right mind is going to trade Cobalt
armor, Cloak of Flames, 10kpp, etc for batwings, snake fangs, etc.

>4th.  Then how am I breaking the EULA.

See above.
