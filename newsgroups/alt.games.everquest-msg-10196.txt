Well, as I understand it, the police can post false rewards and
contests like that, as part of sting operations, but in some states
(not all), if you bid in an auction, it's the same as signing a
binding contract.  So, if you get a better deal elsewhere, the seller
can, in fact, push it in court to get you to pay.

The point about cancelling the account, however, is a good one  :)
