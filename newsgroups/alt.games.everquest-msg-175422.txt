My 2HB is around zero.  1HB is 20ish, I did use one for a short while.
Piercing is getting close to maxxed.  The problem, particularly with 2HB is
that 2HB weapons are usually slow, so it takes longer to get skill
increases.  Wielding a 2HB weapon also means that you can't hold some nifty
item in your off hand with nice stats to complement your one hand weapon
with nice stats.
