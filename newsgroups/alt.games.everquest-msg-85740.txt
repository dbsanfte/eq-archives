I screwed up.  I was on the 3rd leg of the continuing quest for the sonic
wolf bane weapon.  I play a bard.  I had gotten my CLOAK OF THE JHARIN
APPRENTICE and was tasked with retrieving 2 sonic wolf jawbones which I was
still several levels too low to get (TPW).  So eventually I scavenged them
off others kills.  But by that time I had forgotten who I was to give them
to.  Maybe I lost the notes, or maybe I just figured I could always go look
it up on Alakhazams.  But no spoiler sites seem to have anything past the
first leg of the quest.  So I turned it in to the one I thought most likely
wanted it and damn if he didn't eat it.  So does anyone know what I have to
do to restart the current leg, or is there any place I could look this quest
up?
