See below but I think it has to do with the low Meditate level a
lowbie generally has.  That effects the mana per tick, and since the
OOC rate is more a "fast forward", that makes sense.

Well as long as I've had a necro the Lich line of spells overwrites
the Clarity line.  Good thing too, because they are generally much
better at comparative levels.

I've noticed my regen rate is positively effected with enhancing
buffs.  I look at the OOC rates as a way of "fast forwarding" an
already enhanced rate.  So a no buff guy should go up slower than a
buffed rate.  At least that is what I noticed, but have never really
timed it.  Frankly its plenty fast for me now.  Not like the OLD
DAYS!!!

No expert here, but that's what I see.
