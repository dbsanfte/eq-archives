I think the X amount of exp needed to get from 1 to 60 will stay the same.
But instead of a colored bar moving reallly really slowly at hell levels it
will go faster from 1 to 10, then more smoothly from 11 to 60. The X staying
the same seems to be the reason no exp bonus for characters past hell
levels.

We'll see. What's your theory ?
