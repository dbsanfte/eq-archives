Well since someone is asking I would also like a few ideas aswell.  I have a
woodelf Rogue, that goes by the name of Rhinvan.  I could only come up with
one surname "quickhands"  I don't know if that goes in the lines of
"meesatank" (mees-a-tank) or things like that, and do not want to have a
surname like that.  So let me know your ideas.  Thanks for the help
guys/gals!

Brandon
