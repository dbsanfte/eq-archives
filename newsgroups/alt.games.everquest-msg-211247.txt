Oddly enough, I would have put it just the opposite. The only people who
don't have a problem are the ones who intentionally ignore the message.
It's the people who actually pay attention to the con messages that get
reamed by them.

Thought experiment: If all con messages said "what do you want on your
tombstone?", regardless of your level or mob level, would you consider
them more accurate or less accurate? Tough call! That tells you something
about the execrable utility of the con messages... :/
