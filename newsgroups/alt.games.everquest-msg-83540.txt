Yeah, I can't think of anything I'd want most classes to say in a macro
about what they're doing.

And I hate multi-line spam.  I hate RP spam.  A long macro for INC
is...well, it's ok.  I won't bitch about that one too much.  But a 2-liner
saying things like
/g "Don't be a baby %t, it's only a scratch
/say "Remedy inc for %t

And if it fizzles a couple times you get to see *6* lines instead of just
the original ANNOYING *2* liner.

Or every fight the freakin' ranger giving us a blow-by-blow account...

Here's my macros:

"%t is MEZZED"
"%t is SLOWED"

I have one silly one, but I don't use it very often:
"Boo!!!  %t is SCARED of me!"
