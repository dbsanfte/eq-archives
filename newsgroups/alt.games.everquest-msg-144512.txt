Hi all. I haven't been on any kind of raids for months, and i'd like to have
some action. I have 2 non-guilded characters, and one in a guild whose
overall level is way above me.
Here are my toons. I hope someone would find some use for me this week-end
because i'd really like to go nuts and do a long raid with skilled people :)

Antonious Bayle:
Fizzl, 39 ranger <no guild>
Sungzung, 24 Mage <no guild>

Fennin Ro:
Amadeun, 38 Enchanter <Veturi>

Just in case you are wondering why i am not guilded on AB, the reason is
that i didn't play for 3 months and i found my guild was way ahead of me,
and most of my old buddies had joined other bigger guilds, so i quietly
removed myself.
*Puhleaaase beg,beg,beg* Take me with you in whatever raid you might have.
:)
Skills:
Fizzl - Great puller
Amadeun - Accurate growd control
Sungzung - Fucknut who doesn't know how to group and will prolly lead the
raid force in prompt wipe by losing the control of his pet :)

So, just contact me here, mail me (remove the dashes) or send a tell in game
if you feel like you would like to have me with you.
