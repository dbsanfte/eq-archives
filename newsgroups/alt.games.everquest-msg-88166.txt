It probably created a default eqclient.ini which specified a color depth of
16 instead of the 32 your file was set to.

Leave that file alone Jenn.  I *know* 32 bit color depth isn't the default
setting in eqclient.ini it's 16, you have to manually go change it 32.
There is no where else to change it except manually editing the file.

So, in summary, keep your fucking hands off that file you little hacker you.
