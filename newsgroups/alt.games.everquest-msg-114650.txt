Okay... being new and all you have alot to learn... lets see if I can shed
some light on this subject

When you level you don't Automatically get your spells... you either have to
1) Buy them
2) research them (starting at 16 or 20... can't remember)
 3) Get them off dead mobs (not sure what level your first NPC only spell
is... not for a long time tho I'm for sure)
 or 4) quest for them (Concussion is only Wiz Quested spell I know of.. and
that's 50 spell so that's not for awhile for you)

at your level you will need to buy them...

You can get a list of your spells level by level and learn what they do at
http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Wizard

not sure where you live in EQ atm but you'll need to find a Wizard guild. eq
maps can be found at http://www.eqatlas.com
this is one I prefer... find out where you are hunting... find closest town
and look for the Wizard Store if there is one and look for your spells...

at your level you will probably want to be very picky of what spells you buy
because money will probably be in very short supply for you (money for
spells is one of biggest problems for starting casters who don't have
friends to fall back on)

Once you get your spells bought and have them on your person you have to
Scribe the spells into you spell book. I'm very sure you know how to get
into your spell book so I won't tell you how to do that. to scribe your
spell you take the spell you bought, pick it up, and then drag it over an
empty spell slot in the spell book and put it in there (not sure how else to
describe it hehe)... It will then tell you 'You have begun scribing the
spell Nukem into your spell book' or somethign like that... you will notice
a bar on right slowly counting down... when it gets to end it will say 'You
have successfully scribed spell itno your spell book' and there you
have your spell

Your spell is then in your book for the rest of your EQ life... you can move
spells around by right clicking the spell in your psell book and then right
clicking where you want that spell to go (makes life easier if you keep your
book tidy heh)

Added note... while buying spells look for your wizard trainer... make sure
you train in Meditate... makes spell scribing, sitting for mana, go SO much
quicker...

and thus I'll shut up... it's late... Im tired... and as much as I'm trying
to answer your question in detail I feel I'm starting to ramble on and on
and on etc ad nausium... bleh... dam 14 hour workdays will get ya
everytime... :)

I hope yer not afraid to ask more questions... I'm scary but I try to
help... good luck... and hope this answers your questions...
