Oh, that reminds me...  A friend went LD during buffing for a
Vox raid. He couldn't get back in until the next day, at which
point the entire zone had repopped.  He didn't even know
the way out, it was his first visit to Permafrost.

So imagine popping into the PF buff hallway with the
dungeon fully populated, with no buffs, with a 47 Ranger...

I knew the area, so he asked me to "drive".  He wanted
me to at least get him to the King room before he died,
so the corpse recovery would be easier.

He hit the "enter world" point, and I took control and
got ready to run like hell.  Popped in, "hello Mr. Ice
Giant..."

RUN like a mother, with what seemed like every Ice Giant
in the dungeon on me.  Stunned, grit teeth, watch health
drop....  Unstunned, run run run...

Unbelievably, I almost made it out -- died at the top
of the little ladder just before the zone-out.  Corpse
recovery was as simple as step into the zone and loot.
