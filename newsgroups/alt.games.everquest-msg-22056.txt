This alters with your levels, the maximum difference increases as your level
gets higher. If I remember correctly it is around 5 levels, i.e. if you are
15 and the highest level in group, then the lowest that would get XP would
be 10.

At level 34, I was getting some XP grouped with mid 40's.

Hope this hopes.
