>Power Supply:	375-400 Watt (enough?)

Go namebrand on the PS 400 watt. I went thru 3 cheapo PS's that where
causing me to crash because one of the voltages varied. With 400 watt
PS I never crash now.

>Case:		Mid-tower (Are they all the same?)

Your preference

Not much difference here except price and overclockability (Am I right
here folks?)

>Memory:		768M-1G, but what kind?  

Crucial. DDR 2100 or faster 512 does great for the moment.

>Video:		GeForce4 4400/4600 as available

I went Radion 8500 series. Works for me and was much cheaper.

>Disk Drive:	80Gig or so fast IDE, SCSI not worth the cost for me

Hehe if you get certain types of motherboard, you may want two 80 gig
IDE drives to strip raid.

>DVD:		Whatever is new and fairly cheap

Don't scimp on CD or DVD unless you don't use it much. Bearings go
fast if you listen to cd's

>Sound:		No idea here, good luck with Turtle Beach in the past

Orgy or aurigy (what ever it is, sounds good if you get it to work
with no problems)


>Display:	Either existing 19", maybe a new 21", or a 17" LCD?

Ewww LCD looks good but man for the money you can get a monitor that
can handle faster refresh rates and save on the headaches (LTBHE)
length of time before head explosion
