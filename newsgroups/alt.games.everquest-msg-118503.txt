I'm in the top guild on my server by a margin. Kill AOW, Cursed, HP, AL,
Burrower etc. with regularity. I'm one of a couple of primary MTs. I'm
also an officer in that guild, with all the extra work that entails. I
have a full-time job, live with my girlfriend and her daughter in a flat
we bought together a couple of years ago, which we have completely
redecorated. I'm also on a 5 hour time difference from the majority of
the guild. I go out regularly, and have been DJing the underground goth
scene in the UK with residencies in clubs for the past 10 years.

Now you know of one. 

I don't want to join those guilds because I have one of my own and love
the people in it, but I certainly meet all the criteria other than their
being a PST guild putting them slightly further outside my reach than my
current EST based guild.

That means by definition that you are taking the easy route,
stereotyping people based upon transferring your own limitations. 

If I was immature, I'd tell you to take your unfounded insults and wedge
them up your rectum if you could find room in that uptight poo-hole of
yours with all those preconceptions. But since I'm more mature than
that, I'll refrain. [1]

I play too much EQ, I freely admit that. However it's certainly NOT the
be-all and end-all of my life. As outlined above, I have other more
important things to consider, and if/when EQ gets in the way, I simply
don't log on. I could be making model aeroplanes, I could be playing
with a giant train set, collecting stamps, or any number of things
people spend too much time on. I could simply be spending all night,
every night, down the pub watching football. Instead, I play EQ a little
too much, and get called names by ill-informed idiots like you.


[1] That was ironic sarcasm. Ask your parents, or someone with a sense
of humor before responding if you didn't understand ):oP.
