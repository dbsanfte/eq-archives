Actually, if you read the change messages that accompanied the
proposed changes that have everyone in a tizzy, Verant is claiming
that there are more people playing EQ than ever before.  I don't know
about you, but statements such as this:

"Since the launch of The Shadows of Luclin, EverQuest has attracted
many new players, giving us our largest number of subscribers ever. 

Given the sudden arrival of so many new adventurers into the world of
Norrath, which greatly exceeded our expectations, we've taken time to
enrich the EverQuest experience at lower levels."

indicate to me that Everquest is still continuing to gain more
customers than they lose.  

Now if we assume that there is any validity to your statement about
being able to make these at any time, why would they make these
changes now?  

Verant is a business, they worry about keeping customers, but they
seem to be a hell of a lot better at that than most gaming companies.
Hell, after reading how Funcom allows ebayed characters, I realize
that Verant is the shining example of how it should be done.  I just
wish the Vision still existed.  (Hold the flames, I prefer The Vision
to Monty Haul, my choice.)
