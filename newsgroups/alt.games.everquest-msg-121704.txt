Maybe the way name changes are done was changed quite a bit from when
I guided, but "the committee" at that time was "whoever the hell
happened to be on at the time."  We'd find a name that was bad, or had
one petitioned, and the guide investigating would as on the GM channel
"Hey, what do you all think of this name, bad or good?"  We'd get a
concensus, and if the name was decided to be bad (and the attending
Senior Guide/GM agreed), it would get changed... no matter what level
the character.  The only time the Lead Gm types would get involved
would be if the player escalated through email.

It didn't even take a GM to make the name changer, either.  Senior
guides had that power, and the one's on the server I worked used it
quite freely.

This information is over a year old, so I'll be the first to admit
things could be very different now.
