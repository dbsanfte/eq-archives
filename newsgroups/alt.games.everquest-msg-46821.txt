In the past I'd have said, "NO RUN." But then I realized that I am
jaded after two years but to a new person this could be a pretty fine
game. Honestly there is no better MMORPG out there, probably including
dark age of camelot. 

My suggestion would be to buy kunark. Old EQ by itself is pretty sucky
and if you liked it at all you'd buy kunark anyway so its really
cheaper just to buy kunark. Otherwise you'd be paying the 10 bucks for
old eq then buying kunark. I think kunark is only like 26 bucks now
and includes old EQ. Kunark improves on the old game A LOT in terms of
mob density and huntable areas.

To get a good feel for the game I'd then suggest starting a character
such as an iksar and going to field of bone or lake of ill omen, which
have many things to kill. Lake of ill omen also has many players but
they will mainly not be in the newb area but you can get a feel for
the game from them. The qeynos area might also be good to start in
since you can be in blackburrow soon which is really not very crowded
on an established server. Misty/rivervale as a halfling is also quite
nice.

I'd not suggest starting in freeport, its basically a very poor area
when around level 6 plus with FAR too many people trying to get orc
kills off VERY FEW spawns around small camps. That was one of the
problems with old EQ areas which is why I suggest kunark. 

Getting kunark, having the free month, being able to play at least one
iksar character also (even if you run around with a regular one too)
and getting one of those 3 month cards you mention would be a pretty
good introduction to the game. You'd have the free month or whatever
then the 3 months to check it out, plenty of time.
