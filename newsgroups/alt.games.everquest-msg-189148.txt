The Dwarven GM Smith in my guild spent oodles and oodles of time doing 
Shadowscream armor to finish up his smithing.  I'm pretty positive he did 
the last 30+ points with that armor.  It's fairly inexpensive ( according 
to him ) but horribly tedious because of the farming.

One of the ingredients ( Swirling Shadows ) used to be NO-RENT but has 
recently been changed so it hangs around after logging.  Now people are 
farming it and selling it to the smiths, of course.  Other ingredients are 
NO-DROP, so you're pretty much going to have to farm them yourself.

If you are short on cash, this is probably the way to go near then end of 
smithing.  You'll want to learn how to manipulate the "wars" in Hollowshade 
so that the mobs you want to farm are up.

>Or should I just search out a Dark Elf, GM, Smith on Bristlebane?

Every couple of hours, ask if there is a DE GM Smith on your server on 
there; you may eventually find one.  I was able to find a rogue to make 
mercury on my server using that channel.
