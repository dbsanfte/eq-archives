It really sounds like you have a bad connection.  When the system "burps"
like that and you feel like you're getting out of sync, it's because of
packet loss.

However there seems to be a post-patch bug where upon log in the game is
either twice as fast or twice as slow as it should be.  I've seen both
happen, and the resulting gameplay is completely screwy.
