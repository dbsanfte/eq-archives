Agree on the loot before you join the group.  I won (via /random) some nice
legs the other night for my 57 ranger that *were* an upgrade and I *am* wearing
them.  They were rogue/shaman/ranger only (blood covered).  There were no
rogues / shamen / rangers in my group.  *I* was the one that insisted everyone
roll.  (The cleric refused.  He said he doesn't have a bazaar mule.)
It was a pickup group, and only a slight upgrade, and I saw them for sale in
the bazaar for 2500 PP.  I didn't deserve them just because I was in the group.
(This, of course, falls under the huge *NBG* debate... it's never going to end,
is it? :)
