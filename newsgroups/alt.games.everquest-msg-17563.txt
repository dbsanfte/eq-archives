Go to the docks on the west side of the zone.  There are two docks, one to
the north of the area where the Freeport boat docks, and one to the south
where the four Firiona Vie shuttles go.  Get on a shuttle, wait around for a
while, eventually they will leave and you get on the main ship in Timorous
Deep which takes you to FV.
