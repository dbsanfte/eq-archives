Personally.. i'm not in favor of the name pointing to the fact that it
is an easier version to use.. like Lite. What I think they should do
is come up with a name that reflects the story and sell on the box as
a new game that is for the casual player with less upstart. Heck..
they did that with Lords of Everquest.

Not hard to do.. especially with what they've stated about the game.

Simply list on the box with a bullet item that this new product is
designed for casual and experienced gamers that seek to advance their
players through group play.

You want existing and former gamers to try it out.. to a lot of them
the concept of casual grouping play as the main means of progression
is quite appealing.

They're going to tout that regardless in order to show they're
competitive with other games of the MMO arena. As long as EQ2 can get
new people in the door.. quite a few of those should be able to
transition as wanted to EQ over time.

Think of it like golf. EQ is the full game... EQ2 looks to hit the
miniature golf and casual arena. If you can get people playing the
game.. even on a casual basis in EQ2... then the transition to EQ
isn't as harsh and if they go lookin.. you'll get them. At the same
time.. miniature golf from time to time appeals to the golf player
just for the fun aspects.

EQ has an advantage in that Verant/SoE has not only gone balls-out
into the raiding arena, but the base world was pretty well defined and
the expanding and filling it out over the years has been pretty
decently done. Do they have issues with bugs and buggy code and what
not? Sure. Is the game the ideal version of what every fantasy-lover
thinks the world should be? Nope.. but you'll never not only meet
that.. everyone's idea will be different.

But no game is gonna touch the sheer complexity of EQ for some time to
come. And i include WoW in that. I laugh at the fact Afterlife moved
to WoW. Can they do all the quests they want with tons of single-group
content and the like? Sure, and while fun, I suppose Phil Mickelson
could play on the Amateur Circuit. But Blizzard has a lot of miles to
go to ever get the complexity of a raid-level enviornment and the
balancing issues that entails, and I seriously doubt they'll even try
for some time to come.

Yeah.. and they're going to have to start addressing their pricing
system pretty quick. Lets see...

Evolution : $20
LDON : $30 (i think this is still $30)
GoD : $20
Omens of War : $30

So you're talking $100 to get up and running. What i'd like to see is
Evolution + LDoN for $30 and GoD + OOW for another $30. One-month
comes in Evolution so you are paying like $47 total. Then you can
actually be competitive with other games having all your expansions
plus the original out for the cost of a normal game. $100 is obscene.

Hey.. it takes two to tango here. Sure the item data inflates with new
content... but players aren't exactly looking to start over. They're
hitting the highest content they can and advancing themselves as fast
as they can. Personally.. i kind of like the idea that old zones
become push-overs... because it gives the player a reason to play them
again... to just mow through them with reckless abandon on an off
night when everything else is down.

That's the other thing that I like.. old zones tend to be uncrowded,
mobs tend to be up for the casual player. Just before I left you could
find both NToV and WToV up a lot of the time(full spawn) and just get
some friends together and kill old school dragons for fun. Log on a
couple alts to get the loot. Because there is truly so much raiding
content to go around, and most isn't tied to high-end guild
progression.. more and more stuff.. even in the PoP planes is gonna be
available to pretty much any guild that wants to take the trouble to
get it. It used to be most of the raiding content was perma-down or
allready droppin, soon it'll be... you just aint tryin.

If anything... SoE really learned a new expansion can't just focus on
the high-end. The expansion actually has to have new stuff for not
only them but time, elemental, tier 1-3, and old world guilds. And
real xp areas for each, while they can inhabit the same zone. You give
each level of guild and set of players a reason to 'buy in' as you
say.

You still can't dictate how the users play the game. Casual users
thrive off droppable items.. if they want to do the Sol Ro class
quests... they do still work, but if not they can buy with plat the
quality droppable item that helps them out more. The beauty is that
there is more than one progression path.. there are many. The way you
play it this time will be completely different then the way you play
it next, and often not even the same content.

A fair assessment. But part of the reason they didn't is an attempt to
keep an expansion its own entity with its own storyline. If you start
introducing an upgrade to say the Coldain Rings say #'s 11-15, into
PoP... how exactly does that play? Why oh why would Dain Frostreaver
suddenly allow planes to have upgrades to his rings? You start to
stretch believability unless you make up a whole lotta lore to gloss
it over with.

It is happening for OOW btw. Epic 1.5 for regular players.. 2.0 for
the top end.

Yeah... they should provide at least tribute at the Tribute Master for
it. Say something like 100 tribute per NO DROP item. Nothing really
big to prevent tribute farming.. just a bone.

I wouldn't see that point.

Not to mention people wouldn't see the point of not only starting
over.. but not being able to access bazaar gear.

No.. they really aren't. This is a misconception :>. There are way too
many other ways of making much more money with a lot less effort these
days. They are fun to kill, give somewhat decent money, and a good
time killer for a lot of people... so people tend to still do them.

And some pay more :>.

3 expansions for the high-end player, sure. For a guild coming up...
they utilitize a good 6 of those expansions with GoD the lone
exception. Even LoY has some good loot-droppers if you know where to
look. Nothing mind-blowing.. just up-and-coming guild stuff.
