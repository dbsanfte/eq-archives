"That's because Ralph and I speak the same language," Joshua said, oozing ba
ck towards the shore with Ralph.
"Hello, Leigh," I said, shaking her hand. "It's pleasure to meet you. Excuse
 me for just one second, please." I turned, leaned over the desk, and sucker
-punched Ben in the nose. I turned back to Leigh, who sat, stunned, watching
 as Ben yodeled in pain at his desk, holding his bleeding nose in his splaye
d fingers. I sat on the edge of Ben's desk and smiled winningly.
"You're mocking me, aren't you," Joshua said.
"Tom?" Marcella looked over to us. "Carl will see you now." She crinkled a s
mile and wiggled her fingers at Joshua. Joshua surged, as if to make a beeli
ne for her lap. I held him by his collar and dragged him into Carl's office.
 Carl was at his desk, glancing at a Hollywood Reporter. He set it down as I
 closed the door.
