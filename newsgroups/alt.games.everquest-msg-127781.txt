    The issue is getting a mage to that many AA points. Once they're there
they solo like champs, but in the meantime unless they have epic pet they're
not exactly blowing through XP quickly. Unless there aren't enough wizards
for an AoE group and they get lucky. ;-)

    More, if he eats his own rods every so often while a cleric heals him.
That's our mana setup on raids - a "mod factory" consisting of our mages, a
cleric, and depending on the raid a necromancer/shaman/bard. They churn out
rods like nuts. We did Cursed cycle last night - 20-30 minute fight, I was
on a ten second CH rotation with one other cleric on one tank the entire
fight (I cast CH, when mine lands other cleric starts casting, etc.) I never
went beneath 70m, I don't believe any of the other clerics went beneath 50m,
and at the end the ground was still covered in rods.

    Nope, you take yourself out of the healing loop if you Rod then CH
yourself. In XP groups, this is viable (or in downtime situations in
general), but not during a big fight. We get around this by having a shaman
in every CH group, casting Torpor on clerics as they mod. As long as the mob
doesn't warp into the place where the clerics are (eeek!), this can be kept
up pretty much as long as required.

    I'm at 4300 HPs or so with raid buffs, and I'm a HP whore. Some of the
best equipped clerics in the game have maybe 500 more HPs than I do, so 5 K
is more a pipe dream. Remember, we don't have Focus on us - we have our
self-buff 6 mana/tick buff up. That's between one and two hundred HPs lost
compared to the mage. And no way in hell am I trying to set up a
Khura's/Marzin/PotG buff setup when I have to group Aego stragglers that
miss AoE Aegolism.

> Personally I think they'll have to do something about it.

    They have. High-end encounters are tuned to that level of mana
consumption. Disgusting, but true. Our first serious attempt at the Emperor
is today, and we'll have *14* clerics for our projected healing setup.
That's not counting the mana consumption of our wizards, who (near the start
of every fight) Manaburn the mob then rod up.

    The Arch Lich before last, we had a cleric and a mage being played by
one person. The cleric was the mod group cleric, so he knew exactly when to
press the "CH" button and go back to churning rods.
