Things are 'some' things that made me stop and stare the first time I saw them:
(note you can make new newbie characters to explore different
zones, where your main character is KoS)

The dancing skeletons in Paineel.

The tall pines in Surefall Glade.

The flying saucer Temple of Life in Qeynos.

Giant statue in Everfrost.

The frozen King in Permafrost.

The Spectre pets in the Qeynos Aqueducts in the SK and necro guild.
(never saw a spectre up close without it pounding my skull into my kneecap)

Wooden chain bridge between East and North Karana.

Waterfall in East Karana, Its in the Southeast corner.

Glowing skulls in Befallen.

The glowing neon effects in Neriak. Looks like a twisted Disneyland.
Also, the Halfling leatherfoot deputy swimming outside the blind fish
tavern window.

The Large Carvings in the walls of the Ramp to Highpass in East Karana.

The Lush Apartments and the Gambling hall of Highpass Keep.

The Efreeti in the Temple of Sol Ro.

The Sphinx in the Rathe Mountains.

The Temple/tower in the underwater cave in Lake Rathe.
The Flame tower is pretty cool looking in Lake Rathe.

Entrance to Kaladim.

Full spawn chess board in Butcherblock.

Entrance to Felwithe.

Windmills in Steamfont, middle of the zone.

The clockwork gnomes in Ak'Anon, even the King is a clockwork.

The ships that travel to Kunark and Velious are awesome looking.
The Maiden's Voyage and the IceBreaker.

Kunark:

The Ancient Combine City in the dreadlands.

If Gorenaire is up in the Dreadlands and you have decent faction
with RingOfScale then you can get a picture up close of
a dragon.

The Huge Statue of Firiona Vie in FV itself. =)

Any of the huge Iksar statues in many zones, FV, FM, OT etc.

The Grand Staircase in the Emerald Jungle.

The mines in Nurga.

Meteor Crater in burning woods.

Froglok Villiage in the Swamp of No Hope.

Velious:

The Tower of Frozen Shadow.

The Dragon Bridge between Iceclad and East Waste.

The statue of the Sleeper in East Wastes.

The Central Chasm in the Crystal Caverns.

The Glowing river and waterfall in the Great Divide.

If Woushi up in the Wakening Lands and you have decent faction
with ClawsOfVeeshan then you can get a picture up close of
a dragon.

LOTS of sights to see inside Skyshrine if you have decent
ClawsOfVeeshan faction. That place is HUGE! Easy to get
lost in there. Maps for that place are 6-7 pages.


Many many more sights I am sure there is to see, I have been
playing a while and I am still amazed at the number of zones
and places I have not seen yet. Get maps.
