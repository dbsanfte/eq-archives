Yet another hopeless flamer proves my point.  And that point is
Warriors do not always have the most HP's which everyone likes to
believe.  Someone said Warriors get 6 HP's per STA at level 60.  My
friends 54 SK gets 6.5 HP's per STA.  How you like them apples?

The reason I was using such drastic STA differences was to point out
the extreme amount of HP differences that a Large race can have. 
Anyway take a Elf Warrior and Jack his STA to 100 which is Max and
take a Ogre SK and add nothing to stamina to make it 127.  The SK
still will have more HP's, just not a whole lot more.  I was using the
extreme STA differences to point out the fact that a SK can have not
just more, but a dramatic amount of HP's more.  But you and your dense
fellow flamers fail to realize anything other than apples and oranges.
 Go read a book and learn something moron.  Anyway, in the second case
which I had to bring up thanks to the flames, the SK will only have
slighty more than the Warrior.  I think your the dense one, and now
noone can say that Warriors have the most HP's anymore.

The idiotic flamers have proved it, Small race warriors cannot compete
with Large race SK's for HP's.
