   You're welcome all.  I'm hoping that doing this will help us all to
connect better when we do play.  I know that the times I've grouped with
other agers, both in Everquest and CoH, were some of the best experiences
I've had playing.  

   I'm hoping that maybe the forum will take off.  I can understand why Biz
and others are getting annoyed at all the CoH talk that has been going on
around here.  Yet, I can also understand why the CoH agers would want to
discuss it here.  I hope this works out as a reasonable compromise.

   I think that we do have enough players on Protector to do a Supergroup. 
The forums would be a good place to discuss things such as do we really
want to do this, leadership issues, and so on.
