This also does no make us more "useful" in groups. This is a downtime
ehancing utility spell. For my 55 druid the nexus ports are a positive
BOON.

Just yesterday, for instance, we had a raid in umbral plains. For the
first time I did not port anyone at all for a raid but instead I just
ran there myself. I had plenty of time to relax before the raid and do
other things instead of having to WORK so that other people were
there.

The nexus ports are a "you are without excuse" for everyone who can't
port. 
"Hey can you port me from NK to the dreadlands?"

"Nope, use the nexus portal system which is designed for that exact
purpose!"

"I don't have luclin though!"

"That is not my fault, so I refuse to be the one punished."
