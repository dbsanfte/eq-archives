Blessed?

I think not. 

Your business sense is somewhat flawed, friend.  See below.

I have no exact numbers, but the subscription base is rumoured to be in the mid
300's to low 400's of thousands.

While I've been very lucky that I have not had serious problems with the
patches that VI has released - lately it has started to go more downhill for
me.  I'm having more connection issues than I used to have, go LD far more, etc
(yes I know, I'm *SURE* it's my end).

But I degress.

If there are 300,000 users paying 9.95 a month to play EQ that is $2,985,000
cash flow PER MONTH.  Almost 3 million folks.

Hell, look at it this way.  Worse case scenario 100,000 users at 9.95 a month
is still $995,000.

That's a lot of money.

If you can't buy ample bandwidth, and necessary servers for this price, then
you have serious business development problems.

I can't belive that salaries, utilities, insurance, and housing costs result in
a figure this large.

This of course also does not take into consideration lines of credit, etc that
banks have offered VI.

Part of VIs problem lies in the fact that they really have no customer service.
 It's almost like they don't care.

I hate to keep pounding on the issue, but this game worked GREAT until
DirectX8.1 was utilizied.  It wasn't perfect, but it was far faster, and far
more stable.

Check out the EQ message boards.  ATI users in there are litterally BEGGING for
a solution so they can play.  I can't understand how a company can ignore a
userbase this long.  If you release a product, and say a configuration is
supported, support it.

DirectX is not a difficult API to program, and I've never seen another DX
application produce the same amount of problems that EQ does.

This bug has apparently be somewhat fixed on the test server, but it took
MONTHS to figure out.  

I'm not saying programming cannot have bugs, but when you have such
debilitating ones as graphical glitches that prevent users from playing, those
bugs should be top priority.

Gnome sitting positions, quite honestly, are pretty low priority.

I would love to sit in on one of the VI strategy meetings just to find out the
methodology they use to figure out which bugs they will squish next.

I would have a lot less negative feelings towards VI if they were just up front
on issues.  I don't expect them to be perfect, but inform us what is going on. 
You'll always have your whinners, but people who want straight up answers
deserve them.

Just my 2cp
