It seems to be more of a do as I teach than as I do kind of situation.
I even heard of a player with a made up name getting it changed
by a gm because it was the name of an EXTREMELY obscure
real life historical figure that the player (and about everyone
else in the thread about it) had never heard of. Verant is kinda anal
on one hand but then on the other you see a 56 level person with
the name Neecro Filyac  or something which you know has
been petitioned at least a few times, wonder what GM they are
sleeping with.
