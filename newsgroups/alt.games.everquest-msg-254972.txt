Well I've done hundreds of LDON's and only quit one.
It was a similar situation to yours.  Waited at least 30 min for the final
two ppl to arrive although I had 2 from guild ready to join us.
Group leader chose a hard mission without consulting.  We zoned in. I could
see 4 mobs from zone-in point.  As we had no chanter, I piped up that I
could see 4 and advised I could pacify if needed.  It was then offhandedly
mentioned by the MT that he was 3 boxing the 3 ppl that were in the group
when I joined up.  Puller (who was one of the 3box)  proceeded to shoot the
first mob he could see within about 10 seconds of him zoning in and trained
6 mobs on us. (remember this is a hard)  We proceeded to wipe. I gave it a
good fight though.  Used DA,DB,Div Arb,Cel Regen, all the while keeping us
alive. Finally we fell.  While running back the 3box person proceeded to
abuse the rest of the group for not pulling it together!!
Needless to say I apologised to the other two people in group and told them
that this wasn't going to work as he'd chosen a hard without consulting, was
3 boxing, and doesn't listen to advice.  Zoned back in and started looting /
rezzing and saw one of the 3 box peeps run off.  Quickly selected my bestow
divine Aura hotkey page and kept an eye out.  Yup you guessed it, the 3 box
person had deliberately pulled a train on me because I mentioned I was
bailing.  Thankfully I was ready for it and BDA'd myself, finished looting
and zoned.  Needless to say after 65 levels and a hundred odd AA's I've
finally created the NEVER EVER BUFF OR REZ list that I swore I would never
create.  Still have the bad taste in my mouth.  The next day in PoK I got
tells from the 3 boxer saying thanks very much he now has a FAIL in his LDON
leaderboard!! He's on /ignore now too....
