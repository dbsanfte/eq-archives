You should be looking to get every spot banded if it doesn't have chain on
it already.  after that, your best bet is to buy better pieces in your EQ
market or get them from drops.  You also want to level up as fast as
possible, as that has a great affect on what your potential earnings are.

you also want to start looking into buying and selling as soon as possible.
Look where you could buy something low and sell high.   This also could help
you improve your equipment fast.

Your equipment is hugely important for tanks, as it determines how effective
you are on the front line.  My druid twink was a great example of this.
With a few people who were missing equipment, I could easily hold the front
line against 3 or 4 critters without even worrying about it, and could also
heal the others "newbs" around me so when I was there no one else dying.

My druid reached 14, WOOT.  SOW!!
