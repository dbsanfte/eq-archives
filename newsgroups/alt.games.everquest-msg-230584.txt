Yes, bards rave about it, not having played a bard it doesnt excite me so
much, but can still see why it is a great item :p

As said (erm, I think I did somewhere) the list was done based (and in
order) of usefullness in a raid.

That is why the mage epic is there (instant pet after fight, although not
hugely useful really, hence why it is near the bottom). Shaman / druid epics
no much use on a raid, either (same for ranger's earthcaller, beastlords 55%
slow proc epic).
