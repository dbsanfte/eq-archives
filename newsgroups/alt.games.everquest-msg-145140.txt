If it is COV faction you want, look for Kael raids.  The faction hits are
*WAY* bigger than you get from killing the giants you can kill solo or with
a partner for XP.  What would take 500 of the outdoor XP giants will take
one or maybe two evenings of raiding.

You don't want to raid with a guild that would take you just on the basis of
your post here.  Here's how you find a guild.  First, start grouping with
people who are in guilds.  If any of the people you meet this way are
interesting people and good players, look for opportunities to group with
them some more, and with others in their guild.  If they seem to be a good
guild that you'd like, find out from them how one joins, and also find their
public message boards or web site, and take a look.

Also, find out if there is a message board for your server, and see if there
is a place there where guilds announce public raids.  Many guilds are
willing to take guests on raids.  Go on some raids, and get to know the
people and the guilds.
