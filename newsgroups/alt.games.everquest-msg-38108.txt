Not really, there was room for AO and EQ if AO did not turn out to be
such a horrible joke (at least so far)

DAOC, however, is so very similar to EQ in so many ways that few
people would probably play both. Maybe you'd play your high level god
in EQ and just not play your twinks anymore, deciding instead to spend
that time playing DAOC, but they are really probably so similar that
you will end up picking one or the other. You don't go out with one
girlfriend who is really mediocre and troublesome then start up with a
new one who is really more what you want and still go out with the old
one, it becomes too much of a difference in quality.

Who? Joke, ehehehhe. God.. I remember those days that
was so long ago. There was some local computer amiga store
and I was going "wow this is such a great new computer with GRAPHICS!"

UT and quake are one time purchase games though, a person can buy 
both and play both. They are also very small time investment games,
you get on and play death match for an hour and its enough.

Not really, it has one winning formula actually:

Nothing else is better.

That is it. That is Verant's bread and butter. As long as other
companies talk it up so big, all the improvements they have over the
current MMORPGS (such as EQ) then they release a pile of crud like AO,
Verant will still be a huge success. People are not going to play EQ
and some other MMORPG if the new one is better, in fact many won't
continue playing EQ even if the new one is EQUAL or better. 
Games that are really crappy to many of the players such as AO or AC
are not going to make a very large difference. 

I think you can really judge how good a game is by its number of
fanboys and EQ's is in serious decline (if it ever even had that many)
AO seems to have more people of a fanboy nature than EQ has. Unlike
AO, I think by now no one is really saying that EQ will "get better,
wait and see it will get better yeah... when they add this oh yeah it
will get much better (rocks back and forth in chair, drooling) oh yeah
come the fall sure, much better..."
