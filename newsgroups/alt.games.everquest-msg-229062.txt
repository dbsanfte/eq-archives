You should have been playing Star Wars: Galaxies.

The patching process in EQ is near to being silky, flawless perfection 
in comparison.

*shudder*

And I don't just mean during beta. Right up until I finally tore out my 
hair and deleted my account, they were doing daily patches which, one in 
ten times, would break the game to the point where you couldn't even log 
in for up to two days.

A lot of the apologists liked to crow about how SWG was going to be the 
vastly superior product because SOE had learned from their previous 
experiences with EQ.  If they learned anything, it was how to fuck shit 
up faster, better, and cheaper.
