I've actually an issue with the voices, but it's not what you'd think.
Sony has explicitly said that, while role playing is obviously OK,
role playing an evil character is NOT okay. There were various
incidents of people's "feelings" getting hurt because a dark elf was
"mean" to them, and Sony said "stop it".

So what do they do? Implament voices where the evil races are, well,
EVIL.

Anyone else see the hypocracy here?
