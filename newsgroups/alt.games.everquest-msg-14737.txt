 A friend of mine that I have played with for over a year changed her
password for some reason one day and soon after went to bed. The next 
day she went to log on and blanked on the password she changed to. No
problem she thought, she'll just call customer service and get the 
password. They wanted the account key off her CD. She could not find
it. They will not give her the password without the account key. She's
been trying for about a month now without success. Her account and her
level 52 Warrior she's been working on for a year and a half are now
history. Just because she lost the CD cover with the account key on it.
 
 After a year and a half, I cannot find my original CD with the account
key on it either. I am scared as hell that something will happen now 
and I will lose my level 52 Wiz.
 
 Verant is absolutely out of line with this crap policy to rely on
something as easily lost as the damned CD case with a small strip of
paper on it. I mean come on... there HAS to be a better way to verify
that you actually are the owner of an account. It's ludicrous to rely
on that number as the sole way to verify.
 
 She is concidering a class action lawsuit to force Verant to deal with
this problem in a better way. There are so many easier, more reliable
ways. Why won't Verant implement them when so much is at stake?
