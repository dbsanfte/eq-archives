Actually i thought that was part of the whole point. It ties market value to
a plat amount that is tied to each individual item. Item of quality A will
always be worth A points no matter how many or few there are of them.

Say this server has far too few paladins or sks.

And maybe this server has an uber guild that way overcamps a certain zone.

All of these problems will be smoothed over by removing the excess items via
tribute. Was a fascinating way to handle the problem and will quickly result
in a floor price for all items. Has already removed most of the really cheap
ldon excess items while not being unbalancing.
