My guess would be that it's because most other classes have a pretty
clear cut answer to that question. I don't read all (or even most) of
the class boards but of the ones I do read, the crucible seems to be
the only one where 'play what looks coolest' is the standard answer. 

... the powergamers can't handle the fact that it really is a pretty
meaningless question in regards to shaman <g>. 

There's also the fact that shaman is the new twink flavor of the month
(probably less so now with LDoN) so a lot of people are starting
shaman. 

Rgds, Frank
