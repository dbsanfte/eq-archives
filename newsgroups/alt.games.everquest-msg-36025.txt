Experience loss is mind boggingly huge now. The thing is you may have
not experienced the game at level 55 so might not know this. The loss
is a moderately slow curve until after level 50 then BOOM, big drop.

The problem is that verant has balanced the entire rest of the game as
far as aggros and all that junk and the amount you die to the current
xp loss scheme. This means that if they made the penalties LARGER most
people would frankly quit, or play twinks. It would just flat out not
be worth playing. The current system is more than hard enough.

Exactly, well here is some good news for you, when you get higher
level you suddenly won't be just saying "dang" anymore. So, lucky you,
you will get what you ask for but in SPADES. Post again when you are
level 52 and instead of saying "dang" you have inserted your keyboard
through your monitor.

My character never even bothered to get a res really before level 45,
and then only if someone was conveniently around. As you say even my
troll at level 32 just goes right on playing and makes it back soon.

At level 51 or 52 though it takes about 9 hours of continual xp to
make up for that loss probably. It gets worse after that. Basically if
you are NOT getting a 90 percent or above res at that time, it is no
longer worth playing because even off by yourself you will die at some
point.

Part of the problem in EQ with death is balance. As you have put it at
level 30 you dying is really still nothing, yet at level 45 its very
bad and at level 51 plus dying without a res becomes pretty
impossible. That is not balanced. Meanwhile, though dying without a
res at 51 you lose a HUGE amount of xp it takes you FOREVER to gain
ANY xp even killing blues to reds. The levels get insanely long while
the xp loss gets insanely large, once again that is unbalanced. I
would not mind 51 or 52 taking so much experience if when you dyed you
still lost an amount comparable to level 30 in which it takes you 2
hours to make it up as you say. Problem is you die more than high
instead of less usually.
