Been feeling a bit burned out with things lately (not just EQ) and picked up
Battlefields 1942 despite EA been the distributer. I just haven't had the
attention span lately for something as demanding as EQ and wanted to "veg
out" a bit.

I got a copy of UT2003 and it was <too> brainless, then got a hold of
Battlefields 1942 and it is a nice diversion. Not completely brainless,
though I do find myself wishing the engineers could do more. It has a couple
of fatal flaws though, ie ammo box grenade camping and no semi automatic
weapons (Where's my M1?) but it moves very fast and fluidly and is just a
lot of fun.

I would not suggest considering this game for online multiplayer unless you
have a quality broadband connection though. It is a bandwidth hog and the
free form vehicular nature of a lot of combat (especially ship bound) will
see people on poor connections bounding all over the place as their client
struggles to keep in sync...

I have a feeling in future the mod community might come good on this in the
long term. But for fellow EQ'ers it is proberly a bit too braindead for our
extended attention spans unless your suffering from thinking burnout like
moi...
