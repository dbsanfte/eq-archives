Get ready for disappointment. :-(

If you first MMORPG is reasonably good (and EQ, despite many flaws, is
reasonably good), no other MMORPG will ever really give that feeling of
newness.  The first one is special.

I think this is one of the reasons a lot of people that try other games come
back.  They are hoping to recapture that newness, don't find it, and so come
back to where they've already put in a lot of time.  E.g., most people the
"left" EQ for DAoC are back.  Most people that started with DAoC and then
"left" to try EQ came back to DAoC.  Same with AC, I think.

We'll see the same thing with SWG.  A bunch of EQ (and DAoC, and AC/AC2)
players will try it, and then be back.  I think SWG will do better than
other games have done, though, at keeping people, because there will be a
lot of people that really really want to play in the SW universe, and so
will stay.
