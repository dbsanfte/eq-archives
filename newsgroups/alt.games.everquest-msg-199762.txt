Um, no... The mage pets are better, overall.  Try to take on an fully buffed
Air pet that keeps stunning you, or an Earth pet that keeps rooting you, or
a Water/Fire pet and their nukes.

: of spells not to mention others like the fear line.

Fear does not work in duels.  Their best damage comes from their DoTs (so
it's slow compared to nukes) and in a long duel, they can pump a lot of
damage.  But keep up the various cures and make sure you are fully buffed up
with resist gear/spells and the damage has a hard time sticking.  Besides,
you can cure disease/poison as a Shaman, which are the most lethal of the
necro DoTs.

Umm, they are.  They have the best continuous mana regen in the game.  If
the have KEI on, they are fools.  It doesn't stack with Lich/Demi Lich/Arch
Lich which regens (in the case of Arch) almost 2 times the mana that KEI
does.  Oh yeah, you don't like to trade HPs for Mana.  KEI regens 18 a tick,
A L regens 35 a tick (at a cost of 53 HP).  A fully HP buffed ecro should
have around 2.5 to 3k HPs, so at 53 HPs a tick, they can keep it up for a
long time, even without the lifetaps.

You are obviously a wonderful Shaman.  What was your server?  I want to come
