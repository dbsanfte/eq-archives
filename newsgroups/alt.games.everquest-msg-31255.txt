I'm guessing that all the people that have posted like this have characters
with similar names and maybe even lost them.

Eatzabunch
Punchyourhead
and
Rugmuncha

If you lost your names, that was me.

On a plus side last time I was in Runnyeye it was pretty full (of groups of
appropriate level *GASP*) and no one had a dumb name, not even the Bard (and
I thought that was compuslory) Sort of gave me a sense of hope after sitting
in EC and seeing all the dumb names run passed.

The best are those that try to use super hero names

Spidderman
and
Supperman <-- does supper mean the same in US as it does in UK, basically
that says Dinnerman.

I get the impression that as certain people play the game more they get
jaded with the fantasy idea and make a twink with an "amusing" name as most
of the dumb names I have seen are twinks.
