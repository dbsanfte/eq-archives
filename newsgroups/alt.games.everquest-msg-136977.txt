You are correct.  His button assisted the main, then he immediately
mezzed that mob.  In other words, he was trying to mez the the mob
that the main and everyone else was beating on.

Your use of the button would work nicely.  Just be careful if the
puller is the also the main assist.  He may have one mob targetted
while he runs them to the group (whatever one he could get close to
easiest) then he might immediately switch to a different mob when he
gets them all back that is stronger or needs killing faster.  But, it
sounds like you would already have figured this out on your own.
