|You might as well define God as "that which cannot exist" then.

	Not my problem -- it's not my definition and it's not my god.

	I am a weak atheist with regard to the concept of gods in general, and a
strong atheist with regard to any god that's ever been specifically described
to me.  (Atheist #839. :-)

|I just can't conceive of any other way for the universe to exist.
|Perhaps that's just my own simple intellectual limitation at work.

	Adding god(s) doesn't help.

|I don't believe in effect without cause.

	Do we really have to go down this road?

|That means I reject a
|Godless universe where the Big Bang was the beginning of space-time.

	You are asking "why is there something rather than nothing?"  Is this the
right question?  Why *should* there be nothing rather than something?
