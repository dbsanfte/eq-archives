Interesting story about free market economics but where is the rip off ?
If people are in the market for BDs then I would think that they are
going to monitor the market a bit, not just buy at any price.
If people were really concerned about the 300pp price hike then they
would not be buying the monopolised BDs.

I assume that the reason that your Bds have not sold is that their price
is higher than the low prices (if not the monopoliser's prices).

So does that mean that you are trying to rip people off ?
Or just sell for a fair price ?

Jim
