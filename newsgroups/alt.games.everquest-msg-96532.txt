Also, reset ALL features each time. If my eyes got bugged, I'd reset
them, zone and have my hair be bugged, fix that and have my eyes be
bugged... You have to cycle through all options till you get back to
the one you want before saving your face (not necessary with the
facial features, but then again I never change those. I have to do it
with eye color, hair color and hair style every single time fiddle
with the facepick command).
