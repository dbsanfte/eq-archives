Most common suggestion for a "starter" character is a halfling druid. Good
magic throughout, decent melee early on, and halflings level faster than
other races. Gives you a chance to get used to the magic and melee aspects.
As for the magic system, wisdom casters (druids, clerics, shamans) can buy
most of their spells off merchants straight (with the exception of the
post50 spells and some of the Velious additions, which are dropped off
monsters (mobs) ). Int casters (magicians, wizards, enchanters,
necromancers) can buy a lot of their spells, there are some dropped spells,
then some spells starting level 16 have to be "researched" -- pages, runes,
or words (and other components for magicians) have to be "combined" in the
classes research tome to produce the spells. This works off the research
skill.

I haven't played AC, so I can't really say if the system is simpler or
not...
