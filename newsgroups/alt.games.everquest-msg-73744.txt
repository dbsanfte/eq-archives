I've bought about a dozen thurg armor gems from vendors for 51p each.  It's
well worth it, even if you don't have a use for one.  When I finally get my
silk robe I'll attempt to trade 5 for 1...probably go up to 8 for 1 (I have
about 24 in the bank).  For other pieces I'll probably attempt to trade 1
for 1...max 2 for 1.

I visit lots of vendors all the time.  Bought ES gaunts for 300?  Maybe 400.
Runed Falchion for about 100p (at the time it was an excellent price).
Ulthork arms for my druid, 28p.  Beats the hell out of the hassle of dealing
with EC when buying. :)
