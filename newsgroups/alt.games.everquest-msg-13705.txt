I think Verant feels that they were exploiting a pathing problem to keep
the mobs off the clerics, in addition to using CotH.  I sure hope that's
what Verant is thinking, anyway, because the idea of using CH to aggro
mobs, and using CotH to clear the aggro is clearly not an exploit, since
CH is *supposed* to aggro (in fact, Verant recently increased the amount
it aggros), and CotH is supposed to clear aggro.

It's true that these aspects of those spells are secondary aspects,
which just makes their use this way more clever.
