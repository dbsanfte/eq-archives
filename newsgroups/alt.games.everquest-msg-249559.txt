Actually since she has more than one in there only the last one is
counted, and even though its not really set up as a sig separator,
agent still reads it as such, and if I reply to her I therefore have
to snip the entire sig minus the last line.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
