I have no experience with XP, but I would not recommend Win2k for EQ.
Do not misunderstand me, Win2K is probably the most stable OS
Microsoft has ever put out and I prefer it over all others at work,
but it is not geared towards gaming/home use. It is very process
intensive and EQ graphics will lag ( more than normal :) ) and the
music/sound effects will be choppy.  I uninstalled 2k at home after a
few months of EQ and installed <gulp, getting ready for battle> WinME.
I have not regretted it at all.  Better graphics and steady
sound.......so, based on my experience, over the choices you present,
my choice would be XP Home...not 2K pro or XP pro......IMHO.
