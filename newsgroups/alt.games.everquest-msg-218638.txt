   Sorry Kaev, but I had to read this post two or three times before I
understood what you were talking about, and I know from personal
experience (say, you still play on FV anymore these days?  Let's hook up
again) that you are a competent and knowledgeable player who certainly
knows what the defining spells of a cleric are.

   That "should" was just ambiguous in your original quest, is all.  In
the first, second, and heck, third reading, I took it to mean "what
makes them" 100% effective rather than "why did the devs decided to make
them".

   Because we are holy people and the rest of you heathens suck? 
/shrug. That's probably as good an answer as you can expect to get.  I
suppose that the "correct" answer might be that in order to fix this,
SOE would have to fix it so that a low leveled cleric (or any other
healing class) healing spells would bounce off of high leveled
characters the same way that offensive spells and melee attack bounces
off of higher leveled mobs.  Heck, making healing and rez spells
"resistible" might very well liven things up.  But I think the probable
outcry from such a change would deter SOE from ever implementing this.

   Just curious.  Does anyone hope they would do this?  Serious
question, I think it would be an interesting idea.
