 In Monks defense:

 I still solo at 60. You can solo normal blues but you have to be
selective and learn which blues are harder than others.

 FD has been fixed (for the most part. It's still bugged when grouped)
so more than likely they will fall for FD as long as it's successful.

 They only reaggro when you stand up if you happen to be in aggro range
or if they are wanderers with no static spawn spot. Those are the only
two ways mobs are going to reaggro on you after a successful FD. Well
there's a small chance for statics to remember but I can't remember the
last time it's happened to me.

 My Monk is a great solo character for exploring and adventuring.
