It's a valid argument, in the sense that it places the burden of proof 
on those who believe it can be done.

I think PvP can be fairly implemented in an RPG only if character 
development is much, much more restricted than it is in EQ. Right now, a 
level 60 (hell, even a level 20) character is a *god*, compared to a 
level 1. For PvP, I'd like to see a more "realistic" character 
development in which, given equal equipment, a maximum-level character 
can be defeated by a group of no more than ten minimum-level characters, 
in pitched battle.
