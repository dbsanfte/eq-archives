Gnome skin bracers are bracelets and also no graphic (on new model; I
can see black on old model but only if she isn't wearing another
bracer with a graphic, so I gave up the whole bracer thing).

Thanks; I won't get higher than 215 on the fishing, though. Not
elemental flagged. Have 60 crumbs ready to go, need 40 more storm
salmon. Have I mentioned fishing is fun while reading linear algebra?
