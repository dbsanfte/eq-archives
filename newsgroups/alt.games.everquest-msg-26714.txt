Other than castersrealm can anyone tell me where to find some Luclin
screenshots, the ones on sony's site are like 4 months old and pretty lame,
the ones on castersrealm are nicer but they are all the same, same Vah'sir
in the same armor and the same Troll? in the same armor, I want to know what
all the other races will look like, and are there going to be more than just
tigers for the new race. SO if ya know where to find some SS's please let me
know.
