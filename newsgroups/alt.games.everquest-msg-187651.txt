From the shadows, the mysterious "Malachi" <mcfalls@exploremaine.com>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Well now's the time to learn charm kiting. Find a fat rhino, snare it
(you gotta snare it, you don't want those things charging you down
full speed when he breaks), charm it, give it druid pet buff, lay
waste to everything in sight. Make sure you do a bit of damage to your
target, it's easy to forget. Nothing major, just blast it once with
combust or even careless lightning. You're going to need that KEI
boosted mana for redoing beguile, don't waste it on doing damage
yourself. That rhino will obliterate everything he comes across. For
fun roar him into the walrus patch if there's no man-o-wars up. (if
there are man-o-wars you'll want to do them one at a time or the rhino
will get smushed).

As usual, avoid snow griffons unless you're feeling spunky. Nothing
like having charm crack and then the griffon immediately rooting you.
Even if you get the charm back, the griffon will ignore the rhino and
go straight for you, and those things chew out punishment, as if being
sowed wasn't bad enough.

Manticores aren't worth the trouble. Avoid em.

Leave snow bunnies alone too, because they're so darn cute.
