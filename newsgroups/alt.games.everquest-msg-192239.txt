Letting the PL'ee get hit is the far better way, as it allows
them to get defense raises.  Also, high level characters don't
get hit as often, and the mobs don't die as fast.

With this change I'm thinking of changing my technique -
DS PL'ee and send him in, then when the mob is well under
half send in my 61 air pet to finish it.  Hopefully this
will give the best of both worlds.
