I'm not even going to begin to comment on AnandTech's duplicity.

Ok, you want to do only 128MB boards, Chaintech (not Eagle) GF4 Ti 4200 $121
free shipping.

That's a huge price difference for a performance boost that is, in truth,
only about 20 percent.

Bang for your buck, ATI is bullshit, you pay a huge premium for the high
performance.

My MSI 64MB Ti 4200 was under 100.

If you haven't heard of MicroStar International, you don't get out much.

You certainly sound like one.

But not the price/performance crown, and their drivers suck, as they always
have, until several patches after a board is released.
