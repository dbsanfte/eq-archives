I have never heard of anyone has welcomed a high level zipping in and 
sniping their boss, even as a one off, in any game, so your comments 
that its a cultural/age/socialization thing don't hit the mark. (

Your comments have merit though, to a point. Different player groups do 
have different social conventions... but when you start interaction 
between them the accepted behaviour is that you respect others wishes 
not to be interfered with. Even if you think its ok... once you've been 
told you're not welcome, you leave, or you make an ass of yourself... 
just as in life.

At any rate, as i said, in this case: there is no age/culture/ or social 
group that thinks its ok to wander in and snipe bosses out from other 
group except the asshats doing it. (Oh, and apparently the developers 
too... but odds are they don't actually even know about the problem 
because the support team has been taught that it can't be a problem.)
