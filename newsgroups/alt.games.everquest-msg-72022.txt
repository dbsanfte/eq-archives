I don't grant forgiveness, nor am I all seeing.  I have, however, played
this game since the beginning and still play it far too much for my own good
and even in the zones I frequent as a level 60 I see that auction fairly
often, and when I happen to get to lower level zones I see it quite a bit
more often than that even.  To claim you don't see that sort of auction is
positively ludicrous to anyone that plays the game.

... people who have problems finishing a sentence?  ... people who would
modify reality to have it suit their argument?
