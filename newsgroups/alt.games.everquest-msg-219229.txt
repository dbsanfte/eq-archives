Well, the 64-bit version of OSX comes out in ten days, and I suppose all 
the core apps will have been recompiled, but legacy 32-bit software will 
stick around a long time.

I hope there is a sizeable body of 64-bit applications a year from now... 
Then again, I'm not sure if I will have upgraded by then, as I'm not 
doing anything that's particularly CPU-intensive with my Powermac. I 
toyed with the idea of getting EQ for the Mac, but I'm just too attached 
to Hanrahan.

That sucks. Me, I don't even know what the hell a floppy drive is 
anymore. Hm... Okey, I lie, my games box still has one, just in case. ;)
