That is where it breaks down right there. Just as with groups of
several tanks, one tank is going to be bearing the brunt. Let us call
him "Joe Aggro." I've seen this happen in nearly every group I was in.

The damage output is never distributed because people never back off
when getting the beat down. If six warriors WERE to back off when one
was getting hit, until another one had more aggro, this would work but
then you'd have a lessening of damage (unless one backing off switched
to a bow right away.)

You'd end up still having a lot of downtime at the end of the fight
since you'd end up with 6 warriors at 50 percent to 75 percent health.
In the case of EVERY such group, it would be better to have 5
warriors/whatever and even one druid/shaman or cleric. You could use
the same strategy of tank switching, but the one healer being there
would eliminate any downtime. The healer could spend the fight just
sitting, until it was time to heal people up. This would even work
well if it was only a second character of one of the parties, on a
seperate account being played in another EQwindows.
