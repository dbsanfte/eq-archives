Hi,

My lvl 6 untwinked human necro was given this tome by a higher lvl guy
passing by the qeynos newbie area, after equiping it in my primary
slot i can't seem to equip a dagger or any other kind of weapon,
the dagger reads primary or secondary, how come? feels somewhat
bad to have no weapon, or could it be that i hit the mob with the book
*lol*

/Regards Berth
