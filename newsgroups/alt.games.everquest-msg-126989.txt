    Question: have you verified that Drifting Death both lasts 12 ticks, and
actually does 780 damage and not 650 damage over that time? One of our
necromancers has been playing with this using my Bone-Clasped Girdle, after
a necromancer on the necro boards mentioned that it seemed to lengthen the
DoT but NOT do more damage. In testing on himself he noticed no increase in
damage output. You have?
