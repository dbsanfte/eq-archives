A Ranger fear-kiting in JP could easily fail to get 50pp in loot over
2.5 hours, Timber Griffons and Anacondas have not impressed me with
their loot drops.  The Gnolls I hunt there (damned KOS green-con animals
will wreck my faction with the locals if I venture into the trees much)
do drop enough to support a KEI habit, but those jerks at VI still
haven't added Gate and Ring of Surefall to the Paladin spell list.
