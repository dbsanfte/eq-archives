I just don't get the justification for any type of reward. Your efforts 
in this regard were a game requirement before, they won't be for others 
later. The game changed. You don't deserve anything because of it. We 
could all make arguments for restitution for various "positive" changes 
make over the years. What makes this one any different?

I want a reward for having to ride the boats all that time. I want a 
reward for having to take twice as long getting from 8 to 25 before PoP 
and PC. It's ridiculous.
