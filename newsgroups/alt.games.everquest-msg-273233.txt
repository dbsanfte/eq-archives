I think he means extra mana (to cure it) so that cheals are then casted at
normal pace.

The large non-ch heals are quite difficult to maintain for long duration
fights because they are so mana intensive (our top clerics are about 11k
mana, and say they could sustain a spam-chain for about 5 minutes before
mana becomes an issue).  Its not uncommon to be engaged for 30 minutes on
some boss fights!
