It may also be your religion/deity that you chose when you first started the
character.
I have found that when I tried to locate a vendor in the bazaar for a
particular item, it gave me a similar message in that I cannot find the
vendor easily...not leaving it at that, I wne to n a search, found the
person bought the item only to find I couldn't equip it because of my deity.
