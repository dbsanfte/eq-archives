Lotsa whining below out of me...

First off, I have the poorest memory of anyone I know.  I have trouble 
remembering the names of friends and people I work with.  I reread the 
books for the 10th time ( well, 1 read and 9 rereads, I guess ) and I was 
pretty sure that was Bombadil's wife, not daughter.  With my memory, I 
could easily be wrong.

The second I saw her, I turned to my wife and said "SHE is supposed to be 
the most beautiful .. pause ( couldn't come up with the word I wanted ) .. 
person in the land?  Bad call."  She played a good part, though.

I enjoyed the Matrix.  I'm not even close to a fanboy of it, but I loved 
the part of the bad guy, and thought the guy who played him was perfect.  
That voice of his is awesome.  I've been waiting to see him in something 
else since The Matrix, but as I don't see too many movies, I haven't, nor 
have I looked on IMDB to see what else he has been in.  The second I saw 
Elrond, I was -quite- happy.  He even sort of used TheVoice(tm).

Was the part about Elrond taking Isuldur ( sp ) to Mount Doom in -any- of 
Tolkein's books?  I sure don't remember that.

There were lots of inconsistancies from the original text, but the movie 
was enjoyable.  It was probably real good for those that haven't read it.

I really wish the movie series had been broken out into more parts, maybe 
even the original books it was written in instead of the 3 books that are 
the "Trilogy."  I'm sure there's the argument that it would be too long and 
drawn out, but if it were done well, I think people would still enjoy it.  
Unlike Star Wars.  Episode 1 half-blew, and from the 2nd trailer I have 
seen of the next one, it will be Titanic in Space.  After the trailer, we 
looked at each other and both said "renter".

I knew that Bombadil would be cut out, since he doesn't have a major impact 
on the story.  I like that about Tolkein, though - he can get away with 
spending that many pages on someone who isn't "used" again because of how 
good of a writer he was.  He's a part of history and a unique 
individual, and worth learning about in the text.  Tom -is- mentioned 
several times in the series, though.  He won't be in the movie.

I was hoping they wouldn't cut out the Barrow Wights.  It would have been 
at least 15 minute of the movie to do it right, but couldn't be justified, 
I guess.  Aragorn giving them the blades was good, though, since one of 
them slays the Ringwraith Captain, and I'm pretty sure that it was a 
Numenorian blade that he wields when he does it.

The original scene of Frodo falling at the prancing pony could have been 
kept, I think, instead of changing it up like that.  When the Wraiths 
attacked the beds, I said to the wife "I hope we hear their long wailing 
after this."  I wasn't disappointed, except I was hoping for it to be more 
blood-curling.  I did think the way they walked in a line holding their 
swords in perfect unison was too dramatic and unnecessary.

The scene with the Cave Troll was ok, but I was under the impression that 
the spear was launched at Frodo, not used to stab him.  I was looking 
forward to seeing a big spear launch into his chest, and drive him into the 
wall.  Oh, well.

The Balrog looked pretty nice.  The Cave Troll was ok.  I think they 
overdid the ugliness of the normal orcs.  Were Sauramon's Orcs half Orc, 
half Goblin in the books?  I thought thought they were half Orc half Man ( 
the wild southern men ).

Aragorn: should have looked more rugged.  He looked more like a pretty-boy 
with a beard - nothing like someone who has been out in the wild as much as 
he has.  The close-up of his fingernails was good, though.  Rather nasty, 
but fitting.

Gimli: pretty good, all around.

Borimor: pretty much what I was expecting, in looks and manner / actions.  
He could have been a little larger, though.  He looked more like I expected 
Farimir to look in size.

Gandalf: Looked pretty good, maybe a little too jovial in the beginning of 
the movie.

Frodo: I think they nailed Frodo pretty much perfectly.

Samwise: I expected someone smaller *heh*, but the part was played very 
well, I think.

Merry and Pippen: I didn't like the extra comedy that was tossed in, and 
Pippen should have been a few inches taller than the others.  Making them 
both bigger later on may be a challenge.

Legolas: Played well.  He almost lost his balance once, and I find that 
quite out of character for the Wood Elf.  The scene should have been 
reshot.  I had been wondering how they were going to show him running 
fleetingly over the snow before they went to Moria, and didn't like their 
attempt at it.

Quote of the night: "I don't know who they got to play Legolas, but that 
guy is Beautiful." - TheWife(tm)

Much better than my total Male quote: "I hope we get a good shot at Liv's 
cleavage, but I doubt it."  ( receives elbow immediately )

I guess I'm done pissing.  I enjoyed it, but kept getting yanked out of the 
immersion by the things that were wrong.  Couldn't help it.
