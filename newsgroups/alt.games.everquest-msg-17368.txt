I can't speak for higher level quests, but I know there are some quests you
can not do if your level is too high. The barbarian shaman quest where you
collect wooly fungus, for example, is not given out if you are 10th level or
higher (and since you need a no drop combine container, that means the quest
is effectively closed.) If a quest NPC won't speak to you if you are too high
a level, why won't they speak to you if you're too low?
