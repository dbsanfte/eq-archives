I've been in LGuk recently and pass these spiders.  I have been thinking
about soloing them for the silks, as they are hardly ever camped.  Are they
a pretty good source for silk, as compared to the standard Giant Spiders /
Dune types?  I have played with the ones in the Karanas ( Crag and something
else, can't remember ), but I somtimes log in before my group and have time
in Guk to mess around.
