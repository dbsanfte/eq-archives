Paladins and Shadowknights each get a horse at Level 20.  Those are
probably what you are seeing, although more people are nearing the 'buy
a horse' bankroll.

The way I make most of my money is by adventuring.  The loot you get
from certain areas (RoV, RE, RV) sells for great prices right to a
vendor.  Some of the stuff that I managed to win off of named
encounters goes for up to 4g+ (Opulescent Kite Shield, or something
similar), and that is just stuff that I can't upgrade to eventually (I
actually gave that shield to a friend instead of selling it, but you
get the idea).  I just go, hang out in a group there, then when I am
ready to call it quits, call back and sell my stuff to the vendor that
is right in front of me.  It also helps me manage my inventory space ;)

The other way is through selling the resources I gather while tooling
around in higher areas (EL, RV).  If I have a bunch of resources and
want to open up some inventory space, I'll check the brokers for the
current prices, and then usually undercut them by a bit.  If I have
some extra food/drink I will do the same thing.
