Gunthak has a wealth of undead mobs on the beach which are easily
single pulled and killed by almost any class, I'm certain you
could root rot there happily.  Quadding may be more difficult to
pull off, as the running room is a bit tight, only place I think
you could do it would be around the ships wheel which you can see
jutting out of the ground near the waterline, but groups often
pull to there so that spot might not be open.  There's lots more
to kill in Gunthak if the undead are too low for you, but I think
they'll keep you happy for several levels yet, and they are
decidedly the easiest of the mobs there.

A good trick if you want to group is to look at who is LFG and
send tells to them asking if they want to join you.  Of every 10
people LFG, only one will actually form a group, which means
there are usually lots of LFG people happy to join up with anyone
that asks.  And as a druid, you won't be anyone's first choice
for any job, but as group leader you can easily recruit people in
such a way as to leave a position open for you as DPS+backup
healer+snarer (recruit a shaman for main healer and no ranger or
necro or SK to steal your snaring role) or Main Healer (recruit a
shaman as your backup and have him mostly slow mobs, and don't
recruit a cleric_)  You don't even need to form whole groups this
way, just finding a partner to do things can be a massive
improvement in what you can accomplish and in how enjoyable it
is.  Since you can easily port to them and then take them
somewhere interesting, you make an excellent leader for pickup
groups of any size.

If you are KOS to Claws of Veeshan dragons, porting in to
Wakening Lands -can- mean instant death.  There's a dragon,
Wuoshi, who spawns at the WL portal and wanders within aggro
range of it, his aggro range is pretty much line of sight, and
he's very nasty to meet up with at your level  Oh, and he sees
invis.  He's not there all that often, though, because he's
regularly slaughtered shortly after he spawns.  But you can also
get to WL by running thru Kael Drakkar, which can be done while
invisible, if you don't get lost and end up finding giants who
see invisible; none on the main route thru the city do.  Or you
could get a port to Cobalt Scar (where you can easily check your
COV faction) and then run thru Skyshrine invisible, and enter the
Wakening Lands that way.  There's another big COV dragon,
Rolandal, in WL, but he stays put in one spot on the wall far
away from any entrance and from the tower in the lake where you
are headed for those spells, and he doesn't see invisible.
