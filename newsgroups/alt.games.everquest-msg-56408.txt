Simon,

I got my deluxe edition (EQ + Kunark + Velious + a miniature Iksar) a few
months ago in Electronics Boutique. I have also seen the same pack in PC
World.

Both EB and Amazon list it on their web sites, although Amazon say it's
temporarily unavailable.

The new expansion pack "Shadows of Luclin" is due for release in the UK on
7th December, so you could wait till then. There will probably be a special
edition containing all the expansions plus the new one.

Dave
