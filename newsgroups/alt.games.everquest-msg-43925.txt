Given that the original post was on hotmail, and the majority of hotmail users are
North American, posting about a UK-only edition is likely to be of no use
whatsoever to the poster, who is likely to have to wait for the just-released
trilogy most people are talking about, at 40 US$, rather than having the option of
buying the UK-only, �28 Deluxe Edition (over 50 US$, plus the cost of shipping back
to the US).
