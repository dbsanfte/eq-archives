My 60 rogue probably died about one bazillion times before
evade was put in.  All it took was a 7 point backstab...

My alt rogue is 51, and she hasn't died nearly as much,
but in all fairness she didn't cap her Defense skill from
level 40 until level 51, too.  Evade just kept her away from
hate, unless she wanted it.  She still dies...died 5 times
in one hour during a Hate raid about a month ago...3 times
as the only person (tank-mezzing an add on a cleric is
NOT a rogue's job...) :-).

My 51 wizard has died 4 times in her career, and literally
all 4 were just from LD while fighting.  She's not even wearing
any gear besides T-Boots and a Dragoon Dirk, although
I am thinking of getting her some Drakescale/Shardtooth
just for a "leather" look.  Why? Because she can take down
mobs without them ever touching her, and if they resist
too much, she just runs away (T-Boots are far and away
the ONLY piece of twink gear a mage or wizard or necro
_needs_).

My gnome SK is 15 and he prolly died 30 or 40 times before
level 10.  Newbie translocate to bind...
