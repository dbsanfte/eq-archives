OK< if you have a mod rod mage and a cleric, all other mana regen
is utter nonsense.  Wait till magicians have mana?  Don't be silly.
Mage makes mod rod, takes a couple hits, hands remaining charge
to cleric, cleric takes that hit.  Mage makes and eats another rod,
and another.  Cleric CHeals mage.  Mage mods cleric, mods cleric,
mods cleric, mods self, mods cleric, mods self, cleric Cheals self,
cleric Cheals mage.. both are at near full mana and near full health

This takes significantly less time than "mage and cleric med to full
with C3, BAOR or POTC, and a bard singing mana at you.

If your mage -doesn't- have mod2, then there's no real reason to
bother waiting for them to have full mana anyway, Mod junior
isn't all that much help.

If you are waiting for shaman and mage while your clerics are FM
already... then you have shaman and mages who aren't using their
vastly superior mana regen capability.  Shaman have canna, and
mages have ultracanna, and heck, that FM cleric is available to
regen the canna/mod2 hp loss, or there's  probably a druid standing
around whining about having no role in a raid... let them heal up
the people busy trading HP for mana.

Well, shaman and mages, actually.  Thus my point here.  IF you said
"waiting on the chanter" I'd not have a leg to stand on, because the
chanter mana regen buff isn't self only, cleric mana regen actually
blows them out of the water at 58+... unless they get POTC, which
puts them back at the same mana regen.  Chanters, though, can
steal mana from mobs if there are caster mobs handy.  And the
class generally is perfectly happy going into even the largest
battles at half mana, they don't have a lot of high cost spells that
need to be cast.  Lets see, who else might we be waiting on.  Necros..
as you say, have faster regen than KEI, but more importantly, how
often do they "need to be FM?" Wizards... now there might be a
bottleneck.  I've never seen a wizard stop a raid by being LOM
while everyone else is fine, but I can imagine it happening.  At lower
levels their "I'm stunned 10 seconds but have more mana" thing is
a clear win over cleric, but by the time we are discussing BAoR,
this is clearly an "also ran" in the mana regen field.  Would think
there would be an upgrade for that to keep pace with everyone
else.  Druids?  Ahem.  Little cough here.  DOn't mind me.  No,
I'm not laughing (gasps for breath) just taken aback a bit at people
holding up raid cause druid LOM.... anyway they have (feigns
cough again) POTC plus KEI so are no worse off than the cleric,
and probably spent less mana on the fight.
