> What are some good zones for an untwinked lvl 37 pally to solo?

The current "Hot Zones" are:

60-65 Plane of Torment
55-60 Chardok
50-55 Grieg's End
45-50 Nurga
40-45 City of Mist
35-40 Kaesora
30-35 Dalnir
25-30 Hollowshade Moor
20-25 Runnyeye

I would suggest that you first try Kaesora, but be careful as it can be easy
to get lost and difficult to get back out if you are not wary.  Take a good
map with you and/or someone who knows the zone.  It houses quite a bit of
undead as well.  Another to try would be the City of Mist, in the Emerald
Jungle, off of the Field of Bone.  I have seen it fairly easy to get groups
there, and working the zone line area (look out for the holes in the
bridge).  There are a good number of undead here as well.
