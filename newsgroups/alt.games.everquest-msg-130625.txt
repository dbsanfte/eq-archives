Not that many if you are glowering to IB. If you have to go to Neriak
after helping the pale elves then here is a way. If you see me in
Neriak I expect a tip for this information.

First and foremost,we don't mind ogres in Neriak, just don't block the
hallways, and please FIND the restrooms BEFORE you have to use them...

Here is my take. Con Kizdean gix, if he is KoS to you, kill rangers in
Kith (~25-35)or Innothule or go to TD and kill rangers there(~8-20).
As SOON as he is not KoS, go do the Halfling raiders skullcap quest.
That quickly gets you to lovey dovey.

Do the red wine quest if you intend on spending any time in Neriak. 

Crushbone slaves are slow faction and have the problem of worsening
faction in case an Orc jumps you. I wouldn't bother even since you are
in CB anyhoo. I think CB is a waste anyway. Too crowded and too many
doods. Go to Unrest, get yourself to Lavastorm and Najena, go to
Befallen, do the chessboard in BB, or even go to the Warrens. They
money in lavastorm and the Najena entrance is much better.

The skullcap quest is not that bad, and there are plenty of those
pesky halfings ready to give them to you, just for killing them.

/ooc If you go to any spoiler board, they can help you with the
details of the quests.
