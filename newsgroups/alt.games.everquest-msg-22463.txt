You have to do that with almost anything.  Even Casters have to drop a
point into Specializations, and most drop a point each into the other
casting skills.  You don't have to, but most people get fed up with battles
that go like this:

you begin to cast a spell
A Decaying Skeleton takes 5 points of non-melee damage
fizzle
fizzle
fizzle
fizzle
fizzle
fizzle
fizzle
You have been slain by a Decaying Skeleton!
