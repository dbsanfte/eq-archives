I disagree.  Most life sentences do not go till death.  Not because of
sentence being reversed, but because they are eligible for parole in X
years.  If they meant till the inmate dies then they should have said it.
That would have been easier to say rather than "till the end of
incarceration".  I think they included life sentences that did not go full
term in order to bias the statistic because they wanted to make a political
point.
