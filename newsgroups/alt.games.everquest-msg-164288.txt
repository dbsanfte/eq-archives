Actually what Vernat said was that PoP would be aimed at high level
players (note, not raid focused players, more high level players are in
level spread guilds than uberguilds) and tuned with lots of doable
single group encounters.

What they didn't say was "you need to first equip all the players in
your single group with items from mobs requiring massively multi-group
raids with huge time commitments".

Yeah it's not a good comparison as you could solo quite happily in
pre-nerf Ssra basement.  But ignoring that situation which no longer
exists, yes PoV is many fold easier than any part of Ssra.

This says more about you than I could possibly think of the correct
insult to phrase.

Sucks to be you, I do feel sorry for you.
