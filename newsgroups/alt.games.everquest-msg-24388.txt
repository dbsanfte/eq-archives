}So, the 'ugly models' you're complaining of will be optional.

See, I find that a highly ambiguous statement.  The simplest, most obvious 
(to me) interpretation of it doesn't satisfy me at all.  I take it to mean 
that there will be a flag settable in the client such that on my computer, 
only old models or new models will be displayed.  This leads to a 
situation where to me, I look like good ol' Zinphandel, but to half the 
population, I look like Danny DeVito.  I don't like that.  What I want to 
be able to set is how I look to other people, not just to me.  What I 
would like to see is a Norrath in which the trolls that want to look like 
fat, chunky old-style trolls are able to do so, and the ones that want the 
new troll-lite look can have that.  But I think that's going to be 
massively more difficult to program, so I really doubt they're going to do 
it.  

I mean, what's the point in picking a face for your character if half the 
population's going to see something completely different anyway?

But please, Brad, tell me I'm wrong!
