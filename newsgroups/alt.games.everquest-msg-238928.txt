Yes, you have five or three minutes, I forget which.  But you can camp and
log back on and the timer will reset.

It's fairly common to keep doing this camp / log-on / camp cycle if someone
goes linkdead and the raid can suddenly no longer support all the unflagged
folks.  You keep camping and logging on until the linkdead person comes
back.

Yes.  You do have a grace period to yoink a sword or something.  Of course,
this means your paladin is useless until you get your drop of uberness.  =)
