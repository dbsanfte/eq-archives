All of our motherboards are P4P800's, Intel based, but the 
board revisions and BIOS revisions are not identical. Thanks 
for the heads up, I'll contact Kingston and see if our 
particular RAM sticks are on that list!

Symptom here was also random resets, but usually only during 
the optimization phase of a compile.
