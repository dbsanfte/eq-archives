The fact everything you say points to total ignorance?

You don't know jack from shit. Since you are giving everyone else
their preferred soloing equipment how about giving druids theirs?
Epic, bracer, and the symbol of tunare thingy. They now have mana-free
dots, snare, AND root. I killed every raptor on the big island, at
once, and was full mana at the end... at L55, without the free root
which I still haven't gotten.

Fact is, you don't know what you're talking about. 

I encourage you to keep talking, however. Your ignorance is amusing to
me.
