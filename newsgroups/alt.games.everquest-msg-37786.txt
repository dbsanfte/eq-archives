If you can't camp an item that you can't use, Rogues and shadowknights would
never get their class armors, because neither can solo in Cazic Thule, and your
code would make that necessary.  I do agree that tradeskills need more of an
incentive to do them, as you can get better equipment off of mobs everytime than
anything you can make tradeskills wise with the possible exceptions of pw and
banded for newbies, and tailored Backpacks and quitvers.
