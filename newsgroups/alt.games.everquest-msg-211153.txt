Another inexpensive MMORPG is "The 4th Coming".  Several companies run
servers (the company that developed it licenses it out to others to put on
their servers).  I won't mention any specific places running T4C servers,
because the place I work is one of them, so it might be seen as spam.  I
don't play, but from what I've seen when I've had to look at it as part of
work, some people like it a lot.

There's also Blade Mistress (http://www.blademistress.com/), which has the
funniest FAQ of any MMORPG I've seen.  (Too bad it wasn't intentionally
funny...)
