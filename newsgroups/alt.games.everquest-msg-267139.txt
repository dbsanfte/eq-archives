If you like muds maybe. Other than that I have enough fingers left over
without going to toes. And do you remember the old saying? If it ain't
broke don't fix it.

How can you say obviously? Unless you're the designer you *don't* know. How
many players stay in EQ1 now just for raiding? Or just because friends do?

Five points that don't necessarily add up to 'destroying'. Yes I read it
and no, I don't agree. That's why I posted. I don't specifically agree that
EQ2 has killed EQ1. What was the original design decisions. For all you
know, Verant (then Sony) had an original five year lifespan. Maybe they're
keeping it alive for the simple fact that it *is* doing as well as it has
done.

Neither was I. I was just pointing to some flaws in your opinions.
