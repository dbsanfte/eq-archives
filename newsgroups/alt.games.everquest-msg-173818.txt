Let me be the first to say, CRYSTAL CAVERNS.
Exp up to mid 40's, tons of gems and velium. Lots of higher level stuff too.
Just farm the zone, everything but dwarfs. Geos drop gems worth 100pp Spider
Queen drops decent loot too. Higher Level toons and farm Rygor for the rygor
chain armor. Tons to do in that area and I personally still get exp ther at
47.
Levina Lanier Druid 47 and almost complete set of Elysian armor, not bad for
level 47
