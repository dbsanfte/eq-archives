Root no longer overwrites snare, you can now safely root and snare both..]
which is great for root and shoot, since when the root breaks the mob
just walks slowly in your direction while you re-apply snare.

ON the other hand, in your scenario, the mob isn't likely to live long enough
to see the root wear off, but since he's rooted he -will- turn around
and defend himself, causing lots of unnecessary damage.  Root is a
crowd control tool more than anything else, you certainly don't want it
going off unpredictably, which is one reason I'm often trying to get
mages not to use their earth pets.
