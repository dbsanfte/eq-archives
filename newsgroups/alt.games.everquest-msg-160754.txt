Not only does it depend on  race/class/religion, it depends on your level.
as a DE necro in my low 50s, it took me one evening of serious dedication -
killing everything in the burrow about 5 times. After a while, I settled
into a comfortable circuit between green room and cloverleaf room. I still
have to be careful, because the casters hate me.

I also handed in a few bonechips to Lashun Novashine so that the Priests and
Pallys would tolerate me.

Holly is a ranger. To fix her faction, you need to kill the jagged pine
gnolls - the darkpaw ones. I can safely use the Karanas based druid rings
now, and run through Surefall Glade with no trouble. Suckers.
