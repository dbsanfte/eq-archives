Very true, although I would not recommend quadding till around level 32
(unless heavily twinked, like most of your chars seem to be anyway Lance),
as you wont have the mana.

Research (or more likely in your case, buy from bazaar), column of lightning
(level 24 AOE), get some sow pots / jboots and take out the gnolls in SK, or
zelniaks / mushrooms in dawnshroud, I believe the stonegrabbers in Marus
Seru have a high resistance rate, so wouldnt recommend these to quad (the
greyhoppers on the other hand, should be viable).

At 34 you get circle of force (researched), get to 35 on the gnolls then
head to EW, where I am told you can quad Walrus' quite easily (I havent
tried this myself so am not sure).

I know quadding frost giants is not possible at my level, heck even taking
them down with standard nukes is tough, with there resistances / HP at the
moment.

Unless you have clarity though, expect around 5-10 mins of downtime between
kills, and you will get about 3-4 quads per sow potion.  Harvest helps, but
not a huge amount.
