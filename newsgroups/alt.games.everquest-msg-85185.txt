And at that time it just becomes like PoA, you use the ghetto CoH in
which you zone in, join your group, die, get rezzed, leave an item on
the corpse, have the necro summon your corpse, and then get another
rez/revive.  Believe me, with a bit of practice you can get this
almost as fast as a regular CoH.
