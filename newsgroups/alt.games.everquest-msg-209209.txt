Darkbreed of Norrath on Zeb had a huge split a couple months back.  Now, DBN
is a cool name.  The former members who left to form their own guild named
it "Fellowship of the Faithful" aka "Whatever of the BlahBlah."

Eh, I have to admit that you can have a vanilla name and still take it
seriously.  I used to be a member of Eternal Valor, which sounds vanilla
enough but I was very loyal and tried to live up to the name.  But, to
continue defending them, that was back in '99 when Verant still took the
idea of guilds seriously and actually approved them instead of rubber
stamping them.
