From the shadows, the mysterious Sean Kennedy <x@n.n> (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>OOOOOH - a silent majority.  Hmmmmmm.  Ok, I'll bite - how many people
>read this newsgroup regularly?  How many of them emailed you in support?
>
>Cite please.

There are few sweeter signs of someone who knows they are at rock
bottom when they bring up a "silent majority who emailed me in
support"....

This is the same bigot who couldn't figure out how to email more than
one in twentyfive people by his OWN ADMISSION.

Man it must suck to get caught in lies as much as Bigot Andrew the
Liar. But I can't wait to see the number he decides to make up.
Probably have as much resemblance to reality as his numbers claiming
his other groups all topposted. LOL
