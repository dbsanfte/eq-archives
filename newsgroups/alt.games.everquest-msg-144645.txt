Ridiculous.  This past week I spent $150 on the web using sites that
worked perfectly with my browser.  Over the course of the last 12
months I must have spent close to $3000 online.  These days, the web
is the first place I go when I get the urge to splurge.  I love the
convenience of shopping without leaving home.

Oh, and just FYI:  a desirable customer = anyone with $$ to spend

I don't cry, I just move on to some other site.  The only real losers
here are those who think browser compatibility is either unnecessary
or just too much work to bother with.  I have no doubt that some
programmers might consider this a headache.  So what?  They get paid
to solve problems, and those who find it easier to make this happen
will have a competitive edge over those who feel as you do.

My criteria for using a site are:
1) It has to load quickly;
2) No flashy stuff please.  I don't want entertainment. I want
   information, or I just want to do business.  If I want to be
   entertained I'll play a game.

... and for business sites:

3) the security features better be working or no sale;
4) email confirmation of orders within 5 minutes;
5) email notification upon shipment;
6) repeat business for those stores that tie in their warehouse
   database with their sales pages, so I know what I'm ordering
   is in stock now;
7) bonus points for those business that allow me to track my
   shipments.

I tried out Netscape 6x - what a mess!  Totally disorganized.
And who cares what how pretty the damn window frames are?  Ugh!
Of course, I've used Microsoft's attempts at internet software.
Hard to avoid.  I had to work very hard to surgically remove IE
and OE because they came pre-installed with WinME on my new
(last year) system.  But I don't regret the effort, Netscape
does what I want it to do, the way I want it to.  I believe I'll
be able to continue using my Netscape 4.78 for a long time, and
I really *do* like the way it does mail and newsgroups.  ;-)
