Scuzzee drive, teach, doctor, light bird, horses are all shortened forms.
SCSI, Small Computer Systems Interface, teacher, medical doctor, Lt. Colonel
and horse power are the proper forms of these.  Ebonics is another example
of this habit, as are contractions.

Creating slang or any other type of a vernacular is very popular in every
other part of humanity, why should it not happen in EQ?
