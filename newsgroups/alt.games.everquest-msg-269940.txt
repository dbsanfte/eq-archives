One good character to play, one evil character to play, one good character
to be a vendor, and one evil character to be a vendor.  That uses all your
slots.

And then there are those of us who knew people from EQ1, and they ended up
on different servers.  I could consume 4 slots just trying to get one
character on each server where people I know from EQ1 and want to play with
ended up.
