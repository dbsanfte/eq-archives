There's no upgrade potential in a socket 7 motherboard - all AMD's new,
faster chips (Durons, Athlons etc) use socket A, so you're pretty much
limited to a 500MHz CPU, which just ain't gonna cut it when Luclin comes
out. I'd recommend spending the money on a new mobo before you buy an
old PCI video card - the move to AGP has made them obsolete so it would
really be a waste of money, you're likely to chuck the card out with the
mobo when you *do* upgrade.

You may find a bios update on the mobo manufacturer's website that will
allow you to use faster CPUs than were out when the board was released
(which will be the limitation of 333Mhz listed in the manual). Of
course, if its another socket 7 motherboard, see above.
