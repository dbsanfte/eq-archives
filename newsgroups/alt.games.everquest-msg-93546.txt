Nope. I do think there is a discipline down the line that uses Dragon Punch 
or Eagle Strike though...

I do not believe so, but that skill raises sloooooow.

My monk (25 now) ignored 1hb until 20... do NOT do that!

I would save up 300pp or so and sit in your servers auction zone looking 
for Essence of Dol (10/27 1hb off hand .1 stone) and a Bam,boo Bo Stick 
(2hb, 8/20, 1 stone). Carry these around,m and when you ding, the only 
skill you will need to train is 2hb, which you will already have a weapon 
for :)

Oh, and at 17 Feign at every opportunity. That skill makes you soloable, as 
well as being an invaluable aggro tool.
