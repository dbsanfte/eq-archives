I can see your guys point, but you are missing, that I am selling the GAME,
acct is FREE.  No reason to keep acct if I don't have the game is what I'm
thinking, and whats wrong with trying to make a buck?

Well, to the buyer of my auction willing to take the risk, he/she will be
rewarded well.  And you guys know that when someone auctions off a
character, You never hear of the hundreds accts sold daily throughout the
web that are succesful, you just hear of the few really bad ones.  And if it
scares you, don't bid.  And I am from the USA not Russia lol.

And all you sourpusses out their flaming me, well hehe, you are just getting
more advertisment for my auction selling the game, with FREE acct,  all I'm
trying to do is to get a lil money back from the couple years I played.

Keep the flames commin! :)
