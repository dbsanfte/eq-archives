I personally would have joined her ragtag team and helped out, I've
done that more than once.  But since it was my guildmate cleric that
spotted it and she wanted to gank (within the server agreement
guidelines, that is) I didn't volunteer my services.  Just as well, I
don't think a 60 cleric would have put their force over the line
anyway.  Now if my guild had helped out...well in the end thats
what we did, just not on purpose.

Yep, I was not a fan of the "they can't do it" reasoning.  Wait out
the ten minutes.  If they manage the kill, kudos to them.  If not,
well in all honesty I don't see how they could have expected to
with that force, similar to trying to take down naggy with two
groups just because a glitch lets you include a couple of 55s.

How long do you have before depop?  And you say "without aggro...
could he have been kited around for 10 minutes?  If the list cleric
managed to get ready for another try in that time, easy enough
to train her with him, if not, take it to the killing force, but free of
any moral quandry.
