One of my oldest EQ friends has recently started playing again, and guild 
has a couple free nights coming up, so I was planning on doing some duoing 
with him.  He's a 44 Paly and I'm a 59 bard, so I'm having a hard time 
thinking of places where we can be useful and get exp.  I am thinking Guk 
deadside, since I know that there is still a lot of blue and light-blue 
there, but they're old-world, low-hp monsters, and palys love redeading 
undead.  Can anyone suggest other places where this odd duo can hunt 
successfully?  I know several places I can hunt with a mid50s paly, but 
most of those guys would con red to this poor paly.
Oh well, I'll have beer and it will all be good.
