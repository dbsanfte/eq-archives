If they don't do a much better job on the epics in EQ2, then I'm not even
going to try the game (assuming they have epics, that is).

Phinny is particularly bad.  Good design, if it has to include tedious
camping in order to limit things, would be to make the tedious parts
soloable.  For parts that require a group or raid, they should either (1)
always give the epic component (unless the group/raid screws up), or (2) be
in areas the the group or raid would want to go even if there were no epic
components possible.

Having to ask your friends and/or guild to go to some zone that is annoying
and offers them nothing 10 or 20 times is ridiculous.
