Personally I would probably not have left.   I would have calmly explained
that I had been there several hours already so it was obvious he had not
been camping them.  If he had persisted in harassing me I would have
attempted to find out who his guild leader was and talk to them.  If that
did not work and they became more bombastic and harassing, I would have
involved a GM.  It is truly a hard call though, because as you said, his
guild is prominent and you don't want to make yourself look bad or make
enemies.  The other side of the coin is that I since I had been there a
fairly long time I might have decided to just do something else like
tradeskills or such instead of getting into a conflict.  It all depends on
how much of a dick he was and how much he pissed me off.
