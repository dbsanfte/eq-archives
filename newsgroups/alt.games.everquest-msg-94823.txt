Well, you'll have to admit that quad-kiting isn't a hunting technique 
that's very friendly to fellow players. If someone gets too close to the 
cluster, they are likely to be hit by whatever the creatures hit for, 
doubled or tripled depending on the mob, plus bashed or kicked, TIMES 
FOUR.

With the famous z-axis difference bug, it's very hard to tell where 
people may be sitting or meditating if you are quadding in a hilly area, 
so while careful quadding will avoid accidents most of the time, 
sometimes you will make yourself an enemy of someone you haven't even 
seen sitting there, until you come right up to them.

Hell, even a pretty sedate technique like root/dotting can be dangerous 
for passers-by if root breaks... In Rathe Mountains, I've eaten quite a 
lot of damage trying to steer giants away from people who are sitting 
down doing their own root/dotting, after my root has worn off. Keeping a 
rooted, aggresive mob in the middle of a busy throughfare will be frowned 
upon. =)
