The question I've got is whether giving a spell like this to Druids
wouldn't have the effect of reducing the value of a 58+ Paladin, by
adding another class with a combat-useful group heal.  Or am I wrong
about it being only Paladin and Cleric that are capable of effective
group heal (as opposed to single-target) in combat?

I'm wondering if it wouldn't make more sense from the perspective of
current class balance to give Druids a more beefy single-target
heal-over-time?  They already have an xp-group useful high-powered
regen, correct?  So wouldn't upgrading that single-target spell give
Druids something more to contribute without watering down the role
of another "limited desirability" class?
