Im not in my servers #1 guild, I've seen my raid get lagged out and then
walked over by a rival guild many many times.

A lot of servers are not unlike mine.. you get 1 shot at a mob, and when you
wipe the guild above you kills it before you can CR.

That was the case in Velious and Luclin anyway - in PoP the wasted trials
and hours/days wait before it can be re-attempted give the same result (some
have been changed to recycle in a few hours now, rather than the old 3 days
method)

Sure its not great to learn an encounter with a shot here and there, but in
a very competitive world you make do witth what opportunities come your way

The LC offer was actually quite decent in some respects (getting multiple
days to try the encounter)
