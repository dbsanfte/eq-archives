ive been playing about 3 wks now and can already tell who are ebayers and
who are not.

if you are lvl 47 im guessing you also know who is ebaying and who is not.

yes it is frutrating to see idiot lvl 50 iksar monks pulling chancellor to
your lvl 20 group b/c he is getting his butt kicked but i digress

but this wouldnt happen if verant took the stance that it was outlawed and
just ban that accounts...they claim this can happen but i was following a
thread where a paladine who had just got the best weapon in the game for his
class left guild and was trying to sell account and ppl called him on it and
reported him but verant didnt ban the account so what can you do
