I got my dander up a bit at the original post because it seemed to spawn the
ole Shamans are overpowered argument.

But shamans do make good pullers in some situations.  A shaman can run out
and round up a MOB and bring it back already slowed and ready to get beat
on.  Then when it's about half way down head out for the next one, bring it
back just in time for the first one to drop.  Of course this only works
where the shaman isn't going to pick up a lot of adds and can withstand a
few hits.
