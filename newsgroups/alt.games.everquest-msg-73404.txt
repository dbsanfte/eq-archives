Sad thing is, you don't even have to misspell it.  A while back I
petitioned a phonetic spelling of Frodo.  Guide I talked to didn't
understand what I was complaining about.  When I pointed out that
"Frodo" was one of the main characters of LoTR, he said that he had
never read the trilogy.  Guide talked to a GM, came back, and said
that the name was ok.

At that point I pretty much stopped worrying about petitioning names,
unless they are incredibly offensive.
