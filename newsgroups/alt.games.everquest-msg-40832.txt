Never really understood this, though it seems a common opinion.

For weapons, the best of the best are about 20 to 30% better than the
merely good, which are about twice as good as fine steel.

Or in other words, a rusty dagger is something like 3/20, a trakasaur
tooth is 10/20, whereas a primal spear is 13/20. 

A haste item can add another 40%, I guess. 

I would say EQ is much much much more level dependant than it is
equipment dependant - I would back a level 55 with fine steel weapons
and bronze armour over a level 50 with cobalt and frostbringer any day.
