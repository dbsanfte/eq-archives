I would have thought "above average" was "good" by definintion. Maybe
it's just semantics.

That's a generalization. Some models of IBM PCs certainly do use generic
components that can be replaced/upgraded with OEM parts. Their higher
end machines, however, such as the Intellistation series, certainly are
not. They have a lot of proprietary crap in them.

Again, generalizing. Others should be careful not to take that statement
as a flat truth. My Intellistation takes RDRAM which, with the help of
many folks here, was only found at two sources: IBM and Kingston, and
the Kingston one appeared to have come from IBM and was being "re-sold".
The price was 209. That's a delta of $189, more than triple your quote.
Let the buyer beware.

Not according to a lot of testing released by independent (non-IBM)
sources. It depends what you want them for. Again.... if you want a
gaming machine, IBM is not the place to shop. For other business
purposes, however, if you have the money it's often the way to go, if
only for the support network, as you mention below.

Very true. On the occasions I've had trouble with their equipment, they
seem to have people available nearly 24/7 to help out with questions,
etc.
