Turns out that a family member had blocked cookies from 'sony.com' domains
(even though I had station cookies on 'always allow.')

Sony needs to slap their HTML/DHTML/Web Services idiots for not checking to
see if cookies are being persisted.  Idiots.  It takes about 30 seconds of
code writing to do that.
