Yeah...so?

I guess you're talking a higher-end game than I've reached.  My
wizard is mid-20's.

Keeping in mind I've only played my mage to high teens, I have
to say: no, I wasn't joking.

My wizard root is resisted a lot.  When it's not resisted, it
breaks early a lot.  It's hard to cast when 2-3 mobs aggro you
(you get interrupted too much to get the spell off).

A mage pet holds the attention of a single mob, or even multiple
mobs, very well, and very reliably and consistently.  That's why
I call a mage's pet a "better root than Root" (notice the
capitalization I used).

: 1) You have no control on when a magician casts root
: 2) Magician pet root rarely sticks

I wasn't talking about the earth pet's root spell.  Just their
ability to essentially keep a mob out of your hair.

: Magician pets also can't "smarly root", i.e ghetto mez (rooting adds out of
: the way)

Smarly?
