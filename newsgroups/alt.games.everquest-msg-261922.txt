At i sit through the seventh hour of camping faelin bloodbriar in greater
fay, I noticed i'd maxed out my factions simply by sitting there. My pet
killed orc pawns by the bucketload, and the occasional centurion as well. It
occurred to me that any pet class has an enormous factional advantage if
there exists a relatively easy mob with the faction hits you want.

All they have to do is have a macro that makes them sit. Green mob attacks
in kamikaze for no adequatedly explored reason. Pet kills mob. Faction goes
up. Re-sit. Repeat 10000 times any faction that can be maxed should be
maxed. If on the other hand you can't get a pet (say an iksar monk) then you
are damned to days or weeks of boredom killing green green mobs. I think you
should be able to see your faction levels, tougher mobs should yield high
faction hits (the iksar saved our village from the dragon! Perhaps he is not
so inherently terrible after all and we will like him more than if he soloed
an orc pawn) and there should always be a way to 'redeem' yourself without
trickery like illusions and charm. Example: there's nothing local to
barbarians that yields positive barbarian faction hits, but killing some guy
across the continent impresses them fractionally.

I know that faction is roleplaying, and most players of everquest weren't
alive when the idea was about that everquest was a roleplaying game, and the
current developers will never make it any less mindless than it is, but
maybe one day someone will make a mmog with roleplaying aspects.

Until then!
