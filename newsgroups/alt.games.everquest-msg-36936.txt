The 2 bst locations in my experience are South Karana,and Lake of Ill Omen.
Both zones are full of twinks who have lots of spare cash and in their
effort to level super fast they will pay well for rezzes when they die.

I wouldn't worry about it too much at 39, since you only have the 50% exp
rez.  Most players hold out for 90% rez.  I was eben in Ill Omen once and
had a player refuse to take a Level 59 Paladin rez, because he was hoping on
a 56 Cleric rez.  Advertizing yourself is a bad idea, because the even after
you've left the zone, and are halfway around the world,  people will give
you tell to go back and rez them.

Gauntlets of the Black are going fairly cheaply these days, about 1k, and
they're better than both Paladin and Cleric planar and Kunark gloves.
Depending on your race, if you're a Gnome/HighElf/Erudite/DarkElf  I'd go
for Runed Mithril Bracers over the cleric quest bracers because of the added
STR.  If AC isn't an issue for you(for me it's WIS first, everything else
second)  get yourself to the spawn site of Dyllin Starshine in Highpass, and
log out the day of a patch, and monitor the servers.  As soon as all the
servers are online and accepting log ons, log in, Kill Dyllin and loot his
page.  Use it for the Testament of Vanear quest, it's a 10 WIS 10 Mana book
for your off hand.  If you have a lot of patience you can also quest a Paw
of Opolla for 9 WIS and 9 AC, or if you've maxed your WIS, get a Cone of the
mystics to add 5 WIS and 50 mana.  It runs about 2k on Fennin.
