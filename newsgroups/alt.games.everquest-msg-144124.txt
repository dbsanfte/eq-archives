Chimp and Gimp were paying the Great Saphoryte a social call and the Gimp
and in the midst of clearing all the Bogling Cultists asked one of lifes
most difficult questions:

"What's this Religion thing Master, all these cultists about and all, what's
it all about?"

Shite. That was my first thought. Shite was also the second thought as well.
Anyway about 17 thoughts later when the word "Shite" finally abated, I
decided to show Gimp some examples to let him make up his own mind. Finding
a stray Bible and Koran in my backpack (with the firewood, matches and other
camping utilities) I decided it was time to take some off the usual
pillaging and let Gimp find the answers for himself.

Gimp read them carefully, scratched his boney chin and looked as though he
was about to have a revelation of some sort...

"Bollocks"

I thought Gimp may have made his decision a bit too lightly so decided to
take him to an expert for some more thorough discussion. There is is nothing
worse than having a Gimp who suddenly developing a dilemna of conscience
when in the midst of genocide. So I take him to Darian the Preacher, Gimp
armed with his religous texts and a plethora of questions and Darian with
his years of experience as a religious nut.

It was an interesting debate which must have been quite draining on poor
Darian who promply expired. Concerned Gimp may be not totally at peace of
mind yet, I took him to another nearby expert on the topic, Priestess
Tarafol. I did my best to explain that the Priestess was female so there was
certain protocols to be followed and that he had to be an example of
gentleness this time around...

I was horrified by the resulting debate, Gimp was completely merciless and
poor Tarafol expired in a matter of minutes.

"How can you kill innocent women and children?" I cried.

"Easy - you just don't read them so much" Gimp quipped before laughing
maniacly.
