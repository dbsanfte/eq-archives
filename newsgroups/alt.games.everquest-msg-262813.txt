From someone who 2-boxes a cleric, beside a monk...  I tend to form my own
groups, find a tank and a slower and I'm good to go.  I got a tank the other
day that was so underequipped I literally would have made a better tank, and
monks aren't known for great tanking ability.  The 2k+ hp advantage I had on
this tank would have made up for it though.  Fighting the stuff I have to
fight for experience, it was quite a task to keep this person standing (and
I didn't once, whereupon I finished tanking with my monk and less heals
needed).

I wish I'd asked that person their hp before inviting them to the group. 
I'm sure you're running into people that have already had similar
experiences.

When the cleric gets low on mana, they say it, and pulls can slow down or
stop.  The group lives.  When tanks drop from full health to 20% in one
round, the group is screwed and can't do anything about it.

By the way, my example group I had the other day was in Wall of Slaughter. 
=)

I did end up finishing tanking multiple mobs in a PG group with an
underequipped tank too, but that was more than a bad tank, it was also a bad
slower and a bad cleric (wasn't 2-boxing, cause my laptop still crashes in
PG).  Monks *really* shouldn't tank in PG.  =)
