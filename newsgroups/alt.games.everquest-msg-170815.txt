Well, if you havent got optional downloads on then I think there is a zone
or two you wont know of (Stonebrunt and Jagged Pine I think are
optionals)...but nothing to worry about as they are much higher than you
current level.....when you here people talking about them and get curious
then download them...they are not needed now.

Info: Well someone got there with the keymapping, change auto
attack....change it RIGHT now..the other guy means it, I mean it....its
probably the most awkward keymap Ive ever run across. I repeat stop
reading this post and change that key now.....

Once thats done, you said a monk, you've had skills and useful stuff
mentioned...but now find the monk trainer if you havent already. You didnt
say Qeynos or Freeport based....in both cases stay above ground and
explore the city. Learn where the docks are, the merchants of various
types and try the odd quest ni the city.....allakhazam will have them.
I assume here you are playing a human, not any other race....I'd advise
this.


Once you are oriented properly, go hand that note you have to your class
head....you get basic kit and an intro to the newbie quests.....find those
newbie quests either in game or in allakhazam and start doing them...they
are a useful selection of things to learn to do and get you walking round
the local area.

If the next quest is too tough then walk round the newbie yard (the area
just outside the city but in the same zone), and gather xp and ideally a
few bodyparts/quest items. A lot are no drop and some people will call out
the location of these so you might pick a few up early. Possibly once you
hit lvl 5 explore out to the adjacent areas and have a look about to see
what is around....as you go higher in level do the same....dont worry too
much about dying up to level 10, you dont lose xp and you keep all your
equipment on your respawn.

Learn your new skills level by level. For a monk bind wound is very useful
if you have spare practise points. Fighting will improve your weapon and
hand to hand/kicking skills. Sense heading is a skill to put onto a
hotkey, and mash as often as you possibly can. You will like this later.
Once you get closer to lvl 10 you might consider grouping with people to
hunt.....in Freeport that means an orc camp in East Commonlands probably,
and near Qeynos possibly a foray to Blackburrow. Make sure everyone knows
you are new and they explain what they want from you. Learn how to group
effectively this way.
