The Dark Reflection is opposed to the Gemchoppers, so killing
any mob with Gemchopper faction (the gnome warrior/guard
guild) raises the faction.   There's also a couple of quests which
raise the faction but they also involve faction hits to the
Gemchoppers.

Considering where the Dark Reflection is located, it's surprisingly
easy to get back there once you get past the guards at both the
entrance and the city wall.  The (good) cleric guild is offset and
the NPCs on Gemchopper faction are out of aggro range as you
pass though.

BTW, the Dark Reflection is *not* the gnome necro guild.  It's all
the gnome followers of Bertoxx.  They can be any class a gnome
can be:  cleric, wizard, mage, enchanter, warrior and rogue as well
as necro.   With seven trainers there, it's a pretty dangerous place
if you're KoS...

The "easiest" way to raise faction is to kill Gemchoppers or other
notable gnome NPCs.   The isolated guards in Steamfont are
level 35 and Zigg Finn in North Freeport (the blue building near
the bank area) is level 25 (according to Allakazam's) but I'd tend
to believe he's a bit higher...
