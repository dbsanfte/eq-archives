Hello!  I'm now playing a 43 troll beastlord on Bristlebane (mmm... 3 yellows
to beastcrack!).  I recently joined a "family"-style guild, and they had a raid
on Kael this Sunday.  I looked over the Thurgadin quest armor and came to a
depressing realization.  I probably wouldn't equip any of it, if I got it! 
Now, I'll admit that I've been playing for about 1.5 years, and my bazaar
trader has scored some impressive deals (e.g. Zekhas' Katar for 500 plat).  My
hastily cobbled together magelo is below.  This is currently my highest level
character, so any "twinkage" is due to mudflation and luck in the Bazaar, not a
65 sugar daddy (I don't strip my old characters, in case I want to go back to
them).  Nevertheless, it just seems wrong that the best Velious gear is now
something that I would just as soon let rot (except perhaps to keep bagged for
the clicky effect).  Is my perspective totally off base, or have I just come to
a realization of how bad the mudflation really is?
