I enjoy being a chanter puller. Before enounters and at down time I
buff, mana permitting, and I keep clarity up, and hastes if there is
no other haster. I use one of my calms, pacify an area.

I pull individual mobs with a tash spell, or using my blue band clicky
(choke), and I always have my pet up. As soon as the mob moves I move
behind the MA, and as the mob strikes me, my dual wield pet adds to
the DPS.

I watch the mobs as a med while it dies. If needed I mez adds or the
non-aggro healers. Since I pull, I can bring those next after
preparing them for death.

I know that mob aggro is the key, not important but KEY to killing
them fast and with minimal losses. A chanter is master of aggro. I can
add to the aggro, I can make the mob change targets, I can make it
lose it, and I can stop it altogether. Buffing, IMNSHO, is important
but not the most important job of an enchanter.

I like the Enchanter, I keep starting characters, and my chanter has
been around for a long time. I always go back, esp when I have too
much plat. I can rid myself of the excess plat by tradeskilling some
jewelry. :-)
