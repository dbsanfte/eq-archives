After Hours, or some signifigant portion thereof, is back
in business under the name Kryptic Rage. Tags came through on
Saturday, and I not only got Adastraea in on the ground floor, 
but Rabotev as well. Maybe they will make him a more efficient 
money farmer.
  Well, okay, money farming may be trivial when you have guildies
to form Seb groups with. But I regard all plat earned as a guild 
as going to the guild bank. I need my own sources, and if I'm 
just killing mobs for plat I might as well to hill giants and
geonids with everyone else. Better to make a bard and swarm in 
Dulak.
  First raid was tentatively scheduled for Sunday at 8pm. At
7:30, one of us reports strange activity in Rathe Mountains. Yup,
the GM's are at it again. How nice of them to give us something
to cut our teeth on.
  Guild leader Adminius is impressed with our assembly time. 
We get to the foot of the farming hill and I send an Eye of 
Zoom (er, Zomm; but it moves so *fast* sometimes) up to see
what the GM's are controlling: the Bloodbeard brothers, four
named cylopes. When everyone is gathered and buffed, and a 
few extra people join, we take them on.
  It's a fine, entertaining mess for about half an hour. Mass 
chaos, PvP-team style, four very powerful characters vs. two dozen
average ones. The cyclopes apparently have insane regen, except
one, whom we concentrat on and eventually take down. Then they 
all seem indestructible, until one of them loses regen and we 
pile on again. Maybe I should have thought sooner to cast Cancel 
Magic on them, hmmm. 
  This goes on until all four are down. The taunts and banter are 
great. When our resident monk gets near death someone inanely
tells the raid "Fd!" Uhh, not to belabor the obvious, but there's 
nothing artificial about the intelligence of THESE opponents, they
know when someone's a corpse or not. Loot is apparently from Chardok.
  We break up until the officers decide what else to do. About 
the only thing we can do, they figure, is more Kael; CoV faction
is holding us back. So, off to the Kael arena for more giant smooshing.
I make sure to get at least a pinprick spell against everything
for the faction hit; much of the time I'm medding when KEI wears 
off early, but I now know it's safe to cast Tears of Druzzil on 
them, my raidmates won't be hurt - just ME, if I get too close.
We do so well there that we decide to try Vindi. An extra group 
that wanted to xp joins us for the pull, and we do a small workshop 
on CH chains for our clerics. All in readiness, we pull Vindi.
He goes down on the first try, only a few deaths among us. One
of our melees gets a nice breastplate.
  Adminius is again impressed. He says Vindi is sort of a test
case for Tier 1 major mobs. We are ready to go quite far as we are,
and we're still working on getting people their epics, doing places
like Chardok and now ToV. Great things are ahead, hopefully.
