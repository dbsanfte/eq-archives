    No, I enjoy putting an end to this shit before it becomes a problem. The
only way to do that in EQ is to make a problem so widely known that VI is
forced to address it. Having munchkins train the people in the tunnel is a
good way to get attention.

    Imagine the ways this could be used that wouldn't get the BST in
trouble, but which would cause loads of grief. Pick a zone line, pull
animals to it, level buff them and zone. Keep going until the target zone
has a fair number of wandering, KOS level 47 mobs. Oasis, perhaps? Would
mess the zone up good, and nobody would have a clue what just happened. You
know how the aggro radius of a mob goes up with level, right? Mangler,
Rivervale. For the next ten hours there'd be a psychotic level 47 dog that
the guards would all assist - it would be like Fansy all over again.

    Now, let me even offer the solution: make it so charm spells and the BST
level buff don't stack. Then all a BST could do is charm a mob and give it
pet buffs, which is already a small problem. But leaving this as a curiosity
on the BST boards (where they're talking about it) means long-term potential
for problems.
