Any decent semi-auto rifle could do it in the hands of a trained military
marksmen of high quality.  Shooting 20 in 90 seconds isn't that big a deal,
it's the 15 in 12 seconds that's the challenge.

When I was shooting in single action western competitions there was an event
that required shooting 5 badguys, drawing a second weapon, and shooting 5 more.
 Those of us who were merely competent were shooting all 10 in 11-13 seconds. 
The winners, using single action revolvers (and fan firing would get you
disqualified), were doing it in 6-8 seconds.

It's not the weapon, it's the shooter.
