I have had 2-3 year old ask questions like the first 2.  I would agree that
for the 3rd question a child would more likely be closer to 4.  By the age
of 7 I would expect much much more complex questions than this.  If I child
is asking questions like my exmaples at the age of 7 I would theorize that
this child's parents had not been open with him/her about answering
questions that they may have, so they were asking elsewhere, or had simply
stopped caring to ask at all (both situations I find very sad).
