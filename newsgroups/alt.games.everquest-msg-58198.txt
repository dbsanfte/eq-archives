Hey, I got a port for the first time to Kunark yesterday and there were
loads of people in Dreadlands and comparatively few in FM where I was
headed.  What's so attractive about DL that it draws so many people?

And, in terms of loot, would it be better to stay in Kunark post 35, or
should I move my ranger to Velious?

Thanks
