I suspect a lot of EQ2's problems, "features", whatever, have to do with it 
evidently being rushed to marked long before it was ready.  I didn't 
participate in the beta, but I remember reading the accounts of several beta 
testers with great interest, particularly at how shocked several of them 
were that the game could be considered ready to ship when it did.

It appears that SOE felt like they had to get the game on shelves before 
WoW, a move that if true may have hurt more than helped.

If you need to email, then chainbreaker (naturally) at comcast dot
