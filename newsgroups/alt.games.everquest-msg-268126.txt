The raw materials are gained by harvesting in the tier 1 newbie zones.
Harvest rocks, roots, logs, anything sitting on the ground that highlights.
They're named differently in each zone, but they do the same things.

All other supplies are sold by the wholesaler in your tradeskill society, the
merchant at the bottom of the stairs.  There is a society in each town that
you can join, depending on where you like to do your crafting.
