As I understand it, their reasoning is that two (or more) people sharing 
an account can theoretically stay online pretty much 24/7 which means 
the account uses more server/cs resources than an account used by only 
person (who'd have to break to sleep occasionally, at least) would. And 
of course, they want to make more money on the deal. =P
