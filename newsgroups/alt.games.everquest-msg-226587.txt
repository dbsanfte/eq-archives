One of the elements some of the other folks have neglected to mention is
distance.  You need to keep a safe distance from the fight, safety defined
as enough distance to keep some reaction time for you to get a stun off.
Obviously, a slow moving mob (most undead) or a snared one decreases the
distance you need to keep between yourself and the fight.  This is what
makes duoing with a druid or ranger so convenient; keeping your charmed mob
snared is known as keeping a 'leash' on the pet and makes it much safer when
the time comes to re-charm.  It's great fun to snare and charm one guard in
HoH basement, then use it to attack a second one while a EQ/AM3 ranger
plinks away; or to team-charm with a druid (you charm anything, they charm
animals) and just chew through the mobs with a pair of hasted pets.

Personally I like to fight as far from the mobs as possible; it gives me the
greatest amount of time to react.  As has been said earlier, keeping your
target mob rooted is very useful when possible - but root breaks at the
damnest times.  Don't fight so far from the mobs as to pick up adds,
though -  while this limits where you can charm-fight, it's worth the safety
margin.

I've charm-fought in Chardok, Chardok B, Solusek C, PoN/I/V/S, BoT, CoD -
given the right setup and a good parnter, you can do it anywhere.

If you want to try it solo, one possibility is to do a Caller Quest in
Fungus Grove and get some Fungus Beast Glands.  Right-click snare is a great
tool!

If you want to chat about enchanter tactics in-game, look me up.
