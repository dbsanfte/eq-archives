This is where you're mistaken.
They want a token shaman presence for buffing that's it.  After that
they can camp out and return after the fight is over.

This is why high level shamans (level 60 shamans) are quitting in
droves.  They went from a true god class in pre-Kunark world to a buff
monkey in the post-Velious world.

I have exactly 6 shamans on my roster for my guild.  If I see more
than 2 at any raid I would be shocked.
