My 40 Shaman also makes Kilva's listering Flesh for my bazaar mule and I
always sell out (the 4 or 5 10-shots I have avaialable) within 2 selling
sessions.  Ant's, Blood of Wolf, Kilva's and Unlife Awareness are the only
one's that sell "well".  The Aquatic Haunting (Enduring Breath) and
AntiWeight (Levitate) will sell one or two if I am lucky.  I assume Kilva's
Skin of Flame will sell well, also.
