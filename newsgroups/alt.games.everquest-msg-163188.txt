I prefer getting the same people to group with me repeatedly.

Educate the group and make it clear who the main assist is. Make sure
you have a good hotkey for mezzing, I make one like this (assuming mez
is gem 6)

Mezzing a ( %T )
/cast 6
The %T is mezzed dont touch it!

and make sure that all have hotkeys set up like this

Assisting tanky_tank
/assist tanky_tank
Engaging a %T

The last line makes them announce who they are attacking!

While they are fighting the other mobs debuff and memwipe the mezzed
mobs. If the mez breaks they are less likely to attack you.

Explain that to them, repeat yourself. I made a hoy key to explain
this as well. If they complain boot them. I love it when a guy says I
can do what I want. "Yes, you can do what you want, go ahead and do it
elsewhere"
