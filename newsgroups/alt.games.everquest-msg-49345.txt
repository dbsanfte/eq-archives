Well, I don't toss around words I don't understand.

I'll be more impressed when you and those like you show some signs of a
decent level of reading comprehension skills.

For example, you might realize I've never said "Eq sucks, DAOC rulez".
Despite the fact so many seem to think I have.  I merely corrected bad
information posted on DAOC (gasp!) and that SOE was overreacting to the
release of DAOC with a ton of annoucements.   Somehow, the mental giants in
this group can't understand that doesn't mean I don't enjoy EQ (Even after I
directly tell them that I do.)

Also note that I can remember what word I typed four words back. Especially
when I'm trying to make someone else look dumb.

I eagerly await your revelation of said fallacy.
