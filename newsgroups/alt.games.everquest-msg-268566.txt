But, if it takes a crafter that much effort and time to make a poor
item...  And people aren't going to buy that poor item...
Make crafting not profitable? 

Or crafter has to charge so much for
their time and effort that it will be too costly for the buyers?
Either way, makes crafting difficult and low on reward...

As your skill raises, you should be able to make (if listed as very
easy) quality items on demand. So, you can sell it for a profit.
