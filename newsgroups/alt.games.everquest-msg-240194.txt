Martin's info agrees with what I've heard from reputable sources.

BTW, a scan of his credit card summary would not be useful.  Scammers are
smart enough to bill under a name that has no obvious connection to the
source from which they get your credit card.

Why are your defending known thieves?  Even without the accusation of credit
card stealing, they are stealing bandwidth to spam.
