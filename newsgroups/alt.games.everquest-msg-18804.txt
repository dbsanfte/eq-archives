Hope you have better luck than I did this weekend -
I just need my torch, so I went to Najena with my
35 mage.  After 100 magicians in 3 days, I saw 4
shovels and a stein.  I got 3 of my 4 pages of mastery,
but no torch.

I also died a couple of times trying to break Rathyl's
room alone (dangit, those mages are on 20 minute
spawn timers.  I was hoping to add the ones in that
room to the list.)
