exactly Biz, You have a very good name here in A.G.E and even you know
that there are not 100 people in here that are Sony/VI employees, Hell
only about 5 of you now what your talking about. And yes it is hard to
prove here. Like I said before I could post my W2 and Paystub but
still they would not believe.
Why do you think I used Holy Moses as a name, they didn'y believe him
aswell.

Your one of the smart ones Biz so don't judge me as false so quickly.
