   Oh, sorry I for the week's lag on this.  Just started a new job where I
work 10 hours a day, with an hour commute each way.  So I might miss more
and more threads like this...

  Not that it really matters.  I am not a guru.  I am a cut'n'paste
monkey.  I wrote a pretty small portion of the current FAQ.  Sorry, but
can't help.
