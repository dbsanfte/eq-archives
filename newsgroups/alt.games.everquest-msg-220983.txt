There really needs to be a 12-step program for bad movie lovers.  You could
even have specialized groups: BSFA (for bad Sci-Fi Anonymous), BRFA (Bad
Romance Flicks Anon, notice how it could be mistaken for barf),and BAFA (Bad
Action Flicks Anon).  Maybe they could even have HRA (Harlequin Romance
Anon), but you may need to worry about the piston heads who think it's an
AHRA meet.
