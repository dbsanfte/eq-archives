Yep. So far, that's what we've been doing. Everyone who has posted the
inevitable "A Sad Goodbye" note on the guild board has been wished the best of
luck and told to keep in touch.  Except we haven't gotten to the "some of them
come back because most of us are planeable" stage yet. :-(   I'm hoping that's
how it will work out, but man the high end drainage in the meantime is very
depressing. As for the alt situation, we've yet to ask anybody to remove their
alts (excpet a few assholes who were being *thrown* out, of course) but at least
one uberguild on Xev who is courting our 53 warrior has, as part of their
initiation rules, a requirement that you either delete all your alts or transfer
them into their guild. No split guild loyalties. I thought it was an idiotic
rule, but what would I know? I'm not uber nor even close.  They may fail with my
53 warrior friend, though. He's already distressed about the seemingly endless
list of fascist rules, requirements about how much time and when you *must*
play, how many raids you *must* attend per week to stay in, etc.
  For his sake, I hope that there's a slightly more "laid back" uberguild out
there for him.
