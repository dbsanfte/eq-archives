Yeah, because the whole reason I'm trying to escape into a fantasy
world is so that I can be repeatedly reminded of the grim reality that
I'm looking to get away from.

If I want to be reminded of what happened one year ago, I can:

(a) Turn on any one of the major networks between 4 AM 9/11 and 4 AM
9/12

(b) Walk out my front door, turn right, and look down Broadway to
where the towers used to be.

(c) Stop putting off programming the numbers from my old cell phone
into my new cell phone because I know that about twenty of the numbers
in there are for people who died a year ago.

I don't fucking need it from EverQuest. tyvm.
