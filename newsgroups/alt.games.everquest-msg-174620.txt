At my trial we had:

Paladin
Enchanter
Wizard
Ranger 
Rogue
Druid (me)

The first attempt failed because our paladin heard the random emote,
"The participants have been found....lacking" and thought we'd failed,
so she ended the trial.

On the second attempt, the chanter was out of position and got aggro
constantly. I used a fair bit of mana keeping him alive, and went OOM
with the Executioner at 20%.

The final attempt was a cakewalk. I was at 50m at the end.
