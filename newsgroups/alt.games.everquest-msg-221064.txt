   That's pretty much my style too.  I do have a biography for my main, and I do
stick to it while playing, but I certainly don't use the "thee's" and "thou's". 
For one thing I think I would stinketh at it, and secondly Teapray is the
equivalent of a high school drop out who ran away from home to hang with her
thug boyfriend.  About the only outwardly roleplaying she does is to defend her
marriage to Lenny (you might be surprised how often I get chewed out on FV over
this issue) and she has been known to get hysterical in guild chat when anyone
mentioned the prospect of going ogre hunting.

    With my alts I to have little differences in personality.  My gnome sk just
likes to have fun.  Dismembering things is fun.  My dark elf necro is a greedy
little thing that wants to buy the world some day.  Things like that.
