Well, level 52 has been educational for me.

See, I thought I knew how mage pets work.  But it turns out I don't know 
beans now that I'm 52.

Up to level 49, pets are fairly simple:

Earth pets have the most HP, but are easily hit and do only so so 
damage, plus they cast root.  Use them when you need root, or at best 
when you don't mind it.

Water pets have the second most HP and avoid getting hit a bit better, 
with a water focus they have the same HP as earth pets.  They also cast 
a DD nuke.  Use this a LOT, especially as a MT, but not if you need 
roots not broken.

Air pets have the third highest HP total but avoid getting hit best of 
all, with air focus they have same HP as water.  They also cast a no DD 
stun.  Great in groups where they aren't going to be MT, stun is sort of 
like slow in that it reduces mob damage output, plus it sometimes 
interrupts casting (sometimes because they don't time it well, so its 
just coincedence if it hits while mob is casting)

Fire pets have the worst HP total, equal to unfoccused air pet if 
focussed... but they both cast a DD nuke -and- cast a self DS thats far 
better than the mage casting them can put on them.  Make good MT if you 
can keep them alive, and in a group their DD seems to be better than 
water DD, meaning they have a higher damage output than the other pets.

Monster Summoning pets can be the best of the bunch, since they have the 
HP of an Earth pet but sometimes DS themselves like the Fire pet, and 
don't cast anything so there's no rooting nor root breaking going on. 
Only problem is this spell doesn't get replaced every spell level, so 
its only useful a few times in your carreer; MS I is good till you hit 
the next spell level, and then you don't get MS II till level 50.

Up until level 49 every spell level (well not level one, oddly the 
premier pet class doesn't start the game with pet spells, don't get them 
till level 4) you get all four pets each level (might have to do 
Research to get them, but they all exist).

However, starting at level 51, this changes.  Level 51 gets One pet: 
Vocerate Earth.  Since groups rarely want root, this means you still use 
MS II or one of the level 49 pets.

Level 52 gets Vocerate Fire: But here's where things get wacky.  Fire 
pet at 52 isnt' just a bigger version of the one at 49; instead he is a 
wizard.  Buffs himself up with steelskin and o'kiel's flickering flame 
and greater shielding or something, and when he fights he doesnt' just 
cast a simple DD, he has something with knockback, and conversations 
I've had in the AGE channel suggest he also snares (which would be good 
news) and Annuls... which would mean he's practically unusable; only 
groups which don't rely on casting anything on the mob but DDs will want 
him randomly removing stuff.  Remove root, snare, DOTs, slows, cripples? 
  Thanks but no thanks!  The knockback component of his DD alone is 
enough to rule him out on melee based battles as this sucks out big 
chunks of melee damage while the tanks play "find the mob"

I don't know but what my 51 earth pet also does wacky things while I'm 
not looking... he -seems- to act normally, but since his normal routine 
includes rooting, I dont' get to see him much.

I've heard that the Water pet has backstab skill.  Don't get one till 
54, but at that point I guess I'll have to worry more about positioning. 
  any other surprises from him?

How about the air pet, is he also wacky in some way I'm not prepared for?

Currently I'm using my MSII pet in 90% of groups, despite having two 
nominally better pets.  And the one pet I get requests for is the 49 air 
  pet; the one 49 pet I happen to not have.

Anyone have a source on HP, AC, DD, etc. on the various pets at all 
levels?  The HP part would be particularly interesting, the 51 earth pet 
costs me 300 mana instead of 200 mana, does it have half again as many 
hp?  Because for pet canni, the ratio of casting mana to HP is crucial. 
  I normally use my MS II pet to canni with, but could switch to 49 
earth or to 51 earth if that meant a better ratio.

Curse SOE for teaching me wrong for 50 levels!

Splendid One, 52 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
