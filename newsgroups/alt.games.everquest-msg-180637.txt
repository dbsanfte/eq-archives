I point you to a thread that I started on Monkly Buisness that was
about the same question:
http://makeashorterlink.com/?Q11D22073


a snip from the thread:
/snip on

At skill level 200 and below you heal 1 point for every 4 skill
points. So at 200 skill you would bind wounds for 50 points per
bandage.

200 and below formula: skill / 4 = healing per bandage

At skill level 201+ you heal 2 points for every 5 skill points. So at
a 205 skill you bind wounds for 82 points. 

201+ formula: skill / 5 * 2 = healing per bandage

I believe this is correct, and I don't know if the formula changes
again at higher skill levels. Please correct if I am wrong. 

/snip off

hope this helps you...
