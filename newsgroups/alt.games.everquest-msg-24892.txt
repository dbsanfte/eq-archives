You have summed up the problem with most mid level guilds perfectly.  I am
sure that you will get some good advice here about what I see as a common
mid-level guild problem.    I have the benifit of direct experience with
Jazz's guild and I have personally seen some of these high level players get
frustrated and leave.  A few weeks ago, I left his guild to join a friends
start up guild, but still retain ties to the old one.  There are two things
that I see as things that will retain members in your guild.

1.  Leadership, I do think that good leadership will help your guild.  My
humble experience is that in the past, your guild has lacked active
leadership.  Your guild leader is a very kind hearted person, but seemed to
me, lacked authority and direction.  Since I learned a week ago that you
were now an officer, Jazz, I knew that you would start turning things
around. I hope you can force participation in guild activities.

2. Interguild grouping.  Loyalty and friendships must be made strong by
grouping with each other OFTEN.  This means sometimes getting no exp just to
go group with a guildy on a boring camp.  Or it means running halfway across
norrath to group with some guildies even though you could do fine where your
at.

The above are the only two small problems I had with your guild while I was
a member.  I stress that I saw them as small problems and I would not
hesitate to rejoin your guild if the new one I am in, can't get off its
feet.  In fact, I had the most regrets of leaving, after learning you were
made an officer, LOL. oh well.

One more thought...   Jazz, You are one of the most dedicated EQ players I
know.  I don't mean playing 24/7, but I mean you have the determination to
play your character to the high levels, get your epics, and kill the uber
mobs.  I also feel that your play is some of the most professional I've seen
as you always seem to have researched and planed for each encounter you are
in.  So, I have to ask this... What happens in a few weeks when you are in
the 50's?  Are you going to stay in your guild and deal with the same
frustration of the others who had left?  It seems to me, loyalty aside, that
leaving a mid level guild when you are too high, is actually the right thing
to do in some situations.  This would allow you to advance at your pace.
The other, lower level players will be able to advance at there own pace
too.  Eventually, they will join you in the upper levels and maybe join your
new guild or you could form a new upper level guild. Just some thoughts.

I do like the suggestion about keeping the alts in the lower guild.
Broadens the friend base and in all honesty, a level 20 alt is out of place
in a 55-60 level guild anyway.

Sorry for the ramblings and,
Sincerely, Good luck.

your friend and former guildmate...

Orlun, 40th rogue, XEV (nervous new member of the upstart guild "Bearers of
Fate")
