    The didn't fix it - they banned fearing anything in the zone. They've
yet to fix the pathing as far as I understand it. I'm unhappy with this
"fix" because fear kiting in PoJ was something I wanted to try in the next
few levels, and I wouldn't have used an exploit to do it - never have and
never will.

Cheers,
James
