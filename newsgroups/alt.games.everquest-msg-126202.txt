Just to clarify his answer a little more.  You can "con" (consider) a MOB a
couple of ways.  You can click on it and then hit the "C" button on your
keyboard, or as Andrew suggested simply right click the MOB.  Some text will
show up in your chatbar that says something like "An Orc Pawn glares at you
threateningly.....ready to attack.  He looks like quite a challenge but you
might win"

The writing will be in color.  Depending on what color the writing is, you
will know whether to try to attack this MOB or not.  The colors are in order
from lowest (easiest) to highest:

Green (No experience-Far below you in level)
Light Blue (Minimal Experience-Still pretty far below you in level)
Dark Blue (Experience-A few levels below you)
Black/White (for some people it is black, for others white I dont know
why-Good Experience-even with you in level)
Yellow (Very Good Experience-A few levels of experience above you)
Red (Great Experience if you can take it-Watch out!-something red can be as
few as 3-4 levels above you or much as 20-30 levels above you-no telling)

Also, just to let you know.  Soon you will hear people talking about
faction. Faction means how much you are liked or hated by a particular group
within the game. The same "con" message is what you use to find out.  In the
above example you would be KOS (Kill On Sight) to the Orc.  If an evil race
(Dark Elf, Iksar, Troll or Ogre) sees this message from a guard, they better
not head into town.  Other faction messages are dubiously, apprehensively,
warmly and amiably.  I'm not sure what the order is.
