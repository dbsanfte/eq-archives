Yes, I can.  Where's my straightedge?  Anyway, the socratic method, 
"teaching by asking rather than telling"  has not been very popular in 
American education, yes, so why do you choose to point it out as a failing 
of Islamic education?  I would not be suprised if many of those who do 
graduate able to read haven't had a 'socratic' education, either.

The socratic method also means a variety of other things, depending on who 
exactly you ask.  But I'd be suprised if you could justify saying that 
-any- of them are absent from an Islamic education.

No, I woudn't be suprised if the Iraqi (or the Afghani, for that matter) 
educational situation is not in top form, considering those countries have 
been pretty heavily bombed in the last decade, and then there's trade 
embargoes... They probably have some problems that their society -might- 
prioritize over education, like surviving.  But that's a tiny fraction of 
the Islamic world that you've chosen to condemn as illogical.

Yes, graduate students are a bit ahead of the unwashed masses.  But they 
had to get there somehow.  What, are you suggesting they self-taught 
themselves biochemistry from books by candlelight when they could break 
away from religious studies class for a moment?  That they were 
miraculously divinely inspired with a knowledge of how the Krebs cycle 
works, not to mention enough grasp of english to explain it to an 
American?  Or are you suggesting that they must have somehow snuck into 
western schools as a child, despite having been in a completely differet 
country?
