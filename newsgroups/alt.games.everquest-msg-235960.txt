Rangers, do they solo???  Surely you mean rangers do they group?  Can
be very hard to find a group as a high level ranger.  Isn't helped by
some rangers who "practise my bow skill" in LDoNs and basically act
like idiots.

I have a Level 55 hobbit ranger, who has grouped about three times in
his life. Most of the time, I play my main in groups.  But when my
guildies aren't on, I solo my ranger.

The experience is so-so but there's no faffing around getting a group
together or waiting for people to get KEI's or return from going LD
etc.  So in the end it works out about the same.

I'm not sure that the opportunities for soloing above 55 are that
good.  A lot of JP is now LBlue to me.  Have switched to AA's so the
top-end animals can stay dark blue a little while longer.  But soon I
might have to start grouping.

Unless anyone knows where a ranger can solo above 55?  Please append
:)

For information (and from less than perfect memory) my ranger soloed
mostly in...

Level  1-10(?) Field of Bone 
Level 11-18(?) Kurn's tower (I detest Paludal Caverns!)
Level 19-20(?) Marus Seru 
Level 21-30(?) Stonebrunt Mountains
Level 31-43(?) Dawnshroud Peaks
Level 44-45(?) Dreadlands
Level 46-55    Jaggedpine Forest

Hope this helps
