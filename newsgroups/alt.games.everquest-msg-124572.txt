Oh, it's not that hard. I can get 1 blue in less than 2 hours - in 59.
As for AA, I did half a level just before dinging 58 and then
completed the level (for run 1) just before dinging 59. Since some of
the mobs in my exping spot turned light blue a 58 and 59,
respectively, I decided to milk a little more dark blue exp from them
before dinging. (Oh, and that 1 blue+  in 2hr thing is in that same
spot with half dark blue, half light blue)
