Deep.  Use the regular enterence in hobbit land.  Keep going straight, not
towards the elevators, since the underbulks down there are too low level.
You'll pass foyer of sorts with three underbulks, then a T.  Take the right
branch, and you get to a room with Fiends, bulks, and grabbers, and undead
further on.  Keep going straight, instead, and you get to the Fireclaw room.
