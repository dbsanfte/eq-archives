Waste of time,if you ask me,just buy some sow potions,
and if you dont solo a lot there is always a sower in group.
Lately leveled my oldest char,a cleric,from 29 to 65,first
purchase I did was a box with 10 sow potions,guess what,
at 65 I have 7 sow potions left.So at a going price of 90 for
one,Run3 would have saved me exactly 246p,lol.
