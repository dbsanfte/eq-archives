The first floor is the only one where you can walk back out the way you came
in. If you saw several mobs there, then they had recently been pulled there by
people fleeing the zone.  Nothing spawns in that corridor, and all the mobs on
that floor stay in fixed positions with no wanderers. On subsequent floors,
turning back around at the point where you teleport in will show you only a
blank wall. Very disconcerting for the first exploerers there, I imagine.
