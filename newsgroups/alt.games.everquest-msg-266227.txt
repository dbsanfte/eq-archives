Read your history. The war of independance was not an election campaign 
promise from the "Indepedane America Party"

Maybe your a dummy too. :)

Seriously though: he's easily misled, lacks common sense, and hell, 
without his handlers around, he lacks leadership qualities too. He's a 
cute little puppet.

>   Get real.  The man holds two Ivy League degrees. 

The hard part about getting an Ivy League degree is two fold: 1) getting 
into the Ivy League, and 2) paying for it.

#1 can be bought, and #2... well, that by definition is a function of 
money. Intelligence isn't really a factor. And once your in, your in... 
the Ivy League is pretty generous with its A's and honours... and pretty 
stingy with its F's and expulsions.

IQ is a pretty disputed standard for measuring intelligence.

Go Tom!

Hard to say. Give a man the worlds superpower's army and you sort of 
have pretty high expectations. Has the war on terror been a 'success'... 
I don't think so... but then I don't think Bush is waging a war on 
terror at all... that's just a convenient excuse.
