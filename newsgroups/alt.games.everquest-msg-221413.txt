The pieces for your 44 spell drop in Dulak, not Gunthak, off
"treasure sorter"s and "storage attendant"s (find a spoiler and
make sure I'm not misremembering the mobs' names).  You'll want a
group, they are not common drops.  On the plus side the mobs do
drop an occasional gem (including diamonds and blue diamonds) so
at least your gorup will get some loot.  Be sure you keep track
of which piece you get first (i.e. which mob dropped it) as the
two pieces cannot be told apart except via identify (you need one
drop from each kind of mob).  The spell can be MQ'd, but only by
another Druid.  You do want the spell, it's the only instant heal
upgrade you get between L29 and L51.
