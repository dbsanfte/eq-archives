Those lovely folks at Verant removed the hilt mold from Freeport when
they redid many vendors a while back.  So now you can do many things
in FP that formerly you could not (bowmaking for instance) but you
can no longer make a skinning knife with local materials.  After all,
why would you need a skinning knife in the FP area?  It's not like
there're any pelt bearing animals in the vicinity.  One location
I know for the mold is Kelethin (vendor in unmarked hut next to the
female vendor who does the Banded Orc Vest quest, near Trueshot Bows).

Try eqtraders for more info.  There was a thread on their discussion
board lamenting the disappearance of the hilt mold from FP, dunno if
that thread is still around, but it was mildly amusing reading a while
back.
