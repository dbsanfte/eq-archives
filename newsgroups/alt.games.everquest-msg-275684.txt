You have a point.  Some windows have changed over the years but the
size and position often didn't.  My spell gem often ar epartly
obstructed by another window and has been since the 9th slot was added
with OoW.  Raid box were so squashed by default it would seems to be
broken.  And the option is hiding advanced button. =P
