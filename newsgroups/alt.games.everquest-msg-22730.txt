It certainly is annoying... but I can see the thinking.

We've been pulling fine without a cleric.  Now we have those
added heals at our backs.  Why would we want to stop the
exp gravy train?

Further, we just added a new member.  Now we need to pull
at least 1/5th again as many mobs per hour just to break even
(smaller groups even more so) and taking a five minute break
isn't going to help that.

Too, this camp is broken.  We need to pull each mob as it
pops so we don't have to go thru the hell that breaking the
camp again implies.

Other possibilities:  This cleric is replacing our last cleric, we
are already buffed up, and will tell him as our buffs fade.  Don't
need -his- buffs, per se, we aren't trees that he has to piss on
to mark his territory.

============================================
Those all strike me as valid reasons to pull on arrival... but
here are the qualifiers:

Any time anyone joins a group, there is basic information that
needs to be shared.  Everyone should give class and level,
for example.  If there is a paladin who is addicted to using his
DW helm for heals, he needs to tell the cleric right away that
he doesn't want his HP buff, as valor or resolution will prevent
Daring from sticking.  Who is pulling, who is the main assist.
Paladins, is LOH available, Monks, is Mend available?

Too, what are we killing and is there anything special about
them I might need to know... for example, this mob is stun/mes
proof, or that mob explodes in an AOE on death, or this
third one is a caster... has HT?  Needs to have buffs cancelled
off?  Don't assume that the new group member knows the mobs
unless you've fought in that spot with him before... and don't
assume that just because you've been handling things one
way that he doesn't have something in his arsenal that wouldn't
make the fights a lot easier if he knows what's going on.

Finally, Mana levels.  Noone should ever pull without a mana
check unless you really don't need the casters/healers at all...
funny thing, quite often when I get to a party my mana is quite
low, be a nasty surprise if you think you are getting a fully
charged up healer and pull something big.

While this extremely basic meet and greet is going on, I"m slapping
resolution on every party member in range, and will hit the
puller with it when he gets back if they are that fast off the mark.
The AC buff will go on the designated MA if I can afford it,
or maybe that will have to wait till things get under control.  If
its a constant pull group probably symbol is unnecessary, and
at any rate its going to have to wait until we are a fight or two in
to the business and I've been able to see who is getting most of
the love, and what level of symbol is warranted... besides, I won't
be able to afford to buff everyone all at once if we are in constant
pulls, I'll want to spread them out so they don't all go off at once,
forcing another "I wish they'd give me five minutes to redo all that"
moment.
