Not really silly, I hope. My point here is that porting is a discriminating
ability that the druid class has. It is what separates them from most other
caster classes. This is the crucial point I wanted to emphasize. Clerics who
couldn't heal could still Rez/Buff/nuke undead, etc. Making them not 100%
useless, buy severely hurting their class.

Aye - but its hard to Nuke when the MOB is beating on you. Mages come
equipped with their own Tank. Groups also like them for that CoH thing -
that only they can do.

True enough, but never the less it reduces the need for druids in groups.
Snare/root is also essential for a Druid to solo - which is not necessarily
bad if they had PROMOTED grouping, rather than dissuading it.

I am complaining that they have denied a major feature of the class in a
vast portion of the game, not that I can't get experience. For some players,
getting experience is not the sole goal of the game, but having fun is. In
my case, contributing to groups is fun, and so is just helping folks by
porting them around.

Once again, you are correct, but still off point. Druids have not been made
completely useless, just less useful. BTW, the spells you mention are
obtained at 58 level +, now if they made 900pt heals available at 50 ....

Aye, but now it has just been made true in about 30% of the whole game, and
100% of the new portion.

I will be happy to recheck the players guides, etc., but I am nearly certain
that none of them warned me they are creating another 30 zone world where
porting is not possible. I still may have chosen a druid, but I certainly
did not expect this would happen at the time I created the character.

But why make the situation WORSE for druids that do like to group? Luclin
has been very beneficial to almost every other class, friggen Centi weapons
are a dime a dozen now. 12 damage rogue piecers drop like candy. The stats
on Luclin gear is nearly as good as some epics! The Nexus portals alone are
a blessing to all other classes but Wizards and Druids. This is why I say
druids have received the brunt of "balancing" with Luclin.
