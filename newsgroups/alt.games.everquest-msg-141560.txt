Along with the other good suggestions, I'll add:

   /part off      (turns off particle effects, which can *really*
                  lag some video cards.  This makes a world of
                  difference for me on/near the elemental island in
                  Twilight Sea, too)

   /showspell off    (similar to the above, but handles a different
                     group of visual effects)

   /hidecorpse all     (there are often a ton of corpses
                       lying around the PvP area of the
                       Bazaar.  Even if you can't see them,
                       the rendering engine has to consider
                       them, even if just to eventually decide
                       to ignore them -- every single frame)

   /viewport 0 0 400 300    (this reduces the "view" window
                            size, effectively dropping
                            your rendering resolution temporarily
                            and drastically dropping the number
                            of pixels that have to be rendered
                            each frame.  Going from a full screen
                            1024x768 to this setting reduces your
                            video load by a factor of 6.5.  To
                            go back to full screen, "/viewport reset")

   Look down.  Even if you don't stare right at your feet, angling
   your view downward a bit will allow you to see PCs in your
   general vicinity, but prevent you from having to also render the
   50 characters 100 feet down the aisle.

   And if you're not /bazaar'ing, wouldn't it be nice to have
   a /hidetrader command?  It's a pain to have to bank now
   with those 345 bozos in view who insist on forming a human
   pyramid of Traders on the four square feet of real estate
   *right* beside the bank.

   When I set up my Trader for the night, I politely do it
   in the *back* of the Bazaar, near the Arena hallway.
