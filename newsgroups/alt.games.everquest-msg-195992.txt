If this is the same buff clerics get, the trick is to time it; cast just before
a fight, and then halfway thru its normal duration, if the fight looks to go on
for a bit longer, cast it again.  This refreshes the buff, putting you back at
max strength.  Of course this is an unending cycle, as your STR keeps dropping
back to your base until you are ready for a rest, then you just stop casting it
and let it run out its negative course.  If it was a free clicky with a short
cast time, there wouldn't even be a mana cost associated with doing this, only
thing holding me back from reccomending it without qualification would be that
cast time; if used as I describe you will be clicking in combat, which means
time not swinging.  If its a -very- short cast time then you could click it even
more often, keeping your str up towards the high end of the cycle all the time.
