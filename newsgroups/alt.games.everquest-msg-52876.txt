Why would I waste time and energy to do that when blind wears off in 18
secs.  While you're root/blinding the pet, I've already gotten by first set
of shock/shock/nuke on you.  My usual method is shock/shock/nuke until I run
out of mana.  If I'm on a lvl where the bigger nuke is the other shock
spell, it'll be three shocks in a roll.

Leaving yourself open to my nukes again.

But while you're splitting your attention between me and the pet, I've been
hitting you and the pet can still cast his wind spell while rooted and blind

I've duelled a lvl 30 druid and he didn't step through (I was lvl 28 then).
But I'm not sure how far back the spell hits you relative to the level of
the pet.

Yes, but I've got two going at you simultaneously.

I'm sure.

There's always that risk.  But my money is still on the pet caster.
