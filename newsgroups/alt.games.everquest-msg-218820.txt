In part it will depend on how far you expect the guild to go, raid 
encounter wise.  In general though, the warrior will be able to allow you 
to take on some encounters sooner than you would be able to with an SK or 
Paladin as the MA, assuming all else is the same.  Against unslowable 
mobs, or even some of the serious slowable ones, the warrior with 
defensive will make it easier to do the encounter.  It is certainly 
possible, with the right equipment, to use a paladin or sk instead 
against most, if not all, pre PoP targets, and many of the lower tier PoP 
targets as well.  For that matter, even lesser types have been used to 
tank some raid level encounters that used to pretty well require a 
warrior.

For our raiding, we use both knight classes and warriors as the MA, just 
depends on the specific encounter, and, who is available.  The mobs we 
are doing are Vindi, Xanamech, IV, Rumblecrush, Lcea for a few examples.
