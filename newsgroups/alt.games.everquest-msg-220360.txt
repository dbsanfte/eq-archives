No, one successful taunt is all it takes.  The success of the taunt is 
based on a variety of factors, taunt skill level, level of the mob, 
amount of hate to be overcome.

Regardless, what he reported is that the /assist check for taunt having 
worked did not work for him.  I would guess it is because he was sitting, 
although, I would have thought that would be taken into account with the 
/assist testing of taunt, it may not be.
