Only if you're a retard. If all steamfont was were those caves, it
would be a dungeon, because those caves are a mini-dungeon, but the
zones don't have code for exp bonus in one part but not another.

So, now that we've established you're just arguing for the hell of it
rather than from a logical base, do you have anything else to offer?

It's amazing how far afield people with chips on their shoulder will
go. Arguing that Netherbian Lair isn't a dungeon... LOL
