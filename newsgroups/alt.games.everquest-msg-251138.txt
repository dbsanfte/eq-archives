You could still do this. Get a couple mind controllers with Mass Mez and some
single-target damage types (scrappers are best for this). With a couple
recharge DOs + sleep duration DOs, most mobs will sleep longer than Mass
Mez takes to recharge, and with both controllers cycling at slightly
different points, you're pretty much guaranteed to keep the whole group
locked down. If any get wriggly, the controllers just dominate it. And
the scrappers just hack, hack, hack and watch the XP and influence roll
in. On the occasions when something doesn't go according to plan, well,
that just spices it up a bit. Talk all you want, pausing occasionally to
fire off powers.

So there you go - you can do the same thing in CoH with the right
builds. If that's your thing, anyway.
