And how did all of *them* get flagged? My point is, at some point,
people had no higher levels to help them through the trial, yet they
managed. Other people can to. For a person to refuse to try the trial
without someone carrying them and, worse, to begrudge those who, for
whatever reason, won't carry them, is just ridiculous.
