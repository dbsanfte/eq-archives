Folks pointed you to the website so I'll add a few suggestions:

- You'll want to change the Alpha and Fade level of the map window.  Windows
default to 100% when the cursor is on it (alpha) and 50% when the cursor is
elsewhere (fade).  Change both of these values to 50 or 40 and you'll likely
be able to see much more of the map, since most zone walls don't show up
very well (if at all) when the map is at 100% alpha.

- Kill the Height Filter button.  Although it's sometimes handy to have on
(complicated dungeons), outdoors it serves no purpose except to hide stuff
higher & lower than you.  It's a big button on the right, you can't miss it.
:)   If you'd like the game to remember your preferences, please send
/feedback.

- If you have a scroll mouse you can easily zoom in & zoom out.  That comes
in VERY handy when you're trying to find the shortest way across a zone.
You can also do it without a scroll mouse (using the zoom buttons).

- Work on Sense Heading!!  When you get to a certain skill (I think around
170) the "+" marker turns into an arrow.  It's not a huge issue but I find
it very handy.

Note: apparently some zones CANNOT be mapped.  I found Plane of Fear and
Ssra Temple are two of those zones.
