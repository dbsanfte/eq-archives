Nah, the 4200 and next one up is meant to be around the geforce 3
level. The MX ones are meant to be around the geforce 2 level and
price. The 4200 one at $199 is a full geforce 4 with 128 meg ram and
not a bad deal reall, while the best one was $399? Or 299? mixed up
now ;)

Geforce 4 is just a move to be NOT deceptive I think and move all the
cards under one name line (geforce 4) Looking at the types of geforce
4 and the prices it was much clearer to me which card type it was than
say the current geforce 2 Mx, ultra and some other kind.
