I'm curious. How? Aura of battle on... belt, ring, sleeves, warders protection,
natures precision, primal, swiftwind....  Are we still talking when COP and 
everything stacked through buffing exploits? I am not sure I see how they were

If I'm forgetting to ask for buffs that my groups could use to increase their
damage output I'd love to know about it.
