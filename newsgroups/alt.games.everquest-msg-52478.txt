No, it's not an attempt to "shrug us off". Every single one of the
"may not be reimbursed" ( Notice a lot of the changes only changed
"will not" to "may not". There is a huge difference there, you know...
) is a situation that cannot really be proved except in a few rare
cases, and those that can be proved require so much time and effort it
would keep the GMs' from helping too many other players. Yes, in that
case, it is a way to save time - like it or not, they're time is more
too valuable to spend hours on one person when they've got 1500+ other
people who may need help.
