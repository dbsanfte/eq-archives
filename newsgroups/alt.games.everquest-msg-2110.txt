This was not a fluke. It happened to my guild last time we tried Fear.

The problem (according to "GM Useless" of Veeshan) is that if 18+ people
come in at once it can crash the zone.

We had tried reducing the initial attack to two groups and it still crashed
on us. GM's would not help us until 5+ hours later and 3 crashes  later. By
this point when we had called in other guilds to help us and had cleared
Fear. Just after we finished all 18+ rezzes  the clueless GM cames along and
says "ok ill help now - who need rez".  He's been known as GM Useless ever
since.

Fear sucks.
