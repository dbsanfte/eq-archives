Right - But I usually class that under xp to level:

The xp to get through a level is/was:

Level^3 * 1000 * RM * CM * LM

Where:
RM = racial modifier (.95 for halflings, >1 for iksar, trolls, ogres
and I don't know who else)
CM = Class modifier (.95 for warriors IIRC.  Before the "removal"(*)
of hybrid penalties it was 1.1 for int casters, 1.4 for rangers,
bards, sk's and pallys)
LM = Level Modifier(**) 

(*) I put removed in quotes because they apparently just gave these
classes an xp bonus to offset the penalty.
(**) Before the smoothing it was 1.1 at 30, 1.2 at 35 etc.  There is still 
some sort of level modifier, but I don't know the exact way to compute it
