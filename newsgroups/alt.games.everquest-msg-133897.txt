Actually 98SE is even worse, both operating systems give root access to 
ever program and open the Netbios port per default (which is basically the 
first thing a script kiddie tries on a windows box). The problem is that 
win98 additionally has lots of security leaks which will never be patched. 
(XP will reach that state around 2004-2006 whenn Palladium shall take over)
