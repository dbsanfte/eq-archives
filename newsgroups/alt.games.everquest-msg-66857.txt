It's true.  Verant really screwed a lot of players with their new
release.  It's probably mildly theraputic for you to vent.  But the
fact of the matter is you will all fall in line with whatever scheme
Verant chooses to implement.

You really are in their world now.  They could...

- Raise the monthly fee for the game
- Ignore any bug they don't feel like spending time on
- Release patches that require you to upgrade you computer
- Require on-demand fellatio in your home at any time of their
choosing

...and you would all fall in line with their demands.

That's what addicts do.

And that's what you are.

Some of you may actually cancel your account.  Some of you may
actually uninstall the game from your computer.  But the fact of the
matter is you'll all be back to suck the bittersweet bile from the
teet of Verant.

There's no free choice here...
