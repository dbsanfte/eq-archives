My ignore list is much more diversified.  A monk and a bard for horrible
pulling.  The druid that was using /tell to badmouth the other teammates, which
I felt wasn't warranted.  The warrior who admitted his Dad twinked and
powerleveled his character to 40, let him join the guild, then dumped him on
the Norrathian public like a juvenile delinquent with absolutely no skills or
knowledge of his character.  A froglock who tried to run off with the goods -
his guild was quite helpful in locating him.  Oh and a chanter who just had a
really bad attitude all the time, like he was doing us a favor just by playing
with us.
