That's exactly what I said in that earlier thread: the world HAS gotten
bigger, but the number of people in it hasn't grown to match, so people
are spread more thinly.  Retuning content can't fix the problem, unless
retuning includes eliminating large chunks of it, which is probably not
the right answer either.
