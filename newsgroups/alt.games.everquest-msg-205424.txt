Ever since the "fix" to the lull-line, places like Chardok are now pretty 
much cake since you can prevent the adds - assuming you aren't idiots.  The 
lack of a snarer ( well you had a druid, but they didn't know how to heal 
so snare may be a little much to ask of them. . . ) would scare me the 
most.  But, the rogue had a serrated bone dirk (?) right?  At worst, 
there's always root.

But, you know all this crap, I'm just rambling.  Chardok is not a place for 
a clueless group.  The Chanter probably hadn't even bought Pacify.

I was in a pick-up group in PoN when I was about level 53 and the warrior 
pulled 2 spiders right off.  Mez resist right off and now I have a spider 
mad at me.  I start running down the wall to get some distance for a 2nd 
mez or a tash and typing: /g ROOT IT  /g ROOT IT

The warrior starts chasing after me screaming at me to stop running.  I 
finally get it rooted, tashed, then mezzed and he's still babbling about 
how he has no idea how I could get to level 54 ( I was 53 ) if I'm going to 
run from the mobs instead of letting him taunt them off of me.  During this 
time, the bard, ranger, and druid didn't do a thing ( snare, root, chains, 
etc ) except assist on his mob.  The idea of a chanter running to create 
space so he can do his job was pretty foreign to this guy.

As if a warrior is going to be able to taunt a spider in PoN off of me 
before I die.  PoN != Orc Highway
