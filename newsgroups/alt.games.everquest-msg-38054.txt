Strange as it feels to defend Bizbee, I just had to add a "me too"
to this one.

Whatever his faults and motivations, being a VAK is *definitely*
not one of them, and I'm boggled that anyone could come to
the conclusion that he was.

Hint:  The fact that he sometimes rags on people who bash
Verant doesn't make him a VAK, especially since he also rags
on people who defend Verant.
