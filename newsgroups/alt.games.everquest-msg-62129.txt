As a level 8 enchanter, I am wearing cloth. Would like to upgrade. Have
always played warrior types and am unfamiliar with caster armor. What is the
next, affordable upgrade and where can I find it? What can I expect to pay
for the upgraded items (cloth cape, cloth arms and pants, cloth shoes, cloth
wristbands, etc.)
