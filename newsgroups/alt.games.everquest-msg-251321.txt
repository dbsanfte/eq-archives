So you're saying that if I don't have time to get into a group and
want to play a few minutes go some where else? Tuff, I'll play the way
I want as long as I don't hurt others. If you don't like it that's
your problem. I like to chat with friends that are playing characters
of a level that I can't group with so I guess I'll solo when I have to
and all of the others like me will too. Funny, SOE doesn't require
grouping so get over it.

Oh, I pay for my monthly account and joined this open news group along
with the OP so guess what, If we want to bitch, we will. If you don't
like it filter us. I don't play the high end and I also don't bitch
when the high end players play or post.
