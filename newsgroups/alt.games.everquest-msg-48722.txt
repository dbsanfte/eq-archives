Well, Dark Age of Camelot is finally out and I'm going to
bid a fond farewell to EQ.  Most of what made EQ fun
is my relations with other people in the game.  Outside
of the social aspect, EQ is an ok game... but it really
does lack substance beyond hack-and-slash.  I mean,
truthfully, Old Seb is no different that Lower Guk which
is no different than Upper Guk which is not much 
different that Innothule Swamp or even the 3 Froggies
in the Qeynos sewers.  It's all the same thing only
harder.  Players become more powerful as they level,
but monsters become a SHITLOAD more powerful.
At any rate, most of my guild mates are leaving to
play DAoC and I'm going with them.  DAoC looks
very promising and I will welcome the change

Sayonara!
