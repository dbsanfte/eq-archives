Pff behave? ...

Yes i am aware, and they also display the date and time, which post on which
news group it was, from who etc..
and that for years behind.

All the newsgroup i have posted are all newsgroup im subscribed, and as you
can see from google result , i havent gone mad at all by posting hundreds of
annoying post. One single post on my favorite newsgroups. You probably read
them to see if they was others like you that didnt like my post and came up
to the conclusion that probably only you Started the bitching and only on
this newgroup i had trouble.

The guy from that pool site is probably curious with why he is receiving
email from a EQ newsgroup if its the case,  because of a guy nicknamed
Phreakhack mentioned his record attempt in newsgroup. It will give him
something to read if he subscibe to this newsgroup to see what i wrote.

It wont make me stop posting about EQ here. It wont make other Users stop
sending me emails for tips or games. Just like i will keep posting in Linus
newsgroup
etc.. I bet you also noticed that it was the first time i ever posted a off
topic event in newsgroup. Go back 6 years ago if you want i dont care.

Christ i posted in newsgroup i use like related to Linux and Html.  NOT a
single complaint nor a single "Flame" As a sysadmin im subscribed also on
php newsgroup, mysql, etc... If i post there cause i want to share the info
i have interest in with others, if they are not interested they will not
read my post , not even once. Here on Everquest, I got lot of replies here
because of the "Flame" or else my post would have stayed just with maybe 3
or 4 replies. I may had to change quickly the name in the info box so try to
start and converstation on the topic and see what other think.

By the way the only reason why i promoted that event was that the guy comes
from the same city. that is it.

You prove your point. I made mine.

Everquest remains a cool game like i said, and if there is another event
that gets me excited and feel to share it, i will have to remember my dear
friend Dark Jedi and few others doesnt like post that are not related to EQ
and that they will behave the same way.

But you dont need to be god to get my IP. Just open outlook express and view
the header. If its forged, you can always track the source still if you know
how.
you can get quick basic info you would find in any email header.The rest
with and IP Tracer or any other tools such as tjping etc.. you can figure
out the rest my following the usual steps.But we all know that.

  quick example of email header

And yes, i called my ISP, and warn him the first day you accused me of
spamming.
Like i said i have been a client there for years i have very good relations
with the company, never did somethig wrong.
Im not a spammer, and what the f##k spams brings anyway?? Its useless,
unless the
spammers own the site or gets 2Cents a hit. Damn! no thank you i rather play
EQ or BDGII. or go ski or something.

Thanks to you all for sharing your thoughts about The pool event, The
Spamming,

I would like to say special thanks to the Judge and the jury.

Ok, im a bit tired now of these replies, (Yawn!) im letting that little boat
go. Feel free to keep it alive if you want.
Since you have my IP, if you want to still discuss about this, stop replying
here, just send me a email, which is what you should have
done in the first place.

Like that you can still explain yourself and tell me to behave,  and that
post will not end up with 100 of replies. I shall
do my part my stopping the nagging game of who is right and who is wrong.

Wow i think i broke my own record for the longest post.
