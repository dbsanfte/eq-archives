    They didn't post drops for Aaryonarr, so I assume they cleverly avoided
wasting time killing any dragons. Emerald Templars is on Dragon faction, so
I seriously doubt they killed anything on the way up.

    And don't forget the armour. I looked at the cleric armour set from PoM.
Same AC as Kael, within a few points (one last piece was undiscovered when I
checked the list). Better stats, including WIS. Better HPs/MANA. Better
total resists. What did it lack? Right-click effects. Oh, no, I can't get
Abundant Food and Drink! As a cleric, that armour list convinced me that
I'll never need to be on Giant faction. Before, there was an AC tradeoff
with Kael vs. Skyshrine - not any more.
