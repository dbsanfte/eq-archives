I have not yet figured out the mechanics of this, but, sometimes I touch
down long before KC.  I don't stop, I don't look down.  It seems like when
it's raining and I can't see things, I levitate much farther.  When it's
clear, and I can see everything, I am lucky to make it past the mountainous
part of DL without touching down.  One thing to keep in mind for nongating
classes.  If you try this, and you end up landing inside the KC building,
you will not zone into KC, and there is no way out of the building without
gating, or getting someone to port you out.
