Right, or repackage it and sell it as "Classic Monopoly" or
whatever.  To use another example:  you buy a book.  You
can sell the book if you want.  And that person can sell it
and so on.  But neither you nor anyone else can take that
book and sell chapters from it as part of a "Classic Chapters"
collection without permission from the copyright holder.

Back to EQ:  I think Sony would have issues enforcing
their ban on account selling.   The purchaser owns that
account key, etc.   But selling items *from* that account?
I don't think Sony would have any problems enforcing
they're the only ones who can do that.  *shrug*
