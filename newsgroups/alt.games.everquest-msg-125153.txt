Well, you still should be careful with cross-posting, *especially* if you
do it to annoy people you don't like. We've got a name for people who do
that, you know... ;D

On A.G.E? Sure. And the group is pretty much OK with off-topic posts and
thread drift, too. Not everyone is: Know your audience and all that.

Yabut, he's entitled to e-mail your ISP's abuse team too. You don't want
to give him a reason to do that...

Again, yup, there sure has. And, again, for all I know the M:tG
groups are havens of on-topicality and politeness. This being
Usenet, the chances are slim, of course, but I have an open mind.

Not at all, but the thread originated as cross-posted spam, and
some genius here in A.G.E followed up to this post (A post which I
never saw, by the way, because my ISP has decent spam filters),
quoting the entire thing, and on top of that, he didn't snip the
newsgroups: line.

Well, if you lurk in the M:tG groups, you probably know better than
me if they tolerate off-topic discussions, but keep this in mind:
If someone wanted to complain, would that defense hold up with the
abuse team? Also, the people who participated in the thread were all,
AFAIK, all A.G.E regulars, so why *not* snip RGTMR? Particularly after
a guy from that group asked you to?

But where was the relevance? All participants were A.G.E'rs, and a
guy from RGTMR *politely* asked you to stop it, so why not stop?

Eh, most of it was no-drop quest and planar stuff anyway. Although
the twinks had some nice droppables ;)

Well, no. Ok, I see the smiley, but still: The only stuff that's
really on-topic here, is discussions about the game, the servers, the
players of Everquest. Not that most folks around here care much, of
course, and that's the way I like it, too. Off-topic discussions can
be great fun, and informative to boot, but there are certain topics
that have proven themselves to sooner or later descend into flamefests
of epic proportions, and when you're involved in them, you don't want
to be cross-posting too, or you'd soon be seen as a troll by certain
people.
