I see exactly the same thing (although in my case I do a /who all friends
to fix it). Packet loss jumps to 90% or higher, *without* going
completely LD, and without any ISP-side packet loss. (A laptop sharing the
connection experiences no slowdown or packet loss, zero, nada, none. In
fact my brother can be playing EQ on *his* laptop going through the *same*
connection, and have the problem on my system but not on his.)

Sometimes it doesn't happen to me at all. Some days I'm plagued by it, it
can happen every few seconds.

The key thing is that the "packet loss" is eliminated by an action on the
EQ client; that another EQ client sharing not just the same ISP but the
same *IP address* can be online without the same issue at the same time.

All this adds up to a problem either with the EQ server or client or both.
I've /bugged it a couple of times, and once or twice thought it was fixed,
but keeps happening once or twice a week. It seems to be worse in busy
zones (notably the Bazaar and the Nexus) but also varies from connection
to connection. It first started happening sometime in December, I think,
long before LoY was released.

Whether it's deliberate is another question on which I won't speculate.
