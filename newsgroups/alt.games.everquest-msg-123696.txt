I've had GM rezzes before, more than one during the
first week of Luclin, as a matter of fact.  Greig's End
was particularly buggy on the very first day of play (not
of release...who got to "play" on Luclin on its first
day? ;-)  ).

The crack was directed at the line "unsolicited
GM rez," something which reminded me of the
picture I spoke of

which also happened to be what the general consensus
of what Stormhammer would be like when it went live...
:-)
