 Nowhere in my original post did I say a cleric and warrior killed him.
I said it (probably) could be done based on what I saw and what my guild
members said.

 Yeah, all those people doing epic quests are hurting their guild by
doing unproductive things. It's a quest. I did it on my own time. I also
was getting xp on most of those camps. I can see how members gaining
levels is a real detriment to any guild! Here's a helpful hint: There
are not guild events going on 24 hours a day.

 Spent poorly based on your interpretation.

 Who said you had to kill greens? I was getting xp on just about every
one of those camps. And now with the light blue xp, that probably adds
another 2-3 levels that can get xp there.

 I'm not jealous. At the time I started the quest I knew Brother Z
dropped the robe. If I wanted to I could have done it that way. That's
not exactly how I would define jealousy.
