You know, from the start of this discussion with you, I've tried to be
polite, and gently point out that you were over-reacting to Ray when
he described the event.

You've been a touchy shit head the entire time, though, so despite my
hopes to the contrary it has become dizzyingly clear that you're a
worthless fucking idiot, interested in doing nothing but whine about
your terrible luck with events.

Don't race to fix your computer, please. I enjoy the notion that for a
time, at least, you're not able to play.

Now kindly fuck off, asshole.
