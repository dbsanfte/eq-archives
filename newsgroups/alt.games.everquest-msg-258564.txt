While the Old World is generally assumed to be the continents of Odus, 
Antonica, and Faydwer, its possible that zones added to the game on 
those continents don't count for the purposes of a manastone, I really 
wouldn't know.

Zones which were added: The Hole, Paineel, Stonebrunt (Odus); Jaggedpine 
(Antonica)

Zones which were dramatically revamped: Cazic Thule (Antonica), Grobb 
(Antonica)

Then there are pocket zones like SolC which may or may not even exist 
anymore... I think they were billed as temporary but I haven't heard of 
them going away.

Although the LDoN camps are all in Old World locations, their pocket 
zones/instances might not be considered Old World for your purposes either.

I do have a thought: You are a druid, why do you care about such 
piddling details?  Port to a nice safe old world spot, mana up, then 
gate back to your bind spot near where you hunt, anywhere you like.

Or get a Faithstone, if druids get those (maybe its just clerics and 
shaman, I thought it was all priests)
