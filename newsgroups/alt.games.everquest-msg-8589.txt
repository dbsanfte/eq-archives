Since I will be heading to Vellious in the next couple levels with my warrior,
I'd already started wondering about that. The faction information at eqatlas on
these zones is almost nonexistant, and while Alakhazam offers stats on what to
kill for which faction, it doesn't really tell me which would be best for me.
  So, as a warrior who would obviously be mosting interested in getting high end
armor and weapons usable by my class someday, in addition to good cash, which is
the faction for me to ally with, and which ones would I be fighting against?
What zones and mobs should I be targeting in the early/mid thirties for a good
end result?  Any input from people experienced in these faction wars would be
most appreciated.
