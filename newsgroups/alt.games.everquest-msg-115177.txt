Your frustration is understandable. At the same time I see 2 key
points here:
1. Patches will always be necessary and they will perform them in as
unobtrusive manner as possible.
2. It is *not* some random page somewhere. It's the same page all the
time. Create a link to it on your desktop and check it before starting
EQ.

Doesn't really seem like so much when you boil it down.
