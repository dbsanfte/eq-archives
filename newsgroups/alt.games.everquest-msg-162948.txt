5k really isn't very much for twinking out a whole rogue. Here's what
I suggest you focus on:

1.  Haste - Flowing Black Silk Sash is significantly cheaper than CCHW
and almost as good. You can sometimes get them on Torv for as low as
1k.

2.  A decent main-hand piercer - Get something with close to a 2.0
ratio. Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick can be had very cheaply if it's
available.

3.  A decent off-hand 1hs - For higher levels, it's important to keep
your 1hs up. If you're only piercing-capable, you'll be extremely
limited in weapon upgrades.

4.  HP gear. While leveling up, HPs are your friend in a big way. As
you get higher level, swap it out for more AC-oriented gear.
