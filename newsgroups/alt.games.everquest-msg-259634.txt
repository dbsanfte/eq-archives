Hi All.

Family guild person here.  I only go on open raids and rarely.

I'm currently wearing a wind-worn chestplate
 http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17383
however, I've just saved enough points for a Royal Attendant Breastplate of
Sand
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25336

Is this the best BP a non-raiding cleric could hope to reasonably obtain or
is there a few I've overlooked?

Thanks,

Tuvarilo 65.99 cleric. 115aa's.
Drinal.
