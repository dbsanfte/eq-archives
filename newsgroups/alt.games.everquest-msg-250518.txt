Heh.  The results of almost all polls are suspect. :)

}A) It only polls those users who hit Allakhazam and actually read the body
}of the site to see that there was a poll.  The SOE poll hit every user who
}logged in while the poll was active, and every user had to respond in some
}way to be able to feed their addiction.

True, the Alla's poll ony samples a subset of the population.  Similarly, 
the SOE poll only samples the subset that logs on during the week or two 
the poll is up.  A much larger sample, but still, a sample.  For example, 
I personally didn't vote in the Alla's poll.

}B) You could vote over and over again on the Allakhazam poll.  You could
}click Back on your browser and voice your opinion until your heart was
}content, or you could vote for each option once if you so chose.  The SOE
}poll let you vote one time and one time only.

Well, not strictly true.  I've personally voted in the SOE poll 3-4 times 
so far.  The fact you -can- stuff the box in the Alla's poll does not 
automatically guarantee that someone has done so.  But I practically 
-have- to vote once per account.

}Not that the SOE poll is much better, as I believe the decision was made
}long before they put the poll up.  The perception of having a say on a topic
}is enough to keep the masses quiet in most cases.  But, assuming that I'm
}wrong and they're actually going to pay heed to a poll, the SOE poll is the
}only one that truly matters.

No argument.  But we'll never see the result, so the Alla's poll is the 
-best- (admittedly, from a lousy field of choices) measure -we- have of 
how the poll may have come out.
