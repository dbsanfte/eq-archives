Ok, someone please clarify this for me.

As I understand it:

a single toon can stack one dot from each line
	disease, magic, poison, fire
but a single toon cannot stack two from the same line
	68 fire, 58 fire, 53 fire

two or more toons of the same class can stack the same line on a mob
	toon 1 - fire dot
	toon 2 - fire dot
	toon1 - poison
	toon 2 - poison


I know the latter part is true as Three Feet of Destruction was
tearing ass through Kurn's Tower.  What about the first part?  Could
I, as a 65 necro, stack 5 fire dot's from different levels on a single
mob?  
So I could theoretically stack 15 dot's on a single mob?

That's how I'm reading the quoted post anyway.
