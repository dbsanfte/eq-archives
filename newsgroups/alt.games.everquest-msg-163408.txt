Morning dew is used in a lot of the mid - high end tradestuff tailoring and
smithing maybe a few more skills and like i said above goes for about 50pp
each on my server so for 3 stacks you could get 3kpp I dont know what the
paw is but i am sure you could get some pretty good gear for 3k.

Find out the prices on your server for 1)morning dew and 2)the paw then
decide if you would be wise to agree to his trade.

example use:
to make mithril bonings:

small brick mithril, file, morning dew (stackable)

which can then be used to make:

gorget AC 6, WIS 5, AGI 5, HP 25, mana 25
mask: AC 8, WIS 5, AGI 5, HP 30, mana 30
shoulderpads: AC 8, WIS 5, mana 30, HP 30, DEX 5
gloves AC 9, WIS 5, DEX 5, HP 25, mana 25
wristguard: AC 9, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30, 5 to all saves
cap: AC 9, WIS 5, mana 30, STA 5, HP 30
boots: AC 9, DEX 5, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30
belt: AC 10, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40
sleeves: AC 11, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30
cloak AC 11, STA 5, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40
leggings: AC 15, WIS 10, mana 40, STA 5, HP 40
tunic: AC 21, WIS 10, mana 40, STA 10, HP 40
along with many other things.
