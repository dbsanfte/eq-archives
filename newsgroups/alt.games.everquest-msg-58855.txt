Also, My rogue wass using the mask of deception(sp?) and the faction was
differant when cast. If the enchanter spells work the same, this is how it
will work:

as HE you kill orc you are kos anyway...no big deal
as DE you are NOT kos, infact I walked right inthe throne room of Crushbone
and sat around for a while. Then I killed 2 orcs (oops dumb move) and my
faction with the Indego Bro hood went down, as well as bringing me to
threatenly in CB.

So YES your faction does change to that of stock for that race, but as you
know your religion will totaly derail your illusion - faction wise.
