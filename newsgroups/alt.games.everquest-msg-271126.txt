They're basically encouraging people to pay for two accounts
(regardless of what they say, that is the real reason).
Some Adept I spells are really very common, while others are very rare
(if they exist at all).
In all the 25 levels (in one char plus 20 in another), I have only seen
one 'Master' spell drop in any of my groups, and sadly it was for
another class.
In any case, I find I'm doing quite well with just my apprentice 3
spells, I can solo oranges and have no problem healing my group most of
the time (templar 25 here).
I'm definitely not paying more than 1 gold for an Adept I if I already
have App 3, I only have some 6 gold in my account and don't think the
jump from App3 to Adpt 1 is that big of a deal
