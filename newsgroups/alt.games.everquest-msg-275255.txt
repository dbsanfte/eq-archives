I have a lvl 66 rng, and snare / root mobs all the time soloing.  Mobs turn
to run anywhere from 20% HP down to around 10% or less (depending on the
zone you are in, and sometimes the mob in question).  Rooting a mob that is 
running will always make it focus its attacks on the nearest PC or pet.
Once in a while a few planar mobs won't turn to run until around 6-9% HP.

If no no has snared the mob, or snare wore off, you will see the mob running
off at normal speed.  thats a sure sign to re-cast snare.

If I have a mob rooted, and know its almost to the point where it
should turn and run, then I'll cast a DD spell to break the root.
