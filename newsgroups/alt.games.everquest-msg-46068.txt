Hmm good question. I just got my Elemental Maelstrom, a lvl 44 Mage Dot, and
haven't used it much. I do team up with necro's and druids accoasionally so
would like to know if I can use my dot then.

As a related question. I've gotten my dot from the Shardwurms ysterday. I've
also used it several times since then on those same shardwurms. According to
www.magecompendium.com, the dot does a max of 600 damage. Yet it seems it's
doing a lot more. The initial strike goes for 250 damage, and after that I
really have the feeling that it's seriously munching at the mobs health.
They went down a lot faster then without the dot so I was thinking it might
do more around an extra 800 besides the initial 250 or so (not a total of
600). Can anyone give me some good info on this dot please?
