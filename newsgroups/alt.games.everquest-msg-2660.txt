Hail and well met,

    I have recently engaged in playing an Ogre warrior and am actually
enjoying playing an evil character more than I thought I would.  Recently I
have hit a snag though, he's hit level seven and I have no idea where in the
Feerrot or the surrounding zones a non-twinked Ogre can go to find
opponents.  Does anyone remember where they went around that level?

    Thanks guys,
    MJJ
