I created a barb warrior named Titanus once intended to be a variation of 
the word, "titan". I was in my late teens I believe when it occurred to me 
that it could be read as "tight anus" or even a combination of the words 
"tit" and "anus".

I petitioned and requested the change (with an explanation, of course) and 
the GM basically thanked me for observing the policy and made the change, 
no problem.
