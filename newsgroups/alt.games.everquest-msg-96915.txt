Which would be a violation of the "no names from popular
culture" rule, not an imagined "Name/surname combine
to form a single word" rule, of course, even if true.  Is "Tre
Buchet" against the naming rules, for instance?

Nope, "exterminator" is a valid word, and not against the
rules as far as I can see.  This is just another example of
a GM applying his power without any valid support from
the formal rules.  There's nothing wrong with that, IMO,
but to support it with "well, if you do this, and then take
away that, THEN it's against the rules" is hogwash.  As
is a made-up "Name/surname form a single word" rule.
