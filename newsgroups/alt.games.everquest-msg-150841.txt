Snare is  a generic term, and the name for the level one druid snare.
When people say "druid snares 4 mobs" they almost certainly mean
"druid snares 4 mobs by casting Ensnare (the 29 druid spell)"

This gives you eight minutes 46 seconds before Ensnare runs out on the
first mob.  Don't use Snare for quad kiting, unless the mobs are so
green you will be killing all four before that minute plus a bit is up.

The one thats running towards you fast, instead of slowly. And note that
the druid in your story almost certainly has SOW on.  From 14 on, an
unSOWed druid is a rare sight indeed.  So he doesn't die, he just
runs ahead, targets the closest mob (f8 works for this) since its the one
moving fast, and repeats.

Whats wrong with this approach isn't that it yeilds a dead druid, its that
the druid spends too much time resnaring and then gathering mobs into
a tight cluster again so he can go back to AE nuking.

Yes, but prior to level 34 druids really don't have any worthwhile
AE nukes anyway.  Even at 34, its probably more efficient to
single target kill unless you have a very large mana pool, its embarassing
to see yourself run completely out of mana and your target mobs still
not quite dead yet.

At any rate, 29 or 34 or even 36 is a far far cry from waiting for 57
so they have a AE snare... that they won't use because even if you
can figure out a scenario where its better, they are very very used
to doing it single target by now.
