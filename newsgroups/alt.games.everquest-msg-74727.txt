Say, WHAT??

Just how certain are you of this?  I don't know of any
other object in the game that has that property (other
than actual containers), I don't know why they'd start
doing it now.

What is your source for this info?  I can understand
if it needs to be *fired* from a general inventory slot,
but that's far different from "taking up" a general
inventory slot when being carried.
