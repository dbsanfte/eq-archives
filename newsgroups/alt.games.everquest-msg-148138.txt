Well, for one everybody will have the same system in the case of the
PS2.Same Video Chip , same hard drive and same high speed connection
if you have broadband hook up. Also scrolling with the PS2 controller
isn't that bad and you can get any usp keyboard to work with it.

Naw never happen, Why would they release a third version on EQ for the
PC. you would have Old EQ , EQ2 and EQ adventures? Nope.
More than likely old eq would get dropped in two years,after release
of all the verant new MMORPGs they have coming out within 5 months.
It's gonna suck have resources pulled to different things.
I signed up for the Beta just to try it out and see.
