The only change in graphical lag that it makes is that the number of lines
rendered is the same at all resolution settings, only the interface itself
looks smaller because it's rendering them tighter.

Of course if you play in minimum resolution in full-screen...  well,
assuming that it's rendering the half-screen interface on the fly it's the
same anyways.

I play in full screen mode (1024x768 I believe) just because it looks better
and I can move windows around, but I *definitely* see an increase in FPS
when I jump over to half screen to adjust a setting (usually clip plane)

Going by the filesize on those bmps, I'd say she's playing in minimum
resolution (since at higher resolutions, even in the half-screen view it
takes a shot of the black area outside the interface that's being rendered,
or so it has for me)
