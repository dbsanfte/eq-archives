There is a definite cycle in SK for Quillmane, actually it's 3 of 'em
I think. Do a search on the Ranger's Glade for Quillmane and if they
didn't loose the old threads when they moved a few months ago you'll
find a pretty good thread on the subject. I looked it up about a year
ago when a friend of mine was working on her Epic. 

I don't recall if they had all the PHs figured out at the time, the
one that I can definitely say is an undead cyclops. Quillmane popped
for us within seconds of killing him. The spawn point for that PH was
somewhere close to the shadowman camp with pathing towards the spires
from there. I never did figure out whether it was 3 independent cycles
or just one cycle with 3 possible starting positions, or even whether
those starting positions where random within a given area or not. Just
as we where starting to figure things out he popped and dropped the
cloak. Took all of about 30 minutes. 

You might also want to check the mage boards, they're the ones that
have an interest in that spawn. If I wanted to try and check the
cycle, I'd start when an undead cyclops is up. Follow him around to
figure out the path. Kill him and see what pops, repeat ad nauseum
until you figure it out.
