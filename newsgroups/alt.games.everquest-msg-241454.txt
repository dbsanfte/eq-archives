When I was having guild troubles, I went through a period where I would 
go anon and hide out tradeskilling and refuse to be a rez ho. Never 
really was into soloing, and was pretty shell shocked over the treatment 
I was getting in guild so I didnt want to find an xp group that was full 
of total strangers. Serious trust issues.

Besides, you have to do something with your drops=) and it isn't too 
bad, I can tradeskill and chat with people for hours without having to 
worry about keeping someone alive=)

Although I have been known to be a Dom now and then when asked properly=)
