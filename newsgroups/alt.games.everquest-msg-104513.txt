Sporali Moldmaster in Runnyeye.  I've heard 11% to 16% haste on it.  That
debate will rage on and on.

It's on level 3 and can spawn in a few different places.  When you attack
it, you will get the attention of all the other sporali and when you kill
it, it turns into a lot of little sporlings which attack you too.  Good luck
to you.
