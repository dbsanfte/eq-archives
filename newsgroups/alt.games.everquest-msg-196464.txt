Can't you split the blocks to make bricks?

I remember making a fortune doing something similar in CC on velium, people were
desperate for the small pieces and yet leaving the blocks to rot, I collected
these and handed them to a smith friend who cut them up and sold them at an
enormous profit, splitting it with me.

I'm sure I could have done the work myself, but it was more fun to collude with
my friend and help her make actual money off smithing (something that generally
doesnt happen till the post 200 levels, it seems)
