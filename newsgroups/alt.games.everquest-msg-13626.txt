	I'm not 60, but I've been playing this game almost since release
(Tuttle turned two last month!), and I spend a lot of time working on tactics
and figuring out the game engine, as well as looking at other people's
research and seeing how that jives with my own data. It's the stuff that
most powerful guilds do. So, yeah, I think I understand this game pretty well.

	And in my time playing, I can't say for sure what is an exploit or
not. Some things are very clear, like attacking a MOB when it has zero chance
of hitting you back (wall exploits in Freeport, the firepot exploit in Guk,
etc). This case is not so cut-and-dry. It's not even close.

>They used a bug to get a mob to not attack while you killed it? Where is the
>gray area here?

	Because the MOB /was/ attacking back. If the MOB /wasn't/ then
why would they resort to COH to clear aggro? The MOB couldn't hit them, so
who cares about aggro? They used COH to manage aggro in an effective manner
to keep their clerics from being killed.

	The main problem with what they were doing, and why they had to
use COH, was that res effects have a 5% slow attached to them, and their
warriors could not build up sufficient hate to tank consistently. So their
clerics would get summoned and killed while the warriors couldn't tank
due to the slow and the aggro that the clerics had.

	So they used COH periodically to clear clerics aggro so the warriors
could tank.

	That sounds a hell of a lot like tactics to me. The res thing is
very borderline exploit, IMHO. I don't see much difference between that and
using Clarity to over-write Yelinak's mana-DOT.

>Wether or not it is broken, conquest still cheated. Trying to justify your

>arguement to justify what you alreayd know is wrong.

	My point in that post was two-fold: I don't think Conquest had a
clear case of cheating, certainly nothing that warrented Veran't actions, and
Verant is wrong when they say the zone is finished.

>One gives the Mob's a chance, the other doesn't.

	Conquest got him to 60% and was doing very poorly even with their
supposed exploits. The MOB was still kicking their asses. I'd say Ventani
had a chance.
