/Pause

  Used to delay hotkey processing until a command has completed
execution.

	usage: /Pause nn,command

'nn' is a an integer value representing the number of 1/10ths of a 
second to deley. 'command' can be any command normally into a
hotbutton, such as /Attack, /Doability, or /Shiver.

Many commands such as /Attack should be instant and not need a /Pause,
but others, such as /Cast or /Taunt have a recycle time before they 
are complete.  

If you're not sure how long of a delay is needed, try using the follow
Hotbutton to test with, adding 10 to the Pause value until the Say
command properly follows your command.  Next repeat the process, 
subtracting 1 from the Pause value until the sequence fails.  Add
1 or 2 back to the pause, and you should be set.

	/Hotbutton Pushme
	line 1: /Pause 10,(your command here)
	line 2: /say I'm hopefully done processing
