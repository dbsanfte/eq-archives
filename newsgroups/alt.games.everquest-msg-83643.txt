I would not like to be a company in the US seen to be directly marketing at
the "family sector" for a  MMRPG - it sounds like litigation hell.

*Trailer trash*     "Ever since we started playing EQ little Jessica has
been blowing guys in the school cubicle for HQ bear pelts and little Johnny
has taken up crack smoking to pass the time medding. My husband ran of with
some 20 stone cyber trash talking fat bitch from Montana who plays a Wood
Elf on Tribunal. I think we had a tiny fella here at some stage but he kept
cry during raids so I had to lock him in the pantry....hey - that might
explain that bad smell around here lately. Anyway - it's all Sony's fault so
I called my lawyer..."

*Audience*    "Go sister!!"
