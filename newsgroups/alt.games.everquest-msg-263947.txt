Yes, it's like my Alchemy. Since I had to traverse the entirety of both the 
Artisan and Scholar trees to get there, I will always be an Artisan and 
Scholar in addition to being an Alchemist, so I can make any of the scrolls 
from 1-19 that are the province of Scholars. Similarly, as a Weaponsmith, 
the full Artisan and Outfitter trees, with all of their associated armor, 
will remain available to you. There are some pretty nice armor suits 
available in the Outfitter line, but remember, like Scholar, they will 
probably only con appealing to members of the 1-19 levels.

I wouldn't mind such a compromise, I'll in favor of giving others what they 
want from the system as long as they don't take away the part of the system 
that appeals to me. Given SOE's track record in the past, it wouldn't 
surprise me to see this kind of thing happen. I welcome it.

Yeah, I loved the aspect of finding and then acquiring rare coppers and 
steels with extraordinary stats, it was an incredible sub game within a 
game. But yet, there were a couple of boners they pulled like the one you 
describe that watered down the enthusiasm.

Well, there is no New Qeynos Crafting Mastery AA and as far as I know, no 
way of ever changing or supplementing your existing character's tradeskills 
with another. So once you commit to the path of one crafting archetype, 
you're forgoing all others. This has mixed results, but overall I think it's 
a reasonable decision.
