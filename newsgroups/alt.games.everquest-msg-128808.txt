Muzzle is rather pointless when you have BO4 though. Pet's are capped at 60%
haste (BO3 is already 60%, but BO4 also gives some ac and str next to the
65% haste afaik).
If you want to see the tests do some searches on magiciantower's ezboard.
There are several threads with the tests of BO3, BO4, muzzles and even
shammie's avatar buff.

Oh and there is no chance I'm going to outdamage a hasted 60 ranger or
epicced 60 monk on any fight that lasts longer then my mana pool without my
epic :(
