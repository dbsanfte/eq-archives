Wow, you must be REALLY nit-picky.

I have a AMD 1.8Ghz, 512MB RAM, GeForce4 Ti4400 with 128MB and I run with 
ALL the bells and whistles on and get well over 30fps everywhere except the 
Bazaar. In the Bazaar I just turn down the clipping plain to make it 
bearable. And that is running on a dialup connection.
