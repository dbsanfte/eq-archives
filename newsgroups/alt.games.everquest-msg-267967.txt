Yes -- it's a monetary system unique in representation to EQ.
Plat in EQ isn't the same as Plat in EQ2, BTW.  The idea
of using money isn't IP;  the implementation of that idea
inside EQ would be.

Well, it has a pattern doesn't it?  But that's not important:
the EQ world's monetary system is clearly IP, created
for the game.

Then IGE would be in violation of copyright laws unless they
received permission.  *shrug*

People who buy plat or items or chars online aren't spending
the time (and giving Sony the associated revenue) which would
be associated with getting them themselves.  I'd say that's a
pretty definite argument for damages.
