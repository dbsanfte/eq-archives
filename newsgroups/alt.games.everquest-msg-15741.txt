300 for the tunic??  120 for a foreman's tunic??  One way higher than I
expected, one a bit low.

Man, here I am casually trying to sell the tunic for 70p and no one bites
(made it for my monk, decided that foreman's or some other chest piece is
better).  Guess I'd better crank it up to about 150 and settle for 125.
