OK idiots, read my whole post and be humbled:

See the example with EC? buy a 50 point item there, and be able to buy items
worth up to 50 points there with points from other camps.

Then see the next paragraph?  Know what the word completely means? I hope
so!  To COMPLETELY unlock a camp, and be able to buy anything there, you buy
a 1492 point item.  See previous paragraph that says you can buy a cheap
item and unlock UP TO THAT PRICE.

Good lord.
