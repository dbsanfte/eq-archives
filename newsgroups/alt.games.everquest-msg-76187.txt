I like my Radeon because its easier to use the TV, and it has a flatscreen
port in case I get one
I like the GeForce because its more customizable than the Radeon
I dont watch DVD's too often, sometimes I just get a PS2 down in my room

About the RAM on the cards though... 32DDR or 64SD, thats one of the biggest
things stopping me from keeping the GeForce.

The GeForce performed teh same as the Radeon until I turned the textures
down to medium (and its ugly that way!) but now I can see EQ like it used to
be pre-SoL. I can turn in a circle with full clip again, thats a plus....
but I never tried the Radeon on Medium textures before
