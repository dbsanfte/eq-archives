Yes, rogues are great fun.  The problem is, you REALLY have to work hard 
to convince anybody else of this fact. ;p  Unless you have a large/close 
guild, expect to spend a lot of time LFG in your 20s and 30s.  Right now 
I usually end up doing a loop of OT/DSP/HHK to find a group.  Lots of 
running. ;p

Although for those who know about last night's group experience, here's 
a not-so-random quote ;p:

[Sun Jan 26 01:04:11 2003] Stormrunner tells the guild, 'So when you 
getting here Eiri, Eilistrae wants to pull reds...'
