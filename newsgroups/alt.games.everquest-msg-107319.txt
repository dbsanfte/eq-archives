The fungi is useful for soloing like the iksar regen is, when you want
to heal up HP while you med for a sec or something. My troll sk has an
iksar regen bp which is 19 ac and I only put it on after fights to
heal HP. By the time I have some mana again, I'm at full hp at level
36.

At 60 I would not buy the Fungi at all but instead get a very good
regular use BP. I mean a barbed ringmail is better for a tank and is
like 5 k plat (30 ac, 10 str, 50 hp) With regrow and a druid you have 
no use for a fungi really. Most people at 60 would be buying a fungi
for two reasons, one being that they want to solo some and two being
that they have a low level twink they want to heal hp faster than mobs
can damage it.

Sounds pretty much like you have no real use for a fungi so if I were
you I'd not spend the outrageous plat they cost, or if I got one at
the camp I'd sell it.
