Pushing through 40 levels with the hybrid XP penalty, for the sake of that
spell book, will do that.  I'm just thankful that I didn't have to suffer
through the "Paladin brings his XP penalty to the entire group" deal.  Every
time the balance of the knight classes is brought up, the spell book is
mentioned as if it justifies either beefing up warriors to the exclusiong of
the knights (so that knights wouldn't be able to tank anything not green to
them), or nerfing the knight classes.  Nobody considers the issue of
multi-nerfing.  Our spells are always at least one circle behind clerics,
and update half as often, and our mana pool is far less than them.  Before
PoP, we also were pretty far behind warriors for tanking ability (which was
only right, on the tanking side, that is).

I can't say my heals were absolutely useless, but I can say that, if I had
to heal, things were going the wrong way (though I did try to keep people
topped off).

I'm well aware of the brittle nature of an enchanter.  My roommate plays one
similar to your's, except without the HoT gear.

Indeed.  A good player can find a way to make any class shine.  You'll
notice that the bulk of your praise for a Paladin is for his ability to hold
aggro with his spells.  That's exactly part of the problem with giving
Warriors the same aggro-holding skills.  If a Warrior can keep hate as well
as a Pally, and dual wield for more DPS, and has a bit more HP and AC (which
really should be more than "a bit," but that's a seperate issue), then
Pallys are no longer wanted.  That's not to say warriors shouldn't have a
bit more aggro-gaining skills, but Paladins and SKs should hold the
advantage; if they're just as good as knights at holding aggro, then our
spell book is "overwritten" by yet another class.

So, again, if a warrior could hold hate as well, no need for Pally.

I thought so, but Saylyn wasn't home to check with (and I was too lazy to
hit Caster's Relm).

I could see this becoming a legitimate reason to have a Paladin.  Though, I
would think FD pulling would be preferred.

But all these things are based around the Paladin's ability to hold aggro.
If you make Warriors equal in that respect, then the paladin's area of
excellence fades.
