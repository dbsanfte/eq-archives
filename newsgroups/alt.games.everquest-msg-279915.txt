There has GOT to be some legitimate explanation for the discrepency. 
Because for me its nearly always completely random too.

I keep junk in my top two slots (clicky atk & damage shield) and mobs 
skip them as often as not. Just randomly punching holes in my buff 
window. If I get hit with a big dispell on a full buff window I'll have 
holes.

Sooo....

There are several possibilities:

1) The mobs you fight use dispels that knock them off the top while the 
ones I fight dispel randomly.

2) There is some formula that's applied to determine which buff slots 
get stripped, and in your case it invariably chooses the top two. 

a) Perhaps the dispell walks your buff list, and the junk buffs you 
happen to use in the first 2 slots are particularly vulnerable to 
dispells so it never goes deeper...there's a lot of possible 
formulations that could yield something like this.

b) Perhaps there is a static aspect of your character tied to seeding 
the random number generator... and for you it just always comes up 1 
then 2.

c) Perhaps there is an issue related to a "resist check" that's based on  
relative level... perhaps when fighting very high con red raid mobs they 
always make the check, so its always your first two. While I fight a lot 
more blues - yellows so my buffs often resist the debuff allowing deeper 
buffs to try (and fail) to resist being dispelled.

d) Perhaps there is a "resist check" related to, say, Magic resist and 
perhaps you have very high MR so all your buffs make the resist check as 
it walks your buff list. And then if it reaches the end of the buff list 
and still owes you a dispell it just takes the first ones.



I don't know... but I can state unequivically that I cannot rely on 
buffs being dropped out of MY top slots at all. They get left behind as 
often as not.
