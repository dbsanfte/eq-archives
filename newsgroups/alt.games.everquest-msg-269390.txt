I took that number from one of my logs from a character that never
ever grouped. I do remember it crossing into the 100 range at that
level when I was quadding (so fighting a low dark blue rather than a
high dark blue, just like your wizard). But the 60 number is more
valid - it was the upper limit of what that character could reliably
solo, just like the yellows in EQ2.

Its still there in EQ2, just lessoned. Compared to a like level EQ1
character, I don't think I could do much better than two yellows vs
one blue, and now we're talking about TEN TIMES more kills (it was,
iirc, about 30-40 kills per level in the 20s in EQ1).

Soloing in EQ2 just doesn't feel worth doing to me. That means I will
log out rather than solo, which is a mmorpg death sentence (again, for
me).

If I could still take group mobs at that level (green ^^ for example)
it would be a different story, since those gave enough exp to be worth
doing. It would still be over 100 kills I think, but you'd see the
progress. But I can't do it reliably, not without running out of
power. Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but that is not my
impression at all from what other people are saying.
