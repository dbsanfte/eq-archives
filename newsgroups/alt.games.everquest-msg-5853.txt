Is there such a place that has listings of all the guilds people have 
made? Such as a list of all the guild names with a brief outline of their 
goals/aims/requirements? I have been approached in the past with the 
guild join box from people but never actually been told what they 
represent (apart from one, da troll patrol on Veeshan whom I really liked 
but never found anyone ever again to readmit my new troll sk ). Any other 
useful info on guilds would be very helpful. I don't play much so I don't 
want to form my own guild, and I have a variety of chars on a couple of 
servers - Veeshan (mainly) also Xev.

Thanks for all the help.
