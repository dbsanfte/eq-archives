Seeing as I did play AC for a significant length of time, I guess I can 
keep talking.

/boggle/

And that isn't the common wisdom in EQ??  Hell... things don't usually 
get all sorted out for a full months after a significant expansion.

And lets not count the unscheduled 'emergency patches' that are 
invariably present after any major eq patch day... I play late EST... 
I've been kicked off at 3am every single day for a week straight 
numerous times as they patch the previous nights patch...

And lets not forget the Bazaar which didn't actually work until 
PoP...the casinos which are currently broken, that epic with the faction 
issues, or the myriad of other quests that are totally broken...the 
recent skills window bug, the recent teleporting mobs bug, the recent 
targeting circle bugs.

XP chains were part of the game, for better or for worse. Macroing was a 
  more widespread problem, but I don't recall them ever having an 
organized unit of cash generators screwing up the entire server 
economies, nor such obvious item duping bugs (shared bank slot!) 
either... and really, what do I honestly care if someone else is 
macroing a skill up if it doesn't directly effect me.

The only place macroers were a problem was darktide... but then... eq's 
pvp hasn't really been a shining success either... or did you miss the 
teleport exploits on discord...

Plus, For what its worth, I thought the portal bots were actually a 
pretty novel invention. I'd bet the c3 whores would kill for way of 
peddling their crack without having to sit at the stupid keyboard 
wasting their night away. And it would be cool to see a player run 
translocating druid setup in Katta Castellum or other out of the way 
places... but not cool enough to actually play one.

I recall it cost the same as Ykesha too... ACs expansion was far better 
value.

You also forgot property ownership came out with that expansion, 
something EQ still doesn't have...

As as for griping about just getting a new continent... if you pull out 
your very first EQ box, the one from '99 ... it reads "Explore 5 huge 
continents"... we didn't have 5 huge continents until velious came 
out... so to explore the 5 huge continents advertised on the box you had 
wait a year, and purchase 2 of them separately... and calling Odus 
(especially pre-Paineel/Hole/Warrens/Stonebrunt/Gunthak Odus huge was a 
joke. It had one tiny outdoor zone (Toxx) and one tiny 'dungeon' (Kerra 
Island), and one virtually deserted city (even in its old world prime)...

THAT is something to gripe about!

And I'd take Turbines attitude toward their customers over SOEs 
everyday, three times over. Turbine has long since conceded that EQs 
marketing of boxes (two keep fresh boxes on store shelves) was a better 
marketing model... but ACs approach was a lot more consumer oriented.

AC gave you a dynamic world for your subscription fee. SOE gives you a 
static world. If anything changes, rest assured upwards of 400,000 
people gave them another 30 bucks over and above their subscrition to 
pay for it...
