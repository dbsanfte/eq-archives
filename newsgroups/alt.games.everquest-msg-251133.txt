Under the help link I found I should click on "my profile" to
edit my preferences,but I cant see a my-profile-button!?
Then there is a link "Edit my preferences" under board options,
but the options are greyed and dont work.
I am sure that I am logged in,when I enter wrong password on
purpose I get an error message.
