Few things here:

By most people's reckoning, "mid level" doesn't begin until you hit
50. And, truly, by the xp scale and time spent leveling, they're
right. In general, it usually takes more time to get from 51-65 than
it takes to get from 1-50.

Next, I've been able to get groups for LDoN just as easily at level 20
as I can at level 55.

Finally, a 4 person group isn't by any means "large". In fact, 4 is
about average in my experience (considering groups I've seen
pre-LDoN).
