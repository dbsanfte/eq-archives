is it just me, or would everyone benefit from more spell slots.  even doing
one extra spell slot past 51st on up would help.  The "client" engine is
sorely outdated, with even the "help" button outdated.  they could use the
entire left side of the initial screen to show 8 more buttons for spell
casting.   even going to full screen transperancy mode you get 10 slots
instead of 6 for user defined macros.

almost all classes have a ton of spells to cast, and 8 slots to squeeze it
all thru.  This is probably the single biggest bottleneck in the game for
casters/hybrids.

I would like this to be pushed to verant big time, we need more spell slots
for everyone be added to the client.

I think I brought this up a year or longer ago, and will probably continue,
because while they add new content and what not, the client engine is what
needs to be revamped.
