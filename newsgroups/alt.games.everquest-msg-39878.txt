You are failing to miss our point . We dont want to play in the sandbox . We
want the video game disk that is hidden in the sandbox . We want the playboy
bunny who is just waiting in the sandbox .

If gear is being camped for in low level dungeons then that gear is the
mistake . For instance take the ancient crocidile . It drops an item that
2/3rds of the population on a server from level 1-50 want as an improvement
to their gear. This isnt a sandbox item for them even though it drops off of
a level 25 mob . Any sandbox item that a higher level actually wants to get
for himself to wear is higher level content put in the wrong place . There
are alternate ways to fix this this . If you just make sure that higher
level alternatives are available you fix part of the problem and all of it
after those items are distributed . All of the newer items that give
enduring breath have taken enormous pressure off of the fishbone earring ,
but at one time that earring was it .

Once you realize that we are fighting over the mistakes you should see a
couple of other things . The first is that the TCC makes the mistakes worse
not better . Second the TCC is not needed if there are no mistakes because
then you have few high levels playing in the sandbox anyway.
