"We have confirmed with Scott Hartsman that this was an intentional
 feature introduced and that it will be staying in game."

"The reason that it wasn't announced [...] We needed a few days of
 measuring [...] If that blew up before anyone was chatting globally,
 we'd have known that we had more work to do. :)"

In addition to joining channels hosted on other servers (eg /join
firiona.hardcoreroleplayers), there are also non-server-specific
channels (/join serverwide.killalldruids), although functionally I'm not
entirely sure of any difference.

I haven't played in a few days, anybody know if they've fixed the
new-UI message spoofing bug in the last patch?

Cheers,
Jock
