Yeah, but I also tested it some time in the past (not sure how long ago)
and got results just like Scott is claiming (I posted elsewhere in this
thread).  So either, (1) it used to work that way and has been changed
since, or (2) the couple times I was paying close attention the "random"
results happened to match the oldest-first hypothesis.  It's worth
pointing out that DT also was operating under the belief that Cancel
Magic hit the oldest effect first.
