the other night on the zebuxoruk server i was at the oasis and twice groups
of specters 2 to 4 of them were running roughshot up and down the coast near
the dox.needless to say there were a few corpses laying about.a few players
were shouting that who ever is pulling the specs should stop.if they cant
finish them all off on there own then leave them be.another faction shouted
that the specs do that every once in a while. they come off the island and
tear s#!t up.this went back and forth getting quite heated.so i bring it up
here, to see what your is take on this situation.
