OK binds. A caster who can bind can do so just about anywhere. That spot
they cast the spell bind affinity at is where they will return on death.
Casting in in Naggys Lair is therefore.....foolish.

As far as casting on another player is concerned effectively you have you
first bind when the character is created..its where you appear the first
time you die (the newbie spot). Other than that if you are a non-bind
caster then only certain zones and locations work. Usually these are city
zones, Freeport, Kelethin etc. The caster groups with you, casts bind
affinity on you and then you will reappear in that spot the next time you
die. Other than anywhere in a city zone there are a few bind spots around
the world (the gypsy camp in North Karana for instance) where binds work
for non-casters as well.

Ports....essentially casters by a spell for each location that a port goes
to. They can cast the port type spell and the target person or group will
reappear at the destination chosen (spell goes off and you zone to the new
spot basically).

Int based casters have as their destinations assorted wizard spires around
the world and appear in those at the end of the zoning process. Druids use
the various druid henges scattered about the world as their end points.
They can start anywhere, though a taxi service caster will go from
destination to destinnation in sequence.


So to use your situation, in Felwithe, want to go to say Qeynos. You stamp
about finding someone willing to port you..a druid offers Surefall and a
Wizzy offers North Karana. Surefall is closer so if the price is right you
choose that. You meet the druid who groups and casts. You zone in at
Surefall. THe druid could then be prevailed upon to bind you in Surefall
as its a city zone effectively, or you could say thanks and head south to
Qeynos and get bound at the gate of the city.

Alternately if the wizzy says 'Im going to NK anyway I'll take you for
free' you might take him up on that. You do much the same....meet them and
group then zone to the Wiz Spires in NK. Then you have a choice...either
run to Qeynos, assume you will get there without incident and just get
someone to cast bind when you arrive, or hope the nice wizzy will bind you
close by at the gypsy camp, or that someone else will do this for you
before you run off across the plains. If you happen to die at any stage
you will reappear at the last place you got someone to cast bind affinity
on you.

This can cause some mild problems......for instance if hunting in
Everfrost do not forget that the plast place someone cas bind affinity on
you was Firiona Vie (says he from personal experience)....as it will cramp
your style. When you travel, know where you are going and get a bind at
your new city base of ops before you go a-hunting...or cast it yourself if
you can.
