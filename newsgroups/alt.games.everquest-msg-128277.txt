*chuckle*  aye.. well, when my shaman is soloing (and my necro as well)..  I
usually run the same routine.. slow, root, dot dot, (by that time it's hit
me and my pet is beating on it), jbb jbb jbb jbb jbb..dead.  but thats too
much for one hotkey.. maybe if they allowed comma's between commands, so you
could put multiple commands on the same line.  (yeah, if my programming
teachers ever found out how much I could really put on one line)...
