Bah, it ain't all about what you said.  I enjoy seeing Darwinism at work.
*shrug*  My main point, though, was that the scenario proposed is pretty 
unlikely in Oakland.  Especially since in one of the earlier posts in 
the thread you said something about in a "good" Oakland neighborhood... 
And there just aren't any bars fitting that description in Rockridge, 
Piedmont, Montclair, etc... :)  Maybe that Compton place down in LA or 
something.  Or certain parts of Chicago, although Chicago seemed a lot 
mellower overall last time I was there.
