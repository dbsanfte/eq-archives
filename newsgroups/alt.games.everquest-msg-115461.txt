Heh, the one nuke that I did try was an abysmal failure.

Yup, like I had said, they wanted me for the resist buffs, not porting, that
was just an added bonus.

Yup, I offered to do the pickups at the beginning so that we could get
underway faster since I knew we didn't have any other porters, I was not
excited to learn that they expected me to take them home as well (which I
didn't learn until AFTER Vox died).  I suppose we didn't have more porters
due to the fact that the raid leader didn't want more than 24 people, but a
wizard would've been nice instead of the warrior half of the inseparable 52
cleric/46 warrior combo that we only needed the cleric out of.

This includes being bored off my ass in Oasis for about 40 minutes waiting
for an LD that never showed back up.
