Clear to the TiV room
You should be left with TiV in the centre, and a row of mobs on the left and
right wall.

Go right, kill each of the mobs along the wall, you will be near TiV now.

Have 1 enchanter cast tash on him and stand still, everybody else now moves
behind TiV, on the back wall. EVERYBODY.
Whilst he is agro on the enchanter, he won't attack anybody else.

Have your tank stand behind TiV (with his back to the wall), and get
everybody else to form a barricade behind the MA.
This human shield will stop your tank being knockbacked out of range.

Then engage as normal. The key with TiV is not to turn him.. sacrifice
rogues BS damage if they can't quite graspe this... everybody should have
their backs facing the wall to attack him.  Get this down and he's a real
wuss.  Turn him, and you get 10 adds or so.

Keeping him facing the wall is about the only difficult aspect of TiV.
