That sounds more like the drivers/chipset for your graphic card.  What
info I've dug up on the laptop seems to indicate that the graphics
card is probably an Intel� Graphics Media Accelerator 900.  Cards like
this use the motherboard's RAM and CPU to handle the graphic workload.
Extremetech.com ( http://qurl.com/kg98h ) did a review of this card
and found "the GMA 900 includes no geometry processing capabilities �
neither a fixed-function T&L processor nor hardware vertex shader
unit. Rather, it relies on the CPU to process all geometry functions."
That, and that fact that the laptop CPU is not that speedy, might well
be where your problem lies.

I note that the HP/Compaq page at http://qurl.com/s6yl6 says the 4000
has been discontinued ("Discontinued products - Compaq Presario R4000
Notebook PC series").  If that's YOUR model and you've just bought it
for (to quote you) "big bucks" I think you've possibly been sold 'old'
technology. 

It doesn't sound like an overly hopeful situation, regards playing EQ
on your laptop, so I hope I am wrong  :)
