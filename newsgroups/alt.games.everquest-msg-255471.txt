EB has them but not till August...

We had ours ordered from Gamespot, but when they broke their agreement with
Sony I cancelled my orders.  9 Accounts between myself, wife, and my
children.

I look at it this way, if they break an agreement with Sony, what are the
chances of these bozos honoring their agreement with me if I hae a problem
with my CDs?  They just can't be trusted now.
