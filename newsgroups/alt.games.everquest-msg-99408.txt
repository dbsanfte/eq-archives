I jumped the bandwagon when Luclin got released, and did unfortunately not
get the Velious addon at once.. (Original with Kunark) But i have bought it
now..

Problem is : I already have Luclin installed..

What will happen if i install Velious.. Will the Velious textures be the
"old" ones, and the patcher "understand" that i have Luclin textures on, and
then download the right textures?
Or will i have to reinstall Luclin with the "update textures" to really get
the updates for Velious?

Or worst case, will Velious totally fuck up everything? :))

Anyone done a addon install AFTER Luclin, that is of the "old" kind?
