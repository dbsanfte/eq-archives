The outcome of this;

Log in 3 accounts asap.
Petition with main one (empty GM list)
Not to optimistic of a response within the time I have, I set about sorting
out the items I need for corpse summons.
Log Main, Warrior on (in EC) head into Neriak to buy coffin(s) only have one
container slot so buy just the one and a meet druid (who ported back from
GD) in EC, head to Sro to find the lesser reagent. Much searching, asking
and LD'ing find the Gypsy in Oasis that sells them (Heard anything from,
only available in SH to available in any city...I didn't find any in Neriak
but probably looked in the wrong place) head back to Neriak with Druid in
tow. Still short one real coffin.
Druid goes LD in Neriak Commons (invis'd) I head on to 3rd gate buy required
coffin and 2 tiny ones (just in case) head back to meet Druid, now relogging
in.
Get tell from Guide....LOL!

Guide performs Summons and 100% res on all three corpses...I'll keep the
coffins for another day :ï¿½)

Log off, go out.
