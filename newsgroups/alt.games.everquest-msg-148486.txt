Let's compare what it takes to do a tradeskill:

        EQ                  DAoC
    Gather the          Gather the
    components          compenents

    Put them in
    tradeskill
    container,
    no stacking

    Press "combine"     Click hotkey for the
                        thing you are trying to
                        make, which automatically
                        takes the necessary components
                        from inventory, combines them,
                        and puts the result in inventory.

    Drop the made item
    into your inventory

How can you find the DAoC system more mindnumbing?
