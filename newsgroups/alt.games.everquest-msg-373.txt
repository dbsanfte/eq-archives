Hope some of you Erudite wizzy types out there have already done this
one. Once you get the weird backpack filled up with ice goblin beads,
and return, Josper had said "make sure you hit combine before returning
it". This leads to a few questions:
1. Do you need to hit combine right in front of him, or can you do it up
in Everfrost to make sure it works?  Can it "not work", forcing you to
get six more sets of beads?
2. What's with the combine thing on a backpack anyway?
3. Do you hand Josper whatever comes from combining the beads, or does
he get the whole pack back? Can I keep the backpack?
One tiny wizard. Such big questions.
