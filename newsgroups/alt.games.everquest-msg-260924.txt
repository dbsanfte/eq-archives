It's supposed to be very good for soloers post 65 according to what the
gossip was in PoK. I've now played the task system with characters ranging
from 16 to 41 and each of them was asked to kill 10 red mobs. Some necros
might be able to do that, but my cleric, ranger, paladin, warrior and mage
were not. Past 65, apparently you are assigned deeb or even light blue mobs,
and one necro (66) i met there swore he was killing them so fast he only
stopped because his fingers were sore. In chardok, he said. Anyone here know
if that's just boasting or could someone really do what he claimed?

In the bazaar they were saying that the loot for groups was better than GoD
and the mobs were easier, but I haven't met anyone who can confirm the level
66 necros' story. For non-soloing classes, i find soloing even a deep blue
hard, eg a cleric vs undead is doable but i've fought mobs that don't root,
and one of the tasks had me fighting an underwater ape that kept
interrupting my gate spell (i hate underwater combat and most classes can't
fight well underwater, maybe pet classes), and despite having all spell
skills maxed and fairly decent bazaar bought gear, it was close.

The ape was part one of the task and the second part was killing deep red
drachnid spinners in firona vie... that zone that used to be piled with
corpses from people fleeing them to get to LOIO. Pass. Back to trying for a
group. Oh well, maybe i'll get to 65 one day or maybe they'll realise how
dumb making mid levels solo red mobs is.
