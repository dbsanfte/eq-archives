It's to my belief that East Commonlands is much more easy than
Butcherblock.  It's also my belief that people like going to the
Butcherblock LDON camp for adventures more because of the life tap proc
augments.  I mean, you can find lots of weapons that proc damage
spells, but you can hardly find a weapon that you can use for your
class that has a damaging proc that heals you back!  Personally, I like
the higher damage procs, because the life tap procs aren't going to do
anything for me.

South Ro camp will always seem like a hard buy because people have
weakened and wimped out over the years since everyone moved out of
Sebilis for hunting.  They're all afraid of harm touch mobs and
dispelling buffs.  Truth be told, Guk isn't all that bad.

In the end, if people go to a camp just because it's easy to do, and
yet they don't have the proper points in the other camps to properly
use them on the good stuff, they're not very bright for wanting to go
to just that camp.
