I bought it for that Plane only. I have a 19 druid and a 17 bard.... I took
my 17 bard to Erudin, Shar Vahl, Rivervale (to get to High Keep) and back to
Freeport within about 10 to 15 minutes max.....

The porting absolutely rules and the Plane of Knowledge does not have any
monsters, or at least not where the ports are. You can make a lvl 1
barbarian warrior and level him up in Greater Faydark if you wish.....

The ports to the cities are all in the newbie zones in front of the city
close to the city entrance. It was SO worth it for me to drop down the 29.95
and buy PoP. One day i'll reach a level high enough to move to the other
planes, but this works great for me at the moment.

The druids are going to lose some drastic income.
