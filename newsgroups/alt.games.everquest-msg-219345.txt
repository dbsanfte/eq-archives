I see a lot of jokes and jibes thrown at Rangers, but they are never
that negatively motivated. Most of the best Ranger jokes come from
their own class message board. I can't think of any class in EQ (not
even "droods") that are being dragged down or subjected to cruel
humor. 

Everyone jokes about classes (some more than others), but I fail to
see an outright negative campaign against any class.
