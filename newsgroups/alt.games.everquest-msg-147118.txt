The problem with this is that runes for a level X spell typically drop off
mobs whose level is in [X,X+4].  So, to get your X spells at X, you need to
find groups fighting even and higher mobs, but that is generally not as
efficient as fighting blues, so most groups want to fight blues.

So, don't feel bad about taking shortcuts.  E.g., I didn't reasearch
Levitation--I went and bought it from a Shaman spell vendor.  The research
spells that are important can almost all be obtained from other classes
vendors, or the runes can be obtained elsewhere.  For example, you can get
the runes for Ice Comet from the Staff of the Wheel quest.  (Arguably, Ice
Comet is not all that important any more...once you get Draught of Fire at
51, Ice Comet just isn't needed much).

Another shortcut many take is to have someone else do the combine.  If it
took you a long time to get a rune for a level-20ish spell you want, why
risk that rune to your level-20ish research skill, if you can find someone
with much higher skill to do the combine for you?
