Yep, that's where they are.  That one is really not so valuable, but if you
really do need it it's not that hard to get there.  First get good maps from
http://www.eqatlas.com/.  Print them.  Then put on selos (got drum?) and
make a run for it.  Grimling forest is not bad.  Just don't run into the
grimling village.  Tenebrous mtns is kind of scary but just try not to run
into those really big wolves.  I have been there 3 times now and have never
been attacked yet.
