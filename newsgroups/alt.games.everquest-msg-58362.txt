Well the whole point of having a patcher is that the game can evolve slowly
from EQ1 into EQ2 over the space of a few years. Luclin will be a major
graphics update it seems, there are new characters, and zones. At some
point I wouldn't be suprised if they start to "retire" old zones in some way
and maybe replace them with new zones.

It wouldn't suprise me if a future patch modifes the engine to allow more
dynamic changes to scenery.

The number of people with broadband access is rapidly increasing which
means that at some point it will be possible to do much bigger patches than
they have previosuly done.

I don't think that EQ will ever die - I just thing that if you look at it in
3 years
it won't look anything like the game they have now.
