  I mostly lurk on this NG, but this one I had to reply to. I've
seen several guides to mastering different tradeskills quickly and
cheaply, but in my experience, none of them have been as quick or
cheap as reported. My wis is currently 280 unbuffed, not stellar but
hardly a drooling simpleton, and getting skill increases is still a
hit-or-miss thing. Sometimes I can get 2-3 increases out of a single
stack of combines (yay), and sometimes I have gone through 5-6
stacks without a single increase (/cries).

  Tradeskills can be the most frustrating thing in the world, or
very rewarding, depending on how you look at it and how the RNG is
treating you.  Personally, I'd hold off a little while before
dumping all my plat into it. A few more levels can make it quite a
bit easier to get plat to spend on tradeskills, and I'd hate to miss
out on spells and/or gear upgrades at the levels your chars are at.

  Whatever you decide to do, and whenever you decide to tackle
pottery again, best of luck to you on it!
