You will not evade me, Serefin <robartlejr@home.com>:

>In article <MPG.1608dab2e37bf949897a3@shawnews>, haha@ha.ha says...

>To Americans, yes. I'm American. I'm VERY proud of where I was born and

If this were just a regular scale act of terrorism like car bombs, I
wouldn't care more than I care about school children being shot at in
Ireland or suicide splint bombers in diners in Israel and Palestine.

Points:
1. I do care about 'regular' acts of terrorism.
2. This bombing goes way above and beyond 'regular' terrorism.

>Yes that's right. It SHOULDN'T happen here.

It shouldn't happen ANYWHERE.

>As I said, I'm an American 
>and I don't want it happening here. Again WHY should I care if someone 
>in East Timor dies in a bombing. Why should MY tax dollars go there to 
>help rebuild what someone else has destroyed??

Because you live on the same planet. Don't you realize how
coldhearted, selfish and narrow minded stuff like this makes you
sound?
How do you feel about European tax income being used to help the US in
this disaster?

>I could care less about 
>the "Protection Of The World". Why don't "they" care as much about those 
>daily terrorist attack daily in THEIR country. Do you hear an outcry at 
>every bomb that goes off in Jerusalem or Haifa? NO. Why? Because I'm

>grew up in NJ and know PLENTY of people who work in NY. 

Remember that the same goes for every 'regular' act of terrorism -
there's always someone who knows the victims. And I do hear about it
when buses get blown up etc... The outcry is less because I don't live
in the Middle East, and because blowing up buses doesn't kill
thousands and destroy immense values, both real and symbolic.

If someone had run a plane into a skyscraper in Shanghai and killed
thousands there, combined with crashing another plane into the Great
Wall, would you just shrug it off because it didn't happen in America?

Well, thank you for showing at least this shred of semi-decency in
your view of the world...
