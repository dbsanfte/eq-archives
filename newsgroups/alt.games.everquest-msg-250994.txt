Even though the guy says that he's gone for good, I'm going to state
this anyway.

All of your friends who had their lives ruined were probably lazy and
screwed up to begin with.  Yes, I've heard of the story of the guy who
locked himself away from his family in his house, went to addict
meetings, kept quitting pizza jobs, and eventually locked himself away
in his own apartment after moving out, then shot himself and was found
dead by his mother on Thanksgiving.  Yes, I've heard of the story about
the lady who forgot her kid in the car and let the child fry to death
because of EQ.  Yes, I've heard of the father who slammed his child
around in anger over EQ, which eventually lead to death.  Yes, I've
heard plenty of stories of relationship break ups, but when you take
all the stories you can find and put them in a ratio to total players
you won't find much to support your arguement.  What you are spouting
out is a bunch of ignorant slime.
