I've made the trip with multiple low level chars. If you are careful it's
doable. Kithicor is somewhat dangerous, and HHK/EK can be dicey, but I won
50pp with a Level 1 Gnome Magician coming in second place in a race from his
Ak'Anon home to Paineel. No ports, no buffs.

I still say the winner cheated.  (You could use translocators if they were
up because the boats were down, but the boats were fine that day. I was
right in front of him, jumped for the departing boat, I made it, he didn't.
He petitioned that he'd been there nearly an hour and no boat and a guide or
gm put the translocators up before I got to Erudin).

Go to eqatlas.com and get the map of Highpass hold. It's the toughest part
(If you get agro in kithcor, you die, but most of the time you can run the
right hand wall and be fine.)

You may want to get maps of East and North Karana as well, to give you an
idea where the 'camps' are, but it's mostly roaming spawns through there.
