It's not that I keep hearing the Plane of Tranquility bell in the distance,
or waking up at 2am realising I was dreaming about East Commons or Rathe
Mountains, or even the odd looks people give me when I re-enact casting
animations at the automatic doors at the supermarket.

It's the friends I miss :( I didn't realise how many people I would just
completely lose when I left EQ, or rather, when they left it.

I think this is a serious downside to the great experiment that is MMORPGs.
You make real friends, and when the game dies, you lose them.

Regards,
James
