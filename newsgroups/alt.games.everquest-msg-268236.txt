My favorite was the hidden valley (whatever it is called) with the very
high-con bears, that you can only get to down that loooong corridor.
That is when I discovered the true flair and panache of playing a cleric.
IE, you can't sneak, you can't invis, so you master the art of patiently
waiting for the perfect moment to run like a little girl for the
quest-trigger spot before you get killed (Tower of Zarvonn anyone?), then
try to run out.

I love my cleric. She's so...unsubtle.
