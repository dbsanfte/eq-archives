    Has this changed, then? When I put my first point in Research way back
when, I was set to 16 skill. Couldn't raise the skill until level 19. If you
read various sites on the subject, they all say the same thing.

    The rare, valuable spells have rare, valuable research items required to
make them. You can find the components for various semi-rare spells on
vendors, though, if you know where to look. I've obtained the pieces for
Call of the Hero, Illusion: Vah Shir, and Burnout IV that way. I also keep a
list of "what stuff makes what" beside my computer, as I've found several
semi-rare runes on vendors. This should help anyone that wants these things:
vendors in the popular places (like vendors in PoK and Tranq) are picked
over by people quickly, so you need to hit those fairly soon after a patch.
If you want someplace that won't have been picked over quickly but which is
a likely destination for high-level adventurers that don't know much about
research, think clerics and pottery.
