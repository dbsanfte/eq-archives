}I just feel that, if you want to introduce such a "baggage-laden"

"And pro-social skills".

}You are partially correct.  I did introduce the 2 yr old concept,

}However, this does not change the fact that it was Lena et al who

It's doable.

}So, if I understand you correctly, you are saying "Yes, a two year old
}is a little young to be introduced to HIV and AIDs.  A Five year old
}is better equipped to understand the concepts involved.."

I'd say a two year old can understand some of the concepts, a five year 
old can understand more... I don't think Sesame Street was discussing 
teaching any partthata two year old could not understand.

}Only up until the point that the parent feels the child can handle it.
}I will not now, nor will I *EVER* subscribe to the idea that,
}generally and overall, the government knows what is best for the
}child, rather then the parent.  

I think it is possible that some educators and child specialists know 
better than the parent.  A wise parent would trust them.  But I am yet to 
hear of legislation even being proposed requiring mandatory viewing of 
Sesame Street at any age.  So I believe the parent's rights are protected 
here, in any case.

}I seem to be somewhat alone in that belief.. 
}Now THERE's a novel concept, eh??  :^)

Given that you just said you were following up to someone who apparently 
agreed with you, yes, the idea of your alone-ness on that issue is rather 
novel.

}Buying into Lena et al's concept, one would have to believe that
}ANYTHING can be taught to ANY child, regardless of how young they are.

I'd say they have to be verbal.  Athough, that's only for ease of 
confirming that they learned it.  There has recently been some studies 
done that suggest that children understand a lot more of what you're 
saying before they are verbal than I, at least, would have thought.

}The PC crowd seems to think that you can teach a 2 yr old ANYTHING w/o
}ANY psychological or physiological negative impact.  
}I disagree with this.

So would I, and I suspect, so would Lesa.  However, I do believe you could 
teach them tolerance of people with HIV without the aforementioned 
negative impact.  I would not teach a child the gentle art of axe murder 
at any age, however.

}There are some things that simply MUST wait until the child is older.
}It's THAT simple..

So you keep saying.  But if it were THAT simple, everyone would agree with 
you.

}Yes I moved the bar down to 2 yr olds..  However unintentional it was,
}it was an error..
}But it did have the effect of proving my point..

Debatable.  

}The PC crowd *followed* the low bar down there and STILL tried to
}maintain a hold on their argument.

A hold that you have apparently yet to shake.

}One has to wonder if the bar was moved down to one year olds, would
}they STILL try to maintain their position is correct???

Well, see the comment about pre-verbalness above.

}If we start singling out specific conditions that we must be
}"tolerant" of, where should it end??
}Cancer Muppet??
}Heart Disease Muppet??
}12-Toed Muppet??

I'd support any of those.  Are you sure there hasn't been a muppet with 12 
toes already?  It sounds familiar.  I suspect, however, that there are 
more children in this country with HIV than any of those three conditions.
