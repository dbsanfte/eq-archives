It's not fucking welcome on Usenet, I don't give a rat's ass what they
"want to do". HTML belongs on the web, not on Usenet...and, in my
personal opinion, I despise getting html email, too.

See above.

It's people trying to be "trendy", and the trend is like fingernails
on a chalkboard....

>4. people begging for free stuff. if you dont like it ignore and move on.

Brats who think they deserve handouts deserve to get their asses
handed to them, even if it is only "verbally"...

Hey, here's an idea: Instead of bitching and moaning about what other
people bitch and moan about, why don't you practice what you preach,
hypocrite.
