The problem is too that you will have people with "unlimited" funds with 
uber characters ruling the game, while people with limited funds will 
live like real life.

For example.  If I'm Bill Gates, I basically have unlimited funds for 
the game and on day one can buy all the best stuff.

For example.  If I'm Average Joe, my disposable income per month is 
about $1,000.  I can only buy AT MOST $1,000 worth of game stuff...So 
I'm always only going to have a character that is behind the power curve.
