Sorry, that's bullshit. It is an excuse, that's all there is to it.
People don't want to take accountability for their own actions and
make an effort to change their habits out of respect for others, so
they cry about how horrible it is they're punished for "impulsive"
actions.

Funny how people who have so little control over blurting out
obsceneties in EQ never do so in, say, a church...
