That's the main use I was referring to as well.  Helpful when a cleric
lags (and it does happen) and a tank dies or Feigns (after announcing
he's going to) and that next tank has built up a lot of aggro but the CHeal
chain isn't recovering so well.  Which can also happen, even with level
60 clerics with 3 years under their belt and tons of AA and good gear.

The unexpected happening is what still makes the game a bit fun, especially
when it shows the usefullness of an experienced/intelligent player/guild
over
a zerg horde.  Heck, even my rogue has had to use nimble before when
running into a new area as the guild comes in to set up camp and finds
a new mob, or a badly-pathed mob, or a stuck mob.  Defensive, like Nimble-
but-better, is completely incredible for buying the rest of the guild the
few
seconds it needs in the officer channel to decide and implement new plans
or a quick last-ditch try to at least learn something about a mob.

I was like "so," then read "unbuffed."
Um...I'm wondering if in the PoP expansion some guildees will have their
accounts taken away by GM's to be played as Demi-gods, like in the pen/paper
days :-).
