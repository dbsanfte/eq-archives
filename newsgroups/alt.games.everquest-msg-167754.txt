I'm beginning to need a change of airs from Jaggedpine Forest, and I've 
been told I ought to try Umbral Plains... Unfortunately, I feel greed 
and cowardice pulling me in opposite directions. On the one hand, the 
Elysian BP and legs look really sweet (although I have no interest in 
any of the other pieces), but on the other hand, I've read scary things 
about aggro from miles away, trains at the zone line and see-invis mobs, 
and a lamentable scarcity of clerics to clean up after inconvenient 
deaths.

So, realistically... Would a foray into that scary zone be a good 
investment, or is it more likely to turn into a nightmare of unrezzed 
deaths?
