Warriors are broken currently; their aggro is too low to allow their 
group mates to do their best output.  So paladins and shadowknights, 
once the two least desired classes in the game, are now kings of the MA 
game.

Fix warriors completely, as you suggest here, though, and you break 
paladins and SKs.

When they nerfed monks, they screwed one class and helped what, 6?

Its not fair that warriors suck, but its even more unfair to put two 
classes back into the hell of 6 hour LFGs just to fix one class. Worse 
in this case because those two classes already know the pain of those 
years of undesirability, and only recently came into their own.

All that provocative stuff said, warriors don't seem to suck as bad as 
I've heard people say recently.  Played last night with a group in our 
50s, with a 49 warrior as MA.  Many times I went to flat out nuking as 
fast as I could, chaining shock of blades with my haste summon and BOF, 
or chaining Scars of Sigil (2 sec cast time) literally non stop till my 
mana blew out, and I only got aggro once, after casting 4 in a row and 
then sitting immediately.  Nobody else got aggro with the exception of 
the shaman, who did get hit several times after casting slow and 
curse... both apparantly high aggro spells.  This was decidedly not a 
twinked out warrior, although she did have a couple proccing weapons 
that went off frequently what with shaman buffs and Boon boosting her 
dex to the cap.
