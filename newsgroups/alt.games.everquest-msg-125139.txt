You seem to be one of the exceptions Rastus, I have tried different sound
options with Win2k, and some sucked less than others, but none were all that
great.  I still prefer using Win2k because the stability is just so much
superior to any Win9x I have ever used.  As I understand it, with Win2k you
also lose EAX, but, I don't actually know.  Sound was very nice with Win95,
back before SoL, and sound has been crappy ever since I went to Win2k,
including pre SoL.
