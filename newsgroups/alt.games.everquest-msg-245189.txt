200-300 hours is casual? "Good lord" is right. That's a full time job... 
hell a full time job is *less* than that!! 300 hours a month is spending 
12.5 straight days a month in EQ ... that's more than a 3rd of your life...

Hard to say. I see where you are coming from... but I can't see a HC 
raid guild taking a few days a month off their normal server to try and 
PL in a restricted server. It would just slow down their mains.

And no HC guild is going to make it their main server... because they 
simply will want to play more.

Discord was a time limited special rules gank fest... it was a breif 
diversion. I seriously doubt any hard core guilds dropped raiding to do 
it... it was more of an off-time thing to do... instead of goofing with 
alts or tradeskills for a month.

I suppose even if it was perceived and engaged as a challenge server, 
the casual player base on it would still benefit... sure they might not 
be the top end as I'd hoped, but neither would they be nearly as far 
behind as they are everywhere else; because they are just losing out on 
the 'organization'... they aren't also being out time-sinked by a factor 
of 5 or 6 as well. It still levels the play field considerably.
