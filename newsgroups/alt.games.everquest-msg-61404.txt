Here's how you spend your plat.  Sit down at the tunnel in the commons for a
night or two and learn the prices on stuff.

Find a diamond selling for 300pp, buy it and turn around and sell it for
500.  You now have 700pp.

Find a Mithril BP selling for 500 and turn around and sell it for 800 You
now have 1k.

 Find a Sarnak Skullspitter that is being dumped for 1k, turn around and
sell it for 2k.

Buy a wurmy for 2k, sell it for 2,500 - 3K.

Repeat... Repeat....

I've made a lot of money buying low and selling average.  I've seen so many
items go for cheap because people want to unload them in a hurry.  Learn the
prices and get rich.  You can also get burned on some trades so proceed with
caution, shout price checks, and check the prices on the web before you
commit to anything unless you are sure.

The other day I hade a Book of Obulus I was trying to sell for 6k.  A guy
offered to trade me some crystal chitin armplates for it.  I took the trade
and started advertising them for 10k.  Another guy came along and wanted the
armplates and offered me an Etched Veliuim War Lance for the armplates.  I
took that deal.  In an hour I went from having 6k to 12k worth of stuff.

It can be done.
