True.

I have always been able to tank well enough for a group that was close
to my level.  And I'm generally better at off-tanking adds or stepping
in should the MA fall, because I can get lots of agro fast.  But I have
never felt that I could tank "as well or better than a [comparably
equipped same level] Warrior" in a group.  At lower levels Wariors have
more HP, more AC (higher level cap for Defense plus Warrior gear is
higher AC than comparable Paladin gear), and more MR.  In the mid-50s
Wariors have more HP, more AC (skill caps are same, gear gap is still
there), and more MR.  Situationally, if mana regen buffs are not
available the Warrior gains a lot vs. Paladin because his ability to
generate agro fight after fight is not mana limited.  Situationally,
if a group has no Cleric the Paladin gains in value because his buffs
are quite a bit better than nothing.  Situationally, if mob casters are
few or gimped the Paladin has less to contribute to combat, conversely
if mob casters are plentiful the Paladin gains greatly in value,
especially if mana regen buffs are available so he can cast freely.

The second Warrior in our Seb group the other night was outdamaging
me noticeably, tho he was a level lower.  When he left we got a L56
Rogue to replace him and we had a much easier time keeping the mobs
in our area cleared, even tho the BattleCleric(tm) stopped jumping
into the fights shortly after the Rogue joined.  That simple little
change to the dynamics of our camp says more about the difference
between Warrior/Knight damage output and what the "real" killers can
do than any amount of log parsing:  the L56 Rogue did so much more
damage than L53 Warrior plus L56 Cleric that we went from constant
combat to one to three minute pauses between pulls waiting for mobs
to pop.

At that point the Necro graciously loaned his spare lounger to the
Cleric, while the Enchanter continued cracking the whip over, er, ah,
supervising, um, hrm, encouraging, that's it, encouraging, the melees.
