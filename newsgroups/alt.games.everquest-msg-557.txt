I have the distinct impression that Shadow Knights are a harder class
to play. I've never played one myself, so I don't know.

The tinkering skill is still over-rated, from what I hear. There may
be some improvements to it in the future, but apparently right now
it's an exercise in frustration. Don't base character selection on the
trade skills.

Otherwise, Gnome wizards are pretty cool, and that would be my choice
from your list.

An impossible question to answer, since it will vary by player.

Ahhh, I remember that well. My first Big Trip as a newbie. Took my
little dwarf, who was by no means ready to leave the damp comfort of
Butcherblock, and hopped him onto the boat. Spent an hour totally lost
in Freeport, then found my way onto the Commons. No sense heading
skill to speak of, no map, and no guide. I almost fainted when I saw
my first giant spider. And I died horribly when I saw my first lion.
Bind point? What's a bind point? Had to make the trip from
Butcherblock again, hoping against hope that my meager gear wasn't
lost for good.

I envy you, I really do - that was an *enormous* amount of fun.

That leads eventually to the North Desert of Ro. It's a slightly
wilder zone than the East Commons, but more or less on a par challenge
wise.
