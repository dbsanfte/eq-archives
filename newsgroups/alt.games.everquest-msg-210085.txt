For two players of the same level, xp is shared equally, however, 
different  races do have different bonuses/penalties to levelling.  For 
example, a Halfling needs 90% (or is it 95%) of the xp of a Human to 
level.  An Ogre needs 115% (I think that's the value) of the xp of a 
human to level.  There used to be class penalties as well, but those have 
been removed (well, kludged out).

So, if you are a halfling rogue, and he is an iksar monk, then there will 
be a noticable difference.
