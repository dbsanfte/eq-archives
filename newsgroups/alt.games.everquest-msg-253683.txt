If you are interested in exploits, then you should check out Bug Bytes. The
membership fee is very reasonable, and we even have a free trial period. The
URL is http://www.bugbytes.tk

As for the people that flame this post...the subject states what my purpose
is. Don't read it if you aren't interested in exploits, or exploit sites.
