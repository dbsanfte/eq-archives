I run a Toshiba Tecra 8100 - same video chipset.  Worked great until
the last patch.  I read elsewhere that there's some sort of issue with
ATI video...  apparently in 'full screen' mode.  

As soon as I can figure out what to change the line: 

ScreenMode=FULL

from eqclient.ini I'll give it another shot.  

Needless to say I'm quite bummed about the whole thing.
