JUST dinged 54 tonight with my druid.  Got all my spells for this
level except for Remove Greater Curse, which I'm not totally convinced
is necessary, and now I'm thinking about my level 55 spells.  More
specifically, I'm thinking about my pet.

How much does Nature Walkers Behest usually sell for?  I'd be
surprised if it goes for less than 20k, unfortunatly....
