Actually the point was that if Verant was "pro newbie", they would have placed
newbie content in any expansion, even one that was advertised as being for high
level content. Not a far fetched assumations in argument about Verant being "pro
newbie".

Personally, I believe Verant is neither "pro newbie" or "pro high level". I think
they are more "pro Verant" and "pro standard company profit lines". This is natural
of any company that is catagorized as a non-Not-for-Profit company.
