Yup, during the most recent anniversary month I used this technique
with just a druid for tracking, and it worked great.  Some folks have
posted lists of possible PHs, and it seems not all the trash mobs can
appear as PH, so if you just keep tracking and killing trash mobs from
the PH list, eventually most of them respawn as other types of trash,
while the Quillmane spawn will always be one of the mobs from the list.
Pretty soon you're left with only a few (often just one) possible PH
spawns at the top of the time-sorted tracking list, and if you keep
killing that one you'll get QM pretty quick.

And the great thing about the Fabled version is that it ALWAYS drops
the Fabled cloak, which doesn't work for the Mage epic but is fine if
all you wanted was a Levitation item. :-)

On a more general note, however, I have to take issue with the OP's
claim that "the zones and mobs and quests involved have been changed
sufficiently over the years that answering these questions would not
give away anything relevant to the current game".  It's clear that
the Quillmane spawn is still relevant.  People still quest for jboots,
so the AC spawn is still relevant.  I'd never heard about the GBS
before this thread so I have no idea if it's still relevant.
