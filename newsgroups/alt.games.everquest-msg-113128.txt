Heh.  Hope you enjoy sitting around LFG.   You'll be waiting quite a while to
put togheter a "perfect" group each and every time.   Not to mention, just
because some dipshit chose a "required" class... they're not any less of a
dipshit.    A well played paladin would help any party a hell of a lot more
than an idiot twink rogue.
