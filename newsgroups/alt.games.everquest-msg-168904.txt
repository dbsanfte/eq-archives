I've never seen anyone hunting spiders in FV.  Could happen, mind you, I've just
never seen it, regardless of time of day.

The spiders wander around spread out fairly well, if you've run into a dozen
coming out of the tunnel, I'd bet thats because someone coming IN to the tunnel
brought them there.  Might actually be more frequent at busy times.. but not
something I've ever seen either.
