Agreed.  Personally I find that having these Soulbinders take part of
the challenge out of the game and remove another method of character
interaction.  I have made many friends simply because in a short
period of time I needed a lot of binds and a certain person happened
to be around a lot.

Exactly.  For almost a week straight I was bound in Rivervale while
fighting in The Overthere.  Died a couple times yes, but simply looked
for a Revive which was often available from the group Cleric.
