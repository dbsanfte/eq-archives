  What more do you want for them to say that they are aware of the
problem and are presumably working on a fix?  It wouldn't exactly be
time or cost effective for them to send all 200 or 2,000 or 20,000 (or
however many people) are suffering these issues a handwritten email.
Once they have established that there is a problem with a specific
piece of hardware or software, there's not a lot they can be expected
to say, other than "we know about it, we're working on it"... which I
believe they've said.

  Oh, I can think of one thing that would be nice to hear: "We're
sorry, we are instituting new and more thorough testing methodologies
to reduce the chances of something like this happening again" or maybe
"We will be crediting your Sony Station account with $10 to help
convey our sincere apologies for the disruption in service that you
have suffered."

  Don't hold you breath, though.
