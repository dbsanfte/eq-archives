Here's a small quote from the www.eqtraders.com news page:

"One big revelation was this: Gates of Discord was intended to work with a
level cap increase to be released on the 5th anniversary of Everquest.
Because of this the zones were tuned for level 68 or 70, making it the WAY
too difficult beast that we faced."

I read elsewhere (can't find the source atm) that SoE was supposed to
raise our level to 70 for the 5th Anniversary and to level 75 in the next
expansion.

Anyone happen to catch the reason SoE didn't raise us to 70 during the 5th
Anniversary?

Thanks.
