Hey,

Thanks guys.  I appreciate the advice.  All will be taken into 
consideration and many tried.....

Those folk that said it didn't matter.....

Have I been reading it wrong to assume that the higher your defense skill 
was the less hp you take when you are hit, or is it just that you don't 
get hit as often?

Either way, don't you think it's best to get leveled up for your level, 
thus making it easier each following level to level (lot of levels, I 
know!) in the skill.  Or do you really think it doesn't matter to be 
maxed to the nth in the melee and defense?

Or, is it just a matter of personal preference?  Ok, I might not be 
making what I want to know at this moment clear..... Does anyone have 
personal experience or know of an instance where not being maxed out on 
your abilities matters diddley squat?

I mean, is it normal for a blue to hit you maybe 4 times and reduce your 
hp to half?  If that happens even when you are maxed, then I can see why 
you would just focus on the avoidance of being hit.

Again, these are some fine responses and I appreciate it.
