diablo2 was so great cuz u didnt have to pay to play online. it just isnt
fair paying for the game and then paying for meeting other people and play
online. it kind of takes the whole concept of internet down.

>>Wonder how many times D2 went crapOla on you guys while playing. Second
statement.... uhhhh....duh.

hey, i'm not a hacker, i dont mind paying for a game if i know i can play it
whenever i want. paying for it makes u think ur wasting money while ur not
online.

>> Good. Now I can rest in peace knowing some guy working for "Mozzila"
won't hack into my system. Uhh what about paying your monthly internet cost?
Uhhhh...

sux. i wont play along

>> Awww!

And considering i did most of the mozzila browser design work i consider
myself... smart*

>> Hey I dont work for them, but isn't it Mozilla??  Bet your boss is mad at
you now for misrepresenting Mozilla! ouch.  Mozzila + smart = dumb

Even though i can't agree on paying to play mmrpg games. IT SHOULD BE
FREE!!!! why? I already pay for my internet access (go find the meaning of
internet b4 flaming again plz) and thus, it should be free to interact with
other people online! It's like paying for every word u say on the telephone
when u phone ur friends! just not fair.

>> Whine and crackers! Want some cheese with it too??  One word sums this
up: DUH! Go chat on "Teen" at MSN Chat or something.Better yet, graduate
from High School.
