Re-read the thread again.  Most of the complaints we have stated are people
who come up to us and say, "Can I have plat plz?" "Can I loot your kills?"
"Can you give me some money?" "Can you buff me plz?"...

Personally... People who come up to my druid get ignored fast like that.
Especially ones who use the excuse of "I'm new, can I have some money plz?"

Now, if a person takes the effort to type out 'please' and not ask for
something, just some information, I am more than willing to help.  It isn't
we aren't intolerant about newbies, just the newbies who think begging for
the 'better' stuff instead of showing an attempt to work with what you got
first.
