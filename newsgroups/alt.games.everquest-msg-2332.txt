Probably longer than a year ago they used to have extremely optimistic
downtime estimates.  It was an ongoing joke that to find out the true down
time, multiply the estimate by 1.5 and that will be the actual minimum.

It's been at 8 hours for a few months at least and the worst *I* have
noticed is an actual downtime of 8:15.  Not too shabby at all.  I'm thinking
that if they're giving a 10 hr estimate today it's probably going to be a
big one.  It's almost 10 hours now...wonder when they're coming back up...
www.everquest.com isn't working for me right at this moment so I can't
check.
