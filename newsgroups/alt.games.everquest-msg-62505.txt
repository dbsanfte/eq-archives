I had that happen when got a virus, was one called "funlove" or
something. It added itself to all the EXE files, the patch program
would always try and reupgrade itself, the crc was wrong in main eq
program and crashed.    Finally did a full virus scan and fixed the
problem. It had infected over 3600 files.
