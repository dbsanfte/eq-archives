I say "quasi-" because my mage is 28 now, and the best I have to help him 
level is a 53 shaman, 36 druid or a 36 enchanter on my other account. Up to 
this point, I've just been logging the enchanter for mind buffs and haste, 
then logging the shaman for pet buffs and heals. Stoicism has been working 
pretty well, enabling me to tank effectively with my fire pet.

I was also levelling up a warrior recently, and I found it *much* easier, 
as I could use Skinspike potions and he can really take a hit well. 
Unfortunately, mage pets don't drink potions (that I know of), and my mage 
runs screaming like a little girl if a mob so much as scowls at him.

How do people PL casters? Any ideas for my particular situation? I don't 
have too far to go before my higher level characters can just group with 
him, but I'd like to bridge that gap quickly.
