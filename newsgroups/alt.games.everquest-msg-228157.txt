Still no.  If you need an item, either to upgrade yourself or to sell
in order to buy something to upgrade yourself, that is not necessarily
greed.  It is not synonymous.  Greed is when you push that your "need"
is such that you get not only the required item but further items as
well.

In re going to one LDoN dungeon in preference to another, that also
isn't greed.  Again, there is no exact correlation between being
self-serving and being greedy.  You're trying to say that if I don't
go where *you* want, I'm being greedy.  That isn't the case.
