There are two distinct components to a Tank, and I specifically said
doing damage... Dodge, parry, and riposte are irrelevant to that,
I'm certainly not suggesting that would be as good at sponging
up damage as a real tank.

I was doing quite a bit better than 1/10th the damage output of
the tanks in my group, somewhere between 1/4th and 1/5th, based
on the short time I had "other's hits" turned on.  Not that this is a
big deal by any means, average group has 3 melee in it, so thats
1/15th the total melee output, and probably has a nuker too, who
may be doing more damage than a tank per mob...  putting my
meager output at 1/20th the group total.

Procs 3 or 4 times a fight on its own, or 4 or 5 times a fight if I'm hasted,
or 5 to 6 times a fight if I also have have WW form on (dex seems to
make a difference but not a huge one) Resists are rare against blue to
me mobs, or against any mob if the target is being resist debuffed.
Oddly it even works on BW giants, I thought giants were immune to
stun effect?  I've never seen a partial resist, either its full damage or
no effect.

The stun, like all my usual cleric stuns, lasts about 6 seconds.  Since
I can't predict it, though, it doesn't play a useful part in interrupting
a mob, nor in the occaisional "full time stun" plan I can lay down by
carefully timing 3 stun spells so as to prevent a mob from acting at all.
