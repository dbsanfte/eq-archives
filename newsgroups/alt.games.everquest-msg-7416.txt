Cultural armor is player made stuff that can only be made by
a specific race in their own native special forge.  It is quite
difficult
to make (ie fails frequently unless you have a very high skill) and
requires difficult to aquire materials, as well as expensive store
bought materials.  Each type of cultural can only be worn by
specific races, and has its own characteristics.

In addition to the racial restrictions, cultural armor can be imbued,
which is to say a gem imbued by a cleric of a given religion can
be included in the matierals while making it.  This gives additional
stat bonuses to the armor, but restricts its use to -only- followers
of that cleric's religion.  The smith does not have to be the cleric
who imbued the gem, in fact he need not even be a member
of the religion in question.  However, there seem to be restrictions
as to which racial armors can get gems from which religions

To make a piece of top of the line cultural, you need a highly
skilled smith, a brewer (to make the temper) a relatively high
level enchanter (to enchant the metal, the spell is not a low
level one) and a mid level cleric of the appropriate religion,
Imbue spells are all 29th level.

Oddly, the smith and brewer (might as well be the same
person) can be as low as 1st level, although most will take
a gate capable caster with gate, in order to cut down on
running around time... Maxed wis or int and str are the
key elements, and at high end, getting great equipment
to get those as high as you can are key.  If you are trying
to make cultural for your main character, you should look
closely at what precisely this would be; unfortunately
the effort and expense involved in most cases is a waste
of time and effort, since by the time you can realistically
get the materials for making the temper, you'll be able to
loot/aquire better armor off of mobs.

Dwarven cleric/paladins of Brell may be an exception, thier
cultural is a plate that has better than FS stats and is all
+4str/+4wis or better... an excellent combo.

My first smith was a high elf cleric, though, and the sad
thing is that Tunare Mithril is +wis/+int... there is no
class out there that uses -both- these stats!  Yes, this
means that the armor is the most flexible, as any caster
healer or spell using hybrid can make use of one or the
other, but unless you plan on trading the armor back
and forth between various characters, flexibility isn't
really much of a virtue, what you want is stuff fine tuned
to your own needs.
