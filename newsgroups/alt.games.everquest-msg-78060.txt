...or not.  He should go looking for his corpse, it may well
still be there.  It sounds as if he isn't even aware what
happened to his belongings or how to (attempt to) retrieve
them.

Note for newbies:  When you die (normally, or indirectly
due to a game crash), your corpse will remain lying where
you died, and will have all your equipment/money on it.
Go back to where you died, find your corpse, right-click on
it to loot it (the same way you loot any monster corpse),
and pick up your stuff.

Newbie corpses rot somewhat quickly, but not as fast as
monster corpses.  And not as fast as the manual claims they
do, either.  Always try to go back and check for your corpse.
Once you're past level 5, you have lots of time to get your
corpse, they last 24 hours if you're online, or a full
week if you're offline (or a pro-rated combination of the
two if you've been both online and offline since you
died).
