At my level it's an additional 7 points per tick. At level 60 that increases
to 11 (I've heard 12 also so I'm not 100% sure), that's better than
Chloroplast, and pretty close to a Fungi Tunic's 15 points per tick.

It's 42 AC at level 60. I haven't gotten there yet, but I'd gladly accept a
piece of armor with an additional 42 AC.

I'd disagree really. As beastlords we get STA buffs as early as level 22 adn
then again at 39. At level 52 you get Health which raises your STA by about
30 points. We never get a WIS buff.
