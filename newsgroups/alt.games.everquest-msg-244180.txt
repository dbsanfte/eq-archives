It shrinks the viewscreen and creates unused black space around
the edges, like watching a "letterbox" movie on a standard TV.

Then you can put the chat window, group window, spellcasting gems
etc. in the unused space, so they don't obscure any part of the
viewscreen.

The general format of the command is

  /viewscreen x1 y1 x2 y2

where x1,y1 and x2,y2 are the pixel coordinates of the two corners
of the viewscreen.
