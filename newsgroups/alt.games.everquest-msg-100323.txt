  You make it sound as if they gave away those expansions for free.  The
fact that more bandwidth is being consumed and more servers are necessary
indicates a growing customer base, which means more revenue... I doubt if
the amount of bandwidth each player consumes while playing has increased
significantly.  The cost of the computer hardware necessary to put up those
new servers to support the growing customer base also has probably followed
a downward trend over the years.  And I don't think there's been 30%
inflation over the past 3 years.

  Though maybe it was something they needed to do to remain profitable (or,
more likely, maintain the profit margins they've become accustomed to) for
reasons I'm not comprehending.  I suppose it's possible that in the long run
they have "taken a loss" on the new expansion content, despite the initial
revenue boost from people buying the expansions.

  I'm not happy about it, and for %30 more per month, I'm hoping to at least
see some sort of measurable improvement in customer service and a general
stepping up of the quality of service with regards to quality control and
the prompt fixing of bugs... but since there's no such assurance noted on
the page notifying us of the price hike, I guess it's crazy to think that
will be the case.  I'm also troubled that just a few months after the
chaotic and rushed release of their last expansion, they've announced yet
ANOTHER expansion and I've still seen no "official" recognition or apology
for the huge mess that was for many of us.  Things are looking pretty
bleak... paying more for the same level of service with an impending
expansion, that if history repeats itself will be ridden with bugs that will
result in months of fruitless troubleshooting and various annoying issues,
with the perk of having "new content" to enjoy that a year from now I still
probably won't have a character high in level enough to enjoy.

  But I suppose it's greedy for me to think only of how this will affect me.
At least Verant has an excuse, they're a business, it's their job to be
greedy. :P
