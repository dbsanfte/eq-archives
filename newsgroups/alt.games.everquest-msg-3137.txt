It was a way of getting around them.  That I understand.

Sure there are. . They are called Large Bags.  A BP weighs 3 and holds
8.  A Large Bag weighs 1 and holds 6.  As you said, you are not going
to be toting around a lot of stuff anyways.  A large bag only loses
you a couple spots and if you have a tailor make you a tailored large
bag or just work to low level tailoring (around 31 or 36) you can make
your own and make a bunch of silk bandages along the way that you guys
like so much because they are lighter.

Of course the nice players would simply offer to sell the stuff for
the monk.  Or hold it until then.  =)

IT was the least complicated solution to people crying because they
were using kits as bags because and accidentally hitting combine
instead of DONE.   With the way they fixed the combine issue (which I
disagreed with) there had to be some compensation.  Increasing the
weight so that everyone didnt just go get 7 or 8 tailoring kits was
the quick solution.  Read my solution on how tradeskill kits should
work in another thread and tell me if that wouldnt solve the "only
combinable items" should  be able to go in there.

Who knows, maybe you can make them=)  Now that you dont lose the items
we might just find out=)  But that is a great idea.  Heck, I dont even
have a problem with them being Monk specific like the armor is.  Cost
to make wouldnt be insane, ingredients wise.  Or better yet make them
Cured Silk Bags.  Weight .4  Monks or Pure Casters only.

They do tend to do that in a rush to get things they are fixing "out
by the next patch, we will make them perfect later".  Perhaps Verant
hired some old employees from Microsoft=)
