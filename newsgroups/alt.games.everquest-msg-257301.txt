Is it at all possible to max out faction with all SH clans? Has anyone
managed?

I ask as I've been repeatedly doing the 'supplies' run between the Barb
merchant in SH and the Gnome in Bazaar to increase faction with the
different clans in SH for my TS alt (Halfling Druid). Also, faction with SH
merchants maxed out quite rapidly.

However, faction with House of Fordel and the other 2 (which I can't recall
atm) haven't maxed out though I've done at least twice as many deliveries as
it took me to max out faction with the SH merchants.

Is the quest simply intended to not max out faction or am I just getting
impatient?

TIA
