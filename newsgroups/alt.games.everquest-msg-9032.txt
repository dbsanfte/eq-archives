It's tough grouping until you get the spell that every caster drools over.
Clerics have trouble finding groups at level 38, 48, and 55 for the same
reason (the level before xp rez, or upgrade).

Unless you continue hunting with that group I think I'd just solo until I
hit 16, take the trip to FV and buy Breeze.  Then you'll have a lot easier
time finding a group.

:Languid Pace slows down how fast the critters hit.  It doesn't slow down
their feet.  Shaman slow critters better, but enchanters don't do a bad job
of it, and it IS a handy spell to have if you can afford to cast it
(expensive mana).

Have you gotten at least one copy of page 26 left & right?  I strongly
suggest you buy your Research book and carry it, with those pages, around
with you all the time until you find a high level enchanter wiht maxed
Research skill to hit Combine for you.  That's the AE mez spell and a damned
important one for quite some time...you don't really want to fail that one.

What do you do when the 2 critters are smashed into each other?  Well,
target the primary tank and hit /assist.  At least now you'll see which one
you DON'T want to mez.  After that it just takes practice clicking on the
other one.  Even at 51 I find it's annoyingly difficult.  But if you have a
decent healer and you only have those 2 critters, don't worry too much about
it.  Target and mez it when you can.

Oh, btw, when you do /assist you should NOT be autoattacking as well.  If
you haven't typed in the command "/assist off" yet, please do it the next
time you log in.  Oh, sure, at level 15 you're probably still doing some
melee but you can always do /assist then turn on autoattack.
