Unless they changed it, and I'm pretty sure they haven't, forage will always
refresh every 1:40 and nothing will speed that up.

Don't

I believe druid max Hide is 50 which you'd hit by level 9.  Sneak is a
Halfling race benefit, right?  Druids don't get that skill...whatever your
sneak skill is at is all the higher it'll go.  Only rogues can sneak, hide
and move at the same time...you probably knew that, but I wasn't sure so I
thought I'd mention it.
