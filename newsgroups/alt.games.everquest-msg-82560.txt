Helmut is most likely correct:  it was simply a cost cutting measure/profit
increasing business decision that took the maps away.

The tutorial is a different matter.  Someone created a zone explorer program
that used the official tutorial program to allow you to explore many of the
game's zones offline.  Gave folk planning a raid to certain zones a bit of a
pre-planning advantage, I guess.  Verant sees it as an exploit.  Their way
of dealing with it?  Making the tutorial unavailable anymore.

I recall someone saying earlier that if you had the tutorial before, it
won't work anymore because Verant disabled it.  I'll have to check to see if
that's still true or not.  It's been a very long time since I tried it.
