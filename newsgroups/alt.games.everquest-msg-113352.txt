I have a Warrior approaching 20 today. He has been SoW's once on a drive
by and buffed only once as well. Both occurrences during his 18th
season. My point is that it is not only possible, but easy to operate
within the self imposed limits of your race/class without pestering
others. I never have and never will request enhancements of any kind
from other alts. Begging is begging.... If you want SoW create an alt
that can SoW.
