IS there a really safe way across Antonica from Qeynos to Freeport? I would
try Qeynos, Hills, West - North - East Karana. From there I could go via the
HighHold zones into Klithicor or up via the Gorge, thru Runnyeye and Misty
Thicket, and finally thru RiverVale, and drop down into Klithicor forest.
However I really dont like the descriptions on eqatlas on that place. Sounds
very bad. Is there any way to Freeport which dont involve Klithicor. Any
route which leads into the Commons I expect. I could port but that's
expensive way to travel, and I cant keep asking my Druid chums to keep doing
it for free!

TIA
