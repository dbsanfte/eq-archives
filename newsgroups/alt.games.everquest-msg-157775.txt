"drop like candy"???  I've killed hundreds of JP gnolls and never
seen it drop.  The one drop I've gotten there that I really liked
was a Gnoll Forged Bracer (think that's the right name), which is
an AC 11 chain bracer (no big deal) that's royal blue in color
(a color I've not otherwise seen with chain), I'd love to get a
full set of visible pieces for my Ranger, not only is it a nice
looking color, but it'd be an unusual look besides.
