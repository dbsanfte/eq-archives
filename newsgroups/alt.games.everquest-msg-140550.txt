If the 5.8 number is correct, then 30 is indeed the magic level.  But
I gave the formula incorrectly (put the +2 in the wrong spot).  So
Jim's result (using my error) was a wee bit off, his example character
would have about half the mana he computed.

for stat up to 200:  ((stat / 5) + 2) * level
for stat over 200:    (42 * level) + ((stat - 200) * 5.8)
