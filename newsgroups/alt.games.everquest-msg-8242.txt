The first 10 slots are reserved for my running spells (gate, yonder,
dd's, root...the set i keep memmed almost all the time), and a couple i
swap in and out occasionally. The next page is for buffs. Next is my
gate spells, then after that portals, then after that evacs, then after
that is all the crap i never use.
