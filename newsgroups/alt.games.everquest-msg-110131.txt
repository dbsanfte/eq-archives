Combo, Im on a p2 400, tnt 16 meg agp card and the only thing I needed
for all luclin models and animations was more ram. I have 576 meg of
ram now and it was a 60 dollar upgrade to be able to play Luclin
pretty damn well with Low textures and clipping down.

So getting to 512 meg of ram for you would be your best bet for
luclin, as long as you had textures set at low in options. In testing
this, cacheman shows that I use a whopping 450 MORE meg of an 800 meg
perm swap file if i have textures set at the default high (thats with
576 meg of mem) with textures set to low I average 390 or so meg of
swap file use after I leave an EQ session (both ways I always use all
576 meg of ram during it)

The next biggest upgrade would be at least a geforce 3 ti 64 meg card,
or wait for the geforce 4 4200 128 meg card for $199, which is the
best deal really at the moment. Lastly I'd worry about your MB and
processor. For this kind of game, where you are mostly slowed down by
the textures on players and in the enviornment, its memory, memory,
memory, then when in doubt, some more memory.

My upgrade path, with a system similar to yours is:

1) memory,  (done)

2) Geforce 4 4200, 128 meg when out (not out yet that I've seen, but
I'm patient)

3) celeron 1 ghz proc for 99 bucks and a mother board that can use the
type of 576 meg of pc 133 ram that I use now for about 99 bucks.

Toss all tht into my current case, game again for 3 or so more years
for a total of 400 bucks (at the point where I am now, since I have
the memory)
