I think this is a great idea in theory, but would never work.  Even if we
could get a concensus about what questions should go in and how they should
be answered, chances are nobody would read it.

Have you seen Verant's FAQ?  It answers a lot of questions, yet folks
*still* ask the same questions on whineplay.  Worse still, VI *still*
answers those questions, even though they are answered in the FAQ <rubs his
temples vigorously>.

If you do go ahead, please add the following questions which I see
repeatedly <G>:

-Where's a good place to hunt for a [insert class/lvl here]?

-What are some good web pages for info on [insert EQ related problem here]?

-What kind of gear should I have for a [insert race/class/lvl here]?

-Is there an xp Bonus for having a full group?  (no)
