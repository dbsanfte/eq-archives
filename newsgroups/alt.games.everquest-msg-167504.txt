I keep hearing things like this said.  Now tell me, does that mean:

You have been hit for 3500!
You have been hit for 3500!
You have been hit for 3500!
You have been hit for 3500!

And if so, where'd you find anyone who could take a whole quad to determine 
that it quad attacks?

Or does it (more likely in my mind) mean

You have been hit for W!
You have been hit for X!
You have been hit for Y!
You have been hit for Z!

Where W+X+Y+Z is about 3500?
