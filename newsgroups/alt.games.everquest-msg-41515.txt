   The USA will determine that that terrorist Osama Lin Baden was responsible
for the attack. So far, everything points to him, they even found a cell phone
linked to him. But Afganistan has him under tight security, and will refuse to
believe that he was responsible for the attack.
   The USA will want custody of him, and Afganistan will refuse. This will
cause the president to declare to give him up in one week or we will go to war
with Afganistan. Since we are going to war with Afganistan, a muslim country,
all the countries that dont like us will join thier side. And all the countries
that are our friends will join our side.
   What does everyone think of this therory of what will happen? I am confident
100% that this will happen in the following days to few weeks.
