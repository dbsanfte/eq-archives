I've only been playing EQ2 for 4 days now, it's my first time ever using a
server, and I found more fun and camaraderie with the players. I loved my
first raid, and now that I've left Isle of Refuge and headed to Freeport,
maybe I'll run into some of the stuff you're talking about. But I also
helped less experienced players with trains--and gained heroic experience!
I also stood on a hill, watching the choo-choo run by (they look funny).

I'm sure I've got a lot to learn, but this is a whole new world and I'm
having a blast.
