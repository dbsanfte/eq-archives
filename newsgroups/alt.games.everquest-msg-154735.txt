Thanks everyone for the info.
I finally got up and running.
It only took about 7 hours.
Downloads took for ever and kept stopping and I would have to start
over.
After reading the online maual and going through the tutorial I
started the game only to find out most of it was different.
Why do they not update the online manual?
And what is the sense of a tutorial if everything is different?
The learning curve on this thing seems hard enough.
I am glad I did not print out the whole manual.
At the price of ink it would have been cheaper to buy the game.
Well I am in the Brell server so if you see a warrior named Merkell
stumbling around like an idiot you will know why.
