I've been happily hunting the single guard spawn in Nektulous
near Lavastorm, several different names, and levels between 14 and 17,
I think (black was as low as they went while I was 14, yellow is as high
as they go now at 15)  Since none of them are red any more I'm
looking for the next step up... unfortunately its hard to tell 18 red from
40 red!

The guards that are exceptionally buffed tend to be the ones near the
entrances to cities in newbie zones; they used to be common prey,
but Verant didn't like that since they were supposed to be a "run
for help" assist for the newbs.  First "fix" Verant bumped their
levels up to 50... but then they could see right thru the invis that
lowbie trolls et al were using to get to the docks or other conveniences..
so they left em with the power and HP of a level 50, but put their
levels back down where they used to be.

Away from those few (usually just a couple near each zone line,
I think) guards seem to be pretty decent prey.  I know at much higher
levels I quite enjoyed hunting Ogguk/Feerot bouncers, for example.
Guards frenzy, of course, but have decent drop loot and are quick
to respawn... plus you get the satisfaction of going after actual enemy
races instead of orcs, treants, aviaks.... sort of the generics of the
fantasy mileu.

15 Druid, did -all- of 14 on the DE guard, leavened by stone
guardians when the guard was an easy one.
