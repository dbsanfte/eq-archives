   I agree that having a faction system in EQ was a good idea, and that
since it has been made moot the game has lost something worthwhile.  But I
think that the way the faction system was implemented was poor.  If faction
is so important, why make the players play guessing games with it?  Why not
have a way for the players to get some information on what factions what
mobs are on besides by whacking one of them?  Some sort of /information
command would have been nice.
