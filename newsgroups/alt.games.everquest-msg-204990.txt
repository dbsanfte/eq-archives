Just to be absolutely clear here, you do not med while fighting.  If you 
are attacking something, you do not get the med benefit.  Same is true if 
you are moving.  If you sit back and watch your warder tank, then you 
will get the med benefit, also if you are casting spells, you get the med 
benefit while casting.  I think you understood that, but wanted to be 
sure.
