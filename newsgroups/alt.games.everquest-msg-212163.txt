Sorry, meant to reply to this comment as well.

I agree here.  Prime example.  Over the weekend, I hyperextended my knee and
damaged some ligaments.  Now, of all of the stuff happening with all of the
people in the whole wide world this weekend, I'm quite sure that the devil
could give a shit that I decided to drag my old butt off the couch for a
game of flag football.  Accidents happen.
