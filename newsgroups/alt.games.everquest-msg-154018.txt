Because monks are the ones who run into a room full of mobs and get hit for
xxx amount with no healers anywhere near?

Because monks are the ones who have to run a mob to the raid camp, thats
hitting them for obscene amounts?

It doesn't?  Monks were implied as a defensive class during the last few
years of Verants "vision"
Take a look at disciplines - 99% are defensive in nature
Take a look at monk class abilities (AA skills)  - again 99% are defensive
in nature

People built their monk around those things, so Id say it changes a LOT of
the time and work invested
