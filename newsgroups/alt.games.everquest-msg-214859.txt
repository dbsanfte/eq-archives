"You should really check this out.  Probably the best MMORPG and its totally
free." (translated into english)

Eight extra letters.  Like typing the word shithead, so little extra effort
its hard to believe anyone capable of operating a computer would notice.

Not that anyone with a brain in their heads is going to click on random web
sites with no better reference than this, but you could at least make the
minimal effort to actually type complete words.

Better still would be to try and describe something, anything, about the game
that you feel beats EQ, since that would make your post at least slightly
relevant to this newsgroup.
