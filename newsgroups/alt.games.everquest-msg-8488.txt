It happens to everyone, and it's just the game's way of letting
you know that strange things are afoot in the Karanas (omens of
upcoming game changes, probably).

It doesn't' actually affect your character, although it's possible
that Tracking and Sense Direction are being played with in the
Karanas, since my group had problems with these when we were
passing through the "plague" zones, even though we certainly
know how to use them properly.
