You are missing the flaw though. The flaw is that they are designing
encounters that can not realisticly be completed by a small group of
friendly people. The game should be designed around no encounter requiring
no more than 18 people of random classes. This means that a perfect group of
half that could do anything.

Right now the bar on some encounters is 48 people of the exact right class
and flawless play(or perhaps 120 casual players) . Since 60 is about the
absolute most people you can have in one area without lagg shutting
everything down this means that these encounters can never be done by the
vast majority of people.

The players form uberguilds specifically to deal with encounters . If there
was no mob that required over 18 people then chances are the biggest guild
would be about 30 ;)
