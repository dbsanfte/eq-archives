I sometimes get nagged to level faster by game/RL friends - good
naturedly, though - because I like to level a few characters at a
time.  I play one, get it up a few levels, than swap to a lower-level
one, do a sort of "catch up" then rinse and repeat.  I enjoy this more
than ram-raiding one character from lvl 1 to lvl X in one, long slog.

Purely my personal preference though  :)
