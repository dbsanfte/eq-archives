Yes, I was concerned that you were trying to trademark something
in the public domain.

As to the discussion you are apparently alluding to, if you wish
to open it back up again I'd be more than happy to oblige you.
I was by no means finished shredding your rather dodgy attempts to
rewrite your comments without ever retracting them.  But I found
your last comment appropriate and let it go.  Still, if you want
to revisit the issue, just say the word friend TwoHead.  Just say
the word, and I assure you that I will oblige with enthusiasm.
