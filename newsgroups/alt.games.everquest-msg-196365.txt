Well I've given my mage a break for the time being and went back to a
warrior (i have 2 now on 2 different servers - Maelin Starpyre -
Istarl lvl 5 & Stromm Istarl lvl 4 (played for 3 or so hrs today).
Thanks everyone for all the help!!! As for the anti-begging policy
when i first got into EQ and noticed that was a skill it astonded me
that ppl would actually beg, now while i don't have much MMORPG gaming
history (or net gaming history at all) I do play D&D 3e on a regular
basis (I DM - always, which is another reason why i got EQ) and as a
DM if any of my players attempted to beg s/he would meet a quick
demise, and yes i do have all the addons (discovered a book of
knowledge today (had help using a ingame mapping system (prolly
obtained from another addon - I bought the Trilogy (ruins of Kunark,
Everquest, Scars of Velious), Planes of Power, Shadows of Luclin &
Legacy of Ykesha (i got a deal :-D ) and promply fell off a tower and
killed myself, haven't bothered to go back there yet. Aside from
seeing new locals is there any preffered place for newbies to lvl
quickly. Im glad to know theres still a hope for me (to get fully
sucked into this game, I've been watching it for years (reading about
it, etc) but haven't had a credit card or $$ till recently (i haven't
seen a gamecard at any of the game stores. I think that the only thing
that could steal me away from this game would be if someone announced
a D&D MMORPG that linked most of the  settings of 2e (Planescape,
Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk) cause that IMO would be cool.

Thanks again for all your help/suggestions EQ is amazingly
overwhelming when u first start playing (total playtime currently
(between all my chars) is about 11hrs
