Thats why I don't have a mac, once upon a time I had a commodore 64, and the
people that made it didn't provide an upgrade path, so when I finally had to
switch systems, I went DOS because thats was an upgradeable system and had the
most software.  AMiga was out, that was made by the idiots that didn't provide
a path up from the C64, and while Mac was a better machine, it had a lot less
software and hardware available.  So I settled for IBM compatible and have been
with the sytem ever since.  A Mac can do anything you like... by running a
windows emulator.  I know its better, heck, Linux is better two.  But just as
Betamax was killed by the inferior VHS, Windows now rules the world if what you
want is the ability to go out and buy games and software thats something other
than an afterthought.

This is why EQ has been so successful, and why I'm afraid EQ 2 is destined to
suck; EQ has had an upgrade path, while you can no longer play the game at all
with the system I had when it was originally released, they've moved the bar
slowly, allowed those with "lesser" systems to keep playing for a while by
turning down the graphics options and so forth, and at the same time kept
making the game bigger and better, moving the engine along.  We aren't still
playing EQ, we are playing EQ 6.2 (thats EQ with 5 expansions and 2 patches
into the expansion)

Moving to EQ 2 would be like moving from the Commondore 64 to a Colt; I'd have
to throw out everything I've done and start all over.
