Normally, I'm all for catering to the least common denominator, but I
draw the line at newsreaders that use the subject line to thread.
The references line is part of the XOVER data sent by the NNTP server,
so the newsreader has access to it efficiently.

Furthermore, for every significant platform that one might view usenet on
(Windows, Mac, Unix), all of the most popular newsreaders thread
correctly.

I'm not saying one should change the subject line for no reason, but if
a change of the subject line better fits the message, whether this will
screw up threading of some obscure broken newsreaders or some
misconfigured newsreaders is not worth worrying about.
