Seeing as how Afghanistan is BEGGING the US not to attack them, I think if
the US says "You have 'this much time' to give him up, or we attack (along
with other NATO forces)" they will give him up.  considering that all of
NATO is backing the US,  puts even more pressure on them to do so.  I for
one hope and pray that it ends without further violence.
