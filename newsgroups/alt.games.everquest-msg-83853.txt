    /cry - Delores was the brunette bearded dwarf. I always thought she had
just the right amount of beard to look dwarven yet cultured, priestly. Rosy
was "the Trickster", a bit of a wild card - and her blonde beard model
seemed a bit more ragged around the edges. And let's face it, they certainly
had "stocky" down. What were you looking for in your dwarven woman?

    With the same variety? Heh, try "at all". There's the one beard, period,
and it doesn't even match Delores's hair colour. She looks like a dirty old
man with boobs now. I know it's low on the priority list, and with good
reason, but I'm still hoping this gets fixed soon.

    I always went for the female models because they were MUCH more distinct
than the male models - I can name pretty much all the old bearded dwarf
women on the server over 50, and some of my other characters (like Cyndi,
the female troll) were likewise unique. The flirting can get pretty annoying
at times. I still tease one poor shaman who tried to get Delores to cyber
with him. (It wouldn't have been so bad for him if he hadn't /shouted "How
come every girl I hit on turns out to be a guy!" instead of /telling me with
that.)
