I've been following the thread on the value of Wizards, and the problems 
caused by their high-end DD spells, Manaburn and the different banes. I 
fully understand that a spell powerful enough to make a difference at 
very-high-end encounters would render lesser encounters totally trivial.

To address this point, I wonder if it would be possible to code the 
damage inflicted by the spell to reflect the current HP of the engaged 
mob. For example, the Wizard could have two kinds of high-end spells: a 
"soften" spell, which could be partially resistable and do up to 10% of a 
mob's current HP if fully unresisted. This, I think, is a *very* sizeable 
amount of damage in some of the high end encounters, and yet this same 
spell wouldn't kill an Orc Pawn. Therefore, there would be no need 
whatsoever to flag the spell *or* the mobs. 

The other kind of useful spell for Wizards could be a Coup de Grace 
spell, this time not partially resistable, but all-or-nothing, and it 
would, if unresisted, kill outright any mob it's cast on, providing it's 
already under 10% of its total health (it would give you an error if 
attempted to cast on a mob higher on health than that). Again, very 
useful in high-end encounters, and not unbalancing in the lower end.

Hm... What do you think? Has my brain temporarily relocated to my rectum, 
or is there some value to this idea?
