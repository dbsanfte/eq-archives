Mph, what's even better...in Finland a person entering from your right has
the right of way even if it isn't a 4-way stop. So if you are driving down
a residential road and another road intersects from your right you have to
yield to them (and no, I'm not talking about when you have a stop sign...I
mean just your average 3-way intersection).  But of course often they'll
have a yield sign. So you spend your time trying to see whether anyone
coming from the right has a yield sign (which may very well be hidden).
Really made me neurotic when I was driving in cities.
