Oh, crazy.. Hmm why do all bard mail quests only raise faction with
antonican bards then? I guess the songweavers look on mail delivery
with disdain?

Hmmm.. this doesn't sound right then...

"Sharing their guildhall are the League of Antonican Bards Mail bards.
Here, the local mail is collected and then carried by mailpouch to
Freeport and Beyond. The Songweavers, unlike the League Bards remain
neutral in the affairs of Faction."

So they are saying the mail bards on are league?  They also seem to be
saying these bards are neutral, which is not true?
