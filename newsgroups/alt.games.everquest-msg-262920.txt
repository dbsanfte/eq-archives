I think the party is well within its rights to ask the enchanter if he has 
the lvl 70 mez, and if not he wont get invite.
Enchanter should warn the party if they dont ask him.

Sounds like a bad cleric.

I gave an example of a 6k hp, 12 aa tank as being inadequate for oow or 
vxed, and surely people would agree with me on that.
Thats a bit different from an ubertank who just needs 1 druid heal against 
RZ. (why misquote me?)
Im just saying a certain minimum level of gear/aa's. If cleric cant keep MT 
up then hes too weak.

To extend my example, your in WOS and ask a LFG warrior for ac/hp/aa....
He replies 1100/6k/12....
You politely tell warrior to find an easier zone. Grats on saving your group 
a ton of anguish.
