One thing to note about snare: none of your snares besides clinging and
engulfing darkness can be overwritten by a ranger, druid, or wizard.
If you snare something, snaring duty on that mob is now yours 'til it
dies.  So if you snare a mob and let someone else kite it, don't forget
to target it after a bit and resnare before the old one drops.  This is
a frustration for other snarers.  One thing I always hated as a ranger
was getting blamed for a mob running away because the SK or Necro
snared it and then let their snare wear off before we killed the mob.
(Sorry group, but I cant put my 14 minute snare on when he has his 1-2
minute snare going and I don't know when his snare wears off.)
