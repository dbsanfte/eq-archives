You can call me uber now :P

I must admit that it took me 6 tries, though.
I was looking forward to solo him ever since I first outdamaged that
monk on him.
Now on my many tries I found that he has just slightly too many hp
for my mana. Maybe hadn't I sold my stein of moggok to a newbie
for cheap - but well, had to deal with it somehow.
Pet is near to useless, considering Slates very high melee damage:
Even with me constantly casting, he wouldn't stay aggroed on me,
and my pet would only survive maybe 10 seconds.
So when I had finally gotten him down to 5 health, and was OOM
once more, just as I was covering the last paces to WFP zone,
I found what I was doing wrong.
Doh! I had given up on fearing coz he would resist that too often,
and I wasn't using my pet at all, and fear would wear off so soon, if not
resisted.
So guess what? My Dots weren't nearly doing their full damage,
and I even then got him down to 5 per cent...

Sheesh, thought it would be easy now, but only after 2 more tries that
didn't go so well, I logged and came back the next day.

Now I pulled a pet, snared and sticked ONLY to dot, root,
dot, dot, reapply root, dot dot, reapply root.... you get the idea...

I was using Call of Bones all the time, and used every pause I could
get for medding, and still I finally ran OOM....
A last Darkness on him, when it broke for the 3rd time, and
then I sicked my pet on him. And it did the trick :)
YAY...

I killed Sergeant Slate - solo!
And I didn't have a single buff, neither on me, nor on the pet...

I know, I could have waited some levels to easily kill him....
But I just felt like doing it while he was still yellow....
