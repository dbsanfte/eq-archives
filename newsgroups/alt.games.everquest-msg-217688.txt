Having a "better' machine doesnt always help.
on a 2.53ghz p4, startup of the 2 screens is a REAL BITCH, and sometimes
zoning can be slow(very much), but as far as switching screens that all runs
fine for me.

I agree that 2 machines would be better. im one decent video card and *any*
functioning monitor away from having a second machine and not having to put
up with this anymore:)
