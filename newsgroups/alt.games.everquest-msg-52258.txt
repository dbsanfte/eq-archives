Ok. That's pretty fucking funny.  But aside from that, yes. I've had
pizza all over the world and the quality can really vary wildly. But
I've had frozen pizza that's completely "acceptable" and fairly tastey.
Will it replace a deep dish garbage can pizza from Chicago? Not on your
life. But it's still "raid food" which is all this topic was about.

Another very popular choice is Hot Pockets. With enough sour cream and
Guac on them, it doesn't even matter which flavor you pick. <g>
