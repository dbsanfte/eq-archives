Yes, clearly this is a progression raid(uber) guild.

A budding or moved Raid(uber) guild wouldn't skimp on preparation for
2-3 expansions down the line, especially as they already know what to
expect from those expansions.

One note, MOST of these guilds will recognize extraordinary
individuals/players, and tend to be willing to exempt such persons from
SOME of the normal recruiting restrictions.  If he truly is grouping
with them "ALL THE TIME" then he should ask them about the requirements
and restrictions.

Most of these groups already have extensive strategies and rosters for
each encounter, and instead of struggling to innovate around different
makeup, as the team makeup largely determines strategies.
"Challenging" Time with fewer than 3 clerics in the raid is radically
different then "Challenging" Time with 8 non-botted clerics.  ditto for
13k war vs 10k Paladin.  The encounter is beatable either way, but the
margins for error and techniques used are sufficiently different that
someone accustomed to doing it one way may find it hard or impossible
to believe that another way is even worth trying.  That being said,
there are some encounters that border on impossible without certain key
classes.  Attempting Xegony with fewer than 4 necros, or Rathe Council
with fewer than 5 CC classes(Bard/Enchanter types)  Certain encounters
are "easier" with a certain team makeup.  Interestingly enough,
unconventional team formations may end up being more efficient, but
simultaneously more difficult to develop an effective strategy for.
"If you only tool is a Cleric then you see every encounter as a CH
chain".
