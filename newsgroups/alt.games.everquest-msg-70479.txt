I've been playing less.

Servers down are one reason, but there are sooo many places to hunt
and things to do its overwelming.  You can see the freeport campers
frantically trying to lose some inventory as the prices plummet. 

The loot in Luclin off the big stuff is insane. shoulder pieces with 6
to all stats, 8 int earrings (with ac), just ultra uber stuff.  And I
thought I was cool when got a Black Iron Medalion for 40pp 2 years ago
haha  Couldn't give that away now.

WIth so many places to hunt, you have to constantly move. back in the
old days would hunt in the same zone for 15 levels. Lower Guk, South
Karana, stay in lake rathe for 8 levels.  Now if stay for more than a
level or two, or even a few sessions, you are doing yoruself a huge
disservice and missing out on other zones that are greening out on
you.. Who would want to stay in overthere from 29 to 45 now?

Anyways, with all the moving around, patches, empty luclin zones and
the like I've just been laying low for a while.  ANd the fact that its
no longer a "cartoon" game and now everyone looks grumpy and uptight,
I may just quit.

got 4 chars over 50 and one 60 so I think I've had my fill. |Next
