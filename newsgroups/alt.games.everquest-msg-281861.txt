After a 28 minute LDON last night we all zoned out except our wizard,
who gated back to the camp.  He tried to get a new mission but it said
we were still resting from the previous one.  We were likely out of
the zone for only 2 minutes at this point, and a few minutes later we
got the next one.  All in all we suspect there to be a 5 minute wait
period from all parties exiting the zone before a new mission will be
given.

Can anyone confirm this?  The other suspect is the amount of time from
the completion of the mission.  Since we zoned out within 30 seconds
we're not sure which it is.  We will likely test it next week but
thought I'd ask in case someone else already knew.

Thanks.
