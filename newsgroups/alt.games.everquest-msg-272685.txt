First of all, diversity doesn't have to apply to every class. Those three 
classes should be the least diverse in the game by a noticeable margin. 
With the exception of the enchanter (arguably, perhaps) they are. A player 
should be able to choose to be the best in some area or much more diverse 
in their talents but not both.

You have the classes that are singular in their purpose and therefore best 
at it and you have the rest of the classes that are utilitarian, blends of 
different roles or both. SoE made a big mistake in relying too heavily on 
the cleric class, but that doesn't mean that the best solution is to make 
sure plenty of other classes have equivalent clerical abilities.

The trouble starts when people start basing their decision regarding which 
class to play too heavily on which one is the most powerful, rather than on 
which one represents their preferred playstyle and invisioned game persona, 
especially when those differences in capabilities between the various 
classes are rarely that great. The only way to prevent that is to ensure 
that each class, whether they are the best at something or not, is fun and 
has enough to offer the player.
