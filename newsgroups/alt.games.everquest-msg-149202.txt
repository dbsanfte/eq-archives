Are there any good quests that a level 51 Ranger can do solo, with only 2-3
hours playing time per day? By good I mean: no huge timesinks involved such
as running a marathon across several zones, or camping a mob for 30 hours,
or running around a zone waiting for a mob to appear on track. By good I
mean: decent exp, or loot. Something that can be sold for a price that would
make the quest worth doing for the time involved. (IE. Could I make more pp
by simply levelling, or trading in the bazaar?) Or an item I could gain from
completing the quest that would beat anything I could buy. IE. would my time
be better spent in the bazaar trading and raising money which involves
almost no effective downtime since I sell when I'm asleep or otherwise afk.
(I could raise the money I need to buy a Wurmslayer in much less time than
it would take to quest for one. I had signifigantly better armor than all of
the twilight quest stuff at around level 44. I was twinked, obviously, but
not because of begging, or being given stuff from a guild, since I have no
guild, or through ninja looting, or by receiving gear from a higher level
player, but simply by buying and selling in the bazaar.)
I understand that some people do quests for the sense of achievement
involved, rather than just looking at the end result, even though that means
mind numbing tedium waiting at a spawn spot. The result of levelling is to
reach level 60, and later to add AA skills, but the journey there should be
enjoyable as well. It should be the same with quests. Are there any quests
you have done that were fun to do while doing them, that either were done
whilst levelling or were so good that you didn't mind taking a break from
the exp grind?
The only quest that interests me is the Ranger epic, but I need a guild for
that, and the time to raid the specific mobs, so I have dicounted that for
the time being.
