Um, no it isn't.  Or at least it wasn't back when I cared about such
things.  You can bind in and under Kelethin, in the tunnel to the CB
zone line, in the canyon to the BBM zone line, and possibly near the
LFay and Felwithe zone lines as well (never tried there).  Binding
another player out in the middle of the forest not near Kelethin gave
the "try a city" message.  It's been probably a couple years tho, so
maybe they changed it to be zonewide, I kinda doubt it tho.
