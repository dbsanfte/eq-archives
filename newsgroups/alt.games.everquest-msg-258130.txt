If your front bumper hits their door it looks to me like you ran into him.
You could say he ran into you, but you should have yielded the right of way.
That is assuming it was a merge and not a lane-change.

Yea, they stopped doing that here 20 years ago.  Anyhow, I think we are
talking about two different things.  In your case it seems more like a
lane-change rather than a merge.  I agree that when a person changes lanes
he is entirely responsible to do so safely and does not have the right of
way.
