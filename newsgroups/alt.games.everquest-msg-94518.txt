You did not KS.   The "policy" can be interpited in different ways BUT, a
spawn is a spawn, you had it camped.   Some guy wanders by, or sits & waits,
get agro, then claims it is BULL.   The spawn was camped & he was attempting
to use a bullshit method of claiming one of the spawns by hanging out &
"accidentally" getting hit.   The "play nice policy" does not mean FFA in
most zones.

He could however ask you to "share" it, & a GM might enforce it.  blah
