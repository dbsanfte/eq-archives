My Necro fits that description, and I defenitely use the med-walking
technique a lot.  I hated the new stand-if-you-move feature.  I like
to hold on to the move forward button at all times and simply click
one button to stand or sit as I need.  Wasn't a really big deal, but
it was just annoying to have to change my habits.  I did find that
using left and right mouse buttons to move forward will not trigger
this option though, so I can go about my old ways.
