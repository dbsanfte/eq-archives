I have found a new exploit in everquest!! YOU TOO CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS
BUG BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!

Heres the way to make it work.. it only works about 1 in 10 tries to keep
trying..

1. In the Kunark city of Cabilis you can enter the pit to battle spiders and
scorpions.
2. Fight one really close to the wall and when it runs it MAY go inside the
wall!
 now heres the fun exploit!!

3. Back away and after a few moments it will return to attack you - but now
IT IS INVISIBLE - and you cant hit it!!

This is the best exploit I have seen in a long time!!

HURRY - try it now before they take the bug out of the system!!!


PS.
Dont email me getting mad that I am giving away a good way to cheat at the
game - we all have to a leg up somehow!

-Kringe
Rogue,  what else.
