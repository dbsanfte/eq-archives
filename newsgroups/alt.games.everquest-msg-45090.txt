It's a good thing to do. If one file system fails, you still have the
others. The more separation there is, the better.

There's also fragmentation to worry about. While EQ may not cause much
trouble here, having multiple partitions will only help.

There are other reasons I can't think of at the moment, but it's a good idea
to keep system files separate from non-system files.
