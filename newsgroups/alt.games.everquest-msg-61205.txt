UO had flawed Pvp from the get go. Recall inevitably favored Pkers as
did the fact that there was no real faction system in place. 
Not familiar too much with AC but EQ is designed for PVE not PVP and
as such sucks ass for pvp.

Uhm why not? How is TFC or Counterstrike different from the High end
DAoC game except that the map is bigger thus allowing real tactics? 
In both games you lose nothing but time for deaths. Yes there are
currently more powerful players then you in DAoC but that is a
function of time and eventually more and more people will be in the
higher levels. Daoc is two games merged. The lower end leveling based
RPG and the high end TFC style game.
