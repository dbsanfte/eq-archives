I just purchased and installed GoD on Wednesday, and it asked to
install DX 9.0, which I did.

I've run dxdiag.exe, which confirms I do indeed have it installed, and
it works.

My question is, is it normal to still see a prompt at or around Server
Selection and just before exiting EQ that reminds you to install
DirectX 9?  Is this something the system is doing in general, or has
my install of DX9 somehow not quite taken?  Just curious if it's a
message SoE is sending everyone or not.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
