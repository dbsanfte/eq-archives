I've never been more nostalgic about any video game more than I am for
EverQuest.  Those early days will never be captured again in any video
game.  The MMOG market has changed too much.

I started up my own account on March 24, 1999 (8 days after launch).
I had played a little on a friend's account while he waited for a new
video card.  The 24th was the day his video card arrived, and the day
I ran out and bought my own copy.

My first character was a High Elf Paladin, who I retired at the ripe
old age of level 6.  I ran into Lesser Faydark with my RL friend (the
one from above) at level 2 to do some exploring.  We high tailed it
out of there with a giant spider on our butt.  I still have the image
of the spider appearing over the top of a hill burned into my memory.
Exciting stuff.

Not long after I spent a good 45 minutes wandering in Butcherblock
completely lost.  I was looking for the boat, which I was excited to
use.  I finally found the ocean, but far north of the docks.  I think
I ended up dying at the hands of a goblin.

The first desirable gear I remember hearing a lot of buzz over was the
Mino Axe.  I spent my entire life savings at level 5 to buy one from
someone... at a whopping 5 plat in my first ever player to player
transaction.  I could practically feel the power of the thing through
the keyboard.

I remember finally crossing that ocean with about a dozen other
people.  We could even see each other.  We chatted and joked and
watched the amazing scenery float by.  At least one person ran to the
front of the boat and /shouted "I'm the king of the world!" It took so
long that relocating to a different continent was a big deal; you made
the new area your home for a while.  Group druid and wizard ports were
still unheard of.

When I joined the only guild I was ever a part of, the officer who
inducted me made a solemn roleplayed speech about responsibilities and
honor.  It was beneath the wizard spires in North Karana, following a
corpse run thanks to a griffawn.  I was a level 12 druid at the time,
and that was one major PITA run from Qeynos to NK.

From this point forward, the most important thing about the game
became hanging out with my newfound friends in the guild.  We did
stuff for fun.  We had our "power" gamers, sure, but the guild struck
an amazing balance between advancement and just general fun.  It was
very friendly towards more casual gamers like myself.  We made an
effort not to get stuck in a rut doing the same thing over and over...
we'd try new areas and above all helped each other out.

I learned to group properly doing the dangerous and often frantic
bandit camps in West Karana.  Bandit sashes were phat lewtz.
Blackburrow also provided valuable grouping experience.

I remember logging on to my account during a short half hour lunch
break to discover that Dyllin Starshine was up in high hold (I had
logged out there).  In my excitement, I started in on him without
properly preparing and barely made it out alive.  But, the Testament
of Vanear was mine!  Of course, what I didn't know was that a
guildmate was on the ramp in East Karana at that very moment, on her
way to camp Starshine.  Oops.  She got it a couple of days later, so I
didn't feel so bad.  The ToV was my longest used piece of equipment,
especially as someone who almost never camped for items or cash.

Other fun memories on the way from 1 to 30: cyclops hunting in
northern Rathe mountains; alligators in Cazic Thule; sunset over South
Karana; crazy trains in Mistmoore; discovering the Lake of Ill Omen xp
explosion; getting schooled in grouping with enchanters in Unrest;
running from East Commonlands Griffins in a panic knowing I was still
bound in freaking Qeynos; thinking I was in on some secret by handing
in gnoll teeth; gawking in awe with about 20 others at the first "full
plate" warrior we had ever seen in the tunnel to Crushbone in Greater
Faydark (I wish I had taken a screenshot of the crowd around him); and
the list just goes on and on.
