Complete BS, don't worry about it.

You can ding 61 with 0 AA points.

There was a short lived rumor that you had to have the Class AA title before
you could buy planar AA.  That was also false.

The only "required" AA is that some planar skills have as prerequisites that
you have maxed out a certain normal AA skill.
