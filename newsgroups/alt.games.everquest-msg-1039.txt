This is incorrect.  Unless they changed it in the last few months, which
I doubt, as they had no reason to.

It casts a short term regeneration spell, that will heal X amount 3
times before it needs renewing.

Twisting healing with another song works just fine, and you can get back
before losing a point.

Test it yourself... open up the character screen, start the song, wait
for it to pulse once, then immediately stop it (or switch to another).
Your hit points will continue to go up for a few seconds after you stop
playing.
