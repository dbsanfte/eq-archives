Oh, this is very interesting
(http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/previews/sep01/luclin.html):

"We're planning the ability to separate your chat channels into
separate windows. For instance, you can have your combat chat in one
separate window, your guild chat in another; these would be
independently sizeable and moveable around your screen, so you can
give emphasis to tells, or whatever."

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
