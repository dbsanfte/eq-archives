Well I do not mean to seem as if I am arguing against your points for 
years and events gone by. You're right. I was not there and have no 
frame of reference for those times and the effects of those things then 
at all. But what I am saying is that at least today in EQ and from what 
I have experienced in the past year, it just does not seem all that 
consquential. Personally, I think a much bigger problem is when you find 
yourself in the 60's grouped with somebody who's bought their account 
from wherever or perhaps inherited one from a friend. Now there you have 
people who are completely incompetent to play thier class and it shows.

And unfortunately, with the current exodus to other games, there will 
probably be more toons like that running around joining hapless groups 
of adventurerers who will soon enough realize they have somebody among 
them who is more of a liability than any help.

I was in an LDoN with one such individual recently and it was crystal 
clear in short order that this person had begun playing an enchanter 
quite recently, although they were somehow level 65. I found it humorous 
myself as the tank instructed him on how to lull mobs for him so he 
could pull. Obviously, there was something wrong with that picture. LOL!

But the funny thing was, the guy learned how to do it and we were fine. 
Although I am quite sure that if we'd had a bad pull we would all have 
been toast. I'm a decent cleric but I am not a miracle worker.
