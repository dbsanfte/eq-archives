I've started on Zebruxoruk(?), at random, with a lvl 9 Beastlord and a 
lvl 3 Bard.  But right now I'm not locked into any server or avatar.  My 
first impression of the Beastlord is positive.  Initially Zebrux' seems 
to be as empty as the KvK servers in AC2. But then I've only been to 3 
Vah Shir zones side by side.

As for PvP, I've never done it and I figured it's hard enough figuring 
out the UI without being paranoid about being ganked from behind. 
Especially with no radar.  And then there's the impression I've created 
in my mind, of PvP that the more arrogant DTers have instilled in me. 
But thanks for the offer.

The biggest challenge for me is the significantly higher need to group 
in EQ.  And the inferred need to be in a decent guild.  I'm not a power 
leveler by any means though I have my moments.  I'm more interested in 
exploring and doing quests just to do them and not necessarily for XP or 
that great item.

I'm also a bit overwhelme by the post count in this group.  48,000+ 
message since January '03.  I'm down to 44,000 unread but half of that 
was killfiling the local looney.  And y'all post faster than I can read. :D

It's alway nice to see a known name in a new place.  Thanks for the welcome.

The Spirit

ps. I already love the shared bank and already hate the inventory space.
