	I don't know how other people live without it.

	Yes.

	Archery is little more than a toy until you get Trushot at 55, at which
point it is marginally useful for staying out of AEs on some raid targets.  It
does not become a serious weapon until you are level 60+ with Archery Mastery
3 and Endless Quiver.

|Finally, how practical is it to solo with a ranger?

	I soloed one to level 48 before the 40% experience penalty was lifted, and
to 51 before we got Panic Animal.  This was something of an accomplishment.
Nowadays, a trained rhesus monkey can solo a Ranger at least into the mid-50s.
