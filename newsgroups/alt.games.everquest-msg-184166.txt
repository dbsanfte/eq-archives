I've been a recipient of a couple of these "senseless acts of kindness" too.
Once my Ogre SK was resting on the docks of Oasis.  A high level character
just out of the blue hands me an Ax of the Iron Back (this was when they
were worth something).   Also another high level character handed me a
Skull-shaped Barbute just for my help in locating his corpse with my spell.

So now I try to keep some loot as charity loot, and give it to characters
who look like they need them.  And I always try to dump a few plat on low
level characters that don't have anything but rusty weapons.  But not too
much plat, it's fun to struggle a bit a low levels :)
