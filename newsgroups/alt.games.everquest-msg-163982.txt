Are we still talking necro fear?  I dunno about later, but I can time
the fear spell's break and cast before he's gotten back to me.  In
fact I prefer to let fear break so I don't have to run halfway across
the zone to loot it ;p - seriously though, I suppose it *might* work
that way in a group - but I don't get aggro unless I'm chain-casting
DD spells, which I don't have a heck of a lot of choice in anyway ;p
Here's how fear for *me* works now, at, admittedly, a much different
level than you, and soloing, no group (but I'd think an entire group
of stuff hitting these things would make it even *less* likely fear
would break fast enough to get me in trouble):

Cast snare on target.
Target starts in my direction (if it didn't stick, well, go get it
pet, while I recast)
Cast fear on target.
Cast two or three dots on target.
Sit to get a bit more aggro for when fear breaks.
Fear breaks, target starts moving toward me.
I wait until he's just about too close, then smack another fear on
him.  He runs again and is dead in 3 seconds.
If fear doesn't stick, or if I'm lazy, I'll stand there and let him
beat on me.  I take about a bubble's damage before the dot kicks him
down too low to fight back, and I've got vampiric embrace on that
sucker anyway.  If it's two bubbles, well, I'll do a lifetap spell
before I throw dots on the next one.
