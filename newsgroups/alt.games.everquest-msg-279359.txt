Yeah. It's happened to me as well. On June 25, 2 Saturdays ago, EQ2 was
fine. On the 26th, I couldn't play for more than 2 minutes without it
locking up, requiring a power-off to fix. Seems to be a Radeon thing,
apparently Sony and ATI might be working on it. There's a few posts about
it in the tech support forums on the EQ2 web site. For me, I upgraded from
the 5.1 drivers to the 5.2 drivers, and now I can play for 2 to 90 minutes
without it locking up. Yippie.

Anyway, you're not alone. Some of the forum posters have suggestions that
may work for you. Good luck.
