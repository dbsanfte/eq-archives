You can come up with a role-playing reason for just about everything.

In this case, your GL sold the skin to a high elf for much more than he
would have sold it to a dark elf.  He "cheated" the bastard high elf.

The definition of "role-playing" is like opinions and assholes...everyone's
got one.  If you don't like your GL's definition, yeah, definitely quit.
