Not entirely true.  Yeah, a badly equipped monk will have a tougher time, but
same said monk with more skill in playing that monk is better than just some
gimp playing a twinked monk.  First thing that comes to mind is pulling a caster
mob.  Why are you going to pull caster, and then remain in line of sight and get
constantly nuked?  Run back to group, run around a corner, force said caster to
come to you.  And you only get nuked once.  There are a lot of little things you
can do to help yourself and your group out.  Even if you are poorly equipped.

My 64 monk is poorly equipped.  But I'm proud of what I've been able to do with
him.  I have only items that I myself looted with that character.  I also don't
raid so I don't have decent raid gear.  I still wear the Thurg Legs, nice clicky
Ox buff, more often than not I am not with a shaman or beastlord.  My haste item
is the belt from Plane of Sky, basically FBSS with stats.  My unbuffed HP about
2500 (depending on the gear, weaps, etc.).  My AC hovering right at or just
below 1k.  I have 5 AAs.  Yes I'm gimp, but I also know how to play him, and all
of my characters smart.  Somehow I was able to be the sole melee (i.e. tank) in
several LDoNs.  And was able to keep agro.  Of course, the casters couldn't just
all out nuke like they could with a warrior/SK/paladin tanking, but we still
cleared and won the crawls in about 40 minutes.  And never had healers go lom.
We did so well, we did 2 more crawls as that group.  And won the other two as
well.  And I pulled all three crawls.

It was kinda fun to be tanking again, but definitely not something I normally
like to do.  I know I can't take the hits.  I also have no problems with the way
monks are today.  I started my monk as my first EQ character 3 years ago.  I
still enjoy him and working him to 65 to start the AAs.
