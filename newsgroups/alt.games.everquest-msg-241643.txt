Everyone got common tongue? When was this? I just re-rolled my character a
few months ago, and he didn't get common tongue...or human tongue, as it's
called on FV. He had to learn it from his brother. The only tongue he
started with was Dwarvish (aye, he be a dwarf) and a little bit of gnomish
(25, have yet to bring that one up yet...). Of course now he's fluent in
human, dragon, froglok, elvish, and dark elvish as well, but that was with
hard work. And while there's not a great deal of roleplaying by everyone,
quite a few of us do roleplay on it and tend to ignore those that don't, and
have a great time doin' so. Check it out again, if it's not to your liking,
you would only have invested enough time to give it a shot. :)
