OK, I like to hunt burning woods too. And since you asked so nicely I
have some LOCs for you.

My favorite spot is up on the wall near the south-western ruins.

-1421, +3203. This spot is where you can sit without fear of being
attacked by mobs, and should never be trained, except intentionally. I
have left my characters logged in there litteraly for hours at some
points.

-1355, +3012. This is the "SAFE" fighting spot. As long as the mobs
don't run you can finght them here with absolutely no adds. Some mobs
path across the bottom of the hill, and some stop at the bottom or on
the other side of the hill to the south, but none are in agro range.
Mobs will tend to run almost directly down the hill, so if no mobs
have stopped there, you can chase them almost to the ruins without too
much problem with adds.

-1348, +2779. This is closer to the ruins and on flat ground. Near a
dead tree. There is a mob (sarnak or wyrm usually) that will path
acros this spot from north to south, and occasionally stop here. You
can usually fight here without adds  except for that one mob, who
tends to stop by about once every 15 to 20 minutes. Watch out for the
occasional mob that will stop INSIDE the tree there.

For soloing, don't pull the sarnaks. They are shamans mostly and all
are sowed. They will run you into trouble if they are not snared.

There are various skeles of different types and levels here. All are
good, don't run. Are not social. You can pull them single easy.

The hornets occasionally path near, they don't run either. Don't seem
to be social, or at least have a very small social agro range.

The zombie apes are good as well, also don't run. They are social
though. If you pull them from the ruins you will likely get two.

Occasionally the giants path near, they do run. They are social.

Watch out for Gullerback. Nasty. Seems immune to magic based spells.
(tried from melee range and still nada) My 48 Warior and 56 Shaman can
take him easy. He's only 48th level or so (even to my war) but the
shammy can't land malo or slow on him. Lands DoT's well enough though.
My tactic has been have warrior keep agro, land DoT's on the ape
(don't even try to slow, though I think my disease based slow might
work, I'll have to try that.) and keep the warrior constantly Stoied
and just land some heals on him when he starts to drop in health.
Guller dropps the Tattered Mantle every time.

The zone is nice for loot. Most mobs drop between 2 and 8 plat, and a
few spell drops as well. (Canni III and Tears of Druzzil x2)
