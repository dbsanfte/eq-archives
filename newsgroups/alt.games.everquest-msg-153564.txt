Which means the mob is up for days potentially, meaning less pops per
month/per year/whatever.

It takes the guild longer to get their needed loots from the mob, so takes
longer before they move up and totally leave the mob alone.

When guilds progress, its usually at the expense of the mobs they farmed...
we used to farm ntov, dain.. now if its the choice of ssra (pharming
keys/ores) or raiding ntov/dain...  ssra wins every time.  Mobs like RC...
90% of the time now we just can't be bothered to go kill him when hes
uncontested

That mean the guilds below us can do these mobs...  then when they move up,
the guilds below them step up.. whats wrong with that?
