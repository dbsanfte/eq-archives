The idea was that Humans were well rounded in stats.  Other races might be
better in some stats, but they are also lower in others.  Humans were also
supposed to get a small XP bonus.

However, two things went wrong.

(1) For most (all?) classes, only one or two stats matter.  The rest are
either "don't care at all" or "as long as you get them above a floor, that
is easy to reach for all races, they are OK".

(2) Humans did not get an XP bonus.  (Halflings did...speculation is that
this was a simple off-by-one error in the code that initializes the XP
tables, that wasn't caught until it was too late).
