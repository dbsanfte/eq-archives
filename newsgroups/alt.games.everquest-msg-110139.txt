Here is my prediction about the death of EQ.....

Over time EQ will lose customers. Whether it is due to the release of
Star Wars Galaxies, EQ2, or any other MMPRPG, enough people will tire
and leave over time to cause its death. We will see the following when
this starts to happen...

1. Fewer updates/changes due to downsizing of the development team.
2. Server Mergers/Closures until only a few remain.
3. Die hard players playing until the day Sony pulls the plug.

I don't expect any of this to happen any time soon. I would be willing
to bet that EQ has at least 2-3 more good years before things decline.
It truly is an incredible game.
