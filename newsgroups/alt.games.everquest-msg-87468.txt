I'd say you definitely want a druid; sow is invaluable, an enchanter
can provide slows that arent as good as a shamans and if you have a group
of four who always want to play together having your *own* transport
is required; people will miss sessions and need porting to join the
others, your usual camp spot will be occupied, etc, and you wont want
to go through the hassle of running halfway across the world or auctioning
for a port every time, especially at the lower levels while you're still
poor and offering 60pp for a port isnt feasible.

For a long time a warrior wont be a requirement; even well post 50 its
not really a requirement for most places.

I'd say...

(thinks)

Druid,
Enchanter,
Tank
Cleric

Enchanter could be subbed for a bard, Cleric for a shaman if your
players are prone to boredom.

Best advice? Choose guys you'll enjoy playing and screw efficiency.

Things people will deem important in a group , though are:

Tankability - someone who can melee (sword close quarters combat) to
keep critters attention away from the fragile spellcasters while they
do their stuff.

Transport - Run speed enhancers for travel and "pulling", letting you
outrun most critters, and get them to where you want to fight and,
of course, get to where you want to be faster. Probably overlaps
your evac and teleport capabilities; some teleports are merely for
transport (on one side of the world, need to pick someone up on the
other or just fancy a change of scene) , others are for emergencies
(deep in a dungeon, surrounded by 400 orcs, need to get out of here
NOW and the exit route is blocked).

Mana regeneration - This will stop you dying of boredom once it begins
to kick in, for an enchanter around level 16, by ensuring your spellcasters
have the juice required.

Healing - Most "priest" classes can provide healing to a degree, but clerics
do it best and for a long time they're the only people who can ressurect
folk after they die, starting at level 39, regaining some of the playtime
lost as a death penalty. Can be dull as a cleric though... sit... regain
mana.... stand... heal... sit....

Crowd control - When you dont *want* to evac from those 400 orcs but would
rather keel them all to teach them a lesson some classes have the ability
to keep them out of combat till you want to deal with them, chopping them
down one by one. Of these techniques the only ones that are really effective
as a combat technique, rather than emergency measures, are those used by
bards and enchanters.

Hope thats some help,

Sui ;)
