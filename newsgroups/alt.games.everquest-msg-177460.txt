Um, yes.  And much as I would love to have that hammer, I don't expect to
see it anytime in the forseeable future, or, for that matter, any of the
other smithing enhancement items that are not player created.

Let's see:

Hammer of the Ironfrost drops off Xerkizh the Creator (Ssraeshza Temple),
+15% smithing
Massive Girdle of the Forge drops off several mobs (Sanctus Seru), +10%
smithing
Gauntlets of Dark Embers drops off Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek (Vex Thal), +5%
smithing
