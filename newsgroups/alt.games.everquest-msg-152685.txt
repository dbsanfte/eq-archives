The exp earned is exactly like that for regular exp, racial penalties and all.
You only get exp for what you normally get exp for, not what you got exp
for at level 51. Light blues are still lower.

The only difference is that all the AA levels are the same 'amount' of exp
as level 51.

A question I hear asked a lot in game is: "Where is the best place to
get aa exp?" Which is a non-sensical question since the answer is:
"Where ever you get exp." It does not matter.
