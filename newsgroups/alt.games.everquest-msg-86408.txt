Wow, where's this coming from?  At level 16 in DAOC I lost 1.5 hours worth
of work AFTER praying at my grave.  In EQ that's an hour's worth max.

At level 40+ I've heard of people CRYING because they've died and GOTTEN
REZZED in DAOC.  Ok, they were probably wimps but it's true that dying 40+
in EQ WITHOUT a rez is a hell of a lot more preferred than dying at 40+ WITH
a rez in DAOC.
