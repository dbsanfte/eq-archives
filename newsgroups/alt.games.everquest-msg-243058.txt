What race and what is your gear?  This is the least worrisome Wis/Class
combo listed, though.  Try shopping the bazaar for Acrylia armor that has
plus Wis stats. Also look for +6 Wis rings (which should be cheap).  You
shoudl also look for focus gear, but with so little info, it's hard to tell.

That means you are at 226 w/o KEI.  Well below the caps.  What is your +mana
gear?  Again, without any info as to what you have, it's hard to say what
you need.

: should this have?

My 40 Cleric is at 201 with relatively available bazaar gear.  He has a Book
of Obulous (sp?) for Imp Heal II and GEBs (+9 Wis).  Both are easy to get
for under 2-3K each.  Imp Heal III gear is harder to get at a reasonable
price, but possible.  Also look for Mana Preservation III or IV gear, but
those will run you several to a couple of hundred K plat for any of them.
