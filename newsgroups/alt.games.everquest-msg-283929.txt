No it isn't.

> Not sure what you mean by ducking

Ducking or typing /stopcast (/stopcasting?) is the only way to stop a
spell immediately.  Note that there is no way to immediately stop a
spell when on a mount.

If you weren't using duck or a hotkey to stop spell casts, you really
should get in the habit of doing it.  There will be times when you
realize the CHeal isnt going to make it and you need to stop the spell
right now and cast a fast heal instead.

It depends on how the spell is interrupted or canceled but you most
certainly save either half or all of the mana when you fail to finish
the spell.
