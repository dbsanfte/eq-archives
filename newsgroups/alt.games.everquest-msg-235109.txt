About my fourth or fifth trip actually, but I have never encountered it
until now.  I preferred to stay away from there even though it is renowned
for good xp, I enjoy taking my time and looking at the scenery of different
zones.
I did have eqlog/yalp running in the background, and three of us reported
the person.
We actually went to PC as one of our guildies was on his alt (who isn't
guilded).
He said that he didn't have a problem sharing if they stayed over the other
side not near us - fair we thought.
Anyway, things went downhill from there and they chose to antagonise him (he
kept pretty calm which fired them up a bit more).
The funniest thing is when he responded, they were like "You're not even
guilded..blah..blah..blah..you can't do anything.."....and his main is one
of the highest in our guild...
Ah well, live and learn - we have just got LDoN so looks like we might play
with that a bit instead.....
