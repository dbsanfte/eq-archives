Three years ago I did this same quest, with the same result.  Soon after I
deleted my human. :p

I don't know what the solution is.  If you hit the Combine button & got a
different looking bag back that you could no longer open, then you did
everything right except you maybe gave it back to the wrong person (perhaps
they said "get this stuff, hit Combine, and give it to my brother").
