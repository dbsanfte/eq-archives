I have one at the Login screen and one at the Server Select screen.  One
so I can skip the server select, seemingly, and the other so I don't
have to hunt through the list and find my server.  They're kind of
redundant and I don't understand why they have both, but they've both
worked for me, so far.

To clarify, I was referring to the "Quick Connect" button where I put in
my station un/pw.  My last used server name is listed below the button
so I know what server I'm going to connect to.
