I've read all the responses in the section of the thread and since
everyone is so curious, I'll respond.  I simply *like* it better. I can
see all the buttons easily, no matter wich character I'm playing, and I'm
more comfortable with it. Also, as I pointed out elsewhere, I'm
colorblind. When I go to fullscreen, half the stuff on the screen is
invisible, and some of the action is blocked out by the stuff floating
over it on the screen. I don't like it and I can't see a lot text, etc.
Simple enough? Different strokes for different folks.

My attack button is remapped to the ` button so I don't accidentally
attack merchants, guards, etc.   I'm a "mouse driver" for this interface.
I prefer being able to zoom the cursor around to click on things, target,
consider, etc. That's what my right hand is doing. What's my left hand
doing?  STEERING!  Yes.... the little arrow keys. I have the muscle memory
down to be able to move around and change the view angle without having to
look at the keyboard. I know some people prefer to use the nuber keys,
etc.  Not me. I do it with the mouse and the arrow keys. So I use an
autoattack, range attack, and special attack hot key, along with others. I
have at least 3 banks of them built for each character. The default is my
combat set of buttons, then I have a "travelling mode" set, and a third
one for auction zones and guild meetings, etc.
