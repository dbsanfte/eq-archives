First, don't purchase, ZoneAlarm is free for personal use and has yet to fail
me, period.

I don't know much about airlans (wireless broadband connections), but as long as
you are getting decent "ping" times (no such thing as lag times), you should be
ok. Your biggest problems will likely revolve around your system specs, if they
are anythign less than the recommended (not the minimum which are a joke), and
how much space you have for virtual memory, hwo fragmented your hard drive is,
etc.

IMNSHO Norton SpeedDisk (part of Symantec Norton System Works 2001) is the best
thing you can buy (short of RAM on a system with insufficient amounts) for
improving your EQ experience, as it does an exemplary job of defragging your HD
*and* sticks your virtual memory file in a contiguous space at the beginning of
your hard drive (you *are* using a fixed size swap file, aren't you?)
