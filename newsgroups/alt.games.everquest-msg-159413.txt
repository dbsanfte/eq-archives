He was an ass about it, but, you are the one who broke the rules.  You
looted someone elses' kill.  According to Sony, there is no such thing as a
camp, first person to engage is the one who gets the mob.  All that being
said, players generally do recognize camps, so, as I said, he was being an
ass, but you still should not have looted.  It is possible that he had shout
and/or ooc turned off too (not extremely likely, but possible).  On the
other hand, he did have ample time to loot it, did you ask him about looting
it, or just run up and loot it once the timer expired?
