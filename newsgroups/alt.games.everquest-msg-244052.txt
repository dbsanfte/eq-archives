  Thanks for the link, Tyas.  I did save it, and might actually use it.

   I have to admit though, I am more interested in simply turning out a
page that works than one that is techincally perfect.  I don't get paid for
this, and I'm not exactly putting up tons of webpages.  I don't like having
obvious errors, of course.  But really, if it works for the majority of
users (and I mean other than just explorer users) then I'm pretty much
happy with it.
