Here is something I don't think anyone noticed or just failed to
mention.
The GM appears to have understood french or at least in part.
He/she suggests that Steelheart name even before he tells he/her that
it means Eagleheart.

The GM seems to have keyed in on the "Eagle" part of the name for
strange reason.  Maybe he/she just got through seeing the old lunar
landing clip and heard that famous line.... "THE EAGLE has landed!!"
 Hehe a good way to test that, if he got that GM again, would be to
say "Yeah, Steelheart is ok" but I want it in french. ;-)

Thats the only thing I can really come up as nutty as it sounds,
because the name Coeurd'Aigle does not appear violate the naming
policy in ANY fashion that I can see.

Hell the name even sounds EQish to me. I really thought that was what
VI wanted in the first place and that was the reason that they created
the naming policy for.
