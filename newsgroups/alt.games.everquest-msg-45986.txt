A Ranger  and Shaman might make a great combo.
You will have the healing and buffs of the Shaman and the
tracking of the Ranger. You could pick a human
or half-elf Ranger and start in Surefall Glade with
a Barbarian Shaman starting in Halas/everfrost area
you would not be that far from each other.

A really great combo I have found to be great is the
Iksar Shaman and Monk. Very versatile and lots of
places to play in Kunark. If you have not played in Kunark
much I recommend it, the old world gets old after a while. =)
