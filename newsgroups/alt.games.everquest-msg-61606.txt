Uh, no.  I was at the event on my server where the storyline
from the 7th journal happened, and he's definitely an Erudite
(Erudian?)

As an aside, the event was actually well-handled as well.  He
asked for helpers, with the obvious result.  So he qualified that
with a requirement that the helpers be fluent in the Combine
language, with a preference for any of the wizard class.  None
were, but there was a ranger, bard, and druid who were.  The
bard was a bit bored and mouthing off, so he told him "Be gone"
and the bard went LD.   A wizard complaining about not being
included got a stream of "you beg more than the youngsters
near banks" insults.   A thinly-veiled threat in response to "let's
see what he drops"-type remarks resulted in a lot of people
leaving;  I guess the "I will instantly destroy any that attack me"
didn't leave a lot of room for the 50+ crowd gathering.  People
who agro'd the skeletons in the city and brought them to the
event to be killed were warned not to do so as well.

At any rate, the event went off with the normal "why don't we
kill him" and "this sux0rs" crowds being able to really interfere.
Add in the language requirement giving people who've done
that a leg-up and I was fairly impressed.   The rewards for
"helping" were fairly low-level, though, for an event taking place
in the Dreadlands.
