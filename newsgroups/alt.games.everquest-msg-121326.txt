Metabolism would be one of the very LAST things I'd get, right down
there with increased lung capacity.

Wisdom is always good. It will allow you more choice in getting gear
that has other stats that you might want, like resistances.

Stamina might be a choice for more hit points, but no idea what kind of a
return you'd get for that investment. Might not be worth it for a cleric.

For the Pally I'd suggest Run3 and Regen3. Regen for melee
characters can not be underestimated, because its constant
regen, sitting, standing, fighting, running. 3 ticks of regen saves
a lot of downtime in the long run.
