Yep, that's our `ghetto evac'. And if things go wrong at least a monk
retains some combat power with no gear while the shaman retains his
spells.

Another question I mean to test is whether a gate in-zone clears agro.
As such binding in the zone, and using gate and FD to clear agro, sounds
like a possible recovery procedure. Want to avoid death cycling though :)

The shaman nuke costs too much mana in any case. Considering the shaman
is performing all spell duties in the party it would be a very rare case
where I have the freedom to nuke freely. But the monks damage output
should generate decent agro while the shaman can take a bit of a beating
before going down.

This is another reason why I suspect the shaman will only be dotting
at the end of combats. Partly so that there's lots of agro on the
monk but also so that if we have a runner he's got a decent DOT on
him.
