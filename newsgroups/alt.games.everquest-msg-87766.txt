This is the one thing I still don't like about using log files
as "proof" of something.  It's the best we have, and I know
it, but I still don't tend to trust 'em.

Situation here...say the offended party was being a
huge asshole back (which you weren't, I'm saying
"what if").  Scroll down to the part of the log you want,
change "If I find you in RL I'm going to kill and eat
your children, cocksucker" to "Please, can't we share
spawns? It's a nicer experience for all today, and
I'm really a friendly person.  Can I give you a Fungi
Tunic for free if we can share?" and<boom> you're
the instant good-guy hero :-).

Like I said, it's the best we have, I guess.
