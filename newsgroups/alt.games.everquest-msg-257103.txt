Yah, I can see a 9th slot being particularly good for bards.  Almost 
insanely good, really.  Hm.  Nerf Bards! :)  But I think for enchanters 
and druids it'd be nice, but not very necessary or critical.  Wizards I 
just don't see the need at all.  Other casters, I can't really say, not 
having toyed around with them at even moderately high levels.

I think the spot I was mainly disagreeing with you, is in what being 'a 
more capable player' means.  In my mind, the most capable player is one 
who can play with the fewest extra training wheels.  So having an extra 
spell slot doesn't make you 'more capable', it just gives you more room to 
be sloppy.  Admittedly, in that sense, level 70 won't make you more 
capable either, although there's good odds that playing long enough to 
earn those extra 5 levels, you might learn a trick or two. :)

Heh, bard on a mount, that would be funny. :) I actually rarely use my 
mount anymore either.  I like it in theory, but actually having to run and 
buy food twice as often gets annoying.  And I just seem to end up not 
needing it.

Well, one time, the cleric asked me to tank, because he had too much mana. 
:)  But I was thinking more of when I'm running across a zone, aggro some 
green or light blue annoyance, and discover I don't have exactly the most 
practical spell memmed.  But I do have slow, so slow the mob, time it, 
swap in root or gate or whatever I missed, and life is golden.  Of course, 
with arcane rune up, I don't even need to slow. :)
