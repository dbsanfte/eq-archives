Yes it does.  And you get it at level one.  I used to keep it
memmed so I didn't have to figure my way out of Kelethin,
I'd get to wherever I was going, then DA and jump off.

I still use it from time to time on the way to raids, where
I'm almost certain to be sitting for more than 15 minutes what
with buffing and all...

But by and large, with a little care there aren't many drops
out there I can't take with a little care and minimal damage
generated.

Oh, you can use DA to drop into the Hole, try that on Safe
Fall or Levitate or the aptly named Dead Man's Float.
