bah... put it on your trader, let someone have a chance to buy it at
reduced rates... sell for more then the vendor will give you, but less
then the rest of the traders.  You will make more plat, and you will
pass some decent items on to those less fortunate.

Ok, if the person was a total newbie, Id agree you wont see the fist
1000 at least till 40.  But lets say a seasoned player who starts
fresh on a different server... I know for a fact they can get to their
first K by around level 22, from farming silks, skins, and various
other trade skill items.
