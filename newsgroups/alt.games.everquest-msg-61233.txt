I upgraded from AOL 6.0 to 7.0, and now when I'm in EQ, I keep getting
disconnected; the two middle #'s go red, and BOOM, I'm disconnected. Also,
whenever I try to loot a corpse, the game freezes up while I'm looting. I can
grab the first item before it freezes; either I get disconnected after about
30-45 seconds or I have to use the /exit command. 

Stinks, doesn't it?
