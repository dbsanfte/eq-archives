So I picked up EQ Platinum today! Finally, maps, Journals, Bazaar, 
updated character models, new races. I can't wait!

On another note, I tried to play a Wizard last night. At what point do 
Wizards become, not easy, but easier to play? I'm only level 3, and I'm 
hoping once I get Meditate that things will get a little easier, but so 
far it is been pretty slow going and a LOT of resting. Does this go 
away? I'm comparing it to playing a Paladin, which is the only other 
class I've played. My Pally has very little downtime and earns XP at a 
decent enough rate.
