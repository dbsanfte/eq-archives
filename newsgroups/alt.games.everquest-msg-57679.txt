Yep. That's pretty much it. And even for the entrance, the respawn time
on that dungeon is the killer. Those mobs respawn on a 18 or 19 minute
timer. If you are only camping the three entry spawns, that's a mob
every six minutes. That's some pretty frustratingly low xp, even for a
soloist.

Now, in comparison, there are exactly the same number of alluring sirens
(around the same level as the greater skellies) that spawn at the twin
peaks in OoT. But they are on a *six* minute timer. Plus, on the one
spawn island, there are three aquagoblins who can pop up as blues (or at
least light blues) until you're fifteen or so. Plus they can drop the
odd nice weapon for your pet. That's six mobs every six minutes, most of
whom give xp. The loot's pretty much crap, but you can stay busy.

They're still blue at 16, but the xp really slows down, and your'e too
low to do the gargoyles yet, so I'm currently looking for someplace else
nearby to do 16 and 17, maybe try the gargs at 18. Since I need to get
my tailoring up for shadowsilk anyway, I'm thinking of going back to W.
Commons and hunting kodiaks. I think they'll take you to 18 nicely. Who
knows.
*sigh*
The old "where to hunt" question never really ends, does it?
