	You need to get out more, then.  Everything you have ever proposed has
been done.  Didn't work then, won't work now.

	It wouldn't have mattered if it was.  Nobody wants to play virtual cop,
even if they LIKE PvP, especially for negative pay.  The "anti-PKs" hunt when
and where it suits them.  They're not going to organize and set up security
for the game.

	Part of the problem is that at the end of the day, you DON'T get a much
more varied game than a first-person shooter.

	None of this is addressing the real issues, which are for the most part
social.
