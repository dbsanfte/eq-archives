No, imposing.  Will she petition me for /whistle'ing at some dark elf who
just got rezzed?  Probably not, but why should I accept her subjective
judgment of how far is too far?  Why should I accept her complaining, and
therefore influencing the also subjective judgment of a guide who then may
forward it to the also subjective judgment of a GM.  Or the guide may just
laugh at such a prude and get on with the important petitions.  All
subjective, as all moral decisions are.
