Ok, thanks Dan... I was just too pre-occupied and agitated with the stupid
thing last night to look into it much, but  will do so this evening. (after
I return from my 12th viewing of LoTR ;) ) AND I was sorta grouped with a
new person (well, he was PLeveling me for about 45 minutes!), so I had
little time to look into the screen, just to notice that the things I used
to be able to do, I couldn't do anymore.

thanks,
Darklet
