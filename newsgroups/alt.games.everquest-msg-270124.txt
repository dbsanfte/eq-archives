Give it time.

For me, HL2, EQ2 and Vampire-Bloodlines all appeared at the same time,
and my initial playing time is split between the three.  However, the
initial thrill of HL2 and Bloodlines has faded a bit, so my EQ2 time
has started to creep back up.  The thing about HL2 is that, although
fun, it's very linear, and has very little replay value (it relies
heavily on scripting, so every game is the same).
