There are many ways of defining "Uberness", some more popular than others.

There's the snarky way: If you have to ask if you're uber, you ain't there 
yet.

There's the elitist definistion: the top five or ten characters in each 
class on each server.

Some people prefer a quantitative definition. It's rather seductive to draw 
up
a list of stats to meet: level 70, so many AA's in certain areas, a certain 
level of
gear (100+ HP per piece or so). In theory, anyone can meet this dfinition, 
given time
and, not so much plat, as the right friends to help you with the fights for 
the gear.

To me, however, uberness is largely a qualitative phenomenon. You're uber 
when
people say you are. There is a degree of relativity here: what's uber to 
someone new
to the game will not impress someone who's been around a long time. Any 
level
70 character will seem uber to a new player, but among the 70's, they have 
their own
criteria.

  Uber is when you can survive battles others can't, can do things others 
can't. The
monk who can solo Trak. The 70 cleric who can melee to death SOMEthing dark
blue to a level 70. The tank who can stand up to a 2000-hitter long enough 
for a
CH to land. The guild that can take down Mata Muram. The guild that can kill 
RZ
with only 35 people.

  Uberness is when people you think of as uber say "You're pretty good..." 
If they're
given to showing that sort of respect at all.
