Great! Thanks for the info. I got into LoIO about 15 minutes before I
was planning to log last night, so I didn't really do much other than
look around a bit. The few gobs that I did see ranged from white to red
(16-20 basically). I figure the only way I'll survive out there, at
least for the next few levels, is to get into a group. I suppose I could
head over to Warsliks as well, but since I am now in LoIO, I might as
well give it a shot. Thanks again!

Brent
