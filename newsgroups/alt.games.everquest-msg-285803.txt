Thanks. I will take a closer look at the sinking sands. I have spent a 
little time there already doing some recce and filling in the map. So I 
guess the way forward is to go through my log and methodically ditch the 
quests that are either too high or don't give enough reward, then start 
getting quests in the sinking sands.

Thanks
