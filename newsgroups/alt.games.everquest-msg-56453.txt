[ancient croc camp]

I did the camp at 36 the first time I played, and for me the most
annoying part wasn't getting the sleeves before the leggings (sold the
sleeves, still wear leggings), but the flee mode pathing. I killed
them with root/dot before snare and root stacked, so if root broke
when the crocodiles were in flee mode, they'd path into the wall
behind them and run off into the water before coming back to the spawn
point. I lost the occasional corpse when a remaining dot killed them
in the wall or water, and the second AC, the one that dropped my
leggings, broke root, pathed into the wall, swam out the sidecanal,
across the main canal and was running towards the froglok areas in the
tunnels when I caught up with him and killed him.
