Of course.  The fact that supercomputers are faster than high-end PCs
targeted at the consumer has never been in question.

Based on my web searches, the fastest Cray supercomputer available
today is the Cray X1 supercomputer.  Each processor in a Cray X1
supercomputer runs at around 12 GFLOPS.

Each processor in your typical high-end PC runs at 4 GFLOPS.  Are the
processors in the Cray X1 supercomputer faster?  Yes.  Is 4x the speed
enough to *emulate* the PC hardware and *emulate* EverQuest and
*emulate* the graphics card so that running EQ on your Cray X1
supercomputer would produce better results than just plain running it
on a high-end PC?  No.

If you doubt me, ask anyone with experience using a Macintosh and
running Windows on it via Virtual PC.  Emulation does not come for
free.  It's very expense.  Or ask anyone using Bochs.

I don't remember seeing you mention teraflops, not that it matters, a
web search will tell you the Cray X1 supercomputer has processors that
run in the gigaflops range, not teraflops range.

My beef with that statement is just that it's so damned obvious.  It's
like saying "your Pentium 4 HT Extreme Edition is faster than the 8088
from 1979".  Well, duh.  Hooray for you that you mentioned it, but
it's completely arbitrary and pointless and does nothing to bolster
your case.

Yes, it was a silly statement, on that we can agree.
