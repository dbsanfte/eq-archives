I have seen exactly two things actually come out of those ldon
chests.

A DE Illusion potion, which was totally useless to anyone
including the person who opened the chest and took the potion
since he was a DE....

and a Gem worth about 2s.

By comparision, my characters have been poisoned, poison gassed,
and cursed repeatedly, not to mention swarmed by little spiders.

If you cant hold your urge to open it until after the addy when
those who want to leave can, you are someone I wouldnt want to
group with anyway so my gating out in the middle when you open a
chest wont cause me to shed one tear for you.
