It does wear off eventually.

Personally, I never ask anyone if they have KEI, and I don't pay attention 
to people who advertise XXX with KEI.  If they have KEI, fine, if not, no 
big deal.  I never get KEI for my lowbies, well, except when I want to 
enchant stacks of something with my enchanter, it speeds that up so much as 
to be worthwhile.  My 61 shaman, will grab a KEI when it's convenient, when 
not, no big deal, just fight without it.
