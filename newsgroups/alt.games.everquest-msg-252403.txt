He should have been in it less.  Carl (his character) was killed when the
bugs smashed the labs on Pluto.

> Dina Meyer, thankfully, is.

She should have been in it less.  Dizzy (her character) was male (and died
early without kissing Johnny), and Carmen (the love interest in the book)
signed up as a naval pilot.



The reason for the bad reviews was because of how bad the movie was;
specifically how *unfaithful* to the book it was.

One person put it best when he said "How can they have gotten so much of the
book into the movie, and got it so wrong?".

Cases in point:

The M.I. takes care of it's own, book:

Breckenridge dies during training in the Canadian Rockies.  They spend
several days sweeping the mountains until they find his corpse.
When Dillinger deserted then commited kidnapping and murder, they took him
back, even though they really didn't want him, tried him, and executed him.
They didn't leave it for the civil authorities to clean up.
When Dizzy Flores was injured on a drop, they went back and got him, even
though they took a chance on being left behind, or of not being able to
rendezvous with their ship.  He died on the way back, but for the M.I.
that's no reason to leave him behind.

The M.I. takes care of it's own, movie:

One of the men got grabbed by a bug and hauled away.  Sgt. Zim shot the man.


Join the M.I., book:

The military does everything it can to convince you *not* to join.  They
only want the most determined people.  They'd rather have nobody than have
conscript troops.  This theme is reiterated all through the book.

Join the M.I., movie:

Posters everywhere to join up, defend, et cetera ad nauseum.  The exact
opposite of the book.


Hendrick and the knife, book:

Hendrick wants to know why bother learning knife fighting when someone can
push a button and blow up a city.  Zim points out that you don't always have
the button, and that it's indiscriminate; you can't deliver a lesson, only a
mass death.  Basically, that there's scales of action for different
purposes.

Hendrick and the knife, movie:

Zim nails Hendrick's hand to the post.


In the book, the M.I. is exclusively male and it's explained exactly why -
no matter what some fem-libbers might want to believe, men are, by and
large, bigger and stronger.

In the movie, it's full coed so they can have the naked shower scenes.

In the book, better than 90% of naval (space) pilots are female, and it's
explained exactly why - faster reflexes, better resistance to G-forces,
voices that carry better under combat conditions.

In the movie, no idea, because I didn't see it.

In the book, powered armour, heavy-duty stuff that allows them to move
faster, farther, with more.  At one point it describes Johnny Rico as
carrying at least 200 pounds of ordnance that he still had to use up,
including a pocket nuke; obviously therefore he'd started with even more
than 200 pounds of ammo.

In the movie, they were unarmoured.  One person pointed out that the armour
in the movie was inferior to that worn by L.A. SWAT teams now.  The
explanation was that they couldn't make 800 suits of armour for the movie.
Well, if they could CGI 10,000 bugs, why in heck couldn't they CGI 800 suits
of armour?  And the argument that people wouldn't see their faces was junk;
The Abyss came out years ago and solved that problem.

In the book, the bugs were fast, nasty, and smart.  The bugs had spacecraft,
including starships, orbital fighters, and all the miscellany of a high-tech
civilization.

In the movie, the bugs were... bugs.  Specialized bugs for various purposes,
but about as bright as a cockroach.  Sure, the tanker bugs and the
plasma-howitzer bugs were visually impressive, but they weren't even
approximately true to the book.  The idea that the bugs would fire a shot
from the ground and expect it to hit Earth dozens, if not hundreds, of
light-years away was absolute garbage.  Especially when the shot's going to
take umpteen millions of years to cross the distance.

In the book, the bug swarm attack was a huge mass of workers, absolutely
incapable of fighting, swarming over the M.I., hiding the fact that in
amongst them were (about 1 in 20) warrior bugs, armed with plasma rifles.
Note, not armed with claws and mandibles, but armed with real guns that
could shoot people dead.

In the movie, it was a swarm of mindless bugs that simply rolled over the
opposition, clawing and chewing.


As a movie about some marines fighting some aliens, it was so-so.  (Aliens
was far better.)  If it'd been named "Colonial Marines" and had all the
names changed, it'd be (barely) worth picking up in the sales bin.  People
would point to it and say it ripped off Heinlein, but it would have
basically been ignored.

As a movie specifically touted as being *Heinlein's* Starship Troopers, it
was absolute garbage.
