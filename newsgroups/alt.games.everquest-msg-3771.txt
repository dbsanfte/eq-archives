Uh...You do realize that you need at least two people to do that quest in a
short time...
One to camp and kill and one to constantly keep asking the NPC in Surefall
the same inane question to jump start the spawn. If you do it this way you
can usually get the cask to drop in about an hour. Mi amigo and I do this
when we need plat and we sell the cask for 100 plat to all the other
frustrated solo campers. Minimum 50 plat apiece for an hour or so work ain't
too bad in those parts.
Don't forget to grab the silver ring at the bottom of the razorgill pool and
go sell it to a WIS based player for a few gold or a plat. Barbarian Shamans
like anything that raises WIS even if it is only +1.
