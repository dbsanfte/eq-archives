... Allright... enlighten me. What else is there? You learn the
strats, work together, mob/event either goes down or not.. loot gets
distributed via whatever system has been setup. Rewash. The more
things you can kill, the better you are considered in game. That's why
guilds are referred to as Time-level(or Quarm level)... elemental
level... etc. Gear and the accumulation of it by the guild is just a
process to enable you to kill bigger things, and thereby advance, and
at the level we're talking about, its almost all no drop and
non-buyable. Score is kept by whether Quarm hit the freaking floor or
not, not what you happened to be wearing when you did it.

The uber guild PL'ing some shit for brains 0AA level 65? Sorry, not
something that is done. The members are too busy AA'ing themselves in
their offtime to PL someone, and generally they can hold out for an
app with real AA. You can get xp groups sure but its not something
easily fixed. Its feasible you can pay someone to PL you AA, i've seen
some players willing to do that, but you still get away from the
experience needed to be accepted.

>At that stage an AA as much a commodity as the gear.

It is possible to pay for someone to PL you AA.. i've seen services
that do that, but at the same time you get farther away from the
experience needed

Guild requirements tend to also be a filter for new and inexperienced
players.

And likely to know what he's doing unless PA'd. And if PA'd usually
doesn't make it through or even into the app process.

True.. but at the same time if you don't meet the req's, along with
having some people to back you, you aren't allowed to do either.

Excepting cleric and bard, they don't usually require epic to be done,
For the other classes, they just need to be aware that they can NEVER,
EVER ask for an epic raid.

True.. but with the exception of some epic raids, like VSR where the
spawn gets taken down fast ghetto guilds don't have to compete over
spawns. It isn't until you start to hit targets with pretty serious
gear that you start dealing with it. Heck, it isn't uncommon to have
unfettered access to full spawns for NToV or WToV until the one or
two-groupers go after them for alts.

You do need to be able to establish a history and make friends though.

There are a lot of people who have a hard time, if at all, dealing
with the buttkissing, bullshit, and politics that goes along with said
uberguild.

Advancement in everquest is more a matter of learning the strats and
getting people to work together to do things properly than gear per
say. Uber guilds are better equipped because they will bang their head
against the wall until it breaks. Learning something like RZTW usually
takes 6-7 failures as you get farther and farther in the event until
you finally succeed and can subsequently farm it. After all, these
days a good leader can cull an open raid of 50-60 level 60+ in..
whatever... and take anything short of RZTW.

Some of the events have some pretty hefty requirements. Like the Rathe
Council

Or one-grouping Tormax, etc.

True.

By spending the 200K you get reasonable starter equipment and access
to the guilds that can get you both a history and a rep to get to the
endgame. If you get there, is up to the player.

Did I say they had to pass the Turing test? I did not. I said they had
to fool Sony. HUGE difference.

Even if GM's are going to try to ask random players stupid stuff to
see if they are 'bots', the routing of the tells and responses to them
from a couple real-life humans would be weaksauce to implement.
Complete with queueing two to three responses before sending them out
to give simultaneous responses. A test of this magnitude from a GM is
only going to last a minute or two and a reasonably fast human
response to a random GM question usually suffices. At the same time,
you usually wouldn't even have to go to that level because any
disputes are handled directly between the raid leader and the GM with
no other members of the raid involved. Once you delve into the
third-party program arena you can build yourself a custom interface
that allows for the control and manipulation of multiple players with
built in scripts for performing raid functions that are triggered at
certain points in the event through either the enviornment or a raid
level command protocol.

Seriously, you really think this is that hard? If a warrior calls out
a tanking nomenclature I AM NOW TANKING <%T>, PLEASE ASSIST, its
really out of the question for say a rogue program to filter on that,
/assist, and then determine where to stand so that they can hit the
back of the mob is, and then attack while routinely updating in case
the mob moves? PLEASE BREAK DOWN <%T> from another leader and you get
the bot shamans, mages, etc breaking down and slowing, crippling, and
whatever to the mob? PLEASE DUMP THE CLERICS to the necros? You give
way too much credit for how much human brain power is actually needed
to run a raid. Even your typical CH chain isn't that hard to automate,
and probably would run a lot better.

More like 5-10 until the item they want drops. And it wouldn't be that
hard to seperate the customer from the raid. Get the access
information, bot them on a raid to loot the drop, have them change
access info once transaction complete. If using an automated guild
though, it would be a lot safer security wise to just outfit and build
players and then PA after equipped.
