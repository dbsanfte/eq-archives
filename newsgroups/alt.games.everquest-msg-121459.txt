I third the bleh!

It seems like they made that town difficult to navigate on purpose.  They hide a lot of the
zone boundaries behind buildings.

My main grew up in Kelethin,  and as confusing as it is, I much prefer it to Qeynos, but
maybe that's because I endured the pain of learning how Kelethin is layed out.

I wonder why the beginning cities are so much harder to navigate than the higher
level cities such as Thurgadin.  You'd think they'd want to give newbies a gentler
introduction to the game, instead of "WTF?  I'm lost AGAIN.  sigh.  Where's that
map?  /loc    spin... wander around for a landmark...damnit crossed a zone line."

I vote that Qeynos be torn down and remodeled.
