I've read of quests that 'switch off' like this on allakhazam.  I've tried 
some of them at higher levels than listed, and had them succeed.  I think 
it's probably a rumor caused by someone with faction issues they didn't 
know about.  But I won't swear to it, and I haven't tried the wooly fungus 
quest specifically.  Maybe, if I get bored enough, I'll try it. :)
