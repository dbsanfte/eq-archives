No, whats shit is the fact that its thrust in our faces and its not a
game Id buy, while I might for a breif moment have considered paying
the money to buy it for EQ2 beta, I cant get that coz I dont live in
the US. So, the whole thing is shit, sorry I reffered to use as a "US
citizen" I dont live there, it makes no difference how you word it,
either way, Im not anyway located in america like many of the other EQ
players.. And, I dont want this stupid offer thrown in my face as if
Im being rude by not accepting it when the only bit of it which
applies to me is the 30 days eq time and a game I dont want.
