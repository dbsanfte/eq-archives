All the high lvls go there to have a non threatening easy exp grind, exp
grind for AA exp is particularly good.

I think the reason that you don't get mid 40's peeps in there is because of
the overcrowding and the likelihood of getting a pickup group if you are a
mid 40's char is slim.

Would be good for a mid to late 40's group of friends to go there to fight.
