Cheapest one is the Spyglass, a relatively simple player made
tinker item, retails for 15pp or so on Morell Thule.  Click
to get telescope effect, which is a "close up" vision buff which
lasts about 15 seconds, not terribly useful.. but the fact that you
can get a buff up without slowing down your melee or spell
casting, and fast enough to replace a buff thats been dispelled,
is invaluable.  I just helped a fellow cleric out on a Ragefire
kill, and I lost exactly two buffs despite being hit repeatedly
by his dispelling AOE.  I lost my TBoots buff, which was in
the first slot, and I lost Endure Poison, because he managed
to stick Dragon Roar to me in the first slot so my Spyglass
went to last slot while he dispelled.. one of my trash buffs.
At any rate, I clicked off spyglass and got it into that second
slot, and after that it was the only buff being dispelled.  My
druid friend with no insta click lost about 10 buffs, including
all her "dummy" buffs, plus her circle of seasons, KEI,
Symbol... I think the only worthwhile buff she had still up
was POTC.
