Hell Jak, at your level with a couple of friends you really shouldn't have
much trouble taking down a hunter & forager...AND they're good xp as well.
In fact, a couple weeks ago a few friends and I were hunting them strictly
for xp and /ooc'ing any time we got yet another medallion in case anyone in
the zone needed one.

A full group of 44+ shouldn't have a problem if they know their roles.  A
partial (let's say 4) group at 47+ shouldn't have much trouble.  I have a 54
enc and 52 dru that I play together when I want to solo...I would have a LOT
of trouble with them unless I resorted to snare/root/dot or fear kiting (not
generally a good idea there, due to adds).
