Thats not true.

Yes, the AE can hit you, but it doesn't put you on the agro list.

It's real easy to test - next time a guild kills wuoshi, stand in range of
the fight, when his ae hits you (stun or fear) con him, he will still con
ally/amiable/dubious whatever  (a nonkos mob that you hit kons as
threatening, a kos mob is obviously scowl)
