I got this yesterday for my SK. It was really cheap fer the stats even
if there is a recommended level. Here is the data on it...

Planar Lance of Torment

LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  
Weight: 10.0 Size: GIANT 
Slot: PRIMARY  
Damage: 30 Delay: 32 
Ratio: 1.066 Amazing
Damage Bonus: 37 (lvl 65) 
Comparative Efficiency: 151
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Dex: +10 Int: +10 Poison Resist: +15 HP: +65 Mana: +40  
Weapon Skill: Two Hand Piercing 
Classes: Ranger Paladin Shadowknight Warrior  
Races: All Races  

I got it mostly because if looks sweet and my DE Sk will be picking up
all the little DE ladies with this equiped ;). Anyways, here is my
question.

I know that pally and sk's should shoot fer a delay of around 40 for
the damage improvements however, what would the difference really be?
My SK is not of level to see the difference. I was thinking that
tonight I will equip it on my warrior to see if there is a big
difference between the bonus on his wormy to the lance. If anyone
knows how this is calculated please post data so I can see if this
weapon is truely crap or not. (Personally, for the delay and stuff for
now, my SK will be happy with it, at least till I can get him a wind
lance.)
