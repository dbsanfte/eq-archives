With all the problems MT has been having this week (certain zones
coming down like clockwork and general server crashes), I had to make
the same 7 stacks of arrows 3 times before we made the transfer.

Make the arrows and finish them and zone crashes before my character
is saved.

Come back up, remake the arrows, zone crashes before I am saved again.
DOH!!!
