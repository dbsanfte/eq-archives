   So then the first entry usage is the only
one that is proper?  I disagree.

   You're correct that I didn't look the word before
I used it.  I don't look up _most_ of the words I 
use because I am fairly confident of my usage of
modern American English.  Oh sure, sometimes I wiff
it.  But I do have a paper dictionary on my desk, 
and I'm not afraid to use it (is it ok with you that
its a printed version and not an online one?).
  Now that I think on it, I doubt that I've looked
up less than %2 of the words I've ever used.  
How many of the words you use, Ken, have you
really looked up?  Or are we just assuming that
I should look all words over two syllables 
because of my obviously inferior education?
   I used the word "celibacy" correctly.
