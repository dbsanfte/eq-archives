There's your problem. Your 'account' resides on Verant's servers. It
doesn't know you're the owner, that it was installed on that PC, or
anything else such as what's installed on that PC

The ONLY 'contact' you have with your account is when you log in. At
that point you tell VI what account you want to play. When you entered
the 30day account key, you used a 'name' and 'password' to register,
right? That name/password allows you access to the 30day account. The
30day account only has the basic lands. You could install all the
expansions you like, but until you enter the upgrade codes, you won't be
able to play on them on that account.

As for your old characters, chances are, they're still there.

How does EQ know what account (and hence, characters) you want to play?
It doesn't care what you look like, what your fingerprints are, what
geographical location you're playing from, which PC you're sitting at.
The *ONLY* way you have of telling EQ which account (chars) you want to
play, is by logging in to that account.

To find your old characters, you need to login using your original
name/password from when you last played. Then you'll probably find your
characters sitting where you left them, as well as all expansions active
when you left on that account.

If you don't remember your old name/pass, go to the EQ website, and use
their tools there to get a new one.

I have an account with L60 warrior, load of mules, and
kunark/velious/luclin installed. If I logged in under the 30day account
login/pass I would have no chars, and no access to the expansions,
despite the fact they're all sitting on my PC. I could then put in my
regular login/pass again, and be able to play as usual, with no change
to what files are on my PC.
