Depending on what im farming, if its really easy stuff, usually one or two
bow shots while running towards em kills em, track next, kill that.

For stuff with a bit more hp, put on full DS (full self only is 48), gather
mobs, then melee them down. (ie shak datho in shadeweavers).

For place's like acrylia caverns, root + headshot and a fast bow work nice
here (healers etc can be a pain for some, headshot means it doesnt matter if
they heal).

Druids make good farmers with a charmed pet also (DC).
