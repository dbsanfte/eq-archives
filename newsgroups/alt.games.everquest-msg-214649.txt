Hmm, nope. Shaman > Drumman.

Shaman are about regening the HP, then trading for mana.  Having a huge mana
pool isnt a priority, as you can gain it back so quick.

Eventually you will get spells like stoicism, and torpor, which are heal
over time with detremental effects (slow movement and attack speed).  But
they have a low mana cost, allowing you to cannabalise yourself down, the
stoicism / torpor yourself back up, with a substantial mana gain.

Hit points are the most important stat for a shaman, with ac second, stamina
third, and wisdom last in my opinion.

Another reason to have high hit points is due to the nature of your job, you
WILL get aggro, and if you are a drumman, you will get splatted very
quickly, a true shaman, however, can take a hit or two should they get a bad
run of resists.

Root rot is one option (for a drumman), but I prefer to tank with my shaman,
allowing the pet to do damage, while the slowed / poisend / diseased mob
tries its best to kill me (usually without success).

I guess both the shaman and drumman are valid styles, but I would never,
ever, play or equip my shaman like a druid, ever.

To the OP, my shaman is a barbarian, I dont really care about perfect race
stats etc, or even regen as these can be acquired by other means.  My and my
brother both started barb's, him a warrior and me a shaman, no other reason
than because we wanted to.  Choose the one you want to be dont worry about
'perfect race for class' the differences are so small and easily other come
its better to play a race you actually want to be than one simply because it
is the 'optimal' race for a shaman.

That said, I would say either Troll or Ogre (troll for its regen and nice st
a, and ogre for its very nice sta).
