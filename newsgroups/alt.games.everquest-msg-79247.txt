Hopefully you'll get to feeling better soon. Not an ill-considered comment
at all. I probably -shouldn't- be there. Usually I am fine unless I get 3 of
something attacking me, then it's run/gate/zone whatever works.Well, your
comment to the Dark Type would have made a better curse, I admit. Perhaps
I'll stick it on a hotkey and use that instead. I've never done that before,
and I will NEVER do it again. Lesson learned.

thanks
