Well said. Don't let the experience sour you on raiding entirely. My 
earliest Vox and Naggy raids back in the day were simply nightmares. 
(And back then, the amount of twinkable gear available for the best 
equipped 52's wasn't so hot, and they were tougher kills.) But once you 
move up to larger targets in a guild environment, that can all change.

I too can remember sitting around for, literally, five hours while 
people tried to get a Naggy raid going. Then taking two more hours just 
cleaning up the mess.

Later on, my guild was taking down Velious dragons with less than twenty 
minutes elapsed from the time the spotter first found the dragon up and 
when we started calling the loot.

A well run raid with an experienced team who know what they are doing, 
work together well, and are being led by a seasoned, capable raid leader 
is really a marvelous thing to behold compared to a pickup raid.

Pickup raids are the devil.
