   Yeah, but lots of caster classes might have issues with
"idiot melee'ers" who think that buffs, heals, ports, and
rezzes are owed to them on demand.  I know I was certainly
thinking the word "jerk" about the level 14 warrior who was
following my ranger around the warrens while she was trying
to do faction work.  He just kept saying "Heal me?". 
Rangers are crappy healers, and I wasn't there to PL a
stranger.  It got annoying real fast.  Any other other
classing characters, I bet, can tell similar stories about
these three classes.

Annie <--- Pretty sure he thought I was jerk, too, for what
it's worth.
