Aloha Cory,
    Mahalo...I just installed my 8500 ATI card and discovered the gray 
out problem. My "old "7200 had a problem with the text running off the 
'hot buttons' and outside the dialogue box with long sentences. The 8500 
ended those problems but you can imagine how bummed out I was having the 
a worse problem while spending over two hundred dollars on the new 
board. After trying the cycling F10 solution I could see fine. Thanks 
again Cory for mentioning it, and you too Jeff for letting me hitchhike 
on this post - redakamia, Tov. Server
