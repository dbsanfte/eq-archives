You CAN just go kill the various owlbears in Paludual Caverns too.  I
just got my perfect pelt not 15 minutes ago and, as we speak, my
ranger is making his way across Mons Letalis on his way to Katta to
turn in the damned bag.  Soon, soon I shall have my Rallic pack......

Anyway, I killed Goldeneye and the two owlbears that pop in the
deadend not far from there for less than an hour before I got my
pefect pelt.  I'm sure it's easier if you're doing this late at night
though....
