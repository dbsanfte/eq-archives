I believe this is a video driver issue and I have see this effect from
drivers 2.1.8.3 and the Windows XP supplied nvidia driver. The main problem
is that I cant suggest a better driver although the EQ site may have one. XP
would not let me install it - the 22.80 that tech support recommends. It can
be reset by changing video modes. I have noticed now a drastic difference in
how video drivers affect game play. Good luck.
