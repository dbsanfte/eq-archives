I rarely cast all my buffs on myself, and I don't have an elaborate
system of timers, so I ask that the others let me know when chloro/SLD
drops. Some tanks tell me, I've had some even tell me when
damageshield has dropped, but then there's the ones who even forget to
tell me to refresh chloroplast. Last night, after repeatedly having to
ask three tanks if chloro had dropped, I started using pack regen
instead. (No, I don't see why I should keep my eyes glued to the clock
when all they need to do is tell me when the blue hand icon starts
blinking...)
