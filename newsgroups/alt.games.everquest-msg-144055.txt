Most epics are startable in the 20's or even lower. That's part of the term
"epic" is that there is a series of events that tell the larger tail.

For example, the first piece of the bard epic requires no battles at all.
Take a druid along with you, and you could easily do this one in about a
half hour. I did it by myself over two evenings in about 1 hour of play
time - possibly just over - when I was about 23 or 24. Phase two of the bard
epic is also pretty simple. The real catch in it is getting to Marfin in the
back of Sol A, but, with a full group, is certainly doable in your mid to
late 20's. It is not until the last part of the 2nd phase of the epic that
things become more rough. You need a full group in their 40's or so to do
this one. In the remaining phases, you need to kill a named cyclops (doable
in your 30's), some named drakes (well into your 40's), and then both a red
and a white dragon (usually Naggy and Vox, but there are others available).
These are what ensure's that you're not getting the SSS until you hit 50 or
so (it won't proc until 50 anyway).

As to whether it's a waste of time. Tough question. There are most
definitely some better damage/stats weapons than the SSS. On the other hand,
it gives your songs effect as if you were playing an instrument
(unfortunately, only a store bought) even when wielding the weopon - this
means now switching away from the weapon to deal with song requirements,
which is a pretty large benefit if you ask me.
