I am one of the many who is pulling my hair out after the "upgrade" to 
DX9. I have an NVidia <snip model and pc details...>

My problem is <snip problem>.

I have tried all the recommended Sony snake oil fixes.  To include
installing new drivers.  I then uninstalled them because they were no 
good and went back to old.

Anyway anyone else having this and if so do you know of any fixes??
