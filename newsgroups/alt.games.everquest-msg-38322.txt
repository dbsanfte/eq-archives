refresh rate

it defaults at 60hz in win2k, there are "fixes" out there but they don't
quite work right,

my main monitor is diamond pro 2020u, it can handle it<G>, but the
problem shows on my other systems too so I know its not just that
monitor.

I can get games to run at 85hz where I like it but there are still
problems with some games with menus and such, monitor switching where
there shouldn't be and I suspect this is harder on the monitor not to
mention irratating(EQ is not one of these BTW, I use "screen same
resolution").  So its not a question of it being limited, its a question
of it working properly.

OTOH some folks may be happy with 60hz so no problem for them, many may
not even notice till unless they check their monitor status in game. 
60hz looks crappy to me.

I've been running Win2k/Win9x dual boot since Win2k came out, benchmarks
are starting to get more better with win2k but my experience is that
WinMe(with system restore turned off) is still better for gaming, the
monitor problem just being the most noticable glitch for me.  Other
things are more subjective, games running smoother in high load
situations, etc.
