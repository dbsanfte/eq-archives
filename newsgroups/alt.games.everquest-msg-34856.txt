Hail and well met,

My wife and I now have two computers and two EQ accounts, so now we can play
as a team. We would like to start out new lowbies of the same race.  So,
we'd like to solicit opinions as to what race/class combinations work well
for a duo.

Just a few caveats:

We play a druid (38th) and cleric (48th) as our current primaries and we are
not looking for either of those two classes as our new characters, so a
logical choice of  the cleric/warrior duo is not an option. We do think that
we will need some healing capacity which means either a shaman or a bard as
one of the classes (we
don't believe that a paladin will be able to handle the healing burden of
two characters).

Here are our options as we see them:

1).  Troll warrior/shadowknight and shaman
2).  Ogre warrior/shadowknight and shaman
3).  Barbarian warrior/rogue and shaman (shaman night vision early on)
4).  Iksar warrior/SK/monk/necro and shaman
5).  Wood elf ranger/warrior and bard
6).  Half elf warrior/paladin/rogue and bard

There might be another class/race combination that I am missing.  Anyway,
I'd like to ask the readers of this newsgroup if they have an experience
with this type of tandem.  We're looking for a duo is fun to play but also
can work well as a team.  My wife is not overly fond of the troll and ogre
women, so we are slanted towards options # 3-6.

Many thanks in advance,

Rick
