Several.   All of them are pretty equally useless.   Either they don't do
enough, or have atrocious recharge times.  (or both)

Level 53, Charge.   All hits land for 10 seconds - Recharge time 30 mins.
(60 percent of your hits would have landed in any event.  So really very
little extra damage.)  Not worth waiting the half hour.

Level 54, Mightystrike.   All hits are critical hits for 10 seconds. -
Recharge time 1 hour.   Flashy and fun, but the actual increase in damage
isn't that big, and an hour is a long time.

Level 57, Precise.  Hits land "more frequently" for 3 minutes.
Disadvantage, any swing at you has a greater chance of hitting you  -
Recharge time 30 mins.  Helps sometimes, but I'm not sure exactly how much
"more often" your hits actually land.   Doesn't seem that much when I use
it.

Level 58 or 59 (I forget) Fellstrike - Raises base damage on your weapon for
10 seconds.   All hits land harder.   - Recharge time 30 mins.

Level 60, Agressive.  -  All hits do extra damage for 3 minutes. (not nearly
as much as Fellstrike)  Disadvantage - All hits that land on you do extra
damage. - Recharge time 30 minutes.

The best thing you can contribute is having defensive ready and available
should the unfortunate happen.

I can't imagine a situation in which I would be absolutely certain that I
wouldn't need any disicpline at all for 2 hours.   So I would never use it.
I never use mightystrike on a raid either, although some great idiots do.
