I don't know. Are they right?

You might want to read from where I jumped into
the thread, and get some background.

Dennis said "that the US is not an empire", and I
asked him why he thought that. 

Whether America is/was an empire or not, was of
little interest to me until then.

I did, however point out that when you type into
Google "American Imperialism", you do get a lot of
hits. A lot of those sites are from colleges with
resources studying the history of American
Imperialism. If it doesn't exist, I'd like to know
why.

I don't mind taking up a contrary view for the
purpose of dialectic, though its not something I
feel strongly about.

Here you go... this extract comes from;
http://www.chuckiii.com/Reports/American_History/American_Imperialism.shtml

"The United States became an imperialist nation at
the end of the 19th century because Americans
wanted to expand over seas with their belief in
manifest destiny. The three factors that started
American imperialism were political and military
competition including the creation of a strong
naval force, economic competition among industrial
nations and a belief in the racial and cultural
superiority of people of Anglo-Saxon decent. The
Spanish American War marked the emergence of the
United States as a world power. This brief war
lasted less than four months from April 25 to
August 12, 1898. A number of factors contributed
to the United States decision to go to war against
Spain. These included the Cuban struggle for
independence, American imperialism and the sinking
of the United States warship �Maine�. As a result
of the war Spain ceded Guam, Puerto Rico, and the
Philippines to the United States. The United
States in turn, paid Spain $20,000,000 for public
property in the Philippine Islands. The United
States gained colonies on both sides of the
Pacific including Hawaii. On August 12, 1898
Congress took control and proclaimed Hawaii
American territory......
