	I remember back in my Crushbone days someone put a temp on me.
I ran into Crushbone and snared an orc, only a million other orcs came
too.  (Well, maybe 4 other orcs... :-)  Anyway, after a while I looked
around and all the orcs were dead and I was like WTF?  How come I'm not 
on a CR?  then I saw I had like 1000 hitpoints...
