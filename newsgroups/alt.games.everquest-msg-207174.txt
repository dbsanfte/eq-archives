Nah, they'll just fix it...they'll lose subscribers but, with any luck,
they'll only lose the whiney dicks that just rave about the "next big thing"
and the game will be better for it.

Hey, don't knock it 'till you tried it.

Most EQ players have seen and tried SWG, we know what it is and what to
expect and whehter we want to be playing it. I've read posts here of players
that love the game...Ex-EQ are often hardened to a few bugs that need
ironing out, after 4yrs of EQ Patches/Fixes/Emergency Patches ;ï¿½)

I'll say again, the less of the "this game suxx0rs" crowd on the servers the
better it'll be for the players remaining.
