Do what I did, and start another character or two, and play them until
you WANT to play the druid again  :)  I played my druid so long and so
often that I really got totally bored with the root, dot and rinse
cycle...

I have had lots of fun with beastlord, monk and mage characters, and
when I DO dust off the druid at least it doesn't feel like a chore any
more.
