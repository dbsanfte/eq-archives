It always cycles through the available mobs in the same order.  The
only caveat is that sometimes it will target the same one twice the
first time you use the function.  For best results, ensure that at
least one other mob is visible so that it will cycle, and hit the
button until at least two mobs you know are distinct have been
targeted, then just keep hitting the button to see if it ever targets
the "one" in front of you twice.  It may sound like a lot of work but
honestly it takes me all of a second to decide if it is one mob or
multiples.

As an enchanter on Combine, a ranger who always helps the enchanter,
and a necro, I have trained myself to almost always target with the
cycle function.  It solves so many problems I really think it was a
mistake making it a "hidden" function.  (Lots of people know where the
target nearest button is but have no idea how to cycle.)
