Easy...one cast of Slow and you'd get aggro.  If somehow you didn't, the
second attempt surely would.  If that doesn't stick you're dead.

POD wasn't made for a high 40s-low 50s group.  Undoubtely in a year
everyone's twinks will be there (that aren't already there, like yours) at
that level, but right now you'd be chewed up and spit out.  Chardok is tough
enough for folks with mains in their lower 50s.
