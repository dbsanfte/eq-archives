I have a tendancy to consider the source material for just who wants PvP.

As much as I gathered from the web site, Az and Ronald McDonald are butt
buddies. You have to remember that I played on the same shard as Ron and
found him to be pretty much a pathological idiot. I'm not talking about I.Q.
or ability to communicate, I am talking about being a useless lying piece of
shit who never told a straight account of what really happened to him or
found a cheat he didn't use.

These clowns were repeatedly banned from the game for cheating. I don't mean
little cheats, I mean massive cheats like hacking stats and skills to god
like levels. Ron recieved 3 temporary bans for hacking characters and was in
jail on what would have been his perma ban when he quit the game. He can't
help himself, compulsive assholism is his trademark.

Think about this a minute. I can train my friggin dog not to take food off
my kitchen table. He has a fundamental understanding of what is wrong and
not to do it These compulsive idiots can not be trained to stop cheating in
a silly game. My dog is more socialized then these retards and he isn't even
that bright.

They are really just liars trying to con people. They aren't looking for a
fair fight or a challenge. They are hoping for another lousy implementation
that is full of bugs and holes so they can once again start their boorish
behavior.
