I only want the ability to set the clip plane per zone, to save me
zeroing it in the Bazaar and re-extending it in the field.

And to have the correct animation (crouch) when you start a Bind Wound
during the standing-up animation of the previous Bind Wound.

And for the ALT key to tooltip the names of my equipped items when I have the
inventory window open.

And for the last pixel or two of text on the new UI chat window to be visible.

And a compass for Track (like the new SH one) instead of having it write e.g.
	Gorenaire is behind you.
	Gorenaire is behind you.
	Gorenaire is behind you.
	Gorenaire is behind you.
	Gorenaire is behind you.
all the damn time.

And for some in-game offline messaging, so you can leave notes for people
next time they come in.

And for notification when someone on your Friends list logs in, to save
having to check.

And for a Cancel button for spells that were cast by mistake (unless in
combat, for balance).

And for macros and chat window titles that contain an asterisk to save 
themselves properly (get a good XML library, VI).

Nothing much.
