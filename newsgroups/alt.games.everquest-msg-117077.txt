Aaaah...I love helping out the true newbies.  I found a level 1 Druid in
Kelethin last night.  Either a true newbie, or a VERY good actress... (c;

Anyway, I've been hanging out in Paw and Lake Rathe for a while for kicks,
and bank was overflowing.  I found the ones that seemed to be actual
newbies, and handed out Split Paw Tunics, Gloves, Belts, assorted Fine
Steel, a Runed Totem Staff , a Skull of Jhen Tra, and threw in some buffs to
boot.

They were extremely grateful, and really didn't know what to say.  I just
told em to have fun, and pass the stiff on when they outgrow it.

One of the things I love about EQ.
