2 issues:
First:
If that were the case I'd just get an invis & sow and run to each book 
before I hit level 10 and newbie gate home.

I'd do it once, I'd never do it again. It doesn't accomplish that much, imo.

Second:
Some guy would invariably forget he hadn't done one with his alt, commit 
to an LDoN or something... and then the group would wait an extra hour 
for him to show up :)
