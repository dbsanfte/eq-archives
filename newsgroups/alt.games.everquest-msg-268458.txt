The island and ship is a bit of a double edge sword. For a total
newbie to EQ like me it's was great. Although I did end up shouting,
"How do I get off this *$%^$ island?" But when I did I found Qeynos
very big and daunting and thought, "Can I go back to the island? I
knew what was happening back there!"

On the other hand the first char I create is really the one I end up
playing. And after several tweaks to various chars I was totally sick
of the place. Would like to go back and tweak another char but the
thought of running thought the same quests for the 7th time is very
off putting!!
