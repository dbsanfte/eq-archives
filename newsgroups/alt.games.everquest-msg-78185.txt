While reading up on weapons for my warrior, I came across an ongoing
argument about dual-wielding different weapons: one side maintained that the
fastest weapon should be in the primary slot while the others were convinced
that, if the secondary weapon was slower than the main, it would skip every
other round.

Who was right and how does this work?
