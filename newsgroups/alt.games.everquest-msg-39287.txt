The xp system is pretty straightforward, according to the ShowEQ folk
who HAVE worked out the mathematics.

Mobs give xp that is a zone-wide factor times the square of their level.
This leads directly to the conclusion that at low levels you're better
off (xp wise) killing the highest level things you can, even if it's slower.
At high levels, you're much better off killing larger numbers of weaker
opponents.

Loot does not matter directly.  It's purely what zone you're in (dungeon
zones tend to have a higher multiplier, as do zones that Verant wants to
encourage people to use because they're not crowded) and what level the
mob is.

I won't disagree, but it's because Verant chose to have a higher xp
modifier for OT than Rathe and Oasis, and chose to give giants more HP
for their level than cactuses, rather than a direct relationship between
loot and xp.
