Or me, my second PC (Human and Erudite males off, as they look so crap) and
that randomly carashes to desktop when zoning. Has happened twice now, first
time I tried to get back in and crashed back to desktop just before
character select screen, I rebooted and it worked fine. Second time Crashed
to desktop on zone, tried to get in, back to desktop at character select,
this time tho I didn't reboot just fired up EQ again and went straight in,
no problems...odd.

I wouldn't call it a common occurence for me so I'm not too bothered as yet
but I'd rather it didn't happen at all.
