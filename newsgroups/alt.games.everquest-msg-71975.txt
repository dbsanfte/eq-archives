Whatever. Yes, I'm lying to you. For whatever reason, I'm fucking
lying to you just for the sake of lying. Goodbye, dickwad. I totally
despise being called a liar when you have absolutely NO fucking way of
validating the claim. You're so sure that I'm lying with zero proof.
You're so dead-set that you're right that you'll refuse to beleive
anything that gives even the illusion of the slightest possibility
that you're wrong.

Fine, stay in your own little world. You're not worth arguing with if
you're that closed-minded and self-deluded. *plonk*
