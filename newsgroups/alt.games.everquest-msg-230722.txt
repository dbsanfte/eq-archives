My 61 enchanter uses Shiftless over Forlorn because it's a faster
cast (due to a Spell Haste II item.)  When fighting mobs that can
kill the tank in a few lucky rounds if they're unslowed, it's much
more important to get the fight under control QUICKLY.  After slow
lands, 65% vs 70% really just means a bit more of the cleric's
mana.
