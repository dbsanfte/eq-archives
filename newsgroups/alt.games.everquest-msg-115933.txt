Yes, you will totally give up on melee soon. You are around the level that
that happens. As others have suggested, if you are in a balanced group, you
can contribute 10 times more by medding than you can by meleeing. as the
enchanter, even when the situation looks to be in control, you will need to
be medding up some mana *just in case*. If you are meleeing and at 50%
mana... what happens if you get trained with 2-3 more mobs? if you are
Medding and therefore at 80% mana, you should be able to handle the adds, if
you are distracted and meleeing, you may not be able to.
