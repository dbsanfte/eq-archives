I was wondering if any one could help me with a slight problem that I am
having.

I'm currently trying to organize my spell book with no
luck. I've tried searching the various websites put the to see if any other
wizard has done this, but I couldn't find an example.  If anyone has any
suggestions or knows a site that could help out, I would be very grateful.

I'm also having difficulty choosing a trade skill for my wizard.  I was
thinking of trying my hand at tailoring, since I need better armor than
cloth (any suggestions on type of armor?). If anyone has any suggestions,
please let me know.
