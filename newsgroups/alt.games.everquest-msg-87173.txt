Either I need to take writing clarity classes or you need to take
reading comprehension classes.

The 16 online when they petitioned were not nearly enough to take
Sev.

The 21 they eventually fought with were.

I am not sure what part of that wasnt clear, but I'll give you the
benefit of the doubt, and my writing skills the assumption of ineptitude,
because the alternative would be to assume you were firing off replies
without bothering to read the text first. Which would never happen
on Usenet.
