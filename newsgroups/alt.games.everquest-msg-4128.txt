This viewpoint always cracks me up.  Why would you care?  If I were
standing in front of you in reality I could see that what you are
wearing is a Minotaur Ribcage and not a Banded Tunic (or shirt or
whatever they are called).  In the game you cant because they have the
same graphic.  That is just one example.

For the life of me I will never understand why people get all bent out
of shape and think it is rude to inspect without asking.  To me I
think it is just silly that it should even matter to you that I can
see what you are wearing and equipping.
