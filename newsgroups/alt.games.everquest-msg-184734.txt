I would recommend a Beastlord without hesitation. I have an Enchanter
and my Wife has a Beastlord which we have levelled to 54 almost
exclusively playing just the two of us.

With the Beastlord you get a top-notch Tank which they can heal for
impressive amounts (1250hp at lvl 55). Almost every area is taken care
of:

Tank     - BST Pet (and your animation)
Healing  - Pet healing is in a similar league to Cleric heals
           BST can heal you for 100hp from mid-levels on
DD       - Both of you get some reasonable DDs plus BST pet procs
DOT      - ENC DOTs take too long to work - plus you can't mezz DOTd
           mobs but both you and the BST get them should you wish
Snare    - Nope (but you can root, and it's pets that get hit)
Fear     - You got that
Slow     - Both get slow spells though Enc is much better
Haste    - BST can haste Pet. You can haste animation.
Stun     - Use the Color series. Live by it. It is awesome. 
           Stun-locking is an incredibly good way of taking out 
           tough mobs. BST pet procs have stun capability too.
Mana     - Breeze/Clarity/C2/KEI. At later levels BST gets 
           mana+health regen. At 54 with C2 and Spiritual Radiance 
           we get better mana regen than KEI
Crowd    - You, obviously
Control
Taunting - BST pets are excellent taunters
Debuffs  - You - including some awesome slows
Buffs    - You get some nice AC spells - BST gets a few resist buffs
porting  - Nope (still you got PoK books and /join taxi :)
SoW      - Beastlords get that (at lvl 30 I think)
Levitate,- You both get all three of these (plus IVU for Enc too)
Invis,
EB

In my opinion, Beastlords are one of the most underrated classes in
the game.
