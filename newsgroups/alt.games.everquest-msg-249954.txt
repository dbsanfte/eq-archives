Hi gang!

I tried to launch EQ tonight, and at the patch screen it started to download
a file called drv_idl.wav.  It downloads half the file in about a second and
then hangs up.  I then get a message stating I don't have access to the
file.

I checked my sony folder and the only file with the same name is in my
/trilogy/sounds folder, and it was created 2 years ago.  Should I try
deleting it and running the patcher again?

Lou
