   I don't know that it's really possible to answer your question right
now.  The game is in Beta, and I would guess that the typical beta has more
time to sink into the game than you might.  I know this isn't the most
useful of answers, but it is the one that springs to my mind.

   Well, one question I would ask myself is "Is it likely I can achieve
those goals in EQLive due to my time constraints?"  As for the characters,
yeah, it is sad to leave them behind.  But making a brand new start with
one can be exhilarating too.  

   It doesn't have to be an either/or situation.  You cancel EQL, try EQII,
then go back to the first if you find that is your preference.  Of course,
then you're out the cost of the game for EQII, which might be some cause to
pause.
