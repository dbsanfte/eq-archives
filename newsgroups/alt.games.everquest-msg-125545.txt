I've played monk/shaman and loved it. My only problem was that shaman 
got very little action outside of casting regen/slow/very few heals, so 
his skills were far behind

My friend played cleric/warrior and liked it as well. My guess is that 
he had tougher time levelling, but had more demanded characters in the 
end.

Others I've seen but can't comment on:
paladin/enchanter
necro/shaman (shaman is a regen bitch, I'm assuming)
necro/mage
bard/rogue
