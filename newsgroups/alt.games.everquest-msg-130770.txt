Took my lvl 30 DE SK from FR to BB using the translocators and was
attacked when I landed in OT. Dmage was light and managed tp  hail and
get the relya out of OT quickly. No attack on the dock in BB, but
immediately jumped in the water and started swimming south.
Ironically, the FP boat was at the dock, but did not bother. Also did
not attempt the ride to Kunark for obvious reasons. LOL!!

May be a problem for loweer lvl KoS's in OT, so be very careful.
