I'm personally affronted by the fact that they presented it as a
"solo nerf" when its clearly an "all groups nerf"... IF you want
to call it a solo nerf then it applies to all camps game wide,
since the only thing that happened to soloers is that grouping
got better.  And the POP nerf applied to all groups but groups >
one didn't notice it so much since the boost to group exp covered
the loss.

The difference is, playing in zones Other than POP got better
(because grouping there got an exp boost with no penalty)

I dunno, the distinction mainly annoys me due to the "spin"
mentality of calling it a solo nerf, yes, the effect is sort of
like that, but its inaccurate and in my opinion in this case
deliberately deceitful.  It also focussed attention on POP, when
the real effect should have been to spread the players out more,
back into old zones like Seb where there are still high level
mobs and where a closer parity to POP experience combined with
easier killing -should- have brought in some happy groups;
instead by focussing on calling it a Solo nerf, they what, got
soloers to move out of POP?  No, cause other zones still suck
compared to POP.  Got soloers to group?  The Group boost would do
that, and did, but reducing POP exp has nothing to do with that.

Could be I'm not getting enough cheese though.
