>What are guilds?

Guilds are player-made organizations for accomplishing a variety of goals.
Exactly what those goals are depends a lot on the people in the guild.
There are guilds of RL friends who just use the guild interface as a chat
program. There are funky-theme guilds (say, gnomes only) whose sole purpose
is to be silly and let people play alt characters and blow off some steam.
There are uber guilds, who put all other considerations (friendship,
decency, respectability) behind killing and killing and killing and trying
to prove they are the "best" at killing high level stuff in the game. Lots
of other kinds as well.

>  How does one join one?  Are there level requirements?

Exact methods of joining guilds varies as much as the nature of the guild
itself. Stay away from the cattle-call guilds where officers hang out in
east commons or Gfay and admit anyone who has any interest at all. Those
guilds are just wretched. Best way to find a guild for you is to stay
unguilded for a long while, and find out who you like to play with. Odds
are, the guild they belong to will have people similar to them...join that
guild.

>Can I purchase all of the spells (I'm a halfling druid) that are my spell
>level?

You can buy any spell in the game...generally it is best to stick to the
spells of your current level (or, if you are about to level to a new spell
rank, buy them in advance so that when you level you can immediately
memorize them).

>  Will there be enough room in the spellbook in the later levels?

The spellbook has 50 pages of 5 spells each page, or 250 total spell slots.
Even very high spell count classes like enchanters and shamans can only
fill about half of the book. Don't worry about it.

>What does the meditate button in the spellbook do?  I think it helps
>regenerate mana but I don't have the meditate skill (I will as soon as I
>make level 8, I'm level 7 now.).

The meditate button is a relic from before. Used to be, that when you sat
down to open the spellbook and meditate, you had to use the mouse to click
the meditate button in order to get the full benefit of meditating. Someone
pointed out that nobody EVER sits down and doesn't click this, so why not
just have it be automatically clicked when you open the book. And now it
is. Probably when Shadows of Luclin comes out, they will re-vamp the
spellbook interface and get rid of the button entirely.

>Not that I'm anywhere near level 30, but what are the pros and cons to
>specializing in each, um, specialty?  (Abjure, Alteration, Conjuration,
>Divination, Evocation)?

Being specialized in a skill means that when you try and cast a spell based
on that skill, there is a chance that the mana cost will be halved. Care
needs to be taken here, the first spell ability that you specialize over 50
in becomes your prime specialization (and it can then reach 200), all the
other specializations will cap at 50. So your prime specialization has a
much greater chance of taking effect than the minor ones. For a druid, your
best bet would be either alteration or evocation. Alteration for your
buffs, teleports, and heals, evocation for your nukes. Druids are one of
the few classes where there isn't an obvious and clear-cut choice for what
the prime specialization should be (any wizard, for example, who does not
specialize primarily in evocation is a complete moron).

>What are misty acorns used for?  (So far I've only managed to sell them to
>other players for a tidy profit.)

Probably some halfling racial armor. Not sure.

>Why are honeycombs so sought after?  (Again, I've sold them to other
>players.)

Rivervale quest, don't know the specifics of it.

>Why am I the only person who fishes for my food?  It's the cheapest way to
>get food  (4 copper per bait) and a way to make some nickel and dime money
>for newbies (when you fish out a rusty dagger).

Food is pretty cheap to begin with, and the time you spend fishing is being
used by other people to hunt critters and make a lot more money.

>Why is spiderling silk so popular?  (Aside from being able to use it to make
>silk threads and using them in recipes for containers...unless that's the
>reason?)

That is the reason.

>What are the skill levels?
>1-10 - Awful
>11-20 Very Bad
>21-30 Bad... (What next?  Do I have the numbers right?  How high does it
>go?)

Pretty sure that each of the "levels" of skill are broken down in sections
of 10...once you get to 100, you are at "master" level, and rather than
having to guess at the skill, the window will show the actual number.

Awful, Very Bad, Bad, Poor, Below Average, Average, Above Average, Good,
Very Good, Excellent, Master...something like that.
