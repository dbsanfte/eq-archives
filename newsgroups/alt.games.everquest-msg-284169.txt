So I've been playing my little gnome SK on Combine, and have noticed I'm 
grouping a lot with players from a certain guild; not just a cluster of 
5 of them, but 10 or so, either in groups where I'm the only one not in 
the guild, or where there are just two or three from that guild and some 
random others.

I decided to go look into joining their guild, and discovered their 
"wanted players" list... three classes were closed to recruitment; monk, 
necromancer, and SK.

Doh!

Here's their list:

Bard - Medium Need
Beastlord - Open when Available
Berserker - Open when Available
Cleric - High Need
Druid - Medium Need
Enchanter - High Need
Magician - High Need
Monk - CLOSED
Necromancer - CLOSED
Paladin - Low Need
Ranger - Medium Need
Rogue - Low Need
Shadow Knight - CLOSED
Shaman - Medium Need
Warrior - Medium Need
Wizard - High Need

Sorting by "need" instead of alphabetically

High Need
Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Wizard

Medium Need
Bard, Druid, Ranger, Shaman, Warrior

Low Need
Paladin, Rogue

Open later
Beastlord (Luclin), Berserker (LOY?  I forget)

Closed
Monk, Necromancer, SK.

So whats the reasoning there?

Warrior, I can see filling up rapidly; basically a class that doesn't 
stack well, because their primary function is taking a serious beating. 
  How many does a guild really need?  Enough that you've always got one 
on every raid, and another waiting in the wings in case he goes LD or 
something.

But as "backup" tanks and off tanks, its my impression that paladins and 
SK's serve better; they aren't ideal as MT but will do if you lose your 
warrior, and they can grab adds et al as needed, meanwhile serving in 
other utility modes that the warriors really can't.  I'd think if you 
wanted, say, 6 tanks in your guild, that you'd want two warriors and two 
SK's and two Paladins, rather than 4 Warrior and one each of the 
Knights.  So I'm surprised to see paladins ranked lower than warriors, 
and SK's completely off the list.

Even more surprising to me than this, though, is that rogue is showing 
as Low Need.  Rogues are a DPS class, sustained DPS probably the best in 
the game.  For Burst you'll still look to wizards and mages, but day in 
and day out, can you have too many rogues?

I guess what I'm really looking at is based on what they already have 
signed up; perhaps their need for warriors is higher than I'd think 
because they happen to have very few at the moment, and their need for 
SK's is lower than I'd expect because a lot of people signed up with them.

But it did get me thinking; what would the "food pyramid" of classes 
look like in the ideal guild, assuming everyone was equally talented at 
playing their classes?
