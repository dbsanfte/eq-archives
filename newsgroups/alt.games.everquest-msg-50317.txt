To tell you the truth, Kevin, I think there is a general 'NO' against this
idea.  And I am one of them.  I am only a Pally, and can nicely fit all my
melee spells into the eight slots, although because I can't fit my buffs I
would like what someone else suggested, another spell set that you can open
up in one click, even if it did take some time to do so.  But even this is a
bit extraordinary.  I mean, what is the spell book then used for apart from
scribing and then memming into slots, only to be shut until the next set of
spells.  I don't think this sounds too Roleplaying to me.  I think that a
'RL' wizard would be consulting his spell book all the time.  Don't like it?
Be a warrior.  The rest of us don't mind it.
