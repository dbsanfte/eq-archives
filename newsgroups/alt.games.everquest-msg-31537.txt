If that were the reason for it, the law would say "No oral sex IN
PUBLIC PLACES"...

The game was set up as a fantasy environment. True, there are modern
nods in the form of NPC names in that environment, but they are done
in such a way as to not break the environment. Many players
participate in the game to take part in that environment. The naming
policy was set up to support the environment. If seeing a name like
"Lostme Marbles" diminishes the environment for a player, and the
rules are there prohibiting such names, then that player is well
within their rights to report it. It may be stupid to you if you do
not play to participate in the environment. But it is not your place
to criticize another for reporting it because they do wish to do so.

Then again, your example contained a real world law, which is higher
than simple "rules", and thus open to sterner scrutiny. I was speaking
of rules in a privately run community in which participation is
totally voluntary and has no real impact on the real world.
