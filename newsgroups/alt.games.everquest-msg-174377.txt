I paid 7k for the copy that I cast every 150 minutes.

About 2 months ago I bought another copy for 7k, had you asked me then I
would've said come to Tarew Marr and bring 10k.  I resold it very fast for
15k.

Doesn't work indoors.
Hate ultravision, makes everything bleached out.
SoE is faster (and keeps me from splatting, which I'd do a lot if I didn't
use SoE)
Faction issues get me killed. (Hail, High Guardian of Justice...Hey, what's
that big metal spiked pole you're jamming up my rectum? NO, YOUR 12 FRIENDS
WONT FIT THEIRS IN TOO, ARGH!! *die*)
