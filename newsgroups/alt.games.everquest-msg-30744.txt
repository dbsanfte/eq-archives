Well it depends what you fight. Aviak egrets are level 13-15, darters
are 16-18. No, you probably won't get many hits in against deep red
level 30 Avocets, so don't pull them, and if you do by accident, run -
Lake Rathe zone is but a stone's throw away. You may need to take along
a druid or ranger to harmony pull stuff out of the treehouse without
bringing all the harriers and avocets (easy enough, especially with lev,
you can harmony and pull away from the treehouse even if you're a few
levels up - they don't aggro so the puller can get right up close to
harmony)

Similarly, you can probably take on centaur foals and shelties, but not
coursers and chargers - just con everything in the zone and if it is red
bear in mind it may be *very* red at 19.

If all the other groups are a few levels higher, they are probably
killing rooks and harriers, clearing away egrets and darters as annoying
trash PHs for the stuff they want. So start your own
high-teens/low-twenties group and mop up all the 'trash' for them -
theres usually a few players around that level milling about looking
lost there that you could organise into a group.

> I was afraid to kill the centaurs!  No bad faction, then?

No bad faction, but they melee hard and fire annoying arrows at you.
Easy enough to kite, or root and dot or whatever (provided you then wait
out of range of their arrows - they don't hit for much compared to melee
attacks though).


> Well, I guess it doesn't matter *anyway*.  No bread quest. :)

I may be imagining it, but I don't think the other runs have been
xp-nerfed quite so badly, just the SK-NK bread run. I was porting to
Feerott to give bread to innkeep Gub for faction, and still seeing some
movement in my blue bar (not much, I'm 33 now, but maybe it's still
appreciable xp at level 19). Of course, this isn't much help if you
can't port.

The ones you're fighting or the ones near enough to share their
hatelist...


> and *some* conned dubious :/

all the other ones. This is what I meant by 'some races can sell to the
Aviak vendor'. Wood elves, for example, are usually only apprehensive,
and some classes are dubious but can sneak behind Krak Windchaser, etc.
