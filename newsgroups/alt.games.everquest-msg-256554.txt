I have no practical knowledge here, never bought that AA for any 
character and don't even know which classes can get it.

However, that's never stopped me speculating before.

Channeling is the skill used to see whether you are interrupted while 
trying to cast a spell if you are hit or moved.

That being the case, next question is, which classes regularly end up 
casting while being beat on?

Well, shaman, who may find it helpful to let mobs beat up on them while 
they run stoicism/torpor/quintessence and let their pets do the killing.

Clerics, who end up getting hit occaisionally in a "Cheal or don't 
bother" situation... and who also end up needing to punch out a DA or a 
stun or a root when doing that Chealing job gets them the love.

Enchanters, who are the only class thats regularly expected to handle 
-all- the adds, and who can do so if they can just get that damn spell off.

Druids and wizards, who are responsible for getting that Evac off when 
things have gone badly wrong.

In short, most casters, exceptions being mage and necromancer, who don't 
professionally get beat on all that much.

Grage, 48 Berserker
Splendid One, 65 Mage
Bergh, 65 Cleric
