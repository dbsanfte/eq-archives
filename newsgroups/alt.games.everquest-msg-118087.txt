The way I read it was that you spammed a non-commercial newsgroup with
commercial requests in violation of the TOS of your email provider.  Also,
by requesting that people break the TOS of Sony/VI, you would be breaking

Good luck in life.  It does seem that you have an inability to understand
that your own actions/attitudes will cause any and all reactions that seem
to be inflicted upon you.
