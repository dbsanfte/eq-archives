    I can think of one time when I used them: Unrest, pulling to the wall,
no enchanter with us. Used the cleric PB AoE line spells to smoke the Death
Beetle adds you invariably get - I could do a boatload of damage for the
mana used, getting pounded by greens wasn't so bad that I couldn't cast
again and kill them all, and killin g them was easier on the mana pool than
healing the damage they caused.

    I love the new quest NPC in NKarana. You can give him five gold to raise
bad guy factions in Qeynos, even when you're at Dubious to Corrupt Guards
(he's also a Corrupt Guard). Then, walk over to the seven spawn Bandit camp
and cast Earthquake (which JUST kills the bandits, more or less, and can get
them all just in radius) to regain the lost good Guards faction. With the
new "your faction can't get better" messages, I can figure out exactly when
good Guards is capped again and stop killing bandits.
