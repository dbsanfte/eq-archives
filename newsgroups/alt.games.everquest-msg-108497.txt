1. charity:
"generosity and helpfulness especially toward the needy or suffering; also :
aid given to those in need"

 --- im not in need. im not suffering. i said i didnt "need" anything.

2. earnestly:
"grave, important" synonym: serious
entreat:
"to plead with especially in order to persuade : ask urgently"

 --- its not important i get anything. its not a serious situation.

by those definitions im not begging :)
