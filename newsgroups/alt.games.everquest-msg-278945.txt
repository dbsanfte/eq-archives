Yeah, I'm talking about the pre-order on a live server.  There are two
ways to get into the zone (one zone, two names - "Delving into the
Darkness" and "Captive Audience").  The first is to run up to a
transporter, right click and use it.  The second is to get into a fight
with the group of gnolls around the transporter and the 'abductor' will
kidnap you and throw you into the 'Captive Audience' zone.  I know of
two transporters, on the north side of the north road in TS.  One is
near the griffon fields area, but near the east mountain that lines
that area (I think that is where it is, only saw it once).  The other
is just past Tower 2, next to the west mountains that box in that
undead starter area.

Getting the starting quest might require a zone or log before it is
added to your journal.  I had that problem also.
