Yeah, I know, but I thought it was one that fit. =)

Okay, I can accept that. However the same could happen if you lost SoW
on your way out of the zone. I'm not trying to nit-picK ( =) ) here or
anything, I was just curious. With my SoW-capable characters, I make
sure that everyone has it on because I know that my Non-SoW-capable
characters would want it if the situation were reversed. I think the
original statement just came off a little like the underlying complaint
in this whole thread that if you're grouped with a SoWer, it's expected
that you'll get one. To me, my Mana may be better used in another
capacity sometimes. If we're fighting near a zone line, then there's no
real reason to keep SoW on people. I'd be better off saving that Mana
for heals and buffs. That was pretty much all I was saying.
