Everquest in general.
Or, your own stupidity.....no, Im not attacking you.
For example....I play a shaman.  I camped the orc chief for part of the
totemic on and off for about 2 weeks.  His tongue is an uncommon drop or
something like that.  I bet you I put in 50 hours to get that dam thing.  I
coulda just bought the piece of armor from all the cp and sp I got from the
camp.  Finally, I log on one day, theres the chief....bam bam...I get the
tongue.  I go to bank it....and I TRADE IT TO THE BANKER.
Or, after selling some stuff, noticing I was overloaded, decide to destroy
my cp.  Well, after destroying 1.5k in pp I learned I should pay attention
to what I grab and destroy a bit better.
Oh....the totemic helm....that was a good one to.  Quested on and off for a
bit for the pelt.....finally got it.  I get the gem, everything I need.  I
go off and get the helm.  Wohoo, I was so happy.  Just out of curiousity, I
wanted to know what a vendor would by it for.  Well, I accidently sold it to
the vendor.
Picture a 35 year old man, fairly educated, stable, and emotionally
secure....looking at a computer screen with his jaw on the floor and tears
running down his face....and his girlfriend over his shoulder saying
"Dear....its only a silly helmet"
By the way, shes an ex now.
Now, mind you, I have been playing for 3 years.  I *dont* always do dumb
things like that.  :)
The game is fun, the quests can be very frustrating.   Overall though, I
would have to say....dont take it (or the quests) to seriously....and if you
do, learn how to have fun doing it....or, youll drive yourself bonkers.
