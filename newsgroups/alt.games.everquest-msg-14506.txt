Bizbee, it's time to loosen your tie, your brain's not getting
enough oxygen.

Nowhere did I "invoke the force of semantics one second" (and
thus I could not contradict myself on it "the next").  My
original post(s) in this thread had nothing to do with semantics,
they had to do with Verant's motivations (oh, excuse me, let me
reword that for the dim-witted:  "it had to do with the motivations
of the people setting Verant policy").  That's not a semantic
argument in any way, you imbecile.

Then, out of nowhere, you decided to go off on a tear and
make a total jackass of yourself by bitching that I had used
"Verant" as a synecdoche (look it up, half-wit) for the
people in charge of their policies (which is such a common
literary contrivance when referring to corporate actions that
the same shorthand is used in headlines and articles in
every news organization in the country).  I can't believe
that set you off into a fit of jackassedness, but it did.

Then, when I point out that it's a very common figure of
speech (one that's used here on a daily basis by countless
posters), you come back with a bizarre riff about how
I'm supposedly "invoking semantics" then "blowing it
out of the water", when *you're* the asshole who first
actually invoked semantics here for no damned good reason
by freakishly fixating on the trivial fact that I
wrote "Verant" instead of "the people who run/work for
Verant", then stupidly accused me of perhaps not
being clear on the difference, when *you* were the one
who couldn't grasp that it was a common compositional
shorthand.

Seek help, Bizbee.  I'm absolutely serious.  There's
something very disturbed about your recent posts here.


>Speaking of morons, I'd say you're doing a hell of a job yourself.

Keep it up, Bizbee, I'll stand here and let you dig yourself
deeper all day long.

What's the matter, did your anti-asshole medication run out?
You've really been on an incoherent, bile-filled riff recently.
