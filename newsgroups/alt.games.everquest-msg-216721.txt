Ok I gonna touch a nerve or 2.   Was browsing around the web for
guides and saw  an "Organzation" that for a fee (Per level) they will
play your character to a level that u want.

Now I admit , sounds good.  I got 2 characters which I cant seem to go
no where.  I tried free guides, grouped and died and I dont seem to
make headway.  The characters in question 42 Enchanter (Which took
almoxt a month to make 1 level)  and 37 druid.

Also finding out that an Enchanter doesnt solo well and believe or not
I have a hard time grouping,  The times that I do group I get positive
feed back about doing "Enchanter Duties".   A couple times players
have giving me advice.  I dont think im that bad.  I have not lost
anyone in group yet.

Any way back to your opinion about people accepting cash for leveling


I would like for people to speak their peace.
Flames and insults accepted I learn for them also.

Happy hunting
