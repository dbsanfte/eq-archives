>> What lvl is good to solo twilight as a Ranger?

Can't take any responsibility for the following, stole it off of someones 
post to my previous guilds message board:

Q: Why does it rain so much in the Karanas? 
A: Because everytime a ranger dies, Tunare sheds a tear. 

Q: How can you tell a ranger tried to break into your house?? 
A: Your cat is camping his corpse. 

Q: Why don't rangers get FD? 
A: Because the fall to the ground would kill them. 

Q: What do you call a Warrior with no arms and no legs? 
A: I don't know, but it's better than a Ranger. 

Q: How do you know when a ranger has been tanking? 
A: You're on CR. 

Q: Why is ranger armor green and brown? 
A: Green so they can find their corpse in the dirt and brown 
so they can find their corpse on the grass. 

Q: Why is a Ranger like a cheap $20.00 whore? 
A: They go DOWN on anything and everything 

Q: Whats the shortest Ranger joke ever? 
A: LFG. 

Q: what do you call a druid that doesnt have any spells and thinks he can 
melee? 
A: A ranger! 

Q: What is the difference between a ranger and a corpse? 
A: 30 seconds of combat! 

Q: What did one ranger say to the other at the soulbinder? 
A: Do you come here often? 

Q: Why did the Ranger cross the road ? 
A: Because the chicken got him down to half a bub ! 

Things to ask rangers :
Ask if they need to get Aego before going in out door zones just in case 
it rains and they start losing HP. 

Ask them if they've made a "/consent" hotkey yet to save time. 

Ask them why they came to this raid, since there will be no need for them 
to eat any DT's. 

Misc: 
Ranger - Tank Simulator 
/shout TRAIN TO ZONE!!! RANGERS AND CHILDREN FIRST!! 
A_Random_Guildie says, "What does this MOB drop?" 
You say, "RANGERS!" 

A Ranger walks into a bar.... LOADING PLEASE WAIT. 

Just after Kunark was released and epic discusions were rife. General 
consensus was that the ranger epic would proc "resurrection". 

It's more mana-efficient to res a ranger then heal one. 

Monk (pulling): "Incoming, random_mob_o1 times three!!" 
Raid Leader: "Off yer butz! Meleers to the front, casters step 
back....rangers....try to look as if you are contributing."
