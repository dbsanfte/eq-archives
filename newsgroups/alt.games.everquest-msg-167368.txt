Ill take a shot and try and answer your question. Beastlords, in my
experience, are absolutely ferocious PvP'ers. A good selection of Buffs for
self and pet, a pet that is, in my opinion, the absolutely best out there,
and decent melee skills. My usual tactic when PvP'ing is to lead off with
blind, followed by sending the pet in. Keep your opponenet blind for as long
as you can. He cant hit what he cant see. make sure your pet has his best
proc up. The procs are what make the warder so good in PvP. Also, dont be
afraid to wade in and Melee yourself a bit. Were not exactly a dress waring
class ya know ;) From my eperience if I can keep an opponent Blinded Ive got
the fight won.

Now that all said Im not going to say the PvP with a Beastlord is all cake.
Like any skill it will take time to master, but the tools that have been
handed to a BST are truly effective when you know how to use them.
