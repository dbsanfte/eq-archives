I'm going to tag onto my own post.  *I* thought the name my neice chose was on

>I did the honorable thing:  I waited til VERY late at night, when things were
>slow.  Then I begged the GM in a short but eloquent statement about how sorry

>And patient.  It took over an hour, but they DID change her name.
