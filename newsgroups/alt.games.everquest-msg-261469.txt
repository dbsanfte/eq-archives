I am guessing you only moved the FILES from the root directory on the 
harddrive. EQ also creates numerous SUBDIRECTORIES that would need to be 
moved with the files. Once you have everything under the directory where the 
game file resides it should not need to patch everything. If you did move 
everything under the directory, I am guessing that you must have installed 
from some really old CD and have a slow dial up (or both).
It should run fine from a removable drive, though if you are trying to run 
it over a USB1 connection I am going to guess you will have serious trouble 
with load times etc.
