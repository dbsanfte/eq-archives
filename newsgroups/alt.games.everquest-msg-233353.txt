Crowd control in the basest sense is preventing an overwhelming number of
mobs from killing a group of adventurers by allowing the group to focus on
one mob at a time unhindered.  There are several ways to succeed.  In many
situations the best class for this job is the enchanter, who has available
to her a majority of the CC techniques.  Mezmerization are spells that
completely stop a mobs actions; it won't move, attack, or cast until it
takes some type of damage or the spell wears off.  Mez is available to
enchanters (who can mez single targets and also have an ae mez that mez
several targets), bards, and necromancers (necromancers are limited to
mezing all mobs 55 and under or undead mobs 65 and under).  Root is also a
viable form of CC.  A rooted mob is unable to move, but will still attack
anyone close to it and can still cast spells.  Root is available to clerics,
paladins, shamans, necromancers, wizards, enchanters, druids, and rangers.
In a less strict sense of the word pacify can also be considered a form of
CC.  Pacify lowers the aggro radius on mobs, meaning a player can get close
to a mob without attacking attacing her.  Pacify is a preventative method.
A full room of mobs can be pacified and a single one pulled from within.
Pacify is available to enchanters, clerics, bards, paladins (only for mobs
up to level 55), and necromancers (only undead mobs up to level 45).

I think that is a fairly good explination; I'm sure other will have more to
add.
