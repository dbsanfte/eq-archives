> An Associated Press news story recently caught my attention. The story
> was about the release from prison this week of a Black religious leader,
> who calls himself Yahweh ben Yahweh. His name actually is Hulon
> Mitchell. He's a former Black Muslim, and, in fact, he ran a Black
> Muslim mosque in Atlanta for a while in the early 1970s, until he was
> accused of sexual improprieties with underaged Muslim girls and dipping

> so-called Nation of Yahweh, with a religion based on Judaism. He calls
> his followers "Black Hebrew Israelites" and tells them that they, rather
> than the Jews, are the "chosen people" ordained by God to rule the
> world, as described in the Old Testament. He took for himself the name
> Yahweh ben Yahweh -- that's Hebrew for "God, the son of God."

> So why should we be interested in yet another megalomaniac religious
> cult based on Judaism? Well, the thing of interest to us about the
> Nation of Yahweh is the initiation requirement Hulon Mitchell
> established for the elite, inner circle of his church, the so-called
> "Brotherhood." The requirement was the murder of a White person, and the
> bringing to Mitchell of some evidence of the murder, such as an ear or
> even the head of the victim. In fact, Mitchell preached to his whole
> congregation that the killing of White people -- of "blue-eyed devils"
> -- is pleasing to Yahweh.
>
> By the time the police finally wound up Mitchell's race-murder cult in
> November 1990 and packed Mitchell off to prison, his followers had
> butchered and mutilated at least 23 men, women, and children, 14 of them
> in Miami alone. Some of the victims were recalcitrant members of his own
> church, and the Associated Press story doesn't give a racial breakdown,
> but the figure I've seen elsewhere puts the number of White victims at
> 16. Mitchell spent a little over 10 years in prison. That works out to
> about eight months for the murder of each "blue-eyed devil." He was
> released on parole earlier this week.

> You didn't hear about it? You didn't see anything about it on CNN or
> network television? You shouldn't be surprised. It's not the sort of
> news that the bosses of the controlled media want you to know about.
> There was a story about it last Saturday in the Washington Post, but the
> entire thrust of that story is the infringement of Mitchell's civil
> rights by the conditions imposed on him by the parole board that
> released him. The Washington Post article is not headed "Black Cult
> Leader Who Ordered Ritual Murder of Whites to Be Released." Oh, no! A
> headline like that would be considered "racist" by the people who run
> the Post; they are afraid it might make White readers wary of Blacks. It
> might even lead some readers to ask questions, such as, "Why has this
> nutcase Black murderer been turned loose?" -- although I myself am not
> so optimistic about the ability of White Americans to figure out who
