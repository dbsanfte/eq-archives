Heh. I would love to get back my lvl 12 mage in Mithaniel Marr, if only 
because he was created on the day of release. When I moved to Fennin Ro 
(when it was supposed to be *the* roleplaying server, hah), I didn't want to 
have anything tying me back to the "powergamer" servers. Double hah.

Oh well... I don't suppose they have easy access to backups from three years 
ago.
