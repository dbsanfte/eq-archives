Me evil dark elf me cares nothing about dwarfs :))

Not shure if i could get to Ak'Anon but i do have a gnome or two but
on another server, to bad you can only have 8 guys on one server :)
But getting the fish that way sounds better then fighting him.

I will not be able to port but having been to cobalt scar using
hide/sneak i can stand the travel lol
