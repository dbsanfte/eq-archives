When you get high enough so that Cleric is 49+, you'll barely notice the XP
loss from a death and a res.  One quad in CS will more than make up the XP
loss.  If you can get a 56+ res or an epic res, you'll be squinting at the
XP bar, trying to see the loss.  So, I too don't mind taking a death to save
the group from a total wipe.

With our big nukes, and our right-click insta-taunt staff, we are actually
pretty good at taking one for the team.
