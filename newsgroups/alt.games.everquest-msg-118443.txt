For the simple reason that no NPC will buy the bridle,
the same way that they won't buy canines from drolvargs
or Xalgoz's fang or an Electrum Bladed Wazikashi.
Some things just won't sell back.

VI got around it by allowing a "mini-quest" that results
in a "Heavy Bag of Platinum" that CAN be sold back
to a vendor.  I'd recommend a vendor you have ally
faction with...

Female half-elf rogue with 129 chr...
first horse, buy for 7650ish, sell BoP back for 5500ish
second horse, buy for 32kish, sell BoP back for 28kish
third horse, buy for 64kish, sell BoP back for 60kish
final horse, buy for 92kish, sell BoP for 82kish

That was all four horses bought with and traded in by
the same character with 129 charisma, from an indifferent
merchant (the seller) and sold back to a max-ally rogue
vendor (whasser name in Thurgadin).

I miss my horse, but some other gear took precedence
over a toy.
