>>> Yes. I got my key the day after I bought the expansion online. You guys
may want to contact SOE about this. <<<

I pre ordered LoY. I received no key and no Email.

Yesterday, I zoned into Gulf of Gunthak and Crypt of Nadox. Killed a few
things, talked to a few NPCs, zones look interesting.

Tell me why I should contact SOE again?
