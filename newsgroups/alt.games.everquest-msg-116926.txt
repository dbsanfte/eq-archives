Yes post 45 can seem boring but only if you let it. If you stay in any zone
long enough to know all the pathings spawn points and such it becomes boring
very quick. the main reason the higher levels seem boring is it takes so
much longer to level and you end up in a zone way too long. Go to zone you
never been to Explore and take some chances. I have talked to players That
have been camping Ice Giants in Everfrost for the last 5 levels what fun is
that I was burned out with them in 30 minutes. In my humble opinion the fun
comes from dieing or just getting away or the killing blow with 25 hit
points left. At least that's what gets my blood pumping.
