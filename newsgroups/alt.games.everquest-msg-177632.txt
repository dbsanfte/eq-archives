I understand that the Test server is used for testing new features, just 
like it sounds, but I was wondering if there are any other factors someone 
should consider before starting a character there.

Are characters on Test just as safe as any other server? I mean, is there 
some disclaimer someplace that says there is a greater chance of data loss 
or the like due to typical testing of new features?

How many characters are allowed per account on Test?

Generally speaking, aside from the obvious, what are the differences 
between Test and other blue servers?
