I was messing around on one of my Navy computers (which has nothing to do
with it) so please bear with me, and i've ran across this problem, and came
up with a total logical fix, and voila, it worked.

Level 28 Warrior bound (at a home computer) in Thurgood over in Velious
camped previously the night before in East Karana, so the game loaded the
next day with Antonica as the continent being East Karana as my spawn, that
day later I got PK'd in High Keep (sullon zek).  Upon loading, or spawning
at bind point, this error occured.  I did check the virtual memory
(pagefile.sys) to find out what was it's max output was, so I bumped it up
(on navy computer) to 1gb.  I know, way overkill. Tried it again, and
nothing.  After about a few hours of thinking and twinking something hit me.
Navy computer doesn't have Velious Expansion installed on it.  And my
character was trying to respawn to it.

So, if you're bound in an area where you don't have the COTS bought
Expansion pack installed on your computer, that's a possibility.  To test my
theory, try creating a character where you're bound in Freeport.  Example,
Human Paladin.  Or if you already have a character that's bound and camped
in Antonica, give them a shot, and see if the game loads fully.
