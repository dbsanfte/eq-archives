I didn't say it wasn't;  I just asked what made you think it's
obviously a dungeon.   /shrug

Steamfont Mountains:
Minotaur Caves (tunnels) filled with Minotaurs (KoS) and has
a boss mob.(Meldrath).  It's well established that indoor/outdoor
isn't a good indication:  KC/Unrest/etc are dungeons but are
outside.   So, Steamfont Mountains is a dungeon.   mmmKay...
