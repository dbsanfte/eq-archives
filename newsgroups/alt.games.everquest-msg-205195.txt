As for the bard haste song - IIRC, Anthem has both ATK and haste on it, and
even if you're chanter or shaman hasted the ATK will still help you.

You also mention that you're MA, gods help you.  :)  Snare is one of the
biggest aggro-producers; keeping the mob snared will help keep it focused on
you, not your casters.  The two slows aren't doing you much good; Largo
isnt' noticably better than what Selo's Chain will do.

When I was MA for a group - around your level - I twisted Amplification,
Selo's Consonant Chain, Jonathan's Whistling Warsong (bear with me), and
Fulfil's Curtailing Chant.  Why JWW?  Because if you're the only melee in
the group, it's better haste and ST than Anthem.  If you're not the only
melee, swap in Anthem - but them why are you MA?  /grin  Remember that
Fulfil's has an MR reducer on it, keeping Fulfil's on a target reduces
resists for your SCC and the caster's magic-based spells.  Have Hymn of
Restoration handy, not only can you regen health on yourself in battle but
group-buffing and group-healing are major taunts too.

Depending on where you're fighting, consider fear-kiting.  Twisting
Angstlich's Appalling Screech, Selo's Consonant Chain, and JWW solo'd my
bard from low-40s to 50 at the Combine Fort skeletons in Dreadlands.  If
you're working somewhere that fearkiting is practical, give it a try.
