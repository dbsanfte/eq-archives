Are you smoking crack?

OEM versions of most hardware are usually identical to retail versions 
except you don't get a box, or the bundled games, or the a color manual, 
and in some cases like P4 CPUs the warranty terms between an OEM and 
Retail (boxed) version are different.

OEM versions are made available to system builders. (ie Companies who 
assemble PCs from parts and then sell... this is anyone from Alienware 
to Dell to the Buck-A-Day company to the local PC shop that will build 
you a PC to your specifications. (This last group will often sell you 
the components separately as well)

Technically I -think- companies aren't supposed to sell the OEM versions 
to the general public, except as part of a system... but *many* *many* 
companies do.

Generally if you are buying a hard drive for example, retail is a total 
waste... what do you need a pretty box, installation video, extra 
screws, and  an installation manual for anyways?? Save $30 bucks and buy 
the oem version which ships in a static bag or rigid plastic shell with 
no frills. (If you need the screws just ask, small computer shops are 
overflowing with tiny screws.)

With video cards retail generally gets you a software dvd player, a few 
games, the installation manual, registration form, and driver disk etc. 

The OEM unit usually is the card in a static bag, maybe a driver disk.

Depending on your interest in the bundled titles (and possibly lack of 
internet access to download drivers) the boxed unit may or may not be a 
good value.
