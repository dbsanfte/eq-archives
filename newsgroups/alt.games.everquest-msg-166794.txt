Not exactly but I see where you're going with this.  Only a government
can truly enact price supports through taxation.  However, a monopoly
in EQ is impossible as near as I can tell.  In this case the seller
has no impetus to sell except for price.  There is no repurcussion
unless the originator has enough of the item to slash prices and
undercut the target.  But even then he can only do it for so long and
the target has no operating costs associated with him.  But that's
unrealistic (imagine that, it's a game).

True, but even though it is valuable, it never seems to be in short
supply...

Sure, and hydrogen as well but but no one I know is buying hydrogen or
sand.
