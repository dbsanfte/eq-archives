A little, perhaps.  A better bet is to turn off all bells & whistles before
a raid.

In the big new Options menu (before you log on) turn off all new character
models and make all changes on the next screen that will speed up the game
(Verant's description of the choices are pretty good).

In the game itself go to Options and turn off particle density.
Then type /showspelleffects off

If it's still bad, kill clipping.  If that's not enough, face away from
everyone if you're a caster (kinda hard if you're a melee :) ).  Perhaps
looking down if you're melee.

If you don't have 512MB RAM in your computer and upgrade to a GeForce2 or
better video card (or some ATI Radeons, I don't know much about them). Do
that first and perhaps you won't have to take all these suggestions.  Most
of the time if I'm getting low FPS during a raid the /showspelleffects off
is enough to fix it.
