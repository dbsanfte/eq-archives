My bazaar trader (who doesn't have tinkering at all) had a skill of 200.
So my brother pulled out one of his characters, and sure enough he
had a skill of 200.  We went to test the theory of it in the PoK making
Fire Water (Gnomish Spirits, Water Flask) trivial of 17.  Out of 6
attempts he made 1.  So it looks that while you can see the trivials it
you are not actually at that skill.
Maybe a bug if you have 0 (or "not able to") in a tradeskill choice?
