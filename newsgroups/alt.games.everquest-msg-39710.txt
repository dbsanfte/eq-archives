Depends on your server.  On Druzzil, the SCH is between 1k-1500; never
bought a HoD.

While it's all nice and impressive to have nice big stabs, don't get caught
up in it.  We do about 30% of our damage from stabs.  The other 70% is more
important.  If you get the chance to have a mid-damage, LOW-delay weapon you
should go for it.

If an SCH (10 dmg) did, say, 400 dmg/min and something else had, say, 7 dmg
but only 15 delay I'd be on it in a flash.  It's ALL about the ratio for us
(especially offhand).

Otherwise, an SCH should see an untwinked rogue till his 40s without much
problem.

I had a great opportunity to buy a Crys Spear (13 dmg, but 30 delay = 9
dmg/sec) for 6K and was allowed to pay on installments.  But if I was asked
to trade it for a trak tooth (10/20=10.5 dmg/sec) I'd go for it.
