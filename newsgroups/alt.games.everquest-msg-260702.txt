You may well be right there. ;)

Honestly, I don't think it would take too many significant changes to fix 
the majority of what's wrong with EQLive. Fact is, it's still as close to 
the winning formula as anyone has been able to come. They really just need 
to step back and take a hard look at the mistakes they've made over the 
last few expansions. I'm just afraid they've got blinders on and will 
continue in a direction that's just not working.
