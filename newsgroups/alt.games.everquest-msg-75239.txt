Go to eqatlas.com and print off the Permafrost map.
Do it now.  No, really -- stop reading this and print
them map.  I mean it.

Now that you have the map, look at the maze-like area
just to the west of Vox's chamber.  See those "X"
marks in little squares?  Those are the pits.  Now
that you know where they are, don't fall in them and
die horribly, like half the other newbies on the raid
are going to do.  If the raid leader declares
that casters must bind in the Buff Hall and rush
back into the fight if they die during battle,
it's even more important to have that map, so
that you can find your way back to the dragon
solo after you respawn (AND WITHOUT FALLING IN
THE PITS!)

Next, gather all the Cold Resist gear you can
get your hands on.  Borrow some if you have to.
Vox's AoE cold blast is the biggest killer, and
every CR point you have will help lessen the hits
you take from her, and allow you to live longer.
Magic Resist is nice too if you can get it (it
prevents her from Fearing you repeatedly), but
is less critical (especially for a "support" class
like a Cleric) than is Cold Resist.  And no,
even 120+ Cold Resist at your level is not too
much.  In fact, it's barely enough.  Put on
CR gear even at the expense of AC and/or WIS/Mana
gear, because a) Vox will spend much more time
nuking you than actually hitting you, and b)
without good CR protection you'll die before
you go OOM anyway.

Most of the rest will be explained to you by the
raid leader(s) after you arrive, so just do
whatever they tell you.  But the above two
items (i.e., bring a map, and bring CR gear)
you'd only learn too late if you just went to
the raid without advance warning.

One fun tip -- if you set up a hotkey that
says:

  /target lady_vox
  /assist

You can use it to set your target to whomever
Vox is trying to eat at the moment.  It'll help
you target and heal the person who most needs
it at the moment.
