Blind? How long of a break did you take? Are you referring to the old
bit where you have to stare into your book to med? That changed a long
time ago. If its just having to sit on your butt all the time, yeah -
that does get tedious. SOE has tried to rectify this by giving Clerics
new combat skills and a new summoned hammer that is desirable. Im not
so sure if this has brought new excitement to your average cleric post
55 tho.

Huh? Oh here we go again. You are in favor of capitalism, but you want
it all for free? That simply doesnt make sense. It takes capital to
create these new zones. In order for SOE to continue providing
everquest, they must make a profit. If you think the monthly
subscription cost could cover all that, do you know how much it costs
to upkeep thousands of servers (yes, an EQ server is not just one
computer)? Yes, I agree to some extent that they are milking the
franchise (especially in the idiodic name changing and character
transfer services), but charging for expansions is not unwarrented.

Look at it this way. The more everquest is successful, the more
choices we will have in the future. EQ is one of the most successful
MMORPG going (by all counts that ive heard). If EQ had flopped or was
struggling to make a profit, would other companies be so eager to test
the market? EQ's success only paves the way for bigger and better on
line games in the future.
