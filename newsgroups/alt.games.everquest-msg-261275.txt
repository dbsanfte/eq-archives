<top post corrected>

Lots of people have issues with a wide variety of configurations, 
including various NVidia based cards, and various ATI based cards.

I used to be firmly in the NVidia camp, but, my last purchase was an ATI.  
The card is awesome, far better performance for the price than I got out 
of any NVidia card I owned.  I could not get that performance from an 
NVidia unless I wanted to spend at least half again as much money.
