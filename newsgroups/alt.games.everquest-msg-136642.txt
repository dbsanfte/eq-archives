Well, a friend of mine just lef the game, and now I have his account with a
53 Cleric.  I would like to know a good plan for getting to know the class.
It will be tough to solo him for exp, so maybe I should jst practice by
PL'ing my 37 Wiz, 22 Monk, 23 War?

I just don't want to get invited to a group or worse yet, a PoH raid and get
em all killed.

Thoughts?

Peace,
Xytrex
