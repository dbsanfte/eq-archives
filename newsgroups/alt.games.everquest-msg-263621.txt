Acutally with our tiered tax system, he does not pay 28%, assuming a 
taxable income (after deductions) of $100k, the federal tax for:

Single - $22746 (22.7%)
Married filing jointly - $18620 (18.6%)
Married filing seperately - $23722.75 (23.7%)
Head of household  - $20747.50 (20.7%)

Now, if the $100k is before deductions, that amount goes down rapidly, as 
it affects the top tax bracket portion of your income tax first, so for 
every $1 deducted for all but married, you deduct 28 cents from your tax 
to a point, for married filing seperately, it's 33 cents, and for married 
filing jointly, it's 25 cents.  As your income is reduced, you will drop 
down to the next tax bracket, and additional deductions will affect your 
tax less.  (Tax tiers are 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35% for last year)  
The point at which those tiers is reached varies depending on your filing 
status.
