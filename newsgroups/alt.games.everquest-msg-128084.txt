I wasn't hunting for spider silks, I was hunting spiderling silks 
because when I mentioned to a groupmate that it was tough fighting when 
people six levels lower than you were outdamaging you (twinks! BAH!), 
and mentioned that just ONE WEAPON this other rogue had was 500PP, which 
was a sum I'd never seen yet in my lifetime.  The groupmate said 
something like oh, it's EASY to make that much!  Just go farm spiderling 
silks in Feerrott, it's got great drop rates, 8 per spider (I was 
getting 1-2 if I was *lucky*, 0 mostly, occasionally a spider leg), and 
then go sell them in EC, you'll be rich in no time!

May I just say.... hah.
