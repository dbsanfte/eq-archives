... a completely inaccurate statement at best.  Bin Laden was known
during the Mujahedeen uprising against the Soviets and was considered
to be a whack job by the US even then.  The US funded the Mujahedeen
by proxy, but not Bin Laden directly - something that seems to be
frequently confused by some people.

Bin Laden used his own money to fund his projects, most of which
involved non-military operations in Afghanistan. He was known mostly
for his moneybags capabilitiy; his reputation as a warrior is largely
mythic.  He returned to Saudi Arabia after the war and was invited to
leave by the Saudis after he tried to instigate an uprising there.  He
decamped to Sudan where he spent a lot of time and money building his
construction business and forming Al Qaeda. 

In 1996, the Sudanese government offered to arrest Bin Laden - an
offer the US government declined.  They then expelled Bin Laden who
relocated back to Afghanistan where he had a strong network from his
previous funding of the Madrasos in Pakistan.
