	Um, hate to tell you this, but unless you're in a guild or otherwise have
an established network of players to collaborate with, Karnor's and Seb are
pretty much it for the endgame.  Velketor's is coming on strong now that
Verant has turned the difficulty down and loot up...twice.

	Everywhere else is BYOG -- Bring Your Own Group.  You can't zone into
Chardok, or Charisis, or Kael or Siren's and go LFG.
