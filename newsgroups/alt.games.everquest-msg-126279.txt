I believe that it is largely determined by your level vs the mobs level, and
the mobs appropriate resistance.  There may very well be other factors such
as the level of the spell, but I think that is a minor component of the
formula if so.  Of course, I could be completely wrong too, I generally use
my latest spells on mobs, so have not had much opportunity to test this
theory.
