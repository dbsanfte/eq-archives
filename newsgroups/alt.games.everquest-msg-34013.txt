Oh, I see. You have no taste.

I'm guessing the one who got most heals was the one who needed most
heals, eh? And look who's the lightskin mule now...
I don't have to say a single word to them, they run up to me while I
am in combat and heal and buff me. Heck, I don't even have to go
looking for things to kill, I'm a kodiak magnet (or so it seemed last
night. First snow griffons everywhere for my main and then young
kodiaks everywhere for my alt...)

Hehe. Existential crisis as in declining member count and not getting
enough of the roleplay angle they want, like wars with good guilds and
stuff.

Walrus tooth is fine, my warrior has one. What I did with my twinks
was to get them a weapon in each skill and have them start out using
only the weapons with least damage, practicing harder hitting stuff
when they found mobs that wouldn't drop quite as fast as orc pawns do.
My warrior, at 9, still hasn't worked much on twohanded weapons, and
my shadow knight started out with a 5/24 fine steel scimitar before
getting her 8/28 whip around level 5 for 1hs.
