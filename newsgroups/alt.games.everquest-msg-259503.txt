Your intentions sound good... but you forgot one thing which could have
saved a lot of trouble.

/say You ok?

Only takes a second to ask and get it answered, and you would have found out
if he had it well in hand or not.   If he was prepared and everything was
rooted and tied down, then he could have been just fine, and you might have
wasted his rooting and debuffing mana, etc by killing his second target
before he could.

I always ask, unless the situation is extremely obvious...   like the person
is well below half life and getting beat on by 3 mobs as he runs away from
them.
