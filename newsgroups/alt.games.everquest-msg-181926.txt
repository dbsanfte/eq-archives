I'm pretty sure I've read of a quest involving him (DE/Rogue maybe?
can't recall).  He must agro/be agro'd by something along his usual
path that kills him (or maybe he wanders off under the world or
something), I used to spend a fair amount of time in NRo and never
once saw him (I read somewhere he's a one week spawn, but obviously
I've never verified that).

I've never seen Terrorantula, but I saw Terrorantula's corpse quite
a few times before the Erudite racial tailoring(?)/smithing(?)
recipes (or quests? dunno, never played an Erudite) were added.
