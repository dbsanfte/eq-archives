I don't think that's provable, really.  There are kiting junkies out 
there, surely.  It would be a hard study to construct.  If we expose 
personalities manfesting the same degree of addictiveness to EQ and to 
kiting, assuming they both have the same degree of basic interest in the 
hobby we've selected for them, which of them will still be EQ'ing/kiting 5 
years later, and which will be devoting more hours per week to the 
activity?  Including designing new kites, shopping online for the ultimate 
string, etc... :)

I'd say it's a tough call.  Personally, I've never really seen the thrill 
of kite flying.  But there are those who quite like it.  But your 
statement above sounds to me about like 'fruit lovers are more likely to 
eat apples than oranges'.  It could be true, but it might have as much to 
do with which is in season as with their inherent degree of citrusness.

Thre's a decent writeup on that here:
