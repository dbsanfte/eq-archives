}So? What was the other offence? Breaking game rules is still breaking the
}rules, what difference does it make if they broke different rules?

First, it's my understanding that they had previous warnings, not 
suspensions, but I could be wrong on that.  Second, it's my understanding 
that Verant's policies say a person will be suspended/banned only if they 
have a previous warning for the _same_ offense.  So by justifying the 
bannings with a warning for a _different_ offense, Verant is breaking 
their own rules.  

So, shall we give Verant a warning, or just ban them outright?

}Bottom line is Conquest knew what they were doing was against the rules.
}They still did it, they got punished. The game is better for it.

Bottom line remaining to be proven.  Especially the 'they knew' part, I 
have considerable doubt about.  And if you re-post that guildchat log 
again, I'll ignore it, I've already expressed my views on that one. :)
