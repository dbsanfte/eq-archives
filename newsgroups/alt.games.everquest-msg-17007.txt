A friend and I were discussing the possible reasons for why there isn't much
role playing, now, not to open up an "old" thread, but aside from your usual
'I wanna win' players we figured a lot has to do with the fact that some
people just don't know how to type.  I am not talking the "spelling/slang"
stuff but honestly can't "pluck and peck" fast enough to maintain a ongoing
in character dialog.  The only reasons why we think this is so, is mainy of
my friends who play EQ and who took typing in school can look at the screen,
respond quickly to what is being said and type what emote or comments they
want.  When my husband plays he is always looking at the key board if he
wants to have a conversation within our guild and misses "tells" from others
due to this and has to cut back on his RP or regular chat.

So what do you think?  A possible explination?  Though i am not saying all
people need to type to be an effective role player, but i think it may
explain a few.
