After more than 5 years, it's time to move on. Past time actually but
friends are still playing and I enjoy their company so I still log in
for some groups that we have scheduled every week. I doubt anyone in
my regular group will still be playing EQ by next year, none of us are
raiders and all of us are pretty disenchanted with the current state
of EQ for grouping players. It went from a group of players that had
pre-ordered (and looked forward to) every expansion so far to a group
where nobody's pre-ordered OoW. 

Probably just burnout but I no longer care enough to bother with
spending time to do flag camps just to access the content in a new
expansion, Between that and the fact that raiding bores me to tears,
high end EQ is dead for me and I'll be moving on. 

Rgds, Frank
