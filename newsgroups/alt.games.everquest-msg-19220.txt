Druid in cheap heavy metal? Bone arm and legplates and chitin armor
are the only things available with metal look for druids before going
uber :)
The first time I played, I was dressed in full patchwork in my mid
teens and had to scrounge for money for a magic weapon. I am now
middle class: I have acceptable gear for my level, but several items
are gifts from wealthier friends which I am honor bound to return
if/when I get better items in their slots. I had one twink from my
first trip to level 39 and now have two more twinks, partially because
buying twink gear is so much cheaper than my own upgrades. I've now
stopped twinking with the cash on my main in order to save up for her
upgrades, as my playing hours and ISP are not too camp friendly.
Speaking of camps,  they _can_ be the fastest way to make money, but
they're unreliable income sources, depending on 1. item drop 2. you
winning roll 3. you being able to use/sell item. At 42, I can make 50
pp or more in a 3 hour session in a good group in a poor area like DL
if I loot a reasonable share of mobs. I also get money from porting
for donations.
I have a friend who is a self-made man without camping everything in
sight; instead, he spent three months trading in EC instead of hunting
and made a fortune through his good EQ business sense.
