About 35-40 :)

Nasty stuff in there at night.

Run through there in the day, run through the commons and get a bind in
Freeport, then hunt bears and stuff in EC, or get in an orc-camp group.

Well, its a better weapon, and you'll need something magic in order to
hunt wisps in a couple of levels, and ghouls after that, since these
mobs are immune to non-magic weapons. 20pp is a bit steep though. Velium
weapons are very common in Velious, dropping like fine steel does in the
old world. Most of it ends up being dumped at vendors for 5pp or so - if
you can find anyone who has bothered to lug anything as heavy as a bunch
of Velium weapons back to Antonica to sell in EC or wherever, I'm sure
they'd be happy to take anything more than they'd get from a merchant,
or maybe just give it to you. Try '/auc WTB a magic weapon for a lowbie
rogue who needs it to kill wisps etc - I can afford up to x pp', and I'm
sure someone will just give you one, since you don't look like a beggar
that way. 10pp or so is a common asking price for regular velium weapons
though.

They are junk to people high enough to use the proc (12pt DD spell that
won't go off until you hit level 25, by which time 12pts of damage will
barely scratch anything you're fighting), and so are just vendor/newbie
fodder to anyone of a sufficient level to get them.
