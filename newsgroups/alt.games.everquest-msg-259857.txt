I think you miss my point.

I was advised to play at LEAST 4 hours a day, as you can see from the 
part I quoted.

What I was asking was, if for RL reasons I'm only able to play 3 hours 
in one day, would playing 5 hours the next day make up for it?

So your response makes no sense.

What you -should- have said is "no, then you might find yourself playing 
2 hours one day (planning to make it up by playing 6+ the next of 
course) or even 1 hour (and the obligatory 7+ next day)"

Of course you might be trying to suggest that the OP meant to say "at 
most" instead of "at least" but my experience with EQ suggests that "at 
most" 4 hours wouldn't even get you a half decent shot at stormfeather!

Grage :)
