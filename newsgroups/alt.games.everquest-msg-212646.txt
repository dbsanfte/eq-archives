If you buy your dots from the merchant in the Bazaar, 104 is good enough for
CHA.  That's the magic number that gets you the best pricing for a given
merchant if you are indifferent or better.  132 gets you that price even at
apprehensive.  (And 93 is good enough at the merchants in your class guild
in your hometown).

There are also a handful of merchants that have special "screw you" pricing,
such as Boomba the Big in Freeport.  Avoid them.

Finally, a given merchant's prices change occasionally.  I've bought from a
merchant, and then bought more of the same a few minutes later, and got a
different price.  Some people say that this has to do with popularity...a
merchant that gets a lot of traffic raises prices, and indeed, it was
merchants near a bank (the nearest food/drink merchants to the Neriak bank)
where I saw this.  On the other hand, I've never seen the prices change at
the Bazaar merchants I usually deal with, so maybe only some merchants are
set to do this?  Anyway, according to eqtraders, this effect can be
countered by higher CHA, with 134 being needed sometimes to get particular
merchants down to their normal 104 CHA price.

A simple way to check is to offer to sell a dot to the merchant.  If the
merchant offers 9p 5g 2s 4c, then you've got enough faction and CHA to get
the best possible pricing.  Just check with a dot (or some other item you
always have and know the best price on) before doing any buying or selling,
to make sure nothing funny is going on.

As far as what CHA gear to buy, start with a pair of Opal Encrusted Steins.
You can pick them up for 10-40p each in the Bazaar, and they give +25 CHA
each.  That's +50 CHA, and is enough to get most people past 104 right
there.
