Just a note on EQWindows.  There is a bug in the latest version that when you 
open a session it also opens a 2nd tiny window in the upper left corner of 
your screen.  This window uses up system resources and makes EQ run as though 
2 copies are open.  After you have your session loaded up minimize out of EQW 
and close this phantom window.
