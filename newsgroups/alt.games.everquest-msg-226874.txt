I dunno...having the best melee DPS in the game isn't exactly something to
be scoffed at, especially when the latest content has focused on DPS,
DPS, DPS!  From the parses I have seen, they really do have a lead on
everyone else by a healthy margin.

With the new skills being added in a few weeks, they'll also have a whole
kiddie-bag of neat tricks to pay with (snare, slow, self-haste, dots,
lifetaps, guarenteed max damage, etc).  

Besides, I'm too busy feeling sorry for my own class *snicker* I almost
hope they give the new +END buffs to hybrids so we can stick out our
tongue at the pure melee who ask for them and say "huh, guess I never
bought that spell".  I swear, it'd be like giving brand new cars to the
Jones' kids and them asking the Petersons' kids to wash/wax/polish them
for them.  You want a glass of w(h)ine with that, massah?
