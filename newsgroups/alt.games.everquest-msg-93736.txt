Posting on top is fine. Most all other NGs do it in such manner. Though I
respect the fact that people like it on bottom. I will also point out that
many that have been in Newsgroups since 1986, learn to keep up and develop
good comprehension skills. They want it fast and do not have the need to
re-read the same crap on every reply. Others just simply have the attention
span of a rock and need to read it again and again I guess.

 I'm posting on top until the time comes that the complainer pay's for my
ISP. Then and only then will I listen to his crying, or conform to make it
easy on him/her. Now if someone sent me an email requesting such a posting
etiquette, I would probably oblige. But to take a public stance to prove
ones control over others is kinda ridiculous and earns retaliation.
 You get outta NGs what you put into them. But for far too many, the NG is
real and the people are all honest, all make over 200k, and all have
Ferraris and Lamborghini's.
Don't get suckered cause they actually start believing the BS the talk.
