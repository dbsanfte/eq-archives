I don't mind having a mezzer but in my opinion, no one class is
absolutely necessary as long as everyone does their job well.  Mezzing
can be nice if the puller happens to get too many mobs, unless of
course your puller can FD and make the mobs go away again...but it has
to be done carefully to ensure that there's always something waiting
to be killed.  Mezzing a whole room full of mobs to pull them one at a
time is bound to ensure that you run out of time before you finish the
adventure.
