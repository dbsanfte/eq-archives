I actually find quite a bit of skill in EverQuest.

Communication skills. You need to let your group members know what you
have coming in for mobs. I usually have 1 hot key inc {%t} and then if
I have more then 1 mob coming in... x2, x4, x5 and so on... .this lets
the crowd control people know that they better get off their duff and
be ready. 

Diplomacy skills. Anyone who's been a guild leader or guild officer
knows about these kinds of things. Granted there are some that just
say STFU, but the majority i have come across will actually deal with
a situation that arises. 

Martial Arts.... plain and simple... it takes a lot of skill to be
aware of how close that frying pan is to coming in contact with your
head when the wife is scowling at you, ready to attack.
