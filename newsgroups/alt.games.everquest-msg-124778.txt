That depends on what you call "camping" Ragefire.  No one is going
to care if you're calling a cleric who's been camped there for 40
hours or not;  you're either ready before someone else or you're
not.  Sure, *most* guilds will step aside IF you have close to a
kill group there (and they can see that you're about ready to pull)
but no one can reasonably be expected to step aside just because
a cleric has been sitting there with one group (or two) that's NOT
capable of killing Ragefire.  And they shouldn't be expected to step
aside either, IMO.

Sitting there with one group isn't "camping" Ragefire.  Sitting
there with a kill group isn't either, IMO.  That's simply FCFS.
How do you camp something that's a rare spawn without any sort
of a normal placeholder?  It's not like you kill the wurm that
spawns there every 28 minutes until he spawns.

Let's put it this way:  another guild was going to contest the
same spawn.  They have enough of a team in place to kill a few
things and watch the spawn point;  say four people.  The rest
of their guild is either bound there or logged there, same as
you.  Ragefire spawns, they log in and/or Gate there, and are
ready to pull before your other people get there.  Who's got the
right to the spawn?

Simple:  *they* do.  They were ready first with a kill-capable
team.  So you either have a kill-capable team there FIRST (as
in FCFS) or all your effort is wasted, right?  That's FCFS not
"camping."
