I heard of some supposed theory that if you go within aggro range of a
KOS mob and stand there, it won't attack you right away, but that if
you /con it, doing the /con command will get its attention and it will
start attacking you.  Some people swear this is true; others think
it's just hogwash and that the mob would have started attacking you
eventually anyway whether you /conned it or not.  Has anybody here had
any first-hand experiences with /con pulling and whether it actually
works?

Thanks in advance,
