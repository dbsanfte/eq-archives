Lol, your responses are getting even funnier!

TRY READING THE FUCKING DOCUMENTATION THAT CAME WITH THE GAME!!!

If you *had* done so, you would see that you can do all these things you're
complaining that you can't do.  There is also a help file in the game that
can answer most questions.

Funny, I can't change my hair color in most games I play.  Doesn't mean they
suck.
