Because they have different contexts and meanings. Thats the nature
of language. Whats the difference between love and affection? Language
is about conveying intent, emotional attitude, context, as much as possible,
not just empirical information. Sure "Fuck" may refer to the same act as
"Make Love" but they have very different connotations about attitudes
involved, etc, and where the connotations are less distinct they are still
*there*. Thats why the words remain... they're not really exact synonyms.

I was thinking about this while bored on the commute home yesterday too. I
wondered if maybe kids start to swear cause its the only way people will
pay attention to them ("Just a kid, safe to ignore.") and grow out of it
once they start to get attention and respect as a matter of course.

Well, I'd agree no word is inherently vile or evil, but some words are 
inherently offensive. Thats the point of them. Its their primary use. And which
words are offensive vary by culture. It doesnt seem a huge burden to me
to accept some people have different cultural values from you and avoid
a priori offending/excluding them from a community they might make valuable
and entertaining members of.

If thats too much effort for folks, well, theres nothing I can do about it,
and yeah, I agree the "what about the kiddeees" argument is hookey, but
regardless, I dont think that affects my core point. Theres a reason we dont
all talk in purely scientific terms - theres a lot more to language than
that.
