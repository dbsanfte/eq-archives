Went on a fun raid on Mistmoore at 30.  BUT....we had enough for 4 
groups and most of the people on the raid had higher level mains. 
Experience really made a difference there because they knew where the 
mobs were and how to get everyone in the castle and back out safely. 
So...if you have a raid leader who is familiar with the place Mistmoore 
is good for mid 30s.

There's also SolA.  Know there were a few things I needed from there 
that would have been alot easier with a raid.
