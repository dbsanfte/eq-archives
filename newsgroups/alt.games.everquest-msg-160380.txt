I dont have any of hte expansions and ive tried it..
it does NOTHING.

you see everyone else port away and NOTHING happens to you.
It does not try to port you, and it does not put you in a safe zone, and you
get no error message.

Now, once my group, group teleported to an expansion place, and that time it
put me in a safe-spot in the zone i was in.
