To quote you, dumbshit:

"Sergey thinks (correctly) that Sword is a trollish imbecile. Sergey does
not want to ever group with Sword. You somehow get the idea from the
sentence (helpfully quoted at the bottom) that Sergey is afraid of Sword.
You are wrong. You cannot comprehend simple english sentences. Sergey is
better at understanding written english, AND HE DOESN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE"

If you have something to say to me, Frisch, then by all means, take your
best shot, junior.  Like I said, I don't give a rat's ass what Sergey thinks
of me.  Hell, I could give a rat's ass less what <you> thought of me.  I
know it bugs you that I think you're a blithering idiot though.  I hope it
bugs you knowing that I find anyone who supports  your cause an ass-kissing
buffoon.  You pull the same shit Zeppo pulls, yet your little ISP account is
safe and sound because none of the spineless wimps around here will report
you.  Oh, don't think for one hot second that I'm going to do it, Frisch.
I'm waiting on you to read one of my posts and keel over when that vein in
your neck explodes.

Now get bent, Gomer.

Sword
