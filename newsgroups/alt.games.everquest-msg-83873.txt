    Hey, they die a lot, you die a lot. It works out! :-)

    If they were serious about getting bard NPCs to act a bit more, well,
bardly, they should create the base characteristics of the mob as if it
wasn't a bard, then raise those stats as if it was singing a few appropriate
combat self-buff songs. Add in some ungodly movement rate, and you have a
more realistic bard NPC.
