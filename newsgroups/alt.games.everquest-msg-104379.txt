People of Norrath, your attention please...

This is the lead server GM of Verant Interactive. As you will no doubt be 
aware, the plans for development of new high-level Everquest content 
require the building of a transplanar express route to the Planes of Power 
through your plane of existence, and regrettably Norrath is one of the 
planets scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less that 
two of your Norrathian minutes. Thank you.

There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts 
and demolition orders have been on display in the file cabinet in Sanctus 
Seru for fifty of your Norrathian years, so you've had plenty of time to 
lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss 
about it now.
