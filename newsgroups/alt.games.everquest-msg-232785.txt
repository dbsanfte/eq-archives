I personally use: Defenders Lightblade and Axe of the Scions.

Has been a good combination for me.  Would still like to see more then what
I hit for, but wouldn't we all. Funny thing is tho, not sure if it is the
speed at which I attack with them or what, but I have pulled agro from a 58
Warrior and a 57 Paly so much and so often in LDoN and the rest of the game.
And thats with out me taunting. Still trying to figure out how I do that.
*shrugs* One of lifes mysteries on me I guess.
