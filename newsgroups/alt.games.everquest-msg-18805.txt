As far as I know, no trivials have been found yet for cultural armor.  The 
enchanted-imbued versions have been confirmed to be non-trivial by the few 
blacksmiths at 250 (the maximum level for blacksmithing or any other 
tradeskill).  It's all but certain the enchanted versions and imbued 
versions would be nontriv at 250 too.  Possibly some of the plain cultural 
armor might have trivs less than 251 but nobody has posted having found any 
yet - primarily because getting the ingredients for cultural are so hard 
and/or so expensive that you don't waste them on non-imbued non-enchanted 
items.

In other words, for most intents and purposes, cultural armor is all 250+.  
I'm at 187 in blacksmithing right now and I'm not even considering going 
for cultural yet.  The failure rates just on fine steel are hard enough on 
the pocketbook.
