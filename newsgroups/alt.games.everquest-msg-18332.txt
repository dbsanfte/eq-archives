Hanging out near the newbie log in Nek farming bonechips, I like to cast
Voicegraft and sit my pet up on the newbie log "/pet guard here" and sit
over by a tree or something where I can see them and hear what's going on.
I'll start making dumb comments about being hungry and needing pp for my new
spells...it's pretty funny watching the poor noobs handing my pet food and
money...one guy got really mad at my pet because he said "I know you're
really a high lvl character...you shouldn't be here begging for
things...that's not right...you should be helping us all out by buffing us"

I was laughing so hard at the thought of "/petition Kabab is harrassing us
newbies at the log, make him stop!!!"
