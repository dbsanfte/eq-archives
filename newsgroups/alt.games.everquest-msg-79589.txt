The sword was too powerful for the risk...it should have been no drop, the
majority of people that were getting them were selling on and just using the
quest to farm the item. At one point the sword was as little as 3k there
were so many of them about for sale.
Now the drop is a Scimitar, it is no drop and is 11/29 +5magic dam instead
of 16/29 +5 magic
also gives less AC...new I should have bought one when they were cheap...nm,
was after Armour at the time.
