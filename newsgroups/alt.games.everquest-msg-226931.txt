I somewhat disagree....if it was not for NBG in groups (and mybe that I am a
girl??) I would probably seriously under equiped. I have found it extreemly
difficult getting ornate items because for the first time on our server
everyone rolls because they sell for so much. I would prefer to be in NGB
group anyday so that if the plate drops I know there will only be 2-3 of us
rolling for it, not everyone.

That said, I does get a little annoying getting in a group with players who
are totally under-equipped, and really have no excuse (except maybe greed?)
to be wearing the bad gear and get the good drops every time because of
this.

Aaaaanyway. I prefer NGB most times and will happily support it, though I
will not moan and complain if a majority want to roll for drops.

And of course everyone is allowed their own opinions and it was good to hear
from the non-NBG supporters for a change :)
