Hehe, according to all of EQtraders, and my experience in tailoring 
youre wrong. Large kits were 8 slots, then became 10 slots in 1 patch, 8 
slots again in the next, and existing Large ones became 10 slot Deluxe ones.
The "DNC and eat stuff" problem were for ALL back with a combine button, 
including the Deluxe ones, untill they fixed it for all bags in a patch.
