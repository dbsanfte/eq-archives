I won't disagree.  Have they ever made a change to pathing or aggro without
getting any bitching?  :P

With more experience you'd be able to tell most of those things at
first glance.  With a little more experience still you'd be able to adjust
mid-pull to deal with what you weren't able to tell at first glance.

Sorry, the system isn't *that* complex, particularly in LDoN (even on hard
there isn't much complexity, the mobs just hit like mack trucks).

I won't say it can't happen.  We all know how good (read: nonexistent)
Sony's testing is.  I've never had a collection mission that wasn't able to
be completed, and true to my philosophy I don't generally stand around for
half an hour trying to get a non-collection mission (though I do admit that
I tend to try once for a different one, because collection missions *do*
take the most time to complete).

Ahh, you're one of those clerics that think they are god.  That explains a
lot, those are usually the absolute worst clerics in my experience.  Mostly
because they never learn *anything* because they're too busy complaining
whenever anything comes up that they might be able to learn from.

He does?  Better than someone who has played the game since release in 1999,
has multiple level 65 characters, is in elemental planes, is lead puller in
said elemental level guild, has been an officer in said guild and its
predecessor guilds since 1999 as well?  Damn, that cleric must have some
pretty amazing qualifications, as I don't run into too many people more
experienced than me in this game.  :)

No, I mean figure out that there is a game past Vindi.

Doing it all the time is silly.  There is added risk if the cleric sits down
right after landing a 6k heal that I hope you're aware of.  You think I play
with needless risk?  I don't try to suicide my cleric when there isn't any
call for doing so.  Sitting down right after a heal to catch a tick is for
emergency use, it's not the best way to play a cleric regularly.

Drop the celest first, sit and catch a tick or three while that works with
no fear of pulling aggro, then CH after the fight.  Think about that for a
little while...

A CH is a CH, whether it heals 2k or 7k.

And how much does virtue cost you at level 50?

I definitely can be.  It tends to show up most when people argue for NBG or
needless caution outside of a raid (or even needless caution on a raid,
for that matter, though not a subject often brought up in my guild).

I'm babbling about the mobs in LDoN that quad for 2k's, much like you were
babbling about the 100% MR mobs you're running into in LDoN.  I'm glad you
recognized it as babbling, and I hope you take the point from that.  :)

Right, the 10 minutes that the magician's sow lasts after everyone else's
wears off the 1 time out of 100 that it will work out that way, or when the
magician is slumming someplace they could be soloing.  Gotcha.  Feel free to
level up a magician and apply to a guild and be sure and explain how good of
a puller you are...

Yeah...   so why are you so insistent on having z*3?

You can "catch a tick" while getting sit aggro and never get hit if you
absolutely have to.  That's when the body language *really* gets noticeable.

And when the lead cleric sends you a tell explaining some of the things you
are doing wrong that need improved and you respond with "Yeah, whatever"
you'll be lucky to still be in the guild the next day.  :P

In which case the mobs are correspondingly a helluva lot easier.  It's about
mob DPS at that point, which is actually pretty linear in LDoN from what
I've seen comparing my experience at 65 and at 51 (unlike a lot of the rest
of EQ, particularly PoP).

I will admit that I started "playing" my cleric at about 58.  Before then he
was pure PL to catch up to the point where I actually could "play" him (not
sure he qualifies as ever actually being played, as he's never my main
focus).  If I were to try playing a cleric in the low-50s, I'd have a
learning curve as I figured out my mana pool and spell selection and the
hitpoints of the people around me.  But once I figured that out, then I'd be
ready to "play hard" again.  :)
