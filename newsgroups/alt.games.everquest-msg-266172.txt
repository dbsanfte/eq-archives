It's true, there is no shortage of immature sniping on both forums, no one's 
got a monopoly on that. But having visited both forums, played both games to 
a limited degree, and generally experienced both the Blizzard batttle.net 
and original EQ audiences extensively over the last 5-7 years, there's no 
question in my mind which audience I will prefer gaming with day in and day 
out. For me, the two big tie-breakers in what I felt was a very tough 
decision between these two very appealing titles was a) the content, and b) 
the playerbase.
