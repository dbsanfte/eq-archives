The way you suggest to do it seems to be universally accepted.  It happened 
to us 2 nights ago in DSP - a Frog Paladin wanted to know if he could 
practice weapons on our mobs.  Heck yeah froggy, add some extra damage and 
not take our EXP - I'm all over that.  Except in specialized situations, 
people won't mind you doing it.
