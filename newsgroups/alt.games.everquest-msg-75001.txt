Your meditation skill will only increase if you are actively regaining mana,
when you mana bar is full, you will no longer be using your meditation
skill. If you want it to go up quickly, just cast until you are oom, med to
full, rince and repeat. But the skill really does raise quickly enough in
normal use anyway.
