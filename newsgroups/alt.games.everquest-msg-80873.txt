hehe, sorry to sound cocky about it.

Bear in mind the frame of reference I'm using. nToV cleared in a day.
4th warder dropped, Yelinak, Grieg and Overfiend regular targets. That's
given us a lot of experience with ubermobs, as well as strengthened our
raiding force with their drops considerably

We have had almost exclusive access to nToV for months. We have almost
everyone who wants it with Sleepers loot. Everyone is L60 with AA
skills. We had only 1 or 2 GB as a result of being pro-gaint faction
throughout Velious. We do have a lot of rogues and warriors, and top out
at around 80 people for the biggest raids with up to a dozen each of
rogues, warriors and clerics max.

I notice you only said you had 20 L60s and mostly skyshrine armour. That
is a big difference, and I'm sure once you're all L60 you'll mow through
him too. I was at 6100hps with group aego/focus/ds and stam alone for
AoW if that's any indication, though I did take an AC hit to get there.
If you can keep the MA up, and keep everyone else agro-free, you've
solved the first half of the fight. All you then need is enough damage
output to drop whatever mob before clerics get LoM.
