It all depends on the way you say it to a gm and the particular gm you get.
My main's name is Kaziganthi de'Orilg. They tried to send me to read it and
I had before I petitioned for it. I knew they would say I couldn't have it.
Well this is a roleplaying game right? Well Orilg is my clan (iksar
warrior), and de'Orilg is a family honorific of Orilg (hence of the family
Orilg) since I am technically the only one from my clan playing (hehe). To
deny me the last name, the gms were inhibiting my roleplaying ability. After
about 3 tells this way and that, the gm gave in. It may have been I made a
vaild BS reason (which is why I wanted it anyway, though it does sound like
BS), or it could have been that this gm had no backbone to say no too many
times. So in some cases the "roleplaying" aspect can do you justice hehe.
