I'm gonna have to disagree with that Sean.  My Paladin hasn't had an
InstantFade[tm] of an Invis to Undead since around the time his
Divinition reached 200.  And the frequency of early Invis fades has
declined noticeably for all of my characters with some version of the
spell as their Divination skill climbed.  A L20 Druid with a 40
Divination skill sees a lot more early fades of Camoflauge than a 20
Druid with a 105 skill, or at least that's been my experience.  High
skill doesn't eliminate early Invis breaks, but it sure as hell seems
to reduce their frequency.
