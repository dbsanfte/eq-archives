Shadowbane has it in the works. I don't know if its live yet. But it'll 
be an in game thing I hear.

Anarchy Online its rumored supports it too, for free.

Several other titles simply say no (which I think is a 'good thing'). No 
charges of profiteering there.

More relevantly, few (if any other) game has stuff that's quite as 
difficult to replace. You can always just start up a new character on 
another server... it doesn't take 3 years of begging for raids on 
particular mobs to gear up....

SoE is only one or two short steps from opening their own plat and items 
'online store' at this point.


  The only other one I play is DAoC, and as

DAoC is one of the games where I was under the impression it wasn't hard 
to level up to max in a short period of time. You really don't 'lose' 
that much on a reroll.
