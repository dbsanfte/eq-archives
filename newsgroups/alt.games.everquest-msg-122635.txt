The best way to find a guild: write down the names of the guilds of the
folks you group with. The folks you think are decent people. Any friends you
may have made. Ask them where their guild's website is. Ask what their guild
policies are.

If all else fails, go to the Xev server message board, and post there.
http://pub12.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards They have a section called
"Looking for a guild."

Do research on the guilds available to you, and see if they will fit your
play style and personality before you join.
