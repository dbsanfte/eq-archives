As a newbie EQ1 player (started November 2004), I can't answer a lot of
this.  However, there are a lot of players at all levels on the Bristlebane
server (that's the only server I play on).  I've also run into players that
are even newer to EQ1 than I am.

I just got OoW and DoN but I'm nowhere near being able to "use" them yet.
At this point I have no desire to get involved in EQ2.  I'm thoroughly
enjoying EQ1 and hope it sticks around long enough for me to really get into
it.
