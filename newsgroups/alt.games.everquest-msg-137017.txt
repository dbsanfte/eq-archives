Ah the record. Let me use my version which is the RECORD. Anyone here
can reconstruct my record. Put up or shut up you whacko.

Easily determined from the RECORD (GOOGLE.COM) you just started
posting on the 29th. Lets bring up your posting email on whois which
is a public RECORD(http://www.netsol.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois).
I did in a different thread. Let me repeat myself, for the RECORD. 

Note the RECORD (WHOIS) shows that you updated this recently. 30th
July. The whois looks like you are a one-man show. Bored by the summer
slowdown in a town like Mequon. The RECORD (MAPQUEST.COM) shows that
this is a suburb of Milwaukee. I can get you a satellite map too.

I am sorry, I never knew SOE has a branch office in Milwaukee. Now the
RECORD (YAHOO.COM) shows there is a Sony Outlet in Kenosha, WI.  Under
computer Graphics for your town the RECORD (YAHOO.COM) shows there are
no big players involved in MMORPG. Name the Company you subcontract
for, just the first name.

Now perhaps you are in the network, servicing the network. Let me look
there. I see a Genuity office in the RECORD (YAHOO.COM). Thats the
only outfit that may have something to do with Sony, but I think not.

Now I may believe you are just using this as an ISP and you live in
NY, Califoria, or Seattle. That begs the question: "Could you not find
an ISP in those areas and not in this small town in the suburbs of
Milwaukee?"

No, you are a bored fraud in the suburbs of Milwaukee, probably living
in your parents basement. Get a girlfriend and leave us alone OR quit
spewing BS.
