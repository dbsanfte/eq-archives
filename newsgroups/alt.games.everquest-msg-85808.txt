Yes, in Verants eyes it is illegal. Accounts are not transferrable, this is
actually to stop people letting others use their accounts then crying to CS
when they user doesn't give it back or trying to sell accounts but the buyer
not giving the cash or the sell not giving the details, sharing passwords
etc....In all these cases Verant do not want the aggro so they have a simple
rule, do it and the account will be banned (account not player, necessarily)
If you are using the account of a friend and there is no dispute ie your
friend is not going to try and reclaim it, you have no worries as I doubt
Verant actually care, just don't advertise the fact in game.
