Sorry to bother with this one, but have searched a lot of sites and can't
find answer...

Why do the merchants in Shadowhaven give me so much attitude, and who do I
have to kill to make them like me [I am very insecure].

Oh, yeah, they are making snide remarks about my being a Wood Elf - thought
briefly of lecturing them on the brotherhood of all beings and then killing
them all, but need somewhere to sell stuff in this area.  They are [semi]
hosing me on goods, at least those that will talk to me at all.

Anyway, if I can find out the factions I figure I'll work on my standings
and that should be the answer.

Yes?  No?
