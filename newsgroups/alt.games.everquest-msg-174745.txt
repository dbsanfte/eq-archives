Thanks all for the thoughts on this.  I did not notice (nor think to look)
about an accidental "Walk" situation or even remotely think of "Duck".
There's the noobie showing in me.  I usually have very little lag problem,
I'm on cable and have an AMD 2000xp 512meg PC2100, Geforce3, Soundblaster,
clean install Windows XP (Home). However, I do notice frequent packet loss.
Where monsters will sometimes "warp" from one side of the screen to the
other.

I will certainly pay more attention to the Walk/Run button from now on.

Thanks all (again) for your help and suggestions.

Happy Hunting
