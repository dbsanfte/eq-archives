    The change makes the changed zone useless. Just what the game needs - a
way for players to reduce the total content available. The real pisser is
how some guilds have justified it - "Now we never need to go back to that
shithole of a zone ever again." The attitude there just boggles the mind.

    You'd think so from how the script has been mangled, but on some servers
post-Conquest it still happened. Really, with how warped things have been
it's hard to know what was supposed to happen. Waking the Sleeper is like a
box of chocolates....

    It's not a bad idea, though, for future "one-off" events. You destroy
the one-time-only-uber-master mob, you clear the zone and anything with
affiliated content for good. Perhaps if top guilds saw something like this
as biting them in the ass they wouldn't do it.

    Except the server isn't ripe, one guild is. If it took a server-wide
push to do something like this, then yes, I'd agree. For example, imagine
the transition condition was "all NPCs level 40 and above in all city zones
have to be dead for transition to 'post-apocalyptic Norrath'". That would
require a ton of people committed to seeing change, and couldn't be forced
on a server by a minority.

    To an extent this is happening now, with planned revamps (Legends first,
of course) of places like Nurga and Cazic Thule. I find it disappointing
that as the game evolves more new players are being funnelled into the
Oasis-LoIO-OT-DL method of levelling by changes of this sort, but I guess
you have to cater to the majority of the player base.

    The idea of killing stuff just so others can't is obscene. This is
perhaps the only zone in game where the PNP can't be used to force a
rotation - you kill all four warders and you stop folks cold, period. It
says a lot about the guilds that have done this knowing what would happen
that they would do it. If you aren't good enough to kill stuff as fast as an
up-and-coming guild, don't wreck the game for others - admit you suck and
get the hell out of the way, or try harder and show them who's number one.

    It's not just jealousy, it's a matter of time. Changes made to the game
always seem to come after the first guild gets to an encounter and have
farmed it a bit. The changes are almost always nerfs, to increase difficulty
of the encounter. Now guild number two, hot on the heels of guild number
one, comes along and faces a tougher encounter than guild number one AND
doesn't have the loot the encounter already dropped to overcome it like
guild one has. They face a double whammy trying to catch up. Saying "well,
we should have been faster" doesn't really help when you're trying to
overcome more obstacles than guild number one faced, unless you wait for so
long that you get the aid from future expansions to overcome an encounter.

    Nobody should do it. Verant needs to be shown in no uncertain terms that
events like that are unacceptable to the majority of the player base, if
that is the case. Since Sleeper's they've put in new "world-changing"
content that can be changed back, which seems to work much better. I wish I
could remember the name of the SoL zone, but there's one zone which has a
large number of cavemen or rockhoppers spawning in it. Killing the boss mob
caveman "switches" the zone over to spawning Rockhoppers, and vice versa.
Things change, but nobody has to miss out on anything.

    Too competitive. I mean, come on - you can't win EQ. You can get a
server first, but those are forgotten pretty fast. I can remember only some
of my server's firsts, and I'm pretty good about remembering our past. All
the newer players could care less if you were first, they just want the phat
lewts now plz.

    No. If we can't beat them on even terms we don't deserve to be a top
guild. Any first I could get after waking the Sleeper would be hollow,
because we didn't beat anybody to the prize - we got a head start a long
time ago and kept it.
