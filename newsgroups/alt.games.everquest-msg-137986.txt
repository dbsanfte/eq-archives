I'll try and do that.  Thanks for the offer, that would really be a
tremendous help.  I do have invis to undead potions, but, of course, they
have that nasty side effect of not working against live creatures.  :)

By tonight, I assume you meant last night, the 31st?

I did go the the Safehouse, and read up on it there, but it had this really
big disclaimer at the top that said the epic quest had changed since that
walkthrough, without providing any of the details of the change.  Do those
changes affect the General part of the quest?
