Pets take ZERO EXP unless I am AFK (or act like it) and let them solo?
And if so, I still take 25%?

POWER LEVEL THE NECROS!!!!

Also the change to not allow pet based agro is nice.  Now I can SAFELY take
my pet through the desert or any place with wondering low LV KOS to everyone
mobs.

Now that we're on the topic of pet fixes, when will they fix the problem
with our pets caring for us more than we care for ourselves?  Just a minor
annoyance.
"Your pet judges you amiable."
"You consider yourself indifferently."
For RP reasons, I could understand not making all other players judge you
amiable, but at least let yourself judge yourself as something more than
indifferent?
