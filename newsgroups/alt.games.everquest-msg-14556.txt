Yep, but the mob will summon to "it's" x,y.  That's why sometimes you
will be smacking at a mob and suddenly find yourself "inside" the mob
and have to take a step or two back to start hitting again.

It's not sufficient to be within melee range.  Summon brings you to
the same (or really freaking close) x,y as the mob.

Depends.
This tactic nullified the AoE Dot/Slow of the dragon.  It made a mess
of the aggro management *however* had the main tank been able to keep
aggro throughout the fight, the clerics would never get summoned and
consequently this tactic would have allowed them to generate a lot
more damage output in the same time than they should have without
resorting to the rez effect.

Because it's not always the case that the cleric won't get summoned.
If they are off in the x,y by a small margin, they will be summoned.
However, the difference is between getting summoned every 10 seconds
or getting summoned when you screw up your placement.

No they can't.
Spell stacking code is one the area they've fubarred.  This is why
there's so many bug around it.

They can't fix it in an instant.
