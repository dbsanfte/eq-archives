While probably not immune, the General for the rogue epic is close enough 
to immune to magic (after Tash and Malo) that I found it worthwhile to 
Insidious Decay, then Cloud of Grummus him (Unresistable disease debuff, 
40% disease based slow).  It was far better than no slow, and allowed me to 
continue attempting to Turgur's him a few times unsuccessfully.  I am sure 
there are other mobs that are similar.
