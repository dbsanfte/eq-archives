If it's really "hogging" or farming, or whatever, I can certainly see that.  I
don't want to be the kind of player that does that.  What I'm wondering about is
the rare spawn with multiple placeholders that drops something you specifically
need for a quest.  If I camp that for hours on end, killing placeholders and
waiting for the rare spawn, it sounds like somebody else can just walk in and
snag it anyway, with no recourse for me.  Sad. particularly with the first hit
rule. Unless I'm paired up with a spellcaster of some sort, I will rarely get
the first shot in.  Anybody can put the first hit on with a spell before I can
run over and kick it.
