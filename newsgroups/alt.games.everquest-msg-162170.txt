You know, the sad thing is, I think it would be fairly easy to let warriors
solo without unbalancing them.  All you need to do is up their sitting regen
so it's similar to a Paladin's with Divine Purpose (scaled for level).  That
would mean that they would get none of the benefits while actually fighting,
but still be able to reduce their downtime to something manageable.
