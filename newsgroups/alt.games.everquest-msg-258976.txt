Some ideas that are obvious, but you never know....

(1) Buy a geerlok for research. They sell in Bazaar for, like, 30-50pp on
Xev, probably something similar on your server.  Cheap enough that there's
almost no good reason to say no.

(2) Surf vendors *constantly*. Once a day is good enough, but hit as many
as you can, and keep an eye out for the pieces you not only need *now* but
will need in the next 10 levels too. My usual surfing trip was: log the
froggie wizard, gate to HHK, check the dozen merchants there. Port to NK,
check gypsies and the one in guard tower. Bop to EK, check the merchants
by the farm and the ones by xorbb entrance. Switch to troll beastlord,
check out the friendly folks at OT outpost. Log on whoever and check the
vendors in PoK. Check the all the tradeskill guys. Check all the spell
vendors in the library, if you have the time. Keep your eyes peeled for
components that *any* of your chars are looking for, not just your necro.
Heck, sometimes you may get lucky and find researched spells that have
been sold back!

(3) Don't be afraid to ask friends/guildies/strangers for a combine, if
you're of the opinion that it *has* to succeed. I did this for Voice Graft
and the L24 pet because I had such a hard time getting the components.
Most of the other spells I typically had enough for 3-8 tries before running
out, so it wasn't (typically) worth the hassle.

(4) Let your friends know what you're missing. Maybe they'll spot something.
I'll occasionally merchant surf on my own, but I'll know if my necro partner
is having a hard time finding some part. So I'll keep an eye open for her.

Good luck! At least you can be thankful that you don't have any chain
research like a mage...
