Based on your posting history here so far, your assurances mean
exactly nothing to me.

You see, I can't help but note that the headers when you posted as
"litningmatt" are virtually identical as when you posted from
"litningmatt2". Same e-mail address, same IP, same posting service,
same newsreader. The only difference was you added a little "2" at the
end of your screen name. 

Now, perhaps there was some legitimate reason for doing this, but I
cannot think of what it might be. It looks very much as though you
changed it specifically to get past a kill file filter.

>you're basically worthless to me, but you're beginning to annoy me

Then why not kill file me? I can guarantee you that *I* won't be
changing my screen information to try to weasel around a kill file.
