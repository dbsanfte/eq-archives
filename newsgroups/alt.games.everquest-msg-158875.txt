Hi all, I rushed out and just bought the PoP expansion when it finally
arrived locally.  Actually 'rushed' was the key word.  I ended up with
the pack with the figurine (didn't notice until checkout.....realy, I
didn't) and got home to discover it was the original version plus the
PoP expansion.

If I install this will it overwrite SoV and SoL?  
If I reinstall those to fix will it overwrite PoP?
I I reinstall original plus PoP CD will it overwrite SoV and SoL?
If I reinstall those to fix will it overwrite PoP?
I I reinstall original plus PoP CD will it overwrite SoV and SoL?
If I reinstall those to fix will it overwrite PoP?

Anyway, you get the picture?  I was too busy last night to install it
anyway, so I thought I might save some trouble by asking the question
here.

I can't realy take it back as I gave the figurine to the gal at the
checkout.  She played too and thought it was cool.  I just thought it
would make my wife look at me funny.

Thanks all
