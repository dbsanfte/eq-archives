Dont worry about faction yet.

As for hunting spots, I think either iceclad snow cougars are good for you,
or head to Eastern wastes and try for a Rygorr camp.

Someone else can clarify on the Rygorr camp bit, not sure what the normal
level of hunting there is, but I know the normal guards and that are in
their 30s, so might be good.
