Possibly. Wizards don't quad there until a bit higher than you are. And
if they get caught during the quad, they die. Those raptors are tough,
not in the fact that you could't handle one of them with your
shaman/warrior combo, but in that they have an insane aggro radius, and
it's so hard to get one. (Couple exceptions, but for most pulls it's
risky.) You may want to come back in a few levels if you can ever find
it uncamped. Probably the most popular quadding site for wizards post
55.

You can still do them. They will give fair xp into your mid fifties,
though most are light blue then, if not all. But they are one of the
easiest mobs of their type and the loot can be fair.

Forget it. You are the wrong two people in the wrong place at the wrong
time to do the dino. That's not a melee fight you want to get involved
in. Around level fifty we went there with a warrior, cleric, rogue trio.
Ally took our lunch money and made us cry three times running before we
went home. 

On the other hand, at 51 my wife and I camped him just fine with a wizzy
necro duo. However, we can fear him. That makes a difference. She can
solo him now. ;-)

Others have already suggested the Hole. You specified "relatively safe".
Another thing to look at is to go to the Dreadlands to the abandoned
combine city and try the plaguebone thieves inside the pyramid/library.
Easy kills and will give xp for a few more levels. Loot is non-existant,
but xp if fairly safe and easy. It's usually camped, but you might get
it in off hours.

With your shaman partner's slowing, hasting, and buff/debuff abilities,
you could even consider the BW zone line of skyfire, though I think it's
a bit early for you. However, with careful pulling you could get the
bottomless gnawers, wyverns, and skyash drakes. Avoid the chromodracs at
all cost, and if you get something bigger (with "Elder" in it's name,
etc.) or a named one, just run away.

Have you tried Eastern Wastes? A fair number of things there are still
dark blue at fifty, and most are light blue. That could be a good shot.
I'd try the bigger species of mammoths to the south of the Iceclad
bridge.
