/agree. eqatlas is about the only place, and aside from the maps
themselves, the information on mobs and drops is pretty much scant. Then
again, I don't know how many people are submitting yet about the new
stuff they find. I've run across a few items with my friends thus far,
and I've yet to submit anything. Too lazy or busy I suppose. I really
should, though. We were in Tennobrous Friday and found a few of the
named up in the zone over a period of time. Got some odd drops. Nothing
to get a hard on over in your fifties, but they should be documented
nonetheless. I see nothing on the web sites yet about them.

Speaking of Tennobrous (sp?) mountains. The one comment I had to my
group during our hunt there was, "This is SO going to get nerfed!"

That zone if chock full of the absolute gimpiest mobs I've ever seen
that are still full blue, xp-giving beasts to a group of low fifties.
The casters weren't bothering putting any dots or such down because they
died so fast. And this was an ad-hoc weak group, too. We'd shown up just
to rescue some corpses for a guild druid who accidentally fled into the
vampire castle thinking it was the zone line. Our cleric had to log
after the rezzing, and we were left with a group of warrior, rogue,
druid, shaman. All low fifties and uppper forties. Not exactly a
powerhouse combination. We were slaughtering blues to the point where I
was running a quarter way across the zone to find something else to
pull. The only things that were any challenge at all were the vampires,
but they are cake too if you kill them quickly and don't get swarmed.

Loot was crap but that xp was waaaaaaaaaaaay too easy. Look for those
mobs to get beefed up soon.
