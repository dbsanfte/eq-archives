By all means, yes. Slowing is the most important thing I do as
a shaman, along with healing when no other healer is present.

The slows and heals get done first. What happens after that
is the real question. Do I spend 100 mana buffing a tank's
STR or STA or DEX or AGI for *over an hour* or spend 100 mana
doing 200 DoT damage to one single mob?

That the stat buffs last so long is the beauty of them. Even
a miniscule increase in damage output or damage avoidance
turns into something worthy of consideration when multiplied
by the time the buff lasts.
