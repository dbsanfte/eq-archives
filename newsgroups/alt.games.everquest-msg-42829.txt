There's loads of copies on the Lake Of Ill Omen Zone, on Kunark. Kill some
Sarnaks, such as in the fort, or just any Iskars that wander the zone and
loot the corpses, you'll find loads of the different Words and Runes there,
just keep searching

Incase you need this: To get to LOIO you've too options. If your an Iskar,
then access it from Cabilis. If not, then if your a lightie race get the
boats from Butcher Block to Fironia Vie...You'll then have to run a lvl 40
zone a little too zone to LOIO *just follow river to a waterfall, and keep
following til you zone. Mind the evil spiders!* If your a darkie, you'll
have to go from there port (Neriak? I dunno what it is, but its in South
Antonica.)
