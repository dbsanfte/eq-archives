first of all, jekke you fucker, im not a troll, im just new to posting.

secondly, everquest is just one big long beta. and we are the hamsters that
they use to test it.

thirdly, eq is here because people WANT to play it. verant doesnt FORCE you
to play it. if you DONT like the DOWNTIME, then DONT play it. QUIT.

they provide you with an at least 10:1 ratio of uptime/downtime, so shut the
fuck up and stop acting like they owe you something. you pay for what you
get.

look at it this way.
most people spend 50 bucks on a new game when it comes out about every month
or so, if not every month, then every 2 months.

6x50 = 300
12x50 = 600

your EQ sub. = 13 a month
12x13 = 136 a year.

shut the fuck up and enjoy the game.
