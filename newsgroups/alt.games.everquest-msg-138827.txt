I did 4c last night (single group), for the first time.  It is a tough
camp... but not in the general sense.

In about 4-5 hours we got 1 flesh grinder, when the second named popped
though, our trigger-happy warrior accidently fired an arrow way too early
(the wandering mobs were in agro range).

If you thought it was a rough camp exping in, try c.r'ing from there :(
