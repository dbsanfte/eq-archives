I find it quite amusing that those who are not raid inclined and/or level
think that your (prospective) guild's ruling/decision sucks and those that
are, agree with it.

Personally, speaking as someone that is not truely raid level (highest
character is 53, main is 52) and not in the least bit raid inclined, I agree
with your Guild. If you join a group of gamers that have a focus then you
should be willing to sacrafice your playing time for that focus, or what was
the point of joining them?
I have not ever tried to be part of an active guild for this reason, I am
not willing to put in the commitment and I am fully aware that this will
mean I get left behind and will not see many zones or be apart of many
encounters.

The arguement of "it's just a game" holds no water. It IS just a game but
like many other online games you get out of it what you put in, if you only
want to treat it casualy then don't try and be a part of those that put in
the effort to get the most from it.
