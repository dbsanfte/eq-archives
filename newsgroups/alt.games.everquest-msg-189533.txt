I dont know about that.  Since I started my character, as a Necro, I
have been able to beat full group xp with soloing from level 1 to 65.  I
believe that some other classes can do this too.  If its supposed to be
in the 'vision' that groups out xp soloers, then they need to make
massive changes to the game.  Most spots simply dont have enough pulls
in range to support a full group getting great xp.  Whereas a soloist
only needs a small camp of static mobs to farm xp like mad.

On a related note, I have never been in a group that could beat an AA
every two hours, including ones in the Tactics pit.  Maybe we were doing
something wrong.  What is your group composition and what exactly are
you doing?
