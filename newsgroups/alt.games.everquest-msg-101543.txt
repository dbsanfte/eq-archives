" long time ago, the dimension of Deva had undergone an economic
collapse. To survive, the Deveels (who I once knew as devils) used
their ability to travel the dimensions and become merchants. Through
the process of natural selection, the most successful Deveels were not
the best fighters, but the best traders. Now, after countless
generations of this process; the Deveels were acknowledged as the best
merchants in all the dimensions. They were also acknowledged as being
the shrewdest, coldest, most profit-hungry cheats ever to come down
the pike.

The Bazaar at Deva was their showcase. It was an all-day, all-night,
year-round fair where the Deveels met to haggle with each other over
the wares fetched back from the various dimensions. Though it was
originally established and maintained by Deveels, it was not unusual
to find travelers from many dimensions shopping the endless rows of
displays and booths. The rule of thumb was, "If it's to be found
anywhere, you'll find it at the Bazaar at Deva." " Myth Conceptions by
