Ogre cultural has to be made by an ogre in Oggok. The catch is that
races with similar characteristics and deities can wear other races'
cultural armor:

high elves (offers imbued leather for all Tunare druids/rangers -
might be wearable for more races when non-imbued)

erudites, wood elves and half elves (offers imbued leather for all
Karana druids/rangers)
Erudite cultural is erudite only
Barbarian cultural is wearable by barbarians, humans and half elves
Dark elf cultural is wearable by dark elves and half elves
Dwarven chainl is wearable by dwarves, halflings, gnomes, humans, wood
elves, half elves
Dwarven plate is wearable by dwarves, halflings and gnomes
Iksar cultural is iksar only
Human full plate is wearable by humans, barbarians, erudites and half
elves
Human field plate is wearable by human, barbarians, erudites and half
elves in non imbued forms; certain imbues can be worn by wood elves,
dwarves, halflings and gnomes
Human seafarer's ringmail is wearable by humans, barbarians, erudites,
high elves, half elves, wood elves, dark elves and iksar
