I have 3 machines, and one has a light show going on (for company, mostly),
and no it doesnt drain alot of power, the lights are LED, or light emitter
diode, and they use next to nothing in power, even though some of them are
bright as hell.


but yeah, I even have one of those antec tubes that changes
colors/brightness based on sound.
