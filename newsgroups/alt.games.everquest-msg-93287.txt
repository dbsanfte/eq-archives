 Perhaps they aren't because Verant has already said once Sleeper is
awake and gone that's it. There is no quest to bring him back and
according to Verant there isn't going to be one. Yeah yeah, we all know
Verant sometimes goes back and changes things they said would never be
changed but those are exceptions and not the rule.

 Good job, Verant. It's not like the high-end game needed one less zone
to keep people occupied. That story about a guild on Stormhammer not
being able to wake the Sleeper on the first day was quite amusing. If
it's all nice and good from a role-playing aspect why are they not being
allowed to fire off your precious script? Fucking hypocrites. Take your
$40 a month and shove it up your ass until it shoots out your nose and
your head spins around.


 Ah. I feel better now.
