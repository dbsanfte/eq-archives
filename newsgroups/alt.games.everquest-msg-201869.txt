I originally wouldn't play anything other than a necromancer.  I really
began to rely on having that pet to guard me and do a lot of the dirty work.
I eventially decided I would give some other classes more than a
half-hearted attempt and have found them to rewarding once I started to
learn their intricacies.  I really have enjoyed playing a bard, enchanter,
druid and am currently trying out my first beast lord.  I didn't really
enjoy the first 8 levels of the beast lord's life, especially levels 7 and
8; not having a pet and not being able to cast spells was driving me up the
wall.  I apologize to any melee types out there but I could never play a
pure melee class mostly becuase of the reliance on grouping.  However, once
I hit level 9 and got my pet and a few spells, the enjoyment factor has
stepped up considerably.  I still feel less effective than a comparable
level necromancer, but I'm going to take it at least to the mid-twenties
before I establish a preference.  I know there are a lot of die-hard beast
lords out there that claim it's the best, most enjoyable class to play.
We'll see...

I guess what I am attempting to covey is to give another class or two a
serious attempt.  If you got burned out on the necro before, chances are
you'll burn out faster if you have to do it all again.  At least I would.
