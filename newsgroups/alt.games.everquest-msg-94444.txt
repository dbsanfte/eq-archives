Very efficient combination.

Druid snares 4 and startes running them around.  when they pass the
necro, he fears one and sends in 1 dot and his pet.  Druid runs around
a lot, but since pretty much he's just snaring, the mana is OK.  As
long as the necro twitches him once in a while.  We can kill around 80
mobs an hour doing this in "the grey" at level 52.  as long as we
don't pull those rocks.On Sun, 17 Feb 2002 23:32:50 +0000 (UTC),
