It's Gaijin and it actually means foreigner, it is a not really an endearing
term.
I know of no other words for Ronin, a Samurai with no maste.r although I
think ronin actually translates to unemployed or something similar, in the
same way as Samurai translates to "To Serve"
Could be wrong, I'd like to be able to say my Japanese is crap, but it's not
even that good
