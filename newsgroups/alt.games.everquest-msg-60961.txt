Then try to develop for something other than the Gameboy.

The 256MB of RAM requirement (more like 512, in fact), is due to the
enormous amount of new models; not only the new characters, but all the
different possible pieces of weapons and armor that can be displayed at
any given moment. More content == More RAM. It doesn't matter if you are
some kind of crack Finnish Amiga demo code-god, if you put more content
in, you need more memory, and no amount of clever programming trickery
can get around that.
