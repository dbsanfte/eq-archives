If you're soloing who cares what others think? ;^)  They are all over the
place, and sometimes frowned on in groups if not well played.

I primarily play a hybrid class.  The typical bot for those classes are
shaman, enchanter or druid.  Shaman for heals, slow, haste, sow, DoTs, DDs.
Enchanter for haste, slow, mez, mana regen.  Druid for heals, regen, damage
shield, DoTs, DDs, sow and ports.  Each have their pluses and minuses.
