51 Ranger.  Wearing mostly Ivy Etched armor, although I did get some sweet
boots and gloves from a couple of PoF raids. Also using a Flux Bladed Axe
from PoF and a SS of Ykesha.  I can deal out some good damage when the
things proc, but it's never when I really, really need it :(

I really don't know my way around the dead side - that's where I tend to get
killed - once before at about 49 trying to find my way out from the Frenzy
room.  I'm trying to figure the place out, but if I can't even defend myself
against stuff that cons as "easy"...sheesh!
