>No, this is not a dickwaving thread.

((Let me preface this by saying I am much too tired, and this is
likely to be a bit rambling.))

Haha, last Vxed group I did, the only question we asked the Warrior
was "Do you have a bow?" "Preferably without a DD component." "Oh,
yeah, and bring lots of arrows."

I don't do Vxed groups with a normal set up, because you do need an
uber tank to make it work. A kite group in HoH or a Root/Rot group in
Vxed work much better.

I'd get a little upset if Duug (55th level Warrior, retired) was asked
what his AC/HP was before joining a LDoN group, but It's an
unfortunate problem with the power skew in GoD (particularly the
trials) that you have to have an uber tank to do it. If anyone on FV
is ever asked what their AC/HP are before being invited into the
group, it's simply because, anything less than uber has no chance of
success.

Luckily before I retired him, he was never asked what his HP/AC was
until the group was formed and we needed to decide who of the
available people would get the dubious honor of being smacked by the
mobs.

On FV people seem to be more interested in doing something that they
can do with any fairly competent group of people regardless of class
or equipment, rather than spending hours looking for the perfect class
mix, let alone turning down a tank simply because he didn't have uber
equipment.

Honestly, there have been times I would have been lynched (literally)
if I told my group (even in jest) that I turned down a knight class or
warrior because he wasn't uber enough. Sometimes we're lucky to get
anyone that can wear plate to stand in front of a mob for us. We press
Monks and Rogues into the tank position if we have to, we're lucky if
we can find a Bard to fill in as tank sometimes. This was all before I
joined an active guild of course. Now I do guild groups almost
exclusively.

My experience has been that most groups are willing to give it a shot
at trying to do something with a less than optimal mix than wait for
the perfect group. (My last pickup group was about a week ago, we were
in PoV, with a rogue tanking (followed later by a SK whose HP dropped
almost as fast as the rogue's did) and a shaman to do the healing.
They added me to do the healing once the other shaman decided that he
had to go eventually. We found out quite quickly that with one shaman
slowing and the other healing, we could hold up a constant pull rate,
but with only one shaman we could barely kill one before my mana was
gone. So we broke up after a few attempts. So non-optimal groups are
quite possible, and even common. As a Shaman, I find myself part of
them quite often. That's not to say we don't have our share of
asshats, though.

(For example, the rogue from above went nuts when the shaman on heals
used torpor to heal her. While she was tanking. She went on for 5
minutes about how it screws up her DPS. Of course, our DPS wasn't our
limiting factor, it was the mana pool of our healer, so anything that
extended it was good, as long as the tank (in this case the rogue)
could maintain agro and the loss of the rogue DPS (from the mob's
front arc of course) did not extend the combat length enough to out
weigh the added efficiency of the heal. She kept going on and on about
how he should "never, ever, ever, cast that snare shit on me while the
mob is still standing". That went on until I observed that I also
rather preferred that he not use torpor on her, because it'd be fun to
watch her hit the dirt as soon as he ran out of mana. If only because
corpses can't bitch about snare heals. She stopped complaining then.
Not because she understood that as a tank, she has only two jobs. 1.)
Stay the focus of the mob's attention. 2.) Stay alive, so that job one
still applies. Doing damage to the mob is almost completely
un-important to her position as tank, as long as she can maintain
agro. The reason she stopped bitching, is because the other shaman
liked my idea a lot, and was willing to make it happen. In the rogue's
defense, she was thinking from the DPS slot position that she is
almost exclusively in. Thinking like a tank, is not something that
rogues normally find themselves having to do. Of course, most tanks
don't like the snare heals any more than the next person anyway.
Sometimes for legitimate reasons, and sometimes, because they like to
deal damage too, and feel cheated if they don't get to do all the
damage they should be doing.)
