Relax, he's just employing the  Reverse Boasting Tactic.  It's a common
(albeit obvious) tactic whereby players with very good gear, who are not
getting enough inspection requests to sooth their egos, complain about their
gear as a means of acquiring praise.  It's most commonly employed by
insecure adolescents and most often seen in pick-up groups where the main
topic of conversation is "my gear sucks" followed by trading of links and
the ensuing praise of one-another's gear.
