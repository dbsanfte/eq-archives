I've used my bard to speed up someones journey once, since we were both headed
in the same direction. At least, the journey would have been quick if he hadn't
stopped to fight along the way. No yell or warning, just a /gsay to say he got
left behind. He only did it twice, which is just as well 'cause I'd decided to
leave him behind if he did it a third time.
