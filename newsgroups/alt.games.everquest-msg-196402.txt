Fine. KEI wasn't a factor according to the OP. My point - and it *was* 
solicited - was that a shaman being the best option for pulling in a 
group that includes both a ranger and a monk is not the way the game was 
designed to work. The only way for it *to* work is through massive 
twinking. I consider it supporting data for the argument against 
twinking, because it basically eliminates the need for several classes in 
a group.

Let's try to not be so over sensitive to anything negative being said 
about KEI, shall we?
