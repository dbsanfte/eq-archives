Sometimes society finds a crime so abhorrent, that
they will make new laws, not only to punish the
offender, but also to tell society that they
recognise a crime as being substantially different
from any other.

The idea isn't accurate?

It isn't a special crime, its an ordinary crime,
like any other.

Thats fine, but not what I was talking about.

What exactly do you think the deterrent effect of
a punishment is intended to deter?

Don't all crime require some degree of intent?

To be found guilty of murder in England, and
sentenced to capital punishment, you had to be
found guilty of the crime "with malice
aforethought" (synonymous to "premeditation" in
the USA, I believe). In effect, being punished for
your thoughts.

To be found guilty of murder in England nowadays,
the prosecution has to prove intent. If you are
merely indifferent as to the outcomes of your
actions, and this results in death, it is a
different crime, ie manslaughter.

I know it is not exactly similar in the US, but
the point is, that a lot of crimes have different
punishments according to what thoughts the
criminal had in his mind.

Is it?

That would be for a jury to decide.

That also, would be a matter for the jury.

That person, I would argue, has to bear the
consequences of his actions.

There are a lot of innocent people in jail. Hate
crime law is another law in which people will get
wrongfully convicted, but I don't see how this law
would be any worse than a myriad of other laws.

They are not being hanged because of their
bigotry, but because they let their bigotry
dictate the course of their actions.
