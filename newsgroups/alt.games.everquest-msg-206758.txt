Hello all,
Any answers to the queries below would be appreciated...

Does anyone know if Sony are giving out those 30-day trial keys still?
 Are they valid for all expansions or just the old world?

I'm thinking of starting a second account, and rolling up a cleric to
have as a healer / rezzbot.  My main is a 61 ranger...does anyone have
any suggested PLing strategies?

TIA
