Brad,

Nice to see you in Usenet... :)

I agree with most or all of the rules for the RP server, but there is
something missing... For the love of god, either force people to use the
random name generator, or impose a *fascist* naming policy, with
absolutely ruthless GMs hunting down and killing improper names. The
naming situation is, for me, the single biggest obstacle to roleplaying
in the standard servers. Sorry, I just can't roleplay with someone
called "Nosowforu".

I got to play a little of Luclin at E3... Great job, guys, can't wait.
