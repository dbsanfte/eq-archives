I started doing this same thing yesterday with VNC.  VNC works fine EXCEPT 
I can't do much with the cursor.  There is about a 40x40 pixel wide area of 
the screen where the mouse works and it's very tedious getting it to go 
where you want.  Move the local mouse a pixel in this area and it moves it 
about 20-30 on the EQ Machine.  But, I can send tells, /aucs, etc and see 
what has been sold.  That's all I use it for and it works fine.

I'm using the standard VNC not any of the spinoffs.  WinXP Pro on the EQ 
machine.  8-bit mode.  I have my vendor sit down and stare at the ground.
