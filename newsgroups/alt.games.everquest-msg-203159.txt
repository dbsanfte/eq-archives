> Does Kazad's Mark stack with Aego, BoA, Virtue, and HoV?

Aego and Blessing of aego, and Virtue/HoV are just single and group versions
of the exact same spells.   None stack.

Kazad also doesn't stack with any of them.  Think of it like this -

Aego is an "all in 1, HP/symbol/AC buff" very long duration.  Virtue is just
an upgrade on this.

Alternatively, a HP buff (e.g pot9) stacks with a symbol (kazad) and an AC
buff (Gallantry)

Druid buffs will stack with symbol, but not with aego.
