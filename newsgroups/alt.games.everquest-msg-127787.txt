The resulting maps from the parsed map files look a lot (exactly) like the
maps created for ShowEQ.  For what it's worth.

I've been interested in the concept of actual topographic maps for the
outdoor zones.  (Tox, N Karanas, Dag Cauldron) theoretically people can get
the zone files and load them into a 3d program, then all you have to do is
intelligently use a vertical clipping plane to create sections and then put
circles around the sections in photoshop or something (I've helped an
animator do this for golf courses)...  That would be kewl.  Much better than
the maps on EQAtlas which have absolutely no topographical information at
all...

Of course, I don't know what verant's opinion on all of this would be.
