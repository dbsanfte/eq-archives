Interesting - I have no clear recollection of
learning to read, only of reading (I'm 37).  I do
remember by Dad reading The Wind in the Willows
to me, and I remember reading it (I still have that
edition with the color plates - battered but on 
my bookcase.)


Of course he provided us with the usual - the
entire set of Hardy Boys, all the Tom Swift
(was that him - boy inventor?) novels in the
special edition hardback, among others.

I also remember him bringing books home from the 
library for me, one in particular was Dana's
"Two Years Before the Mast" which I read at 11ish,
the entire set of Horatio Hornblower novels, and
all of Heinlein's juvenile works.

I think I was 12ish when I first read all the 
Burroughs novels (those dang Barsoom ones leapt
off the shelf at me - NAKED LADIES :) the age is
fairly certain, as I remember hiding the covers from
Mrs. Tchanz in junior high) and I absolutely 
devoured his Dick Francis novels. 

However, at 12-13, Deighton, LeCarre and the like
were still a little to involved plot-wise for me.

In retrospect I think I learned to read by reading,
no particular method involved.
