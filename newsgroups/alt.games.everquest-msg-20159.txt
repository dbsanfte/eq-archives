 Getting some characters onto another account. Two examples off the top
of my head:

 Two people sharing the same account. They now can peel the characters
off to two different accounts allowing them to play at the same time.

 I have a high level Druid. It would be nice to be able to teleport my
other characters around but I can't since they are all on one account.
Let me move my Druid to another account and that solves that problem. A
high level cleric would also be a good candidate for that so you can res
yourself.
