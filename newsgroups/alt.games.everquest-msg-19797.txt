Well, at 29 I lose about 3 blue in a death, but if I'm hunting in Highkeep I
make that back in about half an hour ( being bound in the same zone as
you're hunting helps )
Anywhere else, I just get pissed, do a CR and keep going...

Probably gonna really want them at 31 though...

and dont worry about the money, It will come... a few days trading in EC
helps though, a lot of my money comes from getting lucky in trades ( E.G. a
DX sewing kit for a rygorr bracer and some funky bard horn I traded for 4
50+ spells, instantly turned around and sold 1 of the spells for 500,
another for 50, later another for 50 and one that mustve disappeared or
something... also traded a blackjack for a rygorr bracer, bladed thulian
claws, sarnak eitchata and shield of slain unicorn, traded claws for silvery
war axe and nearly traded axe and shield for adamantite bo stick, traded and
about 15 minutes later the guy was tellspamming me to trade back... I traded
back (and got 20pp for trouble) just to make the guy shut up )

and the spiders in the commons drop silk about every 20th time now.. (
believer me, I tried )

Don't need silk cord for backpacks.  just HQ bear skin and a backpack
pattern

For the love of god don't try to make the packs until your skill is at least
60 or so, you can sell the HQ bear pelts in EC for 30-35 pp ( seeing as how
we are on the same server, you can sell them to me, I'm gonna make packs
soon )

( BTW, I still have no idea what PITA means, besides a tasty bread sandwich
thing, somebody care to enlighten me? )

Guk is fine for silk, if theres no one there, which everytime I've been down
there ( okay, only once ) has been camped silly by 50+ people...

EK is much more on my travel path, so if theres spiders around, I kill them,
if not, just keep going, and at 29 I still get green exp off crags ( got a
yellow bubble in 2 hours of silk farming )

Everybody complains about that... must be idiots =P  I have absolutely no
problems with getting lost in a dungeon, the problem I have is zoning in
somewhere where you cant tell which way you came from ( kithicor to WC or
Rivervale to misty )
