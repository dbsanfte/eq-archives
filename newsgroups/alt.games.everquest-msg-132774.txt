Not in my experience.  I've been on plenty of raids where I was one of the 
lowest level characters there and it didn't cause any problems, and there's 
hardly any difference between a 54 and a 55.  As with most 
level/item/class/race related issues in EQ, any difference is blown way out 
of proportion by people who really have no idea.
