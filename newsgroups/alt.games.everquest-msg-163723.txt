If you summarize the original (or leave it in, in it's entirety) at the top,
then your reply must neccessarily go at the bottom, also known as bottom
posting.

Now, let's look at it from a common sense perspective.  Can you remember
what every thread is about from one day to the next?  I can't, they change
topics all the time (ie, what does this thread have to do with kiting in
OOT?), they branch, different branches deal with different things.  If you
top post, all the reader sees is your reply... to what?  They have to scroll
down and read it.  This is an effect, then cause situation, which is just
plain stupid.

OTOH, if you bottom post, people can get a clue as to what you're talking
about.

If you're replying to many points in a long post, then interleaving is the
most logical way to go.  It allows people to see what you're talking about,
instead of guessing and picking out what response applies to what paragraph.

I can't really see much of a case for top-posting.  Anything sufficiently
short as to make top-posting a viable option would still be best handled by
bottom posting.
