Not all of Islam takes place in mosques, nor does it necessarily require 
silly headgear...

Er... that is a point on which it's possible I'm in error, since I'm 
relying on the CIA for my info, and we all know how reliable Intelligence 
agencies are. :)

Anyway, from the CIA world factbook (2000 ed.)

Nationality:
noun: Bahraini(s)
adjective: Bahraini

Ethnic groups: Bahraini 63%, Asian 19%, other Arab 10%, Iranian 8%

Religions: Shi'a Muslim 75%, Sunni Muslim 25%

Maybe we should send them an update. :)

}Bahrain is far more "western" than any other Islamic nation.  Maybe 
}that's why it has a thriving economy that isn't based on oil.

Well, or maybe they have a natural resource available besides sand, oil 
and... more sand.  

}> I've lost track here... exactly which group is it that you were saying had

}> love google.  'People of Islamic countries'...
}And your point would be?  That I made a broad based statement?  Perish the
}thought, those never happen on usenet,

Yes, that is my point, and yes, it does happen, and if that's -not- what 
you meant, feel quite free to clarify. :)

}when one person's trying to be the sole voice of one side, and having to 
}reply to being double and triple teamed!

Funny, on this one, that's exactly how -I- feel.  Me vs. you and Dave, and 
I'd thought someone else, too... although now that I review, I see Dave 
only posted once on this topic, and no one else, so I'll quit whining now 
and take you on mano a mano while everyone's back is turned. :)
