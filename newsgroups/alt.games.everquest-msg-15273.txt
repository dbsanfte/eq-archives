Fletching, fletching and then fletching.

There are going to be times (levels 30+) when you want to be able to
FD-pull (using Feign Death to safely isolate single mobs). Casting a
spell has it's limitations (can't use DoT as your FD won't succeed)
and in a busy session, you can quickly go OOM.

Buy a bow, then sit and work on your fletching skill. It is the *one*
trade skill which actually has a purpose for my SK... and even in the
early stages, the arrows you produce can be used, albeit with limited
range/damage etc.

HTH :)
