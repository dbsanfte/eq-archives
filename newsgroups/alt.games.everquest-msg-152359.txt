Well, that's not what I was trying to say.  What I was saying is that
there is no class easier to play and get xp than Druid.  I actually
prefer playing Paladin, and this preference dates back to the early
months of the game when the Paladin class, to be frank, sucked.
That preference has nothing to do with ease of play, otherwise I'd
be a Druid, or, were I obsessed with how fast I could level solo
like certain individuals, I'd be a Necro.

Apples and oranges.  There are at least a hundred L50 Druids for
every L60 Enchanter, probably several hundred.  Why?  Because
only the braindead and the inanimate are incapable of leveling
a Druid.
