I hate having to wait the 4 seconds in case of a fizzle so do this.

 /stand
 /g Casting my uperpowerful spell_01
 /pause 4,/cast 1
 /pause 45,/cast 1
 /sit

If the .4 sec pause casts I get a "you cannot perform this action at this
time" message.
If the .4 sec pause fizzles line 4 casts.Hopefully not 2 fizzles at once.
Actually I use ctr+s to sit and stand. But showed this to keep the example's
continuity.
Please confirm the /pause 45 action completes even though the cast gets "
you can't do this"
message.
