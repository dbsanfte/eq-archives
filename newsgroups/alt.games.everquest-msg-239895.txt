I can comment on some specific instances, and yes, they remain Catholic.  
I can't comment in general, as I have not spoken with all of them, but, 
if you read the news, you would know that not everyone who is a member of 
the Catholic church agrees with everything it has done.

I disagree with many things that my government has done and is doing as 
well, but, yet, I remain a citizen.
