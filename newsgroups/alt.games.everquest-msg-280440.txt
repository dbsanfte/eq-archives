Unfortunately you're basically stuck doing the full patching, even if you've
copied the directories over.  I've not had much luck trying to find away
around it myself.

So make friends with someone that has a DSL/cable connection and a router.
Bring your computer over and hang out with him for a few hours until it
finishes patching.  That or tie up your phone line for several days.
