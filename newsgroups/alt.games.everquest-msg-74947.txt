One simple command,

in the Defaults section of your EQclient.ini just put the line:

TextureCache=TRUE

The first time, possibly the second and maybe the third time you go
from server select to char select this will take some time (mainly the
first time) On the fourth or so time and from then on it will be quite
fast.

1) put that line in

2) select server and get to char select

3) esc back out to desktop (or maybe just server select)

4) repeat until the blue line is quite fast or obviously faster.

What that does is preunpack the files it takes a long time to unpack.
This also takes up like 500 more meg of space on your hard drive.

With a p2 400, tnt 16 meg agp and 384 meg of ram, textures set to low
in options and this command in EQclient.ini I breeze through getting
from server select to char select and the blue line races across
screen.
