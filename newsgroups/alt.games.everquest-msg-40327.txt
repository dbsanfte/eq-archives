I did that once, also.  But I only lost about 7pp on a shield my druid
couldn't use.  300pp!  Ouch!

On a side note, if I have a caster or a non medium race ask to buy my banded
I always ask them if they know they can't wear it.  I had an enchanter buy a
full suit of banded. We did everything over tells and I never thoght to look
at what class she was.  Fortunately, when I did tell her she couldn't wear
it (after having already made it), she said she knew that and was outfitting
an alt bard. Whew!  A full suit is still a lot of failures at my skill
level.  I got paid 85pp for the suit and it cost me about 80pp to make.  I
made a suit the other day that only cost me about 60pp.  I think a perfect
suit with no failures will cost me about 35pp.  25pp for sheet metal and
another 10 or so for molds.

Well, I just realized I'm rambling so I'll stop now.
