Ah, Karana bandits.  Must be the overlooked source of low-level cash
in the game.

Four of us have been hunting there recently (levels 12-14, 2 clerics, a
wizard & a mage).  Making great XP and about 50pp an hour between us
from the bronze & sashes.  Plus the clerics like it since they get a
chance to tank and AoE as well :)  It's most satisfying to see 4 or 5
bandits all collapse at once...
