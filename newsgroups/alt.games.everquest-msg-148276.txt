    VI apparently has "plans" for Research. Since it currently caps at 200,
and (in theory) skill mods will take you all the way to the 252/255 skill
hard cap, this could eventually be useful.

    Again, Evocation caps at 235 so if skill mods work the way they were
supposed to work, this would be useful.

    I just wish that they'd hurry up and start testing the items for Planes
of Power faster. So far they've just done the tinkered stuff and some suits
of armour from Plane of Innovation, and while there's some neat things
(Weather Rocket that casts that druid "stop rain" spell, items with one
charge of Summon Banker and Summon Vendor) so far there's nothing that would
make one want to buy a new expansion. And nothing that indicates that
Research skill mods will be useful, either. ;-)
