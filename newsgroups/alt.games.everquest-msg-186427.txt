Well, for starters you interview more than three users.  In a case such as
this, you now have three viewpoints.  List them out, and use them as a basis
for interviewing other users.

Find which is the most pressing issue, resolve it, then move to the next
one.

If you find one which cannot be resolved, inform your users as such and
prepare for the firestorm which is to follow.

It's called 'Managing Expectations'.  I've been down this road many times.

Not necessarily so.  Turn-based wargames cater to an extremely small niche
market.  And in most cases, the small companies that write games to this
niche do a good job.

Your statement is true if the goal of the software company is 'Conquering
the World'.  As long as you're comfortable with a little corner of it, you
can do just fine.
