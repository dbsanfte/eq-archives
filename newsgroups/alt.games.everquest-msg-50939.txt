Beware, the tongue has two edges. ;)

I may be new to this NG, and relatively new to EQ (my highest char is a 25, 
followed by a 15 I never play anymore and an 8 I started a few weeks ago), 
but I am an old hand at USENet in general.

I've learned flamage from the best, and I like to think I do them proud on 
occasion. :)
