Will it help if I tell you I just did Prince last week for an enchanter
with a group and a half, no monk (I was playing my magician since my monk is
on sarnak faction), a wizard puller who was 2-boxing a non-fighting rogue
(also on sarnak faction) to be able to open the door, and a ranger tank?

To be fair, my 61 magician was bringing down the average level of the raid.
