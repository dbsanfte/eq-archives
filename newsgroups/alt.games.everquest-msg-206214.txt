Then you can't have been to many GM events.
Khosh made a pretty fair description of what they turn into.

Legends is full or "ubers" farming by all accounts, I don't think it is what
SOE had in mind.
Shame they couldn't do an RP server with the extra GM's...same content as
normal, FV rule set and then GM's designated to the server to create some
interesting events...Maybe then an event would be worth attending...Of
course that could become the same as any normal server event and be "Kill
the GM" time.

> they need to rename the old servers to the Abandoned.

CS Abandoned, yes, it certainly feels that way sometimes.
