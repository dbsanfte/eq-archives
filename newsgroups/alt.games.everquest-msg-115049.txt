I was under the impression that most plate helms didn't have a graphic on
druids, I know the Custom Cowl of Mortality, Custom Crown of Kromzek Kings,
Custom Frostreaver's Velium Crown and Custom Yelinak Crown (whatever name it
is) were like the only druid plate helms available.

Either that or the Square helm does indeed have plate graphic and I'm
thinking of the Velious Plate textures.
