Not me, most of the players in the game.  I would expect you to know as
much.  Methinks you're just being cantankerous.  You can say it was a poor
assumption on the druid's part, if you wish, I won't argue that.  However,
don't sit here and try to tell me it's no a generally accepted substitue,
when we both know that it is.

You shouldn't need a poll to tell you that.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
