Highly sanitized? Hehe, ok, now give us the dirty version.  :)

Actually, you've hit the nail on the head. TheDownTimeWhine[tm] (your 
check is in the mail) crowd is not interested in any sort of tradeoff for 
any special abilities. In their mind, everyone (more correctly, they) 
should be all powerful by default, rendering practice, effort and 
experience completely unnecessary.

Perhaps I'm being a bit unfair here, but think about it. There must be a 
price to pay for spending all your mana in an all out effort to fry that 
last mob before it destroys your entire party. Likewise, if you decide to 
spend it all on the first of three mobs, you should pay the price. We 
weren't *meant* to be able to mow through wave after wave after wave of 
mobs without being any worse for wear. That was *meant* to be beyond our 
abilities. There *has* to be a limit to our abilities, or it's just 
another mindless zerg fest.

I think we all long for those days of wonder when we ventured into the 
wilds of Norrath with our very first character. Don't bother trying to 
tell me how your first days were full of corpse runs, lost gear and 
getting your asses kicked by rats. If it were so terrible, you wouldn't 
be here arguing with me today. I know *I* was hooked from the first 
evening I spent playing into the wee hours of the morning.

My point here is that, whereas we can never go home again, eliminating or 
even drastically reducing the downtime would be a *big* step in the wrong 
direction.
