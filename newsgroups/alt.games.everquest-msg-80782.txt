Yeah, I know what you mean.  I started a warrior and played him up to lvl
16, I go *sooo* tired of sitting on my ass waiting for my HP to come back, I
quit and started a cleric as well.  Boy, it was great up to about lvl 20 or
maybe 25.  After that, I was just like my warrior again... I have to laugh
at the cruel irony.  Now at lvl 49 all I do is sit on my butt...
