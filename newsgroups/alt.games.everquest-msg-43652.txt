Stonebrunt has decent mobs, but I doubt there are many players around your
level.
My alt is hunting there and is having problems finding groups around his
level (23). The SW corner Burlap camp is very very good for levels 17 to
22/23, but after that the exp is drying up. You need to go for the roaming
mobs or the more northern camps. Both involve traveling through a dangerous
area with lots of wandering reds, plus there usually aren't enough players
of sufficient level to take on a higher camp.

My alt is probably going to South Karana to hunt Kobolds there, or maybe
even to Kunark to LOIO and OT in a few levels.

CT is also a viable option, but there usually aren't many people there so
it's BYOG.

This is from experiences on the Vazaelle server, YMMV.
