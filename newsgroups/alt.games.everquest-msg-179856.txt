France isn't non-committal.  They are saying no.  That sounds like a
committment to me.

Fuck you France with your lazy, arrogant ways always waiting until the end
to see which side to support so you can be the big important savior of the
day every time in some showy and impressive explosion of power which no one
ever expects because you are so completely invisible and no one knows what
you are about but you are always there waiting and riding the bottom of the
world from a seemingly inferior position, but you know that you are always
where you want to be, even though you almost always act like everything is
totally catching you by surprise and that you are completely clueless and
virtually blameless and have no idea what is going on even though you are
the one who caused it to occur indirectly and when the time is right you
will strike, the time is not now but will be, but we will see, for when we
will be free.
