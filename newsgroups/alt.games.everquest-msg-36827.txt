I've made the run numerous times with my warrior, no sow, no invis, no
buffs, never a problem.  My shaman has been attacked by the spiders a few
times, lately, I've been attacking them.  Once Vekis attacked me, but so far
no deaths on that run.  I would advise not turning down the clipping plane
too much, just deal with the lag, at least you can spot the spiders, and
they have a low aggro range.
