Two warriors from our guild while very bored, capped the PoD in
Rivervale.  He was actually easier than the Marshal....probably
because PoD is a level 50 cleric mob who is 100% resistent to all
spells while the Marshal is a level 61/62 warrior guild trainer who is
also 100% immune to all spells...little shit hits kinda hard too.
