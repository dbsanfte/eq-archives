On EMarr, the Reavers are far from permacamped.  Of all the times I have
gone in there, only once have we had to cancel a Reaver raid as they were
camped already.  I used to spend a lot of time in CoM, and more often than
not, there was at most, one other group in there.  Just because it happened
to be camped for raising cash that one time does not make the people doing
so assholes, they can use that money to upgrade their own equipment.  This
is not to say that there are not assholes who do permacamp some things.
