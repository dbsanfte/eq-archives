Update 2/12/2004
-----------------------

Tribute Update
------------------------

The Tribute system as it was released has caused a greater variance in 
favor distribution than was intended.  In order to make the system more 
healthy, fair, and balanced, there will be changes made over two updates -- 
one today and one next week.

The following changes have been made today:

- Favor Maximum:  There will be a maximum limit of 200,000 favor that a 
player character can have available at any time.  If a player has 
accumulated more than 200,000 favor at the time of this change, the 
character will retain its favor, but will not be able to add to it until it 
falls below 200,000.

- Favor Value Adjustments to Items:  Some items have had their favor value 
adjusted to be more appropriate.  For this update, this will not affect the 
favor amount that a player has gained by handing in items that have had 
their favor values adjusted.

For next week's update, we will be adjusting each character's favor amounts 
based on any items that were handed in to Tribute Masters that have had 
their favor values adjusted.

We hope you continue to enjoy the benefits of the Tribute system and Gates 
of Discord.  

In other words:  Play, raid and be merry, for tomorrow we nerf.
