I havent seen that, but today while fighting a skeleton (grey con,
but tough) I had pretty solid aggro when it turned on my shaman
partner saying (literally, through the speakers) something like
'Its time to die, Priest, make your peace!'


This was only *After* casting of wards, etc, but it seemed an
obviously 'healer focused' change rather than merely built aggro.
