Bah.  Get Harmony of Nature and learn how to use it.  So you don't
get an AtomicFlyswatter(tm) as a level 5 spell anymore.  You've
gained DoT stacking just in case you'd like to do something besides
quad-kiting, and even your NewAndImprovedNerfFlyswatter(tm) will do
the job of the old one so long as you develop a minimum of skill
with it.  I'll bravely assume that experience playing a Monk equates
to an ability to play skillfully on your part, though I suppose that
might be a stretch.
