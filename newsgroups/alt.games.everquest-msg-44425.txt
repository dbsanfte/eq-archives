Ouch.  Well, I know you're against paying for it, but I use www.giganews.com
and pay $7.95/mo.  I know of no free news servers that work with independent
readers like OE and Agent but they may exist.  Someone asked that question a
few months back and did not receive a "yep, here!" answer.

Before I changed to giganews I was borrowing a work Earthlink account to
access Usenet but that's probably against some TOS or EULA so I'm not
recommending it.

Sooo, free internet, $7.95 for giga and dump AOL...you'll end up SAVING
money.  Of course, if you download a lot of porn or programs giga will
probably end up costing you more, but I seriously doubt if I come anywhere
near my monthly allowance.
