I would like create a character to play on the test server to preview any 
changes that VI plans for the main servers.  

I need a soloable character that can get around fairly well.  I decided to 
create a Druid since he can sow and port to various areas around the world.

However, I read that in dungeons, Druids are handicapped, so I'm thinking 
about making a magician for dungeon delving side of things.

Just want to get some opinions on whether I really need to make the 
magician or not.  Are druids that bad in dungeons that I need to worry 
about not being able to check any out with him?
