Yes, it does. You're violating a contact, you're breaking laws, and
you're breaking your word. It makes you dishonest, which makes you a
bad person. The fact others do it doesn't make it okay. You're not
going to get out of a speeding ticket by telling the cop "everyone
else speeds".

It would be slander if what I was saying is false. Look it up, skippy.
Everything I am saying is true. The EULA is a contract and it is just
as binding as it would be were it written down on paper ( EULAs have
been supported as such in court, and the only cases where they've been
thrown out are in cases where the terms would have been thrown out on
a paper contract as well ). It's also about the honesty issue: You
claim you're not a dishonest person. However, every time you played
the game you told SOE that you agree not to sell your account ( By
clicking the button that says you agree to the terms in which that one
is contained ). You're breaking your word by attempting to sell the
account now. That makes you dishonest. And, yes, they do have the
right to tell you that you can't sell the account. Why? Because it's
not really yours. As I said before, "your" account simple represents
rented space on their servers. Just as you can't sell your apartment
lease to someone else, you can't sell your account on SOE's servers.
