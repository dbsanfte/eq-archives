In Fact, keep all your stats maxed. My Paladin twink is now 53 and there are
plenty of attainable weapons for Paladins with incredible stats.  For
Blunting, The Rod of Faith is incredible at 24/32 1HB Pal only.  For 2 Hand
Blunting, Granite Facegrinder is intense, 29 36 2HB all tank classes.  For
piercing, those War Lances from DN are incredible, ranging from 30/40 to
32/37.  1 Hand Slashing brings you great wepons like the Halcyon Broadsword
18/25 and the Darkmetal Falchion  23/28.  Finally, there is 2HS which will
bring you your Epic 35/40 with 150 DD stun proc.  Keep them all maxed, it
won't be easy, but it's well worth it.
