I'm sure we can all distinguish between EQ-spawned neologisms like "sow" 
or fashionable expressions like "keke" or "hihi" (my understanding is 
that these were popular amongst Korean players in the beginning, and then 
caught on), and pure lazyness. Things like "plz" and "u" are simple, 
unadulterated lazyness, and things like "no" for "know" are worse, they 
are lazy *and* confusing.
