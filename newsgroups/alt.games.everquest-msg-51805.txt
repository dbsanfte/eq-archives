    I argue otherwise because it's not fact. When the Shawl quests went into
EQ, all the casters went out and learned the tradeskills. Why? Because a
"good enough" item was available to make for themselves. If the items are
available, and people feel the reward is appropriate for the time spent,
they will skill up.

    Then in a setting like DAoC, where equipment is level-oriented, what
level-appropriate player will buy the stuff? If it's too expensive to make,
it's going to REALLY be too expensive to buy.

    Stop. Demand decreases as the server demographic changes. My server is
getting to the 50% over level 50 area - that's half the server that doesn't
want banded, or patchwork. So it doesn't make a bit of difference HOW much
is floating out there, they don't want it.

    No, there would not be. Every player would learn the skills needed to
make their own gear, as players want to depend on other players as little as
possible. At best you'd get a weak barter economy, and only if tradeskills
were limited as in DAoC (can't be a master of all). The price for that
barter economy is the constant diversion of players away from the endgame
(PvP) to farm cash to make more gear that breaks at random in combat.
Doesn't sound like fun.

    Sigh, because demand is low because half the damn server has better.
Which they camped at their level. And even if all their gear rotted they
still don't want your POS because it doesn't suit the needs they have at
their level. So to sell the item you need to approach people who, surprise
surprise, because of their lower level have less cash. If the REAL question
is "why do items drop that are only good for a level 10, and items for a
level 60, that require the same time investment to get", I imagine the
answer has something to do with the REAL time investment required to get a
level 60 vs. a level 10 item.

    It sounds like what you want is a severe nerfing of the PvE game, to
make a few button-clickers cheerful as they solo their way through their
chosen tradeskill. Again, EQ is biased against soloists of all stripes. The
model for EQ tradeskills is "go and adventure for the drops needed to make
the foozzle", because they have balanced the PvE game to be biased against
soloists.

    Doesn't stop them from camping it, does it? Or making it for a_twink01?
Things like Warrens Loot Code and having ALL drops come off
level-appropriate mobs are the ways to stop that problem. And as we saw, the
player base is against TLC.

    Yes, but what is that time line? HOW many players per server times HOW
many visible slots times three gems per piece (possibly times two, once for
Thurg and once for Sky/Kael). That's one hell of a long time - the game will
be long gone before everyone has Velious quest armour.

    Hardly. You seem to think that ten hours at a level 10 camp is equal to
ten hours at a level 50 camp. Sorry, but to even GET to the level 50 camp
requires a ton of time invested. Saying "I spent ten hours here, so this
item MUST be valuable" is also silly because, as I point out, VI isn't good
at placing items in level-appropriate camps.

>> And you
>> still haven't shown the widget to be useful.
>
>It isn't useful.  That's my point!

    Then it's a poor point. People don't camp item X unless item X IS useful
to someone for something. It's more useful to camp cash and XP if the items
available are junk. And given that mob HPs, damage output, and resists have
risen with each expansion (at a constant mob level) what is "junk" has moved
upwards with time.

>Items deteriorate in DAoC so players will need to replace their supply,

    NO. Only a level 50 (max level in DAoC, yes?) needs to REPLACE his gear.
Most players need to IMPROVE their gear with time, whether it becomes
outmoded or rots. How will they accomplish this? They'll sell their old gear
(if it survived) to someone lower than themselves, and MAKE the improvement.
Why? Because they don't want to rely on a tradeskiller for needed gear. It
came up over and over in the TLC debate - I don't want to have to rely on
someone else to do something for me if I can do it myself. And tradeskills
are doable by anyone.

>and
>price is dictated by merchants who sell similar equipment yet at a lower
>quality for a price which is set 33% higher than the cost of the materials.

    You think the MERCHANT price will do anything other than set a ceiling
on prices? Heh. Once I'm a Grandmaster Weaponsmith, I can sell the low-end
stuff at expectation cost (cost including failures) to drive others out of
the business. And I will - I make my money on the high-end stuff that
hopefully not many others can make, and which need to be replaced by those
level 50 characters.

>Trade skill items are better than those found on mobs, with exceptions

    Which will rot if used and can only be quested up once, so trade skill
items are (long-term) better than all items in game. Using the "timeline"
you used earlier. 8)

>To boot, all equipment is level dependant such that

    Emphasis added by me. I was unaware DAoC had this - so your "pure
blacksmith" that you want doesn't even exist in DAoC? You MUST adventure to
gain levels to be able to make the gear the server will want over time,
correct?

>Because there is a steady demand and a built in profit margin

    Sigh, unless I've misread there's no built-in profit margin. The lowest
price that will be charged is the vendor buyback price of an item. There is
NOTHING stopping a Grandmaster Smith from charging at expectation cost to
price smiths of lesser skill out of the market. Given that each realm at
present only has two places where /auctions can take place, it would be very
hard to unseat these monopolistic smiths. The limited /auction is a blessing
and a curse here - a blessing in that anyone who did want to be a salesman
would have a captive audience, including some of the lower-levels that
aren't caught in EC in EQ. A curse in that all the competition is there,
too.

    Um, how will time make more items trade-only? If anything, as item
prices are deflated fewer items become trade-only.

    Tee hee, that's impossible. One is valued against the other.

    And I disagree. The EQ economy seems to be working fine: if I want an
item, in general I can find it and terms can be arranged in either plat or
in trade to get that item. That's all I want out of an economy. Trade skills
work as an enhancement of a mob's drop table at higher levels: if you have
tradeskill X, then when item Y drops from a mob you have a Z% chance of
making it into item Q which (hopefully) has utility. Cash is removed from
the system mostly by spell reagents.

    Agreed.

    Agreed.

>This is because of an economy that does not support deterioration of

    No. This is because the top-end items that can be made with tradeskills
do NOT compare with the top-end drops in the game. All that matters for a
tradeskill to be a going concern, item decay or not, is that those top-end
items be competitive. They are not, BY DESIGN. The best gear in EQ comes off
mobs, and if you want it you can't sit in a store and right-click to get
it - you need to go face the toughest challenges in game to get it. No
reward (best items in game) without risk (toughest environmental challenge
in game).

    Agreed. By design. Not by accident.
