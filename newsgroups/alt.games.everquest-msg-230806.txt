Sure, situationally you need to use one line or the other, but at least 
so far, most mobs can be hit just as easily by magic or fire... malosini 
takes down both resists the same amount, too.

I can see where you'd want to do a seperate compare to see which is the 
best fire line, the best bolt line, the best magic line, so when you 
need to use one or the other you can pick the best.

But I still think generally, for day to day use, the key question is 
which spell does the most damage per mana, and alternately, whats the 
best spell or combination of spells to do absolute best burst damage, in 
case I need to burn something down NOW and to hell with most mana 
efficient.  (death is hell on mana efficiency)

Amusingly I think for a while Scars of Sigil was the answer to the "burn 
it to the ground" question.  Been a while though, maybe I'm thinking 
some other question.

Splendid
