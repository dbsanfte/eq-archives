Clementsmith did a good job of explaining the types, but I'd also like to
add that you have to take into account your operating system. I believe
Windows 98 & Me can only handle 512MB before becoming unstable and suffering
random crashes, 2K can take twice (maybe more) that amount, and I would
imagine XP can take everything you can throw at it. Hopefully someone can
correct me if Im wrong on any of this, I just know that I can't go over 512
without upgrading my OS :)
