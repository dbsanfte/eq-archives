I just hit lvl 20 tonight (yey!), and several people told me that I 
should go to LOIO. 

I've also been told that its a dangerous journey for a good character, so 
can anyone tell me a fairly safe way to get there? I know that I have to 
take the Barrel Barge from Oasis, but I have no idea where to go from 
there.

Thanks!
