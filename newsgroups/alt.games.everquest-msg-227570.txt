The Bazaar is an area with player run vendors. It is good for making pp for
lower level characters since you can sell things like silk, foraged items,
pelts, for high prices. It is also good for equiping characters since you
can often find suitible items at decent prices.

If you didn't have the newbie armor quests last time you played, you may
want to look into them. The items you get are good for at least 20 levels.

There are shared slots now including pp. What I would suggest is you go back
to your original server and play there a bit. The way to do it is to get one
good item that more then one of your characters can use. As an example,
there is a centi short sword that often sells for ~100 pp in the Bazaar.
What you do is buy that weapon and share it between your rogue, ranger,
bard, warrior, what have you. Ditto for your casters, buy a Stein of Moggok
or quest it so you can use it with your magician, enchanter, ...

Ease of gaining levels to 10 is very good now. Only character I have ever
deleted was a DE SK years ago. I started an Ogre SK a couple of months back
to see what the SK thing is like and it was a cake walk to level 10<compared
to years ago>. No exp loss on death, great newbie armor, twinked with a
sword/shield, harm touch resets on death so he actually could use harm touch
every 5-10 minutes to level 10.
