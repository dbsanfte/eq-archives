I know they did some upgrading but I never saw mention of this. It seems
that new items are dropping from monsters. A friend and I were collecting
ingredients and stuff to sell at the bazaar in the newbie area of Everfrost
last night. I killed a decaying skeleton and he dropped a pair of leather
boots with an AC of 4 (only 1 better than the 5 AC rhino boots I bought
recently) that sold for 1 PP. In this area, you're luck to sell anything you
find for 1 gold! They also started dropping wooden shields and parrying
daggers. Wooly spiderlings dropped some sort of bone and a thorax (both no
drop). Many of the goblins started carrying torches. Just odd!
