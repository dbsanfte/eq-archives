The guild in question doesn't have a name that you'd immediately associate
with something in game, such as 'Warrior' - in fact I'm amazed that I can't
gain a /who all on them. It matters not though, this was an enquiry about
how to find a guild reference number.

The frustrating thing about not being able to /who all the guild in question
(and no, I won't name the guild) is that any prospective application cannot
see how many players the guild has on-line. Yes, LoY brought a wonderful
guild tool, but that tool is only usable once you're guilded.

Regards,

Stevie.
