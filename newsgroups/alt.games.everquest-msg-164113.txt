9/16 (epic fist) with 13 Damage Bonus is 19.38 MN/s
15/20 with a 13 Damage Bonus is 21.50 MN/s

At 77% Dual Wield (i.e. with Ambidex for a Monk) at L65
DWing 9/16 in both hands is 28.38 MN/sec
DWing, 15/20 in both hands is 33.05 MN/sex
Tranquil Staff 29/30 is 32.00 MN/sec

So comparing the primary hand the L65 fist is exactly 10.97% better than
using the Epic.  For that you lose 100hp hand slot item, 40% self haste,
40 ATK self buff (40 ATK is good for about 6% more damage).

DW the 15/20 L65 fist is exactly 3.28% better than a Tranquil Staff.

Now that is *not* a significant benefit.  Not for the tremendous loss of
Hp, most likely AC and Resists  Not to mention that non-uberguild monks
may have equivalent to 9/16 weapons with stats - they wont, of course,
have better.
