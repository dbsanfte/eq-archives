All my characters are on EMarr.  I don't know where the hangout is,
though judging from where I see my guildies (most of whom are in the
70+ range) I'd guess everyone's in Buried Sea zones working on faction
and/or trying to get whatever neat new toys are available at that level.

The population in the hot zones varies; given the hours I play I often
have them to myself, but when I'm there earlier in the evening I do see
at least a few groups hunting.  Alas, sometimes what I see is someone
getting PLed, which makes it hard for level-appropriate characters to
do much.  I wish people would be more considerate about not wiping out
zones where others are trying to hunt.

p.s.: My SK recently dinged 58 and has the AAs saved up for his steed.
One level to go! :-)  And since I bought the Anniversary Edition I get
the barding, too!  (Am I right that that's just eye candy?  No actual
effect on the horse?)
