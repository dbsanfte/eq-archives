Oh lord....STFU, you idiot. 

You sound hysterical. 

No one is saying that EQ isn't copyrighted to Sony...

The argument would be whether IGE/Yantis is violating any IP law. 

A couple of precedents have been set lately, that could set the stage
for Sony to lose if they pressed the issue. 

While Sony owns the game, who owns the time invested in acquiring
items and plat in the virtual world? And what real life value is
vested in those items and money? 

These are rhetorical questions, bud. So do us all a favor and don't
bother trying to answer them 

Law Professors here in the US haven't sorted that out, and I doubt a
rabid half-wit like yourself could do better than some of the finest
legal minds at Stanford University...

Oh, and here's another tidbit for ya, moron...
Just because something is stated in a EULA, doesn't mean that its
legally sound...

Lotsa times you see warranty exclusions listed along with the user
agreements you click OK to, but just because they're there doesn't
mean you've given up any rights. Lotsa things vary from State to
State, and some don't apply at all.
