If anyone with a 3D RAGE IIC AGP video card (or similar RAGE product) can get
Everquest to work, please get in contact with me.  

I've been scouring the net for weeks and all I've managed to find are vague
notes on random message boards from people with the same card and OS (win98). 
I've found evidence of people who can play, but nobody I can contact for help.

Running Everquest tells me: No 3d Devices found
Running DxDiag for DirectX9.0a tells me:
Hardware accelerated Direct3D 8+ is not available because the display driver
does not support it.  You may be able to get a newer driver from the hardware
manufacturer.

-ATI.com (maker of RAGE product) doesn't have any new drivers for this after
1999   or so.
-driverguide.com and other major driver databases turn up the same stuff

From that info it would sound like this card is completely incompatible with
Everquest's new requirements.  BUT I've run across a couple of posts from
people with this same video card, who can get the game to work!  A couple of
posts on Alakhazam's Everquest site and also a few other random messages across
the net from my 3 weeks of searching.  The posts didn't provide any information
though, other than that others have been successful.  

So I'm hoping someone here has a RAGE product by ATI or is an expert on video
cards and DirectX.  Please reply to my post or send me an email at
Krockinit@aol.com
