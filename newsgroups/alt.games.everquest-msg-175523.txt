I've been buying Peridots from the brother and sister vendors in Shadowhaven
opposite the bazaar zone because I have ally faction with them, but from
what I've heard they have high prices even with high faction and high
charisma.  I tend to pay 10pp 5gp a piece for them and I'm wondering a
better place to go.  I have amiable faction in Thurg and of course hometown
is good I think.  I can (with steins) muster up 140 CHA, so what faction
level will give me the best price with a vendor and where is a fairly
convenient place to get them.  Thanks to all the fellow Clerics that may
answer.
