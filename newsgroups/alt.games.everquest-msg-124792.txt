While your MT concept of a list sounds as close to workable as anything
I've heard, this is the part where it still looks like it falls apart.
I'm sure if I'm currently number three on the list, I'll just be
THRILLED that I'm now going to wait a *minimum* of another month for my
shot because the asshole in the number one slot can't get his shit
together and be online when "his" ragefire spawns. And who get's the FFA
shot at Rage? Somebody else on the list who then just vacates their
slot? What if it's somebody not even ON your list? How doe the rest of
the mighty listholders react to that?
