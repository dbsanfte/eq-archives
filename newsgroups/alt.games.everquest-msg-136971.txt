Ahhh nothing like the smell of fresh faux news in the morning, sort of
reminds me of mornings on the farm growing up, and besides, its always
good to start the day off with a giggle.  Now can you explain who is
being forced to do what there?  Even though it wasn't really a news site
the story still clearly comes through that the central authority of a
private group is the one doing the forcing and the only ones they are
forcing are their own satellite groups.  So you now believe that private
groups shouldn't be allowed to set their own policies?  If so I'd like
you also to campaign for outside control of religious groups, political
groups and the local Lions club.  

If this policy is an issue for communities they will  no longer support
the group with contributions nor will they send their children there,
both by choice.  If funding drops below needed levels the group will
either cease to exist or be forced by the will of its supporters to
rethink its position.  Society holds the keys to the kingdom with its
checkbook so far as charitable groups  go, I rather doubt this policy
choice by a private organization will force people  into anything.  Of
course I have the advantage of not relying on yellow journalists or JAG
to do my thinking for me.
