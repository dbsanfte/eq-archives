Nope.  Well, at least if they don't up the damage efficiency
of Manaburn.

You're using an incorrect assumption.  Manaburn is powerful in
that it can use all the wizard's mana in one big unresistable
burst of damage.  That burst isn't as efficient as a wizard's
normal nukes, however.  A wizard would do more damage by using
their normal line of spells.

The current way Manaburn is used on raids is to have the tank
get aggro, Manaburn, mod rod mana back, and then cast as normal.
Now they can't do that due to the mod rod nerf.  Now it's a
choice between casting an inefficient Manaburn and medding back
mana before being able to cast with some mod rods thrown in to
help or simply casting normal spells and using mod rods
throughout the process.

Manaburn will still help marginal raids, especially ones where
a small guild can't take out a target without the extra *burst*
DPS.  But it's going to be almost useless on most raids.

FT should stay around the same price, I'd guess, because there
is still a hard cap (15 FT total.)   And it's doubtful they'll
remove the restrictions on the CHeal spells because it'd just
defeat what they're trying to do.
