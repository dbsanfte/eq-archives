Since nobody has covered this properly as of last time I downloaded:
Half-elves in the EQ/D&D version of the word do not exist with
Tolkien. The mating of humans and elves is possible, and their
children will have both elven and human traits, but will be counted
amongst the human race. However, the story in Elrond's family is that
the mixed children are given a choice of being counted amongst the
humans or amongst the elves. Elrond chose to be counted as an elf,
while his brother Elros chose to be counted as a human (yes, he
presumably still had pointy ears :) )

As for Arwen, she is the child of an elf and an elf with a human
daddy, so she is counted as an elf. Then, she falls in love with a
human. In couplings like that, the elf is allowed to choose the Fate
of Men (aka. die and go to some afterlife which the elves don't have,
it seems they just sit around and wait to be reincarnated instead of
going to 'heaven') rather than face eternity alone after the partner
dies. This only happens in Twue Wuv cases - if an elf and a human have
a brief drunken fling, they'll remain elf and human and maybe have a
human halfelf child with elven features.

I remember being confused by the exact nature of Elrond myself when I
first read the book :)
