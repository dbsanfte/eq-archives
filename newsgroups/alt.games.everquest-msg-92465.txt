Aye, meant to say once mid 40's you can go into karnors. I did well there
when I first went in at lvl 43 and didnt have much trouble with mezzes

You can easily get a group in dreads at 35 because groups accept you to be
in group just for clarity and hasting. You dont have to do much and may feel
like a free loader but if they happy to have you then all is well. You can
assist with slows by tashing so shammy can slow easier or use your own slow
and the nullify magic etc for spiders with DMG shields helps. But you can
stay in OT for couple more lvls.

Yes you can make some money in Frontier Mountains but if you want to exp
quickly I would suggest skipping it or maybe do 1-2 levels there.

Lot of grief in the LOIO>FM>OT zones cos a lot of idiots haven't been
filtered out. Once in Dreads people are a lot better

HHK is very good exp but a disgustingly bad mannered zone and I avoided it
like the plague of newbie morons it is. SK is nice at spires or Aviak town
but Splitpaw itself is a nasty higher lvl Crushbone of trains and idiots

If you want to go to Velious then get to lvl 30 and get a group killing snow
cougars in Iceclad or move to crystal caverns and pick up a group there.
