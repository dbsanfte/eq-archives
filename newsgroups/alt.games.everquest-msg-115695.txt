 I don't think anyone has bothered to go after TFA since the change on
our server. I wonder if that's going to be a permanent thing. Not that
it matters much since the named are up on server start which puts them
out of our timezone.

 Other than motg/proggy it is a waste of time, in my opinion. It's good
for guilds who would find priceless an upgrade, but most guilds capable
of killing first broods probably have better weapons already. Unless
they've just farmed Zlandicar for keys since he's rather gimpy.
