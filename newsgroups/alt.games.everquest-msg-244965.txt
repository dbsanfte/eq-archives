A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the
name Ben Sisson <ilkhanikeDIESPAM@yahoo.ca>:

>Vervain (wood elf druid, Povar): 31

Oops fucked up this one. It's been several years.

Vervain (wood elf druid, Brell): 31

Created when Brells first came out, which predated Kunark. As one of
the first new servers to come up after release Brell reflected the
realities (or how people perceived it at least) of the day and was
absolutely jampacked with druids and necros. A pretty typical group in
Cazic as I drew close to 30 was one melee, one caster, and four farkin
druids.

That pretty much soured me on Brell. :-) Went to the next new server
to come out after that: Tribunal.
