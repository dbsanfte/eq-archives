Yeah.  The broker buys it on the order.  Of course time of transfer of money
would have to be more thoroughly thought out, but it's certainly doable.  I
suppose you could insist on full payment of broker fee and price, up front,
in which case, you would always want to take delivery.  In fact, the avenue
for delivery could be to your bank account.  There are lots of ways to do
it.  The key point is that it would effectively decentralize the bazaar,
making it an unnoticable small performance hit in each zone rather than an
annoyingly huge hit in one zone.

I'm sure you are right.  I wandered in once, died in seconds, and decided it
was a little above my level 12 solo wizard. ;-)
