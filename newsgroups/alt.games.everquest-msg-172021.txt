I was part of that conversation but there was no clear agreement that this
was really happening.  I agree also that KEI in it's current form is
imbalanced, but like you enjoy it's benefits.  The strongest argument
against KEI is that casters with KEI can solo and now have no need of tanks,
thus the melee classes are not benefitting from KEI as much as casters are.
I don't think this is true at all, I see just as many casters grouping as I
used to.

In fact shortly after that discussion I was once again in Velks with three
casters, a Necro, Wizard and Shaman (me).  In a 5-6 hour period a number of
tanks cycled in and out of the group, but the casters remained.  We were
constantly looking for tanks because they kept leaving for various reasons.
Granted this was an over 30 level group, but I don't think it really changes
all that much.

The conversation started when a 32 level chanter was looking for a place to
hunt and was told that he/she would have a hard time finding a group now
that KEI has made them obsolete.  The truth is I have never been in a group
where a chanter was not welcome at any level, either pre or post KEI.
Chanters are not always available and players have learned to make-do and
KEI is one of the ways they do it. During the same period in Velks, two more
shamans showed up LFG, a couple of Monks, an SK, two Druids, a Necro and in
5-6 hours, only one cleric and NO enchanters at all.

The fact that many players do not understand the benefits of other classes
has nothing to do with KEI.  As you said you didn't fully understand what a
rogue could do until  you played one.  This is true of many players and
classes.  I was once in a group in which a particularly arrogant and
obnoxious player who did not want a necro in the group because he said they
are terrible in groups.  One of our group members had played two necros to
60th level on two different servers and really let him have it.

Pick up groups are a mixed bag at any level and you never know what you are
getting.  You could get a player that has played for 3+ years and is
experienced in a wide variety of classes and is now levelling an
uber-twinked all, or you could get a newbie player who has exp'd up as
quickly as possible in all the common zones and at 50+ still knows little
about other classes and what they can do.  For my part I would never presume
to tell another player how to play his/her class expecially if I have never
played that class. Either way, this kind of short-sightedness has little to
do with the use or abuse of KEI and was happening long before it came into
the picture.
