I recently found my char is a positioin where it was necessary to get
levitation in order to decend into a vertical shaft, (the entance to
the crystal caverens in EW). The crar was at best extremely inapt
trying to decend and I don't know whether it could assend if required,
didn't have to, since it was teleported out.

What is the  key stroke sequence for decending and accending?
