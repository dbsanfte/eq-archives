  1.  Hide does NOT clear the hate list -- if something has aggroed
      on you, you're always "visible" to it no matter how much you
      might try to make yourself unseeable.  Casting invis won't
      help either.  Apparently it now has your scent or something.

  2.  Hide will hide you from both live AND undead creatures.
      Every other form of invis works on only one or the other.

  3.  Hide can be "cast" instantly, and does not have to happen to be
      one of the 8 spells you currently have memmed.

  4.  Hide never wears off if you're just sitting there, no matter
      how much time passes.

For these reasons, Hide is FAR from useless.  Hotkey it, and you can
make yourself reliably, indefinitely invisible to both live and undead
at a moment's notice.  It's great for making sure you stay safe while
meditating, or especially while running off to the kitchen to make
yourself a sandwich (or answering the phone/heading off to the bathroom
for an indefinite period).
