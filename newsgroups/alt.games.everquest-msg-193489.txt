Standard is what you can afford, and that varies by level.  I started out
giving 20p and now I'm up to 35p.  What they really hate is when they get
nothing.  The other day some enchanter was saying donation of 100p required
because of all the bums.  She got so much flack she went away and
simultaneously the nexus chanter also left for a few hours.  They came back
not out of the goodness of their hearts but because they like the money they
do make.  I think if the money is good enough to keep 2 chanters in the
nexus and 1 in pok then the money must be fair.  Otherwise they wouldn't do
it.
