I'd like to see every bit of fossil fuel in the world used only to 
produce things like plastic which are recyclable, instead of burned as 
fuel.  Unless there's a great artificial plastic on the horizon, we are 
burning something we can't ever get back, instead of storing it up in 
land fills or reusing it so we don't have to get more out of the ground.

Nuclear power may be a better stopgap, as there seems to be a potential 
for near limitless power if we can get fusion up and running... as an 
aside, wind, water, and solar are all nuclear fusion really, and that 
power plant should be running for another 5 billion years.  Using up the 
more limited fissionables isn't such a crime if it keeps us focused on 
nuclear technologies so we eventually arrive at fusion.

But a hybrid car does have both a gasoline engine and a electric 
motor/generator.  Odd as it seems I've heard there's a hybrid V8 coming 
out next year, SUV probably, don't recall specifics.

Ordinary electric cars aren't necessarily the great panacea people think 
they are, that electricity still has to be generated, so unless you 
couple a move to electric with a massive effort to move to renewable 
resources, they still burn fossil fuels (or uranium which is also non 
renewable... do we have decent breeder reactors yet, or better fusion?). 
  Same is true of hydrogen, someone has to make the hydrogen.  Worst 
part is, the second law of thermodynamics (it is the second isn't it) 
says that every time you move energy from one place to another you waste 
some of it as heat, so now your power plant has to be more efficient not 
only than a gasoline car, but then a gasoline car plus the inherant 
inefficiency of generating the alternative.

Nice thing about the hybrid idea currently being used is that it takes 
some energy that ordinary cars waste as heat (braking) and converts it 
into stored energy to use later.  Inefficiently, of course, but a lot 
better than 0% use.

I was hot about alcohol for a while (reportedly almost all vehicles in 
Brazil run off alcohol generated from their massive sugar crop) but I've 
heard that making alcohol usable as fuel is so energy consuming it 
actually uses more fossil fuel to produce than you save by not using it 
in your car.

Its all a muddle... but its pretty clear to me that the best way to 
start out is to work on using as little fossil fuel as we can manage, 
while looking for ways to substitute a renewable resource instead (if 
what I heard about alcohol is wrong, for example, aren't we currently 
paying farmers NOT to grow corn and other ethanol producing crops? 
Brazil isn't doing that)
