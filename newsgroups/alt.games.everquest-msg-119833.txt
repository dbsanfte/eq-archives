Nah, just the average player in a raiding guild, at least for a
needed class.   Or just a critical class in an XP group, like a
porter in an XP group just after the drop-off in the Hole.  Or
the healer in a single-group without a porter fighting its way
out of a dungeon.  Maybe you've probably never faced the "well,
if XXX has to go we need to call this off"-type of peer pressure
or ever been deep inside Seb or Chardok and needed to help
get a group out safely before logging;  many of us have.

It probably could have been worded better but it's a pretty fair
statement to point out that part of Everquest for *most* players
involves some times when leaving the game isn't just a Gate and
/camp away.
