When is that not true for anyone, including people who
claim (incorrectly) to not have faith?

Take the "all paths are correct, as long as they lead to
the same destination" crowd:  Do they not believe that
their underlying assumption is correct?  Do they not
believe that anyone who assumes differently is wrong?
Their big 'difference' is they don't see another path as
harmful;  it's *still* not the right path, in their opinion.

The same is true for the "you live, you die, it's over" crowd,
of course. Or the "bible-thumpers."  And everyone else, too.

Why would anyone keep following a path they don't
believe is right?
