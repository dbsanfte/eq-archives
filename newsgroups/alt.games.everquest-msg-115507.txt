A helpful hotkey from the Enchanter boards:

/pause 5, /pet back off
/pause 5, /pet back off
/pause 5, /pet back off
/pause 5, /pet back off
/pet back off

Enchanters using charmed pets have the curse/blessing of being the one
supposed to be  controlling the unruly pet, and being the one who is
supposed to be mezzing all the adds. 

If the friggin pet keeps breaking mez, at least the friggin enchanter
doesn't yell at me. :-)
