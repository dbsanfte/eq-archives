}"Isrs" is also easier to type. But you don't use that, why not?

Well, I, for one, had to think considerably longer to figure out what 
'Isrs' was supposed to mean than 'Pali'.  At first, I thought it was 
'losers'.  Personally, I'd rather not use the term Pali, but I will if I'm 
tired and/or it makes the sentence scan better.  I wonder why it is that I 
find 'Israeli' much easier to spell than 'Palestinian'...

I don't think most who would use the term 'Pali' mean it as an insult.  I 
think that those who do, would probably also consider 'Palestinian' to be 
an insult.  If there are Palestinians here who object to the term, it 
would be good to hear from you, so that I may change my behaviour if it 
offends.
