So I'm hanging out in PoN on the nasty PK server Sullon Zek. PoN is
basically an evil dominated zone on SZ, and during the course of the
evening a few neuts showed up to try and pk and cause havoc. During
the course of their escapades, somebody in the zone shouts out
something in a role-played style. No sooner is this uttered than the
one of the neut PK's starts shouting, telling the person to stop
roleplaying, or move to the FV server. What is up with that crap? Why
do the anti-roleplayers get off on mocking and dictating how to play
to the roleplayers? Personally, I think the neut PK was roleplaying an
anti-social little psycho, but I wasn't about to tell him how to play
the game he is paying for. Why do these dweebs think that that basic
courtesy does not apply to them?

If you don't want to roleplay, fine, nobody is forcing you to do so.
But neither do you little powergamer shitheads have a right to tell
other people how to play.
