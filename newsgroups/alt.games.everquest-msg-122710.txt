The wizard can also;

get you to kunark (DL port, EJ Port, SF Port)
get you to LOIO (invis, lev)
scout the pull site with eye of zomm
snare the mobs
use cancel magic line to remove mob buffs (don't think this
    matters with bloodgills but if there are any casters, mobs
    are generally buffed up when you first break a camp)
root
evac
bind monk in nearby Cabalis (or FV or FM)
bind near the fight spot
teleport off to sell, fetch supplies, gate back
port the party out at the end of the day
or TL individuals out when they want to leave
change tactics and kill 4 bloodgills at a time instead of one

Sit and nuke wizards are like sit and heal clerics.  Boring and
a bit lacking in actual contribution to the group (although I
will admit that a cleric's healing is less wimpy than a wizards'
single target nuking)

SNARE sits quietly on that list but is IMO job one in any
group, snared mobs are far easier to kill and far less dangerous
to the group, with few exceptions every mob should be snared.
Your monk buddy isn't going to be able to do that... possibly
bloodgills are easy enough that its not necessary but that just
means you picked childishly simple prey that isn't a fair test
of your utility.

ROOT also sits quietly on the list, but thats root adds, root
for aggro control, root so monk can back off and bind wounds...

Evac is probably of limited utility in your example, but its of
primary importance in many real dungeon crawls, I always try
to bring a wizard or druid along on just about any dungeon
action, as they have both snare and EVAC.

I didn't put stun on the list due to my ignorance, but don't
wizards have stuns spells? Stun can be very important,
especially with the recent changes to casters making their
spell selection more of a threat.

Having never played a wizard, I'd be willing to wager
there are actually more spell lines tucked away in there that
I'm not familiar with that extend the utility of the class still
further.

PS comparing yourself to a monk has to be a hard row
to hoe, thats one heck of a powerful class played well.
But try having him pull 5, you kill 4 while he kills his one,
and then he can pull singles till you are FM.  Is he capable
of soloing a total of 4 and then heal to full while you kill
4 and then med to full?
