    I'm a little surprised a high-level bard hasn't used that Highsun song,
plus tracking, to nail down the exact spawn point of Quillmane. Then, kill a
few PHs to get a handle on the spawn time and what else is on the table.
Finally, let one PH live and follow its wander path while Invis so you could
quickly figure out what mob in SK was the PH after zoning in. You'd now have
a method for guildmate mages to follow to allow you to zone in and start
"camping" Quillmane effectively.
