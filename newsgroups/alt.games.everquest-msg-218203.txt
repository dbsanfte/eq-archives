Work with the ratio of the two. The delay is the time units between each
swing and the damage isjust that. You can work out the damage rate using
the ratio of the two to work out damage per second.

Things get a bit more complex when deciding which weapon to use to limit
aggro and so on but for a beginners just divide the delay figure by the
damage figure and whichever gives the LOWEST result is the better one
