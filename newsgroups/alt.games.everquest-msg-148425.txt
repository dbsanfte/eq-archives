Until the highest levels of equipment, rangers just can't get enough
AC to make a difference; like wizards, they do a lot of damage,
and try not to get aggro.  For most rangers, for most encounters, the
AC of a ranger is irrelevant, and HP only a bit less so.

If dex means more procs, then it means more damage.  Damage is
what I want a ranger for.  If I want AC and HP, I'll get a tank,
not a damage dealer.

Oddly, up at the highest levels, you see an effective cap on AC,
low enough that rangers can hit it.  Warriors walk around with
600 more AC than rangers, proportional just like always... but
instead of that 40% extra AC making the difference between
actual damage mitigation and nothing (as it does in the sub 1000
AC part of the game) it ends up making no noticable difference
at all.  On the other hand, by this level of game, CHeal is the
principle heal of choice, and the relative difference in max HP
totals tends to become a factor almost as telling as the AC
difference was at lower levels.  While a ranger Can serve
as primary tank at high levels, he's still much more likely to
be a damage dealer... and again I'd rather have him proc
twice as often as I would have him take a tenth less damage
when he gets aggro.

Exceptions to this would be mobs with a high riposte rate
(AC... but heck, stand behind the mob), mobs with high DS (HP)
and AE mobs (HP HP HP), for those encounters, heck, take
off your dex gear and put on your backup AC/HP suit... just
like I carry around or bank resist gear.
