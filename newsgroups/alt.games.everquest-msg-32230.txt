Excellent post, only one more thing to add.

Sometimes if you have a chanter trying to mez something and getting beat on,
you should ignore it, in case the mez gets off, so that you don't break mez
almost immediatly.  Unless the chanter tells you to stop attacking stuff
they're mezzing though, it's generally best to go ahead and do it.  (this
situation happened to me more than once, heh)
