There is a damage cap at 10 and one at 20.  Before level 10, having weapon
damage greater than 10 doesn't help.  Before level 20, having weapon damage
greater than 20 doesn't help.  There *might* be a damage cap for weapons of
30+ damage up to level 30, which would be logical, but I've not bothered to
check it.  Not many weapons that qualify, and the classes that would use
them probably prefer to have bash available.  =)

I put a fungi tunic on any twink that can wear it up through the 30s at
least.  Nowadays I load up on healing, speed, clarity potions too.  I'm
curious at what level I'll actually run into downtime with a twink these
days.

I got nothing better to do with the platinum in my bank anyway, and don't
even need to spend all that much because I've twinked many generations of
characters.  I've got half a dozen fungi tunics scattered around, all looted
years ago, and other such things.

I tend to lose interest in twinks right around 51-54.  This is obvious when
one looks at my stable of nearly twenty 50+ characters.  =)

Third option is your force isn't strong enough and you still manage to win. 
This is the only option you have when you are "bleeding edge" as you won't
have geared up as much as the people that come along an expansion or two
later.  I look at monks that are currently raiding Time and they have
*double* the hitpoints I had when I first walked in.

Too lazy to even list my main character, though I don't make it hard to
figure out.  =)
