I entered the /veteran command and then examined the AA screen.
The hot key button was grayed out, and I wasn't able to train any of the 
items.
Are the veteran items tied to signing up for a one-year subscription 
extension (offered initially during the April 11 through May 11 time frame)?
Or do you just get the veteran benefits without the need to subscribe 
for the year?
Thanks,
