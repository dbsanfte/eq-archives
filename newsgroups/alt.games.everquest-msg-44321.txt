I'm afraid I have to disagree with your analyisis. The fact that I, as well
as dozens of other people had no problem before the zone crash fix indicates
that it is a problem on Verant's side. The notion that some network routes
to EQ servers work OK and others don't somehow "proves" it's the ISP's
problems is nonsense. These network routes are all likely operating with
their design specifications, as evidenced by the lack of problems executing
any other network functions - Verant's network code simply does not function
correctly within certain regions of the network performance envelope.

There are many aspects to network programming that could cause this,
especially if the EQ servers are asynchronous multi-tasking processes. There
are timing, sequencing, and handshaking issues with UDP, anti-hacking code,
firewall, proxie, virus sniffers. and a plethora of other speed bumps on the
way to succesfully communicating with TCP/UDP. Verant's job is not an easy
one, considering the immense range of performance capabilities that exist in
the thousands of client machines that they claim to be able to communicate
with. Dismissing  legitimate user complaints out of hand simply because
Verant's code is unable to accommodate certain network performance regimes
is not an appropriate method of customer service.
