Not to burst your bubble, but a 22 druid helping a 14th druid would not be
called powerlevelling.  Now, if you were being helped by a 50+ druid with a
24pt damage shield, that'd be powerlevelling.  Anyway, it won't do much for
teaching you how to play the game (and a druid starts coming alive at level
14), but your defense skill will be pretty good :)
