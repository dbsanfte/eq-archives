Agreed. A 40% gross margin seems excellent for most companies, but in the case of 
Sony in regards to EverQuest, what products are they selling? Gross profit 
doesn't include operating expenses and in this case the overwhelming majority of 
expenses for EverQuest *are* operating expenses. Customer service, server 
maintenance, bandwidth, ongoing programming, ect. are *all* operating expenses.

Their expenses included in figuring that gross profit would be such things as 
manufacturing, R&D, advertising, programming (for new releases, *not* ongoing R&D 
for current releases), and sales.

I'd be curious to see an Annual Report for this venture. Granted it is 
profitable, $5 million a month in revenues can't be too bad; but this 40% "gross 
profit margin" thing people throw around is quite misleading. I'd like to see 
what things are included within each category to come up with each figure. I know 
for a fact they don't have anywhere near a 40% net profit margin, however.
