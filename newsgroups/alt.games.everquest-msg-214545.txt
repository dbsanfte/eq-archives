LOL, I only have solstice earring as my FT item...working on shawl 
quests though. I have decent gear thans to some good quests [emerald 
dragonscale tunic being my best item...and i use my donals bracer to 
pacify to split...] but realistically, most areas I hunt you have to be 
careful where you hunt at, and even with KEI and beastcrack i cant pull 
a lot of DB mobs , do the root/nuke/ routine, and heal myself up 
afterwards without at least a good 5 minutes of downtime to get my mana 
back...and a lot of areas I hunt have a lot of trains or idiots 
training...I would rather get my exp in a group where all i have to do 
is med heal and buff.

Stun and bash...hm, i use a soulripper. I hit for 1 to about 35 points 
unless the lifetap procs. Even with spell haste most casting mobs 
without pets are still able to kick my behind, and with a pet, forget 
it. I have had a wimpy spider hitting on me regularly for 35+ damage per 
thwack, an even with a decent ac and temperence on me i cant take that 
for long. Yup, i am a wimp...

What part of me not being in a guild didnt sink in? When I deguilded, 
all the people I helped get epiced, BOUGHT horses or spells for gratis, 
power leveled or used to regularly hunt with decided i was the wicked 
b!tch of the east and will do nothing with me. It sucks when you go from 
being in a guild to pretty much alone except for about 5 people...2 of 
whom are eurpean and 6 hours ahead of you in time, 1 in the same time 
zone, and 2 in the pacific time zone and 3 hours after you...Did I 
mention one in europe is military and is now going to be incommunicado 
for the next 3 months? One of the west coasties is now back in school 
and plays occasional evenings and is in a guild that raids on weekends? 
  I am going to bed when the other leftcoastian is finally logging into 
the game, the europeans are almost ready to get up for work...and he 
only plays one day on weekends...

I am NOT going to do a pick up group for chardok...I am NOT in a guild 
that will stop off and kick the king or ragefire for me on the way to a 
  raid.

Lets see, no guild, no epic. My game hubby and I agree we are sick of 
guild politics and really dont want to reguild without a lot more 
research into different guilds...pretty much until I establish a new 
group of friends through grouping with them, no epic for this little 
cleric. I made 1 new acquaintance this past weekend doing a LDoN 
adventure, we will see if it develops into anything.

I never said it wasnt viable, i said it sucked for the clerics. It is 
getting to where you almost HAVE to be in a guild to get the clicky 
stick...or have lots of friends...that happen to end up in the game at 
teh same time.

So here i sit, scepter and first orb in hand...patiently waiting.
