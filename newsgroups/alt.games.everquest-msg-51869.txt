You will get different opinions on this. At 53, I usually use
enthrall. Depending on the situation, I may change up to a
higher-duration mez. The reason for using enthrall: low mana cost,
fast recast time. It doesn't last too long, but this is a plus if I
decide to charm something mezzed. I don't have to wait too long before
it breaks.
