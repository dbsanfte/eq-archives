This lvl50 monk was hunting in solb when info came that there were some
guys in lavastorm organising a naggy raid. Having never been
participated in such an event, I was very excited and went to join them
without a second thought.

We waited for 3 hours for the group to finially gather, had about 40
ppl, but it wasn't well balanced, it had overwhelming melee power
include 5 - 6 monks 3 warriors and a lot of hybrid tanks, one the backup
side, we had many druids and shamans, also about 3 enchanters. However
we only got 1 single cleric and  1 single wizzard. I had a bad feeling
about this right from the beginning. but Oh well...

It was a suprise that we cleared the way to naggy so smoothly, no FG can
stand our dog pile for more than 20 sec. we reached naggy's room with no
one died in battle.( of course, some one ran into lava but that doesn't
count )

So, After buffing up the leader anouced his plan: Group 1 and 2, include
the leader himself, would charge in to surround naggy, and the rest
would wait at gate for his instruction.

So we waited outside the gate watching them charge naggy bravly, and the
door closed in front of me when all of them passed though. So I had no
idea how they started the battle. Anyway one of my group member
disobeyed the leader and went in with them, I saw his health bar droping
like someone has casted a complete unheal on him.

We were waiting for the leader's shout for backup and it didn't look
like he had a chance, instead someone else did on his behalf, So all of
us went into the battle.

The fist thing I knew was there were corspes on the group, and naggy had
about 80% hp,
The second, I lost control of myself ( hmmm why that fearless disipline
did work )
The third, when I regained my control, one more of my group members was
dead.

I started to attack him. and he aggroed on me after I landed about 3
wacks and a kick on him, I died in 5 seconds.

Result: TPW with naggy on 50%

Hehe , I had a good time though, and some nice memory, but they dont
come at a cheap price -- cost me 170pp to buy a coffin.
