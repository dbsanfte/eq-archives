    We're well-trained rats. We know that there'll be better items later in
the expansion, so we skip junk early on no matter how good it may look. You
could put the crappy, player-hated encounters in the final zone, but then
players won't buy the next expansion. That last part is recent, by the way -
WoW is giving players an alternative.

    Do you want to be one of the healers that gets removed from the
encounter just 'cause? The final encounter in Tacvi involves a boss that can
only be damaged by one particular charmed pet. Do you have any idea how our
DPS types, like rogues, monks, wizards, and magicians, feel about the final
fight? We have them sit in a room a few rooms away so they don't get killed
by the AE, and tell them when the fight is over. Does that sound the least
bit engaging to you? Why play a game like that?

    I have yet to see a mob that made healers move that didn't have a
trivial, easy-to-counter damage output. Because they can't have kickass DPS
and force healers, who have to be stationary, to move. Aten, mini-Aten, Aten
blobs in VT, Saryrn in Torment, all killed first try because they just can't
put out the sort of DPS that challenges someone and still be beatable when
the healers are forced to move.

    No, I'm saying the raid shouldn't require reaction from everyone to be
successful, it should require participation to be successful. I can tell Bob
the Magician to move to the left when the mob gets near 60% health
beforehand, and he can do that whenever he's comfortable doing it prior to
60%. If Bob has to react in a random manner, any bit of lag will screw Bob,
and hence the raid. It's the difference between having a firm scripted strat
versus just reacting within a very loose framework.

    You're stating that "not wanting to be hit with random elements" is the
same as "not wanting to be challenged". The same logic would equate "not
wanting electric shocks through the keyboard during events" with "not
wanting to be challenged". Raid players want challenges, and get them, just
not the type you desire.

    The event leads to my cloak, arguably the best caster cloak in game.
It's still not worth it.

    Easy being a function of execution, but yes, pretty much. The challenge
is in deconstructing the encounter, based on clues gained by trying the
encounter and not prior knowledge, and thereafter in execution.

    Yes. And it's the game I have.

    Well, if you call some of the multi-stage strategies we implement
"simple", then yes. ;-)

    Actually, we love thought. Forethought, to be exact. We want to have to
work our asses off to figure out the puzzle, but not have the pieces change
every time we take it out of the box.
