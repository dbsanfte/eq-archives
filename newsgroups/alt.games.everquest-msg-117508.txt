Could be a bug, but a fortunate one for me. I got killed at 1:00 AM Pacific
time and logged out. Next day the Rez timer was right where I left it.

I have read of bugs in "/camp desktop" that let the timer continue to run,
but camping normally stops the rez timer (at least for me the last time I
died).

Also, Rez timer's run if you are logged on your account - not necessarily
playing the character who needs rez.
