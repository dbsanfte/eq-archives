No, but if the server count is low it lets me know several things...

1) Don't log on with my rogue, as since there are 600 people on
    chances are low there is a group in Siren's Grotto.

2) I can't connect, but apparantly 2200 other people can.  Time
    to call my ISP.

3) I can't connect , but it's 11 pm EST and apparantly only 41
    people can connect...time to call the guide in chat "misguided"
    if he says "Contact your ISP."

As somebody else had said earlier...I don't really give a rat's
ass about the total number of players.  I just want to know
whether to know whether the massive lag on my computer is
because of then brand new 1500 customers on my server over
the normal load or whether that last patch completely screwed
the game up.

I've tried really hard to see VI's point...but I can't.  Heck, I'd
be happy to know the server number of my own individual
server at the character login screen instead of the server login.
#'s 2 and 3 above were more common two years ago, but VI
has done a good job of clearing much of that up.  But deciding
which character to play before I log in (into the game, not onto
a server) can save me 15 minutes of fruitless shouting or running
to an adjacent zone when I only have an hour and a half to play
that night anyways.
