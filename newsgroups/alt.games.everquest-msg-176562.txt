Celestial The Queen
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - H. Wheels - J. Bouchard - )

I'm out of my place I'm out of my mind
Totally bent in the big time
There's no place for one of my kind
Scorn behind shades I don't care anyway

Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen

Her world turns around
In my ear the sound of laughter
Swift descent
Dark and mute dreams deceive

The world turns around me
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen

She came from the dark she came from a dream
All leather and chains the rising queen
Born into the night born into the spotlight
She spread her wings and then she was gone

Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen

The world turns around
In my head the fury laughter
Swift ascent
And then forever it meant nothing

The world turns around me
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen
