I do get reimbursed for coffins and I have said something about the EEs and
got told I only needed to use one so I should "Take one for the team" lol.

Anyway, I was out of EEs last night and everyone got squashed (except two
monks, sk, and me) on a golem run in PoF and I was fresh out of EE but I
carry regular emeralds incase i have to sacrifice someone.  Well guild was a
bit upset that I didnt have any and nobody that was FD was up for a sac so
they had to CR the hard way heh.

I agree that gem reimbursement should happen sometimes but not every time
aego is cast.  A pickup group is an example where the cleric should fund
their own gems but on a raid they should be reimbursed.
