Warriors need groups.  So do knights.  So does every class in the game that
wants to experience the game the way it was intended to be played.  That's
the point here, how can things be balanced so that groups won't prefer one
tank over another to the point of "every group MUST have this class"?  Right
now the situation you described is spot on:  warriors passed over for groups
in favor of knights.  No one suggested warriors should solo, just the
opposite.  Have you read the thread at all?

Druids got Complete Heals some time ago.  Clerics were hardly made obselete.
