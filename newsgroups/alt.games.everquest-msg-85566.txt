    Go to the High Keep area. At level 20 you can still slum in groups out
in the Pass, you're big enough to get in Lookout/Guard groups in the Keep,
and once you gain a level or two (I think I started at around 22) you can
solo Osargen all day (6 minute spawn rogue-type mob, greens at 31, plus
faction to NFP guards and minus faction to evil FP casters and FP SK guild).
You may want to go somewhere else at 24, but really you can ride Osargen to
31 if you can stand killing the same mob that many times. I may ride him up
to 31 just so I can make the transition to the Thurg mines a bit easier.
