One nice side effect of the "tag it and it's yours" mode is that
people are often pretty helpful in WoW.  There isn't any issue of
KS-ing... if someone is fighting and you think they are in trouble,
you just  jump and and help them, no hassle.

Reminds me of an incident very early in my EQ career, fighting on the
"orc hill" outside of kelethin. My very first char.   Mobs must have
been level 6 or 7.  One guy was fighting an orc and going down about
the same rate as the orc, so I stepped over to help.  He told me to
back off, and someone else on the hill said "Let him die".  So we
stood back, and when he had about 10% health he started begging for
someone to help him.  We just stood and watched the orc toast him.
Very satisfying.
