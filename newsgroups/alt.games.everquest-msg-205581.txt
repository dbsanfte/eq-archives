How disgraceful!  Are you sure they were shamans and not shadr00ds?  I can
barely pin my shaman husband down from using all his nice aggro-happy
spells.

"Dear, let me have aggro."

"No Foxeye, you are just succumbing to all those stereotypes that say that
a caster can't take hits."

"Dear, you have 3 on you and you are at 50% and dropping. Maybe you should
let me pull."

"I'm fine!  A shaman who has over 50% health isn't doing his job right
anyways."

Actually, I'm exaggurating...he only does that when we are going on
greenie bashing sessions.  I'm not sure if switching to our alts so he can
be tank is a good thing (get it out of his system) or bad thing (he'll
decide he likes it too much).

Are you sure they weren't just getting resisted a lot?

This thinking is become a trend lately I hear, mostly because it's finally
sinking in that enchanter slow lands with fewer resists (and BST too I
hear, though the "evidence" on that is sketchy).  Maybe the shaman on your
raid have just been hit by a wave of self-pity and wonder if it's worth
trying anymore. :P
