I'm pretty sure that it's not 'illegal' because it is so hard to trace, and
GMs don't want to play Cop.

To the best of your ability. The original poster didn't even try.

When you find $20 in a library book, you might assume that someone was using
it a temporary bookmark (a retarded one, but the scenario is very possible)
and simply forgot about it.

When finding $20 on a table, I think it could be obvious that it's meant for
someone else. If you're in a restaurant, it's probably a very gracious tip.
If you're in a home, it could be set out to pay for something. The
possibilities can be endless.

When I see the little satchels on the ground, I presume there is an intended
recipient. In fact, it's rather obvious there is.

You think Chris is lying? Surely possible. After all, he claims to have
bought a FBSS for someone, perhaps as a way of condoning what he did. He
goes from being a rotten thief to a philanthropist. -Or have I misunderstood
you?
