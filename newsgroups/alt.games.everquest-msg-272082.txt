Dont get me started on Paladins using Stuns with a DD component
and then telling the group "low on mana".   :)
Usually its a very bad idea to tell other players how to play their
classes,so I keep my mouth shut,a lot of Pallies seem to think they
are a DPS class,maybe Don should put it in the FAQ that their job
is to chain cast Stuns and keep a finger on the taunt button.  :)
