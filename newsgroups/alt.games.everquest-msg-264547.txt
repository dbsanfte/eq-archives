If this week's patch doesn't solve most of the problems, this is going 
to be brutal. Last night lag in Antonica was as bad as I have ever 
seen it in any game. Spells were taking longer than a count of 10+ to 
fire off. Many of us just logged off as it was impossible to play.

This morning it was not bad at all, but mornings tend to have light 
traffic. Beta 1 was taken down, so we'll see what it's like when it 
comes back up. /shudder to think what it would be like with maybe 
thousands in Antonica.....
