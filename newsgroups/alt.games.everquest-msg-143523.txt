yep. That's how we do them. Low MR, not too many HP, and if you can keep
them feared they are cake. The very cool part is that none of the
"regular" groups, if they show up there, *ever* want to pull them. So
they leave them and they multiply. I've shown up there and found about
70% chromos flitting around and very few of the others until we clean
them out. Probably my favorite mob there, possibly tied with the
wyverns. The EoS and Lava rock drops make up for any PITA factor on
these mobs with their dispells and poisons.

I just *LOVE* it when that happens! LOL! I've not had nearly the ratio
you have, but I get it often enough and it always gives me a chuckle.
Fear lands after that and I'm running up behind to nuke it again,
thinking "Nice job, chowderhead. Flunk out of Chromodrac High, did we?"
