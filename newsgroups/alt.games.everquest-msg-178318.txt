Y'know, I have a REALLY hard time keeping my mouth shut when people are 
feeling down.  I don't comfort people well, and I do make people laugh 
very easily.  Therefore, my first instinct is to want to make them 
laugh, at least.  I have learned the hard way that there is a time when, 
as they say, if you can't say anything nice, you shouldn't be saying 
anything at all.
