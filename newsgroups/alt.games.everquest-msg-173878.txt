It is in our nature as humans to blame everyone else but ourselves.

Because we are all hot to be the first to get to that mob we know has been
reset with the patch and hope like hell that we can get the loot and have
our charaters saved, and that the slight roll back won't affect us.

patch crashes and spent the next 10 hours pulling guildies out of the tower.
Try getting to the top of ToFS with all your keys sitting on your corpse at
