Get out of LOIO as soon as you can.  You don't need to stay there.  If you
have Luclin you can solo in Paludal caverns or group in Netherbian Lair or
Marus Seru.  When you hit 30, which will be fast if you go anywhere on
Luclin, go to Dawnshroud.  That zone was made for soloing Rangers.  Fear the
zelniaks and beat on them while they run off.

If you don't have Luclin there is always Stonebrunt, on Odus.  No one even
knows this zone exists.  Even people in the warrens will argue that there is
no other way out of the warrens.  You can kill kobolds at the camp near the
entrance but I think they are already green to you.  Or you can fear the
pandas and gorillas.  Do not go walkabout without camo on there, not fun to
be jumped by a cuddly panda bear cub in the middle of nowhere.  Track helps
out alot in that zone.  If you are gonna spend any time there, get the
details on the wakizashi quest, may as well do it while you are there.  I
currently use my wakizashi (proc comes in handy soloing) but it's not gonna
be good later in a raid situation when I don't want taunt.  Try not to
attack the snakes they hit harder than you think.

Good luck.
