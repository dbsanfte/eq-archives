When did they decide it was not feasible?  Cite your source, please.

It sounds like you're pulling wild ass guesses out of your ass.

How do you know they don't have the computational resources?  After
all, at any given time, most of the mobs in a zone are completely
idle, and likely take very, very little CPU time, depending on how
the AI was programmed, exactly.

I'll put forth an alternative theory: They just plain decided it
wasn't worth the effort to program it.  As EverQuest grew and
server side hardware got faster and cheaper, they decided it was
something players didn't care much about anyway.

ANY feature has the potential to be exploited.  You throw around the
word "exploit" as if having mobs obey walls and structures is not
possible due to exploits.  Quit guessing out of your ass.

: more, tho they do still attack thru doors and cast spells thru walls.

Mobs obey walls in dungeons?!  Oh no!  Exploits!  Computational
resources!  Heeeelp!
