I don't recall ever saying you had to pay attention to them. Also, I very
seriously doubt I can change anyone's mind in the first place.

As for calling it trolling... I suppose you could. However, I prefer to
consider it as thinking. I like to learn, think, write, and read. So I plan
on posting to this thread because it based on the topic of my interest. If
someone is willing to have an intelligent series of posts with me, they're
more than welcome to. In fact, this thread is even labeled as OT so that the
audience is kept to a minimum for those that do not care to read my
opinions. Now if I was posting to the "YALP 2.1" topic, I could perfectly
understand your complaint.
