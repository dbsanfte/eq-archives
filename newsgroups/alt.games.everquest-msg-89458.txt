What would be cool, would be to make them basically a rogue/enchanter
hybrid -- the "mystical powers of stealth and trickery" part of
enchanter, not "makes items and uses NPCs as pets" part.

It might look something like:

Level 10: Sneak, Pick Lock
Level 12: Backstab, Meditate, Pick Pocket
Level 15: Sense Traps
Level 17: Dual wield
Level 18: Safe Fall
Level 20: Parry, Hide
Level 24: Apply Poison
Level 26: Instill Doubt
Level 30: Disarm Trap, Make Poison
Level 35: Disarm
Level 45: Riposte

(Higher-level spells following the same basic pattern)

Armor types: same as rogue

Races: combining the restrictions of rogue and enchanter, that leaves
only humans, dark elves. and gnomes. Half-elves seem reasonable to me,
but then I've never understood why they're not allowed to be
enchanters, anyway.

Disciplines: no idea.
