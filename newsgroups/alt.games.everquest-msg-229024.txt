Re/ the ATI problem with the targeting ring...

They EQUALIZED your lack of targeting ring by taking away mine, which was
just fine until the patch.

The new find graphics SUCK!  Gonna have to actually find out where the heck
my bank is now.  Forget about it in foriegn cities.  The little spray of
floating whatevers give no real clue to which direction to go, unlike the
old trail which was clear when trying to run to locations.

Looks like I'm gonna be falling out of the tree at Kelethin again -
fortunately, I have made enough levels to survive.

Other effects I like - snare shows roots coming out of the ground and
thistlecoat is perfect - just like the name implies...

just put find back and return my targeting ring and my ranger won't have to
swear vengence against the capricious gods of Norrath...
