Ah, but that's a different matter. It's not rude to glance over what
someone's wearing as you pass them in the street. It's not rude to go
as far as to take the time to look at the logo on their shirt, shoes,
and jeans. Some try to compare it to rummaging through and looking at
the tag inside the shirt, etc, but I disagree there, the reason being
an inspect only shows the names of items.

Why can we see equipment under robes when inspecting, then? Design
limitation. Really makes no difference, though. Turn off your inspect
messages, and you never even have to know you've been inspected. Why
care? It has absolutely zero effect on you. You don't even have to
stop to click "decline".

Now, what IS rude as far as inspecting goes is walking up to someone,
inspecting, asking the stats on everything they're wearing, and trying
to pressure them into selling you the shirt off their back, so to
speak.
