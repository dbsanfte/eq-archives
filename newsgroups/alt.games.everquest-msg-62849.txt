Wrong.

Crystalline silk does not need to be enchanted. It requires store-
bought silver thread and a coldain tanner's kit, has AC similar to raw
silk and some + save magic, and is all/all. Trivials range from 102 to
131, iirc.
Also, I have never sold a single piece of it to another player, and if
someone wanted a piece, I wouldn't charge 10-30pp according to how
many swatches the piece required. However, as I approach 131, I am
going to make a crystalline silk tunic for my mage and see if it has a
robe pattern of some sorts.
