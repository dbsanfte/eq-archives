They are combining two things in this change that don't have to be combined:

1. Making it so that doing a specific recipie doesn't require as much
tedious clicking and mousing, and

2. Making it convenient to find out what you need for a recipie.

It might make more sense to not combine these.  For #1, the simplest
solution I can think of offhand would be to add a "autofill" checkbox to
tradeskill containers.  If you check this box, when you do a combine, the
following would happen:

    1. The product, if you succeeded, would automatically go into inventory.

    2. The tradeskill container automatically refills from your inventory
    with whatever ingrediants were consumed.

If they still want #2, they could make it so you can click on a known
recipie to automatically load the tradeskill container.  It might be
interesting to add a tradeskill book, kind of like a spell book.  The
tradeskill book could contain a list of all the standard recipies, and
places to scribe new recipies.  This would allow for three kinds of
recipies:

    1. The standard known recipies.  Everyone can do these.

    2. Undiscovered recipies that everyone can do, once they know the
    ingredients.  Make it so trying on of these adds it to your tradeskill
    book.

    3. A new type of recipie, that only works if you have it in your book.
    These could be obtained by quests, or mobs could drop recipie scrolls
    that you scribe, much like mob-dropped spells.
