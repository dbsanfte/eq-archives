It's not my job to care about him. ShowEQ is so blatently obvious for Verant
to detect... if he loses his account, it only hurts him. So why do you give
a damn?

Actually, if you took a moment to think, perhaps you could understand that
pointing him in the direction of a bannable 3rd party program would be a
good test of character. In other words, by giving him the information he
needs to do break the rules, you can see if he's worth even having in the EQ
community by testing his honour.

Of course, that crossed your mind, right? After all, you're so much faster
and calculating than I am...
