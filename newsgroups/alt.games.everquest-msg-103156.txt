	They're obnoxious on several levels.  From a game-balance perspective,
they were give far too good starting stats (better than Wood Elves, and they
were pretty gross already), *and* Halflings are the only race that gets an
experience BONUS (for reasons that have never been explained).  From a
world-design perspective they simply don't make sense; the race has neither
the temperment nor the culture to train Rangers.

	Dissent is by no means universal, but what there is of it is extremely
virulent.
