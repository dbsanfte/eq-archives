*cackle* I like that idea.

Brings up a question though.  Are there any cities where there's 
something that *will* be able to smack you around if you're high level 
enough to be killing guards at random?  Like, the Commons.  I'd LOVE to 
go kill them at some point when I'm high level, just to make them pay 
for stealing my kills so often.  Then again, I don't want to be level 
60, smack down a guard, then find out there's some level 600 guard in 
Freeport that takes offense to my actions.
