BW wouldn't be too bad.  The giant fort, for example, is often empty
on my server these days.  Also several spots in the zone where you can
setup without horrendous add problems (MANY spots just the opposite
though).

Chardok entry or exit tunnels would be worth a look as well.  Seems to
be a decent ZEM there.  As a shaman the "root it, dot it and send in
Dogdog" method would probably work well there.
