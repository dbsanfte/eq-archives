You can train in Befallen all the way to 200, maybe higher (not checked on
that one).  The EFP door requires 122 or better to open.  If you are below
that level, you will never get a skill increase.

Pickpockets is one of the few skills that you can increase on a green.  So,
yes.

ROFL--I did the exact same thing when I was around 20th.

The utility of this has been debated.  Many feel that the moment where the
swap takes place results in lost attacks.  As your weapons improve, this
will become a non-issue as, eventually, you'll have faster weapons that
provide decent stab damage.

Don't get fixated on the idea of huge backstabs, though.  A BS only accounts
for about 35-40% of our damage.  I'd rather have a 10/20 weapon for stabs
than a 15/60.

Excellent.  I am always glad to encourage roguelings who are making the
effort to learn the class.
Be sure to swing by the Safehouse forums.  There is a wealth of information
in the Library and in the Training Studion [read the FAQ first! =) ]
