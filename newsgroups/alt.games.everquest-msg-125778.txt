Yeah I'm sure he used those drivers too :/

I don't think this matters.

This would be normal under load in any system (except for direct 
analogue CD audio). You could try increasing the process priority of 
Winamp though.

Both myself and my friend have Boston speakers for digital output. Not 
sure of the model number, but they are just two satellite speakers and 
one bass.

Interesting about the default output of the Audigy. This could be the 
cause behind the problems my friend experienced. I believe he tried both 
analogue and digital outputs (analogue into his hifi, digital into his 
digital boston speakers) but I am not definite. He had no sound rather 
than massive speaker overdrive.

I like the music in Everquest, since I think it adds a lot to the 
atmosphere of the game, so to me having music is an important factor. 
The EAX in EQ is good (although I have noticed in some situations with 
EAX on you won't hear sound effects if the mobs are a little too far 
away, strange). When running through tunnels you hear echos, and sound 
effects really do sound like they are coming from behind, infront etc. 
Its not terribly important but nice to have.
