The extra few seconds of regen while casting is nice, but isn't remotely 
the "whole benefit". Over a typical fight its a couple ticks worth of 
mana extra from counting as sitting... so it adds maybe 100 mana over a 
multiminute fight - if that. Nice, but nothing to get *that* excited 
about.

The biggest benefit of the mount is that you don't have to sit. Sitting 
adds to your aggro. And sitting means you take maximum damage from any 
hit.
