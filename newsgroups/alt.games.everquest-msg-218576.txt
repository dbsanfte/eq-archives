Compassion tainted by economics.. a dangerous mix. Steven Hawking should 
never have been born because his wheelchair was expensive. How does that 
make you look?

If we just sterilized everyone with genes for 'scary hereditary disease 
X', we could wipe it out in a single generation, and save a bundle on 
research, treatment, and care. Nice. Now everyone...Please report to the 
nearest testing centre...and wear clean undies just in case.
