I've had this question asked with some frequency, and never found it 
insulting or unnerving.  I don't recall anyone ever turning me down 
after getting an answer, either when I was in my no bazaar all newbie 
quest outfit, nor later when I was in my "I inherited 500K worth of gear 
off someone who quit" outfit.

I've also been in the position where I'm forming a group, and I ask this 
question a lot.

What I want to know is, are you going to tank, or do I need to look for 
someone else to fill that role.

When joining a group, one of the first questions I'm likely to ask is 
"am I the MT?"  because if I'm not I often won't bother getting 
temp/Aego/Virtue, and it makes a difference which gear I wear.  I 
imagine that asking this question causes whoever invited me to poll the 
other people he has coming and try to answer it.

Now I have to admit, a berzerker is an odd duck; not a plate class, but 
of the non plates, probably the closest thing you'll come to a MT; at 
the same time, probably the worst thing you'll come by for DPS, but a 
damn sight better DPS than most plate class people of comperable level 
(which probably also stops being the case in a few more levels.)

Over 55 or so, this gradually stops being the case; rather than a medium 
tank, it appears that we get pushed into the DPS category and its one we 
aren't all that good at.

But my point is, its much more relevant to ask a berserker his hp/ac, 
because its harder to tell just by looking at his class what exactly 
he's good for.  And its much less likely that a berserker will be turned 
down for the group if he's not up to MT standards, because he's still 
pretty decent DPS.

At my level, I have a different question; Are the mobs stunnable?  If 
they are, I can tank them, I'm in good gear (for droppable gear) and can 
rely on keeping the mob stunned part of the time to make up the 
difference in mitigation between me and a warrior.  If they aren't, as 
is the case more and more often as I level up, then I take a beating 
about as well as a ranger.

A warrior is good for one thing, and in most cases just looking at his 
level will tell you whether he can do that one thing or not, so perhaps 
when -you- get asked your hp/ac, its because they are looking for you to 
do something the average warrior your level can't, but they can't find a 
higher level one, and are wondering if you are so well geared they can 
get away with using you instead.  When I get asked the same question, 
its more likely they are wondering just what the hell a 'zerker is, and 
what they should do with me!
