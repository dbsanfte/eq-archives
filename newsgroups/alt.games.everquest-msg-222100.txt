I'm not accusing you of anything, just trying to explain that the
apparant conflict is because the two statements were about two
different topics.

Similarly "four is the answer" to "what is two plus two" and
"four is not the answer" to "what is two plus three" are not
contradictory, despite the fact that "four is the answer" seems
to be the opposite of "four is not the answer".
