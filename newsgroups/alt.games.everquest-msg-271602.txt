Hammers are better than Intel's chip - the price parity is because AMD can't
make enough processors.  When they get another fab or 2 going, the prices
will drop and it will be the good old AMD we are used to.

And AMD may have the market cornered right now, but all Intel has to do is
turn on the 64 bit mode on their prescotts, and AMD's monopoly will be gone.

Intel has already released that absolutely ridiculous 1 Ghz FSB in their
Extreme Edition processors.
