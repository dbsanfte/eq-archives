Actually, I'm thinking GM's are starting to have some fun...  I was hanging
out in EC with my mage (a lev 9 newbie, LOL), when I started getting

"You are out of food"
"You are out of food"
"You are out of food"

<about a 1 min pause>
"You have plenty of food."
"~~burp~~"

Similar messages with water, as well...  And this was shortly before getting
whacked by "a Tiny Snake"... In EC!!  (actually *kicked* by 'a Tiny Snake'
for 25 points of damage.)  Never did see the snake...

The next night, I hopped on with my mage and got in an orc group...  And
that's when a *very* tiny skeleton named "Skellytoes" kept whacking me...
He'd tag me for 27 or so points of damage (causing my pet to aggro), then
run off, with my pet in tow...  By the time I realized what was going on, my
pet was way out of range for the /pet back off command, and shortly
thereafter died... I summoned 5 pets that night because of Skellytoes...
very irritating...
