I did the heart spiders for a while, can easily kill all the spiders in both
camps and twiddle my thumbs waiting on repop.  Then I got Track,
and went to EK... while theres also a little thumb twiddling there,
with track I was able to get about 10 times as many silks per hour
as I did off the hearts, with practically no added risk (there are
a couple Hill Giants that could be a surprise... on the other hand
at least they are exp!)

While I'm not getting real exp in EK, my track is going up which is
exp of a sort...

Yep, they do.  The Hunting Guide I saw before was released pre-Kunark
though, as I said it was only for 9 to 50... there were no 51 to 60's in the
game!  Ancient history that.. but the web being what it is I'm hoping
that page is still out there somewhere floating around.  If there are
Kunark spider spots those would be helpful too...perhaps we should
try and compile the page all over again.
