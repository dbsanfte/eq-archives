I would suggest instead that you came across a Necro that is either
inexperienced in PvP, or does not have all of his level 12 spells yet.
Probably the latter; Necros are actually fairly nasty in PvP if the player
is any good at all.

Necro pets tend to cancel each other out most of the time. I'm guessing that
he did not have his level 12 pet spell; if he had, the level 12 pet should
have made quick work of your level 4 one, and still had plenty of time to
come stomp a hole in you if you were snared. Your pet should always be the
first spell you acquire at a given spell rank.

Readiness is half the battle in PvP. The other half is gear. Despite what
some will tell you(especially on Rallos Zek, where I've played for 4.5
years), raw skill actually has very little to do with PvP success in this
game.

He was most likely using Clinging Darkness(level 4) and doesn't have
Engulfing(level 12)yet, if he cast it on you 3 times. At that level, 1 or 2
casts of Engulfing and a Heat Blood should have taken care of you. That
would have been my MO at that level, anyhow.

The Darkness line is made expressly for fear kiting(which is the Necro's
bread and butter), and really has no other purpose. It does very little
damage compared to other spells in the Necro's book.

When you're talking permanent death, anything beats dying. No shame there.

You'd have died a normal PvE death. and left a corpse, depending on the
Discord server rules.
