Just seems odd, given my necro hunted them at one point and FD worked
just fine for her. The spell and skill FD work the same except one is
manaless, zero casting time, and uninterruptable.

On a side note, I think necros/SKs should get a perk in how their FD
works because of all the drawbacks. I say if they can get the spell
off through being beaten on, it should never give the "fallen to the
ground" message. Period. In terms of "realism", it's a spell to create
the death simulation whereas the monk skill is a non-magical effort to
mimic death.
