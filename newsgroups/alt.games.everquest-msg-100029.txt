I've done this kind of thing a few times with my Druid... mainly with Griffs
in NK when Grimfeather was showing up on track. It's a good way of
controlling exactly WHERE a fear-kite goes when you're worried about adds,
instead of chasing across the zone and hoping your target doesn't cross
something else's agro radius. Sometimes the fear sends the critter off in
directions you'd prefer it didn't... which is why I've switched to
root-dotting for times when I want a critter to move where I want him...
dropping a nuke on the mobs head means I can usually break the root when *I*
want it broken. :o)
