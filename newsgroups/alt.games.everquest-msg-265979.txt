How so?  Haven't got past 10 yet, but it sure was easy to 10.

Before the Heroic Opportunity change:

    Target mob.
    Static Pulse.
    Lightning. (or whatever it is called)
    Lightning.
    Lightning.
    if ( mob was yellow )
        Lightning.
        Lightning.
    Check for loot

After the Heroic Opportunity change:

    Same as above, except after the Static Pulse, throw in the
    thing that allows starting an HO chain.

If I can't find a mob that will come single, then start with rooting (I
forget the name of the spell) one, and then finish off the other, then back
to the first.

For particularly tough mobs, root and Static Pulse (or Static Pulse and then
root), and stand back and let the Static Pulse DOT work a while.

Just doing quests in various Freeport zones and in the newbie area of the
Commonlands, I ran into plenty of soloable mobs that would fall to the above
simple methods.

I suspect it would be even easier if I actually understood the Heroic
Opportunity stuff. :-)
