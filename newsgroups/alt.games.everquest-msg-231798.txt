"What do you mean I have to delete my warrior to make a wizard?"

Sorry, I might almost have bought that argument if I hadn't seen all the
bitching about FFXI recently.  :)  Granted, your scheme could be done as a
MD5 against *all* characters, but then...

It's gonna suck when some guy installs Diablo on his work computer to play
on lunch break and gets banned for hacking because the MD5 doesn't jibe when
he logs in, or somebody runs scandisk with the wrong option checked, etc.. 
Sure, there's ways around that, and the myriad other possible problems
inherent in such a system, and each and every one of them involve expending
more resources on top of the extra resources you already spent as a result
of that design decision figuring out and implementing the solutions.
