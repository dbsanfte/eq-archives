Well, first, there was no problem with communication, /say worked just
fine.  Second, we were cleaning out mobs fairly fast as it was.
Third, there was no grouping bonus at the time, as I recall.

No, you won't.  Because if you cut the XP gained then you've cut what
we were getting.  Reducing what we'd get doesn't equal what we got.

How, efficiently?  You can't make a group of 8 to 10 (or more) people.
We were there together, helping each other out.  Just because the game
has a construct called "group" doesn't mean you absolutely must use
that construct in order to band together.
