Don't quite understand why some people change to group.  /g works just
as well for me.  I could see maybe if spamming a language, but it sounds
as though at least on FV that this is now pointless.  /g makes it easier
for me to switch methods of speaking easier, especially after leaving a
group, or in another zone because you died and have to run back etc. 
This is the method most people i have run across seem to use as well.
