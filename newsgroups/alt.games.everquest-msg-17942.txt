Very informative for future use, if I can remember it! :-), but at level
5 slowly coming up to 6 I am at the minute trying to work up 1hb, 2hb
and 1hs because I saw that recommended in some strategy guide.
Would I be better to concentrate on one and if so which one!?
At present I am using a scimitar plus shield.

Never had an offer to group except from lvl 1 newbies and one very polite
Dwarf warrior lvl 6 looking for a healer just when I was having to camp.
Can anyone point me to a site with info on grouping for Druids especially
at low levels as I do`nt want to make a mess of it when the time comes.
For instance at that level if they already have a healer would I be
expected to melee or keep out of the way etc.  In fact what does a Druid
do in a group with with a cleric and a wizard ???
