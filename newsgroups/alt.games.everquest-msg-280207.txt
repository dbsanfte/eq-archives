Can't say I've ever had that much luck in Rathe Mountains.  A good day in
Acrylia Caverns will fetch me 10k in an hour or two of farming the
bloodpriest, plus some time in the Bazaar.

Generally I'll two-box my rogue (level 70, roughly 5k/1450 AC unbuffed, all
resists/saves above 150) and my 56 shammy.  I load up dummy buffs first
(clickies mostly, then some easily replaced ones).  My shammy gets KEI.  I
then either run or get a GG/TL to Grimling Forest.  I get the full line of
shammy buffs (no resist buffs though) and run in.  Clearing the main hall
can fetch you 1,000-2,000 PP an hour.  If you go to the blood pool (near the
clicky-statue that brings you to Inner AC), you can camp the bloodpriest.  I
usually just hang out in the room before the blood pool, and he seems to
spawn ever second or third place holder.

The bloodpriest is level 50, and drops either the Blackened Acrylia Blade
(1H Slash) or the Blackened Acrylia Greatsword (2H Slash).  Both are lore,
so you can only get one of each.  Depending on my patience for his slow
spawning, I'll usually get 2-3 swords (I'm two-boxing, remember) and gate
back (gate spell on shammy to PoK, Origin on my rogue to East Freeport).  On
the Drinal server, the 1H Slash typically sells for 3k-6k, and the 2H Slash
can fetch around 4k-6k.
