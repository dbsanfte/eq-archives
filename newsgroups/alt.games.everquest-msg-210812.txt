Hi,

I recently purchased and installed PoP. I know I'm supposed to be able to
navigate around Norrath by just clicking the books on the pedestals in each
zone and being taken to the Plane of Knowledge, but whenever I click on a
book, I'm just transported to another location in the same zone.
Am I doing something wrong?

Your help is appreciated,

Temma
