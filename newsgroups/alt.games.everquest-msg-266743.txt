IMO the game does not do a very good job of explaining this process.  Any of
you have some light to shed for me?

I did the little crafting mini mission on the first island, but that is it.
It didnt tell me much about practical crafting.

Now I am in Freeport and I want to be able to craft Apprentice level 3
spells, what do I need to do?  I am a level 3 Artisan...I guess that
happened after my quest on the frist island.  But, I havent crafted since
and even if I wanted to I dont know how I would make much headway with my
current inventory situation.  I did purchase a book, level 3 Artisan
essentials that added a ton of recipes to my book.  And I got a quest from
the Dark Bargainers, collect some elm.

So I guess the first thing I need are some bags!  Where to get good cheap
ones?

Assuming I have the bag slots (nightmare flashbacks of that sadist prick aid
grimmel...urge to kill...) for it, now what?  Skill up on something first?
I dont believe I have a recipe to make a spell yet, but I could be mistaken.

What about the crafting process itself?  I have read bits and pieces about
it and it seems like a sort of mini game.  The island mission was no
problem, just sit there until a pristine thing popped out at me.  Do I need
to setup a new hotbar with crafting 'abilities' for the real world stuff?
How intuitive is it once it gets going?

Lots of questions I know, sorry about that.

TIA
