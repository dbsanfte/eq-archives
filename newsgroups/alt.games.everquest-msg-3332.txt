First thing is that if you had a decent group to game with would you
stick witht he group or do you prefer solo? I play on the nameless
server and the first night i played EQ i thought the game was
impossibly hard ( i was used to diablo2 ) but a person heard my shouts
for help and assisted. I still group with her whenever we are on
together. Same goes for another person I ran into at the same time.
Then all of us ended up joining the Dark Truth guild and we got many
guildmembers who happily help you out or group with you if your around
the same level. I just hit 13 last night and i really wanna try other
classes but not so much that im bored with Wizard as much as I wanna
use some really sought after abilities (as if bind, portal and a
plethora of big time nuke spells werent needed). I cant speak for what
its like to be level 50-something but I can say that when i'm online
(usually from 5 to 8 a.m. central) and when my buddies arent online it
does kind of suck to have everyone turn you down for groups or scream
at you to immediatly leave their sanctified camping spot. Soloing is
hard for a wiz of my level so i'm glad to have a good number of
friends already.
