I've been holding out a steadily decreasing hope, also, that it was just
a very elaborate prank being pulled by a large number of folks on our
server boards. However, some of the ones reporting first hand witness
accounts are, from years of experience with them, extremely reliable
sources and not prone to such things IMO.  Then, just an hour ago, my
assistant raid leader posted to our boards that he had just logged out
after speaking with an enchanter from our Alliance partner guild. She
claimed to have been there for three of the forced spawns. Neither our
guild, nor or Ally, have a cleric currently waiting on Rage, and neither
of us were camping rage with anyone at the time.

It would still be really great if it turned out to be a hoax, but I'm
losing hope of that.

Here's the thread on the Xev server boards that I started, begging to
find out if this was just a sad joke. Lot's of first hand responses
there:

One of the clerics from The Grey Council (Tire II Guild on Xev)
apparently sent in a request to have his ragefire spawned. (Rumor has it
he asked for a side of fried with it, which may have lowered his chances
of success.) Here's a screenshot of the appy Guide response he got a
short while later:

Welcome to the bright new world. And in the last days, it ended, not
with a bang, but with an "Ilikepotatoes" and free Water Sprinklers for
all my friends.
