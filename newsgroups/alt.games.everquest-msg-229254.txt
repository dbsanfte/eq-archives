Well I bought the gear long before I could sell it, so I was pretty 
aware of the going rate.  5pp for the muzzle, 10pp for the other parts. 
  Of course there's a reason nobody is selling lower than me, its 
because I'm deliberately selling cheaper.  Why?  Because with the bazaar 
search function, and the fact that the gear is identicle no matter who 
summons it, there's little reason for anyone to go to a higher priced 
seller.

IF I was selling out of stock every night, I'd raise my price up to 5pp 
and take my chances.  But as long as I keep logging back in and finding 
some pieces still in stock then I know I've captured all the market I can.

Lets look at it another way.  I'm selling an average of six a night. 
Raise the price to 5pp and I get an extra 6pp.. unless I lose a sale. 
Sell only 5 due to the higher price, and I now am making only 1pp more 
than selling 6 at 4pp.  Lose a second sale and I'm losing money; 20pp 
for the night instead of 24!  Unlike normal retail, there's no "cost to 
make" involved, the only thing at stake is my mana (which regenerates 
during the night anyway) and my trader bag space... but I normally sell 
less muzzles than I make in a night even at the lowest price.

At 15pp a mask, I would make more money on just two sales than I do in a 
night on 4pp each... but since there are almost always other vendors 
selling muzzles at 5pp, both when I go offline for the night and when I 
come back in the morning, I think its highly likely I wouldn't sell two; 
at 1 sale I'd be losing money, 15pp instead of 24pp, and of course at 
zero sales I'd be losing all 24pp.

Once I get weapons and belt, I again might raise my price on the muzzle 
to 5pp, knowing that I'd be competition even if people undercut me to 
4pp on the muzzle, because folks would rather buy everything from one 
source than go running all over the bazaar just to save a few pp.

Splendid One
