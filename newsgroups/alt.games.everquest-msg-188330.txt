Hmm, well thats higher spec than I had when I got SoL on the machine. He
could happily have gone to the Moon. OK since then I have added a Geforce2
and 256 extra RAM but the processor is the same and I have all the
expansions now having bought PoP about 2 weeks ago.

Erm, getting Old World alone these days is much much more hassle than
having all the expansions. Heck the latest pack I saw with All bar PoP and
LoY on it cost less than my first boxed set of Kunark+Old World (which
cost me 35 quid). There is a PoP plus Old World for less than 20 quid
which lets you go up to 65, with the planes and Old World you can happily
play all across the levels. OK there is the odd magazine fires out Old
World to drag you in but thats all its there for.

And its a bit depressing that sub 50 is 'the low level game', I dont think
thats a fair reflection on the range of play in that spread - fine if
somone has has done so much that it no longer interested then and 60+ play
is where its at for them so be it thats where they need to go for their
interest, but that skews the perception of the game as a whole - and if
someone is following that attitude without having done it all already then
they are missing out.
