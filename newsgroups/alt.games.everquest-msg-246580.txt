And in case anybody is still not crystal clear despite Tracey's correct 
information, to summarize:

all tradeskills - wis OR int
fletching - wis OR int OR dex
smithing - wis OR int OR str

NOTE THE CAPITALIZED "OR"s

If your Wis is 275 and your strength is 190, buffing your strength to 
270 is not going to make an iota of difference. It only uses the 
**highest** of the 2 (or 3) stats.
