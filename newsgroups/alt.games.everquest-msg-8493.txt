On the contrary, the quests are worth doing even for their own sake.

This is one of those times where the journey is at least as
worthy as the destination.

I had more fun doing my Ro armor quests, despite their difficulty,
than I've had most other times in the game.

But I can assure you, it's a hell of a lot less fun to grind for
enough platinum to buy quest armor than it is to actually quest for it.

Not to mention the sense of accomplishment -- you'll feel far more
like a true Warrior/Paladin/whatever if you take the "time and effort"
to travel, search, fight, and die in order to acquire your quest
armor than you ever will if instead all you can say is, "I sat in one
spot and killed the same things over and over again to gather enough
coin and sellable loot to be able to pick up my quest armor while
standing around in the East Commons tunnel".

Do you want to be an adventurer, or a merchant?

Would you rather be Sir Gallant the dragon-slayer, or Sir Gallant
the guy who killed a bunch of easy mobs for their coins enough
times that he could buy something from someone who actually
killed the dragon?

Sometimes I think that some folks are missing the point of
this game.

It's not about xp or loot.  It's about the journey.

In my opinion, you're doing the lower level guild mate a big
disservice by handing him something and depriving him of the
fun, and sense of accomplishment, that he would have gotten
from questing for the armor himself.
