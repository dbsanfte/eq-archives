Results from my own death today:

I died once, then died again just as I reached my corpse on the way back.
Went back again, looted the first corpse (not bothering with a rez at
level 20), ignored the second (empty) corpse and left it nearby. Conned
it after a while, timer was stuck at 3 hours exact, with the same
character logged in and watching it.

In other words: Hooray for three-year-old spaghetti code.
