Well, I for one didn't like all the different names for my High Elf Mage. I
tried about 20 ones I liked myself and even a few variants thereof.
Eventually I ran out of names and just tried a few from nearby books. To my
amazement Rhand got approved. As some (most?) of you might know Rand,
without the "h", is the main character in the popular Wheel of Time series.

At that time I didn't think twice about it because I was just testing
different characters. This mage though really pulled my attention and I kept
playing with it. He's now lvl 36 and I kind of regret that my name is likely
to be altered when I a GM notices it.
Maybe it's a good idea for GM's to run through lists of names when players
hit a certain level. Like 20 or so.
If my name will be changed it will probably ruin my good reputation. Nobody
will recognize me and my friends list is way to short to keep track of the
many people I grouped with.

At least my char can summon magic swords, shoot enemies with fire bolts and
let it rain devastation on groups (read the books and you know why :) Now I
only need a one-shot kill spell for Balefire... hmm does a mage get
Disintegration?
