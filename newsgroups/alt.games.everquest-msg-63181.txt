Hi,

Apparently, I seem to be missing some files associated with the new
EQ patcher.  That seems to be why I can not patch the game.

I found a file in my EQ directory called Everquest.log that makes
reference to a default skin file for the patch program, which does
not exist in my EQ directory.  (And I have no sub directories in
the folder either)

I guess somehow I did not get some of the files when the game patched
itself.

I have no Skins folder within my EQ directory.  And from what I just
read on the message board I also seem to be missing a new DLL file
(called win32bitmap.dll) as well.

I have Direct X8.0 installed (and have been running it for weeks).
I tried logging into the test server (as people have suggested) to
try to get the missing files but it has not worked.

I have no Skins folder and no default skin file, so the patcher apparently
just terminates itself.

I am not sure why I did not get the files.  Or how to get them now.

Can someone who can log in confirm that they do have a skins folder
now, and the DLL file that I mentioned?

Perhaps someone could email me a zip of their skins directory and the
win32bitmap.dll file, so I could try and get the patcher running.

I think someone on the message board said this worked for them.

Does the DLL file go into the main EQ folder?  I am puzzled.  I wonder
why some people did not get the files after the patch?

Has Verant said anything about this?

The new patcher looks good, maybe I will see it someday.

I know that there are other people who have reported the same sort of
problems involving the missing skins and DLL file.

Can anyone help?

Many Thanks,

 - Mike Dorr
