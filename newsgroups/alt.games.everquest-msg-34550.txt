Which mobs are we talking about, Dan? I mean, granted, maybe some high
level mobs may be randomized that I don't fight yet.  But yesterday,
while my Cleric partner was working on smithing, I agreed to go take
some lower level guildies down into Najena to camp a FBR for one of our
young Necros and possibly her book for a wizard. (Didn't drop, sadly.)
We broke the room and for three hours it spawned all three spots in 18
minutes intervals like clockwork. Admittedly, this is a low level
dungeon in the old world, but she *is* the boss mob there. Not random at
all yet.
