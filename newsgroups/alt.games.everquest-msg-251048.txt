Backspace.  Oh look a map.  Lets see, I'm here, I need to go there.  Not 
one mob in this zone will even so much as look crosseyed at me.

How hard can this be?

I didn't grow up in the warrens, most of my characters leveled up before 
it was in the game, and the few I created more recently rarely found an 
indoor zone with nothing but a single mob type all that interesting, and 
since the mobs flee when wounded (unlike the undead in Kurns), are 
indoors (unlike good old Crushbone), and have a relatively low ZEM 
behind them (unlike the infamous Paladul.. and for that matter both the 
above), well, I played around a bit but never stuck with the place long 
enough to get anywhere near the exit.

I didn't do Stonebrunt either, for some reason, just never went there, 
still have never been there with a character to whom the mobs weren't 
all green or close to it.

I started running thru warrens when I started doing LOY, and I learned 
my way thru the place (which was admittedly a maze) using the LOY map, 
in fact one of the first places I did that with.

I know, you could say "I don't have maps"... but since A) I think 
warrens is one of the newbie zones everyone has but more importantly B) 
you are trying to get thru warrens to get to LOY, which is the expansion 
that gives you mapping, well, I don't think that arguement has much basis.
