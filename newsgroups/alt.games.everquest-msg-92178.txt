I didn't say they were necessary, I said they ruled AE, and that's
true. Wizards get more AE options, of better mana efficiency, than any
other class.

You only need chanters for PBAE in close quarters. If you are outside,
you can agro drag a clump of snared mobs while ae'ing them. Basically
group quad-kiting.

I have a hard time believing that a solo monk can kill mobs as fast as
a quad-kiting caster. At what level is this monk killing 8 mobs, and
are they giving experience? Post 50, it's pretty hard for any meleeist
to go solo toe-to-toe with any dark blue mob, and win, much less 8 of
these mobs in a row. I suspect your "solo" monk is operating with
quite a few buffs and an alt healer sitting close by.

I disagree. Wizards are a fine class, and can contribute to any group.
People should invite them to groups not out of pity, but respect.
