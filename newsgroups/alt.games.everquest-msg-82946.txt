Nope, each server is a seperate "world" no swapping items between worlds. As
for differences, other than a server being a PvP server or non PvP, there
really isn't much difference.  Certain servers, tho, have reputations.  For
example, Xegony, my server, was once thought of as the gutter trash of all
servers... hehe, but that's just because all the other servers were jealous
of us (j/k)  Also, I've noticed some of the lingo on each server is
different, and people call certain spots by different names.  For example,
in one dungeon called Sebilis there are a bunch of different "camp" sites.
One camp site we call on Xegony "Grup" because the named spawn is called
Grupenthorp (or something like that) but on other servers it's called
"Disco" because the spawn is on a stage with what look like disco lights.
But other than a few changed wordings, most servers are the same.
