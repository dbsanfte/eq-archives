Try just switching off the human models - got kicked to
Desktop when zoning into Velks Lab these days, retried once
or twice then got pissed and logged on an alt, to petition.
GM told me to turn off the human Luclin models, as it
was a known problem. Maybe on some computers this
isnt only restricted to Velks Lab. I mean - what fun is Luclin
without the new models? As a matter of fact, the new
character models are the ONLY reason i bought Luclin at all.
