Alchemists can still get by just fine making what they made all along 
with zero dependancy on others.  Heck, they'll still be able to sell the 
subcombines, they will just have to price them somewhere between the cost 
for them to make them, and the cost for a nonalchemist to make them, 
instead of pricing them ludicrously high.  Mind you, with the new fuel 
costs, that will still likely be ludicrously high.  My level 12 
brawler/21 provisioner is going to have a really rough time working 
through tier 3 now, and tier 4 will be a nightmare when I get there I 
expect.
