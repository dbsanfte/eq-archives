really? say you a trucker working for a living. You can get .50 a mile, $20
an hour , or $1000 when you deliver the load that took 4 days. Oddly enough
all of the above are options and none are much diffrent from the others.

Of course the guy who drives the budget rental car back to where it was
rented makes .10 a mile , $4 an hour , or gets a nice $200 for the trip.

These are the situations you are comparing. And comparing the $200 for the
trip to the $20 and hour may seem like a good idea if you are trying to
convince the plebian that he is doing well. Occasionally however you find
someone who says hey wait a minute we both worked 4 days and he made 5 times
as much :(
