thats not my experiance kkk, 
as i noted, very few are open to the idea of paying for something, and
certainly not going to give extra' loot to compensate-those that dont
know or forgot are pretty easy to spot and they get whatever symbol i
have-the really self-involved ones are fairly easy to spot too (eg.
they drop on every other mob, when there are 6 in group and think
they're being fair) -for whatever its worth, I believe i do a good job
for my groups and am often recruited by folks I only played once with,
but they make it clear they're glad to see me eg;, just last night at
KC, I stayed an extra 2 hrs after train wreck screwed our group, to
aid in the very difficult recovery and rez of a teammate( btw,never
had played with him before)-
-back to the main point-I do often just say I dont have the
ingrediant, but if they do i'd be glad to cast---just to avoid the
aggro and beef that comes the other way-I dont play to get into
arguements with idiots-but if I only played with "nice and mature"
folks-I'd rarely get a group too-so I find I have to try to balance it
all out-
But, your reminder that many are'nt aware of need for expensive
componants is well taken and the cleric should work the point into the
conversation!! please realize kkk, that what u said made sence and was
fair.. my point is that theres lots that pretty much act the opposite
:(
