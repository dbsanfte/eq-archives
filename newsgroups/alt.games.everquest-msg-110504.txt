Thanks for your help.  I'm going to redo my SK character with 75 AGI since
he's only level 3 right now.

Rom

p.s.  Arrgh.  I just realized I created my ERU WIZ based on
eq.castersrealm.com suggestion to add 5 to STR and the rest to INT.  Because
of that, his AGI is 70.  I had a crazy INT at the beginning (142) but now
I'll be suffering at level 60.  Since he's already 35th level, restarting is
not an option.  Oh well, I'm sure I can find some AGI items to equip to
raise it to 75.
