What I found the *most* annoying was, after figuring
out how to see what the NPC was telling *me* instead
of what he was telling the other 15 people around
me (which was open the window bigger so that his
response wasn't immediately scrolled away), the
next two hours first trying to help people get through
it all (when it would have taken about 15 minutes
for them to get through if they had just *read* the
nice pretty yellow messages) and then, finally, <hangs
head in shame> ignoring the requests for 'What do I
say next????'

Oh, yeah, and the next five hours or so sitting there
off and on waiting for a group to get together who
would actually *take* me even though I'm not an ex-
tremely wanted class. Funny, but I just wanted to
*get in* a dungeon. As I sat and watched groups ooc'ing
for an hour or two, it would have made sense for them
to take me just to get into one. <shrug>
