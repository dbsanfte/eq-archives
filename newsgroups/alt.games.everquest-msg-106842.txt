Farmed both for faction, not once have I ever caused a train at that level,
there are things in CB that WILL aggro on a 50 but you can drop them where
they stand.

I would attribute that to laziness and lack of consideration, oh this zone
has lots of trains from newbies learning the ropes, another one containing
the higher level mobs won't really hurt. Tired of a pounding? OK so we don't
know what class this is, maybe it was an Enchanter...even then wonder how
long it would take the "big boys" in Blackburrow to wear down Rune IV.

Maybe so, or maybe he was just pissed that this person can ride into a
newbie area and with their title and horse (Which likely sets the person
closer to the 55 mark than 50) and not clear up the mess they have made.
I certainly can't see any excuse in not stopping the train in it's tracks,
so to speak. It's not like it was Runnyeye or Splitpaw where, even 50+, you
are in danger of being run over by mobs that will wear you down and kill
you.
