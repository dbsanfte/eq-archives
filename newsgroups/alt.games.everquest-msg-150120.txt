You dont read very well, do you?

Go take a look at my velk example.   My monk can pull 4 spiders, kill them
all with 1-2 cheals during the fight, by the end of the fight (or at least
by the time I have more spiders inc) my cleric is back to FM.  This is with
BaoR, before he had any FT, and without kei - your bog standard cleric.

Even if i MoR all the spiders, by the end of battle im still back at FM (and
I do MoR often)

I dont exp in velks anymore, but I did try it since the cleric changes,
after MoR and cheals, I left the cleric standing to melee (casting YV as
often as i could remember/be bothered to) and I still didnt drop below 95
mana over the course of an hour or two.
