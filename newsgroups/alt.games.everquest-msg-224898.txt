If it's a Velium weapon, then it won't proc until you are higher level, at 
which point the addition few points of damage will be fairly useless.  If 
It's a Coldain Velium weapon, then it will work from level 1, at which 
point the additional damage is quite significant.  Procs are random, happen 
more often the higher your Dex is.  If you are too low level, you should 
see a message along the lines of "your will is insufficient to command this 
weapon" or some such thing.  That tells you that it wanted to proc, but did 
not due to your low level.
