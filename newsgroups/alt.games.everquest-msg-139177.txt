Well that was the last straw. I saw a twink with better gear then me.
Granted im used to seeing this, but this a level 15 twink!!! He inspected me
and started laughing the sad part is he's right some of my gear is very
embarrassing for my level of 43. When I first created my cleric, I had no
clue what i was doing or what the stats were for. Thats why i got a cleric
whose very intelligent and dextorous. I keep on running out of mana (wis
problem). And this low wisdom dosent really help my tradeskill efforts. I
need to C3 or Insight to break 200 wis. Why do you ask why my equipment isnt
up to par, I have 7 out 8 tradeskills over 100, and 5 outta 8 tradeskills
over 150. My orginal plan was to smith really good armor, but i need about
25 more skill points before i can make with out failing so much. And that
will cost lots of pp. It takes a long time for me to level so planer or
thurg armor quests are not the answer.

Anyway, im selling a ton of junk so i can get money to go shopping. I need
ideas on what to get

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=335087

For my primary slot i rotate between my centi warhammer and a spirit tome
For the secondary slot i rotate between a testament of vaneer and a charred
Gaurdian sheild

Questions to think about for imput.

1. Is it worth doing the paw of oopala quest to replace the spirit tome? Is
the extra 3 wis and other stats worth it?
2. Any ideas on the arms or legs?
3. BP, I was told that a froglok scaled tunic or sebilite scal coat would be
good to get. The quest in twilight sea seems like a decent bp. I had the
cheastplate of the constant but the lack of wis was a big drawback.  Any
ideas?
4. Just need 1 more egg and i'll be able to finish up the stuff for the 3
and 4 shawls. That will replace my range slot item. is there a better range
slot item or shoulder item out there?
5. Jewelry upgrades is it worth it to get my platinum stuff upgraded to
velium so i can have the extra +3 wis and +1 str it would provide?
6. I got a book of the obolus should i swap this into my sendary slot and
lose the sheild and testament?  Its a loss of a few wis and some AC but i
gain some improved healing 2 and that would be good for healing.
7. Earring of the solstice:  this would be really nice and i can probably
make some of the stuff.  I was told that the FT 1 wont work if your 51  is
this true?

Thanks for your imput
