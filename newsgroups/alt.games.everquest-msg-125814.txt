If you have to wear one then I'd go for the Rygorr for the AC but personally
I'd see if you couldn't sell that and buy a Chest plate of the Constant
(AC20 +8 sta +5MR with Ext Enhancement II now) or if not get some friends
together and do the quest yourself.
Perhaps post a magelo profile or a list of your weaker locations for some
hints (I did this for my druid and found it a lot of help)
