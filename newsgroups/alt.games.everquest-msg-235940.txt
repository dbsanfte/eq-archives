Hail,

I'm getting back into EQ after a long absence. I think I used to know
these answers, but I can't seem to remember them.

How does mana recovery work?

Is it a percent of maximum, or a number per tick, and if so what is it
based on?

Does this apply to normal mana recovery, sitting mana recovery,
meditation, Flowing Thought/Clarity?

Does Flowing Thought stack with Clarity and the like?

How does Flowing Thought stack up against Clarity?

And while were on the subject does health recovery work in the same
way?

The reason I'm asking is because I'm looking to twink my character a
bit, for soloing.
