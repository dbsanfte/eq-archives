If you think about it, having a magical burst of fire hit me in the
face, getting hit with a poison bolt, or having a skeleton walk around
and try and kill me would not make me readdy feel like fighting. The
burst of fire is bound to burn off the armor, no matter how many
poison bolts I get hit with I never seem to double over in sickness,
and with as many times as I have died, I have never seen my OWN
skeleton.

But, this is fantasy. I still wanna know with all the orcs around, why
I never see a female orc, or a baby orc. They have to come from
somewhere. So, where do baby orcs come from?

Even without seeing the sky I can tell north. If I heat a bar of iron,
and whack it hard, or quench it, it becomes slightly magnetic. I can
use a piece of iron from somewhere, and a coconut shell to float it
on.

Of course if you put me on a desert island, I will spend all my time
chasing Maryann and Ginger around, and wont have to worry about
getting captured.
