Your best bet (least work, highest probability of success) is to set your
system up as dual boot... WinXP/2000/98 and Linux.

When you want to run EQ or other games, boot your system as Windows and
run.  Otherwise, boot as Linux.  Once nice thing is that Linux will be
able to read the Windows partitions.  Windows might be able to read
Linux partitions too, but I'm sure that requires some freebie software
from somewhere... of course Microsoft wouldn't support that!
