You might have noticed SOE have made more changes to make the game more
soloable. I have previously said they should downgrade some heroic mobs
to solo to reflect how the game is played. It just seems they've gone
and changed the wrong ones. In Antonica scarecrows and stag are now
individual. Why? These where some of the more popular groups mobs and
the few people got together to kill. Last night no one was getting
them. They need to downgrade some Gnoll mobs imho. After the ones by
Qeynos there aren't many that are soloable.

It will be interesting to see if anyone bothers with the coven now they
are soloable. They were totally ignored before.

Anybody spotted any other mobs that have changed?
