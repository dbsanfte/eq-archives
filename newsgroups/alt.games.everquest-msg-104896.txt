This might tie up with the disappointing perfomance everybody is see, and
the thread posted here a few days ago.


Planet everquest say

Absor addresses these two issues, in response to player questions about the
recent changes to the game:

Umbra is in and working. It was never supposed to be anything that made a
visible change, it just makes it so that the millions of polys in the game
get rendered less frequently.


However i have done some tests and found that UMBRA is still not working
correctly.  If anybody else wants to test this, then they can try the
following.
Adding the lines
UseTnL=False
UseUmbra=False
to there eqclient.ini
or follow the instructions at www.nillbase.com/eq.htm

once this has happened you should see noticeable changes in cities,
especially if you have an older machine even in the old world, my friend
dosent have luclin installed but after december the 4th when luclin arrived,
his framerates in cities was unplayable and he kept walking into walls
(450mhz, 256MB, tnt m64 card), after making the changes above his system was
back to how it was before luclin.  This proves that umbra is still screwing
things up, even in the old world (any world not including luclin), i
notified planteverquest and other pages about this time and time again, but
nobody bothered about it there.

My system has the following specs
1.4Ghz AMD
512MB Ram
Geforce 2 64Meg

Of course if this dosent help, then simply remove the lines to turn back to
normal.

Please pass on your information.
