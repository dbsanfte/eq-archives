    Magelo is your friend. ;-)

> Amulet of the Grey Wastes

    This is weak, but this might be your "I'm too lazy to swap in an EB
item" item. I know how that is. ;-) If you aren't too lazy to swap in
something, a WW dragon talisman would fit nicely here insofar as No Drop
items go. Or a Seb Scale Collar for something cheap with small resists, fair
AC and good MANA.

> 2 velium jasper rings

    Give up some WIS here for a Shadel Bandit Ring. AC, HPs and resists are
good, and the total MANA loss isn't too steep (the Collar above should cover
for it). You could join the AoE group and camp one, XP in the zone and pick
up a rot, or bite the bullet and buy one for about 1 K. The good news is
your current ring, when you sell it, will offset the cost by a fair bit.
Check what a vendor will pay you before setting your bazaar price, but it
should go for at least 250 pp.

> Silvery Belt of Contention

    This is the Kael haste belt, isn't it? Truth is, it's wasted on your
waist (even with your love of melee). And the amount of cash you'd get
selling it off is significant. Alternatives here include the Oakleaf Girdle
from PoG (sells in the 1-2 K range), and the Chitinous Belt from FG ( AC 13
STR/STA/WIS 5 DR 10, 1 K range, if you can camp the Shik'Nar Royal Guards
you WILL get one). If you know who the local uberguild is, they will get a
metric ton of the FG belts when they camp their FG shard - inquire with them
about purchasing one for 1 K, I bet they leap at it.

> Donals Boots of Mourning

    Dusty Soriz Boots are AC 12 HP 40 and 25 points of resists, should be 1
K or so. People camping ore for Shissarbane weapons get a ton of them, and
usually don't have enough twinks to pile them all on. ;-) If you're already
in contact with a guild about the Chitinous Belt, ask them about the boots
at the same time.

> Seal of Thurgadin

    I've seen the Ceremonial Smudging Stick down to 2 K these days. No
MANA/HP increase, but the resists beat the Seal. AC 3 WIS 3 MANA 30 FR/PR/MR
10. The only pain-in-the-ass factor with the Stick is it's a torchlight
light source, so if you have no other light sources you'll see that annoying
"flickering" lighting effect when you're in dark places.

    FT you won't get for under 10K (your target budget). Not much useful
clicky stuff out there for cheap - I saw a Prelate's Rubicite Helm
(right-click Root, from CT) for sale for 6 K recently but I strongly suspect
that was an exception. Do you have a Faithstone yet?

    You could also get Underfoot Plate Bracers for 10 K or so: AC 26 WIS 5
HP/MANA 30 and 5 all saves. They're the most popular of the Underfoot Plate
pieces, and the most useful - it'll be a looooong time before you upgrade
them.
