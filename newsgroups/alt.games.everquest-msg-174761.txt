Maybe.. depends what approach you take I guess.

We already had a shitload of BoCs from AoW farming, before we killed
XTC/HP..

And has anybody actually been tested by XTC?  Im sure we've wiped on him..
we are so skilled in doing retarded things and wiping to the most trivial
mobs (e.g something agroing the whole room on us).. but in terms of
toughness, he pribably has the best risk v reward loot in the game

Heh.. as a result of all that insane Dain farmings, you should see some of
the stuff that rots (goes FFA) or is given to first-ever raiding recruits..
pretty much any belt in SoL (including vexthal) we've been lucky to get even
1 tell for.

Maybe when I get my 4th PC online and figure a way to bot 6+ chars
effectively (read: never) I'll try him again.. he's not somebody I can kill
with my current bot-army, and I hate to drag ppl to help on a mob, where the
rest of his loot would just rot

Since our first killing of cursed/emp we've killed every single pop since (I
really do mean EVERY one).  Something like 32 of the last 35 AoW kills were
us too (wanna buy a BoC, 300k?)  That sob bought the whole guild a horsey
for christmas (cept me, /thank vacation timing..)

Anyway we were never strong on Paladins, 2 have a copy, and Id say we have
2-3 "solid raiders".. similar for druids and shamans actually (3-4 or so you
can count on at most raids)

Wow..  I've only had the luxury of 85 or so guildies at a raid (e.g ntov)
and it became horrid to play.. been in ntov with 210 people in the place,
that was pretty bad.

One day we got to nToV first (early ntov days, aary could take a while) an
hour or so later guild_2 started forming, and then decided CoHing to aary
pit would be a good way to leap over us (we were IN aarys pit at this
time).. 200 people stood in 1 small pit, I bet even Furors PC would have
choked...

Lag was so bad, the frst pull (2 flurrys) wiped EVERYBODY.. it was
unbelievable, flurry spam of 200 people dieing just flooded the screen (chat
buffer didn't even hold the whole of the "fight")

Half way through the CR they pulled Flurrys (blaming us for the first pull,
that wiped everybody).. 2 mass wipeouts later, a GM finally appeared.
