Has anybody noticed a significant impact of the one-character-only
policy on a server's economy? I would think that this would drive prices
down, because people would tend to sell off goods rather than keep them
for alts, and conversely, players would only buy for one character, and
not for any twinks. I think this would result in spectacularly low
prices after a few months.

I don't have a character in Sullon Zek to check this, but has anybody
noticed this happening, or am I just barking?
