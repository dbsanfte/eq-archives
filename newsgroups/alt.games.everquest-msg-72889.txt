As has often happened to me you are probably spelling it incorrectly.
If you type:

/camp dekstop

it gives you no error message but instead just camps you. Of course it
only camps you to the char select screen since you spelled "desktop"
wrong. Its surprising how many times I've done exactly that when just
typing along, usually I catch my mistake before I camp you must type
exactly:

/camp desktop

you may even want to make an alias/shortcut key for it.
