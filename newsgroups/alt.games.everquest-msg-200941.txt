And this answers my question how, exactly?  Fact: I never claimed to be 
using Lightning Strike at that level, I don't know *what* you were 
responding to with this tripe.  Fact: I was taking down 2 Large Zelniaks 
on a single bar of mana at level 28, even after KEI faded.  Fact: you 
have zero proof of anything I was or wasn't doing at level 28.  Fact: you 
have absolutely nothing backing you up here except your own confusion and 
the ability to snip all context away from my posts.  Next time, instead 
of re-capping the thread, try not snipping it away entirely and answering 
the actual question.

So you don't refute that it's possible to accomplish (as my calculations 
have proven), you only refute that I had actually put those calculations 
to use?

Yet we've already established that it's possible to take down multiple 
(two) reds at 28, with a realistic mana pool at that level, without KEI.  
And indeed I was!  The fact that I was taking down 3 with KEI has no 
bearing on my ability to accomplish what I initially claimed I was.

Thanks for the recap of this thread to date, now try actually replying.
