Well, a fighter can dish out decent damage through heroic
opportunities, some of which require special fighter-only abilities.
You can also do some halfway decent damage using your special attacks,
though it won't be close to what mages or scouts can do per attack.
You will run out of power if you constantly use your abilities, but
then so will everyone else (and they'll probably draw aggro and get
killed, too).  But the primary role of the fighter is keeping the
opponent focused on them, which at this point is probably a little too
easy to do just with taunt and shout.

Personally, I don't find playing a fighter boring at all.
