No kidding.  I've twice seen post-50 Clerics LFG for over 15 minutes in
Velk's.  The first time I ever popped in to have a look (I was L50)
there was a 54 Cleric LFG, dunno if he ever got a group, and again when
I was in a group killing spiders near the zone a 52 Cleric was looking
for about that long before an opening occurred in the group I was in.
A mid-40s anything is gonna have a bitch of a time getting a group in a
place like that.
