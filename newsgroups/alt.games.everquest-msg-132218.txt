Did everyone notice how much smoother everything went on Chaney's
 watch? Now thats how a country should be run!!
 
 What?? - Are you *seriously* saying that the solution to the
  Israel/Palestine situation is to make the US Vice-President
 into the US President? 
  Just rattling your cage!! LOL ,I have no sulutions to the prophecy at
  hand! I am simply amazed that the  bible's Revelations are still
  pointing fingers at Isreal ,being the main topic of concern.Seems as
  though Nastrodamous might have had visions instead of Quartrains.
  However a persons heritage should not play favoratism.I believe JESUS
  was not Mexican but was a Jew and he would have made a fine Vice
  president same as Chaney could have been the President .I did not
 vote
  for Bush but If he runs again I will. Was that politically correct?
 On second thought I do have an opinion as to what is happening.I have
 been mighty fortunate to be born an American and not had to cope with
 such dreadful things.It seems to me like I am stuck in a time warp and
 things that should have been improved have not progressed at all.Like
 the days of the gladiators fighting till their death to please the
 crowd.To me this is Barbaric had civilization not froze in time and
 education was plentiful then teaching men to be fishers to provide for
 themselves would feed them for a lifetime.But what went wrong ?The
 educated learned how to decieve the less fortunate and keep them at
 bay.Then greed set in and there was no other way but to survive except
 through evil deception.Now we've been reading this for centuries and
 have not believed in it's truth.So what to do a drastic change has got
 to be made or there will be no getting along!!Traveling down the same
 path will always lead to the same place in time! The problem is its
 not the "yellow brick road" its reality!!
