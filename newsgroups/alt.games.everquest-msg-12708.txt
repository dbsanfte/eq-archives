Thanks!  I hadn't thought about sitting up on the wall there, good idea,
although I had only been in the zone for about 10 seconds, not even long
enough to finish my first bandage before I got killed.

BTW, the reason I was so angry was that when I told the 30ish that he got me
and another guy killed afterwards he just told me, "oh, too bad" and ran
off, wasn't even sorry.
