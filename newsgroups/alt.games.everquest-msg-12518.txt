It's not a moral dilemma...at least, it shouldn't be.  You made the person
feel good by helping a newbie.  Oddly enough you did the right thing by
accepting the gift.

What you do with the gift is totally up to you.  If you want to throw it
away (dropping it on the ground or putting it on a newbie critter destined
to be slaughtered by guards could easily be throwing it away) that's totally
up to you, or if you want to give it to someone, well, that's totally up to
you.

Personally, I'd probably stick it in the bank and spend it as necessary, and
think kind thoughts of the person who helped me, any time I go to the bank.
