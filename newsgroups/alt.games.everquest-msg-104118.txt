 < I wonder if they have any control over their own catalog.>

Absolutely zero.  Look at Napster.  There are a few artists that sniveled
about the service (Fuck you Metallica, you suck) but it was the record
labels that were so fervently against it.  They are the ones who lose the
most money over the breach of rights.
When you buy a CD for $16, sadly, less than $1 goes to the artist.  Best Buy
makes less than $2 per sale (a friend of mine gets these at cost, minimal
savings at best), pressing the discs cost pennies as does distribution.  The
bulk goes to the record companies who own the rights to the artists catalog,
and ultimately, the asses of the artists themselves.
Rock stars are far from lawyers and rocket scientists.  Watch any "Behind
the Music" episodes on VH1 and you will be amazed.  It seems like 90% of
these artists at some point get screwed out of tons of money by the record
execs.
Sad, but most of them are so drugged up they don't realize it until it's
behind them.
