I don't think large rotations are the only time they become bad or wrong...
even on small rotations there are problems.
The whole point that its player ran goes a long way from proving to me its
fair and unbiased too.. and that the running guild doesn't abuse its power.

Who decides what mobs are on rotation/schedule?  On Prexus it was the #1
guild (who also ran the rotations) who decided which mobs were on the
calendar and which weren't.

1 issue here was first brood dragons - they refused to rotate these mobs
because they were actively pharming them and keying up for releasing the
sleeper.  The official quote was "if the broods were rotated it would take
months before any guild had enough keys to launch a raid".... fair enough...
but at the same time Trakanon WAS on rotation (and it was a 30odd name
list..)

Why was it acceptable  for guilds to wait 4(average number of teeth) x 30
(number of weeks between kills) x 15 to obtain enough Trak teeth to make a
VP raid, but not acceptable or a 3-4 guild brood rotation?

The simple truth is the calendar held everybody back but the guild who was
running it.. the guild who was already done with VP and now farming the crap
out of Velious was able to make a bottleneck in Kunark to hold all rival
guilds back.

There were numerous examples of guilds breaking Planes rules (going into a
plane early, or staying late, going in after another guild left, etc etc)
but the punishment seemed guild specific.... (or biased as hell!)

Mobs staying up for days on end because people were in no rush to kill it,
knowing the rotations was protecting their mob..

Guilds who were once grand, being on an exclusive rotation (such as the
4-long CT list or 3 long Dain list) but had long since self destructed and
couldn't kill the mobs alone... they still got the cherry pick of the loot,
cuz hey.. the rotation said "this pop belongs to xxxx"  but they could use
whoever they wanted to help them kill (were talking mass pick-up in some
examples).. and of course people would jump at the chance to join them, they
werent seeing the mobs any other way.

Guild 1 learning an encounter.. no pressure or restrictions on their
attempts.. and then when they put it on rotation, forcing every other guild
into a tough trial giving them little room for learning (you got 1 night to
attempt the mob, and if you failed you lost out for 2 whole turns of the
rotation, re-joining on the 3rd turn from now)...

Rotations suck!
