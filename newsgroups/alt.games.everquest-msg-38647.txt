Hi,

I just wanted to share three things from yesterday.

I was playing my barb shaman.  A friend was trying to get the Miller's bear
fur armor so we were out in West Karana killing bears.  I was off by myself,
running around and saw a brown bear.  Dumdedum, I start whacking on it. Hear
a swooshing noise.  Oh look at the nifty treant.  Look at the nifty treant
run at sow speed.  Look at the nifty treant run at me at sow speed.  Treant
hits YOU for 57 points.  Treant hits YOU for 57 points.  Fortunately I was
near the QH zone line and zoned out.   That was a pulse pounder.  I guess
treants are druids, or at least druidlike in that they don't like people to
kill bears.

My wife and I were playing our Druid/Enchanter combo in LOIO.  The only
chatter in shout and ooc was beggars looking for buffs, and anything that
could be spared for a new monk, and people either declaring something was
camped, people warning other people to stay away from what they had already
declared as camped and people who wanted to know what was camped.  My wife
made a funny comment, "Verant made begging a skill, why don't they make
camping a skill?"  hehe

YOU have spent another hour staring at the screen with only occasionally
moving. Your skill at camping increases (27).

Then we got to thinking about it.  Training could be a skill, too.

A greater scalebone skeleton is added to your train.  Your skill at training
increases (105).
The greater scalebone skeleton leaves your train and whacks a newbie.  Your
skill at training increases (106).

Training is a fine art and a two step process.

The last thing is that my druid was getting bored in loio and decided to go
see fob.  I sow'ed and camo'ed and ran through west and east cabilis.  Now
that's excitement.  I was literally shaking when I got to the otherside.  On
my first run to the city entrance I lost camo about 50 feet from the guards.
I u-turned and recamo'ed.  The second time I made it all the way through
west cabilis and lost camo in east cabilis around the merchant area.  I
recamo'ed and ran out to the field of bone.  I didn't actually RUN through
cabilis, I swam most of it.  I didn't have any fishscales so I had to keep
coming up for breath.  I rebinded (rebound?) myself and camped.  If I still
smoked I would have had a cigarette.  That was intense.

I return you now to your previously scheduled programming.

Lewis
