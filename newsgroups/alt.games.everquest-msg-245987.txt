Agreed C3PO is nearly as bad in the newer movies, but used to be a
likeable character IMO in Eps 4-6. Jar Jar has been annoying from the
get go. With 3PO, he had some sort of dignity in Eps 4-6 in contrast
to his sometimes annoying banter.

With Jar Jar, its his annoying way of doing everything. The way he
talks. His unfunny bumbling ways. And one thing that really annoys me
is the ol 'accidental' hero bit (same can be said of the space battle
in Ep1 with Anakin but I suppose one could put up some sort of "force"
argument on that - but still didnt care for it).

Why both Jar Jar and 3PO had to be dumbed down for 10 year olds is
beyond me.
