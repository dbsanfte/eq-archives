If they say they don't want to answer you anymore, they're not going to
answer you anymore.   You can try writing to other people at Verant if you'd
like, but who knows if that will help.  It certainly can't hurt at this
point.

I can't find the producer's email address but someone might post it (Brad
McQuaid).  When you write to him, make sure that you make your letter easy
to read (easier than your post, because it was difficult).

- Break your paragraphs down and put a carriage return between them (like I
did).
- Get to the point in the first paragraph, and make sure it's short.  DON'T
make him read a full page just to figure out what the hell you want from
him...I know of no one with that much patience. :)  The first paragraph has
your point.  All other paragraphs expand on it.
- Remember to spell check
- Don't insult anyone and don't curse.
- Be nice, and be polite.
