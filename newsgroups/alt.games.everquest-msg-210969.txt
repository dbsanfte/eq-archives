You are another person who seems to equate being poor and suffering,
on purpose, with roleplaying. I really don't understand where people
get this idea from. That would be like saying that men at arms, or
mercenaries, in real life were purposefully poor even if opportunities
presented themselves. I think that could not be farther from the
truth.

Roleplaying, by definition, means playing according to the way that
world works. Adventuring is the high life. It isn't "wanting to play
that way" or "fun", it is just the way it is. 

I'd think if you were going to roleplay that way, you'd have to be
roleplaying someone dim who did not make money when they could,
choosing instead to talk to bunnies or something. It wouldn't really
make much sense.
