The account can be banned if they have proof, they just need to
*know*, believe it or not Verant doesn't spend all day patrolling
playerauctions hoping to stumble across an identifiable account.

You can petition it, they note it, look into it. They may not ban on
that alone, but any account under suspicion of being ebayed or
transferred in that way is generally refused all reimbursal requests
no matter how reasonable. And if they do find proof, kaput account.
