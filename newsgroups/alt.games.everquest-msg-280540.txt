/pet focus is only obtained through AA.

Without any AA, your only hope is to tell the pet to back off, and then
tell it to attack the new target, and hope nothing else hits it in between
those two commands.

Even then, pets will switch targets based on various rules and reasons.

/pet focus forces the pet to stay on one target, but as I said, it's
obtained via AA.
