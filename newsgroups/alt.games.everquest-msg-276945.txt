Could be, but frankly sounds pretty stupid.  Personally, I would not be 
taking the time to question someone about their motives for breaking into 
my house.  Having to wait for them to leave the kitchen before you can 
deal with it is probably the most assinine thing I can think of.  Of 
course, we are talking about California here...

What if your only way to get out of your house from your bedroom takes 
you through or past the kitchen?

I can just see it now.  Excuse me Mr. burglar, are you here just to steal 
food?  Oh, go right ahead then.
