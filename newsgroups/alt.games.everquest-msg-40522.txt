Well, I currently have a 1.4 athlon, 512MB ram (might become 1.5GB because
it's just so damn cheap!) and a GeForce2 32 mb. I was just wondering why
this isn't enough for a serious clipping plane as the interview said:
"... that with the new clipping plane out to maximum, there was [is] no
computer on the market that would be able to run many of the zones in
Shadows of Luclin."

i.e.. What could I possibly upgrade (in the far distant future) to get max
clipping?
