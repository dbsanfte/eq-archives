Yes, but I've turned down a rez because I'd caught a buff.
Let's see, 29 wizard, dead in Dawnshroud:  Would I rather have a
nice 96% epic rez from cleric who trained the zone where I was or
retain the MGB KEI someone just cast in Nexus while I was running
back?  Oh, and let's not forget the MGB Aego that went off right
after that...

That was a simple choice:  "Nah, no rez needed, thanks though."
