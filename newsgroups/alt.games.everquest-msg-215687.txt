I mostly have seen the "two rotation" system, and I prefer it. Augments
are pretty common, and nice items are not. And most adventures get a
couple augments in them. If you do multiple adventures with one group
(As I usually do), most people will get them. Then, also, there are some
augments that noone REALLY wants, but take anyway. They'd rot if it came
to that. 

However, I also specifially ASK which system is used at the start, and I
abide by that. I don't argue, whine, or cajole the leader into changing.
I think you did the right thing; just because they didn't agree with the
policy doesn't mean it changes. You were group leader, you explained it
at the start, so yes, that item is rightfully yours.
