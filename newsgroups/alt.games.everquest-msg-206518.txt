I was going to do that, but I figured that anything is possible and opted
for the full reinstall, because you never know.  This way, if it happens
again, I can eliminate anything to do with existing EQ files.  I only have
one "page" of hotkeys, and I only messed with a few colors.  Being a
warrior has its advantages that way, a lot less to set up the way I need
it :)  And I use the default UI so there is nothing to really change
there, just moving around of windows.

Thank you though.

Also do you know if EQ makes and registry entries.  I do not believe
they do, but I just wanted to make sure.
