Practically every top guild does eventually.
Here's the reason why:

Dragon faction:  Three main encounters in Kael (well, ok, so you have
AoW as well) and realistically only one named dragon in HoT with
stupidly rare drops for quests.

Giant faction:  13 named in ToVN, 3 named in ToV West, First Broods
and god knows how many freaking dragons in WW.

You want to kill a lot of stuff?  Go with Giant faction.

Of course, you can pop dorfs regardless of which faction you go
(unless you go Coldain).
