My advice is to learn to live with it. Have what fun you can now,
because by lvl 24(ish) you start to play a much bigger healing roll.
And by 34 you are reduced to purely healing/buffing/stunning.

Forget the melee as soon as you can, or you will quickly cop a no
group label from fellow players.

Wanna bash something? Create a warrior monk or rogue.
