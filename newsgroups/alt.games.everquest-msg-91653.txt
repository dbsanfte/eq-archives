Can they rez themselves? Is it a service people want badly enough to
pay for? 'Nuff said.

All this crap about how rezzes and sows and breezes and heals should
be free is just that - CRAP. When you choose a char, you do so going
in with the understanding that you can/cannot do certain things, you
can/cannot make money doing certain things and lastly, you will/will
not have to PAY for certain items/services.

You want free SoW? Be a druid. You want free breeze? Be a chanter.
Don't know if you can even rez yourself or not - doubt it - but I'm
pretty sure you would have a tough time finding a cleric who would
charge a fellow cleric for a rez. Point is, nobody owes you ANYTHING
and nobody is responsible for making the game easier for you.

/em takes a step and crashes to the ground not realizing that at some
point during this post he had stepped up onto a soapbox. Getting back
to his feet and dusting himself off, he shakes his head with a chuckle
at the futility of his own frustration and begins to don his
flame-retardant mail...
