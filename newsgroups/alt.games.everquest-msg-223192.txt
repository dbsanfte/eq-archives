Useless I'm afraid.  The software is incidental - it's the account key
that's the important part.  Without it, you can't create an account with
which to even play the game.

You'll have to get a new account key.  Fortunately, EverQuest is currently
being sold for something like $30 that will give you an account key good for
all expansions except Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  That might be something you
want to acquire.
