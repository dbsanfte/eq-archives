Nope, you're not alone. But I don't feel "hostile" about it;  whatever
negative feelings I had were handled pretty much by just walking away and
picking up CoH on a lark. The loss was more than made up by the great
adventures we're having in CoH. And I'm not alone. Richard Lawson and I just
logged after a night of some *incredible* battles. He's almost caught up to
me (26 to my 28) and both of us are itching to try out the new content in
the first feature update ("Throug the Looking Glass"), downloading in the
background as I speak.
