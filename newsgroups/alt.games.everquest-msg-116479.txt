Yes, but learning to haggle in EQ then applying that to RL can be dangerous.

You are in a market in another country and hear someone (or yourself) shout
"PC on _item_!".  Even worse when you hear a few responses "# pp!" and "# pp
per stack!".
Then you have to thank E-bayers for something.  They have taught us that
about 50pp is a rough equivalent to the american dollar, then just convert
that to what ever currency you're using.  So that means about 140pp is the
appropriate price for a gallon of milk (therefore showing that the milk in
EQ is likely 8-12 ounce bottles...and even worse, not needing refrigeration,
its probably soy (sp?) milk as well?).

I'll be OK as long as someone doesn't walk up to me and say "SoW plz" in
real life, or on a murder/death scene, walk over to the body, bend down on
one knee next to it, start looking through the person's clothes, then stand
up and shout "Phat lewt!".
