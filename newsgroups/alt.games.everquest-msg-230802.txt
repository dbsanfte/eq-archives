The greyhoppers in Marus Seru are trivial to solo with a poorly equipped 
melee.  My, at the time, 29 warrior was soloing them with no haste item, 
and no buffs, with an uber Ebon Razor main hand, and some crappy piercer 
off hand.  (Both weapons I have since replaced in the bazaar for the 
princely sum of about 500pp)  This is starting at 50% health, so work on 
that BW skill.
