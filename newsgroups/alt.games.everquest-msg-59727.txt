    Which is the case. They didn't even get all the bits and pieces of
Kunark removed in time for EQ general release - the entire Ring of Scale
faction on bards, things in MM, and (originally) on Perma goblins is only
found in Kunark. Likewise Slaythe, a triggered spawn in Misty Thickett, had
a few embryonic Kunark factions left on him. I imagine they realized they
wouldn't have the time to make Kunark a part of EQ and so just went with
what they had - didn't the original box say there was five continents, and
not the three that shipped?
