Sounds to me like you don't have LOY and he does.  Maps were recently enabled
for everyone in cities and newbie zones, but remain exclusive to LOY purchasers
for the rest of the game... except that there are a few zones where even LOY
users can't use maps; its suspected that there are quests to unlock mapping for
those zones but no one has reported actually finding one and making it work.

Another possibility is that you don't mean you can't open the map in those
zones, but rather than you don't see any map when you do open it.  This could
be because you have height filter set wrong, or your viewing area is too small,
so you aren't seeing any details at all... but more likely the problem is that
you don't have maps for those zones loaded.

EQ doesn't actually include maps for most zones, just the cities and newbie
zones I mentioned earlier.  LOY didn't give us maps, it gave us a cartography
(*map making*) system, we're supposed to make our own maps.  Which,
fortunately, some people did, so the rest of us who aren't lunatic enough to
spend all that time running around doing the tedious labor of mapping get the
benefit.

So go to EQAtlas or EQ Toolbox or somewhere like that and download the maps for
the remaining zones and then try it again, although if you dont' have LOY
registered it still won't work.
