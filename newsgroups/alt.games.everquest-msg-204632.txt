 >Wolves dont give faction hits,

They don't? Other things do. I can go into an area,
a certain mob will not be KOS to me, but I kill a few
(a lot) of them and they'll see me and attack.

Or at least that's the way it seems to me. And if
that isn't the way it is, then why are there other
rangers and druids that wolves will attack on sight?
What did they do that made them aggro?
