     Pick the server. Anyone can come in here and portray a real life =
badass and think more of himself. Bring it to a server and let me =
humiliate you till a GM bans one of us. I notice I don't see any of you =
on Drinal or Rallos talking this crap. Why? because just like Lokari, =
you fear me in game, you fear the embarrassment you will suffer.

     So, pick a server.  If ya got balls.

     Now, you have two choices.

    1) You can reply how immature this challenge is and how it wont =
prove anything, thus boosting your ego, only impressing yourself to a =
level that you can tell your wife how your so bad cause you showed =
GetsumJ.

    or

    2) Create any character (Toon), bring it to a server (PVP), and try =
and be a man. I'll train ya, bash ya, and probably make you crawl back =
to the NG telling people how stupid the challenge was so you left. =
(coughcoughpussy)

     If you show your pathetic faces, I not only will be surprised, but =
I'll leave the NG. No new names, no more bash. People probably get tired =
of it in here so take it to the game.


    PS - SK,Avenger, and any other names you accuse me of using are a =
joke and very false.

    You want me out? then show up. You don't show, then you must really =
love to read my stuff. Put up, or Shut up. Spare the NG

    GetsumJ

    =20
    Who are you and why don't you just go away?  All your proving is =
that your 13 and don't have a life.  *sigh*
