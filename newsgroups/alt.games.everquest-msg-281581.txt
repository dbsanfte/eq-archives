Hey,I found some NPCs in DSP yesterday under the surface,bug exists
since Luclin,anyone here can top this?  =)
I like the extended tracking range AAs not working(reset to 200),glad
I only bought one level of it.
Not like on my Cleric,10 AAs wasted on improved HoT AAs,they are
simply not working,AA HoT still heals for 250.
I am glad too that they once again toy around with the UI,last time
they did (sometime last year's autumn ?) I lost *all* my UI settings
including macroes on every char I dared to log in,and not once,
was fun to reposition all windows after every login for weeks.  =)

I am anxious to see what they break this time.  =)

Is it really demanded too much to fix old bugs first before adding
new features not to speak of releasing Expansions?
