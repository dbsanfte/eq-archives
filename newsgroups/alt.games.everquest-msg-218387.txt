Seems to be a pretty natural extension to the direction you were headed.  
OK, you say you are not qualified, but you at least imply that there are 
those who are qualified to make such decisions.

I do agree that parents who have genetic problems that they know they are 
likely to pass on to children should consider very seriously whether they 
want to take that chance, however, ultimately, the choice should be 
theirs to make.  I also feel that they should be capable of dealing with 
the choice they make (financially, emotionally,...), but, then, I feel 
that way about anyone having children.
