It looks like they've kind of muddied the water a bit since I purchased my 
laptop a couple of years ago. At that time, you either bought a P4 or a 
P4M. The P4 may have had a slight performance advantage, but not a lot.

Now they seem to have merged the P4M into their Centrino mobile technology 
(R). You can read more about the differences here:
