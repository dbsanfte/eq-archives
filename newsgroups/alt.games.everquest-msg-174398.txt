Hmmm. Actually, in my experience they do 'Push' extended warranties. I
bought my first palm-pilot from BB and the guy who sold me the palm
also sold me an extended warranty on the basis of 'anything' happening
to the palm I'd be covered. Well, anything did happen - the screen
broke in a 3 foot fall (palm was in a hardcase) and the same guy who
sold me the policy refused to cover the warranty. Suddenly he had me
reading the fine print.

I took my case to the manager who basically said 'Well, sorry our guy
lied to you but there's nothing I will do.' and brushed me off. This
is a Best Buy where I've literally bought thousands of dollars in
merchandise and I refused to go there until the head manager and his
lackey had left the store.

They also push cell phone warranties that are essentially
meaningless...given that many phones will break in a manner not
covered by warranty before the battery dies.

Some of the posters to www.bestbuysux.com are clearly thieves, but
many of the posts jibe with my own experiences there and the
experiences I've had working with people in general.
