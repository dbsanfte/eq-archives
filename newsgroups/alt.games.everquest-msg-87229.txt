Any of you EQ mavens out there able to help me?

Two days back my *Current Target* window disappeard from my full screen mode.
It's still there when I switch to the windowed view. Any ideas as to what may
have happened?  I ran a complete file check, total virus scan etc etc etc. Did
I hit the wrong button? If so what can I do to get it back up? Do I need to
uninstall EQ and reinstall? <groan>

It really slows me down and  penalizes my group mates because it takes far
longer to tarrget a particular MoB. don't think the EQ intent is to play in
windowed mode.  And as you may have expected, *nonTech Support* was somewhat
less than supportive.

Thanks in advance

David N
