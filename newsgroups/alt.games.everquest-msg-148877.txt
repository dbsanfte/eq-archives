Yep, I spotted yer name in that other thread a minute ago. :)

Yeah, 15", 14" viewable, whatever. :) I have a wholebasement full of 
computer bits at this point.  My strategy was just to let it be widely 
known around the university that if anyone was throwing out any sort of 
computer hardware, I'd come and haul it away for 'em.  Eventually, you end 
up with some damn reasonable monitors.  And a bunch with weird hourglass 
displays, but those will just have to become art someday.  Or furniture.  
I have a bookshelf of the old board and cinderblock variety substituting 8 
Mac Classics for the cinderblocks. :)
