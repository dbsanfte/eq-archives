Rooting or hate kiting would have been very good plans, compared to the
"warrior tanks while waiting for slow to land, and while waiting for the adds
to be mezzed" plan, which really sucks in POP at pretty much any level.

soaking their damage until controlled are IMO a waste of healing mana and
considerable risk of needing to rez and rebuff that someone.
