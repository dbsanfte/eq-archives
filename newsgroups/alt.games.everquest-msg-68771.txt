Well, you have to pick something at the general category right?

So it's a choice of either regen, sta or running speed.

Regen is attractive and it was a toss up.
STA isn't as critical as my warrior twinkie is a barbarian.
The running speed seemed like a good choice since I pull often and
when pulling and running back to camp, having something beat on you
from behind is generally not too pleasant.

Once I get Innate Running to 3, I'll dump the points into regen.

BTW, this is on my warrior twinkie, not my main.

Travel is rarely a concern (most times when I have to get from point A
to point B, I need a freaking port anyways).

It's the JBoot speed in dungeons that's useful, makes outrunning pulls
very nice (since getting smacked by mobs from behind is bad).

My twink isn't going to raid.  So resists are marginal need.

And even on my main, I'm not too concerned with resists.  His resists
are high enough.

For my warrior twinkie, MAYBE STA if I have a buttload of points left
over.

For my druid, his current WIS is at 324 (it's hard capped at 255, but
by removing some items I was able to figure out what his uncapped WIS
would be).

Stat modifiers given the ridiculously mudiflation going on in this
game isn't a good idea.
