No, that's not what the wife says.

When I made my Dwarven Warrior, I didn't do it intelligently, and he 
doesn't have a lot of stamina.  When I'm not working on skills, I am 
usually duel-wielding a Wurmy and a Viik's Deadly Defender, with a Bee 
Stinger in range, I think.  I picked up one of those Event swords ( 12 / 
26, 5str and 5sta maybe ) and plan on duel-wielding this with the Wurmy 
until I get a Lamentation.

But, my stamina bar drops very very fast, as you can imagine.

I plan on having pretty much full crafted as soon as I take the time to 
pick up the rest of the set.  Are there any STA items you guys can 
recommend for me to pick up?  I don't want to spend a ton of cash, maybe a 
100pp or so, or get the item with my Chanter.

Or, if you can recommend something to replace the Wurm with, that would be 
great.  I don't mind losing a little damage if it lets me afford better 
armor.
