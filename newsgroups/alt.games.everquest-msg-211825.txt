Adding to the "SOE trains us wrong" refrain, I'll point out that
mashing it every time it comes up is a great idea early on in your
carreer, when it practically never works and the only reason to mash it
is to train it up; the sooner you mash it after it comes up the more
cycles per hour you'll see.   I reccomend the same approach for monks
with mend in the early years; try it constantly and never think its
going to work, eventually when you are higher level you'll stop doing
that and start using it when its useful instead.

Warriors (and anyone with taunt) should taunt all they can in any
situation where it can't hurt, early on; and the time when it hurts the
least is when they already have the aggro, noone will ever know they
are mashing it then.

Course up when taunting really starts to matter, when who gets hit is
often the Most important thing, instead of a footnote, everyone saying
Taunt only on Demand is absolutely correct; if you Need taunt, you need
it ASAP, not next time it comes up.
