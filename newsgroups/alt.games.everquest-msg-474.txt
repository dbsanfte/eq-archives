Solo will still be a faster method of advancing. The exp reward will still
be there. For instance, lets assume the bonus goes from the current 2% to
10%, Splitting the exp will still give much less to members of the group. A
group of six kill a mob worth 3000 exp. If the bonus is 10% per person past
the first, then the mob will give 4500 exp, divided by six it's 750 exp each
(assuming of course they are all at identical current exp totals). They will
still have to kill four mobs to get the exp a soloist gets for a single
kill. Lets say they decide to make the bonus really huge, and make it 20%
for every member beyond the first. The same 3000 exp mob will now give 6000
exp, or 1000 exp per group member. The group still has to kill three per
solo kill. Of course, with reduced downtime it might be possible for the
group to pull more than three mobs before the soloist can kill one, but in
many places there will be a limit on how many are available due to spawn
speeds. Personally, I don't think increasing the bonus will impact the
grouping vs. solo situation much at all. What I think it will help is to
fill in three and four person groups. I am often in a smaller group, killing
nicely, and when someone /oocs that they are looking for a group we rarely
invite them. A sizable bonus, in the 10-20% range, and we are going to be
glad to invite them, since they will have a minimal impact on per person
experience while still giving the benefit of their abilities.
