That's the beauty of competition.

The two games are similar in a lot of ways, but different in a few key areas
(solo vs. group, questing vs. hunting).  Having tried both, I prefer WoW,
but that's just me.

I have nothing against EQ2, I just like WoW better.  And amazingly enough,
that seems to be the consensus (on my beta server, at least).

Most of the folks I've seen in WoW beta are EQLive players that have now
tried both games and have decided that the Blizzard philosophy works better
for their level of time committment or gaming style.  We had an interesting
conversation in Brill one night, comparing EQ servers and guilds ... it was
a very good conversation.  There's not much SOE bashing going on ... far
less than I saw in CoH beta.

Objectively, it looks to me like both games will thrive because of their
differences.  I don't think either game is a EQLive killer.  The two of them
combined may well be, though.  It will be interesting to see th enumbers in
EQLive in February, once the launch/Christmas dust settles.

My 2cp, fwiw.
