Foraging isn't an intetaction skill. I was commenting that with all
the AAs like critical hit AA, or the SoS AA. Sure Hide and Sneak are
not class restricted. Even if a character had Hide while Sneaking like
a rogue that would not mean they replaced a rogue.

There is a distinct differenct between an ability and a skill. FD is
an ability, it has a spell version and a skill version. Jewelcraft is
a skill, there is no spell version. I was saying that high level
characters can choose an AA skill of Forage.

No that was my point, playing dead means you stop breathing and appear
magically dead. It is more than laying on your back with a lily in
your hand.

Are you making that much money foraging grease in PoI?
