Haven't really been playing Everquest that long (since dec 03), but the
parts of the game I want to see / do I dont think I ever will. Still have
fun playing it now, but for how much longer, I dont know :)

-
So, am wondering what MMORPG's people are looking to play next, there are
quite a few upcoming games, the problem is, it is only likely that one or
two of them will be played by enough people to make it worthwhile switching
games''''''''''''''''''''''''''
