Ok, having successfully camped Grimrot for both my cleric and paladin, I can
tell you that this is the single, most gruelling camp in EQ.  Grimrot is on
a 3.5 hour spawn timer with a PH of a standind Putrid Skeleton.  The version
of him which spawns is dependant on the time of day when he spawns.  For
example, the Live version spawns when the sun is up, the dead version spawns
when the sun is not up.  However, the PH will most likely spawn instead.  My
longest camp was 72 hours, with no Grimrot pop.  I gave up for a while after
that and returned a few days later and he popped on te third spawn.  If
you're going for broke to get an Aegis, it will take some crazy nights of
camping.  If you want an alternative (and you're a paladin) you can do the
Silent Watch Shield quest, which results in a back slot shield which is AC
10 WIS 10, and is tenfold easier than camping Grimrot.  You can also opt for
a White Bear Pelt cloak (11 AC 5 WIS 50 mana 5 STR 5 MR 75 HP drops rarely
off troopers in Kael) If you're a paladin.   Now my paladin wears the white
bear pelt cloak and the Aegis is sitting in the bank.  If you're a cleric,
there aren't that many easily atainable backslot items that give that kind
of Wisdom and AC.
