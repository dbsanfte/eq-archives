Kezzik the Rogue on the Safehouse ezboard works for
Verant.  He's the guy that helped redo the new RunneyEye,
designed the rogue epic, and designed the Burning
Rapier quest.  He started out as just a player, and was
later employed by Verant to help fix the rogue class
(which every pre-Kunark rogue can attest to needed
fixing) as well as other duties.
