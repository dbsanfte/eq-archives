For my 2cp I'd agree with the Iksar Shammie.  Other then the stats
previously stated, you could level to 35 or 40 and never leave Kunark.  In
addition Iksars tend to level faster then most of the other races (with the
exception of the Kitty's maybe I haven't played them much).  Well, hope this
info helps you out with your decision of your next character.
