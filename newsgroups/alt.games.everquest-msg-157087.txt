My first backstab:  Just got the new skill, practiced in it, and
rushed happily off to Blackburrow.  Down to the resting area, and
found a warrior beset by a gnoll.  Decided to give him some help.
Came up behind the gnoll, hit Backstab, missed totally.  The gnoll
immediately turned around and, despite everything the warrior could
do, promptly beat me to death.

My first serious cash:  Level 12 Mage exploring in W Karana.  I was
wandering along, minding my own business, when a grizzly came up and
proceeded to eat my face.  Started casting, just as a couple of
higher-level people showed up.  Failed.  Tried again.  Failed.  Things
are looking bad.  Tried again.  Success!  Got my pet up to take the
grizzly.  Backed off and proceeded to nuke him into oblivion.  The
people watching were so impressed at my getting the pet off while
being eaten that they gave me 25 Plat as a reward.  Most cash I ever
had for quite a while.

My first werewolf:  Level 12 Druid, teamed with a mage in W Commons.
There we were, beating on a wisp, when someone rushes up and proceeds
to KS us.  It's a bloody WEREWOLF!!!  I break left, run, stop, Gate.
The mage breaks right and boots for zone (he didn't have Gate
memorized).  We both made it out alive.  Never stick around to argue
with a KSsing werewolf.
