I'm attempting to do the variouis Craft Keeper quests (cap, trousers, robe,
etc). This fellow gave me the assembly kit, but now won't give me any of the
patterns.

Anyone else having/had this problem?

I notice that on the websites that talk about this quest the most recent notes
date back to 2003, so was something changed (like a level cap or something)?
