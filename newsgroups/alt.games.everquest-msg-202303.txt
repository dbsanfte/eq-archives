Extended Range is important for a couple of things.  For example, the Lull
line of spells is as useful as the ranger/druid Harmony  line, and works
indoors as well as outdoors.  ER lets you Lull from well outside aggro
range.  If the puller brings in two mobs, targeting one and starting your
mezz at extreme range will halt the add well before it comes into camp.  If
the puller brings in a crowd, an extended-range Mesmerization (group mezz)
will lock down five at long range, giving you more time to target the extras
for single-target mez - and giving you more time to target the mezzed group
for single-mezzes once the group mezz wears off in fifteen seconds.

Mana preservation is nice, but a chanter has mana regen past 16 by
definition.  :)  Extending buff length is not a priority; enchanter buffs
generally last a reasonable length of time (except some haste spells) and
are cheap to cast; it doesn't effect mezzes (dammit!).  Buff haste is nearly
irrelevant.  Spell haste is good, but doesn't effect the PBAOE stuns; still,
it's useful for getting mezzes off faster.

My priority, in order of importance, is Extended Range, Spell Haste, Mana
Preservation, Extended Enchantment, and Enchantment Haste is dead last (I
almost didn't mention it at all).
