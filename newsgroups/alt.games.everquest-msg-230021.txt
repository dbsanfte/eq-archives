Hmmm... that actually raises an interesting point... a good strategy for 
discord could be to two box (or team up with a friend)... level a class 
with some decent combat buffs, and hide him somewhere, and then buff a 
level 6-10 pvp character and laugh your way through.  A druid would be a 
good buff class... great soloers and solid buffer (get him into the 
30s... cast sow, regen, levitate, camoflouge, skin like whatever, damage 
shield on your level 9 pali and charge into a battle... he'll shred 
characters his level who won't immediately bolt when they see him, and 
if/when he gets sniped by by a high level... ... he was level 9... 
create a new one P/L it back to 9 somewhere secluded and away you go...

Hmmm... that only works if the 'scoring' is per account... not per 
character... guess it probably isn't so great... then again a level 9 
sowed and regenerating could conceivably run away from many 25ths...
