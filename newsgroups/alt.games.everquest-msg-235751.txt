YOu learn amazing things when you take some times to browse your spell
vendors and look at the descriptions of those spells. The BST pet
summons have names along the lines of "Spirit of Sharek", however, not
all the "Spirit of..." spells are pet summons. You'll ahve to either
visit an EQ website with spell lists ( www.beasltords.org is great for
BST specific info ) or read up on the descriptions of the spells
in-game at the vendors.
