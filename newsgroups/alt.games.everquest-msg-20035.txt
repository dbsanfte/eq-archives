I am somewhat confused about faction in Velious.
What I understand (so far).
There is dwarf, giant and dragon faction.
Giant and dwarf faction is opposed.  So You raise dwarf faction by killing
giants and you raise giant faction by killing dwarfs. Thurgardin is a dwarf
city so to do buisness there you need to not kill a lot of dwarfs.

             Here is where I am confused.
1. If you want to go beyond GD, EW and Iceclad it seems you have to got
through Kael Drakkel and Wakening Lands.  If you have chosen to go for good
Dwarf faction you are KOS to all the Giants in these areas.  I a player is
in there mid 40s level wise, how do the proceed in Velious.  By 45 you are
running out of blue conning mobs with decent exp in GD and EW.

2. I hear people say they are killing giants for faction, but when I arrived
in Thurgardin everyone conned "regards warmly" to me and I had killed few if
any giants at that time.

3.  How do the dragons figure into this.  Killing giants improves faction
with Dragons? When and how does this come into play.

4. Can you pass through the southern/lower part of Kael Drakkel to Wakening
lands without aggroing giants?

5.  I see people put all this effort into the prayer shawl qwests, is the
final shawel worth all that effort.

6. Are the high level parties which raid Icewell Keep under/beneath
Thurgardin, killing dwarfs because they have decided to gain Giant faction
and do not mind being KOS to dwarfs and in Thurgardin.

7. I naturally assumed as a good character, I should work on keeping good
dwarf faction.  What is the benifit of giant faction.  If I had killed
dwarfs mecelessly from day one, would I be welcome in Kael Drakkel and
Wakening lands?

Any general, guidance or answers would be much appreciated.
