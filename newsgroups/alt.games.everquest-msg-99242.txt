I wouldn't take the other's advice about damage shield then jump into a lot
of critters...that will only get a level 48 bard killed.

All you need to do is find a place where there's plenty of blues nearby, and
a safe place to pull to.  A damage shield is fine, but the PotG buff, SoW,
SNARE, and his nukes are what is going to be important to PLing...even a
bard (snare/sow are 2 less songs you have to juggle).

By now I'm sure that you know of a few places, but I'd first recommend a
dungeon (SolB and LGuk spring to mind), but if you're afraid of the indoors
and don't mind being KOS to Gorenaire & Talendor, Skyfire is a great place
to be, because it drops high level spells.

Once the critter gets below half health (about 1/3 health if the damage
shield was used often) the druid can safely nuke it into oblivion.  If the
level 48 bard isn't ebayed or simply stupid, I'm sure that he can easily
improve on my basic suggestions.
