AE kiting died a long, long time ago when they nerfed extended range.
Yes, it's still *possible*, but the risk is so incredibly high there's
no point. This is just insult to injury.

Only part I'm afraid of is that now they're starting to force bards to
stand still to use the full potential of songs, whats to stop them from
doing that on our AE resists or mana song?
