Three years in Federal Prison for distributing your opinion in a
supermarket!

The Fortune 500 Nation is opposed to Free Speech and they have told
the ACLU to "Jump!" and the ACLU has replied "How high!"

While everyone is rightly concerned about controls on the internet the
good old fashioned kind of Free Speech is being eliminated off the
net. Once that happens they will eliminate Free Speech online in short
order and the clamp down will be complete.

Where's the ACLU? Busy mailing out solicitations asking for more
money! Where are the rest of the attorneys? Crafting the legislation
to eliminate Free Speech!

Thomas Paine gets three years in the joint!

THE NATION
Hate-Filled Groceries Called Disturbing Trend
  
By TYNISA E. TRAPPS, TIMES STAFF WRITER


WASHINGTON -- For Thanksgiving dinner last year, David Burris decided
to make strawberry cheesecake for dessert. Opening a box of cake mix,
the Baker City, Ore., businessman found a slip of paper that he
thought at first was a coupon.

But a closer look gave him a rude shock. The paper was inscribed with
a Nazi swastika and hate-filled racial slurs against African
Americans.

Burris is one of hundreds of consumers nationwide who in recent years
have found offensive leaflets inserted into packages of goods ranging
from cereal to frozen pizzas to toilet paper. The propaganda has
included graphic depictions of late-term abortions, racist tracts and
anti-immigrant leaflets. On Wednesday, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee
held a hearing on proposed legislation that would make putting such
information into packaged goods illegal. The Product Package
Protection Act would reinforce existing laws against food tampering
and place stiff penalties on vandals who deface product packaging.

Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.), who introduced the bill last week to
address what manufacturers see as a "continuing problem," said the
distribution of obscene material is a disturbing trend. California and
New Jersey are the only two states that have passed laws criminalizing
such acts of tampering, according to Kohl's office.

"Too many Americans have recently opened groceries and found
offensive, racist, anti-Semitic, pornographic and hateful leaflets,"
Kohl said.

Burris, who testified before the Senate panel, agreed, saying he
initially thought "this might be some sort of joke. But I realized it
wasn't. If [such information] can be inserted [inside of a box], what
can these people do to the product?"

According to the Grocery Manufacturers of America, consumers lodge
from 200 to 500 complaints a year about objectionable literature or
propaganda they find inside packaged products. In most of those
cases--including Burris'--the material is placed between the outer
cardboard packaging and the sealed goods inside.

Peter Cleary, spokesman for the grocers' group, estimated in an
interview that for every complaint his organization receives, as many
as 50 other consumers may have encountered similarly tampered packages
but did not report them.

Kraft Foods North America has received 80 complaints of tampering
since 1997. General Mills has documented an additional 25 cases a
year, and Kellogg's reports many more.

Kohl's bill would prohibit the placement of any writing or other
material inside a product without the manufacturer's permission.
Penalties would include a fine of up to $250,000 per offense and up to
three years in prison.
