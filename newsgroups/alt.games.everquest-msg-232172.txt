I do exactly the same, and also dump HTML mail from people not in my 
address book or previous recipient lists. Those simple rules seems to 
eat 90% of spam, and Apple Mail's good Bayesian algorithms seem to take 
care of the rest. I've had this email address since '96, and it probably 
is in every single spam list out there... if it wasn't for some heavy-
handed filtering, I probably wouldn't be able to use it at all.

If you ran a Unix system, it would be relatively easy to get Procmail to 
pipe the messages through the spell checker, and take action regarding, 
say, the number of misspelled words, but your problem then would be 
false positives.

I have noticed a serious reduction in the amount of spam I've been 
getting since Christmas (and I was around the thousand-a-day mark), but 
it could be just my mail server providers taking unilateral action.
