You're defining society too narrowly.

There most certainly is a single human society.  What you call
societies I would call cultures.  It was a more-or-less united single
human society which defeated Nazi Germany.  Sure, there were neutrals
for one reason or another, but by the end of the war the vast majority
of the world's nations were participants.

Name me one human culture which condones murder of its own kind, as
Stalin did.  Name me a single major human culture which doesn't
attempt to safeguard the property of its citizens.  Give me one
example of a culture where some form of marriage does not exist and
where some provision for the rearing of the young in the absence of
the usual methods does not exist.

All human cultures are in fact astonishingly similar, given how
different they *could* be, and there is a very good reason for this.
A civilization needs to provide certain basic things for its citizens
or it will whirl apart.  Whether or not you are religious, morality
provides people with guidelines so that they may behave in a
"civilized" (i.e., useful to their civilization) manner.  And the
moralities of all cultures, while obviously having some differences
with each other, will again by and large be very similar.

And what I was saying is that good and evil is whatever the majority
of the society of the human *species* says it is.  If in any given
case there is not total agreement then we must go with what the
majority believe.

Anathema however to any civilization is the extreme individualist,
since he cannot be controlled and has interests directly at odds with
those of the civilization.

Which is why I gave a definition of evil as "an insistence upon self
to the exclusion and detriment of others."  I know of no culture on
this earth who will condone this attitude, save in its absolutely
mildest forms.
