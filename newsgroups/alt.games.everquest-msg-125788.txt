Hmm, I will test this if I remember to, but I can assure you that if
it works this way now, it has not always been so:

Example #1:
Starting unbuffed, I cast 2 junk buffs on self and follow with standard
buff lineup, then clicked off junk buffs.  Next, with buff slots 1 and
2 open, I engaged a necro mob who likes to root/dot and let his pet beat
on you.  Soon afterwards I am dotted and rooted, and while I can clear
the dot with the appropriate disease or poison cure, Cancel Magic goes
after my buffs first.  Also tried this using Pumice to cast Nullify
Magic, same result except buffs were dispelled on fewer casts.  Result
of this was that I never worry about being Rooted unless I have to flee,
in which case I click off all my buffs as fast as I can and then dispell
the Root.

Example #2:
Fighting Brownies in LFay, with SoW appended to my usual self cast
buffs, if I had refreshed my buffs more recently than SoW the Brownie's
Cancel Magic would wipe SoW, if I made sure to always get at least a
couple of my buff refreshes in before SoW refresh the SoW always stayed
up.

Since these experiences I have never seen an exception to this, tho I
can't recite specific additional instances off-hand (these stick in my
mind because they were the experiences from which I learned the
behavior of Cancel/Nullify).  In fact, I used to wonder why people
were wasting time with junk buffs for raids until somebody pointed out
specificly that the AOE buff wiping dragons do acts differently than
Cancel/Nullify.
