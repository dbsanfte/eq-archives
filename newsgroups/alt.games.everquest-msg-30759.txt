My guild has been planning a little Mistmoore mini-raid so all of the 
Warriors could get the talon for the Crafted BP quest, but thanks to a 
scheduling conflict, I wont be able to join them tomorrow night...a Rogue 
guildmate offered to get the talon for me, and once I buy the rubies, he 
said he would turn it in (since the talon is no-drop) and give me the BP. 

I know the BP can only be used by warriors, but can other classes do the 
quest?
