We are not a signatory to the geneva conventions but thats minor since we
are far more moral than anyone else. The geneva conventions only apply to
soldiers fighting openly, no other combatant is protected by them.

I do not accept that the victims in abu grev where conscripts, I believe
that they comprise the worst dregs of humanity. I believe that the soldiers
in trouble now where given orders to make life difficult for the prisoners
and that a blind eye was turned . I do not believe such conduct is at all
becomming. I dont mind the torture by intelligence officers so much but
telling someone else to do it for you is about as low as you can go.
Particularly if who you are telling is young and easily suggestable.

Multiply the countries by there populations and what is it? 90% death
penalty? And how many of those nice countries without it would you feel safe
as an innocent man in there court system?
