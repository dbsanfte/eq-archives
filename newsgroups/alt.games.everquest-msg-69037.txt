I had this happen yesterday! Logged in on Innoruk server was running around
with my newly created Vah Shir Beastlord and talking to NPCs. I recieved a
tell saying "you really should speak common you're no good at erudite". I
sent a tell back to him saying i didn't know what he was talking about and
received back "lol, I can't understand you at all N M". Looked at my
language and sure enough it was Erudite (and the skill list said very bad),
no wonder he couldn't understand me. I think it must be a bug, I have no
chars who have ever used the language in question.
