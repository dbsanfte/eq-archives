you're forgetting that part of Rumble's theory on why flags are good
is that it *promotes* guilds cohesion.  My experience as an officer
in a family guild of low 50's to low 60's is the exact opposite.  The
players like me who entered PoP early and leveled to the point where
Tier 1 zones were becoming a tad tedious were frustrated that our guild
couldn't field a full group with the DPS to get through.  Instead they
found pickup groups, and some managed to get through - at which point
we had discontent from the lower level members because folks were 
arranging guild groups in zones where they couldn't go.  I was in many
conversations every day - trying to keep the higher level folks from
moving on, and trying to get the high 50's folks in groups in tier one
to get them leveled so we could progress as a guild.  I, along with
the other officers, failed - the guild came apart as people leveled past
60 and moved to other guilds who could flag them.  The guild my RL
buddy moved to had a dedicated group of 64/65 folks (cleric/sk/wiz/wiz/
'chanter) that pulled the non DPS classes through the trials and got
them flagged.  I tried the trials at least 50 times in pickup groups.
Not shitty pickup groups either - they were folks I met early in PoP
and we were able to handle camps like consorts (level 60+ spiders) and
Hobgoblins with no problems, but were just short of the DPS necessary
to complete the trials.  That's because the were friends - and they weren't
leaving the non-dps classes behind.  Of course, by your theory - they're
leeches and should be dumped on the side of the road so we can advance.
