The argument was that only the likes of FoH's primary casters would ever
come into contact with the mana cap, so the only people who benefit from
the change are the couple of dozen of them across all servers combined.

The reality, which is what they've been trying to prove in this thread,
is that literally 1000s of people across the servers are either above,
or in sight of, that cap. The reality is that the toughest mobs you have
to kill are Cazic level. Certainly not a walkover, but also not Emperor
Ssra level either. 

I've got a RL friend in a guild on Zeb. Not what one would call 'uber',
just a L60 orientated guild. The toughest mob they've taken down as a
guild is Vindi. Cazic is beyond them, though they do kill the demis. The
sometimes do HoT for armor. That's just to give you an idea of their
'level' in the general scheme of things.

So, if they aren't raiding 6 days a week, what are they doing? Usually
gaining huge amounts of AA, and very often they're doing it in CT. No,
L55 characters won't do well in CT because it's designed as a L58+ zone.
They most certainly have access to the vast majority of what was listed.

Let's face it, if you were hitting the mana cap at L55 without any loot
above Kunark dragons, there'd be something BADLY wrong with the game.
Further to that, it would've come to light when the first people to
reach L55 with Kunark dragon loot noticed they couldn't actually cast
more. Kinda like what happened, just at a different time in the
'history' of EQ

Also, look into the future. In 6 months time, do you really foresee
yourself NOT being at (or near) the mana cap yourself? The game
progresses, and what was previously the domain of ubers, is now
commonplace. I remember cobalt being UBER, now there's smithed armor
(for a high price) that's better than most people can ever loot in
certain slots. Hell, I'm wearing Fierce Heraldic on head, bracer,
bracer, shoulders, and I'm still collecting components for legs. I have
LESS cash than most L60s who have lots of time to camp drops in places
like CT. 

I simply fail to see how removing the cap on +mana could be anything but
a *good thing*<tm>. Even if FOH are among the first to benefit, they
most certainly won't be the only ones to benefit.
