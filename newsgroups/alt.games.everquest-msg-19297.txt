Ok, my guild is planning a knock-em-down: guildie
against guildie (all in good fun.) I have a
halfling druid, 27th level, who will be fighting a
27th level human bard; I would value
recommendations on strategy.

In particular:

* Are bard songs considered magic? And would
increasing my MR help reduce damage done by /
effects of her songs?

* Do a bard's songs have greater, equal, or
shorter distance than my spells?

* Does anyone have suggestions for nifty tricks
that might be effective?

Under the rules of engagement, we will start on
the "blocks" in the Arena. Neither of us start out
buffed, and we have 15 seconds after we begin to
buff and/or relocate before we can engage.
