App I spells are acquired at certain points as you level. 
App II spells can be purchased from vendors if this has not 
changed since beta. App III spells are player made. (not 
sure if they drop as well, never saw a single spell drop in 
beta). App II's are more powerful than I's and so on. When 
you scribe a II, it overwrites the I as will III's overwrite 
II's.

If your button bar was full, then the spell dropped into 
your spellbook. It may also have been placed on the second 
bar, but of this I'm not sure.
