It was a joke about how pathetic clerical melee is as a damage tool ):oP

ie: Don't worry about it - they're both such small numbers, that any
actually 'difference' in dps will be exponentially small.


You see, there's incongruity in your post that I just don't understand. 

On the one hand you're saying you like to melee for a little fun,
knowing it contributes nothing substantial to the fight. You only do it
when there is no risk to your group and you can stay at (or near) full
mana while playing around. Go for your life, we all like to have fun. I
take a huge AC hit to wear my bright orange Ragefire suit sometimes for
example. I don't care about the difference in damage taken at the time,
because if it mattered, I wouldn't be doing it.

Then on the other hand, you're concerned about the very slight
difference in your melee damage output contribution to the fight, down
to dps differences between weapons.

I'll put it to you bluntly. I doesn't matter WHICH weapon you use. If
you have an easy enough camp to melee, where healing isn't draining your
mana, then your increase in damage to the mob from melee isn't going to
increase your kill rate.

By all means, have fun meleeing, but your dps will be immaterial. How do
you think these 'combat tables' are worked out? By people extensively
logging and parsing damage output over a huge sample set under
controlled conditions. Then they compare and contrast those logs, and
come out with a theory as to the table and equations. Those in turn are
then tested by other people to corroborate or disprove them. Frankly,
no-one is bothered enough about cleric melee doing 8dps or 10dps to make
the effort to work it out. Coplands doesn't have calculations for
anything but war/pal/sk/rng/brd/rog/mnk (not on my version at least)
probably for that very reason.

Against exp mobs, you will do more damage from nuking and medding back,
than you're ever likely to do from meleeing.
