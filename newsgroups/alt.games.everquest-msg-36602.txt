I highly doubt that they would bother to put in such
"success tracking" stats and compensation.  There would
be little reason for it, and it would add a lot of complexity
to the code, *and* require several extra data fields
in the character database.

More likely, you're just seeing an age-old property of
the random distributions, which is that they tend to
"cluster" more often than you'd intuitively expect.
