The earring is the earring of veracity line of quests.

http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=4076.topic

I have got up to the 2nd one, its not great on its own but would be at
low level.. of course you'd die at low level when you gave the note to
the file cabinet and got a new one... hmm.. but really if you were low
level why would dying matter?

Wow.. it just occured to me that a character of binding level could do
this quest pretty well even on a new server if it had 60 plat (for the
drink) and some way to invis (for getting to the guy in neth) and
enough baking skill to make bixie crunchies (not that hard) all for a
2 ac 2 str 2 sta 2 wis earring. The only other requirement is being
non kos in seru.. and either being with a tracker/tracking or knowing 
where the npcs are from another server.

The first earring was the same stats but 1, the third is 6 (making it
best for those who cant wear ivandyrs hoop.. or since both ivandyrs
and this earring are lore they make a nice combo) and the final one is
15 the same stats. Both the 6 and 15 one have some nice spell add ons
as well.

The 4 reports/houses he was talking about are mentioned in that thread
I pointed out. For the third earring, 6 all of the same things, you
need 4 reports to combine in the satchel you get upon giving the note
to a rogue in katta (after getting the 2nd earring) Supposedly the
reports might be very rare and you might only get one in 30 hours of
killing level 60 mobs (with several friends) Someone in that thread
thinks that perhaps the person from each house nearest a port wall may
always drop it though, or they got very lucky.
