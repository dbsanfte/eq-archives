|Dennis, first off, I agree. And that is our choice and our dollars.

	The problem is that all these developers are wasting their time with a
form of game that is doomed to fail in the long run (because it always has).
That's a lot of money and effort being thrown away.

	If we are ever really going to get an EQ-killer, it will come from
developers who recognized PvP as the dead end it is.  So far, no one is even
on the right track.  (It remains to be seen how important PvP is to Blizzard's
entry.)

|Second, I have never heard of Chandlers Art of Murder. Can you give me a
|synopsis that would encvourage me to pick it up? thank you.

	It's a compilation of short stories with one essay, from which it draws
its title, on the writing of detective fiction.  Primarily noteworthy for the
"Down these mean streets..." passage.
