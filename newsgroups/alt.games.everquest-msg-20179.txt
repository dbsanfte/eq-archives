Hello-

Couple of questions

Picked up Skull of Jen Thra(not sure on spelling).....
I am under the impression thats its druid only....but what is it and what
does it do and how do i use it?


How does Dual Wield work and what should i xpect out of it with respect to
my ranger?

Is it worth giving up my shield?

Thanks you all for your help

    -kris.
