Bah, everybody is stupid one of these days. ;-)
Down in the Hole, we're camped on the balcony just before the dropoff.
We've killed the Rock Golem, all the cruisers, and the elementals up to
the stairs. Still about ten minutes till re-spawn. We decide to pull the
three mobs in the tower with the locked/unpickable door. You can't hit
them with arrows. They were too far away from the door to aggro by
sitting next to it. We only have one caster in the group, and that's
Tiru. (Then 54 cleric).

Me: Hey, I've got an idea! I've got one targeted, so Tiru can assit me
and nuke that one, then I'll get aggro when they come down and we'll
fight them here on the balcony!

She lasted about ten seconds. I didn't even make it to the door.
/em sighs, clearly disappointed.
