I'm starting to doubt whether the SBC even exists <g>. Either that or
it's like the ODS and drops mainly off of the lower lvl mobs close to
zone, never hunted zone in/out much. And that was after spending a LOT
of time in Seb from 50-60. Sebilis and the Hole where the two zones
that got me most of my exp between 50 and 60.

I really hate the fact that PoP but an end to the good dungeon zones
like that. Even increasing the spread for blues won't help matters
any. Those zones will still be trivial even if they are blue again and
nothing in PoP really compares. 

It's probably worth noting that all the RBGs I've seen (3) have been
off of Krups, which would probably make the Chef camp a prime spot if
you want one. 

And the point about buying one is  a good one, nothing beats a camp
like scarabs in Seb for pure money loot. 

<--- still slums there occasionally for plat
