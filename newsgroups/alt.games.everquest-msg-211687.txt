Very well said.  This bothers me a -lot-.  Now admittedly, I only speak 
about 8-10 words of any of the relevant langauges (Aramaic?  Heh, not even 
one. :) ) And none of those are particularly useful words even.  Sure, if 
someone says "ekfaristo" in the Greek New Testament, I may actually spot 
that they mean either please or thank you, but big frickin' deal, eh? :)

And to make matters even worse, languages change over time (as one of your 
examples there touched on with Paul making up a new word.)  And nowadays 
we have not just Hebrew and Greek, but also Biblical Hebrew and Biblical 
Greek, which purportedly keep to the old traditions of how Hebrew and 
Greek were spoken back in the day.  But those languages, and how they are 
translated, have also evolved... they'd have to have, in order to be 
translated into, say, English, for example, which didn't even exist for a 
good 6-8 centuries after the biblical era, and then only in a form almost 
completely unrecognizable to a modern reader.  

And basically, the situation you arrive at is that we really have very 
little idea what the original speaker may have meant by such and such 
a word, and it becomes entirely the province of the translator to try and 
pick the words that will start the fewest possible Holy Wars directed at 
them.  And many of these translators were working under exactly that sort 
of duress (look up the history of the King James Version sometime, if you 
want a really ugly, sordid, little soap opera.)

But, if I want a Bible to thump, I'll still thump KJV.  It's the only 
version, in my opinion, that has enough 'ye's and 'thou's to sound 
properly holy.

<hand-waving rationalization>
But it's the perfect Word of God!  He is infallible, and it's his Word, so 
obviously, he wouldn't have let the translators screw it up!  He stepped 
in and guided them with His Divine Hand, and so the words that they wrote 
are His words, and my interpretation of my preacher's interpretation 
of their interpretation of His words can be the only right one!
</hand-waving rationalization>

Yea, right.  When the Clue Fairy stops by, be sure to ask her for a double 
helping.  Oh, wait, you don't believe in Clue Fairies, do you?  Boy are 
you ever SOL.
