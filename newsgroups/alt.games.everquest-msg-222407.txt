Word of Vigor....group ae heal. Can cast it while doing an emergency
off-tank without having to retarget. But on the whole I agree about
preferring to give my full attention to healing.

WoV is also great as a pallative in case of an abrupt group health hit 
from a trap, dont have to take the time to target, just hit the hotkey 
and zap. At 57 there is an upgrade, Word of Restoration that does the 
same as a sup heal combined with a cure poison/cure disease, again it 
will be great for those annoying poison/disease traps...
