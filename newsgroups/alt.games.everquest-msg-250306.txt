SOE-approved character sales that is. I know that people
buy characters and gear - I've seen how much money
IGE are making. SOE don't sanction it though, so there's
not much you can do about it, the only thing I can do is
stop visiting sites that Yantis bought out (Im sure he's
crying himself asleep, I know ;P)

The moment SOE start condoning it, every penny you
put in their hands sends a message to other MMORPG
companies that it's a good idea, and that's where I have
a problem. MMORPG's and persistant online worlds
are held together by the integrity that cheats and quick
leg-ups erode. So that's why I'd be inclined to make a
personal decision not to endorse it if it happened
