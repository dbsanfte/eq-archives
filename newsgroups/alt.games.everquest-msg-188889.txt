velium fire opal rings, gold/electrum black sapphire earrings (whichever
is the one with more hp) should come pretty cheap.  

Acrylia studded cloak will fall into your price range.

velium ruby veil is a nice cheap piece of strength/wisdom gear (but dump
it for something with ac/hp once you get into your 20s). 

grey flesh stuff is nice, as is haze panther stuff, but probably on the
pricey side. 

Someone else mentioned a tree weave, which is a nice and cheap leather
bp. 

waterlogged britches out of LoY look nice for legs (not no drop).
