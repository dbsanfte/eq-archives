One small warning about this driver update. I had it installed a while back; but
had to remove it because it gave my CD burner indigestion. Couldn't burn a thing
while the updated drivers were in; the process would start, then stop
immediately without burning a thing onto the blank disk. Once I uninstalled it,
the burner worked fine again.
