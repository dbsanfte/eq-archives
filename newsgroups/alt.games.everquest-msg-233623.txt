My Gnome Wizard has come across very few merchants that refuse to serve 
him.  The only one I can think of off hand is a merchy in Neriak that you 
have to buy some wizzy spells from.  He absolutly won't sell to my Gnome, 
so I made a DE wizard alt to buy the spells.  Get a bit better deal on 
them, too.
