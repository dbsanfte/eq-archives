Having gotten a RL couple (friends) hooked on EQ, they are already
udergoing the inevitable transformation from playing two characters on
one account/computer to figuring out how they are going to get that
second computer and account so they can play together.
  This led to a discussion last night about what classes they could best
play together for happy, productive advancement in Norrath, and to my
explaining a bit about dynamic duos.  But I'm still not positive about
what the best combination would be to suggest.  They currently play a SK
(him) and a Ranger (her) but I mentioned that this is probably not
optimum as they have no healer. I've done the monk/shaman thing to the
mid twenties, and the Warrior/Cleric to high 30's/low 40's.  Both of
these seem pretty effective.  But I'm also told that a druid/necro team
can be damn near unbeatable and will rarely, if ever need a full group
to hunt for many, many levels. The down side to that would seem to be
that they could wind up in their 40's with no real grouping skills, and
maybe not even have made a lot of friends or gotten into a guild.
   All three of those pairing seem to be pretty promising, but what do
you suppose the relative merits to each are so I could let them know?
And have I missed any other combo's that have worked really well for
people?
