1.  Due to the way pets are handled now, they can't be agro'd onto without
help, so you will have to get the pet to hit one of the mobs somehow for
them to turn on it.  How you do it is up to you.

2.  I would use the arrow keys for movement, and your hotkey bank to
start/stop songs.  Most bards I know will have their hotkey banks set up
with their songs as the first 8 slots on the hotkey bank.  This means to
start or stop a song all you have to do is hit the number key instead of
moving your mouse and will allow you faster access to your song arsenal.

3.  I personally use the first person view for all my kiting so not sure on
how easy the 3rd person view is, but remember, if you don't have to
concentrate on what song you are trying to move your mouse to and just
hitting the corresponding number key, you'll have a much easier time
concentrating on where you and the mobs are.
