<< snip hugely fun-sounding adventures >>

I found the game getting a little tedius recently and decided to try
Firona Vie for something different. I created a bard and went to work
hacking away at newbie fodder. Then started the fun task of obtaining
my newbie quest armor (brilliant additions to the newbie cities,
Sony/VI).

I have been twinking alts for so long that I had forgotten how fun and
adventurous it is to actually scratch for all the stuff you get. The
RP aspect is quite fun as well. I would recommend it to anyone.
