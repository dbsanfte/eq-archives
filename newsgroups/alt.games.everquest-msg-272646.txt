Sure, and one type being preferable doesn't really bother me. There's
a difference between an encounter being easier with certain classes
and being impossible w/o certain classes.

I was thinking of some of the named mobs in PoP, a couple that I'd
watch an enchanter/druid duo but couldn't be taken down by our full
