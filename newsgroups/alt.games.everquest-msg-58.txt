Melee classes that venture into one way dungans or plains. It is always
advisable to have one, its not used offten but I always keep one on me and
one in the bank. We had a nice little group in a keasorta shammy . chanter ,
cleric warrior, mag and a rouge.... and we where not going to go from one
side to the other warrior aand rouge, but warrior especially where very
happy to have one.

Some time a druid or a wiz might not be around and if they are,  and you
have to leave at bad time cause something come up its nice to have one. The
problem has always been price. But if you loot few nice items from a dungen
then it pays for it self.
