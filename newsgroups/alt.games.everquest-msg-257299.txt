Saw that in your posts on NS. So damned jealous. :p I've got issues...
I'm not encouraged by seeing people who do better than me, it makes me
throw my hands up in frustration over the shortcomings of my own work.
:( I know it's not the way I should look at it, but.... *shrugs* It's
a long, hard climb, and being at the bottom makes it daunting.

It really is beautiful. Really cool that she can do all that with
pixel art...
