I LOVE the new version of EQ.  In fact, I just love this damn game, full
stop (period, if you prefer).  I don't CARE that it takes up all my time,
it's great.  And the new character models are fantastic.  I love the way you
can change your appearance mid-game.  I love the little tweaks and frills
they've put in over the year I haven't been playing it.  I think it just
goes on getting better.

And I KNOW I'm supposed to bitch about it but I'm not going to.  No.  I
refuse.

Well, I'm not going to YET.  Give it a couple of weeks...

:o)
