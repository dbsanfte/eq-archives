Yeah, but there are some items I'd like to get and I get bored to
easily farming Hill Giants with my druid to make plat.  A ranger solo
in a dungeon doesn't sound like a creature with a long life expectancy
to me.

At some point I just think it will be more fun to group up with
Atticus.  The thing I like about the ranger though is really that I
won't actually ever HAVE to group, until the way high end of the game.
