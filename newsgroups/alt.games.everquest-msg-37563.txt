I am not sure how the experience is, but you might look into the
Interrogator's Badge quest in Qeynos.

I just did the previous part of the quest, the Inspector's Badge (which
you will have to do first, as well), and it gave great exp at 25
(especially doing it multiple times to get it right). If the second part
is as good as the first, you should be able to get some decent exp. I
haven't read a walkthrough for the quest, but did peek at Allakhazam's
to see the recommended level for the second part, which he has listed at
30+.

Give it a shot, it's a pretty decent quest; better storyline and very
different from any other quest I've done. If you want to know how to get
started, and don't want to read a quest-spoiler, do like I did and buy a
newspaper from the guy near the bank in Qeynos =)
