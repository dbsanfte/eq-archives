This was my point, you don't actually use the various spell lines you 
get enough leveling up to 24 to raise the skill in them, nor really your 
own personal skill in using them.

Nor is this unique to chanters.  A mantra I've often recounted is 
"Verant trains us wrong".  (of course I've been saying it so long that 
its no longer Verant thats nominally to blame, now its SOE, sort of)  
Early on we are all pretty good melee damage dealers and sponges.  Our 
spells don't matter much if at all, at first, in fact hybrids don't get 
them at all till 9.  Key spells or abilities, like Cannibalize (24) 
won't show up at all till higher levels (heck, consider Jolt, what is 
that, level 51?), strategies that work well at low levels -don't- work 
well at high levels, strategies that are necessary at high levels are 
decidedly inefficient at low levels. Learning to be a good chanter might 
be easier at 24 if you -don't- come at it with the baggage you 
mislearned from 1 to 23.

Matte, level 30 chanter with 57 bard expectations as to melee 
assisting... but playing with groups who assist about as well as level 
12 melee's.
