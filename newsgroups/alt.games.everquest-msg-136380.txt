Find a wizard or druid to port you into Skyfire. Make sure you are invis
before you go. (Everything in that zone will take your lunch money and
make you cry.) When you land, have a map handy, but run to the wall and
hoof it to the left. You will eventually come to the passage that leads
to the Overthere. Much safer insertion point than the Evil Outpost,
though that can be done safely too by swimming. But if you can grab a
ride, this will be quicker, and not much riskier if you keep your wits
about you. Most of the Skyfire mobs run very slowly, also. With your SoW
you will easily outdistance them even if cammo drops. Just don't get
hit. At your level, I doubt you'd last more than one shot.
