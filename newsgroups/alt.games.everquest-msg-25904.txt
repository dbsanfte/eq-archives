Doesn't the ability to heal (be it clerical, druidic or shamanistic)
technically come from one's god?   If the god of one race doesn't
particularly like the god of another race (one reason for two races being at
war), then why would said god allow one of his/her priests to heal the
follower of an enemy?  Regardless of the intentions of the healer, it
probably wouldn't be allowed to happen.
