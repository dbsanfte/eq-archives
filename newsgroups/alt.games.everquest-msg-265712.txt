Whether people or machines can be trusted to count cards isn't the 
issue, the fact that large numbers of cards, oddly enough all from 
districts likely to vote democrat, were lost or "unreadable" while few 
cards from districts likely to vote republican had these troubles was... 
troubling.  Disenfranchising voters destroys democracy, if you don't 
count everyone's vote then you really aren't basing leadership on voters 
choice at all.

When did I mention "majority of the popular vote?"  Plurality would be 
fine, given more than two choices available.  In the 2000 election 
however, more people voted for Bush Lite's opponent than voted for him. 
  If Ohio had gone just a hair the other way this time, the situation 
would have been reversed, more people voting for Bush II than for Kerry, 
yet Kerry winning the electoral college.

I also did not say that I voted against Bush League -because- he should 
have lost the first time.  I mentioned it only because I was showing 
exactly how slim the margin by which I agreed with the OP that W 
"increased his mandate"... which is to say from negative (less than net 
0) to extremely small positive (a bare 1% lead)

To me, a "Mandate" comes from winning by a large margin, the larger the 
margin the more persuasive the mandate.  The closer you are in numbers 
to losing, the more you ought to be looking at compromising with your 
opponent in order to try and represent the country as a whole.
