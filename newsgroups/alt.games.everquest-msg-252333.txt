In defense of the new hires of the 90s, the smell of money got to some
of the industry vets as well. Origin and Sirtech both went down that
road with leadership from the top.

Yeah, I recall more than a few manuals in the 80s that were just
mimeographed on looseleaf copier paper, folded over and stapled. These
days, a company could make a homegrown manual that was much better and
didn't cost any more to publish. And that would be fine by me, I don't
need a manual for a computer game that looks like something I'd buy at
Barnes & Noble.

Well, maybe so, but I've worked for small businesses before that
manage to deliver quality products at a low cost. It can be done. What
can't be done is things like having twice as many salesman and three
times as many customer service reps as you have programmers. Not if
you want to keep costs down. A big business mentality relies on
extremely high volume to offset low profit margins. That's the wrong
business model to use for a niche market. Of course, they weren't
aware that they were selling into a niche market, apparrently.

Visual C++ !!

When they released it in 1992 it instantly and forever changed the
nature of software development. I've been using it just about every
day for 14 years.

There are plenty of other examples, I just mention that one because
it's had the biggest impact on me, personally. Maybe you don't
consider something like that innovative, because it wasn't the first C
compiler, but it was a quantum leap ahead of anything that had been
done before - and it contained many features that had never previously
been seen in any software product, let alone compiler.

Actually, I'm hoping that the new Holy Grail platform will be for
techies and hobbyists like the PC was in the old days... the soccer
moms and daytona dads can keep the PC. It lets em do their online
shopping and checking accounts just fine :D
