Aha! Shlotsky's (sp?)!  I'll bet they're that other place with the green 
and red logo that wiped out my favorite cafe!

An informal poll of some neighbors:

Love the commercial, love Quiznos, eat there all the time: 
  1 votes
Love Quiznos, the commercial's a bit scary, will still eat there:
  2 votes
Used to like Quiznos, but won't eat there now that they have scary rats:
  1 vote (my girlfriend)
What's Quiznos?  Those rats are ick.  Should I be scared?
  1 vote (me)

So the question is, what's scariest?
 (a) The rats' eyes?
 (b) Their mouths?
 (c) Their chalkboard-scratchy voices?

For further discusion:  They say you can get a dollar off with any coupon.  
Any coupon at all.  What's the weirdest coupon you could think of taking 
them?

And, on the subject of green and red logos... I love the Emerald Nuts 
commercials.  Envious Nomads!  Evil Navigators!  Bwahahahha.

Mmm.  Time for more coffee.
