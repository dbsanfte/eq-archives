Well my experience with sub 150 MR is that its like a security
blanket, may make you feel better but wont do crap. Before the resist
changes 100-150 was doing well now its just insane. First thing that
happens is you get hit with a debuff to MR (assuming they know what to
do) and if that sticks and lowers you to sub 100 then you are prob
toast. Now granted many classes cant debuff MR but enough can to make
it a problem. Dont be happy with anything less than 200MR.

As for poison/disease this is necro/shammy land. It is effective and
hurts but doesnt carry the same wieght as snare darkness root etc. I
like the OPs choice of chanter in the group coupled with a necro, good
range there.

The problem with x-teams is this;
Group consists of 2 shortys an a human, shorty necro pair comes along
and ganks human while group mates stand around and watch unable to do
anything. Wish I had a plat for everytime Ive seen this happen.
