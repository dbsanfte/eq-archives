If that's the case, I apologize to you, Tyger.

However, I disagree.  I think we should hit a few WRONG targets, too.  Not
talking about civilians (though undoubtedly they'll die).

Hit Bin Laden...where we suspect he is...perhaps a few places where we
expect he is until the Afgans decide maybe to play ball and turn him over.
Hit Arafat.
Hit Kadafi (I don't think it's possible to misspell his name using our
letters).

Don't nuke a damned thing but yeah, beat the shit outta them and their
supporters.  So next time one of those crazies says "hey, I think my band of
cowards will strike terror into American hearts," the others might say,
"WHAT??? You fucking KIDDING me, man??  If you do that *I* will kick your
ass!  I'm just rebuilding from the LAST time some moron attacked them."

In America, do convicted and released arsonists enjoy being dragged into the
police station every time there's a fire?

In America the drug dealers, mafia and other scum don't kill a cop and
expect to live.  It's just not done.  I think it's time for foreign nations
& insane groups to learn that you just don't attack America and expect to
live.

Why are you worried about the US "absolutely positively" having to kick
someone's ass?  What else would you do...economic sanctions?  Talk sternly
to them? No way.  Violence is what people like these understand and
respect...nothing else.
