When my necro was 28, I solod on the western side of the lake in lake of ill
omen.. near where the pillars are.
You can pull to the beach and you wont get adds. You dont need sow cos you
dont have to run that far to pull.
Everything will be low dark blue for you. You should be able to pull several
in succession before you need a med up.

Another place that might be interesting is the crazed goblins in
butcherblock.
Also, it used to realy suck from overcamping, but these days paw in SK
usually has plenty to pull.

You might want to wait till you hit 29, and you have a new pet and a decent
snare, till you try these last 2 options. Both are pretty good loot-wise,
for their level.
