Your point, as I saw it, was people can't reasonably be expected to 
strain their RL friendships in the slightest in favour of random people 
out in the internet... my point is that if randoms out on the internet 
would like to see more equity then the first step is to come out from 
behind their anonymous mask and become a person.

People are a lot more likely and many *will* strain an RL relationship 
for another RL relationship, even a long distance one, especially when 
then LD person is in the right.

I know I would... but for Roxy the woodelf... well I might even for 
her/him(??) but the odds are a lot less.
