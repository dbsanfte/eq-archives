Can you tell me where the Coldain Velium equipment can be obtained? (not
from purchasing from players as I am a Druid and don't have that kind of
money)
What level is needed to safely get to where it is?  I know the name starts
with a T or something, but can you tell me a little more specifically where?
What zone is it? This way I can get maps, etc., from the atlas.. thanks!
