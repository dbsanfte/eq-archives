It's about the same as it ever was.  They did add a "roleplay preferred"
server, Firiona Vie, that has a modified ruleset (very very few nodrop
items, one character per account, no "common" language).

That depends on that character and your definition of "do something".

The new PoP expansion has GREATLY reduced travel time, removing one of the
major time sinks from the game.  You can generally get just about anywhere
within a few minutes, so you spend less time travelling and more time
playing.

Not necessarily.  The addition of the Bazaar has changed things.  The Bazaar
allows people to put their characters in "merchant mode" and sell off excess
gear.  You can find all sorts of stuff there.

> How is camping and looting and all that ??

Camping is better than it used to be.  The items in the newer expansions are
better, so nobody camps the older ones anymore, which doesn't matter much
because the older zones are usually empty anyway.  And for the most part,
they've gotten away from the "specific item drops off specific mob at
specific location" model, so item camping isn't nearly as prevalent.

> Is the penalty for death still as bad ??

At level 10 or below, there is no penalty anymore.  You even keep your stuff
when you respawn at your bind point.

They also revamped the cleric "resurrection" line, offering more spells that
give better resurrection percentages starting at a lower level.  So you can
usually find someone close by to help you get at least SOME experience back.

And the newer zones make it easier to regain the experience that you lost.
