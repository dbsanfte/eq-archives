It's just a toggle - you can remove someone in the same way you added
them. Type '/friend' to get a list of your current friends. Pick one you
no longer need, let's say you have a friend called jimbob - type
'/friend jimbob' to remove him from your friends list (if you didn't
have a friend called jimbob you would have just added him as a friend
instead).

Same deal for your ignore list.
