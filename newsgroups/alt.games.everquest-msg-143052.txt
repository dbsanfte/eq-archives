Hi,

I started a Gnome Necro (yeah, I know it's weird -- a
"good" race with an "evil" profession).

Anyway, I just hit 20 and noticed that one of my spells
is only available in Ogguk in the SK guild.  I noticed
that I was KoS to the Bouncer's, but I figured that I
*must* be able to uninvis in the SK guild since that's the
only place I can get the spell and the SK's are "like
family" for Necros.

Well, as you have probably guessed by now, I uninvised
and immediately got gangbanged by one of the Greenbloods
in the room (SK) for 1011 damage.  Needless to say, 1011
damage is about a bazillion more HP than a level 20 necro
has and I promptly died and am now about 2 blue pixels
from undinging :^(

My question is:  How the hell is a person supposed to get
a spell from a town like this (it's not available elsewhere
according to CR -- maybe Paineel, but I'm KoS to the guards
there as well so probably same situation)?  What was Verant
thinking when they made a spell that's unobtainable like
this?  At my level, 15pp is a lot to risk giving some random
newbie to "please buy my spell for me" (I don't think I have
enough for all my spells anyway)  I don't have a second
account and machine to create an alt to buy it for me, and
even if I did, that would completely kill any aspect of the
roleplaying by cheating like that.

Thanks,
Mike
