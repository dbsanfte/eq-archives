Being guild leader.  Nuff said, but I'll say more. :p  My guild is doing
more raids for those capable and willing to go, but only on weekends,
usually one Raid-type zone a week (Hate, Fear, that type of stuff).  The
vast majority of my time online is doing shit for guildmates (and I DO
delegate more than any GL I know...but it's still a hell of a lot of time
wasted).  Raids being maybe one a week is a very small percentage of my
time.  We've been hunting Kael a little recently, and went to DN and SG the
other day, but that was single party stuff.

I'm going to work on getting to 58 very soon though...doing less for the
guild in the process.  It's just time, ya know?  I think I've been 57 long
enough. :)
