Be careful with your terms.  Skills are things like "1-handed blunt"
or "dodge" or "brewing".  Strength is a stat, or an attribute, or
some such term.

Anyway, yes, items that give +str will add as you described.  That's
how characters eventually end up with really enormous stat numbers.

Items that add a percentage to a skill usually do NOT combine.
E.g., if you have two items that each give +5% to brewing, you
won't get +10%.  (If the items are different, you'll get the
larger of the two increases.)  Similarly, items that give "Haste"
(faster attacks) don't combine, though they WILL combine with
spells and other ways to increase attack speed.
