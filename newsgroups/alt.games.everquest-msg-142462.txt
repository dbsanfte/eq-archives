No, what I said is at the high end theres a LOT more classes that make a
raid happen than Warriors and clerics.

James, Ben, would your guild even think about attempting Emp if you knew
you'd have no mages on that day?

I can think of a lot of raids that wouldn't happen without a mage.

How about AL if your druids and shamans werent online? (assuming they got
the copies of GRC over clerics, to make them feel more needed on raids)

A lower level guild just able to do Kland.. got a bard?  if not, you aint
slowing him and you aint winning.  no bard, no raid.

Got a shaman for RC and statue?  Oh dear, may as well forget the raid.

And "coming up with one example hardly negates the proposition"? Its the
highest level raid zone in fucking velious!

You can add Sleepers tomb to the list too, as another example where a
warrior isnt *CRUCIAL*

We've pulled King Tormax with 18 people/a monk tank.  Lack of warriros
didn't make that raid end.

The fact some raids are cancelled because of a warrior shortage doesn't
really mean much, when most classes can cause a raid to be cancelled.

So, sorry.. what was your point again?
