There seem to be some oddities in the language-learning code.  I did
some sessions a few months back to max out my Tainted Heartstone, with
mixed results.

Session 1: Group of 5 (or maybe 6), we were camping something boring so
I started spamming languages during the downtime. I had 1 point in each
(trainable) language to start. Spamming raised my skill, also raised the
listeners skill.

Session 2: I was missing some of the untrainable (to my main) languages so
I hydraed up some characters who can learn them. Grouped up (group of
two), started spamming... and hit the "train other person to one greater
than your current skill" limit. It was too annoying to switch back and
forth spamming, so I exited the zone with one character, continued to
spam, and started getting constant skillups on the spammer, and none on
the listener (in another zone). Very odd.

Anyway, my preferred method for teaching/learning, assuming you are in a
group setup not limited to the "one by one" method:
I use a programmable gamepad, so I assign one button to macro
"shift-uparrow; enter, repeat". Select a language, say something in /g,
then hit the macro button. The skillups roll in, and I estimate you can
max all the languages in less than half an hour. For some reason this
seems to be faster than using a hot button to say five lines at a time,
and using the macro to hit that button again and again. Possibly some
kind of interface lag, who knows. YMMV. 

ObWoot: Finally got my VT key on the weekend, and was lucky to see both
my Ancient spells drop, completing my Luclin set (and they're actually
quite usable too). Unfortunately the number of people doing LDoN has
dropped to zero so I'm unlikely to get all my spells from there now. I
have better gear, I just want the spells. Can I help it if I'm a
completist?
