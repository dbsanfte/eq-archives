Parsing misses,

* all dots that aren't yours
* any non-melee dmg for which you're not in range (if you're standing on
the mob, you'll miss stuff from casters / rangers etc. who are far away, if
you're a caster / ranger who's far away you'll miss stuff for anyone closer
and weapon procs, etc.)
* pet procs (innate / weapon based) unless you've configured your parser to
see them and understand them (pet procs give an effect 'your target goes
blurgh' but don't list any damage).
* damage shields

at least.  There may be more.
