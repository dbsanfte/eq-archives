I don't know, which spell line can affect 50 mobs at a time?  I thought
it was mez, or maybe mez till nukes start and stun after...  but I really
don't know

The group type I am thinking of would be killing 30 to 50 mobs at a time, not
10.  Heck, I've done 12 at a time just me and a druid

AFAIK you need point blank (ie centered on self) AOE spells to affect
massive numbers of mobs, we aren't quadding here.  If there are targetable
spells that will hit 50 close packed mobs, fine

Pet not important but if mage can do the nuke job that will
make finding party easier.
