/agree!

I wish they would lock the Zorros into a certain radius of
spawn point.  I've seen them back at the rear gobbie camps
kicking the crap outta everything.

The seem to aggro and run out a bit, then aggro on another
mob and run out more, and so on and before long, they are
deep in the zone from "chaining" mob-to-mob.  It's pretty
irritating actually.

Perhaps if they could only aggro freshly on mobs within
so many "feet" of their posts, that would help.  Then, if
KoS players run through, the zorros can pursue, but they
would not aggro on "normal" mobs outside of their defined
"post".

Oh well - it's not a huge deal since you only spend 10 or
so levels in Misty, but it is extremely irritating to be
a newb and have the mob down to 1 HP, have used all of your
mana, and taken a beating only to have a zorro KS you!
