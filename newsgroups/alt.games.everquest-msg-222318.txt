"Do what though wilt shall be the whole of the law". Moral code from within
ourselves is by no means a new concept. It is one that has been actively
discussed for quite some time now :) Incidently I tend to trust those who do
have a strong inner moral code far more than those who have an imposed
outside one . The later tend to become lawyers on what they can and can not
do, law being more important than ethics to them.

Since I dont trust ya , and since I enjoy adding fuel to an OT
political/moral post have another quote. "When you understand why you have
rejected all the other possible gods you will have some idea why I do not
believe in yours. I merely believe in one less god than you do "
