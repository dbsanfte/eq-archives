I usualy phrase it "May I donate to your order?"  After all, clerics do have
a minstry to run when they're not out helping to kill dragons.  That whole
vow of poverty thing.

Never had to figure out how to do this with a druid's ports, since I don't
pay for SoW or ports.... OTOH, I don't ask for them either; walking's just
fine for me.
