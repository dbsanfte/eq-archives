I suggest you buy PoP now, you'll be required to have it when you go on 
raids eventually, Plane of Knowledge has port stones to all starting 
cities and merchants and banks making it an ideal place to use the 
soulbinder so you can get almost anywhere fast if you die.  PoP has 
added levels too.  Most people have Luclin too.  If you wait just a few 
more weeks to buy, you can probably get all the expansions you are 
missing for one low price, check out the station.com store for more 
info, not sure of name or price on that.

I think at mid 30s you can get in groups in Dawnshroud on Luclin or 
Overthere or Dreadlands on Kunark (not sure about lowest level in DL). 
You really need the expansions to get good xp.  And don't let anyone 
tell you that you get less xp with a full group, they added a full group 
bonus recently.

Good luck
