It wouldn't even have to be elaborate.  Just have it so the quest ends with a
turn in to one NPC that spawns another NPC for a short time that you then have
to do another turn in to in order to finish the quest.  Make it so that things
that raise faction with one of these lower faction with the other, so that if
you go to far raising for one, you won't be able to talk to the other.
