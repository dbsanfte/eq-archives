Lucy says its slot 2 and increase damage shield by 5.  I'm pretty sure I 
was getting 15, but of course now thats in doubt too, as I expected to 
get that and wasn't making a point of taking it on and off to check the 
math.

If its 5 I'll never use it for DS purposes.

However, it is still handy to have an illusion to change my size that 
doesn't conflict with Clarity line; there have been times when I've had 
to click off C6 in order to use Pact to get big enough to climb over a 
ledge, skellie form being bigger than gnome.  Now I'll only be clicking 
off something I can replace myself.
