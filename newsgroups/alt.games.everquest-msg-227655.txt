A) you top posted, meaning you don't pay any attention to how things are 
done around here, so its hard to take what you say seriously

B) as I said, its a done deal, unless something actually goes wrong and 
is demonstrably the fault of the seller, I got a substantial discount 
for taking a floor model in "as is" condition (as if I cared about the 
scuffed paint job)

C) For a comperable dell machine I'd have had to shell out about twice 
as much cash, or contrawise, could only have afforded a machine which 
looked substantially inferior, at least on the specs.  Whats so much 
better about a Dell compared to a Compaq?  Is it a big enough difference 
that I should have been happy taking the machine running at 1.9 GHz with 
a CD rom and CD writer instead of 2.66 with DVD/CD rom and DVD/CD writer?

I also have the vague idea that for EQ purposes, a GeForce is a "good 
thing" and none of the other machines I looked at in my three hours time 
alloted for running around and picking one had one other than this 
particular compaq.

Splendid
