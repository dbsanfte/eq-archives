I meant that they took a lot out of us for what they give back (hit kinda
hard, exp was kinda crap, loot was horrid)  thus a LOT of med time.

Actually, I only died because some named giant saw through my camo while I
was waiting outside the fort for the bard to get a res.

He had never been to CC before, so didn't know what he was doing there,
other than that he's actually a good bard.

That's insane (to pay that much, not to hunt it)

Faction, they've gotten me up to indifferent with Coldain already.

Did tizmaks already, I'm dubious, and I'd kinda rather not have another KoS
race on my list, got the mace too, and all the tizmak armour I'd want to
wear (Cured surcoat and legs, looks really nice on female wood elves, with
ulthork arms and bracer) =P

And the thing is, I'm kind of a strange druid, I like dungeons, and I hate
soloing, and except for SoW and ports, I would've been a cleric.
