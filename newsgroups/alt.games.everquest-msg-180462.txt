The place to look is 
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/manual/manual.jsp?chapter=30 for chat 
commands.

Basically, use /join to join a channel or /autojoin to set the list of 
channels to be joined at login.  Examples:

/join channel
/join channel:password
/join channel:password,anotherchannel:anotherpassword
/autojoin channel:password,anotherchannel:anotherpassword...

Use /list to find out what channels you're in and what numbers have been 
assigned to them.

/1 message
    or
;1 message
will send a message to channel 1.

I find /announce on useful, it tells you when someone enters or leaves 
the channel.

The /autojoin command applies to all your characters, so if you have 
some characters you don't want known to people others chat with, don't 
use /autojoin.
