I think you've hit the real problem here.  My main is a druid. I solo.  I like 
soloing.  Not withstanding all that I've been in guilds and I rather enjoy talking 
to friends who are on while I solo and I'm happy to lend a hand if you need a gate, 
stop and rescue someone or group of someones who have gotten in over their head, SoW 
you for a CR or ,as happened once, rescue a guildie who fell off the boat in the 
middle of the ocean and "will someone please come and get me?".  So what happens, 
first the previously mentioned attempted nerfs on experience, and yes I was one of 
the people who let SOE know that I was happy about it. They increased the exp with 
grouping, okay no biggie with me.  Now there is an entire upgrade where the only way 
you can get new spells and new equipment is by dungeon crawling in a group.  It's 
the return of the "vision"

"Sigh" I've had friends ask me to go into LDoN's with them and I have turned them 
down because frankly my grouping skills are non-existant.  And I don't want to 
improve them.  Dungeon crawling has never appealed that much to me and the whole 
"cog in a well-oiled machine" approach needed for a raid strikes me as an awful way 
to spend play time.   

The funny thing is that my first character in EQ was a palading back when the game 
had just gotten out of beta.  I wanted to be a wandering solitary knight, helping 
people and then riding off into the sunset (pardon the genre mixing here).  Those of 
you who played pallys back in those day's know how successful I was at that.  I quit 
after 8 months and then started playing again when Kunark came out.  And the funny 
thing is my druid makes a much better wandering knight then my pally ever did.  But 
I guess wandering solitary knights of any type are just not part of the 
hallucination ...er I mean vision.
