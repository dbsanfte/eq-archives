What melee weapons are you using?
You should use "Snare" to slow your mobs.  If you "root" them they will fight
to their deaths.  If you "snare" them they will stop fighting when they get
close to death.
On archery:  I am level 52.  I use a compound steelshaft bow 28/40 9 damage
bonus, poison 3.  I am using silvertip/steel/para/small arrows 6/150, magic. 
My archery skill is master level.  I keep "falcon eye" cast on myself. 
I am going to *guess* that my average hit is for around 20.  I get a few crits
around 80, lots of hits around 30, lots of misses too.  
Real damage output with a bow doesn't come til really high levels, I'm told.
