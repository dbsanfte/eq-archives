Looting bug? Are you referring to the looting -LAG-? Yes, that was
around in the first couple days, but that's because morons believed
some web site saying certain servers were the best to play on and,
thus, certain servers were being choked to -WAY- above their intended
capacity. They've doubled the number of servers last I heard, and
people have spread out which has helped a WHOLE lot with lag.

Also, getting 200k accounts on the -FIRST DAY- was something they
never expected. NO game has had an opening day that big before.
