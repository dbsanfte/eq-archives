Zone with guards that kill the mobs:  North Karana -- Not your fast 
experience zone, but the guards at the tower and at the stone bridge will 
kill just about any intruder.  These could include the Hill Giants and the 
Griffon family.  The guards at the tower are of somewhat low level, the ones 
at the stone bridge are a bit higher.
