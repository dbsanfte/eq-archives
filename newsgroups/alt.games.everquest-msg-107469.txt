oooo must have gotten under your skin with that one :p I already said I dont
really care how my guild does it and since they assign loot by officer whim
and im still there years later it would seem I mean what I said.

What I wonder at is that people think they can be more fair then random
chance. The man more fair than the machine. Reminds me of a group in florida
counting ballots. Every time they counted them they seemed to find more .
The underlying basis of said count was the machine cant count nearly as well
as these 1500 people which is particularly asinine. I dont think they can be
more fair, what they can be is more powerfull and man craves power like
nothing else.
