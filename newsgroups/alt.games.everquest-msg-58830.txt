AHAh yeah that is even worse when  high level class like an enchanter
does not do the OBVIOUS things like mezzing. Its like "HELLO, WHY DO
YOU THINK YOU ARE IN OUR GROUP?"

I guess if a chanter gets in your group and does not immediately haste
the tanks and clarity the casters, that they should get the boot. Not
knowing to do that or to mez is pretty goofy.

Even my level 14 shaman on the FV server, first thing when joining a
group outside it sows everyone every so often (because its huge mana
then) until everyone in the group is sow'd. Then during luls where its
about FM again, it starts the cycle anew before they run out so NO ONE
is ever without sow or ever has to ask.
