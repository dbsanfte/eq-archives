Well, and there's the rub.  XP is a very class-dependent thing.  Monks and
other soloists can get better XP in other zones, where the mobs don't have
insane hit points.

For me, a cleric, I depend on a group.  I cannot get good XP on my own - I
don't have the equipment for it, like say a manastone.  And, in all the
groups in all the zones I've been on, if you can get a high dps group going
in CT, the XP will flow like water.

The only time I've seen better is a late-night AE group in Seb.  We had the
whole zone to ourselves and managed 50 kills per pull.  I was 59 at the
time; it was weird watching my XP bar *visibly* move.  =)
