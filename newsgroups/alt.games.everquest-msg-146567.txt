I have a 52 druid, and something you should be aware of (that I have also
been on the other end of), is that one of your kited mobs WILL attack
others.  I, and I don't expect others too either, will NOT just let
something beat on me until it's kiter comes back to get it.  So if you lose
a mob (either because it attacked someone, or you ran too far away from it
and other can't tell you are kiting it), just grab another.  I certainly
don't expect someone to die in the hopes I will come back and get a lost mob
before it beats them to death.....
