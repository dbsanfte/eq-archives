I am a newbie and starting off with several characters to try out. So I 
will post about each class here asking for ideas about best race to play 
for a given class, or at least the pros and cons of the available 
choices... Right now I am on Stromm but posted here for feedback on the 
new server.

How significant is the XP leveling boost for a Halfling? Does it really 
make much difference? That's kind of appealing if it actually matters. I 
was trying to decide between a Wood Elf, which I thought had great stats 
for a Druid and a Halfling. In the end I went with the Halfling. Does it 
matter much?

I've also read that Misty Thicket starting area for Halflings is a cool 
place and that factored in some too.
