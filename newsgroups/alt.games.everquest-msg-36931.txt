For you stan... Im bottom posting... this message only.. grin
BBS days... Apple ][e days we are talking about....   The Internet was
not around for the General public... (im not some Guru who can quote
dates etc)...  Sure the military had their network (ARPANET?) and the
Big universitys.....   

BBS days when 300 baud was KICKING A--  and every little phreak out
there had to put  a K in front of everything.
K-rad
K-cool
K-etc

Enjoy your day..
