Here's my suggestions for Luclin, maybe Verant actually reads them :)

- Make the game "minimizable". Extremely handy when meditating.... you could
make the taskbaricon flash as soon as a character is being attacked. I am
one of those lucky ones with 2 comps, so while I med, i'm browsing the web
on my laptop, do e-mail etc... making the game minimizable would be easy.

- Make the chat windows in IRC style. In other words, you can setup a
different guild window, a different group window, and different windows for
tells with several persons. These windows should me made minimizable in the
game. Almost everyone will mess up by saying things to guild instead of
group, giving tells to wrong persons, etc etc.... i see it all te time.
Furthermore typing /guild /g and /tell person in front of every sentence
gets annoying....chat system could be improved.


Anyone else?

Maarten
