In my experience, Root is the better choice if you want to do anything
damaging to the mob while it's rooted (melee, archery, nukes). Instill
works better if you just want to leave the mob in place (CC, dots, debuffs).
Instill seems to break way easier if you do any direct damage to the mob,
but if you don't, it will almost always last the full duration.
