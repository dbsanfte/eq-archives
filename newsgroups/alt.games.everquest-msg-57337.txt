I received a Crystal Covered Shroud as a gift! This would be excellent for
my level 8 human monk in Freeport.

The only problem is that my level 1 Iksar is the one that actually got the
shroud. Doh!

How do I get the shroud to my monk safely? Iksars are not popular anywhere
else and humans are not popular in Cabilis.

Any suggestions on a safe travel route?
