    I am a cleric of 37.  I have just recently learned that if a Warrior
goes below 2 life bubbles, they go into what is called Bezerk.  Now I think
you wouldnt want to do this at lower levels because tanks have less HP to
play (hate to use that word, it sounds as if Im toying around with the tank)
with.
    So, what is your stance on this practice as another cleric or a tank.
I was intrigued by it... and only have done it a few times.....
Tanks: does it scare the crap outa you and you dont like the healer to do
this?
Cleric:  Do you find the groups you join mind/dont mind this practice?

your input is greatly appreciated, and if you have anyother tips, Id be
happy to hear em.
