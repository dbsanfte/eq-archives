No market for Padding since the Smithing trivials were dropped... Fine Plate
now trivials at about 180-185 (about the level Banded used to trivial at)
instead of 242, meaning there are a lot less combines using Padding needed
for skill-up reasons... and since nobody has bought FP to wear in a LOOOONG
time, hardly anyone needs 200 stacks anymore. :o)

Yes... it used to take 200 stacks to trivial Fine Plate... 4000 combines,
with a skill-up avg of 1 per 40-60 combines to raise a skill with (at the
time) no real benefit at the end of it. If you find a Smith with a skill
over 230, give him/her a hug... they NEED to feel some love after that. :o)
