Sure it will, It will tell me the name of those really cool green or
black trousers with the chain pattern so I can go to allakhazam's and
shop.  Sometimes eq shopping isn't about stats, but about wedding attire
or formal wear.  One of these days, I will have something nice for my
arms, praps some white arms to go with my Orc chestplate and BA
trousers.  Or it will give me a name for that whip so that I can go
looking to upgrade.  Some people don't min/max their gear.  My ranger
hates walking around with an axe or his claw and moron sword.  But I
can't be at all effective with the whips I have.  When I upgrade my
whips, I will go back to using them.
