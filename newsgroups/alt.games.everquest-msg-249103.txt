	Holy Ad Hominem, Batman!

	I had actually hoped for something like online D&D crossed
with (yes) quake.  But the graphics were primitive, the combat
system more so (Just click the monster you want and hit A!  Now
wait for Loading...), there was precious little roleplaying, and
too much time spent doing nothing.  Whatever else it was it wasn't fun
(for me) so I left.

	The game I found last year was much more entertaining.  To me.
My poisonous presence doesn't stop you from running everywhere, does it? :-)
Knock yourself out. Me, I'll use POK so I can spend less time doing nothing.

>The role of PoK in the context of EQ was world-damaging

	Can you explain this once again?  My current understanding is that
it seems to have channeled people into easy to reach zones; is that the
only damage it did?
