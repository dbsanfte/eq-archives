You didn't mention of those wars when you replied to him. You have only
mentioned them once the link between Loyola and Catholicism was pointed out.
If you had I would never have posted anything.

What I said was that because he had mentioned Loyola, it would most likely

disappeared preacher, Aimee McPherson?"
