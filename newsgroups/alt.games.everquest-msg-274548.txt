You mean gnoll don't you?  As far as I know, the only place to get the Gnoll 
Mastery book is by examining the chest in Gnollslayers Keep, next to the 
Steppes gryphon station.  I, like you, also noticed that gnoll parts seem to 
drop frequently on IoR.  Just save them all and get the book as soon as you 
head to into Antonica.  Not sure where it is in Freeport/The Commonlands.
