If the food is proscribed by Mosaic Law, then yes,
it is inferred, (are rabbits and frog legs
forbidden by the Torah?)

There is a strong proscription against
homosexuality, however, and this is why the
fundamentalists wheel out Matthew 5:17-19 every
time they wish to prove that Jesus hates queers.

Christian priests didn't have a problem blessing
the artillery pieces before the Battle of the
Somme, though whether this is in line with
Christ's teachings, is open to some speculation.
