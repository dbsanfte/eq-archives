This is why it is better to park your pet in a safe spot you want to pull to
with /pet guard here
Then go pull mob with spell or aggro try to stay out of melee range. Pull
mob to pet.
As you run over pet do /pet attack with your pull still targeted.
If you let the mob hit you your pet will come to your aid and you may not be
fighting where you want to be.
Stand opposite your pet so it attacks from behind and you get defence
increases. If you get near half life back away.
