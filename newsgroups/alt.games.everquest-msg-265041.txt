Not just the city quest.  I noticed my journal wasn't consistently updating 
too.  But I also reached the end of my Qeynos citizenship quest, but it can 
not be completed.   I still have the original welcome to Qeynos book, but 
can't read it anymore.

They appear to have broken quite a few things with this patch.  Since it is 
my first patch since I got in to beta I don't know how typical or atypical 
today's result is.  But it makes me a bit nervous about release.
