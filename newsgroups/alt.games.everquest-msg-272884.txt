Texas used to have a law, 'they needed killing' as a reason to not
be found guilty back in the 1800s. It lasted up until about 1950.

I said someone needed to be tossed into jail if all he did was make
a valid complaint. It doesn't follow they broke a law nor does it
imply I think they broke a law. Get out of the rut you and the rest
have placed yourselves into.

For many long years, and probably still in some small towns, there
doesn't need to be a law to jail someone, the local cops have more
than once arrested someone and put them in jail for no other reason
than 'cause the cop said so'. If you have never heard of such things
happening, you have led a very sheltered life.

Wrong.
