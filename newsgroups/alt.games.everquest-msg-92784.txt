Server class is a generic term which generally indicates computers 
designed to be installed in a data center and run 24/7.  They generally 
have capabilities for much more memory, multiple processors, multiple disk 
controllers, redundant power supplies, extensive OOB management 
(independant of OS), and hot-swap capabilities of bascially any componant.  
The very fact that you seem unaware of this indicates you really don't 
know what you're talking about.

Are you talking the point-to-point T3 telco circuit, or the IP feed that 
runs across it?  You do realize that the retail cost for the IP feed runs 
from $30k-$45k/month, right?  You also realize that Verant requires 
multiple OC-12s at least, for the bandwidth they use.  An OC-12 is 12 T3s 
(2.4gig/sec), and several of us have run the numbers and come up with 
bandwith requirements of about 3Gigbit/sec at peak times.
Even with HUGE discounts, I fully suspect that Verant pays in the range of 
$250k/month for bandwidth.

Actually, we have a very good idea how many servers they require, since 
several tech rags published articles detailing the setup.  Each server 
(the rathe, nameless, etc) requires about 25 physical computers.  There 
are 40some servers, so we know there are about 1000 physical servers, and 
yes, $15-20k is a realistic price for corporate class servers.
Call up your HP or Compaq rep today, and ask them to price out some 
servers for a 24/7 industrial application.  Explain that you need the 
fully managed server line.  Post your price quotes.  

> Also, no server is 15 - 20 thousand dollars no a days.

Yes it is.  Here's a link for the top of the line Dell server, with a 
minimal config:
http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.asp?customer_id=555&order_code=PE8450(W2K,LX,NoOS)&s=biz&cfgpg=1

Notice the price is over $24k.  Notice the monthly lease is over $650.  

How about a slightly smaller server:

http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.asp?customer_id=555&order_code=PE7150(MSWin,LX)&s=biz

Hell, this one is only $22k, or $600/month.

These are for servers with the minimum disk, the minimum memory, no 
add-ons at all, no display, nothing.  Buy and support a couple hundred 
of these and tell me how cheap they are.

Why in the fuck would they need a couple hundred routers?  I've purchased 
over 200 Ciscos in a year, you may end up with a 35% discount over list.  
Really.  Hell, I was working for a company that bought that many 7500 and 
12000 series routers and got a 40% discount.  Verant needs a couple 12000s 
and about a dozen 6500 series switches.  Not exactly a huge customer.  
Enough to get 35% discount though.  So instead of each switch being $100k, 
it's only $65k.  Still not cheap.  Routers are in the several hundred 
thousand range each most likely, even if they use Juniper.

Umm, I can name a dozen CS people for Qwest who make significantly more 
than that.  They didn't start at that range, but significantly more than 
$25k.  I can name people at IDT (cheap ass telco) who make significantly 
more than that working in CS.  
Of course you won't get $25k because you're an illiterate idiot, but many 
people do.

Excuse me?  How are you going to do this?  Yes, it is possible to invest 
that money and make more, but it's also very, very possible to have your 
investments lose value.  I think you're trying to grasp the concept of the 
opportunity cost.  Having $100 now is a good thing, because you can use it 
for many things, paying your rent with it limits you, so if you can avoid 
paying your rent for 2 weeks, you have more use of the money.  But if 
you're an idiot and lose it at the dogtrack (or invest it in Enron stock 
as part of a complex long-term power purchase), you still owe rent and now 
you don't have the money.  No free lunches and all.

I've never claimed to be a programmer.  I'm a network guy.  I'm interested 
in the big picture.  Programming is like any other field with unlimited 
wants and only limited resources.  You set up a triage system,and work on 
biggest bang-for-the-buck fixes.  A minor display bug that affects 50% of 
the user base is often a higher priority than a crash-to-desktop bug that 
affects 2% of the userbase.  Sucks if you're the 2%, but that's life.

I don't know.  If the corrupt icons are a result of a virus running loose 
and happily spreading itself from Outlook client to Outlook client you 
should probably worry about the icons first.

I'm not a programmer.  Never claimed to be.  I've had programmers work for 
me.  I have taken part in the software development and the QA cycle, but 
I'm not a programmer.  I'm actually taking part in a new product roll-out 
this very weekend, with poorly coded applications, and not enough time to 
fix everything, and absolutely non-existant documentation.  I know about 
bad programming, and I get paid to prioritize the issues and get the thing 
working NOW, and fix it later.

What bardsong issues?  I'm a bard, I follow the bard boards religiously, I 
post there fairly often.  The Katta's Sword Dancing issue isn't a bardsong 
issue, it's a proc issue.  It affects bardsongs, but VI and the bardic 
communtiy seem pretty convinced that it's procs causing problems with 
bardsongs, NOT bardsongs being broken.  
As for the LD issue, when I start seeing packetloss I begin investigating 
on another computer.  Hmmm, I find problems with the peering at backbone 
ISPs, I don't see a problem with VI.  I don't see any BGP flaps from VI.  
I don't see any packetloss or routing instability from VI.  I connect to 
my backup ISDN providers and pinpoint the problem.  Except in the few 
instances where EVERYONE goes LD at once, it's almost always a peering or 
routing issue well removed from Verant.  The cable companies are failing 
left and right, scrambling to get new ISPs to float them, unable to keep 
their customers connected, but the LD is Verant's problem.  Sorry, this is 
a best-effort network, and sometimes shit happens.  It certainly doesn't 
mean it's Verant's fault.
As to the ATI issue, it's a known issue, Verant is working on it.  They 
will probably eventually fix it.  You are affected by it.  You have 
several reasonable choices:  stop playing, buy an nVidia card, shut up and 
suffer.  Coming to usenet, wagging your dick, acting like an ignoramous is 
not a reasonable choice.
