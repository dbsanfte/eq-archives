I just saw the pictures of the new ranger epic on the website. Those are
some really sexy swords, though not really all that much of a change from
the current ones visually.  Sort of a cross between original epics and
nightgrowth blade.

Anyhow, does anyone know if the original information about the bow was
incorrect, or if in fact SOE changed their minds when Rangers complained
that their epic was a weapon (bow) that SOE had pointblank said wasn't
intended to be their primary form of DPS?
