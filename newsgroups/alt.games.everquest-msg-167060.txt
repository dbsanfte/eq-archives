L52ish SK spell.
It used to be (iirc) a mana tap proc spell (and therefore only worked on
caster mobs). So nobody used it, *ever*.
SoE retuned it in the previous patch onto a 100DD proc which gave back 100
mana as well, no matter if the mob had mana to drain or not.
And it also stacked with Soul Abrasion AA (extra damage on SK spell procs)
so could to 300DD and give back 100mana per proc.

Now it's down to 50DD and 50-100 mana back (scaling with level to 60).

And now you know =)
