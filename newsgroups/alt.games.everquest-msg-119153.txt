My apologies, I meant to say "dumpy looking."  I left out a kind of
important word.  I doubt if I was touting the excellence of OE...it's not
THAT good, though it does do a couple things that Agent doesn't (I forget
what) that I've come to rely on.  I probably also said that the makers of
Agent have no intention of updating the product at all (Agent fans argued
that it's perfect as it is, as long as you give it enough rules) and that
support for Agent isn't nearly as prevalent as support for OE...and that OE
doesn't REQUIRE support as much as Agent does.

Agent is to newsreaders as Linux is to operating systems...both are superior
to anything Microsoft puts out but require geeks to use them beyond their
basics.

I will gleefully admit that Agent is the better reader if you have the
patience to make it work well.  I don't.
