The "only" people?  How about the buff and heal beggars and the people
who would "accidentally" train lots of undead or orcs to the tunnel
and start frantically typing "/y" and "HELP PLZ"? (And then get pissed
when you kill the mobs instead of healing or damage shielding them)

Admittedly, I don't miss the "make an offer" deals and the newbies
asking 75pp for a high quality bear skin, not to mention the fact that
sometimes it took several days or weeks to find what you were looking
for.
