I took my Ogre Warrior straight from his N00b zone to Paludal, and worked
him up to level 27 there.  You're right, when you're in a good group,
thrashing bandits left and right, and watching that yellow bar climb, it's
just not worth it to hold on to those weapons.  They aren't worth much,
weigh quite a bit, and don't stack.

That being said, I always pulled them off the corpese and dropped them on
the ground.  They're quite visible there, and anyone that needs a few GP (or
plat if you want to put in some time) can easily pick up a full load, go
sell them, and have another full load waiting on the ground when they get
back.  This way, the corpses can decay as well, so you're not always bending
over to loot some worthless corpse by misclicking, or getting a looted one
mixed up with an unlooted one.

While I always put in some effort to keep the corpses cleaned up, Paludal is
one of those places that is just flat out fantastic for XP if you're the
right level.  Getting a good group by the bandit camp zone in from SH isn't
that hard during peak hours, and you can grind out level after level there,
with virtually no downtime.  Sometimes people that are after good xp get
busy in a  place like this and just ignore the corpses.  Twinks especially
don't CARE about the loot, they just want the XP, and stopping to loot means
slowing down a good group when it's really swinging.
