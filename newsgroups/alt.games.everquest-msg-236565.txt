What you're looking for is the "Pet Discipline" AA (more commonly known as
"Pet Hold").  However, you have to be at least level 59 and spend 24AA
getting that ability (6AA on general abilities, 12AA on archtype abilities,
then 6AA on pet hold). Until then, spamming the "Back Off" button on your
pet window until you get to your pet should do the trick.
