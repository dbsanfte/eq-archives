Yep. Same thing Happened to me. There are several possible causes to the
problem (these are what it was for me).

1. Direct X 8.0a has known problems with EQ. The replacement manual even
tells you not to use 8 but instead use 7 since they have not been able to
resolve the incompatibility problems just yet. Not saying everyone with
Direct X 8 will have trouble, but some do.

2. Direct X 8.0a is incompatible with SoundBlaster Live card drivers.
Microsoft has said it, and so has Creative. Neither are working all that
hard to fix the problem.

3. A firewall. If, like me, you use a firewall (ZoneAlarm to be exact), The
newest version does not work well with EQ. Anytime you zone, or die, you get
booted and the computer crashes or locks up. Massive Audio and Video
problems are also caused. Again, it is not the same for everyone, but for
many. I have to shut mine down when I play or I get dropped every 10 Minutes
or so.

There may be other issues as well, but those are the most common that I am
aware of. I have, almost, the same exact setup you do and as soon as I
reformatted my HD and Installed Direct X 7.0a, and shut off the Firewall
while playing, the problem was solved.


Hope this helps
