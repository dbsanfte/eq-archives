I did a few tri- and quad-kites at the gnoll spires in SK, but those were
few and far in-between. (Place was always camped.)

At your level, I'd suggest Den Ironblend and her 2 friends in Butcherblock.
They're in the group of houses south of the docks. Those three spawns got me
through levels 44 to 47 in like 3 days .. They're not too hard to take down
with full mana, and you've got ten minutes in-between spawns to med up. Good
place to practice.

Note .. You will kill your KaladimCitizens faction doing this. So far, I've
only been attacked by a few (mostly females) dwarves in Butcherblock, and
one in OOT (on Sister Isle) from taking these faction hits. The guards will
not attack you if you run a pissed-off citizen past them, and I have yet to
be attacked inside Kaladim. Once you get KOS with Den&Friends, they become a
little trickier to pull. (Have to get inside their little house to get the
other two.)

You'll want to practice on stuff that's pretty green at first, get the hang
of snaring on the run with three or four mobs chasing you. One of the arts
of quad-kiting is grouping them all together in a bunch. (Your AE's won't
hit otherwies.) The best way I've found is run in a big circle with them in
the middle, until they're packed together. It takes a bit of skill, but once
you get it you never forget it. ;)
