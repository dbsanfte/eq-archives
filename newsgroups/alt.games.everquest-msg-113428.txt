My favorite beg story was when I was goofing on another server
while my normal server was down. I had a made a erudite mage and
gotten up to level 9 playing all weekend. Totally untwinked and very naked.
I was running on a CR into the warrens when a newbie was begging from
me and would not let up, I finally said "Look dude I am only level 9" he says
"DUDE I AM ONLY LEVEL 1!!!!" Then I said "Look I don't even have money
to buy my level 9 spells and you want me to give you money?" He says "yes
I don't have anything!!!" No shit really? /ignore idiot beggar.
