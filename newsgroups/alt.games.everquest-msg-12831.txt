Tboot buyer here.  If I were a stack of 10 consumer, I'd pay for them in 56
stacks, plus the money I've saved a few times already on Rez's.  As a rogue,
they're a godsend when I need to sneak through an area.

I wouldn't worry too much about not being able to sell your potions.  I have
an awful time with folks wanting to buy cookie cutters and my roguely
poisons.  If you can't sell, don't feel bad - - there are other legitimate
trades that can't sell anything, almost ever.
