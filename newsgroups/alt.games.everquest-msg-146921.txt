Except what he was talking about was whether or not I let the pop-ups
load. The topic came up when a pop-up killer program's use was
mentioned, and I stated that the pop-up killers deny the sites the
revenue from the pop-ups. If the people are continuing to go to the
site, obviously they think the content is worth the visit. Those that
run pop-up killers tend to have them up full-time, not selectively
only on the sites they think "deserve" the income...
