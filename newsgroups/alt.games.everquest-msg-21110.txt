Drachs don't drop a lot of silk.  I think probably an average of 1 silk
every 3 critters.  Certainly much less than those spiders & crags in EK.
I'm afraid that's what I do when I need more silks (actually, I usually PL
low-mid-teen guild members in EK to let them get xp while I get all the
silks).
