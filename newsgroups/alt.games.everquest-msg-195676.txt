This is one of those "Miss Manners" things.   /shrug

I was taught that proper response to "Thank you" is "You're Welcome."
Believe it or not, I actually take the time to type out "You're welcome"
everytime someone sends me a "ty".

"No problem", in my mind, assumes a kind of arrogance.  "Thank you for your
help."  "Bah, why thank me?  Such a task was not a problem for me at all.
No need for you to express any gratitude at all, I am well aware of my own
considerable abilities."

But....... it's also not worth getting worked up over.  Most people are just
substituting "no problem" for "you're welcome".  To them, they're equivalent
phrases and they don't mean "np" to be a slight at all.  So I usually accept
"np" in the spirit it was intended.
