This is my first dual-wield capable character so I don't know much
about it (as you can tell...). :) 

I was using the shield for the extra AC as I'd be taking more damage
since fights would be lasting longer than if I used my 2-hander. It
also has +magic resistance  which helped out against the casting
gnolls and orcs in Highhold Pass.  

I've got a gnoll hide lariat in the bank, actually, from time spent in
Blackburrow. I just figured I'd not pull it out until I was high
enough level for it to proc.  If that was a mistake then I'll most
definitely go grab it. If I do, which hand should I put it in?

Once 1HS is maxed I'm assuming I'd only want to break out the lariat
when I tangle with casters.  Assuming I can get the Bladed Thulian
Claws for main hand what would you prefer for off hand? The PGT we
finally snagged is nice but is a little heavy for my wood elf ranger
to be swinging around as a 2nd weapon. I might sell it to help pay for
the BTC.  Should I keep the Silvery War Axe for offhand or go for
something like the Sharkjaw Cutlass? At 10/32 it's a little slower but
hits harder. They've been getting auctioned off on the Rathe for a
decent price lately. 

Decisions decisions. :P
