LOL, I have spent the week camping the hell out of the ice giants 
in perma for the diamond dust, I need plat, it sells in bazaar 
for 10Kpp, so I hang there for 10 hours a day [since i am 
unemployed scum] and have my little camp mostly perfected...The 
Ice Giant Diplomat spawns at 25 minute intervals [8 hours game 
time] so I kill him for the plat and as a  'timer'. After he dies 
an ugly death, I run through the little back section of caves and 
out through Vox's cave passage into the King room, where I kill 
all the goblins in the king room. This nets me about 20 or so pp, 
and some drops...I give the permafrost crystals away to people 
working on pottery, adn sell the rest to vendors, though I just 
gave an archelolgists pack, the crystalline sword, the silvery 
axe, the cloak from the king, the necklace from the jailkeeperand 
the 2 handed axe to a surprised level 2 human warrior newbie 
[anybody using the issue sword and naked kicking hte crap out of 
a fire beetle and lootingit is pretty sure to be a newbie...]

About every 5 hours the ice giants spawn, one or 2 at a time 
every 15 minutes or so, starting in the room with the diplomat, 
and finishing with an ice giant magus, the priest of nagafen and 
possibly a reguular ice giant. Most of the time I am alone in 
permafrost, though people do come in now and then for other 
things, and sometimes we share the camp for giants, but most 
people are not masochistic enough to spend 10 hours and 2 
spawnings there to get a diamond dust...

Why would I need to buy plat when I can make it, hang out in game 
and do portable tradeskills, while chatting with friends. Beats 
ICQ or MSN =) I get to *kill* things==)
