Coincidence?  No.  Expected?  Definitely.

From what people have said here before:

Patch is finished.
Random number X is rolled.
Ragefire spawns X hours / days / whatever later.
Ragefire dies.
Ragefire spawns precisely 2 days (?) later.
Ragefire dies.
Ragefire spawns precisely 2 days (?) later.
...
Repeat as necessary.

Once he's been killed, he's on an exact timer, and these people *know* that
timer.  They know the previous death time, they know how long to next spawn,
so guess what?  2 minutes before spawn time, POP, they all arrive.

No ShowEQ needed, no packet sniffer needed, no cheating information
whatsoever needed.  All that's needed is an alarm clock.



"I *do* know that they are obtaining information of this type SOMEHOW..."

In summary, what you "do know" ain't so.
