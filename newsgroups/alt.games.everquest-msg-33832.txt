My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium 
with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a 15 
year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would 
womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented 
the question mark. Sometimes, he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy - the 
sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. 
My childhood was typical: summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring, 
we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag 
and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard, really.
