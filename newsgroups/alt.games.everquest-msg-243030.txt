Research is a great skill... can be kind of fun and save you a ton of
plat as you get into the higher levels.  Even at level 16 the spell
mesmerisation (area mez, which is a CRITICAL spell) can cost quite a
bit in the bazaar.  Many other spells that are "research only" can be
bought cheaply in the bazaar, but it's kind of fun to roll your own.

I don't know how much research varies according to class.  As an
enchanter I needed a "Tome of Endless Enchantments" which I believe I
bought from the gypsies in North Ro.  Check out
