14, hmmm, Well I presume you are smacking blackburrow around already. IF
not go there. I spent my 14 or so in Crushbone over on Faydwyr. Maybe the
odd pull in the courtyard of unrest if you fancy something different. A
group in Highhold might work. Top level of Runnyeye and also the Gorge of
King XXorb. My final suggestion is the area outside the mino caves in
Steamfont. All did me well...Steamfont also has a fair amount of
groundspwan that tracking a stack or two back to Kelethin may be useful.

Now as to trainers and guilds, you have one in Surefall, One in Kelethin,
one in Firiona Vie on Kunark and a trainer in Kithicor. Dont know about
Velious. So its really a basic choice as to how close you want to be that
trainer. Blackburrow is 5 minutes tops from the SUrefall trainer. The
gorge and runnyeye involve a run through MIsty, through Rivervale and to
Kithicor (about 10 mins), And anything on Fawdwyr means the Kelething
Ranger guild....about 15mins from anywhere except Crushbone which is a 5
min trip
