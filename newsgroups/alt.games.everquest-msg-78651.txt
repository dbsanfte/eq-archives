Hmmm, I'll agree on the HP, and the AC to a certain extent, but riposte, 
block, and stonestance are generally not that important when you're 
aggroing the mob from a distance and running away.  Especially when you're 
pulling mobs that can summon and you want to pull without damaging them.  
I can't think of a debuff that monks can use, they normally pull with an 
eye on summoning mobs.

I don't know, being able to feign immediately after it fails seems to be a 
pretty nifty thing.  Pullers that I know have debated if the best overall 
puller is a 60 SK with death peace, though the consensus was that necros 
with mask were pretty much unbeatable if they didn't have to get within 
melee range to pull.

believes the bigger the pull the better
