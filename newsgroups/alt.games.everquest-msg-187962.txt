Klar!

grin. Honestly, we get initiate members that have never grouped before 
and they are in their 20 levels...and they can be dangerous to a group 
if they don't do their jobs. One bright bulb didn't know what KSing was, 
or why it was a bad thing...but he got better;-)

We had a discussion one evening about the differences in players, and we 
noiced that people with a strong RPG background out of computerland 
tended to understand grouping and playing with other live people 
interacting around them much better than people who only played 
computer/video games. We noticed that the videogamers tended to treat 
everybody but themselves as NPCs [there only for their convenience] and 
were the ones who tended to walk up and demand [not ask politely for] 
buffs.
