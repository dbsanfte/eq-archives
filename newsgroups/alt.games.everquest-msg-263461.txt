Yep, i even used a different hard drive, formatted, tried it with the
standard microsoft nvidia driver and 9.0c dx, and the latest nvidia driver,
and it made no difference. And now the windows 2000 server i was using as a
backup is randomly freezing (no bsod, just locks, won't respond to numlock)
when i play games. (eg rise of nations, everquest). Sometimes i can leave my
mule all night and its fine, sometimes it's 5 minutes playtime, and it's not
a problem with heat  :P

I am suffering severe eq withdrawal :-\

Oh well, time to save for new cpu/mboard/ram. How's omens working out for
players around lv 59? Is it good xp for the non-raider or do you need uber
gear?
