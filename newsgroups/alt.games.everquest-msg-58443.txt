At 16 or so the fallen iksars in TD is not bad, there should be 8
around the island but i usually got 4 then medded up then do it again,
they hit rather hard and i never tried fearkiting for fear of bringing
one more, they stand far enough apart so that you can singel pull them
easily, loot some wizard runes, words and cash, 5gp was the max, bring
a lot of foof and water unless you can summon that.

Best thing is that you are usually alone on this island :)

Nope hunting areas are always a hot thing, my necro lvl 26 is now in
GD hunting tizmaks, tried soloing last night but that was bad, could
only find yellows that i could single pull, a blue should hopefully be
good i hope :)   teamed with a 34 druid though and that rocked, would
recomend GD before the cougars in IC that i have heard is very hard.
