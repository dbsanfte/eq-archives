Ok I cast first Drifting Death, then Drones of Doom(vambs), Immolate, and
finally Creeping Crud...they all stack!! The critters hp goes really down
fast. Its also 1440HP.
And I dont have the 1440 DoT yet so I think its great...I does use more mana
that way tho. NOTE: Immolate is not a swarm type DoT.
