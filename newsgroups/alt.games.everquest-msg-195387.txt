I did do that quest several times, but it did not involve a trip to katta.  I'm thinking of
one that had something to do with a sword and something glowing.  Actually I'm pretty sure
there were at least two, and I did both at the same time to double the effectiveness of my
travelling.

One involved some miners in Paladul... but I'm not certain that was one of the Katta ones.
Try looking up Katta on EQAtlas and looking for quests involving that city.

As an aside, the amulet you got in that amulet of the haven quest did nothing (they later
said they changed it so it would) but you got very large faction hits for doing the quest
itself with several different SH factions.  So I did it many times (very easy, only vaguely
dangerous part was run thru Echo, I later did same quest with my level 14 warrior froglok
