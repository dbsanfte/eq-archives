I've never had a race or class with forage before. My leezard apparently
has this as a native skill (which from what I've read doesn't go up
since I'm a warrior) and I totally SUCK at it.

Does where you are standing, if you are moving, type of terrain (e.g.
city, water, sand, barren ground) affect your chances of success or what
you will get? (Yes, I know, certain specific quest items can only be
foraged in some zones. I'm talking about food here.) Mostly I seem to
get the occasional water or mandrake roots for drink/food, plus a bunch
of useless non-edible crap in FoB.

Does it get any better and can I do anything to buff up my odds? If I
can forage enough to be self sufficient, I'd rather do that than pay the
extortionist NPC vendors for their crap food.
