I think a fabled quest for each of these items would have been a better
thing than have rare mobs drop them.  On some of the more mini-UBER items
have the person that you have to turn in to be an NPC in POTranquility.
That way atleast you would have to have a level 46+ toon to get the item.
It was poor planning on SOE part when they did these drops.  They should
have forseen that higher level characters would set up camps and let low
levels get in on loot list.  That high level assholes would bring a few
groups to a zone and claim rights to whole zone as their camp.

I know the concept was to have fabled items in old world zones but they
screwed it up.  Most of the people I grp with in my guild cannot wait for
the fabled and 5th anniversay stuff to go away.  It is an annoyance and a
distraction for many in the guild.  One thing it has done is shown the lack
of character of many players.  Players more willing to sit on their butts
all weekend instead of grping and enjoying the game.

Also the BB LDoN camp has been totally screwed up since this 5th aniversary
crap has been going on.  Most of the people I play with have toons on other
servers and moved to Stromm for a fresh start at life.  A pally friend who
has been with the game since day one had his 32 level pally bound at the
LDoN camp in BB.  While on a LDoN adventure in MMC he died, then endured the
hell that is a death loop.  Respawning in BB only to be beat on by red
Skeleton, die, respawn in BB and die, respawn and die.  I think he went
through this shit like 6 times.  That is Bullshit.

Like I said in my original post, it makes you wonder if the developers even
play the game.
