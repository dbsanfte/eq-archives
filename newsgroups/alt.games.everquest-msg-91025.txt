Been a good week for me...Got Incarnadine BP, Blood Runed Greaves and Lvl 55
all in one week. But now I am stumped. Other than guild groups and raids,
where is a good place for a 55 warr to go for pickup groups? I know, the Seb
/ Velks rotation, but on my server (Tunare) Seb is permacamped by 1 or 2
guilds, and Velks, as a result, is always packed. Any advice on this matter
would be appreciated.
