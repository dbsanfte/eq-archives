Hi everyone,

I was chosen to participate in the Phase2 beta of the PS2 online =
Everquest game. This is the pre-release, almost polished version.
Unfortunately, I don't think I'll have the time to play it and test it =
with all the other testers, and I really need money for school.  If =
anyone is interested in taking my place, let me know.
