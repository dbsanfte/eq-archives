Oh it is, it is.  But for three things:  (a) It's Annie.  She's a good 
enough person to be allowed blanket forgiveness for any and all minor 
transgressions of USENET netiquette, in my biased opinion.  (b) Her .sig 
is so long because it provides a valuable service to the group, and not 
just meaningless rubbish.  (c) she properly uses a .sig separator, making 
its length an even smaller deal, since a large fraction of users can 
therefore set their newsreaders to ignore it completely, if they so 
choose.
