Yep, the usual ooc I see there is

/ooc Group looking for cleric.

a while later

/ooc Group looking for any healer type.

As a shaman, I had absolutely no trouble finding a group there, definitely
was easier after I hit 29 though.

The one thing you have to watch for is that no one is over level 39 that you
group with at 26, as you will not get xp.
