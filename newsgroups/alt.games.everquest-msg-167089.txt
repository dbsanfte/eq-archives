At low level (under 20) and wearing weak armor (<= banded), I noticed
that my experimental Half Elf Warrior with maxed AGI was more likely to
have streaks of amazingly good luck defensively (i.e. somehow winning
a fight when starting out at very low health) than other characters
I've played.  As he leveled thru his twenties the apparent advantage
seemed to evaporate, probably (ok, I'm guessing) because as the fights
got longer and the mitigation of his improving armor mattered more a
couple extra misses just got lost in the noise.  I do still wonder
whether very high AGI wouldn't be useful when tanking mobs that hit
very hard.
