Did the unrest mission 2 times now:

1st was with a group of 65 to 70,70 Bst,70 Cle,65 Cle(me),65 War,67
Pal,65 Wiz.
This one was a walk in the park,Pally pulled last named with 4 adds,
we dispatched them easily,me nuking and meleeing instead of healing
all the time.
All mobs blue to 65,except the nameds which were white and the last
yellow.
Reward was a caster item for Pri/Sec/Rng slot,FT1 the usual 65 hps 
and mana,corresponding stats,FT is always nice,but all of us had
better items,so grats rot.  =(

2nd one was much harder,group was 56 Dru,53 Rng,55 Enc,51 Pal,
55 Rng(me).Mobs conned white to red to the 51 Pally.
Took half an eternity to take only 1 mob down,my guess is we would
have needed 4 hours to finish it,if members wouldnt have run out of
time and we had to quit shortly after the Gacebo.

Did Qeynos mission once:

Group was 56 Dru,51 Pal,53 Rng,55 Rng(me).
I could have soloed it.
The reward was a 20 hp 20 mana aug,unbeleivable good for such an
easy mission,same Aug costs in Ldon 1150 points!

Melforge 55 Ranger
Mheldur  65 Cleric
