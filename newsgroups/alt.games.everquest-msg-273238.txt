I think your post makes complete sense. I'm a firm believer that
videogames can and do make us better drivers. I think its fairly
simple. When you drive a vehicle you observe the world through windows,
not unlike the screens that we all view our virtual worlds on. You
control your movement through this world via controls - gas pedal,
steering wheel, etc. I believe that maybe our minds are a little more
in tune to this type of control and environment due to the videogames
we play. I have had quite a few things happen in my car that can't be
explained away without taking into account the many years I've spent
playing videogames. Lets here it for hand eye cordination!
