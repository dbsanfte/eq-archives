I agree with that belief.  That's one of the ulterior reasons why I make
sure to vote in every election.  You don't vote, you can't bitch about the
outcome. ;-)

But bitching about it here is virtually worthless.  Bitch at the people who
can actually do something about it.

I sent in /feedback after /feedback about KEI being too powerful for low
level characters.  Finally, one day something was done about it.  Just
because of me?  No.  But if all anyone had ever done was bitch about it on
a.g.e. or EZBoard, I doubt anything would've happened.
