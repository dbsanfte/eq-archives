}  So. From where you sit, it is broken?

Aye, it fails in Netscape 4.79 and Mozilla 1.4, IRIX versions.

Basically, IE will ignore that problem, but most other browsers will not.  
Regardless, having a ';' at the end of your ampersanded escape sequences 
is part of the HTML 4.0 standard.

Either way, it should be easy to fix if your HTML editor of choice has a 
'global find and replace' feature.
