My system = P4EE with 1.5g PC3500, 9800XT video and Audigy 2ZS soundcard. So
I'm using different processor, different RAM, different video card and
different sound card (he's using the onboard Realtek ALC650 audio that comes
with his asus mobo). I think we're about as different as can be. But we
still have the same issue it sounds like.
