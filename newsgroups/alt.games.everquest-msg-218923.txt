I have never been any good at buying the best equipment for my characeters, but
here is my druid if you'd like to have a look...

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=799049

Everytime I get something that I think is awesome, someone always comes by and
says, "You should have <Insert name of item here> as it is better by far than
what you have..."  

So who knows... LOL

Hope I gave you a couple of ideas though...  Also, the rings I have and a few
other items also have LDoN augs on them that are not reflected by the magelo.
