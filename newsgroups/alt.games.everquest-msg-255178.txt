Thanks Rumbledor.

We're actually planning to buy the latest from either ATI or GeForce
(probably GeForce, based on the benchmarks from the Doom 3 engine, and the
prices we can find)...we just dont' see the need to do so until a game
needing it is released, or until we get into a beta of a game needing the
card. :)  IE, we're going to be naughty children and blow our money on a
big toy, but we're trying to wait as long as we can to do so. ^_^  Hence
why this darned cc disk had me in a bit of a quandry. I HATE watching all
the other kiddies playing with the new toys, but $700 for two new cards
just for a utility seems...a bit silly.
