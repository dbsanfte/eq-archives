> So what's the malarky side got?

Funny, I put out a "lure" to see which angle you would bite on.
The "salient" point of my response was my admision that it makes
no difference if born with it or not. I purposely injected an 
element of reluctance/doubt with the word "malarky" to illistrate
two things.  First, to show that regardless of the root cause,
the more significant issue was the behaviour and how it is being
treated in society, which shows that I can objectively look past
past something that may, or may not be of great emotional importance
as to concentrate on a more important aspect. Secondly, it provided
you the same oppertuniety.  i.e. you could have said something like,
"I believe that we are born with it, however, thats not important
here, whats important is how we are being accepted in society".

Bottom line (for me) is this:  Chances are slim to none that "I"
(on anyone else in here) we be able to convince you of my views,
much like the remote chance that you will be able to do likewise.

I don't "accept" gayness, but with the understanding that the 
term "accept" in my heart/mind means "is correct" (the whole
birds-n-bees things, plumbing, cause-n-effect thing).

I oppose the gays forwarding a notion that a sudden re-definition
of the word "accept" to include that we should "believe" in our
hearts and minds that this is Ok, normal, desireable etc.

I'll go to the nth degree to "tollerate" gays, and would never hurt
one, condone hurting one, alienate a personal friend because of it.
However, I would *never* go to bat and defend (even my best friend)
a gay who is getting ridiculed in public.  I would go to bat if
he was getting haressed at work over it (although I would go on 
to explain to him that he has no business bringing "sexual preference"
up at the workplace in the first place. (pictures on desk or not).

I would raise my kids to believe that God did not intend for this,
however, we must understand, and trust that God has a reason for it.

I understand that the term "marrage" is a term that describes the
union between a man and woman and not open for re-definition.

I don't think it is fair to bestow upon corporations the burdon
of having now to re-evaluate having to re-define the term marrage
to determine who gets benefits, and who doesn't. How would such
notion be fair to thoes who may want to, say, marry their sister
or brother ?  You laugh, but selfish to think otherwise...

Beings how neither side is making much (if any) progress in this
debate, I don't see much sence in going forward with it.  It "has"
had some value I suspose, in that it has provided yet one more
venue for both sides to air/voice their concerns (like we really 
have a shortage of thoes).

Further, and quite possibly my fault, as I leave this debate, I
still don't have a "clear" picture of exactally what the other 
side wants.  I mean, I do "kinda" know what they want, but
it appears somewhat foggy.  I'm getting the feeling that they
are wanting unamious public acceptance of this abnormality
such to create a situation whereby no one would be allowed
to crack a gay joke, make a smirk as a gay person, etc. etc.

Good luck with the plight of your cause.
