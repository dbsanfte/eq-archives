Also to be just a bit blunt. America is the number one producer and consumer
of video games . Conforming to odd worldwide standards would undoubtedly put
a strain on our manufacturers and cause costs and thus price to rise
slightly. The number 2 producer and consumer is Japan . They pretty much
already translate all their good stuff for us . Think number 3 is singapore/
s korea and they produce for us as a primary market . In other words your
petition cant help us and could hurt even if it was payed attention to :p

Ob the bright side germans make good board games .....
