Yeah.. that idea is DOA.

If you want to do what Yantis and other ebay'ers are doing.. then do
it. Collect items and cash using traditional farming techniques or
buying from players and resell. The fallacy in their idea is that the
main reason why an item is highly valued is its rarity. Destroy that
and you destroy its value. A Blade of Carnage is 500K in game or $500
outside because it only drops off a 5 day ring of which 0-3 can drop.
That isn't enough of a supply to satisfy the demand for such a useful
item.. and therefore the price goes up. Simply churning BoC's into the
in-game economy will simply satisfy the demand while jacking the
supply. And as players replace that item it gets tossed back on the
market at lower than Sony is selling it for. They then drop their
price.. and it just falls through the floor without the rarity of it
to support it.

Seriously.. if they want to support their secondary markets.. then
support them. Taking them over just ends up costing them more in
subscriptions from out-of-work farmers than it gains them in sales.
