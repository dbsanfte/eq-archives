The "statement of fact" part is what I disagree with.  Having played
both EQ and WoW to a high level, I just have to call bullshit on this.
If you want to say "IMHO, WoW is easier than EQ", well, that's fine.
If you want to back it up with some logical arguments, even better, we
can have a rational discussion.  But when you toss out stuff that
(IMHO) is BS, and don't bother to even try to back it up, it sounds
like you are trying to make yourself feel good by bashing other
people.
