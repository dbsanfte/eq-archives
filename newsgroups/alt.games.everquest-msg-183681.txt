Seeing as how an encounter with the "real" Cthulhu would result in
permanent mental disability (i.e. non-recoverable stat loss), any
EQ incarnation would be such a patheticly pale shadow as to hardly
be worthy of the name.  That's not to say that you couldn't have a
lot of fun with a mob that proc'd an assortment of unresistable mind
attacks against randomly chosen targets (there should be no agro
management option of any sort with an embodiment of chaos, if you're
in range you just might be the next target of opportunity).
