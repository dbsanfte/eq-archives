Well, shortly after getting back on this afternoon I was in search of a
Prophet's Robe for my Iksar Shammy.  Luckily I have 2 computers and 2
accounts, so I am playing my cleric on one and my mule in N FP (Veeshans
market zone).  After 5 hours, nothing!  I did pick up a Cougar Claw Earring
for my monk who is in LOIO.  As I am running from DL to FM to LOIO I
/auction WTB: Prophet's Robe in FM and BAM, got a tell and hooked up to buy
it!!

So I get to thinking, wouldn't it be nice to advertise your auctions over
the entire EQ World?  So I run the idea over /ooc while in DL's and I get a
huge response for it.  So EQSN (EQ Shopping Network) was born.  I have a few
guildies shout out the idea and within minutes 30 or so people are in there
buying/selling, etc.

No I realize I am not this first to do this, espically after reading George
Mealer posted his topic about selling batwings, bonechips, etc.  But I think
it's an awesome idea.  For instance, the same night I ran my Iksar right
into FP :( Thought I was my Halfling for a minute.  I auction for a rez
after being bounced back to FoB and someone in EC is willing to run there to
rez me, awesome!

Now is this had existed earlier while I was in FP, and this guy in FM was
joined, we could've hooked up right away rather then siting for 5 hours.  I
also log my druid on my 2nd computer and do ports while I am grouped with my
1st, and this channel could help people fine ports, rather then being in the
same zone as them.

I think is has potential, and kind of strange to think that on some servers
their market zones are ghost towns.

Well it's 5:30 am and I still havent gone to bed, please tell me what
everyone thinks and some good/bad.  I was always big on IRC and this is
bring back some of the fun =)

Cheers!

Danny
