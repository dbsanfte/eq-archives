What I resent, is not the people who ask politely for a buff, I'm usually
more than happy to oblige, it's the people who expect the buff, who think
it's their god given right to have that buff.  That, and the plat/equipment
beggars.  I know there are those who think it's terrible to even ask for a
buff, but I think most agree that so long as you ask politely, and politely
accept a refusal, there is no problem with it.
