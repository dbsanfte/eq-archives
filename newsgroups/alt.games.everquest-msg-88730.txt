What level are you?

If you died to those mobs you are unlikely to be able to recover your corpse
easily on your own as you need to pass through lots of similar to get to
them. They'll attack anyone, and some are undead and some not, so
invis is of little use.

Your best bet is to get someone level 30 or greater to help you out.
What server are you on?
