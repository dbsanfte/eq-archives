Just how difficult do you think it is for a 59 wizard with that
much AAXP to raise Ring of Scale faction and keep it about KoS?

Standard procedure for Gore is to have the casters out of range of
the AoE until they cast.  It's not that difficult to do on a
Manaburn kill.

The puller (usually a bard, if they use one at all) simply doesn't
bring her back with adds.  I've been in Gore fights plenty of times
and NEVER have I seen an add.  It's not that difficult of a pull.

Even if they kill her in the middle of where she roams, they can
still pick a spot where they won't get adds until they can regain
enough mana for a snare and root.   It's not difficult to avoid
see invis mobs in DL until you get to an area relatively free of
roamers.

!ZERO! risk?  No, of course not.  But the risk/reward is way out of
whack anyway.
