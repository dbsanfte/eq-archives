My apologies, the reason I didn't state what force we will have
available is because I honestly don't know.  We are a relatively small
guild and a high percentage of our members have RL responsibilities
which keep them from always being available.  All in all, we have a
fairly well rounded selection of high 50's-65 players.  I was mostly
trying to determine what force we should make sure we have gathered
before attemting it. 

Thanks to all who responded for the good info.  Especially, the
comparison to Vindi and Trak. That should help us decide when we are
ready.  Much appreciated.
