Don't judge your damage output by the size of your hits.  At 52 the
Wurm might still be a tad better than a Centi, but the difference
would be small.  OTOH a Jade Mace (9/18) should outdamage either of
them, and draw lots more agro (Centi LS offhand still looks good).
If you don't want to mess with 1hb skill Lamentation or Defiance
(both 9/19) would also be good agro getters.
