Indeed, I always show people the betting ring at race courses on any
race day as a perfect example of capitalism.  Watching the various
bookmakers pricing and changing their books on major Festival days is
a different experience to days where there are loads of bookies and
very few punters (e.g. the Sunday of the Thomas Pink) - just watching
them try to chase the bets is fascinating and, indeed, can be
profitable for the punter.

Shame those who live in Land of the Free aren't allowed to see this
and then have to simply suffer the Tote.
