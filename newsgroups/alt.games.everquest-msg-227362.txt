Bingo, that's my big complaint with NBG and always has been. It's always
annoyed me that wanting a share of the loot is considered "greed",
particularly since"loot" in most cases means the purely economic value of an
item since I rarely see people looting things that they're actually going to
use. How often do you see this:

Player 1 loots Boots of Economic Collapse
Player 2: Nice!
Player 3: Hey, not bad.
Player 4: Not bad at all
Player 5: Nice!
Player 6: Yeah, very nice.
Player 1: Can anyone use?
Player 2: Nope
Player 3: Pass
Player 4: What I'm wearing is better
Player 5: Pass
Player 6: Ok, greed roll, ran 100.

I don't know what other's experiences are like, but I honestly can't
remember the last time I saw someone in a group claim that a drop was better
than what they were currently using. In my experience, it seems that the
primary utility of loot is its cash value in funding bazaar purchases.
Looked at that way, there's no reason anyone should have more or less
opportunity to participate in what amounts to a plat split. Even if someone
in the group would use it, why should they be rewarded by receiving the
ten-to-1 benefit simply because they're behind in advancing their equipment?
Is that fair to the others who have spent their time, energy and loot
enhancing their equipment to the point where they've inadvertently opted
themselves out of the opportunity to share in something that they've helped
the group acquire? That seems to make as much sense as arguing that the plat
split should be based on a comparison of everyone's bank accounts.

Well, that might be overstating it. When loot is viewed as economic power, I
don't think it's "dishonest" to say that I "need" this drop even though I
don't plan to use it, since I "need" the cash to fund the purchase of other
items of equipment that I more directly "need".

Very well put, this is precisely why it's not likely to go away. It's like
trying to decriminailize drug use or prostitution. The majority of elected
representatives would probably vote to redirect precious tax dollars toward
more significant and crippling criminal activity, but no one wants to be the
schmuck to stand up on the floor of the house arguing on behalf of drugs and
prostitution.
