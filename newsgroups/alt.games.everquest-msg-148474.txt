Basically, AC and HP are the "most important thing". Other stats:

> STA:    96

Needs to be at least 100. Always.

> DEX:   93

This improves archery (greatly later on) and weapon procs.

> WIS:   88

Getting this high is important for trade skills - though you can have a
separate set of gear just for that.

> CHA:   80

Again, if you practice trade skills to a high level, getting this to 115 at
least is good, but can be done with additional gear.

Also, look at resist jewellery to carry around. When you get to Dragon and
Plane raids, Resists are more important than AC. So have a few items in a
backpack (Like Velium Blue Diamond Bracers for instance) that you can swap
in as needed.

> By the end of the week I hope to have a FBSS and some Crystal Chitin
Gaunts

Look at Silver Chitin Handwraps and a Spider Fur Belt or Smiters Girdle as
an alternative, this will be a significant AC boost as well as +1% haste.
