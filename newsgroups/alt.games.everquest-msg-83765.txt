> And you thought we'd give a shit.....why?

  Because it indicates THEY give a shit about the way their customers
feel.  They are big enough to admit and apologize when they screw up,
and when they back that apology with something substantive.
EverQuest, on the other hand, foists a HUGE technical mess on us that
prevents many people from playing for weeks, and produces horrendously
bad frame rates for another few weeks for some people, and about the
only thing they say is the standard "we're sorry for any inconvenience
this may have caused"... of course, during the "crisis" they have
their phone support staff go on vacation for a week.

  Whatever other failings DAoC has, from this anecdote it indicates to
me that they care a hell of a lot more about their customers than
Verant does.  But then again, that is always my assumption.  I'd have
to be a pretty anecdote indicating really inconsiderate behavior for
me to say "Wow, I that's something so bad I don't even think Verant
would do it."  Maybe DAoC "has" to care where Verant doesn't because
their game is "inferior".  I don't know.  I just know I'd like for
Verant to buck up and say "we're sorry" every now and then, and back
it with some small token of apology.
