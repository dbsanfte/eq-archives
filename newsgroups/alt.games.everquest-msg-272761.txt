I often xp with no rezzer in the group, many people do, usually with a 
druid as the main healer in that case.  In many places, I have, and still 
can, serve as the main healer and slower.  I cannot in the best xp zones, 
the mobs just hit too damned hard even slowed, but a druid can in most of 
them.  Even if a cleric is the main healer in the zones I tend to xp in 
now, a slower is still required, does not have to be a shaman, but a 
slower is needed.
