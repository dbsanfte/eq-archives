Glad to see it work out for you.  You can put your normal exchange
server in the SMTP server slot, and it will allow you to also send
email to folks, if you're one of those posted-and-mailed types.  Not a
lot of them around anymore, and you seem a reasonable fellow.  :)
Either way, your exchange server should allow you to send email from
any mail program, since it uses SMTP to send mail, which is a
standard.  The fact that it's probably configured to use whatever the
name for the exchange protocol to allow you to download mail rather
than IMAP shouldn't be a problem, since POP still works.  The offer
still stands, if you have any questions please email me, I'll get you
straightened out.  
I didn't realize that the cursor is placed at the top of the message
until you mentioned it, but then I noticed that I just give a quick
mouse-click in the window and the cursor is at the bottom.  Muscle
memory is odd when you actually think about the steps you take.
