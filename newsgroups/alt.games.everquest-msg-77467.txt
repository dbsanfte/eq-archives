Ah ok thanks for the confirm ;) I was dreading having to look through
that other 8 page thread for it.

Since it made zero difference to me, I'd guess it will only make a
diff if you are suffering lower framerates because you have an AMD and
an umbra card and there is a bug because the card wants to do umbra or
the game thinks the card is umbral but its not working right?

I'm on a tnt 16 meg agp which is of course not umbra anyway.
