Whats the point? its useless. All servers are up according to
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/  server status at bottom.

And http://everquest.station.sony.com/netstat/index.jsp network status page
says all servers are now open.

I usually check out http://eq.castersrealm.com/ to find out whats going on.
They update there far quicker than anything I;ve yet to see from VI. Which
makes me wonder if I've gotten the right "server status page" to which you
are referring. Is there another one that I'm missing, and if so a link would
be greatly appreciated >)

Cheers
