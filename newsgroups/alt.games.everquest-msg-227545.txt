I believe blacksmithing is one of those skills that falls back to a
secondary stat, if it's higher than Int / Wisdom.   In this case Strength.

So, next time tell him he's a piss poor warrior if his wisdom is higher than
his strength.

If you really want to get him, suggest that with the high wisdom he should
have been a paladin, with the additional bonus that he would then be useful
to groups.
