please don't feed the beggars.  I tell them to piss off.  bet you 100pp that
within a day or so, that character that you just dropped gear and cash on
will be deleted, your item up in the bazaar and them at it again with a new
character.

IF, by some miracle they roleplay a need, and aren't asking for the world
(please sir, can you spare a few gold so a young cleric can buy his first
level spells?)

I'll be happy to help them...or best yet is to hit the newbie yards.  watch
who is doing what...if you see a character looting every single kill, and
the corpse disappearing and they look gearless, I'll engage them in a bit of
conversation and ususally hand them a few plat or an item I recently looted
but have no use for.  But the ones who are just killing everything and not
bothering to loot - you know they are either twinked to hell already or have
a fat bankroll on onother account/character.

there's a difference between beggars and the needy.  Beggars don't usually
(99% of the time) need it, but the needy....
