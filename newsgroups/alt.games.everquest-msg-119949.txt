Having an addictive personality and being prone to depression is both
enviromental <and> hereditary.

If Liz Wooly get's to sue Sony for contributing to her son's "destructive"
enviroment, does Sony get to counter-sue that she and her partner provided
the second rate genes?

A lot of people like to downplay the genetic side as it isn't politically
correct, but it does exist and is considerable. Our family tree is littered
with Compulsive Depressives on both sides and both my parents have a long
history of depression. Out of their four kids - we all turned out to be
nutcases.

3 out of 4 depressives myself included. 4 out of 4 addictives. I was lucky
that alcohol become my drug of choice, one sister completely wrecked by
heroin and another sister and brother have ongoing amphetamine problems.

Blood is thicker than water.
