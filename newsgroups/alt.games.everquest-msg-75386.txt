Fraid it doesn't work that way. Until he actively cancels the account
himself, he'll still be subscribed. (I should know, I am on a monthly
subscrpition atm, and I don't have to go in and re-register every month.)

To cancel EQ, go to the Account screen and choose Cancel Account. It is as
easy as that. You won't be refunded for anything they have charged, but your
account will remain active until the subscription runs out.

Solitude :o)
