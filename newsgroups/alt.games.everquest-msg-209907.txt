yeah, i know, but i ended up picking up some small items so i only have
about 20k, so i won't be getting a fungi...

i decided i don't want to tank, not at all.......i have a war, tanking is
fun, but i've done that enough......and i have a monk, and i can tank MOST
things, but again, it's been done, and i want to be a dps whore ( i just
decided)

that was my rationalization for giving up even my ikky regen, because i want
to force myself to be cool about aggro and use my bow, like rangers should

only thing is, i think archery kind of sucks for *everyone* and rangers are
only good once they're high level and with good aa

which isn't really fair

i have a blessed faydark thunderbolt 30/38 and i usually hit for 30-40
damage, unreliably, with 190 dex and maxed skill (and the archery boost
spell running) . ..  it's kind of disappointing, but fortunately i can level
fast enough that i'll only have to be bored with archery for another two
weeks

YAY EVERLEVELQUEST

but wouldn't the ranger have to be 46 to enter the planes to do the quest?
