Are you truly this delusional and paranoid? 

Nobody "waited to play a Ranger until they were given considerable
bennies". No one could have predicted (not even Verant I suspect) all
of the changes that have occurred over the last 3+ years. People that
play Halfling Rangers do so for a variety of reasons, and not simply
for stats or the 5% exp bonus.

If people find the class more attractive today, it is because of the
hard work and dedication that long time players (yourself included)
put into the class. A new spells, new race, AA abilities, no hybrid
exp penatly, and all of the other improvements over the past 3 years
makes playing the class more enticing. Instead of whining and bitching
you should be celebrating the rise in the Ranger population.

More people are playing Rangers than ever before, and you see it as
some sort of a plague.
