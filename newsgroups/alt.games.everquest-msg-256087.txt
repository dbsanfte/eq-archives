If you think three minutes of sitting is a long time, then perhaps EQ is not
the game for you. :-(  EQ has, by far, more downtime than pretty much any
other MMORPG for solo players.

I used to bring a book when I played, and read during downtime when soloing
my Wizard.  My reading fell way off when I quit EQ!
