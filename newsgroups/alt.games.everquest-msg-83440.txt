Agree with all the previous answers. However note if you ever do by the 
full version (i.e the trilogy pack) then you will not get the free month 
with that UNLESS you start a new account up and use that. Existing 
accounts don't qualify.

I got the PC Zone trial. Subscribed to it. Then purchased trilogy pack 
from
http://www.dragon.ca/ cost me ï¿½30 incl delivery and was with me within 5 
days.

Then purchased Luciln expansion from Game UK. Would definitely recommend 
that you purchase this expansion. Get the trilogy if you want greater 
area to explore. Not really experienced any advantage from the trilogy 
yet, except for having it.

Out of interest if you get Luciln first. Then trilogy. Trilogy will 
install to a separate directory. I suggest you then reinstall Luciln 
over the trilogy to reduce the patching required.
