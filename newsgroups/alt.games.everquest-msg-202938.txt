    Did you notice the poll when you logged in yesterday? Sounds like they
want to know exactly who is doing what, so they know how to allocate
resources.

    I wish that poll had been a "top three" and not a "choose one" poll. If
it had been top three, my top three in order would have been:

1. Raid
2. Tradeskills
3. Group for XP

    And I bet a lot of other people have "tradeskills" as their number two
priority, too. But that means the importance of tradeskills will be grossly
underestimated by the poll.
