its strange.  i had a friend get hacked a few weeks ago.   he NEVER gave 
his pass/id out, but logged on one day to find his 54 druid naked and all 
her no drop items deleted.  being an angry sort, he decided to talk to a 
gm who said there was NO WAY an account could be hacked.  period.  so 
since he does computer security for a living, he decided to see if he 
could prove them wrong.

next day a gm gave him a full restore.

dont know what happened in between.

eq can be funny sometimes...
