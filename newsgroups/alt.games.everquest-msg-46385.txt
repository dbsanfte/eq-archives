Yeah, "peace of mind", just like "duck and cover" is an adequate defense 
against nuclear attack.

Here is the reality:


1:  Gas masks do not work if you are not wearing them BEFORE exposure.
1a: Gas masks do not work at all against some agents.
1b: Anti-nerve-agent vaccines are several years away from usability 
    (yes, some of us have been working on it).
2:  There is no smallpox vaccine to be had.  It has not been 
    manufactured for at least a decade.
3:  The anthrax vaccine is not known to actually work, has not been 
    shown to be safe to administer, and even the military hesitates to 
    use it on their own troops.
4:  There is no vaccine of known efficacy against plague.

The only defense against such attacks is community.  Know your neighbors.
