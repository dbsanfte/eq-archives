Gah, even though for some reason most of your posts get under my skin, for
some reason I have to admit this is the way to play.  I forgot it myself
until I started doing some quests and pursue my life as a chef in eq
again...  The past 6 levels I spent in the dreadlands, excellent xp and it
was fun for 2 levels or so, the next ones were tedious and boring... same
mobs, same scenery, same same same...

I just finished a quest for the testicle of valium or something (+10wis,
+10mana). Excellent quest and relatively easy (did it in about 2hours of
playtime), only bugger is waiting on a named spawn in highhold.

Play the game, experience things, make mistakes, die and learn :)

Cheers!
