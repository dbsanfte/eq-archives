Heh.  There are fast levellers and there are slow ones, and there are 
people who play the game for more than six hours at a stretch, and there 
are those who play for an hour or two and then /camp.  My Iksar 
Beastlord is at level 14.5 right now, and he started his career about a 
month or so ago.  And, heck, I probably wouldn't even be *that* high if 
not for the insane XP in Paludal Caverns.

(And it *is* insane.  I'd heard the stories and didn't quite believe 
them until I went there myself and started watching my XP bar rise 
visibly.  Holy cow.  Happily, I play during the day and on a 
low-population server (Firiona Vie) so I haven't seen much in the way of 
KSing or trains, and I'm actually enjoying exploring the various tunnels 
and caves and marking my map with "Owlbear cubs here" or "fungal fiends 
here".  And taking breaks to fish in the underground lakes.)

*laugh*  Rich druid!  Compared to my Iksar, anyway, who seems to be 
always strapped for cash.  Still, he should have enough for his next 
bunch of spells.  He's working on leather padding (when the proper pelts 
drop) and is saving swirling shadows (since people seem to like those). 
  Got a promising career ahead of him in tailoring, he does -- actually 
managed to make several backpacks from hopperhide pelts and a piece of 
shaded hopperhide armor.

And he's finally amiable to the Guardians of Shar Vahl!  Yay!

Truly, the EQ skinner box was kind to me yesterday.  :)

Keep postin', by the way.
