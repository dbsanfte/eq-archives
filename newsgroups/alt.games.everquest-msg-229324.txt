Ignoring the PvP aspect, melee seems to be a strong choice, actually, 
due to the Hardcore part of the rules set.

I played a couple different characters yesterday, first a ranger, then a 
druid.  When my ranger died, I went out and found my body, looted 
everything, and started over semi twinked.  Only thing I lost (besides 
levels) were the skill ups I'd managed to make, which admittedly were 
hard won.

Later, I made a druid.  Only two spells off the list, HP buff and minor 
heal.  No DD, no DOT, no Snare... practically not a druid at all!  So 
I'd invest some time running the mail in order to buy the basic spells, 
then start playing again.  When I died, the spell book was wiped, I had 
to start all over again.

The ranger gradually accumulated better gear even though he wiped back 
to start just as many times as the druid, the druid was a real wipe, all 
effort gone.  Imagine if I'd managed to hit level 5, when the spells 
cost a plat instead of a gold!  Meantime the ranger was in nearly full 
cloth and weilding a short sword (4/24 instead of his issued 4/29 or the 
4/28 he managed to loot)

It didn't help that the ranger played in the QH area where cash was easy 
to come by as nearly every item could be sold to vendors, often for 
several gold, and the druid in GFay, where I regularly had to clear out 
the contents of my backpacks (one per death you know) of unsellable debris.

Sadly, I have no experience in PvP.  Worse, I have little desire to gain 
any, making my... fascination is too strong a word, but nagging desire 
perhaps... for playing around on the server a clear abberation.

At low levels, do casters really have the tools needed to wreck a 
players day, where melee don't?  I was thinking, for example, of 
archery; with a half decent bow (fletching is an easy and inexpensive 
skill to learn as I recall, although "inexpensive" might be overstating 
things at the very low levels) and arrows you can hit things from an 
astonishing distance, and unlike NPCs a player doesn't automatically 
know where the shots are coming from.

One nice thing for casters on this server is that we can use pets and 
DOTs to kill; in the few duel or arena events I've participated in on 
other servers, these vital tools were banned because they caused exp 
loss; here, ANY death causes total exp loss, and thus any means is fair. 
  I imagine this also includes training, which is an even less exciting 
prospect; is a level 19 monk the ultimate killing machine?  But no, I 
doubt you get PK points for using mobs to kill people.

Splendid
