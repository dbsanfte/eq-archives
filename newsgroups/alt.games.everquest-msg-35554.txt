Okay I've got about 30 plat to spend but could probably work that up to 
150 if I need to - I want to get a nice whip for my ranger.  Why?  
Because I LIKE whips, okay?  :)  Seriously though.  Looked through 
allakazham and they have next to no pricing data even on the few whips 
available to wood elf rangers.  Anyone wanna have a go at telling me 
whether there's anything besides a tailored or leather whip in my future?  
(Or yanno, say "Hey I'll sell you this silken whip of ensnaring/poisoned 
whip for 5 plat cause you're on my server and you're just the greatest 
ever!  I LUUUUUV U MAN!" ... or not.)
