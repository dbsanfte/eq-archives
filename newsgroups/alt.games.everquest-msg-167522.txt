Plenty of true-isms here.

Though most will never admit it, it's simply much more of a blow to be
bested by another player than an NPC. Being killed by an NPC, in the minds
of most, is not such a blow on the ego as it is when you know that the toon
who just cooked you is another person sitting behind a keyboard, just like
you are. That kinda hurts, and I'll be the first to admit it. But that's why
more don't play PvP. I'm not saying that to aggravate anyone, it's just the
simple, unbridled truth. Time for folks to own up to it.;)

There's also the fact that PvP tends to draw the testosterone-laden teenage
crowd. And, although it carries some weight, I think it's just an excuse for
many not to come over. I've been on Rallos since April 1999, and in my
opinion the above crowd is outnumbered by us more sane folk by at least 10
to 1. They're easily silenced once given a taste of their own medicine and
camped for a bit.

It's exacerbated by the possibility, on Rallos at least, of losing a
hard-won item. Coming from someone who not one month ago lost a Froglok Robe
and a Velium Diamond Ring in one night(thats roughly 2500pp worth, kids),
trust me, it's not much fun. But, you move on....

Then again, you play on Sullon, and I wouldn't ever recommend that cesspool
to anyone who isn't certifiable already.
