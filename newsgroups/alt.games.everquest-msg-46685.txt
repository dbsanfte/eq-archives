Err all of them :-(

I am trying to make a cross refference for the RP server of Who can be
what race/religion/class/alignemnt/language etc.

I currently have these tables

Alignment / Class
Alignment / Race
Alignment / Religion
Class / Race

I have some of Race / Language (note a bit differenct on FV)

I still need Race/Religion and Class/Religion

Oh and I think I have worked out how the xp bonuses work.

Jim
