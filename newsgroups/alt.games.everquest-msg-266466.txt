No, I don't think CGW should accept the ads, but thats not SOE's right 
to decide.

Yes, they should.  But again, thats not my call, they apparantly feel 
differently about the matter.

IGE has SOE accounts where it accumulates the pp, and hands it over in 
game to its customers.  So yes, they do have an agreement, and they are 
violating it.

I'm not saying anything can be done about the ads, I'm just saying that 
while you might tolerate a certain degree of violation of your 
principles, when someone takes out a big full page full color ad, you 
can't ignore it and still claim to care about the issue.

Well, I'd buy all the PP I could, on every server, from every company, 
for a substantial period of time.  Then I'd do a chargeback on every 
card, on the basis that I didn't get what I'd paid for; the pp sellers 
don't own any pp after all, and in this case the people who -do- own it 
(SOE) are the ones making the payment.

As a retailer, I can tell you that chargebacks are astonishingly easy 
for customers to get, and very hard for vendors to contest.  Vendors who 
aren't doing business face to face have it even worse.  The CC companies 
get paid by their card holders, not by the CC acceptance company the 
merchant uses

Without some way of telling who the SOE buyers are from the non SOE 
buyers, every single "sale" that anyone makes will then quite possibly 
result in not getting the cash after all.  If the sellers end up turning 
down legit customers on suspicion of being SOE, that won't help their 
bottom line either.

Another plan would be to make small purchases, then watch the accounts 
of the characters who hand over the money, then wait till there's a 
large amount of pp on that account and destroy it, preferably when its 
put into a trade window with a customer.

If there's no cash coming in, and all the pp you accumulate to sell gets 
destroyed, how long do you keep trying?

I don't know if this would work, but I'd be looking for something 
similar to try, at least.  That ad is a slap in the face, publicly 
flaunting their violation in a big way, IMO SOE has to either fish or 
cut bait here.

Course, being SOE, they have no honor, and will do neither, the ostrich 
approach is far more likely.
