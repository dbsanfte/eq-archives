The big problem is that it imports real-world wealth differences into the
fantasy world.  You could be a retired billionaire or some homeless drug
addict kid whose only form of non-drug recreation is playing EQ via a cyber
cafe that you pay for by prostituting youself, but in either case, if you
start a new character, and I (reasonably middle class computer programmer)
start a new character at the same time, we've basically got the same
chances.  If you are the billionaire, you don't automatically get anything
better than me in EQ (except you probably have a better computer, so that
does help a little).  If you are the addict boy-whore, I don't get an
advantage over you.

EQ provides a fantasy world where we can go to escape these RL differences.

When someone can take advantage of their RL wealth to equip their EQ
character, that destroys that aspect of the fantasy world.  The billionaire
can have items that I can never have, because his $10k on eBay will beat my
in-game plat.  Similar, I could afford things on eBay that the homeless kid
could not.

Note that this only really applies to selling items and plat.  Selling whole
accounts is not nearly as disruptive.  If the billionaire wants to come in
and blow a wad of cash to start at level 65 with a bunch of great equipment,
that's fine.  It won't stop me from reaching level 65 and getting that
equipment.  As long as that 65 with great stuff the billionaire buys was
leveled up normally by someone, and acquired its equipment the same way
everyone else does, it's not a problem.
