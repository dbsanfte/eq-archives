WAIT wait wait.. I know that.   I accept that.  I know I'm gonna have to
start over from lvl 1 and go from there.  BUT my idea was more for keeping
freindships and relationships, not for retaining power and the like.  I
don't give a darn if my 60 Paladin (by that time) can't kill lvl 60 mobs in
EQ2.  But I'd like a chance to experience EQ2 in my current form before
starting over.  That way, I like it, start a new char.  If not, go back to
EQ.  I don't WANT to play all of EQ2 with my current character.  I just want
to be able to TRY it with him, and base a decision off of that.
