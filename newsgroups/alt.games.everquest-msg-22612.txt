Well when ever my newbie necro in Paineel needed snake fangs
he would kill a snake and go Not another God Damn F@*king
Sanke egg.  I would suggest the newbie garden in Paineel, it
only has 4 or 5 mob types, snakes, bats, decaying skeletons,
rats, and fire beetles, with a few triggerd mobs thrown in. 
Snakes are probably the least hunted thing there too.
