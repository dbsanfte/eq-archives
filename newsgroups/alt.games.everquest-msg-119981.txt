The bonus to this is that the f-keys all have special usages, and getting 
in the habit of using them is good.

F1 - Target self. Hit it again, it targets your pet.
F2-6 - Target the (first-fifth) person on your group listing(unfortunately 
hitting it twice does not target their pets)
F7 Target closest PC in your line of site
F8 Target closest NPC in your line of site
