Odd.  LDoN has been an incredible help for my Rogue getting groups.  She has
gone from 46 to 50 since I came back.   It can still be a pain in the ass
and take a while to get 6 people with an ok mix of classes so you can do a
dungeon.   We seem to stumble over either gettting a tank or getting a
healer the most.     Often we would have killed for a druid or two, such as
yourself.

Even with the problems left, it's still 1000 times better than it was.
Before it was "run 6 zones" sit and shout for an hour, run 12 zones in the
other direction, shout for another hour, log off in frustration.    At least
now I get picked up.  Although, if  you're looking to do anything in the
game other than LDoN - Mistmoore adventures, you seem to be out of luck.

Overall, I'm liking it.  I've even met a few people who seem to have a clue
what they're doing, amid the groups from hell.
