The problem with getting an answer here is no one likes to be found wrong
and there are a lot of exceptions.  Giants and dragons can't be mezzed
except apparently BW giants can.  Thats the main one, then I think that some
maenads in JP can't be mezzed, and I believe that the hollowshade moor war
defenders and aggressors also can't be mezzed.  There's probably more.  I'd
be very surprised if gods could be mezzed, but I did here of one being
charmed by a reanimated enchanter.
