I never heard that in five years of play, not referring to me, nor did 
anyone complain about someone else's armor in my hearing.  HP total, AC 
total, Haste levels, yes, rarely but you did hear some complaints.  But 
on a sheerly aesthetic level?  Never.

If they do that, they are incorrect; a buff whore is someone who casts 
buffs for money, not someone who gets buffs, even if said buffs are 
wildly inappropriate for them.

If you are soloing, never intend to group, and are playing in areas 
where there are lots more mobs than there are PC's, so you aren't 
monopolizing content that could be making half a dozen untwinked people 
happy, yeah, I got no kick about that.

There aren't many players you can say that about though, most will 
either eventually end up grouping and/or will end up hogging mobs in 
popular areas.  I'm not even saying that hogging mobs is inherantly 
bad... just that "it won't have any effect" isn't true if thats whats 
going on.

Thats an interesting point; if temp cuts your down time enough to make 
the difference between playable and unplayable, then the availability of 
temp might be making cash for SOE.  I wonder to what extent this -is- a 
make or break issue for people.  And I wonder to what extent the "bottom 
line" boys at SOE think this is the case, regardless of the actual facts 
of the matter.

Well, as a person who loves to solo, spent easily half his gaming time 
over several years playing more hours in a day than you seem to play 
during a month, I can tell you that you're missing a lot of the game if 
you stick to strictly soloing.  Forget interaction with other people and 
the fun of that, heck, you seem pretty antisocial, so that might just be 
a chore.  But interaction between different character classes and the 
tools that they bring to the table means that instead of the few options 
for play each class presents, there are dozens of combinations and 
variations you can try.  Even two characters the same class usually 
doubles your effective options, and if it didn't do that, would still 
mean you'd double your kill rate by the simple math of two people 
killing a target in half the time it would take one to do so, and thus 
taking half the total damage.

Its my opinion that this "buff whoring" phenomenum you describe is often
good for an individual, but is in the long run bad for the game itself; 
allowing people to race thru content that was once engaging and 
interesting, reducing the value of many classes to groups, and allowing 
people to play without really having to learn their classes.

I could be wrong, but I'm not sure what you could do to convince me of 
that, I've had a lot of time to think about the issue, and I've heard a 
lot of attempts at counter arguements that haven't convinced me.
