"Your will is not strong enough to COMMAND this weapon". That message
means you're not high enough level for the magic effect on the weapon
to fire off. You "get more will" simply by levelling up.
Unfortunately, there is no indicator on the weapon description of what
level is required. This has to be learned through trial...
