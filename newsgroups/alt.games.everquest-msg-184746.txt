I've been noticing a really odd "Feature" since the new LoY expansion came
out, I'm not losing exp, but rather the opposite, The day of the patch I
logged my little human sk to work on melee skills, and logged out just
before the server came down.

When I logged back on the next day I could swear I had a whole Gold bubble
MORE exp ... I just put this down to my imagination and ignored it.

I thought nothing more of it until yesterday, I had a new UIskin telling me
the exact percentage of my exp on my Beastlord, I logged out at 22%, next
day I came back in to find I now had 33% and had'nt made a single kill O_o

Now either my toons have deveolped a life of there own or I've found one of
the games greatest "features" =)

So what does everyone think ? Should I report this ? or carry on enjoying it
=)
