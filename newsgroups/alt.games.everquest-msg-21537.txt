It's Friday the 13th, what better day to release a new version?

http://www.cws.org/~pasketti

The change most people will notice is that it now understands the new
level-up message.

I've also added a new Loot by Zone report, and a Faction by Zone report,
along with a few minor bug fixes.

Enjoy!
Joe D

Changes:
**        Data file format has changed      **
**   Data files will need to be recreated   **
** You DID keep the logs to do this, right? **

List last seen time for players and guilds.
Tracks damage taken from spells. Note: can only track this from logs made
  after the 17 APR 2001 patch.
Added faction by zone report, so you can see what zones to go to for faction
  work.
Fixed problem with non-friends getting added to friends list.
Eliminated some crufty and unneeded code that would cause the program to
  blow up if a large number of log files were selected.
All "Troubadors" now lumped into "Troubadour".
Zone times over 3 minutes long will no longer be counted in zone time stats,
  in case you go linkdead while zoning.
New "allied" faction reported correctly.
Added loot by zone report.
Fixed bug where reports were being saved in HTML format even when text
  format was selected.
Understands new level up message.
Added "Maxed?" column to faction report to let you know if it's the
  best/worst possible faction.
Understands new corrected sneak failure message.

Good thing the election is over.
Now the Illuminati can get back to business.
