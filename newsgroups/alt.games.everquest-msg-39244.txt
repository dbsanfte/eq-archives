    Supposedly, once you're at Indifferent the price is maxed. The way to
test THAT would be to have a character change faction from indifferent to
amiable, and see if the price changes. And I've done that - my enchanter can
move her faction up a good deal with the Benevolence line of spells, and she
(obviously) is well above the CHA cut-off. Above Indifferent there is no
change in the prices vendors offer to her. She's been using a Diamond
Delores gave her to test with, too, so she could spot tiny differences in
prices. So as long as you /con indifferent, you're at the "Faction cap" for
prices.

    And if ANYONE in the entire game is loved by more races than you, I'd
like to meet them. ;-)
