A bard is my main right now, I love this class. I'm not sure what you mean
about the micromanagement, Im only lev 24 right now and I am finding my
biggest problem is getting my ass up on the hate list and getting attention
pulled off the tank(s) right now. It's nothing to serious I and see I get a
list-wiping type song later which could be used if things get too bad I
suppose.

I dont think you are _completely_ tied,  I think next to a cleric they are
the most demanded players in a group which can be nice (again Im only seeing
low lev action right now though so Im not sure what their later situation
is). I solo'd one mostly (not totally) to 18, and didn't find it that hard.
I have been told the animations do eventually start to get a little tougher
(relatively) later on, but still it's probably the class I least see
solo'ing when I'm out and about.

I love grouping with sk's, I dont know why, maybe I've just had alot of luck
in finding great sk players compared to warriors, but at this point in time
I would prefer to take an sk as tank in a group im in.

I've only played one a little bit, it was like pulling nails out. I haven't
found grouping with them to be too much benefit, but then I doubt I've seen
their true nuking capabilities yet and haven't had the benefit of having one
to taxi me around.
