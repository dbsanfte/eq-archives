You said you like to solo, so I would suggest either a Necro or Beastlord.

Both are very powerful solo'ers from low levels and will get the most from
their racial abilitys (the necro taking advantage of the regen with
health-mana conversion spells, and the beasty getting extra ac and regen
while still being able to wear most if not all the beastlord armour)

Having played a Lizzy beastlord into the early 20's I can say they have some
good and easy newbie armour quests, but seem to stuggle getting hold of a
hand to hand weapon until they can do the claw quest at around 12 ish (by
which time you will have saved the 5 or 10pp to get a PSU anyway).
Plus they get groovy pets.

As your main is a shaman you might be better off going with the beastlord as
the heavier focus on melee will make a refreshing change.
