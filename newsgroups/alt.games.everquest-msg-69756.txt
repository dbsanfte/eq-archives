Sounds like you went to SK. Thats a little tough for lvl 17, but doable.
East karana doesnt have any elephants or centaurs, and is a lower level
zone. There are HG's in EK, but they stay on the hill... well away from he
beach near reaver hill.
In oasis, you are fighting non social monsters, but you might get the
occasional add of a dry bone or mummy, since there is no "safe place" to
pull. In EK, you are fighting social monsters (reavers, wolves, hounds,
stalkers all help one another), so the trick is not to double pull. otoh by
fighting near the water in EK you wont get adds, and medding is very safe.
Oasis can be painful from overcrowding, wheras EK doesnt suffer from that
problem, at least on my server. Id try them both, and see which you prefer.
