Don't be too sure about this.  Think back to EQ1 before Kunark.  For what
most people cared about, experience groups, it was better to give the
healing spot to a Shaman than a Cleric.  Clerics could heal better than
Shaman, but the Shaman's mitigation could reduce the need for healing more
than enough to compensate, and they also had very powerful offensive spells.

The uberness of a class is very dependent on exactly how the game works.
