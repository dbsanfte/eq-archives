I have a paladin that switches weapons all the time. You just have to put
the alternate weapon in a slot
that never changes, and click-drag that slot into your hotkey menu. Then
click-drag your ranged slot
into the menu slot beside it and you will be able to change weapons by
picking them up from your menu
slots.
