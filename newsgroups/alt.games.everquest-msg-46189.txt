I don't think people here really know what "nerfed" means. You are all
citing classes that need improvment and have needed those improvments since
day one. The only class that was truly "nerfed" or made less powerful, is
the Necromancer. This class used to be veritable "gods" in EQ. Then Brad
swung the nerf bat at them a few times and they were relegated to their
currennt state.
