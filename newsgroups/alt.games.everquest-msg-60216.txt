*chuckle* "Harrassment"? It's an automated thing. It won't go away
until you stop playing or answer the fucking question. Where's the
problem? Click "Don't know" if you don't want them to know and be done
with it.

If you're getting this fired up over something so stupid, you'll no
doubt be leaving us a "THIS IS WHY VI SUCKS!11!!! I QUIT EQ1!!1!1"
