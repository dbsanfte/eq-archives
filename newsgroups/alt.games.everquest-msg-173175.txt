The last word is not in my Oxford English Dictionary and I do get the
gist even if there is no need for it here.

Having said that; the US, the UK and countless others have been
supporting, supplying and funding terrorism for donkey's years about
the globe.

Remember 11th September was when the cornered rat bit back - one has
to consider who cornered the thing in the first place.   That simple
bit of wisdom may be a little too close to home for a lot of folk
here.
