Not bad, but you won't be able to do "low level" tuning on a Compaq. 
Considering most people don't bother doing that these days, it's probably
not an issue.

Another 512 memory.  It's cheap, get it for under $100 probably.  You'll
have to make sure of whether you have an open memory slot, though, as a lot
of pre-built machines take the cheapest route and use two 256 meg chips. 
You *should* have another memory slot even if that's the case, but check to
be sure.

Another cheap option would be a second hard drive.  But that may not be much
use to you if you aren't into mp3s, movies, lots of games, etc.

The most expensive option would be a top end video card.  Or, rather, the
next-to-top video card (*top* video card is always dramatically overpriced). 
I like the Nvidia 5900, which is running about $250 retail storefront price,
and can probably be gotten for less during a Christmas sale.

The ram will provide the most improvement, and by far the most improvement
per dollar.  The MX420 video card is fine for running EQ, but the higher end
ones let you turn on more bells and whistles.

Not really.  Make sure you have at least a rudimentary firewall setup if you
are direct-connecting to the internet.
