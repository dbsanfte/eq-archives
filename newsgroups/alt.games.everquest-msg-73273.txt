Ok.  First thing you will need to do if you intend to continue playing EQ is
scrap that Vodoo 3.  VoDoo is dead technology and eventhough there are some
that hold onto it, the switch over to Direct X 8.1 and the change to an all
Direct 3D game engine the Vodoo 3 cannot compete with even the first
generation of Geforces.  I had 512 megs of memory and a P3 650.  Running a
Geforce 1 I have many times where the game became too slow in certain zones
for me to play comfortably.  I went out and upgraded to a Geforce 3 Ti200
and now the game runs great.  Even at a much higher resolution then I once
palyed at.
