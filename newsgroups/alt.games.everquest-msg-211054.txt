Okay, here's my 2cp...

Ranger was my very first char on EQ...I figured he was kind of hard to play,
and traded him off, but kept him.
I still play him, and often times become the tank for the group.

I also have a Shadowknight and a Paladin...HT and LoH are nice but the
reality is, they take so long to refresh, I hardly ever use them so they
will be available in an emergency.

Track is a very useful tool, and Rangers can /tracksort so you can get the
best XP mobs.  Snare and fear are also your friends.  Rangers (like Druids,
who have comparable innate abilities) can be very good solo classes, and
once you start coming into your own (after level 35), you will start to see
how very effective a Ranger can be.  Rangers may not be able to suck up a
lot of damage, but they were never meant to be meat shields like Warriors
are.  If you want to be able to take a ton of damage, play a warrior.

Each class has its positives and negatives, it's an age argument of  X is
better than Y, A is worse than B.  You just need to figure out what best
suits your playing style.  Case in point...I've never played a Monk, but
started yesterday and leveled him up to 20.  I never thought a Monk would be
fun, but I had a blast playing him.

Ok, I've rambled on long enough...hope this was at least a little helpful.
