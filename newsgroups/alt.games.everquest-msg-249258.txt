seriously though...

You mean like Paris? Vegas? Whistler?

Touring a city like Paris is largely to see the art and architecture and 
culture first hand. Most people only go once... you can't marvel at the 
Eiffel tower or listen to the electronic blurb in the tourist booth 
about it more than once. That sort of interesting maps into EQ 
perfectly...most people go to see it once and never go back.

A resort city like Whistler has world class skiing...and people return 
year after year to partake in it. I don't ski in EQ... if I could 
ski/snowboard/tobaggon in eq i still wouldn't. EQ can't support a 
whistler.... or a palm springs or a puerto vallarta. People don't play 
EQ for the golf, the skiing or to lounge on the beach.

A city like Vegas? There is not much in Vegas I'd want to see in EQ 
either. :)
