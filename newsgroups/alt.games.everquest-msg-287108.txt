Couldn't you have got your corpse the next day?  I thought that it
didn't decay for a very long time.

Oddly, I do and it's the biggest beef I have about WoW and I've always
said that I think that it is missing something by making death be so
trivial.

It's so pointless that you'll think nothing about attacking a large
group that contains the named mobs you want knowing that you'll die
and can get the other half of them when you res (or not need to if you
get the specific mob before you die).  When I played EQ you lost
experience and maybe even a level when you died and I wouldn't have
ever considered doing something like that.
