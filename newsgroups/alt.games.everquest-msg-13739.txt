You ever seen how much effort the police put into finding a lost wallet? Now,
do you really think the FBI is gonna spend a few hundred man hours
investigating some claim that your EQ password was stolen by someone? Just
because they don't look into the claims does not mean that it isn't happening.
My god, these same people steal university accounts just so they can send prank
mail that can't be traced, or to delete the term paper of someone who they
often don't know. That is little more than whim. They also attack corporate
america for nothing more than whim. Some also do it for dollars. Do you really
think they are not going to be bothered with an EQ account that will  loot them
a few hungered dollars?

================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."

                   From "Travels with Charlie"
