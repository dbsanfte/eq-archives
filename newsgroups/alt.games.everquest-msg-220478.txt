What do you do when those cats die?  There aren't anymore to replace them,
everyone else in the world thinks your right and there are no more cats
being born.  :P  Before you pipe up that it's taking an example to an
exaggerated extreme, realize that I made a point several posts back about
the actual problem being unfixable and all you can engage in now is
genocidal damage control.  People *always* accept the rights and deny the
duties, always have.  This gives people an easy way to deny the duty (at the
expense of their pets).  Those who can't, or won't, accept such duty simply
should not be pet owners.  If the pet owner population was cut down by a
factor of 50, that would probably be about right.  Those pet owners that
would be left over would be the ones that actually care about their pet as a
being rather than an ornament or toy.

If I had a desire for another cat, my current pet of 9+ years is an
exceedingly good-tempered, friendly cat, along with being a beautiful
specimen of manx, which would make the obvious course be to breed him. 
Would suck to decide that now and have had him fixed as a kitten before it
became apparent what a good example of all that is cat he is.

That's for the sake of argument, as I've already bred him in the past and
probably won't get another cat in the foreseeable future (my kid turns 5 in
three days, about time to think about a puppy).
