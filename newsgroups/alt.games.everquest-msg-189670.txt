I have same model and was going LD at least 3 times a night, over a 4
hour period.  It was irritating to say the least.

I removed some files like eqclient.ini, eqmain.dll, and a few others.
Downloaded them the next time I logged in and haven't had a problem
since.  Wasn't based on Linksys firmware either since I upgraded
trying to solve the problem.  Both versions had LD issues.

[afk]

I just looked at my list and the exact files I removed were:

eqmain.dll, eqclient.ini, eqoptions.ini 1,2 and 3, datarate.txt

If you don't have all eqoptions.ini files don't worry, just remove
what you have.

Hth.
