Everquest works well, we run 2 pc's from it without any hitches.

They are based in WA and have really good pricing with plenty of
download/upload limit . (churn is free at the moment!).
Only took two days once advised of changeover, and they keep you up to date
with sms text.

Only downside is the time zone difference if you have a query.
