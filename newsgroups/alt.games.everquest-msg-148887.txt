FWIW, I think this is because the Hammer of Judgement is designed to
have a ridiculous proc rate.  Maybe the dex increase works as a
multiplier.  The bigger the base proc rate of the weapon, the bigger
difference dex will make.

*shrugs*

All I know is that, even going over 200 dex with Boon up, I seen no
significant difference in any of my procs with my ranger.

In the parses I've seen, the difference that dex makes for melee is
statistically small, even at fairly high levels of dex.  Granted, I
don't have any of the links, so take that as hearsay.
