I wouldnt expect so. I would expect them to be in the same general
area as the PoD. If you arent welcome inside townhalls then you need
to bind in a town that is safe to you. I dont expect as a DE to be
able to go inside FV to bind. I see people doing that in the Outpost,
trembling in the corner hoping a Dragoon doesnt find them. The
mechanics of the game are such that they probably wont assist players
in binding in areas where they shouldnt be.

p.s. I wouldnt be suprised if after the patch someday they make the
Dragoons march along the beach and up to the wall and back. After all,
theyve found people littering over there and want to make an example
of them.
