Yeah, I guess that's one way to look at it!  Ironically, now I can't
even patch the game because I am only running Windows 95 on my current
system.  So the new patcher won't even let me download new patches
anymore.  (I had planned to continue patching the game even though I
could not play it, and then transfer the files from my current system
onto the new one, once it arrived)  But the new patcher won't even let
you download files anymore unless you have DX8.1.

And of course DX8.1 does not support Windows 95, so I can't even patch.
Unless I upgrade my OS.  (Which is something that I don't really want to 
bother to do on such an old system)  I dont think it would be worth the
trouble.

*sigh*  So I will have to wait two or three weeks (or more) to get the
new computer...

What would be the harm in simply allowing my poor Windows 95 system to
continue to patch the game?  So I could remain "current"?

They could still check for DX8.1 after the patch download and prevent
me from playing the game then...

Oh well.. I guess I wait...
