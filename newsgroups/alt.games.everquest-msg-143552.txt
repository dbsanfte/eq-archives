Heh, have you played a low STR warrior?  Warrior gear is generally
heavy, my (now retired) half-elf with an 80 STR had a terrible time
in his twenties and early thirties when he started to be able to
afford some better than crap gear.  You can easily hit 90 to 100
weight just with your everyday gear, food, and minimal changes of
weapons, and that's using an EE Bag which the Rallic would not be
a huge upgrade for.  That's one of the reasons my wimp warrior
retired at L32.  But Freeman was talking about a L52, which is why
I suggested looking for alternative pieces of gear in the bazaar
and using stat food.  He didn't list his gear, but I would be
surprised if he couldn't fill a couple slots with equivalent gear
that is either very low weight, better plus STR, or both.
