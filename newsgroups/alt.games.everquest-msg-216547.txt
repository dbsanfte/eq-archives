I'm of the opinion that Sony would have been wiser to *not* name it EQ2,
but call it something completely different.  The only thing about EQ2 that
*isn't* totally new and novel is the storyline/history of the
world.

However, to all you people who like EQ2 who are defending it against EQ-L
players...shush!  Or at least, shush until Beta is over! Do you *really*
want more competition????
