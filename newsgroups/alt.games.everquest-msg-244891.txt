I reserve the right to be torqued off today=)

hm, or maybe I just have the screaming funk....

Nope, torqued off at SOE summs it up=)

[rant] had a go at making a ceramic blade of war since I scored the 
living coal i needed this morning, and got a message that i couldnt make 
it because of my skill level...and I have a 200 pottery=( I have never 
gotten an experience message like that. I could understand a suck it up 
you failed message...but there is nothing on the recpe saying that I 
couldn't have a go making it at 200=([/rant]
