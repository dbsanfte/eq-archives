Only Rogues get the message to tell them that hide was successful, Dark Elf
natural ability (as with wood elves) will often take a few attempts to get
to work, only way you can tell is by either being told by another player or
by con'ing something that doesn't already con as indifferent.  SK's actually
get hide as a skill at 35 but it caps at 75.

I have not seen one used but from what I was told it enabled SK's and
Necro's to pull with the same efficiency as a monk.
With their FD spell not being as good (casting time, not instant effect) the
instant invis helps split adds as only the mob you engaged holds aggro when
invis is used...obviously you become visible on each hit from the aggro'd
mob but chain casting it would apparently get rid of the extras. This was
why it was nerfed.
I could be completely wrong about that, again this what I have been told and
not what I have seen done.

I was offered one for 500pp before the patch that nerfed them...couldn't
think of any real use for it at the time so didn't take the seller up on it.
the bruising I gave myself after the patch took weeks to clear :ï¿½)

They are no where near 30k on Bristlebane, more around the 10k mark now.
