What makes Everquest fun is what you personally put into it and what
you get out of it.

Are you a power gamer?
Are you a casual gamer?
Do you play to socialize and make friends? 
Do you play to level up?
Do you play to get "phat lewt"?
Do you play to Role-Play?
Do you play to do trade-skills?
Do you play to Raid?

Any single or combination of the above playing styles is legit and can
be rewarding and fun. The key is to play the style that *YOU* enjoy.

From your description I would guess that you enjoy the challenge of
levelling 1-51. So if you still want to play, roll another character.
Then when you lose interest in that one, roll another until you decide
you don't want to play anymore and that EQ is no longer a game that
you want to play. No one is forcing you to play EQ.

So, don't play the 51-60 game. It isn't for everyone. I retired a Monk
at 53, because the game ceased to be fun for me. It wasn't the games
fault (thousands of people enjoy the higher level game). It just
wasn't my style. Perhaps it isn't your style either?

>Raiding: This is fun?

For some people yes. For you, maybe not. Do what you think is fun.

>Loot: This seems to cause more strife and guild breakups than
>anything.  And for what?

Most people enjoy getting new things. It is a challenge and they find
it rewarding. Others are blinded by greed and will become complete
jerks over loot. If that is a problem in your guild, find another. The
worst thing you can do in EQ is to hang out with people who do not
play the same way that you do. It ruins the fun for you and for them.

>Socializing: .....but EQ friendships are mostly bogus.  I guess the type of folks who frequent internet
>chat rooms enjoy this.

That is your opinion. The relationships you develop in-game are only
as strong as make them. Some people develop incredibly strong bonds. A
few have even married outside of the game. There is nothing "bogus"
about long distance relationships. Before the Internet people
exchanged letters and were called "pen-pals". That is the beauty of
communication. It doesn't require face to face contact.

>Er, so what exactly is fun about the 50+ game?

For you maybe nothing.

Don't play it if it isn't fun. There is no prize for getting to level
60, and there is no penalty for staying level 10 or re-rolling a 100
different characters.

There are hundreds of Class/Race/Diety combinations. You could spend
years playing the 1-50 game going through them all.
