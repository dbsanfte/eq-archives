Yep.  But Palindrome's first post did not present things in that way.
As he described it they wanted the Warrior to pull the HG, hold it
while they dolled it up with DoTs/Snare/Root, and then stand back and
be useless for a while.

And hell, in the case of HG hunting any group or soloer is ignorant|
stupid|shortsighted|parasitic (choose up to four) if they're not
slaughtering PHs.
