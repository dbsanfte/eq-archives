If I know SOE like I think I do, the "offline bazaar" feature will
be part of a future expansion; i.e., it'll be a must-have feature
which helps ensure everyone buys it whether or not they want the
rest of the content.

They seem to do that with every expansion.

I got pretty severely flamed in a.g.e for suggesting that approach
would be superior...
