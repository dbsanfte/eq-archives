The goal's only to get one cleric bound/logged. If you get killed
after being bound, you pull the plug and get on an alt. There should
be someone FDed at SS, saying when to log back in. A fair amount of
the time people make it with no agro anyway, so it's not a big deal.

Probably one of those mistakes you don't make twice. ;)

It's really not for the faint of heart, but we've broken Fear many
times this way. We've been pretty successful; I don't know the last
time we had a long CR (more than 30 minutes to start clearing) there.
