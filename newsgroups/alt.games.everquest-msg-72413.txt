Heh, I like making the Gfay newbie guards attack (and kill) the PoD, 3
newbie guards vs. 1 PoD, the PoD has never yet managed to kill a newbie
guard before going down (including his 2 Cheals at about 20%)

Oh, the trick is, with my druid, charm a bat (yes, they're animals) and
target the PoD, type /pet attack while you're standing with the newbie
guards between you and the PoD and watch the mayhem begin.

I do like the PoDs "I killed you" shout though, not quite as good as
Gorenaires though.  (and yes, I've met both of those shouts head on)
