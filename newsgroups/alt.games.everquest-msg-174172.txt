That one is easy. You can't trust Saddam, and Saddam surely as hell 
won't trust the US after all that's come down in the last ten years (not 
to mention the fact that the US is a fickle friend to dictators, as 
Manuel Noriega surely understands now). After Gulf War I, there could be 
no more buddying up to Saddam. Saddam needs to go.

Whoever ends up in charge in Iraq will be in a weak enough position to 
almost entirely depend on the US (not unlike Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan). 
As for other countries reacting badly to the war and shutting off the 
oil... They know what's coming down, and they have sided themselves with 
the US, so they have little choice but to be along for the ride when the 
crude hits the fan, so to speak. On the whole, the ruling families of 
Saudi Arabia have too much riding on US friendship to start rocking the 
boat now (and of course, Kuwait is not likely to complain if Saddam is 
crushed underfoot). The only real peril is a Islamic fundamentalist coup 
in either country, but then, nothing risked, nothing gained.

To be honest, "we're doing this in order to increase our influence on an 
important oil producer" sounds a lot more plausible than "Iraq is a 
credible threat to us".

There is no need to invoke paranoia, or claim a conspiracy. Everything 
that is being done is above water and plain for all to see (except of 
course for all the intelligence work being carried out to decide, or at 
least influence, who will be Saddam's succesor. This must happen whether 
the war is over oil or over WMDs, so it's neither here nor there for the 
purposes of this conversation). The use of the word "conspiracy" would 
indicate that something is being done that we don't know about, which I 
don't think is the case; I think all the "whats" are there in plain view, 
it's only the "whys" that are being kept from us. The question is "are 
politicians being honest as to the reasons why this is happening?", or 
in other words, "would this war take place if Iraq's primary export were 
figs?". You seem to think it would, and that's perfectly okey; me, I'll 
keep asking myself 'Cui bono?'

One last word on conspiracies... the word "vast" seems to be easily 
attached to them in order to dismiss them more easily, but if there were 
a conspiracy of any kind here, it needn't be vast. This is the kind of 
thing three people can decide over coffee; after all, there is no 
setting up to do, Saddam Hussein has kindly done all the hard work 
already.
