I hadn't noticed this before, and it -is- handy, but its -not- a formula...
I go up a level a day it seems, and each level that would mean
going back and looking up that level's worth of songs.

On the other hand, just checking out this plan has already been
a great revelation for me.  Chords of Dissonance, a song I
haven't used much because of its minimal effect, is a string
based song.  Way back when I was using this cause its all
I had, I wasn't up to juggling out weapons and slapping in
a lute.  Now, however, I have a primary equippable lute
(vah shir quest lute, I highly reccomend it to all you cats
out there too cheap to get a Lute of the Howler) and am
regularly swapping it in on the beat for Hymn.  Since its
already in hand, I can twist in Chords also and swap
it in on -that- beat as well, still without sacrificing much
in the way of weapon damage output.  I knew that strings
would help, but had no idea they would -triple- the output
of this song!
