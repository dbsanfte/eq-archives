When I was a real newbie level 13 dwarf fighting in Butcherblock I had
some simple banded armor, a blood forge helm I got from the Ogre
Quest, a handful of gold, and a balanced shan'tok.  Nobody gave me a
full suit of (dyed red no less) fine plate armor.

Perhaps you had a few pieces of bloodforge armor, 100 gold, and a bag
or two full of bone chips?  That were be much more believable for a
non-twinked 13 pally dwarf in Butcher Block.
