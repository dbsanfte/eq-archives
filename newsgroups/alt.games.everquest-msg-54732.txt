A fellow guildie, got a decent item, I think it was called Amulet of the
Warlord, not certain. stats are:

Race:  All
Class: WAR
Stats:  Magic, Lore, Nodrop
          Neck slot (I'm pretty sure it was neck)
          AC 4, STR 4, +10 all resists

Not sure about the weight or what it dropped off, it was dropped in Rathe
Mountain.
