I've been doing LDoN's on and off, and have accumulated a few points 
(not many, low level LDoN's yeild very few per run).

I've got up to the point where I could afford a low level adventure 
merchant augment, and have done a little window shopping.

I've looked, in particular, at weapon augments, and it strikes me that 
there's something inherantly unfair about them, unless I am missing 
something.

One type of augment raises the damage of a weapon by a set amount.

Take a 10/20 weapon, raise its damage by 2, and you've taken it from a 
.5 ratio to a .6 ratio.

Take a 20/40 weapon, raise its damage by 2, and you've taken it from a 
.5 ratio to a .55 ratio!

Thats half as much improvement.

How about a proc augment instead?

Well, say we get the one that procs 50 DD.  The 10/20 weapon will proc 
twice as many times per hour as the 20/40 weapon!

Now the obvious conclusion is simple; go with light fast weapons over 
big slow ones; heck, there are other reasons to do so in many cases, and 
not all that many not to.  While there may have been a balance of sorts 
between the two, it seems clear that augments tip the scale dramatically 
in favor of the light/fast weapon.

Here's another thought on weapon augments.  With normal augments, I can 
now use a solvent to remove it from an item I'm replacing, and put the 
augment back on the replacement.  And with a large number of slots 
available on my body (only my charm and throwers fail to have a slot) 
and most augments usuable on any slot, I can afford to put cheap 
augments on now, and look forward to getting better augments without 
these being a waste for quite a while.  Only when I've filled every last 
slot on my body and then get another augment will I have to finally 
start discarding some of the ones I got when I was young.

But weapon augment; well, I've only got ONE weapon slot (most classes 
have two).  If I get an upgrade to my weapon augment, then whatever I 
put into the first one is now wasted, unless I'm the sort who carries a 
golf bag full of different armaments around, one for every purpose. 
Even so, a weapon augment seems the least likely to stay useful.

All of this is fairly academic, I have two stat augments and enough 
points to buy, at best, a 50dd proc augment, and my dex isn't high 
enough to make me think much about that.  But its interesting for the 
future, and moreover, to me, as something to think about in terms of how 
things are set up and balanced in general.
