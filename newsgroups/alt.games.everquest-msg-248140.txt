Is DAoC really that popular? I recently purchased it, tried it out, and....

While the graphics are awesome, the game leaves a lot to be desired, at
least for me. Maybe I'm just too used to the EQ interface, but to me, it
seemed bulky, cumbersome, very non-user friendly, and just plain annoying.

Which reminds me, I need to cancel my subscription on it before the free
month is up so I don't actually start paying for this thing...
