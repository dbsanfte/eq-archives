You are still wrong.  Non-political speech is explicitly not
protected, and the hate speech laws are being enforced.  See

Jones v Toben [2002] FCA 1150 (17 Setpember 2002)
(which upholds censorship of the Adelaide Institute website)

Jones v Scully [2001] FCA 879 (13 July 2001)
(censorship of anti-Semitic speech)

Creek v Cairs Post Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1007 (31 July 2001)
(censorship of the press wrt publishing an unflattering 
photograph of an Aboriginal family)

and others.

Interestingly, the Federal Court of Australia has held that
the truthfulness of the offending claims is irrelevant -- that
censorship is called for merely if the speech is considered
offensive.  To wit, in Jones v Toben (regarding Holocaust
denial):

"... it is not for the Court in a case of this kind to seek
to determine whether or not the Holocause occrred.  No doubt
it was for that reason that no attempt was made in this case
to lead evidence on that topic.  The role of the Court is to
determine whether the applicant had substantiated his 
complaint that the respondent engaged in conduct rendered
unlawful [by the law against offensive speech]..."

The court uses definitions that hold that it is unlawful to engage 
in speech that "irritates in mind or feelings," "to treat
isolently or with contemptuous rudeness," or "to lower the 
pride or self-respect of," among others.

In Creek v Cairns Post Pty, further, the court held:

1) That no offense was intended is irrelevant.
2) "For behaviour to fall within the racial hatred
provisions of the [Racial Discrimination Act] there
is no requirement that it be shown as having its
basis in actual hatred of a race."


You are building up an interesting set of case law, there,
and it *does* have direct bearing on "people can and do do it in 
society in general."

Interestingly, proposed changes to the Australian 
Freedom of Information Law will protect the government
from having to reveal its censorship efforts.

Your speech freedoms are less today than they were 
yesterday, and they are disappearing as you read this.
