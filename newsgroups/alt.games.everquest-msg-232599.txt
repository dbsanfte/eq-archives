I'm sorta getting stuck in EQ these days. I feel ready for elemental planes,
and "taking it to the next level", and I have the necessary time right now
to dedicate myself to doing it.
Problem is I play on CET (EST +6), which gives me limitations when it comes
to raiding on my current server. All the higher end guilds play on PST/EST,
and since I work everyday from 8 AM - 4 PM I have no way of doing everyday
raids with an American based guild.
So, can anyone recommend a solid Euro-based guild that is just hitting the
elemental planes, and is accepting applications right now? (I'm a 65 druid,
with pretty OK gear, and solid AA's). I'm prolly available to raid 4-5 days
a week.
I'm willing to make a server transfer, with full gear.

L.
