Personally I have often wondered why Verant doesnt create a banking LOAN system
in EQ. Take out a loan for 10kpp at the bank,  pay $100 for it on VISA,  plus
interest on PP loan, make payments back in PP to bank (ends up being 11kpp
say),  when its all paid get $50 back. Be a good way for them to compete
against people selling PP on RL auction sites and stay within the intentions of
the game,  ( Have YOU ever heard of a bank that doesnt LOAN money? )
