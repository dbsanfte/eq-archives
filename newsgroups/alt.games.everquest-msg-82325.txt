Last night I was chatting to a fellow chanter who told me that from  lvl 34
and up the research spells can be bought from somewhere in Luclin!!!!! Sorry
I forget where, will post info when I can get it (or someone else can fill
that one in<)  )

I don't particulary like it, seems to go against the whole point of the
research idea,  but I wasn't going to turn the chance down of gettin some
desperately needed spells... Radiant Visage most of all (Cha buff)

I was  very very lucky  in that the chanter I was chatting to had her druid
bound there and didnt mind doin a spell run.. you have to run through a ver
high lvl zone.

Cheers

Kev
