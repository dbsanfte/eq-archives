Chainmail is a huge mistake.  Vendor purchased armor is a ripoff, pure and simple.
If you have a small gift of twink cash (or sell stacks of bone chips or something
like that) at low levels, buying a full suit of leather isn't a bad deal, but everything
above that sucks.  For the same money (heck, lots -less- money in most cases)
you can buy better armor from players.  Your Chain, for example.. two pieces for
65pp?  For under 100pp you could get a full -suit- of banded, each piece superior
to your chain outfit.  In fact theres a good chance that for your 65pp you could
buy a piece of player made Fine Plate, with better AC on it than vendor plate and
far far cheaper.

The corallary of this is, don't sell to vendors if you can avoid it.  Sell a vendor
something that he offers you 10pp for, then try to buy it back.   Whats this,
he wants 100pp?  Yep, thats how it works.  Sell it to a player for 20pp you'll
be making twice what you would have to the vendor... and yet the player will
be paying a fifth what he would have had to pay the vendor for it.

Oddly, adding 4 points worth of AC in items won't add 4 to your AC, it will add more
like 10... your AC is not simply the combined AC of the items you are wearing, its
a multiple of this, with your agility and defence skills factored in somehow (I'm sure
a melee oriented player can explain in more detail.

As an 11 paladin, your sword is not performing up to par... your damage 1-10 was capped at 20, now it is capped at 29...
while you should be expecting blows in excess of 40 on the high end.  If you can find a weapon with the same ratio, but
a lower damage (and delay, of course, in order to keep the ratio the same) you'll see yourself hitting for more
damage per minute.

AC matters a great deal, or not at all.  Mobs have an effective range in which they do damage versus AC.  If your AC is in
that range, then every little bit will mean a coresponding small degradation in their ability to hurt you.  If your AC is under
that range, then there is practically no difference between naked and whatever your AC is at, they will still hit for the same
average damage.  And if your AC is much much higher than their range, then they just can't hit you for beans and another
few points of AC isn't going to matter.

If you forgo improving your AC, wearing leather and chain as a level 11, you will start getting hit harder and harder the
next few levels, until by the time you are 20 you'll be getting smacked around as hard as an enchanter wearing raw silk.
Trouble is, you are -supposed- to get hit, while his job is to avoid the blows.  AC is arguably your most important stat as
a paladin (or warrior or shadowknight)

It will be a long long time before mobs will drop good stuff for you to wear.  What you do is get say 10 drops of relatively
crappy stuff, sell them, and buy one item worth 10 times what any one drop you looted sold for.  That stuff, of course, was
looted by someone 10 levels higher than you, who is doing the very same thing with the stuff he loots... selling it to you
in order to save up and buy a good item from someone ten levels higher than him.
