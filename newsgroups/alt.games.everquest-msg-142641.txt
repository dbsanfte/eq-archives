This is an excellent point about EQ, it's the same core of play, but how you
have to play changes. As a warrior, my ability to solo ended at about
L25-30. From 30-50 I needed anyone to group with me (healers and other
melee's preferred), and from 50+ I more than anything I need LOTSA HP and
LOTSA AC, because my role make me a big meatshield.

Just be aware that how you play your char will change as you progress
through EQ.
