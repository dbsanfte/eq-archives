If you have a spell that generates a lot of hate, one thing comes
to mind, and thats that it should be good for getting and keeping
aggro.

Crazy, you say, why would a druid want aggro?  Ah, well, its
called Hate Kiting.  Get mob mad at you and you can lead it
around while the rest of your group does whatever they like to
it.  This is decent with melees, especially with DPS melees, but
even better with pet classes, since pets usually have less
trouble staying at melee range to a fleeing snared mob.  SoW the
pets, tell em "no taunt", snare the mob, and then get it really
good and mad at you and run it around.  Better than fear kiting
because you have more control over where the mob goes and don't
keep having to waste mana refreshing a spell thats not doing
anything good.  Decreasing the AC of the mob the pets are beating
on shouldn't qualify as "not doing any good"
