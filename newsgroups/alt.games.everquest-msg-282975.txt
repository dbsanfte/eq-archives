Aye, I'm actually fairly impressed that they keep revamping zones, though I 
have no idea of their reasoning for what zone to do when. Looks good 
though.

Ahh, the multi-box. Well, I can tell you that I can run two instances of EQ 
on my machine and if they are both in windowed mode, I have no problems 
whatsoever ALT+TAB'ing. Well, occasionally EQ has a problem with my ATI 
card and can't seem to remember my gamma settings between instances, but 
aside from that it works very well. What I've done is just replicated my 
entire EQ directory and set my second account up to run from the second 
directory, also setting all graphics features to the bare minimum in the 
interests of saving system resources. Also, the two instances are set to 
overlap completely so that only one instance is drawn at a time.

Other people might mention using EQWindows or WinEQ or the like for all 
your ALT+TAB'ing needs, and that might work fine (or even turn out to be 
necessary) for you as well. As a matter of fact, I can remember hearing of 
someone running 4 instances of EQ on one machine - each set to 800x600 on a 
1600x1200 desktop so that all were completely visible at the same time. It 
was certainly not with all the new models turned on. As a matter of fact, I 
think it required all graphics be set to minimum.
