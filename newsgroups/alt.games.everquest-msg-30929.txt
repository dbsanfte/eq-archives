Well if you were below level 6, you wouldn't have enough cash to work 
with anyway.  And what good is stupid enough to say "oh sure you're going 
to go buy supplies for us.  Here's 5000 plat".  But it's easy enough to 
set up - just do a /who all <some class that includes 'good' races>, 
contact one of em, and set up a run.  As for running through unsafe zones 
- well, I'm sure there are characters I could choose to make it at least 
partially safer.  For the rest?  That's where that 'extra element of 
risk' some people talk about comes in *g*
