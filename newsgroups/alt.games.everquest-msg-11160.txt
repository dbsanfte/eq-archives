I group quite a bit with guild members, but I also like being able to
solo with my necro when I choose.  I have gotten a lot of mileage in
the past out of spots like the treants in SK, the troll guards in
Rathe Mtns, the spirocs in TD, and the forest giant fort in Burning
Woods.   In all of these places I could snare/fear without worrying
much about getting jumped by adds.  Does anyone know of spots like
that I could use for the mid 50's and up?
