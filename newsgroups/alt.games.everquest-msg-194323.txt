Is there a guild based on Australians on Morell Thule that a lvl 34 bard
could join?

Or any guild on Morell-Thule that posts guildmotd with a GMT value, that
a lvl 34 bard could join.

I'm really looking for people that realise that we don't all eat and
sleep at the same time and that a lot of us have watches that show
different times.
