That's fine, but I have to conclude that any thoughtful Christian
would probably "play it safe" and not support capital punishment,
unless the position of the Bible on accidentally killing innocent
people was made crystal clear.

It also tends to reaffirm my opinion that Bush is not a very
thoughtful man.  I think his answers are always simple because he
himself is simple.  Not a good attribute in a president.

It's too bad we'll be stuck with him for another four years.

Oh, by the way: It looks like Vice President Dick Cheney got caught in
a web of lies and distortions during the Vice Presidential Debate:

It looks like the Bush Administration policy continues to be one of
lies, lies, lies, and if necessary, more lies.
