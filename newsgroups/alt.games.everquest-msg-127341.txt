Long fight = dead solo rogue, or plenty of chances to step back and take a
break.
I'd always thought STA and endurance was only a concern of 'real' tanks
swinging the heavy iron... something a Rogue shouldn't really be doing
anyway.

Eh???

/agree... which is why I mentioned the small AC increase...
More important are the defence skills... Dodge (lvl 4), Parry (12), and
Riposte (30)... higher AGL will reduce the time needed to max those skills.
AC only reduces the damage you take when you get hit... you take no damage
if you don't get hit.

Proc, proc, proc, proc... what IS it with people raving about weapon procs?
Yeah, sure... they're nice if they happen... IF they happen, IF they're not
resisted, and IF they don't bring the agro onto you when you're not MA, IF
the proc is useful (Adam Bo Stick/Sword of Skyfire AE proc sux if you're not
careful).

Dex = landing a Backstab... if you miss, it doesn't matter if your STR is
250... it's still a miss.
A Rogue who can't land a backstab is worse than dead... he's an XP leech
who'll spend his whole life LFG.

Dex = Ranged... IE Thrown (a Rogues only chance to CRIT) weapons.

Dex = Picking Locks and Pockets... admittedly, both those are implemented
badly... but they ARE skills unique to Rogues.

Stamina items aren't hard to come by... it's just that STA is never the
primary stat of the items people sell in EC/Gfay.
