That's nice.

My given name is indeed Gaston.  Kaev is the name of my most-played
EQ character.  It is also the handle I use here and when posting to
EQ-related boards.

Nope.

You are absurdly over-sensitive.  Or at least that's the kindest
explanation I can come up with for the pathetic thrashing about
that you're doing here.  Take a few deep breaths, get your thoughts
(or whatever it is that passes for thoughts in that sad shriveled
mass of atrophied grey matter hiding within your cranium) in order
as best you can, and give it another go.  I'm sure you can manage
some weak excuse for an insult that's at least vaguely pertinent,
if only you try your best.
