Personally, I agree completely that the new graphics blow the old stuff 
away. I really don't understand how anyone could prefer the old boxy 
super-imposed looking models to the new stuff, but to each their own, I 
suppose. 

I think a lot of any unpopular opinion stems more than anything from the 
performance hit you take when running the new models, especially on large 
encounters like raids. I mean, sure, there are gonna be some aspects of 
the new models that are worse (the Ms. Roboto stances of the female 
barbarians being my biggest complaint), but overall, I don't think it's 
any contest.

I agree that the old models in the trial version may well turn some 
people off by today's standards.
