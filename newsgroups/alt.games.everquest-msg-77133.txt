I've been in Warsliks since 24 soloing Forest Giants.  I've gone from 24 to
27 in about a week, but I don't get to play every day.  Steady XP and pretty
decent loot .... I get anywhere from 60 to 100 plat each time I bank.

The XP is starting to dry up a bit at 27 though ... I may be about to move
back to SK for Avocets for a littel while.
