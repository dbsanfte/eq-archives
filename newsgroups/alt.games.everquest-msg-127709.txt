Sorry buddy but most of us have lives and can't spend hours
and weeks at a time searching through thousands of NPCs saying things
like:

"What book?"
"What ancient book?"
"What lore ancient book?"
"Tell me about the book?"
"Where is the book?"
"Talk about the book you freakin' moron!!!!"

Tried that when I first started EQ and ended up with
nothing but frustration and headaches. Broken quests,
quests ending in No drop items that your class or race can't use,
or quest rewards that an orc pawn would turn his nose up at.

No thanks. Thank god for spoiler sites! I would have quit this
game after 1 month without them. Without those sites EQ would
have been dead a long time ago.
