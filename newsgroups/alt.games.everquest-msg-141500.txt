When I reached level 30, I put some training points into Specialize:
Alteration (I'm a Cleric.)

I watched it climb until it reached 50 and then stopped. Now I just read
that I have to train in the other areas too in order for it to grow beyond
30.

Is this true?

If so, when is the best time to train in the other areas to max out
Alteration ASAP?

Once I get Spec:Alteration maxed can I specialize in other areas too?
