Yes, the PoP jewelry is nice, but everybody and their brother is into 
jewelcraft.  My guild alone, which is not heavy on tradeskills (I'm the 
only baker and one of two brewers, we have no tailors or smiths, one 
potter) has *9* 250 jewelcrafters.

Unless you're getting the drops and combining 'em yourself, there's just 
too much competition to make Jewelcraft-for-hire worth it.  I haven't even 
recouped the 3k I spent getting jewelcraft to 250 in the 9 or so months 
I've had it there.
