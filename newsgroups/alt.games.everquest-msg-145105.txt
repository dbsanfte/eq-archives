I am a 47 iksar monk on rodcet nife.

Well, i've been hunting at the tunnel to grim forest from teneb mountains,
and it's starting to green out. I duo with a 44 druid, and quite like having
a zone at my back so i can scarper if need be. Does anyone know any other
zone which is good to hunt like this, or is there another region within the
mountains which is good for a duo like mine?

I've been playing with the dreadlands or emerald jungle? I've been told EJ
is basically loot free and DL loot seems undervalued now? Perhaps i should
kill kromriff, to get COV and dain faction up, to do the shawl quests? But
I'm told the quests the giants give monks are far superior.

I like to roleplay, and find the dain hard to like. However, they seem more
likable than their enemies.

I guess roleplaying in eq is pretty difficult, and am willing to side with
one then another if need be. All my equipment is bought rather than looted,
and it would be nice to be a part of these quests. I don't really know how
people manage the camps for their epics, tho; i mean, don't they have jobs?
Doesn't sitting for hours staring at the screen waiting for an_orange_banana
to spawn hurt your eyes, neck, back, and bottom? I'll never really
understand why VI thought that that would be a good idea. Oh well.

I am without a guild; maybe if i was in a guild that was raiding, i could
get CoV faction quickly? Any offers for membership? I have very very little
experience with raids and would like more, although  i am a casual player
and live in australia, and so am out of synch with a lot of the raids that
go on.
