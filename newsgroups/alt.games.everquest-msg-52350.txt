Exactly! :-p

Of course people are well within their rights to NOT ignore them and
continue to flame the (all too) occasional poster trying to sell an account
or an item or pp. My line of reasoning basically allows for people to post
whatever they want, if it is on topic (and sometimes off), not illegal, and
doesn't hurt anyone. My line of reasoning goes on to suggest that these
people be allowed to do so without being flamed. All flaming them does is
incite a back and forth war, which is really a waste of time, and in my
opinion makes those of us who (continue to) participate, you guessed it:
idiots!

But that is just my opinion. ;-)
