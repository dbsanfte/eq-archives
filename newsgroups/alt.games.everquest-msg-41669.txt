Don't be absurd.

Verant is well aware that *some* players are upset about this
decision. They've done it anyhow, because in their judgement it is the
appropriate course of action.

Oh? And what do you suspect is the *real* reason then? Just to piss
off some customers? Again, don't be absurd.

Like Ish, it appears that you're confusing past actions with current
and future actions. In the past they have been the BMOC, with no real
competition. Now competition is on the horizon, and Verant must alter
their situation. They may well still brag about their numbers (and why
not - they're impressive numbers), but it's Poor Form from a business
perspective to give away more information than you have to.
