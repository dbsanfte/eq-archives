You have 24h of online time to get to a corpse (includes time in the chat
server or anywhere once you are logged on be it another server, another
character or whatever), you have a week offline time to get it and one or
the other bites into the other at the appropriate ratio....so 7hrs offline
equals 1hr online.

Fast corpse recovery means going to soulbinder whenever you travel and at
least (the very least) getting those transit binds - this means if you
intend to run across Antonica stop in Rivervale, the side trip is worth
it. THere are a few other bind points...notable the gypsy camp in North
Karana....use them....stoppingfor 5-10 mins to bind is worth it to prevent
long corpse runs.

Also finding a cleric to res you will spin you back to your body....being
in a guild helps with this.

> Is there anyway faster way to travel between cities besides running ?

Yes there are 2 anyone can do, both require expansions, plus the
teleporting spells. If you are of the right class you can port yourself to
various places (gate is a one way port to your bind spot, other more
powerful porting spells exist) Such spells can be performed by approrpiate
people usually for a fee...on AB the standard ports cost about 10pp and
the channel taxi can beused to find a porter....certain locations command
higher fees. Some porters take pity on poor people and will port them for
free.

THe expansions that help are Luclin and PoP.....Luclin allows you to use
the spires to go up to the moon and then down again to a closer location.
Really only much use for going between continents in my mind...Freeport to
Qeynos is probably the most awkward place to do fast this way....PoP uses
a number of books around to port from place to place....its the fastest
system and the most convenient.

Weapons - OK 65pp is how mch the vendor sells it for....not how mch you
would get for it...fine steel sells to vendors for about 5pp. Vendors
prices do not reflect the EQ market, unless they are the ultimate soruce
for an item. Most items can be bought cheaper from players direct as you
pay more than the vendor would give, but still less than you would pay for
from a vendor. Also quite a few items are cheaper if the vendors sell them
(splitpaw kit was like that) but it never hit the vendors because you
could get more from players direct (supply demand in action).

Oh and finally when considering how good a weapon is it is not the damage
that counts...its the damage/delay ratio that tells you how good it is.
Divide the delay by the damage and the smaller the number the better it
is...this gets further twisted based on what you want (eg damage bonuses
due to level and type, whether you want aggro or not) to determine if you
want 1hs, 2hs o or high damage or low delay.

Ranger spell vendor (next to the trainer) in Luclin...if you havent done
the trader quest and got the necklace that goes with it you may have to
sneak behind the guy or get someone to buy it for you.
