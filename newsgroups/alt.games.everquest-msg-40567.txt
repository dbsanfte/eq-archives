IMHO your best route would be to take the shuttle from Oasis of Marr then
carefully approach the Ogre dock and either cast Invis and use the dock if the
boat is there or go around the rocks to your right until you can just see the
docks and wait for the boat there, you'll have to swim out to it. When the boat
reaches The Overthere it stops before it goes into the port. Jump off and swim
to shore then follow the coast East (away from the port). When you reach the
edge of the zone follow the land edge South (except for Sarnaks nothing will
attack you, despite what their con says. Though for peace of mind just cast
Invis) and enter the valley (opposite the giant statue), it will take you into
Warsliks Woods. Head due North until you reach the coast then follow the coast
due West until again you reach the edge of the zone.  Follow the edge South and
you'll soon enter the Field of Bone. Invis should keep your enchanter out of any
trouble. This is one of the ways your monk can use when he needs to travel to
the main land. HTH. :)
