Yep it was woth it. I know the turtle in Iceclad drops a better item but,
the AoL is kinda a rite of passage or symbol of determination (if you would
have asked me while I camped it I would have said  a symbol of insanity). I
still have uber guild clerics offer congrats when they inspect and see my
AoL.  Many have commented and one very nice lvl 60 gave my cleric a very
nice ring just because she said she knows how hard the camp was and that
anyone who was that determined should get more than just a back item out of
the deal, lol.
So yes the cleric wears the AoL proudly as he dared to sit and rot for days.
