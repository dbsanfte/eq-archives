People use it for two different meanings.

1. Powerleveling just playing for the sole purpose of leveling as fast
as you can. When a new server starts up you can see a bunch of people
powerleveling to get ahead of the curve and the crowds. It's just
plain old normal play with all attention focused on getting experience
as quickly and efficiently as possible, nothing else registers.

2. To be powerleveled is to have other people, or yourself on another
computer, help kill things for you while taking none of the experience
- ie a high level druid buffing and damage shielding and regrowthing
you so everything you kill gets obliterated in no time flat and you
are never in any danger. You go up levels REALLY fast doing this
(though some people are better at it than others, and some are too
dumb to know where to go and try to do it where there are crowds of
people).

Lots of people don't know the difference, and might assume one or the
other whenever the word is used, but now you know, and know how to
tell the difference.
