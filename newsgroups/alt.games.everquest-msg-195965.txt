I haven't played EQ for a while, not since the patch that caused
ZoneAlarm to lock up my system after I try to log-in. I've tried
Shift-Tab on different screens to access ZoneAlarm before it locks up my
system but have been unable to. As far as I can tell, the only way for
me to play EQ is to disable ZoneAlarm. Having had my system wrecked by a
worm some time before, I'm a little tentative. So is it safe to disable
ZoneAlarm to play EQ?
Thank you for your time.

Cheers Watchman :)
