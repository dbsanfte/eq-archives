Well, reading the instructions for the cooler at coolermaster.com, I 
deduced mine needed thermal paste because it *didn't* have the pink 
plastic cover at the bottom. I may have got it all wrong.

Still, if I manage to get all that gunk off, I think that getting a 
better cooler plus a system cooler may not be a bad idea.

I always thought all this fancy cooling stuff was for overclockers... >:-
