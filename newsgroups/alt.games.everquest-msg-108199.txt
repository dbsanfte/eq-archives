There are several factors at work here.

Simplest is the ratio: the higher the number you get by dividing damage by
delay the better.  Thus a 10/19 weapon would have a slightly higher ratio
than a 9/19 one.

But there are bonus's to consider, adding on to that base damage every swing.
As you level up, and as your str goes up, you'll do a little extra damage,
so that a  9/19 weapon may be significantly better than a 18/38 one despite
having the same ratio on the surface.

Another factor would be procs; that 9/19 weapon will have twice as many
chances to proc any effect it may have as the 18/38 weapon in the same
time span.

Yet another factor would be taunt; you get the attention of the mob you are
fighting based in part on how many times you swing at it, rather than how
much damage you are doing.  Without considering bonus, taunting, or other
actions, the 9/19 weapon will do twice as much taunting as the 18/38 weapon.

Here's the funny thing; it may be more important to -not- get the aggro than
to be able to do so.  Particularly if you aren't a "sponge" class (Warrior,
Shadowknight, Paladin) you'll often want someone else to be able to get and
keep the attention of the mobs.  This can be helped by taking a slow heavy
hitting weapon instead of a fast one which may do more damage per minute...
good rangers carry a pair of quick weapons for doing serious damage and
a big slow massive two hander for lesser taunt, even though the latter often
does less actual work.

The weapon I'm currently weilding has a 20/22 ratio, but don't let that get you
down... you'll probably do more damage with a 10/22 weapon than I do with
this on those rare occaisions when I'm FM and able to indulge my melee dreams.
