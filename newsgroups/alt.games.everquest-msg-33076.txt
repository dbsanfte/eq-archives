I'd guess this is Multi-quest, and that you can Multi-quest the J-Boots by
having the person who doesn't have the ring turn the last item in, whatever
that item may be, and they will get the boots.  Look up the quest and maybe
it will explain it.  I've never multi-quested, nor do I know much about the
J-Boots quest, so this is just a surmision.
