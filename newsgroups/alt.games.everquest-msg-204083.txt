No, unfortunately FV attracted a lot of players because of it's non-transfer
rule...Nothing to do with RP at all.
There are plenty of Dumb names (doesn't come close to Bristlebane tho) and
some OOC shouts but not that many, most ppl stay in character on open
channels and use the chat channels to talk /ooc.
There is a higher proportion of RP minded players on there but the server is
quiet compared to others so finding groups is often difficult...You end up
having to go to the Usual Suspect zones :ï¿½(

I kind of went there just to see what it was like...
I was often told I should play there. This wasn't by players or friends
looking out for my best interests but by the ppl who I refused to help on
account of their dumbass names (those that I bothered to explain to why) so
was normally something like "If you want to RP you should go to FV"
/sigh
Anyway I am enjoying my time there atm but the lack of groups has made
things a lot duller than I expected so I may head on back to Bristlebane,
some day.
