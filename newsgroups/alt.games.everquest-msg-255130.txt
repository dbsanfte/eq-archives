You are of course correct, and this whole issue is something I want to 
discuss as I'm only vaguely familiar with how it works.  But lets say 
for example that we are talking about weilding weapons at level 20-29, 
where there is no longer a damage cap  (or at least its a bloody big 
one) and yet there's no damage bonus yet.

With no bonus, comparing strictly ratio to ratio, for the purposes of 
damage production, is there any difference in DPS between a 40/40 and a 
20/20?

This is what I'm talking about, I see a LOT of posts in some of the web 
sites I've been looking at which use this "but with a haste" plan to 
minimize the effect of a slow weapon, and it seems silly to me, and 
further I'd like it stopped

/em waves a magic wand and everyone stops using the silly comparison
