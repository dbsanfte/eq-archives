Nevermind that there was an update posted in the forums at 1:30 PST
and another one at 2:40 PST. Okay, 1:10, but let's not nitpick over 10
minutes.

It's not like Blizzard never had lengthy downtimes during the WoW beta
and in the first week of launch, and it's certainly not unlikely to
think it won't happen again. Yeah, Blizzard's a better company than
SOE, IMO, but get your head out of their ass, eh?
