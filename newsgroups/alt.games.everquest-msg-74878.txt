My guild has figured out how to deal with this.  We have people that are
good at CR, they'll come back for your corpse.  :)  Amazing at how much
better we've gotten at moving as a group.

I have to say, there isn't a single other skill I would take *over* the
faster run speed as *any* class.  It is a tangible, noticeable effect,
unlike most of the other first-rank skills.

I will say that its appeal is much greater to monks and rogues for obvious
reasons, but moving at Jboots speed indoors...  well, my casters wear Jboots
outdoors for several reasons and most of those reasons don't disappear when
entering a dungeon.
