I'm sure its just a matter of taste, but I vastly prefer to divide 
damage/delay. That results in damage units over time units; which is 
'normal'.

I drive at 90km/h, I type at 90 words/min... etc... who says I drive 
0.011 hours per kilometer, or type at 0.66 seconds per word?? Nobody its 
always 'X over time'.

Similiarly... I do .404 damage per second (assuming delay=seconds which 
isn't true of course, but it'll suffice for now) makes far more sense to 
me than I do 2.47 seconds per damage.

(And then of course, you want to maximize damage per second, so picking 
higher values is the logical conclusion... clearly 0.4 damage per second 
is inferior to 0.5 damage per second...

2.5 seconds per damage vs 2 seconds per damage is the same information, 
but it strikes me as being less clear.

What is the derivation of the damage*2+1; ie why *2 and why +1, how was 
that determined?
