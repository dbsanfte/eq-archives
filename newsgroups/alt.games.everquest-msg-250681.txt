While I feel the same way, that most buff beggers coming up with the 
"for CR" stories are lying, there is still such a thing as a CR, and it 
can be challenging if you don't happen to have access to some high level 
alts or guild buddies who can come do them for you (or SC you over). 
Just because a lot of people now play lower levels in easy to enter 
places like PC, or in LDoN's where your body pops at the end of the 
timer, or in POP where there are graveyards, doesn't mean nobody is 
having to fight into Seb or any of the other dozens of "interesting" 
places to get their dead bodies.
