The traditional crowd control method is mezmerizing any adds.  If more than 
one mob is brought back to the group, then someone who can mezmerizes the 
additional mobs until the group is ready to kill them.  Enchanters, bards, 
and necromancers can all mez mobs to one degree or another.  If no mez 
class is available, then people use other methods, have another tank 
offtank an add, have someone who can root, root the adds away from the 
party.
