Well, the text you snipped made it sound like stun was the issue for
you.  As to "you cant FD because it will blow the pull", wouldn't that
be covered by having another member of your pull team ready to tag
when you FD?  I'll not claim expertise I don't have, just going by
what I've heard you and other pullers describe of their techniques,
but it sounds like it isn't so much that you'll die a whole lot more
as that you'll need a bigger pull team for some mobs.  That would make
it more a case of "harder to do" than "totally sucks", or am I missing
something important here?  (Not asking you to reveal trade secrets,
but I'm not seeing any trainwreck for Monks here.)
