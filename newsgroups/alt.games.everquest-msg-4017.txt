Nowhere near it, Biz. You are most definitely exaggerating. It's not
rare, but it's not frequent, either. Note I said "mildly" surprised.
As in not totally expected but not totally unexpected either.

Funny, all the recent server work that "just happened" to fall on
patch day I've seen has been a continuation of server work that was
already going on for the past week before the patch day...

This, however, is irrelevant to the emergency re-patches such as this
one.

No one said you did. I sure as FUCK hope you aren't implying that I
did. All I said is that the re-patches aren't so frequent that I plan
on them every patch day. Hell, I can remember SEVERAL patches in a row
going by without the servers being brought back down for emergency
fixes...
