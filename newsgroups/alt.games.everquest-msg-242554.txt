My druid 16 ran across an item with Burning Affliction II and picked
it up.  It's billed as adding 20% more damage to DoT spells.  But when
I look back through my logs, it sure doesn't live up to that figure.

I don't yet have any truly big DoTs, but I do have Stinging Swarm,
which does 13/tick.  (An aside: it's supposed to be 7 ticks at level 14
up to 9 ticks at level 18+, but I found it lasted 8 ticks at level 14
and went to 9 ticks when I hit 16.  What's up with that?)  My logs show
it doing the following damage:

	13hp (36.09%, 271 times)
	14hp (39.55%, 297 times)
	15hp (24.37%, 183 times)

That's nowhere near 20% extra; it comes out to around 6.8%.  Am I just
confused, or is something broken?

	-- Don.
