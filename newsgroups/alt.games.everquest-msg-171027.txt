I, as I am sure many of you do, sometimes get a little wrapped up in this
game (to say the least).  I think we all need ot step back and take a look
at our lives and realize it is just a game.  When there is no more EQ, we
will see what we have achived for all our effort, which will be nothing.
Family is MUCH more important, and we all need to remember that.
    I am sorry for your loss, Kevin, it must be hard, but I am glad that you
have reminded us of what is important.
    God bless you and your families, I hope you have a great Christmas and
new year.
