Well, you guys all seem to like it, and for $9.99 (whats that in pounds,
�7.99 ?) I think I'll try it. Hell, I spent �25 last night on beer, so I may
aswell get it.Thanks for all your input guys, and thanks to Al Vazquez, you
guys have convinced me. Now all i have to do is go out and buy the game.
Maybe I'll meet you online.

Hey, whats the chances of conquering the everquest world ???
