    You forgot the ending: they should take those lists, roll them into big
tubes of paper, and hit each other with them until they get a clue or until
they drop unconcious. I can just see the devs sitting around, talking about
Harmony:

"You know, it's a pain flagging every mob as being immune to Harmony in the
new expansion."
"Yeah, I hear you there. And what if you miss some? People might be able
to.... SINGLE-PULL somewhere!"
*room fills with muted gasps of horror*
"You know, if I flagged all mobs above a certain level as immune, I wouldn't
have to manually flag stuff in PoP."
"Make it so, Number One!"
*high-pitched man-giggles*

    So druids, how many places did you solo where you used Harmony to split
stuff off?
