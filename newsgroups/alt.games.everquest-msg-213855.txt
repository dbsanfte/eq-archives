I'd say yes, it was fun.  In a kind  of extended PoJ trial sorta way.
IMHO "Normal" adventures were a bit on the weak side (Think CT level
hardness and mob damage).  "Hard" adventures seemed to be more difficult,
500+ hitters and higher level. Heh, never managed to finish one of those
due to LDage etc.  Only thing that might be somewhat outta whack is
the /betabuff gearage was not in the least representative of what most of
my peers are geared out in and tuning for that could make things more difficult
for the non-geared people attempting them.
