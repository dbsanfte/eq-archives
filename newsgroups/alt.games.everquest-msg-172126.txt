As far as it goes, this is true.  But if you study the Bible you'll find
that God does not claim to be the "synthesis" or embodiment of the universe.
This allows for things to happen that are not a part of himself.  He does,
however, claim to have infinite sovereignty over every event in the
universe.  It's a fine distinction, but it allows Christians to claim that
God does not *cause* evil, he *allows* it for his own ineffable purposes.

It's similar to the story of Job, which goes as follows:

Job was the holiest man ever to worship God.  He had never wronged God,
never failed to accord him due worship, never done anything wrong or
immoral, followed God's law to the letter, and loved God with all his heart.
He was perfect as no other man had ever been or would ever be perfect.

Satan, the greatest of the fallen angels, was wandering and in his wandering
he came to Heaven and spoke with God.  God pointed out to Satan that he had
a worshipper who was completely out of Satan's reach, a man with whom there
was no wrong.  Satan then proposed a game.  It's not spoken of as a game in
the Bible, but that is what it was.  Satan asked God to let him hurt Job,
and claimed that he would be able to turn Job from God.  God, secure in his
worshipper, said go ahead but don't kill him (I'm skipping ahead a bit
here... there were stages to the game with fewer and fewer rules, but that
was the last step).  Satan destroyed Job financially, killed his children,
killed his wife, and gave him an intensely painful disease.

At this point Job cracked.  He began, not to curse God or to do anything
that might be considered evil, but quietly to rebuke God, pointing out that
he had wronged God in no way whatsoever, yet God gave Satan a free rein to
destroy him like this.  He argued that his service and perfection in his
worship of God was being rewarded in an extremely unfair way.  God's
response was to point out that he, God, created the universe, and didn't
need Job's help doing that, neither was Job even there at the time, so where
did Job get off thinking he, Job, a weak, pitiful little *man*, could
presume to judge God in his infinite sovereignty over the universe?  Job
mulls over this for a while, says Ok, God, I'll concede the point, and God
gives him back his wealth, a new wife, new kids, and restores his health.

Notice in the entire story God never actually *does* anything evil, he
simply lets Satan do it for him.

Now, I don't respect Job's role in this story very much, but, you know, I
suppose by this same reasoning you could say Hitler was a really nice guy.
I mean, when it came down to it, he didn't really ever personally persecute
and kill millions of Jews... his henchmen did it for him!  So he's ok!
Nothing wrong with good 'ol Hitler!

I don't dislike individual Christians... I know many who are great people
and who I love being around.  But I hate Christianity with a passion.  It is
a downright evil religion.  The Book of Job is one example out of many I
could give.

Even pagan religions whose gods slaughter and kill thousands of people admit
that the gods often do this out of personal evil tendencies.  Christianity,
on the other hand, worships a God who does things so horrifyingly cruel,
brutal, and twisted that any decent human being would consider those acts
utterly repulsive if done by another human... and this God claims to be the
incarnation of righteousness, love, and justice.  And they believe every
word of it.

I'm at work so I can't type more for now... but in anticipation of the
people who will post here saying, "Yeah, but that was the Old Testament!
God's a nice guy now!" -- Tonight I'll post the reasons God is just as evil
and twisted in the New as he was in the Old... it's simply a bit more
sugarcoated and less obvious.
