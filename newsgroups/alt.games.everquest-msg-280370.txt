Very true.  Having read a thread that postulated incomes in the
thousands generated by Hill Giants, I felt it was a bit exaggerated
based on personal recollection, and went back with a 55 Beastlord.  To
chew through them unstoppably, I had Virtue, KEI and a pet equipped
with pet toys.  Interestingly, for a Saturday afternoon (UK time) I
was the only person in the zone.

Slaughtering anythng that might be a placeholder and killing the
giants non-stop (no medding needed, actually) I made about 1k in two
hours.  (I stopped and left at this point as a couple of people
arrived with characters of a level who suited the zone) This justifies
the claim of several k plat per day, but that was in absolutely ideal
conditions, where I had every giant to myself.  I seriously doubt
anyone would get mega-rich there before they died of boredom or
couldn't get sufficient giants because of other farmers..

Agreed, but many farmers are just too scared to risk their asses to
get better loot.  Heh, I saw a 70 Necro and a 67 Warrior in there one
day, hunting as a pair - personally, I'd have been ashamed to be seen
"dumpster-diving" in that manner with characters that high in level
:D
