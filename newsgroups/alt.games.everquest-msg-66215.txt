Are you supposed to be getting all these video setting requests without Luclin
installed?  I've patched and logged in and played with my ATI Radeon 64mb DDR
card and never got any of those options?  Course I'm having some minor Video
bugs, but still never had the option to set settings.  Thought it was only in
Luclin.  Am I missing something?
