Not at all.  Just was suprised at how quickly they could confirm this, 
since they have to have tested all hell levels, and some of the non-hell 
levels to get it right.  I guess it's really only 8 levels that they would 
have to test, and the ShowEQ guys *do* know the levels of thier test mobs.  

Thank you for clarifying this.
