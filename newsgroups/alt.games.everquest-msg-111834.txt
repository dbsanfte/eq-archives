That's too much work for VI to program... without breaking anything. All I
want atm is the Vendors INSIDE a CITY can get money directly from your bank
if you don't have enough coins on you. This only works INSIDE a town so it
is only save you times from zoning to bank. After all you are in a city and
you have a bank account there.....

It wouldn't work with vendor outside town tho so you still have to bring
coins. Eg. Gyspy camps in NK/ Sro/ Oasis/ Lavastorm etc.
