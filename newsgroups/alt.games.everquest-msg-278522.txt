Of course there is.

Or to look at it another way, you're level 68, and you're sort of ok
heading towards 69 but you're in no rush, so you stick to say 70% aa and
30% xp.

You still earn AA at a reasonable rate, but every time you play you move
closer to level 69 and then reach it.

You might stop playing the game tomorrow, who knows how long it will last,
having goals is great, being binary about achieving them is one way to
play, but it's not the only way to play.

I play, I gain AA and Levels at a rate which keeps me interested in the
game without burning out, and every time I kill a mob it moves me closer to
both another AA and another level, and it works for me.

Your way is fine, but it really isn't the only way.
