Freeport east sewer (illusionary wall to the left when you face the
gate guards.. from the newb area) You follow the right side of that
passage, down and around  then hate straight into a room where some
npcs are including xelha. The sk trainer is through the door to your
right in that room, then through a door to your left. He is a human in
armor.

If your faction is not high enough to train yet, give xelha bone chips
in stacks of 4 (up to 4 stacks of 4) for faction pluses to dismal
rage. Besides raising faction this is ok experience in the lower
levels (might even be passable at 9 with enough bone chips.) The next
step up is spiderling silk and finally 4 beetle eyes. 


>Are ogres KOS in Paineel?  

Yes, they probably start out threaten like my dark elf cleric an sk
troll did. Like them though you will get to glower dubious quite fast
as and evil character (just a few kobold kills) It takes quite a few
more to get from dubious to apprehensive.


>How about Halas (I've seen barbs in Ogguk ...
>didn't know if the ogres and barbs had an exchange program)?  

Well, good characters can shop and such in ogguk and are probably only
kos to the guards who wander by default. The barbs you saw there may
have been killing guards, which oddly enough never lowers your faction
to the merchants right there. There also used to be an easy quest to
raise some ogre factions which is nerfed now.

An ogre though, especially an sk, is VERY kos in Halas ;)

Freep east, I now run every troll or ogre of mine there (and even dark
elf cleric) and get it bound (except shamans, no shaman trainer =/ )

Neriak is a ton harder to raise to a training point while freeport
east sewer is easy as heck for any race sk. As far as banking though,
you are stuck to neriak, shadow haven (if you have luclin) and paineel
once you raise faction to amiable to get the lift key (took my dark
elf cleric of inny WAY too long to do that.. )

Around 14 it is possible for an sk in ok gear to go to overthere and
solo pretty well until level 23 or so. At that point it greens out in
one zone area and the rest of the zone is quite red. My sk troll did
this from 14 - about 23, then it moved to the goblin caves in lake of
ill omen (still being bound in overthere zone.. hardly died anyway)

This would be a fun change for you having done the old world grind
before, though you don't say you have kunark/luclin. If you had luclin
you'd have a pretty ideal set up for Paineel even. See, the nexus in
luclin teleports you to the wizzy spire in tox which is near paineel.
So, before you had faction high enough in paineel you could train at
the sk area in Echo caverns, off of the shadow haven zone, and bank
and such there (in shadow haven.)

The way to get to the secret sk area is, from the southwest far corner
of shadow haven by the lil spires thing (which teleports to the nexus
zone and back) you go in that room to the north with no npcs through
that door. You know its the right one when you see a broken door
laying against opposite wall. You then go to your left through the
illusionary wall, continue on and zone. Once zoned, you go past the
two guards and to the right facing a big rock wall. Click on it some
and it opens. In there is an area with Sk trainers and spell vendors
and such.
