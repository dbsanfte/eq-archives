I understand this must be very frustrating. I've hunted in Black Burrow for
many levels and never experienced anything like this but i've heard the pathing
is weird in there and so perhaps the whole zone is prone to a bug or two.
As to your husbands disbelief at how much he pays for the game, I've heard
others using the "I 'pay' for this freaking game it should be the bollocks and
nothing less" I would say that 10 dollars a month is excellent value for money
consdiering the game you get. Maybe it is because im from the UK where we are
horribly over charged for everything but i consider 10 bucks a month very
reasonable.
Compare it to cable television:
The equivalent of over 70 dollars a month.
Telephone line rental:
Over 30 dollars a month.
A packet of ciggarettes over here costs the same as my EQ bill and im damn
happy its all based in the US because if verant had a UK server base us brits
would be paying probably more like 15 or 20 pounds a month.
