Archers are a pain, but are definatly not a dominant class.  they do
what they are intended to do, snipe away.  but as soon as a group
locates them, they are toast.    if they are high level they are going
to stomp on low level types, but thats the nature of the beast.  the
advantage is that in RvR, all you lose is some pride if you die.  well
that and the time it takes to get back from your bind spot if you
release.   As a minstrel, who at a low level can at least taxi the
high levels where they need to go, im a frequent target of snipers,
occasionally ill get one shotted. so be it.  but then those snipers
have to worry about the other sides sneaky guys as well.  

In the end archers do not win battles in RvR, they can be a big aid
but are clearly not dominant.

I just dont understand why leveling is seen as any more boring in daoc
as in EQ.  if anything it really seems the reverse, as in EQ it
becomes a pattern of endless camping, and hitting specified zones at
specified levels.

Realm imbalances appear often to better guilds being on one side,
especially early on when alot of the ubberguilds that came into the
game went to midguard, they had organization and probably the easiest
realm to play rvr well with all its area of effect spells ( Which is
why they migrated there), but with both sides have equivlent levels
and well run groups you dont see such major imbalances.  And such
problems as do come out, basically from the Midi area of effect
mezzes, which means you have to play smart if your going against them,
and that it is easier to play midi, are getting adjusted.

I agree that in huge keep battles the lag is bad.  and this is a
problem when you have over a hundred players active in a small area of
one server.  Cool as hell to watch though.   But if you leave a keep
defence to NPC guards, then the keep will fall.

Go ahead and try it now.  its well worth it, especially if you dont
agree that the tedium parts of eq equal skill or depth of game play.  

the one area that eq has done a good job on is the user interface, but
that is also after 3 years of building on and developing it.  if Daoc
lasts 3 years i fully expect its interface to be as refined and easy
to use as Eqs is today, actually since its not all that far behind
allready my money would be on DAOC.

Daoc had the cleanest roll out of any online game,  it has good depth
of game play, area and content equal to eq when it was first released,
a tighter and more coherent world story, not just various different
stories that you can get involved in that really has no effect upon
the world around you.  

ITs not for everyone.  the RVR is the best player v. player version
ever, that leaves the greifers with little impact upon the game, and
is a fun diversion from leveling.  ( its to bad that the UO folks
never found a way to limit the pkers to a more managable level without
just splitting the world).

I enjoy daoc far more than eq, it has less downtime as your leveling.
it lacks zoning in most places, which is part of why it seems to take
forever to get anywhere in eq.  its graphics are clearly superior to
even luclin.  and it implements player v. player in way that makes it
finally enjoyable, so that you can be involved in battles that are not
set peice affairs of yet another plain raid.
