>>By purposly posting this information, direct to a public newsgroup, it is
more indicitive of the postings of  a bored/spotty youth, who may have  a
grudge against the said player. And is hopeing said character will get
spammed with in game tells!. >>

That is exactly what this is!!!!!  Folks - this is a lot of crap!   This was a
friendship that went sour and there were some hurt feelings involved.  

 I am friends with  both "Reality" and Anomsuth.     Right now I would guess
Reality has a horrible sinking feeling in his stomach because he knows that his
two  closest friends know what he has done here and are really pissed at him.  

Again - Reality - by the time i get home tonight there better be a retraction
and an apology to this.  

I am so ashamed of you!
