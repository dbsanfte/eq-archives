Haven't heard any reports from Ledends customers on this.  Is this a good thing?

Haven't tried these areas out, nor heard of anyone who has.  Interesting to
anyone?

Did this work out?  They act like monks were underpowered up to this patch, but
we all know they were once far better at mitigating damage, and were nerfed into
little kittens; are they now somewhere in between?

I haven't noticed any difference.  I was quite scared when I read this, frankly,
bards for example rely absolutely on NPC's not anticipating where they are going
so that they can run circles around them to kill them.  Trying the same thing on
a PC you don't get nearly as consistant a result because the player changes his
tactics; if NPCs' refused to play along a bard would have a far more difficult
time killing anything, because chant kiting a mob to death takes time.
