Of course.

It's really not that difficult -- examine the ability icon
for a description of what it does.

Each ability has two functions:   it counters events (and
you use it to "whack-a-mole") and it advances either
progress or durability for a cost (which can be power,
the other factor -- progress for durability, durability
for progress -- or success chance.)

So, say you have a "Concentrate" ability.  You'd use
that whenever an event like "Distraction" occurs (i.e.,
someone bangs a door, whatever.)  But additional
concentration would also allow you to convert power
to progress, so you could use it for that.  (Or maybe
concentration means you're more careful, so it converts
power to durability...)

So, when you're running short of durability, you would
use a skill that increases durability.   If your durability is
fine, you're use something that increases progress.  And
so on.   Of course, you can also "stack" buffs -- such
as using one ability to convert power to progress and
another to convert progress to durability -- where the
combination is better than the single effect.  As it is
right now, up to three abilities can be in use at any
one time, in any combination.

The "skill" in "tradeskills" is figuring out which buffs do
what and for how much -- and then using them in the
manner (alone or in combinations) which allow you to
create the desired level of quality with the minimum
investment in time (including downtime regenerating
power.)   Add in that you have to take in account
the random events and it's an interesting activity (at
least until you have it figured out and are craking out
the 100th ink or whatever...)
