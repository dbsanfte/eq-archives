They were smacked down so hard simply because of what they accomplished.
Ever been feared and left unable to cast spells other that /quitting and
coming back? How about being grav fluxed once for 10k damage? Mob use
'exploits' all the time that are 'low priority' fixing. 

The difference between tactics and abusing bugs is, in a lot of cases, a
matter of semantics and one person's discretion. Without knowing *all*
the facts you can't say which side of the line they stood on. The GMs
obviously descided they were on the wrong side. You or I can't make the
same decision because we don't have access to all the facts

In essence, you are saying they were exploiting bugs because Verant says
they were. Whilst this is true (ToS state VI can ban you for whatever
they want without having to justify themselves) it is still perfectly
valid to discuss what did/didn't happen and what is a bug and what is a
tactic
