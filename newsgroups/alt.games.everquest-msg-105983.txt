Futile argument, since you two have not defined in here what 'best soloing'
means. If 'best' means 'Can kill whatever, even if exp is shite and theres
5 hours of downtime' then you're talking something different than 
'which class has the best exp soloing measured over 10 hours of soloing'.
You talk of two things, apples and oranges :)
