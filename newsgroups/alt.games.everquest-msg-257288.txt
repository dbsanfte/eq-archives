Group,

Has anyone here completed the Jeweled Skull quest?  It starts with
Yitpon in West Karana, supposedly at location 805, n14864.  There's a
Split Paw Assasin that you kill for a skull into which you put 2
rubies, 1 from Split Paw, and 1 from Innothule, that combine into the
Jeweled Skull.

Yitpon is said to be a rare spawn and I've sat there for about 3-4
hours with my Mage, so I figure that rare means you have to camp (and
pay attention) for days to get a spawn.  Is this assumption right?
Any information would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Julie
