Joe:  You think that was bad?  This is much, much worse!
Jim:  Why?
Joe:  Because it happened to me!!!!!

We all gotta pay the piper, folks.  But he plays his tune and you will still
dance.

The only uncertainty here is, who will cry the loudest?  The monks are
winning so far, with wizzie whining (my sentimental favorite) a distant
second.  Mages could really be said to have taken their lumps in stride, so
are unlikely to retain a place on the podium.  Pallies are disqualified
because their nerf didn't take.  Don't worry about that though.  Maybe they
deserved a "get out of jail free card" after the Thunder of Karana thing.
But here are the druids.  Monks beware, your position at the top of the
leaderboard is NOT secure.  Not by any stretch of the imagination.  This
contest is the druids' to lose.

All dark humor aside . . . or did I mean to say "bad humor" . . . these
people have not set out to ruin their cash cow.  They make the changes they
do because they think it will make the game better.  I'm sure I am wrong,
but I think they may be right.  Hmm, sounds a little like Yogi Berra.
