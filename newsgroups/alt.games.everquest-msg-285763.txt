Ok, so I played EQ several years ago and gave it up for a while, then
played EQ2 shortly after it came out, and have since given it up as
well. Lately I have missed playing a game in the evenings and am
thinking about getting back into it with a friend. The question...if 2
people are going to start up fresh and play together a lot. What would
you recommend the duo choose for race/class. I know that different
professions complement one another, but I'm looking for some opinions
as to which ones might be the most fun and keep us interested for a
while.

Thanks!
