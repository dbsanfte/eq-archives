This is autobiographical I presume?

Ok, as trolls it's not bad. It is certainly literate enough.

I almost felt I was there, though you forgot the tinny drone of a half dozen
laboring cooling fans rising to the fore as the music came to a halt, and

game, you know.)

But pretty good. Going for Reader's Digest?
