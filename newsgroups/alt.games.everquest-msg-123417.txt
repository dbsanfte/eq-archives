Magician or necromancer.  Magician has to have only malachite.  Necromancer
has to have only bone chips.  And in that state, they are both operating at
50% power or better.  Shamans, clerics and druids are similar, but tend to
be more dependant on gear to get enough mana to actually *finish* a fight. 
Magician and necromancer don't have any such problem.

For melee, monk wins hands down.  But I'd be unlikely to duel a naked
magician with a pet up while naked as a monk, so I'm gonna give the edge to
magicians.  :)
