PL-ing with DS not only screws defense but also offensive and weaponskills.
The buffs to give are based on dex hp and agi for meleetypes. (dex is
important cause pl-ed peeps are mostly already twinked causing lack in
weaponskill) For casterypes give them a mindbuff (kei) regen sow and skin
and learn them how to kite straight away to keep their castingskills up.

Ds should only be used against ubermobs in long fights where the maintank
will get plenty of times, for the rest don't use it to frequently.
