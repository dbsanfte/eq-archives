Well written, and well reasoned, mostly. The fact is, it's impossible to
balance a game for both casual players and powerplayers, and I think
that, on the whole, EQ is doing a good job of keeping both only
reasonably unhappy.

On the other hand, the argument that mobs get enhanced out of some sense
of hurt pride by the developer is just plain nonsense. Sorry, but it's a
fact of life that players get better, and so should mobs. Part of the
reason for EQs success is that it's so damn hard. AC is a MMORPG for
toddlers in comparison, and people aren't exactly flocking to it. That
probably means that Joe Blogg will suffer the consequences of not
getting there first, before the mob is made tougher, but unfortunately
that's a problem without a solution.
