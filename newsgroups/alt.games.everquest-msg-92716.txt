On my server its the tailoring one. Saw a guy selling tailoring for 2K, 
the rest for 500pp each.
Guess the market for them is kinda bad, have picked up a brewing one for 
2sp at a bazaar vendor. Think the serious tinkerers do them for skillup 
only, and if you get materials to make 20 brewing ones, you cant in any 
way sell those, so they go the vendor way.
Heard from the tinkerer that made mine that the JC one are easy to get 
materials for, she can easily farm them on her own as a warrior.
