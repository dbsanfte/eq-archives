 I live in the UK and have had the game for 2 days now.
My total play time has been 3 hours for me. As I write i'm still waiting for 
the servers to come back on-line, there is no mention on the website of when 
they will be back on.
This is piss poor considering the amount of servers they have, I will play 
the game (if I can) during this weekend and will make my jugements next week 
as to if I am going to carry on with the game.
BTW I play eve-online and that game only has 1 server ( I have seen 11500 
peeps online at the same time) and is down for 1 hour per day, they also 
keep you informed on the website of what is happening and when the servers 
will be back online.
Also my 1st impressions of the game is shite, it looks like a copy of NWN 
and that is 3 years old.
thx for reading my rant
