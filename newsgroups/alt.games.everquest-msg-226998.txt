Oh, heh, maybe I should have been clearer. I meant the "we're running
somewhere, camo drops, and the cleric stops and says 'camo gone'".  As a
ranger I always carry cloudy's on me, for exactly the reason you
specify...camo can drop in BAD places.  I also carry my own IVU potions.

And I suppose there *is* a lingering inhibition in me for taking folks who
cannot invis themselves to various places with me.  When I examine that, I
find that I don't mind the initial camo so much, it's the fear of
recasting in a bad spot, or even worse, them not noticing having that
"find a safe spot to recamo" instinct.
