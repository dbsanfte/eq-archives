Where did you get those numbers?!!?
So you are going to tell me, we had 100,000 peps in eq on one server.
And you are saying 50,000 where in bazaar.? LOL

Imagine if you will, 50,000 peps in a zone the size of bazaar.
Considering you'll crash trying to take 2 steps with half that number.

Sigh, For give them for they no not what they say...
