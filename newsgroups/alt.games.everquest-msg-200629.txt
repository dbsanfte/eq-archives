If you actually take the time to read what's been said in the various
threads on this topic here over the last few weeks you will realize
that that is a stupid thing to say.  Or, alternatively, you will still
fail to understand and thereby position yourself to prove that you are
too stupid to bother with.

Oh, and while you're at it you can try to understand this very basic
