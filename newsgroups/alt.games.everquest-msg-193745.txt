1) Learn to quote so that it's possible to tell the difference between
what you quote and what you type. (clue: if your newsreader doesn't
do this for you automatically it's begging to be replaced).
2) Next time you repeat the fourth grade pay attention when the topic
is reading comprehension.  Either that or stay off the crack-pipe for
a day or two and see if you can actually understand what I posted
there.
