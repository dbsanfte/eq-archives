Buy a port to surefall if you can afford it. (and if faction permits, since
you appear next to a druid trainer)
If you dont mind taking forever to get there, you could boat to butcher, run
to gfay, spire up to nexus, down to tox, through eruding, across eruds
crossing and voila! You might die in butcher, gfay or tox, but a few more
levels should solve that danger.
If you have some way of surviving a 100 point fall, you could swim to the
firepot room (in timorous deep) and port to erudin. Unfortunately there is
no pot for Qeynos.
