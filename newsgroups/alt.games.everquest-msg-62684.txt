Black tome is nice, was given that at lvl 6 or so, but at that level i
still need to tank with my pet and had some trouble fighting with the
book equiped, can't use any weapons, so i sold it :)

Personally i hated toxx, the paineel newbie area is okey with plenty
to kill, but god how boring the tiny area is, i for one like nektulos
forest, and having ultra vision is very nice :)
