Phew.  I thought I was the only one.  This has happened very rarely
for me.  I'd say once a week for the past three weeks this has
happened just as how you have described.  Since I play a bard and
swarm kite, I occasionally loot the corpses that are lying around
while the other mobs are beating on my pet.  Well, just the other day
in Dulak this happened and my Selo's dropped and I could not recast
it.  Luckily I have run 1 (working on 2 & 3) and I managed to get out
of the zone without getting hit even though I was being chased.

The only difference is that I do not have to camp to get it working. 
Zoning has helped me with the issue.
