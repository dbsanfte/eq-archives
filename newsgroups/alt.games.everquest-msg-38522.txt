Just saw the gamespot preview.  Verant should be VERY afraid for a lot of
reasons, not the least of which is the tremendous track record for bug-free
playability that Blizzard has built over the years.  Just looking at the
demo animation... The new look of SoL had better be a killer if Verant hopes
to stand a chance in hell of competing on that score.  WoW is DEFINITELY
going to be the "one to watch" in my not-so-humble opinion!
