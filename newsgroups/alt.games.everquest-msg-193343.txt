Bahh... lighten up, I was just being sarcastic. And I do multibox - up
to 4 chars at a time in many different configurations, but i will say
that having a tank that can hold aggro is VERY helpful in a
multi-boxing environment. One less keyboard to worry about and less
worries about who to heal (makes the button mashing alot easier).
