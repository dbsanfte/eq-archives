also, if you want to have a reputation of being a good, relatively serious,
dependable player, don't fall into the habit of using too many "d00d sp33k"
words like 'Noob'...  it really pisses off a lot of people - and it can make
them believe you to be an obnoxious immature player.

I'm not taking a 'dig' at you -I'm serious...
