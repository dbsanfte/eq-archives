Phah - I should be more specific.  This is a case where it looks like
you are wearing nothing is a slot, despite having clothes on.  I also
had a situation where the dye on my boots dissappeared (the dye slot
was black, it is now white).

Dying/Redying won't help fix the first case.  What fixed it for me was
when I died next, I changed my face (race actually - vah shir) and then
zoned in, looted my body and changed my race back.  Then all my clothes
were showing properly.
