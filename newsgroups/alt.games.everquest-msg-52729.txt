    Yup, although the mobs will NOT use them (they're No Drop, and poof
after the trade). It would be fun to see a mage epic pet using warrior epic
blades, wouldn't it? 8)

    Actually, this does nothing to exemplify your point about everlasting
items. This is entirely due to mudflation - the idea that to attract people
to the next area, the rewards have to be at least as good as in the older
areas or nobody will change areas. Even with item decay in full force,
people will keep farming the things they're using now (to replace them)
unless the new areas introduced into the game have better things. If
anything, in EQ today the rewards are planned before the risks are assigned.
And that's leading to poor design, as the "risk" of an encounter isn't
really known until the collective player base of EQ tackles the problem.
That's why we see non-stop meddling with mob strengths after release.

    It has been stated that the overall power level of characters (and one
has to assume they mean melee characters) won't go up in SoL. It'll be
interesting to see how the drops are, and if they aren't better than
existing melee drops will anyone go?
