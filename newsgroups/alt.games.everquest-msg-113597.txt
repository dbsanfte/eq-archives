Not too far from there.  New Hampshire, about an hour away.  Tell your
husband he's not missing much.  The traffic there is worse than ever, and
with "The Big Dig" it can take over an hour just to get the Hell out of the
city using the freeway!
However, it'll be worth the hassle to see them.

Soon to blow tax return on tickets,
Sean...
