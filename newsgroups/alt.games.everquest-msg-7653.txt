Eh eh eh...reread what I said please...don't want to get in a debate about
this all over again.

"Majority of American WWII pilots were methamphetamine junkies"

Yes...there was a type of methamphetamine that was distributed to soldiers
during WWII. Mostly the Japanese infantry, some British and even Americans.
It was NOT distributed to pilots. I mean think about it...you know what it
takes to fly a plane? You think pilots were going up drunk too? Yeah...let's
get loaded, jump into a plane and fly around with guns while high on crack.

ROFL...my grandfather was the CO of a Bomb Group in the Pacific during WWII
and was a Colonel during  theKorean War involved with the Strategic Air
Command. I'm very proud of him and his accomplishments and I'm not gonna let
some dickless wonder (Avenger) spew out untruths about America's hero's.
