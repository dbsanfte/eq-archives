Spend about 2 hours there last night with two groups pulling independantly.
3 shards dropped during that time.  I'm thinking get those shards now,
because that drop rate is probably crying for some nerfage.  I mean, 5 to 6
hours of one groups time to get four, assuming we didn't just get lucky.
What is Verant thinking?  In the meantime, I expect we will have a regular
presence there until all our clerics have 4 of them.
