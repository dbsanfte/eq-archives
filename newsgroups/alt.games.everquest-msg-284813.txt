Well, to be fair, organic in that context is generally short for
"organically grown", implying no chemical pesticides or something
like that.  And "quantum" actually comes from a meaning in physics
that's along the lines of "as small as possible, because you can't
subdivide it into smaller parts or steps".  Thus a particle can
have some amount of energy X1, or some larger amount X2, but there's
no way for it to have an amount between X1 and X2, even as it's
going from one state to the other.  Thus the "quantum leap" refers
to going between two states without any intermediate steps, and
this meaning has migrated from the very small back into the macro
world.
