So what happens after you are 40 something and finally can make enough money
to move out and get married, then you try to have children, but gosh darn it
you just can't seem to have any children?

What do you do then?

Steal someone elses kids?
Get some kids from Russia using your wealth and influence?

Obviously you should get clones, and have them raised by the government
while you go out and get wasted every night. That would be the most
efficient use of resources I would think.
