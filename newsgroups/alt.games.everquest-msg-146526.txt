I have an Iksar Shaman and for the longest time I thought wisdom was all
that matters.  And to an extent it does.  But also high AC and HP are very
important.  Why?  Because you are going to be casting DOT's, Heals, Buffs,
etc. during fights and you need to be able to absorb some damage when a mob
aggroes you.  Also, you will have more HP to cannibalize to get more mana.
You need to remember Shamans are not Druids and should not be equiped like
one.  Admittedly, every piece of clothing/jewelry I own is a +Wisdom item,
but most are +Sta, HP, or AC as well.  At 46 I have 1000 HP unbuffed, and
760 AC with a 200 wisdom.  This char is by no means a twink either, I have
over 40 days into him (and no I don't mean I started him 40 days ago, I mean
I have played online for 40 days worth of time.)  Getting from 1-40 was a
pain, but I have covered 40 to 46 in a short amount of time (2 weeks) and
have made some nice loot in the process (oowomp in TD is nice)
