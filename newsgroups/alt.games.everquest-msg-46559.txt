I read somewhere that water reeds are used in conjunction with a water
extractor and some kind of Lore item Water biscuit or some damn thing in
order to make a flask of water.  Problem is, you can only have one of the
Water biscuit thingies at a time (they are Lore), so trying to use the water
extractor in the field is a waste of time.  How often is your character so
desperate for water that it would justify carrying this thing around and
using up an inventory slot for a single flask of water?
