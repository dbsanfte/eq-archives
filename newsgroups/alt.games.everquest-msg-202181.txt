I would not recommend KK as a solo spot for many if any classes - certianly
not for a monk. I love the zone, but there are several issues to be reckoned
with. First, it's an underwater zone, so you need to deal with making sure
you have an EB item. Next, and again because it's asn underwater zone, you
need to deal with extra stamina issues. If you don't have a chanter or
Shammy to cast alacrity or something similar on you, you're going to get
tired within a couple minutes of zone in, and you'll slow way down.

Finally, on the XP, there are several level ranges where the XP is very good
in KK, but I would say that 54 is too high. I believe that Phinny is the top
mob there level was at 52, and he would own you. Most stuff is going to be
47-, and while the ZEM is not bad, you're dealing with add situations and
difficulties that as a soloer, are not going to pan out well enough for you
time/xp wise.
