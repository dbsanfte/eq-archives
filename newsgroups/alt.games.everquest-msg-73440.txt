If I were refering to that part, I would have quoted it.  I was
refering to the idea that someone speculating on the use of a
particular piece of equipment got cheated becuase the end up losing 7k
plat because the ended up not being able to use that piece of
equipment.  

If someone buys something, and then they can't use it and in that time
the price drops on it, they have NOT been cheated.  They're a victim
of economics, maybe, but they haven't been cheated.
