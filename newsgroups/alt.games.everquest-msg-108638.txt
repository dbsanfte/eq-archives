It *can* be deadly though, even in daylight hours.

My level 8 gnome mage zoned into Kith from WC at 9AM once and found
a "Teir'Dal Reaver" waiting there, one step inside the zone.  He made
some remark about Innorruk then stomped me flat with one 250pt punch.
No doubt he had just chased somebody to the line and I was just unlucky,
but ouch!

I've run through there hundreds of times before and since with much
better luck (daylight hours only), but I usually wait a bit before
entering to see if anyone comes out huffing an puffing, out of breath
and low on hp!  :-)
