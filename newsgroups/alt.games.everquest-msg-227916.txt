Heh.  Are you really going to sit there and say that selling loot to buy
items in the bazaar is the only way to keep your character from being naked
at 1 to 50?  You must be uber indeed to have gotten your start by killing
loot dropping mobs naked.  NERF MONKS!   (... er... again!)

If you're really all that interested, a shaman friend made banded armor for
me when I started the character.   Around the 20's or so, I believe I did
most of the crafted armor quests.  Various items dropped in experience
groups or were gifts from friends.  (You do know what a friend is, right?  I
don't have to explain the concept to you?)  Around 50'ish I started raiding.
Did the Hate armor, then partially the Thurgadin armor before HoT armor.
Around that time public raids really started to take off on E'ci, so I did
NToV and Luclin boss mobs with them until PoP came out.   A few months after
that I stopped playing my warrior.

Considering your credibility in this newsgroup, I'm sure you'll forgive me
if I just laugh at this, rather than being insulted or anything.   Sorry to
disappoint.
