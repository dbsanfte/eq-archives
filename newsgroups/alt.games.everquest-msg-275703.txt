I'm not sure what the earlier poster meant about DL.  I've been there
recently and it seems back to normal.  Prior to the event where Evil
overran FV, there were high level good and evil armies in DL, so you
had to watch out if you were KOS to one or both, plus the normal DL
mobs were missing.  And the first part of the FV event itself was the
war in DL, which was almost certainly a quick death for any but high
level players.  But no problems there now.
