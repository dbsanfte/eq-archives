Glad someone got something out of last night LOL.

Planned to do Cursed, then Emp as usual post patch, but SSra stubbornly
refused to spawn ANYTHING. The day before, we'd engaged Seru for the
first time ever, and after a couple of botched attempts, we killed him.
Lucky me, I got the best 'head on the wall' from any mob. Seru's
unequipable ubersword! So, still on a high from that fight, we decided
to head back and kill him again, as you do. Botched pull but recovered,
but warrior agro seems to be out the friggen window. Played Seru pinball
for 10 mins or so, and.... the zone crashed. ASGASFDHGASDFAGHDF!!!! When
the zone came up, Seru obviously wasn't there (/gofuk random timers) but
Cursed had spawned! So we went there!

So, we setup for cursed. Exiled and Glyphed died as usal with minimum
effort. We don't have MTs for them obviously, so assumed the agro
problems were just on Seru. How wrong we were. Cursed fancied a game of
pinball too. We pulled the plugs out and adapted and coped as best we
could, Numbers were stable, ressing as fast as we were dying (we're not
afraid to zerg occasionally hehe), reducing deaths and increasing in
numbers. Then...  THEN ZONE CRASHED!

Well apparently it crashed. I didn't see it myself, since I had suffered
Cursed's uber 1018 charm attack. 30 mins of being 1018 and chat gms just
telling me to petition ingame (erm... yeah... ok...), not holding out
any hope of a worldkick what with GMs being tied up with random crashes
and 8 chnnels in chat, so I gave up for the night.


Anyhow, thanks for the info on the new Sleepers. Seems to be pitched at
just about the right level. I just hope there aren't any overpowered
items in there that have a few people clamouring to go there (eg Velk
boots). Looks like we'll pop in there to see what's up, maybe follow a
few quests, but can't really see us going there regularly instead of VT.
Nice place to go for nToV level guilds though, and should relieve a
little of the stress between guilds at that level.
