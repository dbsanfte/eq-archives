Dodge is at 125 as I thought.  Parry, though, is at 165, which would be 
the cap for my level.  Should cap out permanently in 34, apparantly.

Double attack at 142, thats at least 17 points and probably 22 points 
behind my level cap.

Frenzy skill 132.  For a skill that is used almost constantly whenever 
fighting, this is pretty astounding to me.  27 or 32 points behind the 
cap for my level!

Bind Wounds 92.  This one I can blame myself for, though, I know its a 
good skill for melee to have but just couldn't be bothered to spend the 
cash on it at low levels.  I think I've doubled my skill in this just 
since hitting 30.  Oh well, at least I carry a backpack full of bandages 
now and make a point of using them all the time unless I'm chain pulling 
in a group with a healer.

Other oddities from checking my list:

Defense 154.  I MT a lot and solo a lot, I'm surprised to learn that I'm 
6 or 11 points shy of cap.

Offense 164.  Thats near cap for my level, and no wondering if cap is 
165 or 160.

Intimidate 110.  I stopped spending on this at 98, so I've started 
seeing skill ups at a reasonable rate, considering that much of my time 
these days I'm grouped and not practicing it.  I have to start 
targetting a party member and practicing it while not doing anything 
else... that is if I ever get in a group where I'm not the puller.   I 
could do it while pulling, but I'm very busy and I think it could 
backfire; you start it on a target but then it takes about 4 seconds to 
go off, and goes off on whatever target you happen to have selected at 
the end.  If I intimidate on the cleric, but then pull a mob back to the 
group, I could end up fearing it when I target it to start killing.

Kick 72.  Been plugging points into this for quite a while, stopped 
practicing it utterly since Frenzy is so much better.  Only reason I'm 
putting skill into it is the nagging suspicion that this skill is 
checked for intimidation.  I'd sure love a confirm or deny on that, I do 
have other uses for these bloody points!

Riposte 89.  Got this skill at level 30, put one point into it.  This 
means its gone up 59 points in two levels (plus a yellow into 32). 
Since it goes up only from being hit, and since my stats are the same 
when I'm being hit insofar as it raising as they are when my other 
skills that involve being hit... why are my defense and parry skills 
still low?  I'm only seeing 4 or 5 points in these per level, and what,
25 points per level in riposte?

Throwing is 118, although since mobs come hit or miss I don't really 
care about this skill at all, and have done nothing to try and raise it, 
other than use it incessantly to pull with.
