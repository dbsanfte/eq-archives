    At the end of the day, only one person is gonna be standing in front of
those mobs. If they can't boost themselves to make sure it's them, they can
always nerf you to make sure it isn't you.

    I think it's more a matter of there not being many Shadow Knights,
period. ;-)

    He still has the LDoN raids to defeat, and he has a long history of
going after any class that diminishes the role of his class. I don't agree
with him on most things, but on this I am sorta on his side.

    He doesn't need to increase his aggro to be picked by a group, or to be
the preferred tank on the raid. As long as nobody else is physically capable
of handling what a warrior can, the warrior gets the job. He's stated in the
past that he wants all raid boss mobs to be capable of single-rounding a
Defensive warrior. That implies that a paladin or shadow knight would be
turned to paste in seconds by the same mob.

    You're missing his point. He's not upset that a knight can get aggro
while Furor has trouble. He's upset that a knight can get aggro AND tank
what he just got aggro on. Under the Furor model, sure you could get aggro -
but you'd end up a stain on the floor in seconds if you did it. At best,
you'd be a stepping stone for a warrior - you get quick hate, warrior Taunts
off you and gets boosted that much higher on the hate list.

    If they are, it's a problem that has existed for years and gone
undiagnosed. A mid-50's caster today has access to maybe three mana regen
things that they did not during Kunark: Solstice earring, KEI, horses. All
other mana regen items, AA's, buffs etc. are rare enough that Joe Average
isn't going to have them. Solstice earring is negligible in terms of total
caster regen rate. Horses still seem to be fairly rare in the mid-50's
crowd, and they help with aggro (no sitting aggro) as well as hurt it with
increased DPS. KEI is the only real change to the mid-50's scene, and
warriors were considered balanced in the 50's (C2's original level was 54)
when grouped with casters with Clarity II (11/tick, versus KEI's 14/tick). I
see the problem as mostly being a very high 50's-60's problem, as that's
where new mana regen spells have been introduced (as well as spells with
increased DPS over Kunark spells) and that's where you start to see casters
with AA's and more advanced mana regen gear.
