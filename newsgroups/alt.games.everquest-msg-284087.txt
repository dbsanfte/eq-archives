That would be an interesting variation, and its not impossible that this

Using a non magic weapon, I'll NEVER kill a mob which is invulnerable to 
such weapons; a ghoul or will o wisp for example... or at my level, some 
mob in Unrest, I remember several that I was only wearing down because 
of my taps and dots and the DS I was wearing.  Now I can't be sure that 
if I can't hit the mobs, that my skill can go up at all... thats an 
interesting question.

Your idea of grinding on exp mobs, however, makes no sense to me at all; 
I mean, for the most part its all I can do to efficiently kill exp mobs 
using a real weapon; using one which my skill is extremely low in 
strikes me as a good way to run myself oom and perhaps shortly after, 
dead.  I'm not trying to get defense skill up, after all, so there's no 
need to bother with being hit while I'm hitting ineffectively.

I used a similar plan with my berserker and bard; snare mob, then switch 
to the crap weapons with the skill I want to raise and take my time 
finishing them off.  The idea of using mobs I can't even hit is just 
icing on the cake... but a crappy damage high speed weapon will usually 
keep a mob alive a pretty long time anyway... only trouble being that SK 
snares are also DOTs; small ones, but a nuisance when you're trying to 
keep the mob alive as long as possible.

For 2hb I can use the Abandoned Orc Shovel, which is 4/27 or so, for 
piercing there's a Fine Steel Dagger, 3/19, I'm not sure what high speed 
low damage 2hs and 1hb are out there but I can keep my eyes open.

IF on the other hand, you're right about damage potential rather than 
actual damage, then in many of the groups I'm in, I could practice 
anything with a decent weapon, because by and large my actual damage 
production isn't a big part of the group damage at all; if I can hold 
aggro using something with good damage ratio but no skill, then it won't 
be a big deal to get those skills up.
