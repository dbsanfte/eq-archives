Pulling and maintaining your skill. 'Nuf said.

Waste the time now when 1-4 hp is at least something, or later when it 
is just a time sink *and* robbing you of med time.

With the ability to bw while sitting now, it's not an issue, but back 
then it was.

Unless, being more expensive than a backpack, it was the only container 
you could afford, in which case it was always full of stuff, preventing 
you from crafting with it.

Simple solution -> be more careful. Nothing keeps you from accidentally 
selling that uber breastplate to a vendor either. ;)

Granted, ogres had it tough, trolls not nearly so, sharing their home 
city with dark elves. Still, that is something that needed attention at 
the race/class level, not in game design philosophy.

Aside from that, playing one of the most hated races in all of Norrath 
was *supposed* to offer challenges.

Like I said, ogres obviously had issues. That doesn't begin to explain 
or justify the complete removal of the travel aspect from the game.
