Egads... that was insulting?? Seeing as you are disagreeing with me, I 
placed you in the 2nd person. Your quite right, you might be playing the 
devil's advocate and not be representing yourself, but in that case my 
'people like you' would be people like the people your representing with 
the advocate... ... people who want to buy plat so that they don't have 
to spend time playing the game to get it. I have no idea if that is 
"you" or not, but in an effort to stay concise, I wrote about "you" 
instead of 'hypothetical parties who purchase plat...."

I regret that you took the 'you' as a personal 'you'.
