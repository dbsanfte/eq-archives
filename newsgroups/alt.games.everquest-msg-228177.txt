An honest man does not prey on others' mistakes.  He was not legally in the
wrong, but IMO he was morally in the wrong.

This is a reflection on *his* behavior, not on the character who did the
scam.  If he did this with a mule, who's to say he won't be doing other
unethical things with his guilded characters?

Even so, that character may not have been guilded, but the player is.  He's
risking your guild's reputation, all it takes is someone putting the two
together.

He should refund the money in full with an apology, and go on at least
probation with your guild.
