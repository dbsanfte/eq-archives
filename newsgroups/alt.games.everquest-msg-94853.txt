But... why?

It's pretty easy to level a Bard faster than you can keep
all five song skills up to par (and unlike a Warrior with
a neglected weapon-type skill, you *need* all five
song skills).

So your choices are:

1.  Limp along forever with bad skills.  Not really an option.

2.  Equip an instrument, fire up a song, and go afk for
    however long it takes.

3.  Equip an instrument, fire up a song, *don't* go afk,
    and sit there, doing nothing, staring at your Bard as it
    slowly raises the current instrument skill.
