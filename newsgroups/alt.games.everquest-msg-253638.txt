Keep in mind berserker was meant to take advantage of a new melee
combat system that was absolutely hated on Test to the point it was
removed (it forced melees to always be watching for "openings" to use
combat abilities). That made the class essentially stillborn, but they
let it go live anyways. Now you have a chain class dps character with
no real role other than that - like we needed another one of THOSE....
