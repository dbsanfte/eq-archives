	There still are such examples.

	The Peacekeeper Battlestaff quest, for example.

	One of the newbie quests you can get as an Erudite is the
Staff of the Peacekeepers quest.  This is a low-level quest that can
be completed by a first level character provided they can sneak past a
big shark in Erudin Harbor.  Once the quest is completed, the NPC
offers you a chance for greater glory:  Retrieve the Peacekeeper
Battlestaff.

	The quest was broken over two years ago when I started my
Erudite Magician.  It's still broken today.
