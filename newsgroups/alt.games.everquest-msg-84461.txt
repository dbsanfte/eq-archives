lol what you smoking?
For utility, id say snare, root, fire resist that stacks with almost
anything plus small DS, ports, tl's, evacs, succor.. wtf more do you want?

second best?  ports do not even compare 1 bit to wizard translocates.  TL
simply blows porting out the water

shortcut?  u mean the 15 min journey up, and 15 min journey back down to get
somewhere you could be ported to inside 2 minutes

err every time I do PoF, when i go to the grey, when I do chardok royals (or
chardok period), when I do sebilis AE groups, and my main isn't even a
wizard.

if your inexperienced at the higher end of the game fair enough, but talking
such wrong crap about wizards doesn't do you any favours

AoE groups involve chain stunning by the enchanter and cleric (or 2 chanters
as some ae groups have)
What does HP and AC matter when the mobs are all stunned?  Also, wizard epic
(amongst things such as mana regen) gives a self only Rune V (800 dmg
absorber)  and with constant ae stuns, it takes a lot to get past that
shield, let alone to die

Mages can do usful things? Like?   They have a pet, but they still revolve
around nuking (my first char was a mage also)
Druids primarily root and dot.. root and dot... root and dot... root and
dot.. seeing a repetitive pattern there?
