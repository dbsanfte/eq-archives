^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Three months ago I bought their other box set for my second account at that
same price that did not include ldon or gates.
why does it piss me off? the price on ldon/gates seperately didnt come down.
its still $20 each, at the very least, they should give a discount to the
people who are using keys from the last box set.


Flame all you want but this is how I feel.
