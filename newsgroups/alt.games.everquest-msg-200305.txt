Actually you have it ass-backwards.  I've abandoned my various melees
for the most part and been playing Druids lately. EQ is a social game,
designed from the ground up for groups and multiple groups.  Given
that, the fact that certain classes have been able to routinely (and
trivially!) out-xp groups by playing solo is a design flaw.  It needs
fixing, and I'm glad they're trying to fix it.  A substantial part of
my bitch about KEI is that it exacerbated an existing flaw in the
game.  Now if only they had done a better job of impeding botting...
