You'll pay at least 100pp for a stack of 10, which is the usual way they
come. 10pp per SOW you say??? Ya... that's the cheapest you'll see 'em
and often alot more than that.... Remember that the next time someone
complains that you shouldn't be charging 1pp for casting SOW on them and
should be giving it away for free... LOL.
