By an amazing coincidence, 11am EST is 8am PST.  Judging by the time he
posted his message, he still had 6 minutes to go on the estimated time.  If
you have trouble logging on, check out www.everquest.com, you will often
find that the reason is posted there under server status I believe.  Not
always though, sometimes, you just have to keep trying.
