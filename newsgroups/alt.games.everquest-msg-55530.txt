The problem with playing an enchanter is that you *really* have to
like to group. It's a very difficult class to solo, but in a
well-balanced group the enchanter can easily become the most important
member.

I had a lot of trouble getting into mine, as well. Like you, I prefer
the druid - it allows me to engage in my favorite form of play, which
is to mostly just ramble around and see what's going on.
