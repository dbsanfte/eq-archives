Please don't take this as a dig, jab, etc. because it's not, but I just
*have* to ask you:  You've been playing EQ for 21 months (almost two
years) and you've never gotten on of your five or six characters over
level 19?  How often do you play, roughly?  I only ask because I started
EQ just ten months ago and I got three characters to the mid twenties,
and my main to 50. Of course, I play quite a bit, too.
