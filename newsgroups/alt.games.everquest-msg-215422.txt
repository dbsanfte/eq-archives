Yep.  Undead *always* see through Ranger hide, mobs that see invis *always* see
through Ranger hide in my experience.  I've had to explain to people a good few
times over the years that yes I get hide but it's in no way shape or form as
good as Rogue hide.

Rogue: "Its ok, he doesn't see me.  Just invis past."
Me: "He sees through normal invis."
Rogue: "No, really, he's conning indifferent."
Me: "To you maybe, not to me.  Unsneak, unhide and I'll cast Camo on you."
Rogue: "Errr... ok."
Me: "There you go". /me casts Camo.
Rogue: "Bleh." *clicks Camo off*
