Trials 5 and 6 (tipt and vxed)

I disagree about paladins not being able to tank the trials.

In tipt (the tougher of the 2 trials, where you must kill 2 named mobs to
proceed) I've been doing a fair bit of adventuring in there.
Using a (botted) pali tank, we pretty easily killed (and subsequently
farmed) the first named, and using a "real" Paladin, we later completed the
whole trial on first run also (no deaths)

Not sure of exact hp/ac, but its in the criteria you specified above (over
10k and 2kac)

The trash isnt quite THAT tough, its more like 1k-1.2k, than 1400+... and
while it is a good challenge (fun too!), once you complete it once, it seems
to get incredibly easier.  Well, they say knowledge is power..

First run, we had the following group makeup-
Warrior, Monk, Monk, Cleric, Shaman, Ranger.  We had limited inf0z
(pre-warning of a trap spawning named mob half way through, but thats about
it) and successfully won, first attempt, in about 2 hours

The next run was
Paladin (previously won)
Cleric (previously won)
Cleric (poorly geared tov/ornate twink)
Monk (previously won)
Beastlord (new to it)
Necro (Previous failed attempts)

Knowing fully how it works now, and using invis to move past some early
trash, this time we were successful (first run) in little more than an hour.
Even with the huge dps loss on the second run, it was completed in a way
satisfactory time frame.

The second run lead me to change my mind, elemental gear as a minimum is not
necessary.. taking extra healing means a much lesser geared tank will work,
and still give a timely win.  8-9k hp + defensive and 2 of cleric/druid
means a much lesser progressed group can (not WILL) win.

CC is not required, 99% of mobs are seperated enough to be single pullable,
and you can always add a chanter+charmed pet to add some silly dps
