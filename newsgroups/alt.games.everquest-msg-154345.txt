Are there any areas similar to the karanas for level 35+ players?
The karanas are ideal kiting areas but most of the mobs there are no 
good now ive outgrown them.
I want a zone thats flat and has level 35+ mobs
So zones such as dreadlands, the overthere and frontier mountains are no 
good because of not being flat
