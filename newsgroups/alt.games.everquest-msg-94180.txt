Oh you definitely can. Happens from time to time when someone trains the
Cyclopes in OOT off their island and the person gates/dies. The Cyclopes go
wandering and occasionally "hit" a boat. At that time usually most people on
it get wacked for a few hits, which is enough to kill off anyone lower then,
say, 20.

Note that when the Cyclopes roam they go just about anywhere, from Sisters
to Brothers to Spectre/Gargoyle and even sometimes get back to their own
island ;)
