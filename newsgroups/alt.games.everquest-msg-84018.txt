I don't believe there is any trigger, provided you have done
all the steps in the quest up to that point.  It's a myth that
he spawns 30 mins (or whatever) after you talk to his brother.
(The quest was designed for dwarven warriors who have to travel
the long, slow road.)

I did this quest 10 or 12 times in 1999 with my druid, and
Faldor just seemed to spawn randomly, alternating with the
beggars.  There is no timer associated with this.  I ported
and gated and tested things, but nothing seemed to help
except patience.

The axe ain't that great a weapon, btw.  It's *heavy* and the
stat boosts aren't so hot.  I was getting about 250pp in those
early days, and I thought that was a joke.  Later on they went
for only 100pp, which was more realistic.  I've no idea what
they sell for these days.

Good luck, though!  ;-)
