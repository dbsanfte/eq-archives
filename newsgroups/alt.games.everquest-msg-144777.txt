Any Paladin or Sk that doesn't take a level of monk (in order to dual wield)
would be highly suspect.  Although I'd love FD, that would require me to
spend 17 levels to get, and the level 49 Paladin spells are kinda nice.
OTOH, it may be fun to pull a few levels of Bard.  Selo's, at least would be
good, maybe even Johnathan's Whistiling Warsong, then I'd have three
stackable forms of haste...
