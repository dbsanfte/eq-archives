FWIW: If I were starting on a new server the first character I would create
is an agnostic dark elf enchanter. After running them up to level 8 you can
pretty much do the Stein of Moggok quest only using only a few
spells/illusions. At 8 they also get enchant silver so silver rose +2 int
rings are easily doable.

Since you would probably have a fish killer SK it is a Band of Rodcet Nife
for every character that has the faction with the temple.

So w/o having a character over level 8 except what you get by faction
building the int casters Rodcet Nife faction, you can start with:
Two +3 int earrings from Cubert
+6 int
Band of Rodcet Nife 3 int 10 mana
+9 int +10 mana
Silver Rose Engagement Ring +2 int
+11 int +10 mana
Stein of Moggok +5 dex +10 int +25 sv disease +10 hps
+21 int +10 mana total plus some other perks like dex.

This much int and perks at level 8 is nothing to sneeze at. Unless you
completely blow character creation you can even have very viable human
casters.

I think the only illusion you need is minor, you just have to stand next to
the NPC before casting and dealing with them.

You need the alliance spell and certainly gate and invisibility would be
handy for travel since agnostic inkies are KOS to the clerics in RV<?>.
Maybe get illusion human too for general purposes.
