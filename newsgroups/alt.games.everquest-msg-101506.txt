I have a 55 rogue that helped a friend with his Soulfire quest a while back. 
Ever since then I have been KOS in WFP and EFP.  Lately, I have been wanting to
be liked in Freeport again. 

--I tried killing NFP guards, but killing 1 brought me from amiable to dubious
and still KOS to the other Freeports.  
--I was turning in orc picks to the guards at the tollbooth for a while, but I
didn't seem to be getting anywhere.  
--The new thing I am trying is killing orcs and gnolls in Highhold for scalps
and handing them in to the captains for faction.  After about 4 or 5 hours of
scalp hunting, I have turned in around 30 or so scalps and I am still KOS in
EFP and WFP.  

Does anyone know a good way to gain freeport militia faction?  Or is the scalp
quest the best way?
