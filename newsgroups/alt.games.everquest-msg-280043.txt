If they actually were crappy, it would strengthen the relative and perceived
power of CH.

You don't say "Lance Armstrong's competitors are crappy this year.  Thus,
we're predicting Lance Armstrong will suffer a humiliating defeat."

Look, current event analogies.  =)

My pocket cleric keeps CH loaded always, pious remedy, both because of the
speed and because of the casting distance, and pious elixir.  I don't use
pious light for exactly the reason you said, it's just too much mana for his
poor mana pool, but pious remedy is indispensable for those "damn, forgot I
was the healer" moments (yes, I have those even when 2-boxing...).
