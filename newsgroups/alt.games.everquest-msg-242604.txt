Look at your main chat window... Are you getting a message about the 
maximum number of traders having been reached? That gives, for some 
reason, the "under a stall" error.

If not, then try moving around, closer to the wall or something... 
Whether *you* think you are under a stall is irrelevant, the important 
thing is what the server thinks.
