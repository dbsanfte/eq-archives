There is no doubt that in a world the size of EQ, some mechanism must be
in place to make travel less cumbersome at some point.

The PoK was not the right solution.  The PoK was "an H bomb to kill an
ant" solution.  It is however the perfect solution for the power gamers
which seems to be SOE's primary target audience these days.

Let me tell you, I feel certain SOE will eventually (hopefully not too
late) recognize that non-power-gamers make up a big part of their
customer base as well!  I could be wrong about that though...

Some kind of travel compromise could have been made that didn't completely
trivialize travel to so many places...  maybe something like Diablo 2 where
you had to walk to your destination at least once first, or maybe players
having to do a quest before teleportation is enabled for them from point A
to point B.  I don't know...  but *something* other than "here's a zone
that trivializes everything".
