It does.

Also correct, high skill just allows you to get hidden on the first try.
Skill level on hide might influence evade success in combat, but I don't
remember it ever being proven to do so.

You should probably still mention the AA.   So that they know this isn't
something you get from skill in sneak / hide or just leveling.

Also, some things can see through SoS, but they were much rarer.  And you got
a red message when you con'ed them indiciating that.  "You sense that this
being can see you!"

It's a level thing.   When Kunark came out, that was one of the improvements
to rogues.   Each level above 50, they get a slight increase to movement speed
while sneaking.   At level 60 you sneak at full running speed.

Permanently reduces aggro by a set / random amount, exactly like Jolt.  (Can
never remove you from the hate list though, is what he's getting at.)

72 minutes to begin with, I think.   Like the other escape abilities, you can
buy AA's to reduce the timer, but it never gets low.


Sorry if my info is a bit out of date anywehere.   I haven't played EQ since
OOW days.    Just happened to be passing through and wanted to respond.   My
rogue was 65 or 70 when I quit, I forget which.
