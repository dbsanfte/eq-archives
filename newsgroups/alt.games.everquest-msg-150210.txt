He DOES despawn fairly quickly...assuming he's never aggroed, if he is, the
timer starts again.

Why the hell were the casters bound so close to Faydedar?

We don't use tunnel either...gets too close in there. :p  Like I think Jazz
mentioned, we're way down the beach as well.  I think you still get messages
(fear mostly) though they don't seem to stick or anything.

MT also starts the fight as the only one sitting down.
