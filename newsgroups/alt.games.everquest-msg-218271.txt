Easiest way is to try and split them before they make it to camp.
Either root one on incoming or just slow one on the way in. Even if
it's resisted, you'll have one mob split off from the group. 

If they're in a bunch in the camp, I just pick one at random to slow
asap. Assuming the rest of the group is using assist, you'll either
have just slowed the one everyone else is on, in which case odds are
that it stays on your MT or you picked one that hasn't been hit in
which case he'll come after you and you can park it and then slow the
next. 

I usually just circle around the mobs if I need to try and pick a
particular target but some people like to use top-down view. I find
that too confusing since the times I need to use it I'm also usually
moving and root parking which I can't do well in any 3rd person view.
