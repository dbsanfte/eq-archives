I got a voicemail at work yesterday from a friends brother asking me
to
call him ASAP. When I did i found out my best friend lost a battle
with
leukemia yesterday. I am 36 and we have been friends since 4th grade.
He
was diagnosed exactly a year ago and the doctors told him that he had
like
2 to 5 years to expect IF it doesnt go into remission. When children
get
leukemia the remission rate is high but when adults get it, its like a
death
sentence worse than AIDS. He left a wife and 4 kids, the youngest 3
and the oldest 11. I never could get him into Eq because he was self
employed and
always practical with his money (hence....subscription to a game is
out).
Leukemia is some bad shit. Do whatever you can to help out.
Here is a link for people to donate to leukemia research with paypal.
