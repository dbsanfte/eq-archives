Well, the lack of cust service skills was evident last night.  I had
petitioned for the surname Coeurd'Aigle and ended up in the following
conversation with GM Solania:

[Thu Nov 01 21:02:31 2001] Solania tells you, 'GM Solania here, Im afraid
that I cannot issue the surname of Coeurd'Aigle. However I can give you
Steelheart if you'd like'
[Thu Nov 01 21:03:11 2001] You told Solania, 'Why not?  I have it for
another char. '
[Thu Nov 01 21:03:45 2001] Solania tells you, 'Im sorry, but that surname is
against the naming policy '
[Thu Nov 01 21:04:26 2001] You told Solania, 'It wasn't when the last GM
gave it to me.  It's Eagleheart in French.'
[Thu Nov 01 21:04:50 2001] Solania tells you, 'Im sorry, but I cannot give
you that lastname. Please petition when you think of a surname that doesnt
violate the naming policy'
[Thu Nov 01 21:05:11 2001] You told Solania, 'Can you explain why it is
against policy?'
[Thu Nov 01 21:05:24 2001] You told Solania, 'I really don't understand'
[Thu Nov 01 21:05:50 2001] Solania tells you, 'Please go read the naming
policy at www everquest com'
[Thu Nov 01 21:06:44 2001] You told Solania, 'I believe that it says one
special char ' and no titles.  Also, no names from popular lit.  Anything I
am missing?'
[Thu Nov 01 21:07:22 2001] Solania tells you, 'Please log out and read the
naming policy at www everquest com and petition for a surname'

Now, I am in a management role with my company and if I ever responded with
"Go read company policy" and refused to explain, I would have some very
disgruntled employees.  I believe I was polite (We were fighting Sarnaks at
the time and my poor 22nd Shaman was getting smacked around) and I asked for
a reason.  3 times I was told to go read the rules, never an explanation.
Now, the kicker, I have 3 other chars with that same last name already,
given by 3 other GMs.

Does anyone see anything that would make this against policy?  Should I just
wait for another GM?  Is there anyone that I can appeal to, I am trying to
use the same last name for all my chars.
