My god this is exactly what I hope has NOT happened.

However this analogy may be all too true, rampage over several zones,
killing random innocents. Not what we need.

At the moment, here in the UK I am far more worried about the posibility
of US overreaction than further terrorist attacks.

This is an awful thing that has happened, but if the US goverment /
armed forces are thinking on the same lines as some of the posts I have
seen here then god help us all. 

A gut reaction of punitive action right now could start world war 3.
This is something that I really don't want to see.

I'm going home now to pray that the USA government is more controled and
sensible than I ever thought they were, because if they are not then we
are all in trouble.

I hope that there are no more atrocities and that any action is take
after *much* thought.

Jim
