At level 60, bards get the 25% haste that breaks the haste cap.  They do
have other haste songs that don't stack with spell haste, nor do they break
the haste cap.  So, given a bard of sufficient level in the group, would you
rather have the bard raise the melee to a haste of 100%, or have the bard
plus the shaman raise the melee haste to 115% or 125% (depending on the
level of the bard)?  While his numbers may have been off, it still does not
change what the best haste combo is here.

Not to mention that I often find myself in a group with neither an enchanter
or a bard.

At level 62, bards get a 60% haste song that does not stack with spell
haste.  Prior to that, 45% nonstacking haste looks like the highest.  If you
want to stack it, then 25% at level 60 is the best.  Prior to level 60, it
is 15% if you want it to stack.
