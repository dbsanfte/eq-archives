On one hand you talk about not wanting the shaman buffs, which overwrite 
some of yours, then, next you say that you are only talking about BL only 
vs SHM only buffs.

Fo7/Boar/Diaku gives you 149 more HP, same Dex, 70 more STR, and 25 less 
Stamina than your four buff combo in three buffs, and still stacks with 
SV.

So, get the best of both worlds, Fo7/Boar/Diaku/SV.

Fo7/Diaku/Boar gives 544hp, 105dex, 120str, and 60 stamina, and stacks 
with SV.

Earlier you had mentioned melee running when the shaman MGBs Fo7 for a 
raid, so, that obviously is not talking about strictly shaman vs BL 
buffs, but rather what is the best lineup for raid buffs.

I will certainly concede that BL only buffs vs Shaman only buffs you can 
get more HP.

If you really want your DEX maxxed, I can boost dex by 290.
