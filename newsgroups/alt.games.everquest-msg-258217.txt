So I've -still- neglected my 2hp and 2hb skills, at 53.  Looking at a 
list of "best weapons" for BER use at 65 with 40% haste, it looks like 
they are distributed across all three styles, so I really ought to catch up.

But I can't bring myself to inflict my abyssmal skills on my buddies 
while exping, either.

I'm too lazy to swap in the "wrong" weapon once the mob runs while 
soloing, and soloing is generally a  battle between my regen rate and my 
kill rate; slowing down by swapping in a poor skill weapons (even if 
ratio is the same) isn't going to help that situation much.

But there are mobs who hit light enough that I don't lose hp, on 
average, at all, and can afford to hit worse than normal.

For example, there's an erudite SK just outside the Warrens, isn't KOS 
to me but will fight if provoced; he HT's and then starts meleeing, 
hitting for between 16 and 19 points per blow, some double attack.

Unslowed, if I run my clicky regen, I actually make back the blue worth 
of damage from the HT before he's dead.

Here's my problem though: he's dead.  I'm using a 18/35 1hb, he dies 
pretty quick.  Using a 7/30 one he lives a bit longer

SO I'm wondering if there isn't a relatively high speed very low damage 
weapon that might keep him alive indefintely; I'd need one for 2hp and 
one for 2hb.  Defensive skills going up nicely, mob that is encouraged 
to beat on me as long as he can manage it is friendly to such skill gains
