Everquest is no faster on a cable modem then a modem, continous data but not
large amounts.  A cable modem means no or few "link deads" due to the
connection.  If you want to share the modem on two accounts, you'll need a
router, or to use one of your machines as a router with ICS or something
similar.  Problem is that Everquest doesn't like to let other software run,
so I'd go for a hardware router. A few have serial ports to support modems.
It may be possible for you to use one of these on your one way but I'm make
sure in advance.

Here's some info.
