The mages -- and various other NPCs in Twilight Sea -- give the
quests for the Twilight line of armor.   I'd really doubt they're KoS
to anyone by default.   In all my times through there, I don't
remember seeing a single corpse that couldn't be attributed
to someone aggroing another mob in the zone and running to
the guards for help.   (And it doesn't look like they help;  in fact,
they may not care much for you killing the elementals...)  One
thing for sure is that they do NOT follow Katta faction:  people
who are default KoS to Katta travel through there all the time.

The best way to find the teleporter in Fungus Grove is to invis
in the tunnel right outside the outpost, then follow the left wall
until you see a hill with a bridge on it in the center of the tunnel.
Leaving the wall and running out to that hill and across the
bridge leads you to a cavern with a large ring in it.   Clicking on
the ring teleports you to Twilight Sea.   (And vice-versa on the
other side, too.)
