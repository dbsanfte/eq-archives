    Hmm. Necromancers and Mages feed mana - tons and TONS of mana - to
classes like clerics and wizards that are vital to success. I wouldn't put
them below a druid in the raiding totem pole - we've called off raids
because no mages were online.

    The two classes I'd put below druids are shadow knights and beastlords.
Beastlords are a one-buff class that doesn't offer much beyond that one buff
(lowish damage, no real tanking ability, no useful spells/buffs other than
Savagery). Shadow Knights have low damage and weak spells with no area of
specialization that another class can't do better. And they're worse
offtanks than paladins and warriors. Harm Touch is a parlour trick - if the
damage output was important, you'd take along a warrior or monk instead and
get the damage differential.
