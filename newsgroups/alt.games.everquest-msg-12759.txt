I must admit, I find it odd as well. If you hadn't brought it up, I probably
would not have said anything, knowing the general feeling here against using
"plz" and "thx".

I can imagine in 20 yrs, that the people who use this sort of jargon, will
be railing against some form of language that teenagers, as yet unborn, will
be using. It may well be that these abbreviations will become accepted usage
in a few years.

Someone said in this thread that not typing out the whole word shows a lack
of respect for the person they are talking to, or that it shows the laziness
of the person who is doing the typing. Someone else pointed out that "n e 1"
is only 1 keystroke less than typing "anyone", so I don't think it has
anything to do with laziness in typing. I think that those people just like
to use those "spellings". Neither do I think that it is showing a lack of
respect for the person you are addressing. Clearly, not everyone thinks they
are not getting respect, otherwise the usage of "plz" would most likely
cease, at least when asking for buffs.

I think it is just that we do not like the way some people speak. We all use
some abbreviations and jargon that we do feel comfortable with. Personally,
I used to hate reading text that was full of spelling and grammar errors.
Some phrases used to grate with me... eg "could care less" instead of "could
not care less", things like "hehe", or "lol". They don't seem to bother me
at all now.

I think it is just the language evolving, and not granting SoW or refusing
to buff, is not going to stop it.
