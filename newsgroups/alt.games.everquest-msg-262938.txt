My berserker almost always runs Fungal Regrowth, which is a regen with 
snare (no slow), I'm very much used to running around at snared speed.

Of course, I can (and do) just click that off whenever I feel the need 
for speed, boosting up to SOW or Run 1 speed at will; as the FR is an 
insta click I can get back whenever I want it without any consideration 
for cast time or mana regen.

Can you even click torpor off if you want to?  I forget, its been a 
while since I was playing my shaman (who of course only had Stoicism anyway)

The slow would be a bit more annoying, because I have no taunt, so I'm 
relying on damage in addition to stuns to hold aggro.
