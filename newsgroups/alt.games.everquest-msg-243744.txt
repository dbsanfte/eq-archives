I hear you.  There's been a lot of talk lately about the pros and cons of 
opening up the other character slots for FV, but (imo) it would be a disaster 
*unless* they got rid of the special no-nodrop rule as well.  Some people say 
they like the one character rule because reputation means more, but 
considering how easy it is to reroll... eh.

The lack of nodrop on FV, combined with the whole plat farming/buying plat 
issue, has brought a lot, has attracted a lot of people who are there *just* 
for the loot, for the stuff that can be bought there that can't be bought on 
other servers (since on any other server it'd be nodrop).

I'd be quite happy, personally, if FV became just like any other server 
(normal nodrop rules, 8 slots, etc) and was differentiated soley by the 
"roleplaying perferred" label.  I could recreate my Cazic Thule characters to 
join my current FV main.
