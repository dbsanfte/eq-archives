One interesting way to turn the tables there is to have invisible
creatures moving around in the undergrowth - you can notice them by
the movement of the grassq.  Not that I think they'll do that, since
it would disadvantage people with low-end graphics card, but maybe in
a game with higher requirements in the future...  In practice I never
found this (not seeing aggresive creatures through the grass) to be a
problem during my 16 levels in beta, but then that's a very very small
part of the game.

You don't need to get closer to see what it is, though, just use your
handy autotarget button, which doesn't consider grass an obstacle.
That is, of course, immersion-breaking to some, at least.
