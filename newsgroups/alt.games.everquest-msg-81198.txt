I would advize against buying any of the debuff spells besides slow.  

Many tests have been run, and mob damage output/input was shown to be
largely unaffected by debuffing them.  STR debuffs are good in PVP for
encumbering your opponent, but not noticeable enough in PVE to justify
the large mana cost.  You're better off using that mana for one more
nuke.

The exception is slow (which is a must-have at level 35 and higher)
and Cripple (but cripple only on mobs that flurry) in some raid
encounters.


Also, Strength buffs on pets have never seemed to help with their
damage output.  The enchanter STR buff is so minimal it can be
discarded early on, I'd say.  Don't recall using it after level 10.




Just my opinion of playing an enchanter to 60. Much of it influenced
from way too many hours reading message boards at work.  As with all
things in life, best to try these things out for yourself.
