No, I also like the Iksar looks. I didin't exactly want regen with the exp
hit I pay for, but that's not something I can change. Oh, and you might
have noticed that I was talking about *lowering* the exp hit, because
Iksar obviously don't have a huge vision benefit anymore. I said
nothing about eliminating it, since there's still regen (and the
ridiculous 100 skill in swimming).
