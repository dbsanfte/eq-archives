Uh, since when?

As far as I know, melee has always broken root.   Even just the other day, I
was duoing with a shaman and we were trying to use root so he could hold
aggro.  Between quad normal attacks and double backstabs, the root was
lasting an average of about 3 seconds.   He basicly had to chain it to get
it to work.
