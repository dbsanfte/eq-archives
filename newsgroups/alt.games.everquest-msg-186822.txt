Actually, if it is truly blatant idiocy, then any reply at all is giving the
poster more respect than is deserved.  If a bad post would damage another,
then a correction should be posted for the benefit of others.  Differences
of opinion where there isn't really a lack of respect can be discussed
without stooping to childish behavior.  That does not seem to always be the
norm here.  I can only hope that the most blatant offenders are not adults,
though I personally know a number of children with more maturity than some
of the adults I've had discourse with in the usegroups.

Cheers,
Eric
