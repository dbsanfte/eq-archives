Cleric, eh?  Don't worry.  They will most likely let you tag along at 28.  Or heck,
maybe even 26.  Clerics are  funny that way.  I was in Nro once with my first cleric
on Drinal.  I was level 12.  A group was hollering for members 15-18 to go to Oasis. 
I ignored them, of course, and shouted out my class, level, and looking for a group,
hoping a derv group would bite.  The leader sent me a tell 3 seconds later, asking me
to join.  I pointed out the difference in mine and their preferred levels.  "I'm not
15 yet!  Not even close!" 
     "You will be later tonight," he said.  And he was right.
