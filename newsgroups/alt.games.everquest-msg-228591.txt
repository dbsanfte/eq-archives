They should make the new zones planes, and make it so that to enable
leveling past 65, you have to defeat a certain mob.  When that mob dies, his
last act is to put a curse on you that makes it so you can't get too far
from planes ever again.  You can from then on only go to the new zones, PoP
zones, the Nexus, and the Bazaar.
