They had practically no reason to go there for personal gain in the
first place. The shaman's personal gain from going is same as always:
Kill a couple of golems, kill MotG and hope he has PA. Post awakening,
it's actually easier on chanters and clerics. You don't need an army of
seiving chanters to keep mobs from gating, and you don't need more than
a couple of clerics doing normal battle healing. Warders had very little
for non-melees that isn't better and/or more easily accessible
elsewhere, and waking the warders reduced the reliance on large numbers
of support classes to get primals.

Agreed the zone is ruined as a primary raid target. Agreed primal intake
is reduced from maybe 3-4 useable primals to the primary ST-focussed
guild for one evening's work. 

But look at it from a different angle. For everyone else, primals are
actually MORE accessible, since it's now a 3 day repop and smaller
numbers needed to get a chance of 1 or 2 primals. Smaller guilds
would've had to get 50 keys and wait until the primary guild finished
their run of weekly ST campouts. Then the next in line guild steps up
and focuses on ST one day a week, for the fastest way of getting
everyone primals. Post-awakening, a smaller guild can get 30 keys, and
have a much greater chance of finding warders up, maybe get a PA scroll,
maybe get some 2h which would've rotted on the primary guild's raids,
maybe get some 1handers they would've had zero chance in killing the
warders for.

It's harder for one guild to equip everyone by holding a monopoly on ST,
but more guilds have access to at least some primal. Bad news for the
second tier guilds, good news for the 3rd and 4th tier guilds.

The myth no-one will ever get primal again, is totally false, and
propagated by the runner-up guilds who can't monopolise the zone for
months to get everyone and their dog equipped in the same way the
primary guilds did.
