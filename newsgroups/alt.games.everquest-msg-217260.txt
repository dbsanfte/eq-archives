For the Iksar at least...

Hum.

I play with the Luclin models because I am a slave to graphics and high 
polygons, but OH how I miss how Iksar used to look, and the way they used 
to sit and swim.  Not to mention the fact that there's some kind of 
modelling bug... when female Iksar sit, one leg is higher than the other in 
a really unnatural way.  :P

Oh, yeah, and for some reason when I have the Iksar Luclin models on, all 
the NPC female Iksar models that use the OLD version are screwy texture-
wise.  They look raw and don't have eyes.  Creeeeepy.  Have deleted .txc 
files a couple of times to try to get a fix, no go.  No help from customer 
service neither.

Hm.  I wouldn't mind if they made it so certain models, when running, 
didn't look like they had something long and wooden up their behinds, 
either...
