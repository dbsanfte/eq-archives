I'm looking for a dependable, reusable source of money. I have an Enchanter
for the purposes of Jewelry making, but nobody buys my jewelry, thus making
it very hard to invest in the higher quality metals/gems. I have a Shaman,
my main, and thought he could 'buff for donations.' This doesn't work
because whenever I'm in PoK, there's always way higher people buffing for
free (my Shm is only 30). I understand that lots of money requires lots of
effort, so I'm not asking for the secret monster that drops 37k pp every
spawn. I don't know what I'm looking for, actually, but any advice is
greatly appreciated.







Here's the long story, for those who are interested: I have been playing
maybe 2 months, have 3 characters (30 shaman, 19 ranger, 16 chanty). I
always group with people to gain xp, and we always compare how cool our
weapons/armor/stuff is. But when I put up my 100pp club and say how I went
broke to buy it they laugh and say their sword was cheap at 1.5k. I'm
frustrated that I have so little money that when my shaman gets a new set of
spells I can usually afford 2, three if I'm lucky on the loot, that's only
if I don't train any skills at my guild either. It seems like I must be
doing something wrong if everyone I talk to has the money they need while I
have never had more than 500pp during the entire life of my 30 shaman. When
I buff in PoK, there's always a couple 50+ shammys there, and I can't
compete with them, and if I go to a newbie zone, they have less money than I
do or are stingy with their money regardless of how much they have. The only
idea I have is get my main to 60+ and kill the creatures with big loot, then
transfer over the cash to outfit my lower characters. But what do I do to
fund my main while he's *getting* to 60+? Thanks in advance.

Thanks.
