That's because I gather Zahal has the life expectancy of the average
Ancient Cyclops, given that he aggros *everything* - guards, gypsies,
whatever - some NPC will helpfully kill him for you soon after he
spawns.

I spent a couple of levels in EK hunting griffenes and griffons, and I
think I saw him once or twice (killed him once and went and got a bracer
for a cleric friend).

I would guess just camping at Regis' spawn point and logging in straight
after a server boot should work, his PH won't last long.
