It generates a lot of agro.

I've used it on myself when pulling because if 1 player is the only one in
the group to have taken damage, its a 2 second cast 4000 hp heal. But the
cleric still gets agro, somewhere under complete heal agro but more than
supernal remedy agro.

He's not a main cleric (rogue with a perma cleric bot) but he has got a
boat-load of AA's (most in the guild on just his rogue, let alone the 100 on
his cleric too)
