That's exactly right. I always go with whatever adventure is
requested/picked, doesn't matter to me. Rescue missions are the ones that I
hear the most objections to. Why? "Because you have to keep the mob alive or
you lose the mission". Well, yeah, that's the challenge of that mission
type, right? I did my first Rescue last night and, to be honest, it was duck
soup. We just made sure to clear out every mob in sight on our way to the
target so that none of them would be around to complicate our return trip.
No problemo.

Nor have I. I constantly hear that one should only take Collection > 27,
that anything less is "bugged". Not sure what's up there, I've never lost
one of these for want of finding enough items (other reasons, yes).

I just chalk these stories up to the usual sort of mythology that grows up
around anything in the game. Some of it's based on reality, much of it
isn't, based on someone's anecdotal (and incomplete) experience.

THAT's what I want to know. Why force the annoying delay in the first place?
Do they believe that it causes people to go with the first choices offered
instead of continuing to shop? Of course it doesn't have this effect. All it
does is cause it to take 5 times longer to get an adventure, because people
who feel strongly enough about this issue just wait and wait until their
type arrives.
