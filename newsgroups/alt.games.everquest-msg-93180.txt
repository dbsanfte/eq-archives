Sorry about all the typo's. LoL, anyway what i was saying was that is it
normal to spend about 10kpp  to  raise  that far, yes  i  did gold ruby
because  of where it trivialed.  yeah the  platinum malachite is crazy.
Anyway
im trying to get a buddy of mine to make  the geerlock gemsetter for me i
have the  lens's which is the rare part, the rest of items can be purchased
for around 5pp i understand.

   anyway on the gemsetter i waas told it trivials @ 218  does this mean  it
will only mod your skill  so your success rate  like your  a 218 triv, OR
does it mean that  when you get  to 218 skill it wont  raise your mod any
more? anyone know thanks
