Yes, the new LFG areas will be at the Adventurer Guild camps - the places
you go to get quests.  "30-40 group LF tank and healer" will echo from the
mountains of Butcherblock and the sandy dunes of Ro.  I think it's also
going to be the new place for enchanters and clerics to set up buff-sales -
PoK will still be popular, but anywhere folks congregate to form groups
you'll find buff salesfolk.
