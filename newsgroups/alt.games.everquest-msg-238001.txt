Well I think that would be the next step, considering I defragged, 
checked for errors, made sure DirectX was current (which it already 
was), my graphics and sound card drivers are current, everything 
imaginable is current.

Lets see if rolling back the drivers for graphics will work then.

Oh, and I personally only called it lag as a generalised term, because 
that's pretty much what EQ is doing...lagging behind my actions :-)
