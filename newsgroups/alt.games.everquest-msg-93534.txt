Technically, you don't *need* it for the epic stone, if you kill the *real*
Venril Sathir, who drops 2 Kunark Pants and 1 druid/ranger stone.   The
Venril Sathir Remains, who you *do* need Fireflys for, only drops 2 stones
and no pants, and due to the fact that he drops 2 of them, you could most
likely get the other person who is getting a stone to summon the globe.

Nevertheless, I have never been able to figure out why anyone would choose
to not buy a spell, no matter how shitty and useless it is;  it might
someday come in handy. (note: I refer to vendor sold spells, not drop-only
spells that you may not be able to find for sale, or just not in your price
range)
