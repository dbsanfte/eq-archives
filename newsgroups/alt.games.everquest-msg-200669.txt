The helm turn-in NPC that these people are talking about has moved.  Zone
into SS, go thru entrance gate, go right, & start talking to the NPCs, I
forget which one.

The main thing to do is hang out in Kael, & ask permission to tag on any
named kill.   Killing Vindi, Statue, AoW is like killing 100s of giants I
swear.  This is the fastest way bar none to get SS faction.
