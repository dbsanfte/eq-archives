 Two expansions later he's probably trivial to do without firepets. 

 Mages are good for CoH. I could see instances of us not starting a raid
if we didn't have enough people on at that time. Whereas with a mage
we'd probably start heading that way and CoH people as they got online
and wandered over. 

 Mod Rod 2 are rather nice to have on long fights and in some cases
could be considered 'vital'.
