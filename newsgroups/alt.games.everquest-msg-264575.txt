I guess that's the lesson M.P. You should have just ended your post with 
"The Game is Not Finished." and left it at that. Annie seems a little 
over sensitive when it comes to anyone suggesting she do or not do 
anything lately.

This was about as offensive as when someone says "Patches often run 
late, that's life in EQ, don't bitch about it here." 

(uh-oh... it was in quotes. IT WAS IN QUOTES! I really didn't mean to 
incite you to defend your right to bitch on patch days too.  

=)

bleh... maybe its me having the bad day...
