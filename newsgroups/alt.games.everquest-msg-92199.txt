Personally, I would go with the fireport room as well, I have used it quite
a bit.  If you prefer, there are two islands you can swim to that a boat or
raft will stop at that you can board.  One is the elven outpost island, from
which you can hop on the ship that will take you to BBM and to FV.  The
other is the ogre island where you can hop a ship (I use the term loosely)
to OT, or a raft to Oasis.  As others have said, don't worry about your
stamina, just keep your head above water, and swim on.
