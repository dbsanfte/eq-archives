My usual line up is at lvl 59

1) Spell chosen for situation - DD, Mana Tap, Boon of Garou or other
2) AE stun
3) AE Stun
4) AE stun
5) Tash
6) Mez
7) For situation at hand, usually Slow if shaman not present in group
8) For situation at hand and/or buffs swap in and out

I hardly ever have gate memmed

In encounters with NPCs that cant be stunned or mezzed I will use slot 2,3,4
for other spells tailored to the encounter

The thing with Enchanters is we have so many useful spells to tailor to any
situation it is difficult to define any one particular "usual" set up

Jontom, LVL59 Enchanter
