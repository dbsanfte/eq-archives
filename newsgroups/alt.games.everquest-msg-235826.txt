it will take you a LOT of work - literally WEEKS if not months of killing
the same mobs over and over and over and over.....and even then you'll still
be looking over your shoulder for that odd NPC that will still hate you.  if
you want to see all the old world cities, make an agnostic human warrior or
better yet, if you want to be a dark elf, make an AGNOSTIC Dark Elf
Enchanter - with their illusion spells you'll be able to travel to any
city - but no matter the illusion they will STILL SEE YOUR DEITY and kill
you for it if you pick one.

if you want to go cleric, choose a good race and deity (humans, erudites and
I believe Gnomes can choose evil deities).

Welcome to EQ!
