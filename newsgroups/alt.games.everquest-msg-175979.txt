If you're a ranger, buy yourself a fletching kit and make yourself
some cheap arrows.  Then, go find yourself a blue con mob.  Snare mob,
then walk backwards plinking arrows at it until it dies, or you run
out of arrows.  Wash.  Rinse.  Repeat.

Best places to get info on fletching are Aoenla's Fletching guide
http://members.bellatlantic.net/%7Eewj/fletchguide/index.htm and
EQTraders http://www.eqtraders.com/.

Aoenla's hasn't been updated it a while, but for low end fletching,
it's still the best.
