Save them for Poison Making skill ups.  I gained my first 120 skill ups
through actually making poisons.  Since then I have raised it to 250 at
level 60 using a Rogue Guildmaster in the PoK, and although it was pricey it
took only a matter of seconds to do and probably didn't cost more than the
components would have cost me to skill up - plus no farming involved.
I also chucked a few points into Backstab every now and then when I felt it
was lagging, and I've STILL got points to blow on something.
