  And yet their information is still false.  When you are providing
consistently false information to your customers, intentionally or not,
there is a problem.  That and that alone is my criticism of Verant.  Agree
or disagree, I still do not understand the necessity of getting insulting
about it.  Defend Verant, you get flamed.  Criticize Verant, you get flamed.
Assume a neutral stance, you get flamed.

  Let's all just cool down and tell a pill, okay?
