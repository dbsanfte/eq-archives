Perhaps. But, the difference is that in EQ, from levels 1-65 there are 
things that you are striving for whether it be quests, loot, etc. In 
CoH, after you get to level 30 or so (which happens MUCH faster than 
getting to 30 in EQ) there is nothing. What's worse, there really isn't 
anything to do between 1-30 either. You're fighting the same mobs, they 
drop enhacements that are basically the same  things you can buy. There 
is no "cool! I just got a nice piece of loot" feeling. Ever.

Like I said, the combat is fun. I mean really, really fun. Some of the 
most fun in combat I've ever seen in a MMO type game. It's just that 
pure combat for no purpose can only carry you so far. It carried me for 
the first 30 days.
