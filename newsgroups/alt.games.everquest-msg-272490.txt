Stonebrunt at a couple level ranges has a lot of mobs to kill, but they 
can be difficult to find quickly enough without a tracker, and are mixed 
with deep reds. You don't need a tracker to play there, but if you want 
to always have a mob inc, you need one. And if you don't have a tracker, 
you can go to a zillion other places and xp. (Hell even with a tracker 
you can go to better places for xp... but maximizing xp/hour really 
shouldn't be the goal.)

Yeah. I already said they were were mostly a generic dps class.

I beleive you. But then I doubt you wiped as much. And predict the 
reason you didn't wipe as much is because you didn't push the limit as 
much. For example in HS at 49 with a trio we could do the north wing, 
reasonably safely... but the south wing was much much riskier. With a 
druid we'd have stayed in hte north wing, with a cleric we could do 
south. And we died painfully often in the south wing, but we could 
afford to push our limit past the breaking point; we had rez! Like the 
ranger, we didn't need a cleric to xp, but we did need one to xp in that 
particular part of the zone effectively.
