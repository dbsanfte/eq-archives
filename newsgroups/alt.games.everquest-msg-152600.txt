In that case, get the video card first probably, 64MB, GeForce4 ti4200 is
decent, and last I checked costs around $130, 128MB version is closer to
$200.  More memory, 512MB is really good to have.  To get the most out of a
GeForce4, you really need a 1+GHz processor, but mine runs great with my
PIII-800.  I suspect that short of replacing the motherboard, you are always
going to see very low FPS in some places.  I still do in the Bazaar if I am
looking into the bazaar, or if I am looking at an AoE group in FG with spell
effects on.
