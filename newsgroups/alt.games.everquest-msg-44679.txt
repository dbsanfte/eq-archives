Closest banks would be qeynos, highpass or ogguk. As good, Id go to highpass
at high levels, qeynos at lowish... to avoid the gnolls/orcs in high pass. I
also tend to get lost in highpass, so maybe id go to qeynos anyway.
Stables have a vendor tho, and theres also a vendor at the top of aviak
village, tho hes kinda choosy who he sells to. He likes eru necros.
