Yes, I probably wasn't clear in my post but a few days ago I purchased 
an extra 512, I now have 1GB of RAM and I can run it a setting above 
balanced (the first 'Quality' setting) in both the city and outside the 
city without any noticeable slowdown whatsoever. I've noticed that the 
extra ram has allowed me to bump the settings in all of my games as high 
as they will go now, even though I'm not running a 256MB graphics card.
