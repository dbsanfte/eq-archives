So that rationalizes not making sure your cleric is compensated for their

Do you even play the game?  Sure you can make judgement calls about how
others play their class.  You're exposed to not just them playing that class
but numerous other people playing that same class.  If you constantly do
stupid things, almost every single group will eventually boot you from them.
It is less rare at high levels, but it still happens ... with the side
comment after they leave that their character must be an ebay character.  Is
this wrong?  No, not in the slightest.  If a nuker constantly nukes as soon
as the mob is pulled in, they're kicked out of the group so fast that other
groups will think we just fired off a signal flare.  If the bard only twists
one or two songs during combats, they're made to explain why they're not
twisting at least three and if their answer is "that's too much work", their
guitar follows their behind out of the group.  And if a cleric constantly
misses saving the MT or chanter thus resulting in them dying and appears not
to be playing attention to the game (probably watching TV at the same time
they're playing), they're gone as well.  So, yes, you can make judgement
calls on how others play their class.  It is done all the time and the bad
players are commonly tossed out of groups.

Never heard of even a Battle Cleric doing that.  Sounds like something
that's almost made up.

You apparently haven't played a cleric.  Unless you play a Battle Cleric
(and thus play a much unwanted class), you can only solo greens and
sometimes not even this.

Ah.  For someone that says you cannot tell another how to play a class you
don't play, you sure don't seem to heed your own words.
