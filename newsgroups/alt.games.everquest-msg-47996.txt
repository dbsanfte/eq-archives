Ry'Gorr armor is good pally armor. Some other fairly cheap items to
consider:

Adamantite Epaulets - 9ac +7wis
Crested Spaulders - 11ac +6sta
Skull Shaped Barbute - 13ac +10?svm +30?hp

You may also be able to pick up some Ro armor cheap. Ro armor is the
paladin quest armor, but you're a bit young to complete those quests,
though you can start by working on faction with the various paladin
guilds around Norrath and with the Temple of Solusek Ro (kill shadowed
men or turn in derv rings to Ortallius in the Desert of Southern Ro).
Also start collecting fairy dust. Be warned, Ro armor is a real pain to
quest.
