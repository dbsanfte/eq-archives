I find I'm becoming a lot more forgiving to people that RP a bit of a beg.

"Kind Druid, couldst thou cast thy majiks of speed upon me?" or something
like that.

Boom, sow'd.  I guess I figure if someone takes the time, mentally, to
formulate a sentence *in character*, then at least I owe them a sow.  Often
for in-character begs (NOT plz sire thouest plzest sowest me?) I'll givem
the full monty.
