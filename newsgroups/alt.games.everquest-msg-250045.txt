Of course they are.. but how comfortable would they be with no
progress? 5 hours of play in a raid or even family guild a week? Maybe
someone throws you a bone once every couple of months if you're lucky,
but i doubt it. For the 5 hour gamer, droppable stuff is the only way
they can get up and running. They at least have the option of farming
pp and items or buy/sell bootstrapping in the bazaar. Having to guild
for drops? /wave.
