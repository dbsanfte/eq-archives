}However, duck does *not* cancel the spell casting effects.  This allows you

}make a good looking entrance.  I levitate, and come running in.  While
}running, I have myself targetted, and do something like the following:
}1. Hit Harvest, and briefly duck.  Starts the nice blue Harvest particles,
}which last 10 seconds.
}2. Hit my self-shielding, and briefly duck.  Starts the glowing hands and
}some more nice particles, which last a long time (that spell takes forever
}to cast).
}3. Hit Ice Comet, and briefly duck.
}4. Hit a fire-based nuke, and briefly duck.
}5. Hit a magic-based nuke, and briefly duck.
}6. Hit a port, and briefly duck.
}7. Go back to step 1.
}As I run, all these things particles are trailing behind me.  It looks
}really great.

You forgot:

8.  Wait for those members of the wedding party who did not turn 
/spelleffects off to come back from LD.
