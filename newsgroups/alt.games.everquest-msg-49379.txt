There's a very nice pop up screen when you try and log on to a
specialized server that details exactly how it is different from the
regular servers and how the cs staff will respond differently as a
result. No one can get on an RP or a Hardcore (when it comes) server
without getting a face full of exactly what it is all about and if
they choose to ignore those rules then they damn well should be
banned.
