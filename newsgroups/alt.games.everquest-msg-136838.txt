}That very ugly-looking word

Actually, I think it's a pretty cool word.  Probably very handy for 
writing math textbooks. :)

Thanks for that.  Good to know what the neighbors are up to. :)

Aaaah!  Inalienable rights! Inalienable rights!

Hmm... 15(2) does seem like it might support accusations of 'special 
rights', actually... Looks very much like what was at issue in our dispute 
over Affirmative Action in California a couple years ago.  Oh, look, there 
it even says 'affirmative action' in the margin. :)  Of course, that's not 
really germane to the current 'special rights' debate we seem to be 
having.

All in all, it does look like a pretty good batch of rights, though. That 
33 is really weird, though.

Thanks, very enlightening.
