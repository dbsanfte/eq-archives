Shrug. How's soloing Trakanon?

Noooo, for drops that 4 people of the 54 present got on that 4 hour raid.

Remember - we raid, and raid, and raid, then raid some more. Then we might
get a drop. I got my first drop for 4 months the other day, raiding probably
2-5 days a week for about 5-8 hours a time.

Try recruiting random pickup people for tough stuff and watch them stare
at you like you're crazy. Each server has a small number of non-uber
pioneers willing to do that stuff, but the vast majority wont set foot
outside of an easy LDON with a cleric and enchanter. Its sad, but thats
life.

As for the effort/reward... GOD single group has yesterdays raid gear for
way less effort; go forth, and be merry.
