Another good spot is Rathe Mountains, because:

1.  It's even farther from a "good race" bind spot than SK or LOIO
    (few people bind in the Arena for various reasons),
2.  Most people hunting there are in their mid-30's and don't have
    a 39+ exp-rezzable cleric in the group,
3.  Players hunting Hill Giants have enough plat on them to
    pay good prices for rezzes, and
4.  There are a lot of high-level players soloing HG's for
    cash who manage to die without a cleric handy and
    don't mind paying big bucks to recover their high-level
    lost experience.

My 50+ Paladin and a 50+ Wizard friend discovered that
we could make a LOT of money selling translocates and
revives in RM.  Yes, *revives* -- my Paladin doesn't have an
exp rez yet, but people are still willing to pay good
money to not have to run six zones to get back to their
corpse when they die.
