I really don't think SoE should be in the business of selling items
unless they also take the time to farm them. And since that isn't
likely to happen they should stay out of it and simply set it up as an
option for the consumer. They'll make more money on transaction fees
then they ever will selling actual items. And if they auto-generate
the items it will devalue them pretty quick.

The thing is.. if they stay out of the way and simply adapt the system
they have now in the prescribed manner.. it works. There should be no
reason to tweak drop-rates. I understand its a concern.. but toying
with the drop rates can also be self-defeating. In my system, you make
your money off transfers.. you want items to circulate throughout the
economy. If you tweak a drop-rate until its rarer than dirt it simply
raises the price while lowering those transfers, and SoE isn't the one
selling the item, a player is.. so they see none of the cash from it
except for the transfer fee.

Since in my system.. SoE doesn't make money selling the Windblade,
only off a transaction fee, they have no incentive to rarify or
derarify the item, just simply try to achieve a drop-rate acceptable
for a rare item given the level it was gotten at.
