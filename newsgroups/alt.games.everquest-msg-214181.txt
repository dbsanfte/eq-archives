Death: When you die, you respawn at your "bind point" -- This can be
changed via soulbinder NPCs in many city zones, or other players
casting Bind Affinity on you (or on themselves). If you're bound by
someone else, you can only be bound in certain zones. If you bind
yourself, you can bind in almost any zone. After level 10, you respawn
with all your gear left on your corpse. You actually have to go back
to your corpse to recover your gear. From level 11 on, you also lose
an amount of xp based off the amount it took you to get through your
previous level. It usually works out to a 15-20%. A portion of the
lost xp can be recovered if you find a cleric, paladin, or high level
necromancer to resurrect you. Clerics get the best rezzes. Necromancer
rezzes have a high cost to them -- they require the burning of an
essence emerald, which is attained by a spell that sacrifices a
"willing" player that's above level 49(?), and that player loses the
normal death xp penalty with no chance for recovering it.

Whew. Okay, 3rd person view is doable. F9 once gives a top-down view,
twice gives an steady view from behind, the third and fourth time put
it in a fixed angle that can be adjusting using alt+your arrow keys or
pgup/pgdn and home/end, a fifth time puts it in a "rubber band" chase
camera, which is pretty useless. One last time puts you back into
first person.
