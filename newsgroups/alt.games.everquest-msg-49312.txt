Actually, what I really don't get is why they didn't just adjust the rewards
down. If it gives to much cash, reduce the range of possible cash rewards.
If it gives too much XP, reduce the XP reward.  Don't take the goofy method
of disabling a newbie quest on a totally newbie server.  It can't be that
hard to adjust, and if it is, they really need to look at their quest
engine.

BTW, I focused on the XP reward since Absor has pretty much stated they're
against quests with large XP rewards.  Why, I don't really know. It is sorta
the name of the game, after all.
