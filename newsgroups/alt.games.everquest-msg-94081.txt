Lately I have been playing EQ quite a bit and the past few days have noticed
that in my right hand (I am right handed, btw) I have a weaker grip and my
pinky and part of my ring finger are sort of numbish and weak.  they become
more numb when squeezing my hand into a fist.

A friend of mine mentioned carpal tunnel, but I was under the impression
that those nerves only effect the thumb thru middle/ring finger, and not the
pinky.. whereas this numbness is only in my pinky.

The reason I'm inquiring here is a handfull of you probably play as much (or
more) as I do, and I'm wondering if you've ever had symptoms such as
these... if so, what was it and what would you suggest I do (other than the
obvious of going to the doctor)?

I wonder if it could possibly be the way I sit when I'm playing eq.. I have
an "armchair" kind of chair that rocks instead of a regular computer chair,
I sit lower than my computer screen and desk, my elbow rests on the arm of
the chair, my wrist generally doesn't rest on anything as I play with the
mouse on the edge of the desk, and the keyboard in my lap.


anyhoo.

thanks for any insight you may have...

~Nikki
