I read it, chuckled, moved on.  But then, nobody's ever accused me of
having a politically correct sense of humor.  As you say, black humor (and
I'll note, since we seem to be dealing with humor-impaired folks in this
thread, that term has nothing to do with skin color) is a common reaction
to tragedy.  (See http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/05/Sep/katrina.html.)

You did warn in the subject that some might find it to be in bad taste.
And the post was definitely EQ-related, so it's not even off-topic.
I have no problem with the post.  (And I commend you for your work in
the relief effort.)
