I was medding at toll booth with my baby necro and was afk while getting
kids a snack.

*WHACK*
pause
*WHACK*
pause
I got back on the third
*WHACK*

I giant was standing over me.  I got up and RAN and it started attacking
other people instead of me.

The funny thing was, scrolling back I saw that it was kicking me for a
little damage (like 10-15), then saying:
"Get up, fool!"
whack!
"hello, are you there??"
whack!
"5...4...3...2...1..."
whack!!!

That's when I ran.  Funny, they could have just slaughtered me, but instead
they were slowly toying with me then left me alone.
Nice to see a little humor from a GM.

Sean...
