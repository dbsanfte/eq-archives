I repect your choice in RP'ing, but you need to keep something in
mind.

Most people playing EQ are not hard-core RPs. If they see your
character get "angry" when spells are cast on him/her, don't assume
they will know you are RP'ing. Send them a private tell (/tell
<player>), and inform them you are in character. Otherwise they might
think you are being a jerk or a butt-hole.

Cheers
