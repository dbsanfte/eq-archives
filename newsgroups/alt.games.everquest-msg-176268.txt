Of course, thats only true if taunt was a guarenteed 100% success rate.

Only AE taunt AA ability has that.  (And even that can be defeated by low
health aggro.)

All other taunts are dependant upon skill level, and current position on the
hate list.

Nope.

Won't make a bit of difference.  Other than if you need to taunt, you won't
have it available.
