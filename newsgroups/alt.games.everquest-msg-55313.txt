I've been leveling a druid in NK. Only at 20 so I won't even zone in to
EK, considering that every few minutes there's suddenly 40+ level 35+
players that have been beaten to a bloody pulp sitting on the bridge. I
zoned in ONCE just to take a peek and the pile of corpses next to the zone
line convinced me that backing back into NK was the prudent
choice. Something about an "undead dragon" slaughtering anything that gets
near it...

The plus side is I'm getting sow donations like mad ;-)

Qyenos hills goes red and kicks into "The Spell of The Undead" every
couple of hours or so. I have no idea if there's a quest that turns it off
or not.
