Play a troll in the game too?

Sure, make the time of life where you die the most even more annoying. Why
not make it so that you can't leave your newbie garden until you are 10,
too? Even better, level restrictions on every zone! While you're at it, give
spells like temp and clarity a lvl 30 restriction, and put required levels
on every bit of equipment.
