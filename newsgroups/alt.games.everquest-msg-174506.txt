Tash/Malo/OOS

At lower levels, try the various chants, although the chants themselves
can be resisted, which becomes a catch 22.

Most bard songs seem to check on magic resist, so Fufil's works best if
you are trying to stick non chants.

Chant kiting a PC, use a shorter twist, this way you don't get the
occaisional wear off before you sing the next pulse; the chants check
against the very resist they reduce, so once you stick one, sticking it
again before it wears off is easier.  If things are really hard to
stick, forget twisting, just do one chant (try different ones, each
checks a different resist so you can try and find their weak spot) and
stay ahead of them.  Eventually, even a single chant kept on someone who
can't keep up with you will kill them.   Four chants would be four times
as fast, but dead is dead, in the end.

OOS and chants are all drum based, and seem to stick more easily with a
good drum.  In addition, they reduce resists further with a good drum,
so once stuck the better the drum, the easier it is to keep sticking
them, or to stick other songs.

While snare is a good tactic against mobs, against players, go with
selos instead; that means one fewer song you have to worry about them
resisting
