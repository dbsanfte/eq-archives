1.  There aren't many 'non-high-end' particle weapons.... off the top of my
head, you've got :
-Zlandicar's heart (blue circle with blue particles coming out from it -
goes for 25k or so)
-Blood-runed battle wand (wand with red particles - 60-70k, maybe less now
that people have been expointing in Tactics...)

zheart isn't a weapon, but only goes in Primary slot... but battle wand is
21/24 1h blunt I believe.

2. Not sure what else has same graphic of wand of the ice storm...  it was
probably that anyway ;)

3.  I'd venture to say that you won't be able to get that info until GoD is
released.  If anyone posted it now, they'd be violating the NDA
