Mobs that die faster?  i.e., "had less hp".  It's not a terrible place to
hunt for casters that don't get hit, but there's much better exp to be hald
elsewhere (i.e., the Overthere where the mobs are the same level, have
half as many hp, also no casters, many more mobs to kill, as well as also
dropping fairly decent cash).

If it moves, it's a placeholder for a giant.

If you're the only person there, and you're only level 40, of course,
because the giants themselves are also placeholders for the giants.  This
doesn't work for me as I can mow through the 9 default giants (anyone *ever*
seen more than 9 up at once?) in about a minute flat.
