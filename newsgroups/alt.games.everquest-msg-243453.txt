}Extremely short version for those who don't like to read long winded crap:
}1. What early portions of the quest can definitely be skipped and still 
}have it work ok?

I doubt very much can be skipped. I've been halfheartedly working on this 
one myself.  I found no reason to skip much of it.  Going by the writeup 
on Alla's, http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1667 , I 
skipped the first conversation with Torsten and the whole bit with Roethe 
(thank goodness, as my recuso faction is bottomed out!).  My first step 
was buying dawnshroud cider and giving it to Legionnare Dalini.  Of 
course, you don't need to do this part if Bregun is already up, but he 
wasn't, and it was worth 50pp to me not to futz around.  You could use an 
entirely separate character with decent Seru faction to buy the dawnshroud 
cider and hand it to Dalini, as the only point is spawning Bregun.

}2. What factions for the various early mobs are "must have" and which 
}mobs/factions are they? (By "must have" I mean, is there a usable 
}workaround for ones you are KOS to?)

I don't really know... I did the first parts before messing up my Seru 
factions, and it all went smoothly. :)

}3. Is just killing Bregun Dorey sufficient to kick it off and does he 
}give a faction hit?

I didn't do such a thing... poor little halfling!  Just make him some darn 
bixie crunchies. They have a baking trivial of about 56, so if you ever 
made fish rolls it should be no problem.  You can skip the conversation 
and just give him the crunchies.  I don't think Bregun is KoS to anyone... 
but he does get very annoyed if he sees you picking on his troglodyte 
friends. If you're KoS to him for some reason, you might try having him 
charmed.

}Early parts: I've read comments online from some people saying you 
}*MUST* do every single step of the quest or the next mob won't spawn, 
}etc.

BS. :) So far, the only triggered spawn has been Bregun.

}Other reports say you can start by just handing in the drink to 
}Legionaire Dalini and getting Bregun to spawn.

I did thet thar thing.

}Yet another said that if 
}you kill Bregun, he'll *drop* the bixie charm you need for the next 
}step. 

Yea, he presumably will, and you take it back to Torsten and he says "Oh! 
you know where Bregun is! Run give him this note for me real quick."  And 
you say to yourself, "ooopss..."

}I've been told killing the guards outside MS will result in Dalini 
}eventually spawning on his own, but others say he must be spawned by the 
}previous step. 

I haven't yet seen Dalini not up, the few times I've checked.  If he ain't 
up for some reason, hey, try again later.  Or see if Bregun's up for 
whatever reason, and then you won't need him anyway. :) I found Bregun up 
fairly regularly when I was farming porous mineral blocks for tinkering.

}Because of possible faction issues (below) I'd like to 
}cut as much of this off as possible. Can I start this quest further 
}along than the beginning?

Most of the NPCs involved seem to be on Katta factions, despite being in 
Seru.  Many of the drops require farming in Seru and messing up -all- your 
seru factions.  About 5 guildies now have the arx key, and none of them 
have reported any problem.  Note, this is also in a guild that used to 
farm Lcea Katta and Nathyn Illuminious... Although I can't say for sure 
that those who did the quest were there then. :)  

I don't know if it's possible to MQ it at a later step.  One possibility, 
though, might be going to Tilbok Furrunner in Katta and saying 'what 
chambers'.  If he gives you a satchel, you may be able to MQ it by filling 
the satchel with the reports and having an alt that did the first two 
earrings hand in their earring before giving the full satchel back to 
Tilbok.

}Faction issues: We've not only killed Seru multiple times, but spent 
}time clearing the vamp castle in TM repeatedly. As such, I think I'm max 
}ally in Katta, and there are wanted posters up for me in every post 
}office in Sanctus Seru and MS. I'm guessing Legionaire Dalini will be 
}KOS to me, since he's an MS guard? How about the spawned Bregun? Is he 
}on any faction? And the two guys in Sanctus Seru... Torsten and Euzan. 
}I'm hoping they are spies on Katta faction instead of Seru faction or 
}I'm definitely screwed. Is that right? For the ones that I *must* do 
}turnins with, etc. (without having somebody else do them, charm them, 
}wolf form, or whatever) is there a workaround or am I stuck killing a 
}billion of something for faction?

If you gotta kill a billion of anything, it's probably recuso in marus 
seru for assorted seru factions. :)  Basically, the first part requires 
50pp and 4 bixie parts, and maybe a half hour of running around.  The 
second part may require someone to invis you, for the handin to the 
File Cabinet.  See how that goes before you worry about it.

Btw, as I recall Guard Hargrar (the guy who spawns when you do the File 
Cabinet handin) was mezzable.  But it's been a while.  Either way, fleeing 
the scene was easy.
