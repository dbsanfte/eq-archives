I would have to disagree *slightly*. They can be a very, very cheap way to
level pottery by making idols (the Karana idols, which have 3 WIS, 2 vs Magic
and Karana worshippers only, are a *nice* thing for those Karana druids,
clerics and paladins to carry in their ranged slots.) They can be used not
only in Vale armor, but I think some of the Qeynos made human cultural, as
well (Karana imbued full plate, anyone?)

I would suggest: Get a breeze or clarity then imbue the lot; it will stack
then and free up a bunch of bank space. I assume you are a druid of Karana? If
you can bring a halfling tailor some brute hides (brutes, best found in
Warslik Woods and other zones in Kunark) and a stack of imbued pebbles, you
could probably get some very nice leather armor made for yourself.  Vale
studded is lighter and has slightly better AC than regular reinforced leather
and Vale reinforced is even better; Karana imbued adds wisdom and stamina (and
what druid can't use more of either?.)  The imbued plains pebbles can also be
used by wood elf smiths to make a few items.

Just hold on to them, and auction for a buyer. I personally (Halfling druid,
Karana, of course) would be willing to pay up to 10pp for a stack of imbued
pebbles where I didn't have to forage then bless them; and I would be willing
to give as much as 20pp in trade for them, especially with a round of Vale
studded coming up. Non druid tailors might be willing to pay/trade for twice
that amount, but don't count on it. If you are on Xev, look for Rosewhite :-)
