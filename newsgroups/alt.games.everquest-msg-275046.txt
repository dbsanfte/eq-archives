The problem stems from not being able to purchase the needed components 
(when you need them) for any amount of money.   I know, you can bother other 
players, friends or not, bug them to make the stuff so you can buy it.   But 
the more casual player does not want to go through all that.

This does not mean that the market for these components has changed much. 
Many will still rather purchase the stuff than take the time to make it.

BTW, I do no tradeskills at all, ever, absolutely no time.   However, I do 
sell the stuff off for my wife.
