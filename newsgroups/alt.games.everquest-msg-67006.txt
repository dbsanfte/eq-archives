Actually this is true of any subscription service. Bottom line, verant
is a business and a subscription service. Whatever applicable laws
about running such a service (I don't know them in particular)
probably say that they operator of said service can up the rates as
long as customers are notified. 

For example, I get cable and my rates were raised. I have zero legal
recourse. The only recourse I have is the same as with ANY
subscription service, I can cancel said service and possibly get back
any forward paid subscription fees which no longer apply (and they
could really drag their heals on this and make it quite difficult and
still not be breaking the law)

So I'm also addicted to cable because I still want that even though my
requirements as a customer changed? Times change, requirements change,
prices go up. The actual wonder is that verant DOESN'T raise the $9.99
rate. They really should since it makes good business sense. As the
producer said it was a HUGE mistake to not do it at the time and
instead make it like UO's rate then make it $9.89 because of 989
studios (a gimick) However it very likely well never be raised because
to do so would be a lot of bad press and possibly lose customers.

This is what verant knows:

A customer may quit, but currently his character nor his account is
ever deleted. No characters have ever been deleted. Some customers
have now quit for a month or more as many as 3 or 4 times ( I have
twice) The fact that the $9.89 price is still frozen, makes them many
times more likely to pick up their subscription again. A customer
coming back and paying $9.89 again even if for 6 months before
quitting is worth more to them than having a $12.95 fee and that
customer not returning. They know this, so its very unlikely you will
see that rate change. That customer adds $9.89 more to their cash pile
while not really increasing costs at all.

Time does march on, someday all tvs will be high definition which are
sold, some time after that cable and other broadcasters will only
broadcast in high def. Someday possibly everyone will have to upgrade.

Next time you put a game cd in your cd tray, remember the posts from
alarmists back when I started playing computer games saying that if we
continue to buy games from companies only putting games on CDROM that
everyone will have to have CDROM drives in their computers. Well, we
did and they do. It seemed more expensive at first but now its
standard and it had to eventually happen at the point where I bought
ultima 7 black gate on floppies and it came on 7 of them. 

Progress is a good thing, not a bad thing.
