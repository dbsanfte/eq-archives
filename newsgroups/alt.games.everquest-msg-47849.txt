Sigh is right...  I'll just let a copy/paste of line 7 from the actual EULA
that we all must press "Accept" to before we can play.


"... You may not copy (except to make one necessary back-up copy),
distribute, rent, lease, loan, modify or create derivative works, adapt,
translate, perform, display, sublicense or transfer the Software. You may
not copy any of the written materials accompanying the CD-ROM..."

Take note of "distribute."


"Main Entry: dis�trib�ute
Pronunciation: di-'stri-by&t, British also 'dis-tri-"by�t
Function: verb

- implies an apportioning by separation of something into parts, units, or
amounts"

Now.  As to whether or not I give two rats asses that you or anyone else
send him any portion of the EQ CD, I don't.

However, I will inform those who may actually believe that you know what you
are talking about, that you indeed do not.

Good day.
