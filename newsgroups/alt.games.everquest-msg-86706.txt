  Dang, you sure are pissed!!!!  I'm sure if'n you write those fellers in a
little less angry tone, they might just refund your purchase price.  Heck,
they might even go ahead an' give ya a month fer free!!!  But I reckon you
sound quite done with that there Everquest game.  Well, I'm gonna sit back
right here in my basement an' look at the February John Deere calendar girl,
eat my Cheetos (I ain't much fer them dang Doritos, they git stuck in
betwixt them thar spaces in muh teeth)  an' play me some Everquest (that gal
on the front sure is purty ain't she?!)
