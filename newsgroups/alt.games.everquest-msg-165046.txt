We are going to spawn the Corrupted DEs in EK tonight for a druid in our 
guild working on his epic.  From some reading it looks like the best thing 
to do ( since we don't have a buttload of people ) is have the Druid bind 
where our camp is ( near the spawn ), do the run-in, then gate to us.

I'll pre-battle rune IV on everyone ( for HTs ) and then have 1 or 2 people 
kite the Reavers away while we take down the Corrupted.  The druid loots 
and turns in the piece to the Druids.

This sound feasible?  I'm guessing we will have...

45 ENC
52 DRD
53 RNG
57 CLC
53 MAG

... but, after that, it's hazy.  There is a possibility of a 53+ Pally and 
a 60 pally showing.

Are the reavers Mezzable?  I've read they are level 40 and I've read they 
are level 50, so I don't know what to expect.

Also, can we do this back-to-back?  The 53 Mage has a 56 (?) Ranger that is 
ready for this part of his epic, too.

And, while we are there, we want to do Tarbull for the Mage.  Is there a 
trick to getting him to spawn?

I was slaying spiders and cats in EK the other day and a high-level Necro 
was doing the same.  We were chatting about Proon, Broon, etc. while we 
killed and he said something about Hill Giants being "under the zone."  Any 
clue what he meant?  I don't know of any tunnels there.  I do remember 
reading here that FoB allows some mobs to get under the land where they can 
whomp you but not vice-versa, maybe that is what he was saying.
