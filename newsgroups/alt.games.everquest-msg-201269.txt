Yes, to both of you.

For other flags, you need all the flags before the end one too (e.g for
Saryn you need saryn, and KoS, and TT, and Hedge).  Same for MM, Agnar (BoT
quest) etc - only solro so far is the exception.

With the upcoming flag changes for the lowbies, they should take the time to
re-evaulate the whole system (i mean, they're gonna fuck it up anyway,
aren't they?)

E.g - I can kill Saryn.. I can kill TT.. why the fuck do I still need to
find 18 people to sit through a tedious and trivial maze walkthrough?

I can kill Rallos Zek.. why do I need to go kill a trivial giant in
PoStorms, to "prove" myself?

I like the flagging concept, but looking back, it went too far.  Remove the
earlier shit, let a final boss flag count as all the tedious pre-flags too.
If you can even <spawn> Bertox, you did more than you've ever done by
killing Grummus.  Let the flagging system reflect this!
