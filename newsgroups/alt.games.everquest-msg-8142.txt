As far as I know SOL A is the only place to buy a Tinkerers Bag. Next being
an evil Race you will Probably be KOS with the Gnome in SOL A. If You are on
Prexus send a tell to Orax or Singinn I sell the Bags regularly for 5500p
250p above cost. You may want to check in EC to see if anyone on your server
does the same. Very east to get my wrost case had to fight a total of 6 high
teens low 20s Goblins 1 was a wizard no one else was in the zone my level 35
Monk didn't get any exp off of them didn't have to much problem. The first
part of the trip be careful not to fall in the Lava.
