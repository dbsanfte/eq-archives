: Well think about it realistically from a business standpoint...IGE is
making
: money off of SOE's game. SOE can either put IGE out of business by a long
: and convoluted lawsuit (only to have another one show up) or they can feed
: them plat and items and reap a portion of the profits. I'm actually
: surprised SOE hasn't started selling items and plat on their own. Can't
get
: that uber item in our game that you've wanted for so long? Don't have 3
days
: to sit and camp a randomly spawning mob? pay us x dollars and we'll equip
: you with it. Kinda like their "service" to move your character to another
: server. Give us $50-$250 and you don't have to do the work of starting
: another character on another server
:

As long as it's a special server, they can sell level 65s, for all I care.
Just keep em away from me.
