I'm not going to condemn you.

The people who have been through Katrina and those who are dealing with the
results have been through so much and deserve a little slack.  Hell, we all
are a bit off due to the tragedy.  BUT, I think it's just a wee bit too soon
even for those who might enjoy that sort of humour.

This is weird.  The only responses I see are from Vidden and Impmon.  I
never got 42's response (except where quoted) or any of the "many" offended
people.
