Is Kithicore in the daytime too dangerous for a level 12 mage that just
wants to deliver some mail?  I'm reading the eqAtlas information that says
the area has become much more dangerous, even in the daytime.  I'll just be
passing through on my way to HighKeep.

If it is a "substantial" risk, does mail delivery have a time limit, or can
I just hold onto it until I've reached an appropriate level?

Cheers,
Eric

Stick to the zone wall and I don't think you'd have too much trouble.
I've even done it at night time a few times and made it.
I'm a bard and although I use Selo's through here I've never encountered
anything along the zone wall as yet between the Rivervale / HHP ent/exits.
