After it has a web page, it doesn't now.

Both. They first do closed in house, later might invite people from
the test server (as with luclin and planes of power) who have shown
good testing skills, next open phases/stress test phase.

Hunh? I played EQ, what do you mean "screw up your system badly"?

I played lots, like all day long. It was fun. They really don't tell
you as a public tester to do particular things, they just want to you
play as you regularly would and bug stuff you see as being bad. Mostly
its a stress test and actualy noticeable broken stuff they already
know about.

Not me no. People seemed to get rich enough fast enough anyway by the
end of the beta, some even got to near level 50.

There was not a whole lot to really test then that some of the players
could not test. They had not even added the planes yet or solusek A
and B, temple of sol ro, the mid level class armor quests to replace
rubicite, etc, none of that was in.
