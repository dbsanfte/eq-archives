I'd strongly suggest Crystal Caverns. I still see lots of blues at 40
and with your level you should be able to rip through most of the orcs
there without much trouble. 

Other benefits include a bank, a chance at some great loot (herbalist
pack, Crystal Covered Shroud, etc...) mob's through your mid 40's if
you go deeper, and on Xegony I rarely see 20 people in the zone.

Went there at 34 with lvl 40+ friends and they got me through 35 in no
time! Heck, I still go back.

A+

Musana, 40 druid, Xegony
