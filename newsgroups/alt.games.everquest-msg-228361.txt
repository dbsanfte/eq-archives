This is one advantage of my method; I whack f8 and get a target 
instantly (probably not the one the MA has selected, but something), 
then send pet.  He engages and gets the attention of that mob and 
possibly other mobs in the vicinity (if they aren't in melee range of 
PCs of course).  Then chanter hits AE mez, pet backs off unless he 
happens to have an unmezzed target, either the one I sent him at or any 
other one that's taken a swing at him.

If MT then breaks a mez and moves the mob back, I can pivot so the 
cluster of mezzed mobs isn't in arc, f8 and send pet again.

Once whatever my pet is curently parking has been mezed (or dies), he'll 
switch to the real target.  In the mean time, its entirely possible that 
he's parking adds that would otherwise be down the throat of the chanter 
who got mez resist.

This doesn't work if the MT doesn't move the target out of the cluster, 
but I am capable of using fn (where n is the MA number in group), assist 
key, attack when this occurs, I'm just too lazy and set in my ways to do 
it when it doesn't seem necessary.

I'm told that pets will break mez, but to date I've yet to see it once, 
and I'm very alert to the possibility, after all that time as an 
enchanter and mezzing bard.
