Keep in mind that there are level caps on skills.  Weapon skills for
priests are either (level+1)*4 or Level*4 - if the latter, you're
just capped, if the former you're just being unlucky in skillups.  High
dex helps with weapons skill ups.

1.  Don't bother with hand to hand - only monks and BL's get any use
out of it, everyone else caps too low.
2.  Fight at least cyan mobs, but preferably blue or higher to get 
combat skillups.
