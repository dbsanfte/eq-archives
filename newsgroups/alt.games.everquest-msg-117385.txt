> OK - Lets hear from the Druids - When can you track corpses?  

Right after a person in your group dies, before they reenter the zone 
and before you leave the zone, you should (usually) be able to track 
their corpse.  I've been told that corpses are part of the world, not 
mobile objects, so I believe distance is no limitation, just as with 
tracking live players in your group, and I think the location should 
never be bugged.  I don't know for sure though.

When a group member is in the same zone you are, their hit point bar in 
your group list is red.  When they are in a different zone it's a 
different color.  When a group member dies and you haven't zoned yet, 
the bar is a third color.  I think when the bar is this third color 
(grey or pink, I can't remember) is when you can track the corpse.  I 
could be totally confused on this though.

It's interesting to note that if you start tracking a corpse and the 
player enters the zone while you are doing the tracking, you can keep 
tracking the corpse.  But you can't start again if you lose your 
tracking target since what's in your tracking list is now the player, 
not the corpse.

If you are concerned about being able to find corpses you should always 
carry at least one corpse locate wand (buy for about 6 plat at an 
alchemy vendor).  These wands have 3 charges of a locate corpse ability 
that I think is the same as the level one necro spell.  It doesn't work 
as well as tracking, but is useful in more situations.

Hope that helps.  Corrections welcomed :)
