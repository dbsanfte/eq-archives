Hi all, like some others, ever since Luclin, I am crashing while
zoning in Velious and Kunark.  Loading in these continents is taking a
lot longer then it used to prior to Luclin.  In contrast, zoning in
the old world is now faster than it was before and I am not crashing
there for some reason.  I have purchased Luclin and now my computer
graphics are slower than ever.  I have installed the new textures and
deleted EQ and not installed the new textures, no help.  My current
system is as follows

P2-350MHZ(Yes, I know it's slow)
256MB Ram
Voodoo 3 2000 AGP
Yamaha sound card

My question was how much better would EQ run if I upgraded my Voodoo 3
and got one of those Geforce 2 MX 400 cards?  Would it help a lot or
is my main processor so slow it wouldnt really make much difference? 
I am also hoping it may help on the crashes while zoning issue.  Well
thanks for any replys.
