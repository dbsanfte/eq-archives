Maybe not that bluntly, but...

Falling deaths for unreasonable damage upon entering zones, deaths in
lava, deaths due to the "geometry" of the game....these all count as
unreasonable deaths and as such are considered situations where even a
Guide (except apprentices) can rez you for 100% experience and no
mana/hp/stat recovery time necessary.

If you die due to LD, you are SOL.  The Everquest team cannot
determine whether you went LD involuntarily or merely /q'ed.  Since
some people would use this as an exploit and try to get free
experience back without actually having died because of a linkdeath,
the team errs on the side of caution.

I know this because I used to be a Guide - all of this is in the
Policies and Procedures manual that Guides have to learn.
