If you get UOTrace, a small free app designed originally to check
out UO's servers, you can easily ping, trace the route, and poll the
servers to get a great picture of your connection.

When you run it after installing, don't automatically load the UO
servers, unless you want to :-), and then just type in for whatever
server you want to check:

[ eq server ].everquest.com       ..without the brackets

I have been doing this for a couple days and there's been a real bad
bottleneck around the  6th or 7th hop [ for me ] in the LA [ if I remember 
right ] area.
