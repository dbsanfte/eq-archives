If you research them, or just stumble across them, you find that the
challenging single-group content has many rewards that appeal even to
raiders.

There's no need to "convince" a group to go to such a place.  If your
ambitions exceed your peer group, look for a group of actual *peers*.

DKP systems are intentionally limited to meet their specific purpose
(encouraging attendance for the most part).

Raids are limited by the mechanics of this (or any) game.  I think Sony has
done a pretty good job with making encounters with some variety, but the
focus will never stray far from the tank/healer/slower/dps distinctions.

No creativity does not imply no free will.  Using an example of a Vishimitar
raid, there is a "buff" you might get near the end that will kill you in ~30
seconds if you don't find a wandering mob and say the right key phrase.  The
"robotic obedience" part is that you *must* get that buff removed.  Anyone
that dies spawns an add.  One person not being "obedient" to that raid
instruction threatens the success of the raid.

I consider MMs to be great for socializing and grinding.  When I'm
"grinding", even as my monk, it doesn't matter that I'm a monk.  I'm not
putting any monkly skills to the test.

Even better, the training of being dropped into an encounter that has to be
completed in a certain way is a great introduction to the sort of mindset
required to be a good raider.

I don't agree with it myself.  But complaining about this and complaining
about mudlfation at the same time are at odds with each other.

I agree mostly.  WoW was obviously the product of great programmers, but the
"game" is too easy.  I see that in any post-EQ game.  Of course, the
subscription numbers show that this is the path to success (short term or
long term as yet to be determined).

It wouldn't shock me if Vanguard were a spectacular flop, for exactly the
above reason.

I will be positively amazed if they have any sort of AI whatsoever.  No MMOG
has had even a rudimentary AI yet, and I really don't think the technology
is there to be able to have an AI in an MMOG yet.  Don't be too surprised
when that "AI" turns out to be nothing more than the scripting that exists
in every other game.
