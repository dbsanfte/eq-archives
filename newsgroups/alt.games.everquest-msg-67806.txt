Mezzing anything else that is around = good. I did the AoF camp for
exp when I was level 34 first time I played, and I'd heal, buff, DS,
nuke (getting killing blow on AoF in a close fight once :) ) and
occasionally charm crocodile adds for pets. About the HT... I took it
twice of the 3 times we pulled/got aggroed by AoF, most likely by
virtue of sitting on my butt when he charged. It was 400 points and
came close to killing me, but since the tanks we had (monk and 2
rogues) got his attention before he could hit me more than once, I
survived the HTs both times.

We'd camp him in a small room off the side of the water bubble; we'd
get there either through the croc pool, or through the bubble while a
PH was up. Clear out as many spawns as you can so you get as few adds
as possible when the AoF spawns.

(Damn, it's been over a year since I was there...)
