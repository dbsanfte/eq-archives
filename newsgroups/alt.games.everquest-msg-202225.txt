One thing they did right in the Hole as compared to Old Chardok, the
casters in the Hole are lower lvl than the melee mobs there. Only the
Rocks, undead and rats are 50+ so it isn't nearly the deathtrap to
pull that Chardok was. Mob density except for a couple of bad pathing
spots is actually pretty good once you figure the place out. I used to
regularly pull the place in deep with my mid 50s shaman when there
wasn't a puller with us that knew the zone (easy to learn with a low
lvl rogue to explore). You can pretty much always keep your pulls to 4
or fewer mobs. But yeah, the only real advantage to going in deep is
the higher density of Rock Golems. Set up down by the docks and you
can probably keep a dozen rock spawns cleared. Used to make for good
money on the IGS market <g>.
