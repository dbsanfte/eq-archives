1201 total hits, 577 droga goblins, 589 salt/skin turn ins (rest of the hits
in Nurga or FM), one droga hit was Warlord Skargus from helping a friend do
his second ring (reportedly a 300 pt faction hit /shrug).

http://how.to/chardok

I started at max kos (took one negative dizok hit on the goblin traitor
oops), now somewhere in mid-dubious.

It's fun to wander around chardok and say hi to people hunting, then they're
like "wtf dont train us" and I just laugh and go sit down next to a sarnak
and go afk.

Oh yeah, and got the VP key piece from niblek (4 medallion pieces down, 5 to
go)

Granted though now I need to get higher faction to use the vendor and work
on my rings/cords.
