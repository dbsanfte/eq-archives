Yes, they have intel boxes where I work to. Along with some as/400s.

But I have an older slower machine running linux. It updates and
works faster than Intel/Windows boxes with faster cpus. I've seen a
486 running linux run faster and better than a Pentium II running
Win98se.

I've done tech support, installs,upgrades, etc., on computers since
1987. Windows has major faults I don't like, but I'm stuck using
them.

Myself, I don't care what kind of computers other people use. Each
system has its advantades and disadvantages. To me, Windows
disadvantages out weigh its advantages.
