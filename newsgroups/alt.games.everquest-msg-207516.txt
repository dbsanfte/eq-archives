Had there not been zone lines in the original game, and they were added
because of issues with aggro never being removed...

It's called circular logic, and works equally well from either "end" of the
circle.  :)

You think that was a bolstering, eh?  It's called a business decision when
they realized the practice was *so* pervasive that trying to make it a
violation of the rules would have resulted in EQ's version of civil unrest.

I would go so far as to say that yet again you have in fact bolstered the
other side of the argument.  If the "GMs across the game *ruled*..." then
obviously the "intended use of zoning" wasn't nearly so clearly intended to
players at the time, nor even the GMs.  :P
