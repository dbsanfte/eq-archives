ok I miss read the 1/3 part. However most decently equiped AAed melee's
sustain 100+ under typical conditions. I manage 150 or so with out TS when
averaged so I'm personally tearing your water pet up even in melee I manage
about 100dps. Further you only specified optimal conditions and under
optimal conditions I can do quite a bit more than 270dps and I'm not that
well equiped.
The really high end peeps are sustaining close to 200 so while that's not
270 that's still substantially higher than your water pet under ideal
conditions.
His point about not grouping with good melee's still stands. Even if the 1/3
assertion doesn't.
Admitedly pet classes have an advantage over melee when dealing with lesser
equipment but when you start talking about melee with good high end weapons
that all changes. Hell I can do 90-100dps easiliy with my dual weild set up
and its only a windworn and swifty (12/18 and 14/21 respectively) imagine
how those numbers would change with some higher end gear like an ahb 16/19
or timespinner 23/22?
