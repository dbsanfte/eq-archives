I guess my point was that losing agro might be the least of your
problems.  Perhaps I'm reading it wrong but if your spell casting slows
down 90%, that 3 or 4 second cure spell is gonna take 30 or 40 seconds.
Heck, maybe it only reduces non-innate spell casting speed buffs,
which is a minor annoyance, especially since it won't even affect CH's,
which cannot be hasted anyway.
