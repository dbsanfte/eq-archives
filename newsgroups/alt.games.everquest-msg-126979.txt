Humm Do the pet spells work on any pet ?
Or just the BL's own pet ?
Any pet would be evil, so that can't be how it works.
(Talk about powerleveling, here Mr Lvl 1 necro have a lvl 47 pet :-P)

So BLs can only charm by item, shame :-(

Searching Al's I can't actually find any items with charm / charm
animal.
Only
Pouch of Mistletoe Powder (Befriend Animals)

OR Dark Oak Shillelagh (Beguile Plants 3 proced charges) (BST useable)

Did I hear that there were some baby Tree ents in Gfay on Test <G>
Giant Tree takes back treetown !
Or do they count as monsters ?

Are there any Plants in the game ??

Shame that BLs cant charm Flippy Darkpaw.
Or Queen Kallanxxx.
Or the Bixi queen.

Now that would be fun.

Jim
