November 25th 2003

    I left Everquest in June because I moved and started a new Job.
Now I am moving back home but I let my Everquest Subscription run out
that was billed under the one credit card. in order to play Everquest
again do I just have to enter a new credit card # and just let the
patcher run. Because the old credit card is now expired but everquest
and everything is still installed on the machine so I think its just a
matter of changing the billing address is this true. Also will my
chracters still be there?
