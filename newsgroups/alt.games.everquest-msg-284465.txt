Having settled on shadowknight as one of my finalists for a Combine server 
character (I know, they weren't even in the early running), I'll chime in 
here.

First, thanks for the write-up. Though it will be some time before I need 
it (if ever), I'm glad you've summarized it here.

Secondly, ShadowKnight.org, though it had great potential with a lot of 
very useful information, was perhaps the most immature and clique-ish 
fansites I had ever had the displeasure of frequenting in the past. It went 
from a knowledgeable resource that was well worth enduring the regular 
pompous attitudes exhibited, to some sort of exclusive sort of chat room, 
cutting that useful information off by allowing search-only access which 
was poorly implemented by the forum software they used. Even though I'm 
playing a shadowknight, I won't miss that site at all.

/em peers suspiciously into his coffee cup.

Huh, between this and the plat sellers thread, I'm thinking I may have 
awoken on the wrong side of the bed this morning. Any kumbaya topics you 
might care to broach today, Lance? :P
