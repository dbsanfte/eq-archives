Tails are pretty slim.  There's a catlike tail, a skinny ratlike tail, a 
liony tail (with tuft at the end), a lizardy tail, and a devil tail.

Lacking a proper short, brushy type tail, the Masked Hyena went tailless.  I 
gave the cat-tail to the Brown Hyena, and of course the ratwomen have rat 
tails.
