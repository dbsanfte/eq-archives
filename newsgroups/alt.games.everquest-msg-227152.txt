My main group used to average low or under 60 because two of my friends were
58 we could do dungeons without slow pretty easy. But as soon as they both
got to 60 mobs difficulty increased dramatically and we couldnt do it
without slow any more. When your group averages 60+ in LDoN every mob will
need to be slowed.
