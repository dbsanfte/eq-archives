As with my druid and Rogue:
Not real rich.... but can sell some stuff from alts to buy if
needed.... but would rather quest/kill for the possible drops. 
I have the ability to hunt higher zones with my 52 cleric and
friends... but it would be fun to aqurie em with my little monk.

so some people may appear bright,
