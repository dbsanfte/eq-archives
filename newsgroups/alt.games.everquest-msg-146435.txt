Just find the testeverquest.exe program in your everquest directory instead
of
everquest.exe and run that.

You can swap between the two just by running each program, but be
aware that the patches are usually different on each one so you'll
patch and repatch each time you swap.

Easiest way to avoid this if you have enough disk space is to make a
copy of the whole everquest directory structure and run test from
one and the normal eq fom the other
