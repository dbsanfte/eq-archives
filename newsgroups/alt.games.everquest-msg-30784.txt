At lvl 39 you probably are better off soloing cougars and such by fear
kiting them, and you can keep doing that for quite a few lvls, i mean not
just cougars, but other animal mobs in velious that can be feared by
rangers, but once you get into your 50s you'll find out there isnt much
soloing for Rangers and you'll be glad to accept an invitation from a group,
at 55 the thought of going out and soloing for xp isnt an option, or at
least a reasonable one.
