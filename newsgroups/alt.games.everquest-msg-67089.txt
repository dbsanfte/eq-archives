Nah it's not. Just the normal childrens problems that every new software
product has.

: low frame rates, crappy looking character models

Upgrade your ancient machine or get a clue about drivers. Blame them because
you run an ancient machine or badly setup machine. Serves you right :)

: why did they have to change anything, i liked my EQ just the way it was.

I think of it as a major advancement. I hope the refine it and do even more.

: now the game runs like a pile of fecal matter.

Fecal matter can run? Thought it just stinks.

: all you fanboys can rant and rave, but the truth of the matter is this

And you are? An opposing boy ranting and raving? 

: release looks like a bunch of hacked up lame graphics thrown over a engine
: that was doing just fine if you ask me.

You mean better graphics and an intention to speed up the load of those
polygons by enhancing the engine? How care if YOU try to run that
on a graphics card from 1992.
