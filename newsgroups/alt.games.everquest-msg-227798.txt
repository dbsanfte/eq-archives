Always catch the piglet at the beginning of the stampede, not the end, or
you run a good risk of having it poof just like you saw.

A necro is the best person to get the piglet, because they can snare and
then FD.  But any snaring / kiting class is all right; snare the piglet,
kite off any adds, maybe root-park adds while the rest of the group gets the
piglet.

Anyway, that's they way my groups have always done it.  Maybe there's a
better way; hopefully someone else will fill ya in on on that.  =)
