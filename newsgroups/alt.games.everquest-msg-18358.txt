Doctor as a shortened form of Medical Doctor is a very un-useful shortening.
Medicin is a young science, and it is disrespectful to all other scientists
that have earned the title of Doctor to automatically assume that it only
means Medical Doctor.  This is doubly true since all the older titles that
use Doctor have been devalued in favor of Medical Doctor.

I do not see how Light Bird is useful either.  It is more derogetory than
the full title.  Then again, they also call the achiving the nexr rank as
getting the Silver Chicken, and they also say, "They are giving him The
Bird."  Which is usually acompanied by a snicker.

For some reason calling an instructor "teach" also failes to seem useful to
me.

I say S C S I, not scuzzy.  Most people say scuzzy.

So we have one useful one out of five.

Or perhaps it is just humans being humans.  English is the most changed
language that is still used today.  There are several letters and
pronunciations that are no longer in english.  Multiple negatives used to
mean increased negativity, so "Never no more" was a strong negative.
Chaucer used as many as five or six negatives in his most ectreme cases.

What kind of word is "dunno?"

As for some of your original examples, I think you had GNM, and things like
that in there.  Those are used in game.  Just right click and hold on any
item in your inventory.  There are shortened forms right there.  Some of the
people use those forms, or a phonetic version of them.  Others use different
shortened forms.  When you get used to useing these, they are faster to
type.  Yes, there is also the cute or fun aspect.  Isn't this a game?

> Ebonics annoy me too, I might add.

What about what is commonly called "Southern" speech, "Valley Talk," and the
ever so popular "Italian Mob Talk?"  Fuhgetta boutit.  There are more.
Jargon and slang are common in every walk of life.  The electronic community
known as EQ reflects this.
