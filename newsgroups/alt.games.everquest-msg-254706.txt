It's pretty rich for a newbie zone though. You get a few LQ and MQ
bear pelts and the occasional HQ pelt just for leveling up to 5. Also
spiderling silk, but you can get that in some other newbie zones. The
white bear pelts net you about 2 to 3pp and nice faction when you turn
them in. (Assuming you don't use them for newbie armor.)

This is all nice, particularly as you really don't miss the exp at
that level.
