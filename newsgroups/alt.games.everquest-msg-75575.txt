No, I don't but let me correct a misconception, many people have said this
item may have been "planted" by a high level character (if you hand a FS
scimitar to an orc pawn, it will be there when you kill him nice way to
surprise some newbie. I personally don't do this because so many people
leave corpses unlooted)

This is not the case, because while playing a level 9 character, I saw 3 of
these drop, noone else but my group was around, and we watched the orc spawn
and killed it in under 30 second, so no plants.

Here's what I'd like to think: Verant sympathizes with the plight of a real
newbie and has added this item to give them an early source of cash. (who
knows).
