The Trade Commissioner quest basically rewards you with a necklace
that when worn affords you the best deals possible with the local
merchants. I have actually had a couple of characters who most of the
locals would not even deal with until I completed this quest.

It starts at the Trade Commissioner (Commissioner so-and-so) in the
building to the right just before you get on the bridge going from
Shadow Haven to Paludal Caverns.
