Am in a fairly small but high level guild (usually 3 groups of 65's, 4
clerics).  We still use rolling or just talk about who gets what if it is
not urgent to sort it straight away.

I hate the informality of DKP but I also hate the randomness of NBG /
Rolling for loot.

We stil use /ran for lack of a better system.
