What you offer the group is damage output.  Example: my Monk was level
6, grouped with my friend's level 6 Wood Elf Bard.  We let a level 6
Wood Elf Druid into our group in Misty Thicket.  We taught him how to
use Harmony (he did not know what the spell was for).  We went to work
on the Goblin camps.  We all were somewhat experienced with other
characters (I've got a 37 Wizard, my Bard friend has a 54 Cleric, and
the Druid told us he has a 20ish Cleric).  The Monk is totally
non-twinked (different server from my other characters), the Bard was
twinked a little with some money from a friend from work who plays on
that server to buy songs, and the Druid was twinked quite a bit.

We played for about 4 bubbles worth of XP.  In that time, we killed 98
mobs, 95 of which gave XP (the other 3 were greens that aggroed).  We
produced 11595 points of melee damage, and the mobs hit us for 3609
points.  Here's how the melee damage broke down:

	Druid       3642 melee output,      1210 melee taken
	Bard        2929 melee output,      1366 melee taken
	Monk        5024 melee output,      1033 melee taken

The Monk was using just his fists and round kick.  About 25% of the
Monk's damage output came from round kick.  I don't know how much
damage the Bard was doing with songs and the Druid with spells, but the
Monk definitely was pulling his weight.
