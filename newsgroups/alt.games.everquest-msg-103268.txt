So now you have started to separate physical dependence from
psychological dependence.  Physical dependence is created over time, but
psychological dependence for some people is acquired very quickly.  One
exposure to a chemically induced psychological reaction can be enough to
plant the seeds for  those predisposed to a great enough degree.  This
applies to  alcohol the same as crack as far as the psychological
dependence, oh and blueberry cheesecake as well. /twitch  Psychological
dependence is much harder to deal with than physical hehe, I haven't had
blueberry cheesecake in years but I still feel the  pull <G>.

 Like I said the other day you may want to read  up on the subject a
bit, obviously if you are carrying on this discussion you have an
interest, might as well be well informed.
