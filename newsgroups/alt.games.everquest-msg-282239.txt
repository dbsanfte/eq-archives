unreasonable? :)

I have an ooc macroed,if someone does a campcheck:
/ooc EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING from Champion Kamak
 to the Iksar Golem camped by ME !!!  :)

Takes me around 35 minutes to do a run on all nameds/phs in this
area.

Note the smiley at the end of the ooc.

I just love Veksar,nice layout,almost everything comes single(except
shop),very nice loot(Words of Agony!),some AA xp(around 1 AA in 
2 hours),and I can melee them,which makes the killing sooo much
faster.
It has become somewhat popular to my surprise in the last months
on my server,half a year ago I was alone everytime I went there,now
it is not unusual to see 5 or so people around,but they are mostly
doing the Highborn/Nobles area,I wonder why,xp from the mobs 
there is really bad compared to their difficulty(Harmtouch for almost
1k,summon,20k hps),and yes I know they drop the 15k Tribute gloves,
but I spent there whole evenings with small groups without seeing
them.
