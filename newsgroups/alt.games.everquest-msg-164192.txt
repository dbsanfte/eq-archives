SD is a mez song, and a darned nice one.  It re-mezzes your
target every pulse, so even if it breaks between the last
pulse and the current one, it gets reapplied quickly (unless
you get smacked so hard it interrupts your song).

It's one of my "always memmed" songs.

I'm not sure if using a Wind instrument increases its
effectiveness somehow, but you can use it just fine
with no Wind instrument equipped, which is quite handy.

It also does a bit of a "knockback" every time it pulses,
which is handy too if you want to "steer" a mob someplace.
The "push" isn't actually "away from you", it's in whatever
direction you're facing.  So you can pull a mob out of a
wall by firing up this song then turning your back on the mob.

Another nice side-effect of the "push" is that after
several pulses, the mob is far enough away that even if
mez breaks and it makes a run at you, you'll likely re-mez
it with another pulse before it reaches you.  The downside
is that you can shove it far enough away that you get a
"your target is out of range" message and your song will
stop.  But the range on the song is pretty far, so this
doesn't happen often.  Just don't plan to fire up the mez
and go afk.

It also interrupts any spellcasting the mob might be
doing when it pulses, so it's nice for keeping healing mobs
from self-healing, or wizard mobs from chain-nuking (e.g.,
play this even when your group is continuously smacking the
mob -- it won't stay mezzed, but you'll get in a spell
interrupt every 6 seconds).

It was actually added somewhat out of the blue, it wasn't
part of any expansion.  A patch a few months ago just mentioned
that it was suddenly available, go figure.
