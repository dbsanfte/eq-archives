     Still wouldn't catch a lot of the issues they have, and you still have
to decide what "better" means.

    For example, the Twig was put in **by a developer** who simply didn't
understand the mainhand damage bonus. He thought it would be a neat toy for
aggro. The same mistake happened in PoSky (2/6 knight sword, 3/10 1HB), the
same mistake had happened in Beta (bixies used to drop a sub-10 delay
stinger), the same mistake would have continued to happen if they hadn't put
the "damage bonus" field on weapons. Some sarcastic wags even suggested when
that came out that it was done more for the devs than for the players. ;-)
