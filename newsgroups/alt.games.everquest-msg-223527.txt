I have first hand recent knowledge that this still happens . In a collect 30
we killed 149 mobs before we finnished. There where only 150 mobs total .
Took 87 minutes and gained and aa and a half not to mention a single person
cash split of 466 pp.

Worst assasinate I have seen was the long distance flesh of osorous. Failed
long before we got anywhere near him . Miragul has a linear design and one
of the 2 posistions is downstairs in the basement at the very end of the
possible places he can spawn. On the bright side I know that layout
completely now. Was a hard adventure so didnt feel to bad but has kept me
from doing anything but slaughters if doing hard now.

Never had a problem with slaughters or rescues. If your are in an iffy group
there is a good reason to gamble on collects I guess , they could be the
easist if you flip that figurative lucky coin but you will guarantee some
losses to.

Miragul is dangerous from traps, deepest guk is dangerous from mob hiding, I
find that overall mistmoor, takish, and rujark are the easiest.
