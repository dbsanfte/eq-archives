I've had that combo so often I can't count.  While grouping my BL and 
mage to level the BL I log on a 65 cleric and virtue us - and keep XPG up
as well.

Consider the data from lucy at the bottom of this post.  The phantom armor
line up to the 54 one have AC in slot 4 and it is lower than the AC from 
ShoW in the same slot, which is why ShoW overwrote it.

TPP/XPG do *not* have an ac component.  In fact they have no shared effect
with temp/aego/virtue.

I've never tried to have ShoW with TPP/XPG, but I don't see why it would
overwrite as there are no common effects to cause it to.

ShoW is
4:  increase AC by 31

Phantom Armor (52)
2:  Increase Hitpoints by 5 per tick 
4:  Increase AC by 21 (L52) to 22 (L60) 

Phantasmal Armor
2:  Increase Hitpoints by 5 per tick 
4:  Increase AC by 21 (L54) to 22 (L60) 

TPP is
2:  Increase Hitpoints by 5 per tick 
4:  Increase Mana by 4 per tick 
8:  Increase AC by 23 (L58) to 25 (L65) 

XPG is
2:  Increase Hitpoints by 5 per tick 
4:  Increase Mana by 6 per tick 
8:  Increase AC by 40 (L62) to 42 (L65) 

Temp is
1:  Stacking: Block new spell if slot 3 is effect 'Max Hitpoints' and < 
1100 
2:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 800 
3:  Increase HP when cast by 800 
4:  Increase AC by 48 
5:  Stacking: Overwrite existing spell if slot 3 is effect 'Max Hitpoints' 
and < 1100 

Aego is
1:  Stacking: Block new spell if slot 3 is effect 'Max Hitpoints' and < 
1100 
2:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 1100 
3:  Increase HP when cast by 1100 
4:  Increase AC by 54 
5:  Stacking: Overwrite existing spell if slot 3 is effect 'Max Hitpoints' 
and < 1100 

Virtue is
1:  Stacking: Block new spell if slot 3 is effect 'Max Hitpoints' and < 
1405 
2:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 1405 
3:  Increase HP when cast by 1405 
4:  Increase AC by 72 
5:  Stacking: Overwrite existing spell if slot 3 is effect 'Max Hitpoints' 
and < 1405
