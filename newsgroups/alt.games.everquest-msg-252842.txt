If they're that red now, they'll be viable xp targets for a longish 
time. Particularly for the soloing chanter.

So add roots :) Its not like its going to turn on you.... its a running 
mob afterall.

He's effectively using the gaurd as a comparatively unkillable 
stationary pet that will not obey commands, and will not aggro you, that 
is much much higher level than him.

I doubt this is an intended use of guard npcs, so i call it an exploit.

To be fair I've used it myself to kill Grimfeather and the Silver 
Griffon; using the gaurds to soften them up a bit first. But in that 
case the mob is still a dangerous adversary after the gaurds drop so its 
'less safe'. But I suppose you could use the technique to kill wolves, 
and what not in EK...

I'm unconvinced its legitimate; and I strongly suspect that if it were 
ever to be found to be very efficient it would promptly be nerfed.

Your right its not 100% safe. But since he only has to do <20% damage to 
the mob, would it be fair to say its 85% an exploit =).

Quite possibly. But as I said earlier, being inefficient doesn't make it 
legitimate.

And we're all sort of half-expecting for the nerf bat to come down on 
bard swarm kiting too. :)
