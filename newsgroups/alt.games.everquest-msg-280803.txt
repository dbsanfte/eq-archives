When LDoN was new, this was true for a lot of groups.  As a L65 enchanter with
~3500 HP buffed, I could reliably mez a double-pull ONLY because we had a
near-perfect group to back me up.  Three mobs or bad resists caused a wipe.
We were fast at recovery, so we could still win even after a wipe, sometimes
after two.  Damn, those were fun times.  And there were AMAZING pets when
they didn't wipe us.  Risk vs reward was a real topic of discussion in the
group over that :)

Even when it was new, I sometimes grouped with hardcore raiders who simply had
no problem with them.  It was nice because I always got to charm, but kinda
boring because there was no real risk of failure - they'd honestly be able to
finish without me.

Nowadays, I'd say the groups of L65-70 that struggle in WoS probably need a
bard or FD puller in LDoN, but they can do it.  The groups that do well in
MPG or RSS can easily handle LDoN with "just" an enchanter, or even some other
class to root park adds if they're careful.

It's easy to forget just how wide the range of power level the game has, even
for groups of similar level.
