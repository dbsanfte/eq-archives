I didn't buy it either, and I've skipped DON, after buying OOW and 
barely playing in it at all.  I'm simply not interested in the high 
level content of EQ, I get to a point where I just chuck it all and 
start over.

Early reports from my son (who at this point is playing a lot more than 
I am, I'm busy making swords) are that the monster missions can be run 
by anyone, from level 1 to 70 apparantly; what happens is you basically 
start a very temporary alt "monster", go out and run a task, gather exp 
and loot which then is applied to your actual character.

I'm not saying its necessarily good content, but it looks like there is 
at least something for everyone in that.
