Hello all!

As we all well know Sony as been getting money since Everquest first
launched and are rakeing in millions every month, but they have yet to do
anything worth while with their money that they have "STOLEN" from us. Why
continue to give them money if they dont use it to evolve the game? Insted
they are using  your money to pay for their subscription to porn sites. So
they can all be happen and have a circle jerk in the office while playing EQ
and doing what they call "Customer support". This has to come to an end.
RIGHTNOW!
