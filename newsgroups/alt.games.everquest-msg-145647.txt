No.

The skin is just that: a skin. A covering. You cannot actually change
any actions. You're actually very very limited in what you can/cannot do
in the UI. For example, many of the windows are hardcoded to include
specific elements - eg: you MUST include the join/disband buttons in the
grouping window. You can move them out of the visual window, or make
them too small to see, but you can't totally remove them.

If you could set up keys into chains or cycles, too much of the game
would become trivial. Lockpick, sense heading, hide, sneak, even
specialisation changes or faction farming, would become simply a matter
of sleeping while your cycle does all the work.

I don't see it happening, personally


BTW, what exactly were you wanting to do?
