    You missed my question. The one reason I could see Verant not allowing
self-porting with Translocates is if the appropriate Translocate spell was
cheaper and/or faster to cast than the same location Gate spell. Is this the
case? Is vanilla Tranlocate faster/cheaper than Gate? Is Translocate:Tox
faster/cheaper than Portal:Tox? Etc....
