Okay, dumb question, but is that because gems generally keep their
resale value when you sell them back to a vendor?  

It always seemed to me that if, for instance, you bought a spell from
a vendor for 1 gold and realized you already had that spell and went
to sell it back to the vendor, the vendor would only offer you 5
silver for it or something.  If you had 100 pp you wanted to transfer
to another character, could you buy gems, transfer the gems to your
new character and the new character could resell the gems and still
get 100 pp (or close to it)?  Or does your new character have to go to
the Bazaar and set up shop there and sell them to other players?
