I hope you don't ever post against twinking with a statement like that hehe.
Being a Paladin, and just that sort of person anyway, I will try and help
anyone that politely asks me, and I check they are a newbie and are not
twinked (most twinks never seem to bother me anyway I find).  I myself have
only recently started playing and although I only have one character, most
people ask me whether I am a twink because of the gear that high lvl chars
have given me out of their generosity, and I have never begged.  So I try
and return the generosity that was shown to me, and I find it can be much
more rewarding in terms of satisfaction.  Of course, there are times that I
cannot help either, and I am never afraid to say 'no' if I have to.
