Interesting that you find it rude ignoring them. I find it rude that a
complete stranger should be sending you tells asking for things. I cant be
bothered having to type out a response everytime im begged, and I dont see
why I should have to.

Actually I dont mind it too much if I get a tell "Want to do a port to wc
for 20p?", but some seem to make a point of trying to waste your time...
"Can you help me?". Sheesh.. with what? Is this a guessing game or
something. Or the other old favourite... "Are you a druid?". The one that
irritates me the most however is a tell "Hello friend" from someone ive
never heard before, later to find out they just want a port (usually free
when they try this line), and im no friend at all.
