This works if there's a lull between kills

Otherwise there are a number of things that
destroy the increase in DPS, namely

1.  time to suspend/unsuspend pet
2.  10 second cast time on fire pet
3.  fire pet will buff itself before
    attacking.

So, if you have the 20-25 or so seconds between
each kill to micro manage the CoR, then it's
a viable strategy, otherwise stick with SoM and
just make sure it's on the back.

I love pet discipline, it was the first class AA I got for my mage
and 2nd to Paragon on my BL.
