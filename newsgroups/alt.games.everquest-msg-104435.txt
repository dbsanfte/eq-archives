This has happened to a ranger and at least one druid in our guild. I'm
not sure about the druid(s), but the ranger had NO aggro. They weren't
kiting the PoGs or buffing anyone. They were just sitting around
chatting for a bit.

Possible.

No clue if this would give a faction hit without message or not. Both
the ranger and druid did receive faction messages, though.

The druid was a bit of a flake. We noticed they had somehow obtained
aggro and told them, yet they refused to camp/gate. Boink, faction
hit. Next mob, another faction hit. They received faction messages
both times, but just wouldn't clear aggro.

I think PoG is just bugged.
