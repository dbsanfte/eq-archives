Stein of Moggok and a Harvester serve my 40 necro rather well. Steins
have kinda gone up in price since the Bazaar (I find that odd,
especially with PoP trivializing the quest so much), so I'm not sure
if that and the harvester will fit in your budget, though.

Grammar nitpicks: "wants" and "knows", not "want's" and "know's".
Apostrophes are used, with a few exceptions, only for contractions and
possessives.
