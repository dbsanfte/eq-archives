<rant about patch>

1. He sets up a trader PC overnight.
2. Verant brings down servers for a patch.
3. His trader PC is no longer logged in selling stuff.
4. His trader PC no longer make money until logged back in again.

Does that explain it for you?<<

Yeah, *you're* explanation makes sense.

His statement was kinda vague to me. I got the impression he felt a change
brought about in the patch was going to prevent people from leaving vendors
on all night.  Thanks for setting me straight.
