My opinion of why a Cleric wears plate is a simple...everything in EQ,
originally, is a rip off of D&D, the races, the classes, the lot.
Clerics can wear plate in D&D they can then wear plate in EQ.
The difference is the game since evolved, at the lower levels the game does
play like D&D, Warriors are tough and everyone melee's a bit, as it gets
higher the game then becomes itself no longer is it D&D, it is now EQ,
Warriors are damage takers, Rogues are the damage dealers and Clerics don't
melee.
I don't believe it was a "vision" of what the Cleric should be, it's just
how the class evolved with the game.
Besides that, I want the caster that's responsible for keeping me alive
while something 4 times my size tries to use me as a tent peg to be able to
take a bit of punishment when things get rough.
