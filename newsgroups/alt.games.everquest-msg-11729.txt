Rangers are not generally considered a primary tank class, although they
hacve decent AC and HP they are generally a chain armour class which
effectively prevents them from achieving anything like the higher AC that a
plate wearing class is capable of. Their HP, also, whilst being decent is
not on anywhere near that of a main tank class like a warrior or to a lesser
extent other plate wearers such as Shadow Knights and Paladins.

The ranger really shines in the use of fast 1hs proccing weapons, in general
they tend to have a high dexterity which allows weapon spells to proc more
regularly. Unfortunately this fast damage potential can have some further
drawbacks for a ranger as it tends to have a huge taunting effect on
creatures that they fight who will often turn their attention to the ranger
in a group and ignore the primary tank in favour of them.

Of course, as Rangers are not intended to play the main tank roll for
extended periods, it can leave a group healer in the position of having to
mana dump on Rangers to keep them alive, and can make it difficult to play a
ranger at higher levels,  though not impossible. Spells have been put in for
the hgher level game where these deficiencies really start to make
themselves apparent, to try and make up for the problems by lowering a
Rangers place on a creatures hatelist but there have been mixed reactions
from the ranger community on their value.

A ranger does have other skills and abilities to bring to a group, tracking,
snares, a few buffs, some nuking ability and a modest amount of healing, all
things that potentially have to be considered in deciding to play the class.

Good luck making a decision. =)
