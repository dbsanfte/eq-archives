No but it is the most glaring example.

Lionskin glove quest.
Shakey scarecrow's head quest <<< STILL BROKEN!
Shakey's stuffing quest, was working then it was broken for along time before being fixed.
Several trade skill recipes, some of which are STILL BROKEN!
Fabian bard quest.
Fleshy orb quest.
Squad ring quest charging.
Monk sash was working then it was broken for along time before being fixed.

Shall I go on? All these things were broken for a long time
or are still broken.
