Once you get to this level fear kiting isn't the best method anyway.

Agro kiting is more effective and just as safe and you can control the
pathing then.
You can practise that and still get XP from the ravens in PoN at your level.

Also pet tanking works against undead. Try going to veksar and using your
pet
to tank the undead just above the ramp from where the goblins are near the
entrance. You'll need to use shadowbond on the pet all the time to keep it's
health up and be certain to use shackle or spirit on the undead to slow them
by
about 70%. Then use vexing to get back the health you'll be losing. It's
very easy
in veksar once you get the hang of it.
