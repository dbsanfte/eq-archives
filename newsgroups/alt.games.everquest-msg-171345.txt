I have a problem. My main is a 46 druid. I am on karana server and have a
very hard time finding a group. I use an acryila tunic for armour and really
want something for better ac. Problem is Elysian armour is hard to get to
and along with the kael armour drops, most of the mobs are red to me. I have
heard that the planal armour is great but is for 60+ toons. I am not 60+.
Anyone have any suggestions on better armour? I have been workin on
tailoring for the tunarian soldiers armour, wood elf only but my sticking
point is celestial essence which i cant make and sells for over 1000pp per
dose. Would someone please help in suggestions. I have tried to adventure
into velks and have to solo one mob then zone, seems no one wants a 46 druid
to group.
