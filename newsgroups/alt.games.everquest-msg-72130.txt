Dont know the time on ports from nexus to Norrath, but the announced 15 
min from norrath to nexus is bull.

Tried to time the messages from the mystic voice. In Dreadlands, it take 
27 min from the shout of 15 min to port, to the shout of 5 min left.
Cant remember my result from 5 min to port, but i would estimate the 
total time from 1 port to the next to be aroudn 40 min, not 15.
