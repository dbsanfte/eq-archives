You're okay as far as your fatigue bar is concerned, but seriously, you 
need to work on that stamina.  You're a tank, you need as many HPs (stamina 
contributes to HPs) as you can get and as much AC.  Think about it this 
way: a cleric will be casting complete heals on you at this level.  That 
complete heal is going to eat just as much of that cleric's mana if you 
have 7500 HPs that need healing or if you have 1500.

Getting back to the original question, I'd look into getting a Lamentation.  
They should be incredibly common in the bazaar with a lot of people 
upgrading from it in PoP, which means they'll be incredibly cheap.  Nice 
fast delay for a warrior, and will add a nice ammount of HPs.
