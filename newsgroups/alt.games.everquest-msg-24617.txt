Yeah, I love those. My Monk has a pair. Looking at some high level equipment
lists, I see that a lot of casters 50-60 have them as well. I can see why...it
certainly seems more efficient to have two rings giving 12 ac and 130 hp than
~12 int total.

Any suggestions out there for specific gear?
so far, of course, on my list I have the Veliu m Fire Wedding rings. Any
suggestions for a good robe? My 'chanter has to look sexy as well as have good
stats =P...I was thinking perhaps Crystalline Robes, which look great and would
leave me with plenty of leftover plat to buy other quality items. Thanks for
any and all suggestions/tips
