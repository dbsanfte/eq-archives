For a Dwarf Warrior, 51 to 52 takes roughly 21.5 million experience points.

54 to 55 takes roughly 41.5 million experience points.  So... almost twice as
bad.

And take a glance at 59 while you're there....  Just over 58 million
experience points needed to get 60.

All three of those are counting the warrior 10% class bonus. : P~



> Where'd you hear about the 51 to 52?

It was posted here several times.   I don't remember if it was on castersrealm
or someplace like that or not.  (and honestly I'm a bit too tired to go look
right now.)

I heard this before the patch message that said they were changing the amount
it required, so I'm not sure exactly how accurate it is at the moment.
