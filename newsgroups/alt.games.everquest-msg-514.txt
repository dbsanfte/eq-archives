Yes, very very annoying, isn't it?  Best I can say is try to get 
some clues from the audio.  I've only met blindness-casting mobs 
once so far (lizards in Feerrott, the ogre newbie area) and I'm 
not looking forward to meeting more such!  Heh, first time it 
happened I thought it was a bug, nearly rebooted the machine 
before it faded.

Clinging Darkness both does damage over time, and it DOES slow 
the mob down.  This was quite apparent to me when my necro was 
fighting the island lizards in Feerrott - they are fast little 
buggers, and the slowdown when clinging stuck on them was 
noticable.

When you discover kiting, you'll find out why clinging is so 
useful.
