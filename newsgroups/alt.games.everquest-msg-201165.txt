While I mostly agree, I also have to say I think you've been incredibly
lucky.

The most amusing training attempt was in Karnors (a place known for its
trains anyway).  I was level 60 at the time (a monk) and was solo grinding
experience there.  I see this guy run around collecting mobs, I mean a *lot*
of mobs, and then he came directly to me...  and feigned...  and so did I...

Dumbass.  Training a monk successfully is rather difficult.  For another
monk to not realize this was the height of ignorance.  We were both just
lying there for a while as the mobs wandered off and I asked him what it was
he was trying to accomplish.  Not surprisingly, he never answered.  :)
