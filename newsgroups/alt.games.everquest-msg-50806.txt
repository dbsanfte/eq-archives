Yeah you will be scowl pretty much no matter how many outdoor giants
you kill so don't even bother killing them to try to raise cov. Only a
raid on kael will help and if you have killed a ton of outdoor giants
or zero its the same thing; the first raid should at least get you to
glower dubious or above. Outdoor giants are just very small factions
as far as cov is concerned while kael is pretty huge. Basically just
being in some arena group(s)  for a few hours would get you non kos.

Its not a case of "numbers needed" or quantity, but rather a case of
quality. Your 163 outdoor faction hits did nothing but something like
20 or less around the arena will probably make you non kos.
