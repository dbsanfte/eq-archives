Well, she did, on April 1st.  following is a copy of the text.  Note the
last line of her post.

Add a "me too" here. From the time I first got involved in BBSs (which
was something a 'real life' friend introduced to me), I've had friends
whom I'd not met. All my current friends (barring my SO) are people I
now know in person, but that I first met on-line.

The beauty of this was that I met the *person* first - their opinions,
their personality, their ideas, before I ever saw their face. Heck, a
couple of them I'd have made a point to avoid had I seen them in
person first. An important lesson in that.

Then, as you say, at work. In the nine years I worked customer
support, I forged some excellent relationships and even became friends
with people I never met. I knew them, their families, what they liked,
and so on. Even exchanged tapes and reading recommendations with some
of the braver ones <g>.

Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
