I highly doubt that one.  People seem to forget theres TONS of monster
already in the game thats lvls are way up there.  Monsters that takes groups
to kill, some can even wipe out a few groups.  So theres monsters right
there would be good to help get for 60-70.
Plus the fact PoP will bound to have plenty of high lvl monsters, and then
maybe twinking of a few other higher lvl monsters to make them a bit harder
to kill.
Remember if they could do it in RoK they can do it in PoP, don't see why
people think's they couldn't do it.
