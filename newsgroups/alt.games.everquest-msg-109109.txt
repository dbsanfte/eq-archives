Ah yes...  The rantings of a person without a clue.  As many a poster here
has mentioned...  Bandwidth costs, the costs of operating a server farm
that houses 40+ EQ servers, which consists of a bank of possibly 20 to 50
computers to service the 150 or so zones that currently exist per EQ
server...  The power necessary to run said machines plus the customer
service computers at which the GMs sit behind to do the very things like
answering your petitions.  In all this, you neglect to take in the cost
that inflation and cost of living goes up a little each year to pay the
people behind keeping up the machines, coding them, running customer
service.  That whole reality thing just seems too inconvient to you.

Before complaining about GMs and Guides as far as answering petitions is
concern and equating cost to improved CS response time... Consider this.

You are 1 of over 1,000 people.  Of those 1,000 people abouy .5% of those
people petition on one case or another.  That is approximately 20
petitions.  The rough average petition, depending on the player's response
and the Guide's response back can vary between 5 to 20 minutes, depending
on the severity of the petition and the petitioner in question.  This
means, even with say, 6 or 7 guides running around answering petitions, it
does not guarentee your petition will be answered right away, because you
could be Petition #21 or higher, not Petition #1 that they just picked up.

Another thing to consider... Guides, as mentioned on the Everquest Live
Webpage, are Players who volunteer their time to assist the GM in such matt
er.  Guides are players volunteering their time to be assistants to the GM,
they are NOT Verant Employees.  They cannot get any better than they are
because they aren't given no special information about quests, they have to
find out for themselves though other means or from other players.  They are
also not given any special powers that allow them to spawn something, or
kick a person off on a whim, or ban a person.  They are given enough powers
to look into something and prioritize petitions on the situation for the GM
to come over and smack someone if it is bad enough.

Before posting again...  Research what you are ranting about sometime.
