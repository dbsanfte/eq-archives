My main char got stuck when trying to zone into the dreadlands once and I
was able to fix it by deleting all the dreadland files locally and then
running the thorough file check. The same thing has happened with an alt in
the warrens but I don't see any files locally called the warrens. What files
do I need to delete for the warrens to fix this?

Thanks
