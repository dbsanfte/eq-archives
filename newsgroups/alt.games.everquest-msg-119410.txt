LOL.  Nothing is funnier than to see absurd, supposed rules of conduct
violations like this posted.

What do you mean by "exploiting"?  If you're claiming that running a mob
you can't handle to a guard rather than dying is exploitation, then every
player of a barbarian warrior in this game would be banned. And Bandl
McMarrin would be very bored.

This assertion made me curious enough to check out the rules of conduct at

http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp

which (of course) said nothing about "guard exploitation".

Encouraged in my effort to expose this claim as the hogwash that it is, I
went to the Everquest Manual, and found this on page 77
(http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/images/EQTrilogyManual.pdf):

"Luring (Zones andGuards) A well-known tip among EverQuest players is to
lure monsters into a  safer  area and fight them there. A ranged attack
can often draw a creature toward you. Try to fight near a zone boundary,
or near a guard. If you get into trouble and need a quick solution, you
can simply run toward either one."

It seems that the very thing you're claiming to be cause for "disciplinary
action" is instead recommended strategy.

So don't be scared, Lance.  Keep exploit'n them guards.

And TwoHead, I suggest you pull at least one of them out of your butt ...
