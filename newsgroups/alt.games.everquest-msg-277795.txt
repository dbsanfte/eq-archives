One of my characters has 235 charisma with her gear.
I tried to see how charisma affect merchant to offer price when I sell.
And I found it doesn't make any difference charisma 235 and 125(without her
gear).
Why is that so?
I created this character to help my evil main character's bank.
Anyone can explain me about this,please?
