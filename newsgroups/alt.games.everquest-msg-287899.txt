Actually I have followed it for quite a while and it was just released
in europe earlier this year and just a month ago in this country. In
fact they were in the process of combining the US and European servers
as I was trying the game. This tells me that they have not got the
customer base to support seperae server facilities for each group.

On the US server I only saw a handfull of people in the general chat
but that is not an indicator of acceptance. I am sorry for the
developers who probably put a lot of personal time investment into
this game..... but it's clearly sub standard for what they are
charging for the client side software and for the subscription peice
for the game.

You are right though, development did start about 8 years ago. As it
was a private effort with obvious funding problems it took much longer
to produce than some of the more mainstream offerings lately.
