 Not sure on drops and such, but if you set up camp anywhere between
Dawnshroud and Akheva, expect to be trained. 

 Akheva zone isn't bad but watch out for the 4-armed mobs and the
ghosts. The have some nasty HT and depending on your HP, 3 will probably
kill you. On the way by the other day I got a HT for 911. Which I find a
bit excessive but hey, Verant knows best.
