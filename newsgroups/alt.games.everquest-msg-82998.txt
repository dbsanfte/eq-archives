The focus items - stein, torch, shovel, broom - don't do anything
for your pets after 50.  They're fine until then.   There are higher
level focus items - Staff of Elemental Mastery (Fire/etc) but
you can't get them at your level.   Some drop in the planes, IIRC.

The definite mage site, AFAIK:

www.magecompendium.com

Pet statistics, quests, etc.   The Staffs of Elemental Mastery are
all part of the epic, BTW, as are the lower-level focus items.
Essentially you'll hang onto them until you get the higher-level
ones, if you ever do.
