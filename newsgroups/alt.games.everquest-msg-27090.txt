NO, but the rules say, that is how it works.  And those rules, ARE
WRITTEN.

Do I like those rules, sometimes.  Do I use them, Not usually.  If some
moron is pharming the SBS in Crush, and he's carrying one, and he's not
getting Xp for the kills, then Yup, I'll pull PNP out of my pocket and
smack him with it.
