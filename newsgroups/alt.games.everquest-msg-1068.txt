He's talking about how XP penalties affect others in the group.  Verant
has said XP will be split based on level after the patch.  They have not
given enough information for us to tell what this means.  Here are three
possibilities:

1. Your share is your_level / sum( levels_of_all_group_members ).

2. Your share is your_level^3 / sum( levels_of_all_group_members^3 ).

3. The share will be calculated in a very complicated way, by figuring
your "class share" using #1 or #2, and your "race share", using a
forumula like the current formula.  The race share and class share will
be combined somehow to get your overall share.

Time to download ShowEQ and get some test groups together!
