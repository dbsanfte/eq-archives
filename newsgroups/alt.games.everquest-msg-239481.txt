i'm gonna be honest with you people: i am a newb.  there, i said it NEWB,
NEWB, NEWB!  anywho...those of you who read my other post know that i am
interested in the crown of deceit, but when i went to a site to find out who
to talk to and what i needed to do for the quest, it said the suggested
level was like 55 or something!  i'm like "what the hell!" anyway, is this
true or can a level 12 necro do the quest?  do you think someone would help
me if i asked somewhere like pok?
