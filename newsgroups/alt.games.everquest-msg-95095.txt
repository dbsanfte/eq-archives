Their may be many druids out there in peoples accounts, but I don't know
what the level/class statistics are. I would bet that at higher levels the
proportion of druids drops substantially. I know several druids who have
just hung it up around level 50 and just use the druid for special
occasions, crafting, PL'ing alts, etc. One only needs read this board awhile
to build a list of comments, half  of which saying how useless druids are in
groups, and the other half screaming about idiot druid soloers - sometimes
from the same poster.

I really don't want any bumps to the class. I'd be pretty happy if the just
opened Luclin ports so that my druid could excersise one of the abilities
his class is supposed to have - but has been denied in 25% of the world. As
far as bumps, making some druid buffs stackable with Shaman/Cleric buffs
wouldn't exactly make them "gods", but would at least make them useful in
groups at higher levels.

No one said anything about group "god", I just get tired of hearing all this
crap about how druids need to be nerfed because they are "too powerful". Or
that you shouldn't expect to group if you're a druid and then get pissed on
for soloing.

Imagine the wails and moans if the put "soul rezzers" in 30 zones, or made
taunting impossible in a dozen zones, or eliminated FD and pets in a whole
continent. Yet when they create 30 zones with no ports and are full of
un-snarable highly MR MOBs, all druids can expect is "Welcome to my world".
