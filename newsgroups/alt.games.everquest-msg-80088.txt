In theory you can get by without buying the game. Currently i'm out of 
the time period but now properly subscribed. Also not sure if was a bug 
but I always was on the main servers, which suited me fine ;)

That said buying the trilogy is definitely the way to go now (want to 
change my chat screen background, I can never view the chat properly and 
for that I need one of the add ons). So as you say it would make sense 
if he enjoyed the game. Game rocks for me - quite surprised myself.
