Interfering in worldwide processes for their benefit is becoming 
mother's milk to them.  They tried to get some of their agenda into the 
Patriot Act as well...though they did not succeed in that case.  

Another cute thing in the S-DMCA...the one-sided litigation clause.  If 
they come after you and you lose, you have to pay their legal fees.  But 
if they lose, they don't have to pay your legal fees.  O.o	  

I'll shut up now...no good getting pissy first thing in the morning.
