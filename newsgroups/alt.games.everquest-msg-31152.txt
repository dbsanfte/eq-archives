Looks like you got a bunch off apprentice hot shots who think they know
everything and really know nothing.  Anyone with an ounce of sense would be
happy to have an enchanter in a group.  I suspect that with a lot of these
new players classes like enchanters and even druids are too subtle for them
to understand or deal with, or that they are too young and inexperienced to
get beyond the bash and nuke aspects of the game.  Hopefully, most of them
will wander somewhere else soon and we will no longer be troubled by them.

Of course if you had wanted to you could have given the fellow who hated
enchanters a real reason to hate the class and offered to duel him and the
charmed him into the biggest pack of orcs available and quietly watched
while the cut him to pieces.  Of course then he would have been yelling
about how you cheated and did not fight fair.
