No, it's not at all like that.  It's a standard fantasy-based MMORPG
set in Tolkien's world, at roughly the time of the hobbits travelling
from the Shire to Rivendell.  Players can solo or form "fellowships"
(groups) to do quests, tradeskills, and so on.  Many of the quests
are linked to the story line in some way, such as killing wild beasts
and gradually finding evidence that the reason there's so many of them
is because of dark forces driving them mad, etc.

There are a lot of ways in which having an appreciation of the books
enhances the game, but it's not required.  For instance, there's a
game effect called "dread" that acts like a debuff, lowering your HP
and mana (called morale and power in LOTRO) and in extreme cases
making it impossible to act.  You encounter Dread when facing various
undead (especially bosses), and in certain locations, and you can tell
when you're running into it because the screen wavers slightly as the
feeling hits.  Well, you get hit by a small Dread effect as you walk
up to (or out from) the door of Elrond's "Last Homely House" in
Rivendell.  And if you look around, you'll find that it's because
Frodo (presumably with the Ring) is hanging out near the entrance.

Anyway, as was said, to each his own.  I find it a pleasant change of
pace, and a game where my wife and I can play together without either
of us having to PL through 70 levels of EQ or WOW just to group.
