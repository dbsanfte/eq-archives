Actually, I think it only involves the Felwithe pally guild according to the
walkthrough. All the NPCs involved should be on Truespirit faction (which
everyone starts off apprehensive to), so you should be able to talk to them.
Your problem will be dodging the good guys in Erudin, Halas and Felwithe.

Erudin shouldn't be a problem (there are no NPCs near Camin) and there is a
section in the walkthrough about dark races in Halas. Not sure about
Felwithe as I don't go there much and I haven't started my epic yet.
