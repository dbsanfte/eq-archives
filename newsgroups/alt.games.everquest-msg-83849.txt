So what is next? Money? Items?

Give-aways are a slippery slope. It creates a "Monster Customer" that
will never be satisfied and only expects more. It isn't CS. It is
appeasement.

Now Mythic is painted into a corner. Every time there is a glitch on
patch day, they will be expected to give exp for downtime. If they
don't then they will be slammed and blamed for poor CS.

I am not bitching about it Biz. I am pointing out that it lessens the
playing experience, and opens a pandoras box of trouble.

Customer Service is not about buying off customers or complainers. It
is about addressing issues and keeping your customers informed. It is
making sure the customer knows that you are doing your best you can
for them.

Any CS rep who's sole goal is to make people happy is in the wrong
line of work. Making people happy is a by-product of good CS, not the
mission.
