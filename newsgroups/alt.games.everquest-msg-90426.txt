Yeah, because EVERYBODY has a JBB.  And EVERYBODY
crits 100% with them.

I have two characters with Right-click nuke items, and to
be honest, I think giving somebody (anybody) critical nukes
off of an item is kinda lame in the first place.  After all, it's
not the "caster" doing the spell, it's the item.  The item
shouldn't get "better" at its job, no matter how suddenly
proficient the weilder is.  This does not mean that a
Mage can't hit harder with a staff at level 50 than level
2, but it does mean that just because he's now level 51 he
should all of the sudden find out his staff nukes for 450
instead of 333.  It's just a staff.
