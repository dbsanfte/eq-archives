I believe woody just went recently, but I haven't read anything about his
experiences. Anyuzer (well known on EQ2 boards anyhoo) also was invited
there over the summer. everyone of these people come back acting like they
are recovering from a) multiple orgasms, b) an acid trip, or c) heaven.  I
wasn't sure which comparison was more apt, but everyone just gushes about
Sigil.  ANd gamers don't gush like that. Soooo...I'm pretty sure they have
hired enchanters at Sigil and are performing something dastardly to
people they bring in.
