Good to see we're in agreement.  After all, you *can* roleplay in Quake.  I
was merely responding to your statement that this is the way it's "supposed"
to be.

I played *many* games online with other people long before EQ existed that
had absolutely zero roleplay aspect (again, you *could* roleplay in Quake). 
There's a huge grey area between "supposed to be" roleplaying and "wanking
off alone" that your statement seemed to be ignoring.

If you meant that that is why *you* play EQ instead of wanking off alone, I
apologize for misunderstanding.  :)
