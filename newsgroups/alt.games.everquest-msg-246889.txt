Well... I'd probably never commission an artist, but for buying anything 
on the net, I find being able to pay by CC/paypal convenient.  Less 
convenience = less reason not to go to the store down the street.  I don't 
see mailing them a check as any more secure... But I'd have to figure out 
where I hid the stamps and envelopes, and a pen, and walk to the PO box, 
so it's a lot less easy.
