When I was playing on test during the beta, I got a froglok charm from my
NPC trainer. I think I was only around level 4 at the time.

My lil froggie cleric on Rodcet is now level 10 and has done *ALL* the
newbie quests and I still haven't gotten the charm.

Did the charm make it over to the live servers? If so, did anyone happen to
get theirs?
