I too got a high score on the grief. 85%.  I answered *one* griefer
question slightly in the positive, about dominating other people, because
I tend to think of leading as dominating. How does that make me 85%
griefer?  Conversely, I answered every immersion question strongly to the 
positive, yet I was only 55% immersion.  I think the test is broken...

Maybe I'm just in denial.  Or better yet, I'm schizophrenic, and my dark
side has been busy KSing, scamming, and camp stealing. O_o

I usually like daedalus, but I think his test is broken this time.
