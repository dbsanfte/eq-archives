I used to play a game called "Real Life" which had the most incredibly
detailled character generation (human only) i have ever seen.I hope one day
that games like eq2 have that variability of form, so that you can be
overweight, or black, or have bad teeth for that matter. I like the way you
can often have aged characters now, or ones with piercings, but the lack of
departure from the anglo human model is kind of odd considering how popular
these games are internationally.
