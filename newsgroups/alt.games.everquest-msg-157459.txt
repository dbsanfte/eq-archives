Heh. My first werewolf was also in WC. I had just barely finished off
one of my first young kodiaks and was down to less than a bubble of
hp, when I turned around to see a werewolf bounding my way. A quick
right-click showing a nasty red con sent me exiting stage right at an
agonizingly-gimped rate, just barely getting out of his aggro range as
he passed me by.

Any game that can jack your heart rate up like that... :)
