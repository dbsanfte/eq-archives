Agreed. And we're seeing more and more of that in EQ and I think it's a
Good Thing (tm). One zone with that randomization factor built in is
City of Mist. Through the whole front sections of the city, until you
reach the goo areas, there are a bunch of spawn points that can pop any
one of a fair number of mob types, from plaguebones on up to fog golems.
And there are a bunch of nice items that can randomly drop here. Usually
wraithbone hammers, but also the rare Master Wu's Trance Stick or a
Green Jade Broadsword. But they can drop off of *any* mob at *any* of
the spawn points.

Now imagine that there was one particular mob off in one corner that we
knew dropped the monk stick, and he was the only one there who did. He'd
be camped 24/7. As it is, we don't have that problem there. Good coding.
