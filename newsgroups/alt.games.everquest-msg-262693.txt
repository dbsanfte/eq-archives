I just decided to go after the epic, being 64 (was 65 but died with no
cleric) none of the mobs has presented a problem but the spawn times
are horrid.  I think this was the reason I never attempted it before.

So I have all the sashes and headbands.  I have the code from Targin
the Rock but am now trying to get the code from Raster.  However, all
I have been able to glean is that it's an insanely long camp.

Does anyone have any tips or tricks to get him?  Is there a pattern or
timer?

Thanks.
