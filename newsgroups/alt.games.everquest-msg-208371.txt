Something is bolloxed.  My vah shir bard cannot log into skyfire.  When I
try it gives me the you have been disconnected message and kicks me back to
server select.  My dwarf cleric is in the same zone and can log in.  I've
also noticed that racial graphics are showing up old style (pre-luclin) even
though I have all the races checked on.  Last thing I did before problems
started was pre-order ldon.  Chat room is unavailable so I suspect I'm not
the only one with probs.  Does anyone have a solution?
