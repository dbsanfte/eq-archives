I agree and disagree. One thing that needs to be made clear: Instanced 
dungeons are not at fault here, and were not a mistake... the PoP zones 
could have been instanced for raid encounters and that wouldn't have 
significantly altered the game at all, except that the game could have 
multiple uberguilds raiding without raid collisions... and that's a good 
thing really.

Even lowbie/midlevel dungeons like The ToFS, Befallen, Kurns Tower, 
Kaesora, etc could all be instanced... and it wouldn't negatively impact 
the game.

LDoN does have a couple issues: the first being that there is no need to 
challenge yourself. You can take the easiest dungeons you can get, and 
get the same rewards as the difficult ones... it just takes a bit 
longer. That was a mistake.
