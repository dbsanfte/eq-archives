Indeed it will. An Erudite enchanter jeweler with high level charisma and
faction buffs will be able to purchase components much more cheaply than, say,
an ogre necromancer jeweler (yes, I've seen them.)

Exactly my point. The *ONLY* way to make a profit is by selling your goods to
other players, and character charisma makes no difference in such transactions.
Given the same selling price to players, the only difference charisma will make
is HOW MUCH profit you make. But then, the *quantity* of profit was not the
question. A character with a charisma of 45 (say, an ogre smith) will find that
it takes longer to make that profit, but profit can still be had if you are a
good salesman.
