This is exactly what you dont understand. We  dont view it as doing
nothing. If anything the 'action' of the XP grind is one of the most
tedious bits of EQ. The interesting parts were the significance of
choices, faction impact, consequences, (enforced) building of community
and relations with other players, positive or negative.

EQ 'the game' is ridiculous. It is nothing more than a pavlovian
button pressing exercise rewarded by the occasional DING. Who cares?

EQ 'the world' where you develop relations with interesting other
people, immersed in an environment that encourages that and provides
context and consequence for the roles  you assume is what gave it its
longevity for an awful lot of people. Nobody *cares* about beating
yet-another-grind-zone. Not even the raiding guilds - look at the
rants posted by those disbanding. They all bemoan a lack of significance,
of tedious cookie cutter design,in addition to broken mechanics.

The introduction of POK, of flags, of enforced linear gameplay and
isolated instanced zones with artificial time limits , a game where
one stage must be completed to engage in the next is what has turned
EQ from an open ended environment in which people entertained one
another into a very very very poor arcade game.

For engaging linear story half life *destroys* EQ. And EQ is increasingly
marginalising its only point; that of other people, players, to engage
with in an interesting and consequential fantasy environment.

By turning it into 'bite sized 6 person arcade chunks' it is turning
itself into just the mechanic of the game. And the mechanic of the
game, as you rightly pointed out, is pressing attack and waiting.

Big whoop.

Can you honestly say you could see EQ as being interesting enough in
its current mode to play for 5 years? A game reduced to a handful of
zones and 3 activities?
