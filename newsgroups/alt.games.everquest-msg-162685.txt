Its not as light sources that these are worth money.  The Lightstones are
a booby prize, you get a pp each for them.  The Burned Out Lightstones are
worse, they are there so you can't visually identify the wisps with
lightstones, and are used for really worthless practice research.

Greater Light Stones, however, are worth 7 to 10pp each; take one to one
of three gypsies and turn in for a concordance which you then sell for 7
to 9pp depending on charisma (heck, invest in a couple opal steins and get
your charisma up to 106, it will pay you back soon if you are doing this)

OR sell them to people who are trying to level up a character fast; at
lower levels the experience off this quest is great, its essentially the
next step after bone chips/CB Belts.  I wouldn't sell for less than 10pp,
since after all you can make almost that much doing the quest yourself,
and its really no trouble at level 22.
