Oh that's terrible advice! There are plenty of raids and quests that can be
done by 50s raid groups, in fact some of the old world dragons are actually
level-limited. Meanwhile the way for your guild to grow and learn, and to
attract more members, is to be actively grouping _both_ for exp groups and
for raids large and small.

Raiding isn't just about the reward, it's about the journey. After all we
play the game for the experience of it, right? (in the real-life sense, not
just the EQ sense, of "experience") And people get to know each other by
doing things together. Also people are best inspired to focus on levelling
up to the 60s by getting a taste of what the high-level content is like,
which you can start to get in the low 50s (or even high 40s if you're a
cleric ;-).

I'm not the expert to lay out a bunch of specific examples, I'm a follower
not a leader in my guild. But I can definitely attest that my guild has
succeeded and grown precisely because it has been actively grouping together
(both exp and raids) from when it first had about the critical mass that you
described. Now the guild has some 65s and a good number of 60s and is
getting into the really high-end stuff, and consistently attracts and keeps
good people who are fun to play with. That's a lot more important than being
"uber," frankly.


P.S. You could visit www.eversmack.com (our guild site), and post your query
in the "Banter" section as a guest, I'll bet nobody would mind offering you
the benefits of the guild's experiences. Tell them Haabbes the beastlord
steered you there.
