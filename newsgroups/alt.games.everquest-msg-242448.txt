Make the hotkey now.

Ummm I think you need to know what you are really getting here (Valour
and Storms not BoT).  I suggest you go to one of the best wizard
resources:

Always ask before looting.  Ethereal parchments and spectral parchments
become easier to farm as you progress but the cleric's main point is
that he could possibly use the resulting spell which he could get from
the parchment ... you couldn't until you levelled.

You should have stayed with your group ... groups involve team work and
your job is to lay some heavy smack on the mobs when the MT has and
maintains aggro.  If the group wipes before you then go for the zone
hitting your train hotkey as you go.

I feel his/her pain.

No ... you need a strategy for doing it.  It has been a while since I
played my wizard but there are a number of strategies for doing this
trial which work very well.  There are even some which are different.
For example the most novel way I have done this trial with my wiz was
with a PBAOE (Point Blank Area of Effect) group of four wizzies, a
cleric and a chanter.  I must admit that all of us were over 60 at the
time.  Read up on the strategies at various sites.

All of those items will certainly help your mana pool.  Particularly
the horse/drogomor but it sounds like your base mana pool may also be a
bit low at 56.

Waste of mana really ... the spell is very good on reducing aggro and
is excellent on single or double mobs ... not with the waves you
encounter on the trials.
