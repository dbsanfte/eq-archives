Stuff ct

>(not really a rare spawn) but I found an FBSS on a vendor once.


AAHAHHHA that would be insane. I bet you pottied self...
I kinda wonder though, some items translate to huge prices on a vendor
and seeing an FBSS on a vendor for like 3 k would really suck if you
only had like 700 MAKE MONEY FAST!!!!

The best thing I found on a vendor was when I was a very young druid
on trib and people sold mammoth hide leggings for the then ungodly
amount of like 200 plat and I saw a pair on a vendor in Everfrost for
like 14 plat. I seriously got insanely happy. Ah, those were the days.

The kunark stuff has OPPOSITE land pricing, where like a giant lord
tunic's POS is 2 k on a vendor or something and players would have
trouble selling it for 200 plat.

Velious, meanwhile, makes sense. I was trying to get my troll the
giant captains chain tunic thing which is like the rygorr sort of but
large only, then I spot it on a vendor for 300 plat. I was going to
buy it but when I got back with 300 plat gone =/ I finally got the
straight dope on that it comes from those two always spawned frost
giants on the way into Kael in EW and is not super duper rare (you
will get one eventually and hey, even at level 55 they are xp)
