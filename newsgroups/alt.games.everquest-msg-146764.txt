As with all such questions, the answer is "It depends."  What class are you?
Are you looking to solo or looking for groups?

As a cleric that depended on groups for XP, I spent 36-40 in Eastern Wastes,
finding groups at the Ulthork Tree or the Rygorr Fort.  You can also find
some drops there; back when I hunted, you could get 50pp for each Ulthork
Tusk you looted.  And as a cleric, I much appreciated the Dark Ember I got
from the fort.

After 40, I tried the Dreadlands for a bit, then quickly moved into Karnor's
Castle.  Both are places where it's somewhat easy to find groups.  There's
decent loot to be had in KC, depending on where you camp.

If you're looking to solo, then I won't be able to help ya.  =)  You might
try asking at a class-specific message board for those kind of answers.
