I know what you mean. I ended up staying in LoIO till 27. Then I did the
giant fort in WW to 28. Finally, my guild took me to SK for the last level.
But I was told WW or Lake would still have been good for me to get there.

But 30 just plain sucked. SK and Inner Paw helped. But mostly I killed
Griffennes and Mammoths for exp and profit. Very slow. Also didn't help that
I was TPing for profit too. Gotta love group teleports. ;-)

I found I could solo the giant fort in WW, but made killer progress with a
partner there. Rangers and Monks preferable. Mages and Necros were good too.
Plus there is always a chance for a forest loop.

Good Luck
