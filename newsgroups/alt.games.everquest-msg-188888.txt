Excellent resource.  A shame Muse lost interest in the game.

Haven't been here in about 9 months.  I find that alla's/eqatlas has more 
and better information.

Pretty much the most complete database of information I've found.  I'm 
definitely not sorry I got a premium membership to this one (removes all 
the ads on both allakhazam's sites and on eqatlas.com, in addition to 
unlocking many very nice features).

And a few more that you'll probably find useful:

http://eq.crgaming.com/ has some good class info.  Some of it is wrong 
(like the ranger archery cap), but I find that most of the time it's 
pretty accurate.

http://lucy.fnord.net/ is an excellent database of spells.  Tells you 
what each spell does, which classes get it, and for the most part which 
items have that effect on them.

http://www.magelo.com/ to keep track of what's on your character and 
stuff. Also good for getting ideas on what you might want to go after.  
Premium membership is $12/year and worth it IMO.

http://www.everquestlive.com/ the official everquest site.  Mostly useful 
for the scheduled patch message page, and server/network status.

As for SoL and PoP being worth it?  Yes, but I have no idea what your 
financial situation is like.  The bazaar will make your life incredibly 
easier with respect to your gear (which in turn tends to make your 
gametime more enjoyable).  The PoK instaports are incredibly nice for 
getting around, though less nice than the bazaar IMO.  Also makes 
tradeskills (should you find yourself sucked into that) and getting new 
spells much easier.

HTH,

Devon
