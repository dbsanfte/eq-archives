I keep hearing everyone (myself included) ask where they should hunt
at level xx as class oo. That this is such a common question leads me
to believe/hope that SOMEONE out there has all this information jotted
down for visitors to use.

Anyone want to share their favorite EQ Hunting Guide locations?

For myself, I lived for many levels off of the suggestions in the
guide at EQNecro even when I was not playing one.

http://necro.eqclasses.com/hunting.asp

The problem I find with that guide is that it is not regularly
updated, and once you get past level 50 there are about 4 entries
left. I have not checked it recently, but I also never saw any entries
for Velious and darn few ones for Kunark. I need other sources now
that my main is past level 50.

Any help would be much appreciated.
