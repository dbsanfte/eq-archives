The really sad part is that he really is happy to keep the thread
alive, and you're helping him do it.  Obviously someone looking to buy
an account couldn't give a rat's ass about how you or I feel about it,
and so will probably just assume that people flaming the seller are
jerks or whatnot.  Every reply to the thread means it's more likely to
be seen by someone new, especially someone reading this using one of
those web abominations.  
Every time you or anyone else flames him, and he replies back with a
mild and inoffensive request to please continue it in email, he looks
like a reasonable person, and the flamers look like idiot.  Take a
step back, imagine that you have never read this newsgroup, and you're
looking to buy a character for some reason.  You have one person
offering to sell an account, and a dozen people attacking the seller.
The seller calmly asks that you abuse him via email so as not to
clutter the newsgroup.  If you are familiar with usenet, this appears
to be reasonable behavior.  Unless you have a strong opinion against
selling of account, you assume the newsgroup is full of flaming
assholes.
Let it die.  We know you don't like account selling (and for the
record I hate it, but I have no problem with guild accounts, so I
guess I'm a hypocrite), but you're not doing a damn bit of good.  When
you wrestle with a pig you only get muddy and the pig enjoys it.
