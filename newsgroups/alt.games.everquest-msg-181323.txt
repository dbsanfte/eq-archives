    I forgot reading about this "bug" the other day and went with a friend
to get PLd.  He decided the bandits would be good to kill . . . well, at lvl
14 it conned dark blue to me, but I couldn't hurt the thing for nothing!
He's something like a lvl 54 shaman so he tried killing it so we could move
on.  He barely got it down 1 bub of health and ran out of mana.  Not
entirely sure if he was exaggerating, but he was saying it had like 150k HP.
A lvl 38 wiz came to help and we got it down maybe 1 more bub.  Another
bandit ran up so I tried killing that one . . . same thing!  So I think
there's 2 bugged bandits there.  But anyway, as for the low lvl chanter
charming it . . . I am a chanter and didn't try that honestly - I was a
little in shock with what was happening to think of that - but I have doubts
that it would work because the thing resisted every spell I tried to cast on
it!  Even casting the resist debuffer on it didn't help.  So...the wiz
ported us all out of there and the thing wasn't even down to half life.
Maybe I'll go back one day soon with a high lvl druid...the shaman...and a
lvl 61 cleric to try out the charm....I'll keep you posted on the results!
