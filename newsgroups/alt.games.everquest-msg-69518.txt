That's what I used to think.  But, when I was in Guk getting Evil Eye bags 
for the party, a frog with a pet attacked us, and we killed the frog ( pet 
was mezzed ).  After the frog died, we mem blurred it to death, but it 
wouldn't despawn.  Maybe our prozimity to it was reaggroing it to negate 
the blur, though...
