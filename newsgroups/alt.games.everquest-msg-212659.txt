Just a note, FV is the "Role Playing" server.

Get in an experience group in a place like Paludal Caverns<best choice for
now>, Aviak village or spires in SK, or High Hold. High Hold assumes you did
some faction work there at lower levels. In a group you can split tanking
with other players so your AC will just be annoying instead of deadly. Stay
in the group until you get another 5-6 levels.

Reason I say this is at 20 you are right on the line between poverty while
leveling and being able to make some pp as you level. Around ~25 you can
kill mobs drop things like fine steel weapons.

As an alternative, group with one person that can fear stuff. An enchanter,
necro, or SK type with their "fear anything" is a better choice then a
ranger/druid fear animals or cleric/paladin fear undead. Fear kiting reduces
the damage you take by roughly 80%. The only time you take damage is when
the mob resists or the spell breaks.

Just my op: You won't be happy with the stuff you would buy at level 20. If
you are making good pp at 25 you are more likely to buy a single piece per
level that will last you into 40ish.
