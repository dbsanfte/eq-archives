We were in ToV, the banners, the walls the firepots were all deadly
root traps. I types rewind six or eight times, it is hard when you are
getting beat on. Our MA and SA got stuck on the same banner, and had
to watch us fight.

 The Dragons escaped us into the walls, one even died on top of a wall
where we could not loot it.

Collision detect may not be fixed, but all the flies in Norrath should
be extinct soon, since every other surface is made from flypaper.
