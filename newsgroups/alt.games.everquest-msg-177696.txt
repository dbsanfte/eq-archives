church in my entire life yet still have understanding of the major =
concepts of Christianity due to being trained for 8 years in the Bible, =
knowledge that most people who go to church do not even likely possess.=20

  And that qualifies you to post off-topic?

  3) I was relatively untouchable before I was chosen, but when I became =
one of the 2 prophets I became invulnerable to spiritual and probably =
physical harm, soon I may become invulnerable to legal harm if the =
double jeopardy law still applies which I doubt it does, but if it does =
and I am acquitted of my terrorist crimes which all crimes are =

the antichrist's fascist world regime is in power which will be for 7 =
years beginning the start of the year 2003 which is 3 years after the =
year 2000 which is really the year 1997 AD. I will only be here for 3.5 =

due to double=20

already tried for.  What=20
crimes have you been tried for?

  4) I can swill King Cobra malt liquor, gamble(and win!) and curse with =
drug dealers while also being able to drink Heineken, play chess(and =
win!), and speak in an erudite language with millionaire engineers.

  None of which (even if true and it's not) qualifies you to be a =
"prophet".

  5) It was what I was born to do as God has never asked me to do =
anything else before, and actually didn't even seem to notice I even =
existed until now.=20
  God didn't notice you existed?  Might that be because he doesn't =
exist?
