>> I remember a kid, about ten years old, with his beer-swilling mom and
shirtless dad, sitting in the living room with a bunch of their equally
brainless, shirtless (why don't these guys ever wear shirts?),
swastika-and-eagle tatooed friends/relatives, proudly answering his father,
who was shouting "go ahead! tell 'em what you want to do!" screaming "I'M
GONNA KILL FUCKIN' NIGGERS!" over and over. <<<


I remember a Phil Donahue show (amazing I remember Phil Donahue :p) where he
had the KKK as guests. A six year old girl, her proud mother sitting behind
her, kept repeating "I hate niggers."

Then Donahue asked her to point to a nigger in the audience.

Donahue was filmed in New York, so the majority of the audience was black.
But the girl couldn't do it. She didn't know what a nigger was, she only
knew she hated them.

Donahue's comment to the mother said it all: "You must be so proud."
