I hear that..

 I saw a mumber of how meny players they are suppose to have that play EQ
now, and when I did a little math, it was an increese of over 1 million a
month they they will be bringing in due to this incresse. Now I am sure my
math was bad, the the number of active accouts they also have I got wrong,
but even anywhere close to that + / - a few hundred K, it would seem to me
that someone is getting a pay raise.

 Again for a while I will pay because I love the game Not because I want to.
However I hope that they will get more CS reps. to help, and more GM's each
server. I know no mater who gripes about this, or who this bothers it won't
change thier minds, the cost IS going up. I wish we had 3 month notice
before the change. I beleive that is a more fair warning. I will also drop
service a month here and there. to help off set the cost, and in my own
personal protest. I used to just keep my account running. I know this won't
get the message through either, but its my own personal way of letting them
know they should leave things as is...
