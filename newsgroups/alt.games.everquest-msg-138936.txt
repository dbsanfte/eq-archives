Well, Iksar regen.  Point Lizard
Iksar see in the dark.  Point Lizard.
Iksar have an attack humans don't, tail based.  Point Lizard.

Humans have.... hmm....well I'm sure you can think of something.

I know, humans can get IR/UV items.  Don't help much when
they are dead.  I know, humans can get regen items.  Don't stack
with human natural regen, though, because THERE AINT NONE.
I know humans can buy AA regen... having to waste all that effort
to be as good as the lizards were in the first place.

I also know humans level up faster.  But I'm comparing one
monk at a given level to another at that level... not worrying
about how hard it was to get there.

I also know that Humans have been in the game longer, and
level faster.  There are more 60 human monks than 60 Iksar
monks?  What a surprise. Doesn't mean they are better.

On the other hand, there may well be equalizing factors
I'm not aware of, and at any rate I'm happy to concede that
both flavors of monk can do the monk jobs far better than
any other class out there.  If there were halfling monks I'd
play one of those and Min/maxing be damned!
