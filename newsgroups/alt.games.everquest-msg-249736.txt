I encountered a married pair in blackburrow; a human and a half elf. The
half elf was very ill, and they were lost and desperate to reach the healing
waters of the cleric's pool of qeynos. I guided them there, and in gratitude
they gave me gifts that I did not need, but to refuse them would be an
insult. I wish I could have passed them on to someone who would genuinely
need them but there are few like that now.

I never knew if they were guides or dedicated roleplayers but I was touched
either way. I know that a lot of people feel that Sony can't do anything
right with everquest, but if that event was their idea, then I think they
did well; and if it was the act of players, then I'm glad, because this is
why I started the game in the first place.

Has anyone else met this couple on Rodcet Nife or any other server?
