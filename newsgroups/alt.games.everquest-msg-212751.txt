	I do not need "faith" in logic and my senses, because if I refuse to
accept them, I will be killed in very short order.  It doesn't matter if
they're true; it doesn't matter if this is all some kind of illusion or
simulation we're trapped in.  Logic and sense data are the rules you have to
play by as long as you intend to stay here.
