I know you're a ranger, and rangers like outdoor zones for a number of good reasons, but
you might want to explore some of the indoor zones.  The reason is that the playing style
is quite a lot different, and you'll be compelled to rethink your strategies, which can
be a lot of fun.  Plus, often there's an xp bonus in indoor zones, and better loot drops
there.
