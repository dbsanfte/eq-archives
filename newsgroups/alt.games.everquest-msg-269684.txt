Dire charm can (could?) also wear off  after an extended period, but 
it's like 14 hours or something.

Apparently there is (was?) no 'unlimited' in EQ, only 'Longer than 
anyone should be using one effect'.

I had my mage pet poof once when I had been farming greens for stuff, 
went over in a corner of the zone and went to bed, came back and started 
farming. (I don't remember why I didn't log out... I had a good reason 
though.) When I posted on a message board the community guy actually 
checked and told us that there is (was?) a time limit, it's just very 
very long, like 14 hours, on permenant effects.
