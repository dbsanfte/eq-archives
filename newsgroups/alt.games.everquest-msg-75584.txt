I've hunted bears in WCommons to exhaustion, so I thought I'd try DC
tonight. I was there a few times with an ex and he made it look trivial, but
I recall thinking that I'd not like to be there solo... but solo it is,
tonight... any tips for hunting there, besides bringing levitate along?
Darklet is nearly 18 (yeah, still) and has all the typical spells, good
equipment, etc. I might add that I tend to stay in places that I know well.
I hate surprises -- which is why I feel a bit of trepidation at soloing the
Cauldron. So that said -- I'd appreciate any tips for hunting this zone.
Can't recall what my ex did, that was 2 years ago, but whatever it was, he
did it well!

thanks,
Darklet
