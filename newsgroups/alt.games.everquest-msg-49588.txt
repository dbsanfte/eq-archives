After five or six days starting to see how the server is shaping up.

1. Its population is descending at about the same rate as all the
other new servers in the past, maybe slightly faster. Nothing unusual
there.

2. Is there more roleplaying? I would say yes. People in groups stay
in character more. Gfay and to a lesser extent Freeport are hellholes
but outside of that, its a lot better.

HOWEVER the major problem continues to be language barriers. Until a
few more people start getting multilingual there is very little
communication between races.

3. The powergamer crowd seems to be less represented than usual,
especially in the melee classes. With everyone anon theres no way to
know for sure the level curve, and its hard to communicate with people
of other races anyways, so I can't make any firm call on the level
curve, but my gut is telling me there is somewhat less emphasis on
powergaming in general (though of course they exist, I *still* get
rude people who open conversations with "what level are you?").

At this moment the highest I know of is 22, but I only know of six
over 18 (five casters) and the beginning of the pack is at about 14
and lower. Oddly enough the melees, who generally level faster at the
lowest levels, are not as well represented at the top of the curve as
they were on other new servers. I don't know what to make of that (or
even if its valid) but I get the feeling a multilingual warrior will
have NO trouble getting groups on this server.

That doesn't include iksars; no one but the iksars know what their
levels are like, they do level rather faster at first than the
mainlanders, so there could be a few higher levels out there too.

4. Theres virtually no economy whatsoever yet. Some patchwork being
sold, but business is slow when you're mostly restricted to people who
can understand you.

5. Permagroups are much in evidence. These are people who had their
group set before the server ever went live, and generally stick to
that group. You see these on every server but I see more of them here.
