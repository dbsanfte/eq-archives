harmtouch doesn't get you out of a jam..

Not true.   1) Nothing can see through sneak when not facing the front of
the mob.  No mob in the game, period.
A lot of see invis mobs (like PoH shit on the way to the ss) doesn't see
hide/sneak either
And at 51, sneak speed for rogues starts to raise, until its normal speed.
