Have *you* tried the trials other than Executioner yet?  (Before you ask,
I've fought the Tribunal).  Executioner is the one with the best known
strategy, but it is far from easiest.

I'd rank it third, maybe fourth.  Out of six.

Most people are just hesitant to try new things.  They already know how to
win Executioner, and know they can.  Why would they want to try something
else?
