You really are dense aren't you?  You did not pay for a copy of the
game, you merely licensed a copy of the client software.  Do you even
understand the difference?

You own nothing when it comes to EQ.  You have licensed a copy of the
client software, of which you may make a copy or distribute it to
other machines you use in order to connect to Sony's servers.
Anything else is a violation.

To think you own any portion of the game itself is pure stupidity.
