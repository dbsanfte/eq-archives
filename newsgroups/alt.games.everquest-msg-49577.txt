Thats an illusion, by and large.  As a warrior (and as a cleric) it sure
looks like there is no exp in a raid... but that's because we aren't
in the KS group.  You don't do enough damage, and likely have
me along not doing any damage at all, just keeping you alive.

The group with the heavy nukes, on the other hand, is getting roughly
twice as much exp per hour as they would in a single group situation.
I've -been- in the KS group a few times, believe me, it can be
incredible.

Yes, a raid probably generates less exp per hour overall than splitting
up into independant exp groups... but in many cases the exp is
still not negligible at all.

Splitting the exp up equitably would also give you reason not to
pad the raids so much; split that exp fewer ways and it counts for
more.

On the other hand, if the Vision(tm) is that we do everything
possible in just groups, then this wouldn't help; you'd see more
people doing constant raiding, instead of spending some
of their EQ time in obligatory EXP grinds.
