You're just describing a standard, multi-pull group.  In
most outside full groups, there's little reason to not have
someone start the second pull before the first mob dies.
If anything, the group would have been better off with a
monk (or ranger) to do the pulling since they could also
contribute damage.  Or a shaman (DoTs on the engaged mob
and low/no downtime due to Cannabalize.)  Or a druid for
damage shields.

That's only true if the melees have less than 100 points
of stamina when having an empty stamina bar has no effect on
melee ability.  The only effect stamina drain would have
then would be an inability to jump.

Yeah, he'd be the one that was trying to power-level his
chanter twink, right?  (The SoWing character being a high-level
druid main, as a guess?)
