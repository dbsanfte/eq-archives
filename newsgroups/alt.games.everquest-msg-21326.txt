They tell you up front that further conditions apply before you can
USE the software. Says so right there on the box. If you don't like
it, don't buy. (I'm not entirely sure, I'll have to check later, but I
think the EULA can even be viewed on the official site now, too. No
need to buy before reading the EULA anymore.) I'm sure most companies
would gladly send you a copy of the eula if you email them wanting to
see before you buy, too.
