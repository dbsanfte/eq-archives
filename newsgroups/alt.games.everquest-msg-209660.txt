The original thought of some was to have a trade ogre to be seen quickly.
It makes some sense in that gnomes can sometimes be tricky to select (like
when crawling around under the robes of a High Elf).  I do think that all
traders should just be a standard char type (when you do a /trade you see
the message "You fell different").

For me, the annoying thing about the bazaar is the seeming need to be right
next to the bank.  With no encumbrance in the bazaar, there should be no
issues with large amounts of cash/loot.
