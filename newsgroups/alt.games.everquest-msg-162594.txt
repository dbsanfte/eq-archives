/Rant ON    =) I've been in the mood today.

Why is it that all other pet owners can cast Invisibility versus Undead, and
not have the Live pet pop, but when we cast Gather Shadows ( regular
Invisibility ) our pets pop.  Shouldn't they be able to see through regular
Invisibility?  They are just a pile of bones...  no real life..
 ie -=UNDEAD=-

Wouldn't it make sense that our pets should only pop if we Go VS  Undead.

Now the reason for the rant..  A friend that just left EQ left me some of
his better stuff (for safe keeping incase he desides to come back)  And on
of the things he gave me was the  Necro/SK Holly grail.. A pre nerf CoS.  I
want my cake and to eat it two..  why can't SOE/V do the logical thing adnd
let necros/SKs go invis with there pets in tow.  NO one that couldn't see
invis would be any wiser all they would see is a lost pet trying to find its
owner.

/rant off

I know I answered my own question...  I put SOE/v and logic in the same
line.  I know better.
