I had one of these card (3d Prohpet 4000XT 64Meg  PCI card),
  BUT could I get it to work with EQ, nope I could not.

I have windows XP and I had downloded all the latest drivers for the card ,
for the MB , but
all I got when playing was triangulated tiles in the 3d sections ;(

So aater 2 weeks of messing about with it , Ive sent it back  ;(

and stay with my 32M card instead
