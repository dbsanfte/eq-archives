Thanks for taking the time to respond.  I think I was most surprised as I
have heard nightmare things about the EQ community from other game
communites (always heresay).  I'm coming over from AC and I will tell you
flat out this newsgroup (at least what I have seen of it in the past few
days) blows away the AC newsgroup and the AC boards on the Vault Network.  I
know that sounds like a kissup statement but go see for yourself sometime.
So once again, thanks everyone!!
