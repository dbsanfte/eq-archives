Sorry, I have to disagree with you here as to clerics being useless. Being a
cleric myself, we can simply keep the group healed better and faster in most
cases. I know there has been times where we've fought 6 and 7 mobs in an
LDoN group, no crowd control, and I've kept them healed as a cleric. Have a
druid try that and see how long you havea  group.
