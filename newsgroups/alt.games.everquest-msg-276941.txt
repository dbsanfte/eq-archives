I believe that the theory is that homeowners are often armed, and people 
that break into homes can be presumed to know this, and so when someone 
breaks into an occupied home, we can presume they are armed and planning 
to incapacitate or kill the homeowner.  Thus, the homeowner can respond 
as if it were a self-defense situation, rather than a mere defense of 
property situation.
