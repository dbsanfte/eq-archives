We went through this a long while back.

We got dorf and dragon faction and killed in arena and HoT and did he SS
armour quests. But it soon became apparent to us that to proceed as a guild
we had to knock the scaly bastards on the head and ripped through 1st broods
for Sleepers and NToV. The rate the guild gained loot and power increased
exponentially. We then carried on in this vain and never looked back at
faction again except the times when we got Tormax boots to quest with yeli
or yelis head to quest with tormax. Ping pong faction for some.

Move to Luclin and worked our way through it. Took us as a guild around 6
months to be totally VT ready. Admittedly we did it half heartedly for first
three months and then we went all out on it.

Once in Vex Thal you'll be surprised at the loot pinatas. We clear zone in
4 - 5 hours and nett around 30 loots. All this loot increases out power
against planar encounters and we are about to get to Tower of Sol Ro and
progress from there. Prolly leave VT behind soon.

Progression is the key at the high end of the game. See new areas, new
encounters, new mobs even new loots.
