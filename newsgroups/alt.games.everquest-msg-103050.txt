Wrong...

She raised him, and "should" know him better than anyone else.
Whatever problems he had were a combination of his mental problems and
all of his life expiriences up until the day he decided to end it all.

She knew he had problems. If she did all that she could for him, then
there is no one to blame for his actions. If she did not, then she
will have to live with that for the rest of her life.

When you become a parent, your responsibilities do not end when the
child reaches adulthood.
