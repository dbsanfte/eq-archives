you get enough opinions of people and it switches from opinion to accepted
fact until proven otherwise.  I feel enough poeple have shown that and you
have pretty much ignored the fact.  Your opinion in this matter is pretty
much irrelevant, considering that your not going to change the ongoing
practice of calling things by nicknames.
There was a whole article about naming conventions and 4 reasons its done,
and you ignored that.  Dry reading, but the point should of been obvious.
Someone pointed out that dancing in like the 60's was renamed, and you
ignored that.
Some people believe some really wierd stuff.  There were about 50 people who
cut off their genitals and commited suicide because they wanted to jump on
the comet before 2000 and the end of the world.  Hey, but that was their
opinion, and its no more valid than yours or mine.
