Bah, don't let FACTS get in their way Jekke!!!

"Waah Waah! But now it takes a little longer to get everyone these
weapons melees cannot possibly live without! Call me a
Waaaaaaaaaaaambulance!"

Sleeper awake means you go into ST, wax MotG and Prog, then send someone
invis down to the bottom to see if the other golem is wielding. Usually
get 1 usable primal per clearing, and we're only going there to equip
1handers really. 1-2 hour raid for 18 people now that nothing sees
invis, and 3 mobs potentially dropping primals. 3 day repop too I
believe?

Hmmm... sounds to me like it may actually be EASIER for smaller up-and-
coming guilds to 'farm' primal, but more difficult for 'powerguilds' to
equip themselves as quickly. Plus with AA skills, the zone and key-
holding-dragons are 10x easier anyway, opening it up to even more
smaller guilds with under 100 members.
