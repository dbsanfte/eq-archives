It's definitely a nice looking game. One question though... all the
screenshots are from a "top down" perspective. Is there are first person
option that you know of ?

Speaking for myself only (I'm sure :)) I require a first person view for
full immersion. I occcasionally use the  "exterior" views in EQ to get a
better perspective on something (especially when feigning), but I can't
fathom having to play the entire game that way. It'd suck the sense of
reality right out of it for me.

Theres nothing quite like having a Goblin walk up behind you and give you a
little love tap to get the blood flowing while medding :) You just don't get
the adrenaline flowing when you see everything before it has a chance to
sneak up on you.

I know I'm probably the only one that feels this way, but I NEED my first
person perspective to enjoy this particular type of game.
