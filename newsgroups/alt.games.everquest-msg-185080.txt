I lived in that zone forever... there's been some changes.

1) Elrod is a quest mob - if you hail her, she's expecting some delivery
from the Indigo Brotherhood
2) Dark Huntress now has a proper model (undead) - drops no loot still
3) Sir B..... I forget his name, SK, slightly easier to kill than Dark
Huntress seems to have an aweful habit of wandering around all over the
place and respawns on a normal timer. Drops nothing or his remains, not sure
what they're for.
