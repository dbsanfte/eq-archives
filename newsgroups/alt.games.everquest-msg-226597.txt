You say that, but hey, as a bard Ive been SLOWER with my non uber 52%
slow.

While a perfect group would probably have a cleric for heals and
rezzes, Im happy for my friendly pally to rez me with his 90% rez, to
buff me with his pally buffs, because they are better than the crap I
get, eg I have to sing without missed notes and if Im not doing mana,
and call of the muse, and resists people will moan, so, that leaves me
1 I can pick of my own, and generally it will be.. HASTE coz otherwise
the tanks moan.

so, at what point do I get to sing much that boosts anything else? I
dont.. 

The problem is SKs and Pallys have come to think of themselves as the
greatest, you shouldnt, you should be as good as the next guy in what
you do, you have fighting and spell casting abilites, so your fighting
should be less good than the wars, because what you dont have in
fighting power you get in spell power.

Whatever happens in EQ people will always moan. Everyone wants to be
indispensable.. Well news to you all, theres what 15 classes, you cant
have all of them in a group. You cant all be indispensable, each class
has its highs and its lows, work with them, not against them.
