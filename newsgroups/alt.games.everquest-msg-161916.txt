I have found playing a shaman both fun and rewarding. I made a iskar at 
1st but i didn't care for the area, also i didn't like the idea of not 
being able to go into most cities. So i redid my shaman as a barb and 
found being night blind to be an utter pain! For this reason i skip most 
night blind races when considering a new toon. (i know i'm closed 
minded) so them i picked up sol and tried a vah shir shaman. A very rare 
class/race combo on my server. Most vah shir i find are eather bard, or 
warriors. Also another problem you will have is the level pentey all 
shaman races outside of val shir (or so i'm told) has some degree of it. 
  If you have room make both and toy around with them. You might find a 
druid to be more your style. I would personaly pick a good server and 
make about 4 different toons of different races and classes and play 
them on and off switching every so often till you find a class or race 
you like. Then look at the other options, such as you like being a gnome 
you can make a pally, a cleric, any of the robe casters, a warrior, and 
so on. It's compleatly up to you!
