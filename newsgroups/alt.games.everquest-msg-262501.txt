That will happen no matter what, and every country has them.  As an
aside, most of the Middle East's beef with the US is specifically on
that topic, US financed troops.  Israel to be exact.  The Arabs have
hated us ever since we carved up Palestine to make Isreal after WWII.
The Israeli's would have lost long before now if not for US backing.
That's a real problem for us.

No doubt on that, the rest of the world has been dealing with longer
than us.  Realistically this is our first forray into international
terrorism as a nation.  Sure government organizations have been
involved (CIA, military, etc.) but the nation as a whole.  Most of
Europe has dealt with for decades if not longer.

I have to regrettably agree with no simple solutions either, and
that's a shame.  I posted my view on that elswhere in this thread so I
won't extole again.
