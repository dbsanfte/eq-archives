With another kid coming you can afford to spend $100 on something silly?

Who says level 35 is much better than 25?  I strongly disagree.

Here's a tip instead...if all you care about are levels, just buy an account
from someone.  I'm sure you can find a level 50+ for $50 and then (by your
definition) life will be WONDERFUL and you will have saved some REAL money
that would be better spent on your family instead of a game anyway.
