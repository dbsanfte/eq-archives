nope, there is no endless button.  No way to link to another hotkey either.
Someone said earlier about using a weight on the keyboard, though :).  I've
done that to build up swimming.  Autorun on, weight on the left arrow key,
and you move around in circles gaining skills.  If you do it in a corner you
tend to climb the corner more often then not so you actually stay out of the
water a lot.. it can be done in a corner, though, without a weight.  Anyone
know if you can hold down a hotkey and have it automatically hit itself when
it pops back up?  That would be nice, and a way to do what you are asking
about.
