No. I run a gf4 4200 with absolutely no problems(1) under the new dx9
engine. Even my old voodoo5 has very few visual artifacts with the game.
The features that the newer Radeons have that somewhat older Nvidia
cards don't aren't currently being used in EQ's engine. The main
difference is the support for pixel shader 2.0, which definately isn't
being used yet in EQ. I didn't see your previous post so I don't know
specifically what you were having problems with but I do know it's
possible to run a gf4200 with no problems in the current engine(1).


(1) Other than the problems absolutely everyone regardless of what card
they use are having.
