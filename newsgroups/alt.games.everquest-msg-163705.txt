I agree, I really liked the SoV plan, where you had to make it to each
ring before you could be ported there; you even had to do a quest in SS in
order to get a key from there to CS!

Now, you can get a port to CS at level one if you like.

On the other hand, I dislike the long involved key quests needed to get
into some zones, which tend to heavily favor some classes over others.
