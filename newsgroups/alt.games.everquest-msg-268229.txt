Aye, the fishing is the final 1/8 of the tradeskill spawn.   I listed that
below as a separate case (which seems to have gotten snipped in your response)

And Cluster of fish.

Quest items no longer use gathering, as of the last major patch.

The evidence is mixed, but this appears to be incorrect.   If you do not touch
the fish you can eventually work into a position where the majority of the
tradeskill nodes in any specific zone are tied up in maintaining the fish
(over)population.  Clearing out the pond gives each of those fish nodes the
chance to respawn as a different resouce.
