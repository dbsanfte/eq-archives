Have you played a necro?
In a mistmoore ldon group last night I was slowing the undead mobs, mezzing
any undead adds, coordinating with the chanter to mez non-undead adds and
slow non-undead. Casting a lifetap over time spell on the mob. Positioning
myself
behind the mob and sending in the pet (so it can backstab). If it is a
caster
casting mind wrack on it.  Figuring out who most needs my extra health so I
can
cast shadowbond on them. If the group as a whole needs health casting the
group lifetap instead. Figuring out how much mana i've got to spare for
undead nukes or ordinary nukes for non-undead. And every 9 minutes figuring
out
how best to use my wake the dead ability for extra dps. Figuring out of we'd
do
more damage if I used my AC debuff. Lifetapping if I got hit and need more
health.

And that's just for ordinary pulls when everything goes right... I barely
have time
to press all the buttons and refresh pet buffs and lich let alone do any
chatting...
