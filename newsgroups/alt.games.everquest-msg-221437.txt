That just doesn't sound right. It's pretty rare that, even with a
non-uber warrior, I'll take more than one or two hits after a slow.
And realistically, we're fighting mobs where I can't take a few hits
(as a shaman) after an initial slow, we're fighting mobs where I'd
probably want a warrior as main tank anyway. 

  ... and no, I never wait to slow unless it's a something truely
nasty. You can actually work taunt to your advantage in that
situation. Shaman gets big agro intially, warrior hits taunt and if it
works he's suddenly way up on the hate list and doesn't have to worry
about agro for the rest of the fight. Where it does break down is if
I'm casting DoTs since the poison DoTs cause pretty big agro every
tick. Warriors have a very tough time holding agro in that situation
unless they're pretty uber.
