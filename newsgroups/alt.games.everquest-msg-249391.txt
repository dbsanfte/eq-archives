I dint say it was unfair... I said 
" LDON is all wrong with the gather points in some specific camp and
can  use only there.  waste of my time. "
I said I wanted to hunt where I wanted and to spend my points where I
wanted...

Nope, I am asking to be able to access content that is un attainable
to me unless I become the gimp asses who insist on playing in only one
camp.  I want to see the world... not be restricted to one camp and
force others to play my way so I can get what I want.  

Is that the way it is... nope,  do I actually expect them to change it
... nope, I was just stating my opinion.

I don't agree with the system they have implemented.  I do continue to
play in the expansion, because I like to Play... and have fun.
Forcing me to force others to go to a specific camp is not fun.

example... the other night we were starting an adventure... needed a
tank... the "Tank" insisted he would not come unless it was a HARD
adventure.   

Personally I thought... fuck him...   but no, leader said yes, we did
a hard, and failed miserably.  then went to do a normal... and
completed in quick time.  Credit to the "tank" it was him that made
the call to cancel first adv, and start a new one fresh... and he
stayed with us.  in the end he was a good person...

my point is, don't make me have to be that way with people to get what
I want.  That is not who I am, nor what I want to be.  

so... um... there
