That's covered by (d), crowd control. Pre-emptive crowd control, perhaps,
but
it's still crowd control.

Aside from which, when you rely on pacify pulling, resists can make life...
rather interesting. All of the resists I've had on pacify have been in LDoN.
When the resist is on the MOB standing next to the "assassination" target,
and it's the cleric doing the pacifying, it can make life difficult.

(In that group we had a chanter and shaman - the chanter mezzed the add and
the shaman healed in my rather abrupt absence. They scraped through. As for
why the chanter wasn't doing the pacifying, some chanters seem to have an
irrational dislike of pacification pulling.)

The main drawback to pacify pulling is that it takes time, and time is at a
premium in LDoN. Ergo defensive CC (chanter, bard, necro) is usually
preferable. When I've been handed that job I've usually try to pacify
slightly in advance to eliminate that penalty.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
