Failing? No, that's present tense. "Failed" is much more accurate.

I agree, but it's important in rather a subtle way, which may be lost
on movie-goers. There's a level of horror in how the ring twisted
Smeagol, once you consider that it was also starting to twist Bilbo,
and Frodo after him, the same way.

But like I say, that's subtle, and requires thinking. Books give you
time for that kind of thinking, but a movie, even a three hour movie,
doesn't.
