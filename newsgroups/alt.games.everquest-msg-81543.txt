level is extremely important, but cha is also extremely important, and even
more so for charming.  beyond mezzing, ae stunning, and probably even
debuffing, cha is the single most important stat for any enchanter.  If you
neglect it as an enchanter, you probably will have to expend much more mana
and get beat about the head and shoulders longer, making it tougher on your
friendly healer(s).  In places where you cannot mezz, charming on the first
try is critical, and if it doesn't take or is resisted too soon will
ultimately spell disaster.  I'm not sure how seriously important cha is for
druids, I'd suggest getting some minor cha gear if you use charm alot, but
for enchanters, whether you use charm, you need CHA.
