If a wizard uses AE, their damage ouptut exceeds any other class by a
huge margin.

Damage output from AE spells is valuable.

How is it not?

That's the problem. Stick a wizard in a group that insists on pulling
one mob at a time, and yes the wizard looks like a waste. Pull 10
mobs, and now the wizard is an exp making machine that is vital to the
group.

Not often enough.

You have to learn how to use them and manage agro.

Again, the "boredom" factor of a class has no bearing on their
usefulness to a group.

If you don't see the value in spells that can potentially do 10 times
or more HP damage for each point of mana spent, then you are one
clueless fuck.

I'm not surprised. Better get back to your care-bear server. You're
too stupid to understand how to AE, no doubt you're too stupid to
survive on a PvP server as well.
