*Verant* should care. I, as a player, don't give a rat's ass about a
total stranger saying he's leaving, or even many total strangers.

As for "we", we can't tell a thing of value from posts by disgruntled
players. Without the pre- and post-SoL numbers, any speculation based
on Usenet posts is utterly meaningless. We don't have those numbers -
Verant does. I leave it to them to worry about it.
