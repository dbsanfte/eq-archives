    Heh, lovely. I guess now that you should choose your side before even
starting Velious, as "switching sides" once you can do the quests is now all
but impossible (or, rather, too tedious for the reward). Sigh. Imagine how
silly this would have been if full spoilers of all the quests weren't
available. Oh, you picked Dragons and you're a tank? Aheh, oops. Given the
caster/tank split between dragon/giant armour, I can see a few people
getting really upset about this.

    This seems to mesh well with Kendrick's recent bleats of protest over
rogues with Ragebringer going back and getting their Masks. Verant is really
pushing to have "irrevocable decisions" in the game, it seems. Which is too
bad - such events make even the most inquisitive players wait for spoilers
from someone else getting screwed over. How many people are doing their
tenth ring today, I wonder, and how many are waiting?

    (It's odd how the "cool RP" aspects of the RB quest are just now
beginning to show as poor design features. Rogues are PPing the notes needed
and selling them in EC [they must be droppable to be PPable], and rogues
with RB are displacing rogues without at the many tedious camps in the quest
so they can complete their Mask. Not to mention what killing Stanos does to
High Pass when it happens - much like what'll happen to Thurgadain when
someone does his tenth ring quest today.)

    I was unaware an emote had to be displayed in the first place. It was
nice to have one less piece of spam to deal with. Grouping with drinkers
with a low-level alt is annoying.

>- Fixed a problem that often made it difficult to loot really large NPCs.

    Now Kendrick doesn't have to be embarassed by that stupidly large
Progenitator (sp?).

    I wonder if this haste stacks with other item hastes or not. An FBSS
speeds up bows, does it not? (Honestly don't know, am curious.)

    Sigh. Especially with the new confirmation box, why have this? Is there
a mana/time savings with Translocates vs. Gate/Ports?

    And I died to getting stunned too much with DA up last night, too. :-/

    Nice. At least the friends list is bigger. I'm STILL waiting for some
form of  "Is account BLAH on, and on what character?" query. It would reduce
the number of friends one needs to remember greatly, since most of my
friends list is filled with alts of a few players.

    YAY! WOO-HOO! THIS is nice.

    Wonder how many older quests required this. Aegis of Life, most likely.
Can anyone think of others?
