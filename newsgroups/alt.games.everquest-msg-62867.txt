Its not, but it saved the fact that your friend no longer has it, for
that exact reason ;)

Basically what the server does is coordinate saves so that no one item
is ever saved as being on 2 people so that the item is not duped if
the server goes down. In other words, if the item is going to save on
you its set up so it can't be saved on your friend.

You may not always see:

"character saved" 

though the server has kept track of who no longer has what. Believe
me, they have stuff in place to prevent this since the nature of the
beast is that people can go link dead etc at certain times before or
after saving. 

I think once in a million years the accident may be exactly right that
you do end up with two items usually if it involves a corpse, as
someone else said they have id information and can tell when something
is a dupe though.
