Bit sad really, the guy (must be the same one) has an excellent web
page. Definite waste of talent.

Considering he spammed it far and wide (well, at least to alt.angst and
alt.folklore.urban which I saw and each of those included other groups
in the Newsgroups line) I doubt he'll be seen anywhere for long.  Using
the xs4all remailer doesn't really help if you post the url to a
web site which makes it clear who you are.

Nuala, who thinks that the sad thing is he used frames much better
than many sites done by supposedly 'sane' people.
