Do you suffer from ADHD?  You seem to find it incredibly
hard to keep to the point, remember what you've said, and
put together coherent posts.

Necro rezzes are rare at your level because of the expense,
the average level of people you group with, and the fact that
its probably more efficient exp/hour for a necro to solo at
your level than it is to group.

This was in response to your (counter?) claim that necros
need clerics.  In fact, no class NEEDS clerics.  Clerics do
make some things easier, but they certainly are not needed
they way they once used to be.

All 'those sony guys' did was take over the game and try to
keep it profitable.

Soloing, kiting in particular, has certainly been nerfed and
unnerfed by the devs at different times, but soloing has always
been as viable as grouping for some classes.  My only
complaint with the necro was that it was usually far more
efficient to solo for exp than it was to group, at least for
traditionally composed groups, and I prefer to group.  It
would've been nice to have some much faster acting dots
at lower levels for preposterous mana costs to aid in group
dps.

Of late, the trend towards enabling solo play has been
extended far beyond where it used to be.  Take a look
at your DoN spells, for example, cleric.  ;)
