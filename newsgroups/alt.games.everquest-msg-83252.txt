Thank you for playing RealLife(tm)

Your score is 8 out of a possible 46989867

Welcome to Everquest... you are back in our world now
You'll never leave

welcome back, have fun until the next bout of RealLife(tm) tempts you away.

Unfortunately for us RealLife(tm) has not been patched by its programmers
for quite a few million years and their customer support is non existent.
RelaLife(tm) is hard to play unless you are very well twinked to begin with.
