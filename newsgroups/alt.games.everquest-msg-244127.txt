   Well, the reason I said "maybe" here is because I honestly don't know. 
I know there are two time guilds, and that is about it.  I really don't
know which one is the top dog.  And I certainly don't want to spark a Reso
vrs. FnF debate.  Everyone in both guilds is much further along than I will
ever be.  I can't comment on them any more than a chimpanzee can give a
reasoned lectured on the pros and cons of the flat tax idea.

    According to him he's rerolled 2 high leveled characters, but he won't
name them.  Guess the third time might be the charm!
