NWN is a great game with a few bugs.  Always save your character ever so
often since the game can run well for hours and then you crash when zoning.
I have only noticed this if a dedicated server is being used and it happens
to save the game at the same time you are zoning.

NONE of my friends play EQ.  Several of them have NWN and we have been
playing that game a lot over the holidays.  The campaign that comes with the
game is a joke however there are very well done modules that you can find on
the net.  That is the biggest appeal of NWN.  You literally have unlimited
possibilities since the game allows you to create your own modules.  With
EQ, you are bound by SONY's designers and frankly, that sucks.  NWN is
better suited for people who do not have the time to invest in a game like
EQ demands.  A module in NWN may be able to be completed during a Saturday
or Sunday afternoon and then you can move to another module or play a
persistent world server online.  One thing for sure, you will not face the
mundane task of killing tons and tons of mobs to level like in EQ.  A cool
feature of the game engine allows mod designers to have mobs spawn in an
area based on the level of characters in the zone.  If you clear a zone out
at level 4 and come back at level 8 thinking it will be a cakewalk, then you
are wrong.  Expect to face even harder mobs that can kill you.

SONY needs to seriously consider releasing a HOME version of the game.  Yeh,
like that has a snowball's chance in Hades to happen.  The server I use to
play on was launched in March or 1999.  The game is showing its age.  SONY
could release a HOME SERVER version and then sale HOME CLIENT account
numbers so players could host their own games.  Limit the SERVER edition so
that at the most, 32 players or so could play.  Each player would have to
have a valid CLIENT ID that would come with the HOME CLIENT.  A server would
limit the Number of Valid Client Ids to 32.  This way once 32 valid Client
Ids had logged into the SERVER then the server would be locked down and not
allow any new clients to attach to it until the person running the server
goes in and deletes a client to open up an available slot.  People could use
their Clients to log into any server that has an opening and create an
account but would not be able to connect to a server that is filled up.  The
Home Server would of course, have to be toned down.  But if they want the
Original EQ to last after EQ2, Star Wars Galaxies and the many other MMORPG
come out then they need to rethink the game and be willing to give back to
the gaming community that made them a success.
