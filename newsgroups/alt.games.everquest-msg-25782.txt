What you saw was the, errr.... "less desirable" entrance to the zone
known as "The Hole".  Having levitate on will do you no good at all. The
zone is designed so that as you zone through, it will strip you of any
levitate, flying type buffs, as well as any sort of clerical
invulnerability buffs or effects as well.  You'd have fallen a huge
distance and taken damage in the thousands or ten thousand range. 
Assuming that you *somehow* lived through that, you would have found
yourself surrounded by a number of mobs who would not have been warm and
fuzzy at all. I think the lowest level mobs in the hole are level 40+,
and they go up to the "holy shit we're all going to die" range. 
  There's another entrance down by the lake, but you'll likely need a
key to get in. Can be purchased from some bartender in Paineel for about
120 PP.  Wouldn't reccomend that zone at your level though. As to the
CR? You can either start over naked or find a high level Necro willing
to go in and summon your corpse for you, I suppose. Save aside some plat
for that, too, though.
