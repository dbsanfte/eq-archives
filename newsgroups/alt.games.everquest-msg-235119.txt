I would guess he based it by looking (guessing!?) what the average
played 65th level character is wearing; it could well be that 95% of
their equipped gear is "no drop".

Its a narrow view to be sure, and not strictly precisely what he said
he was doing. But its not an unreasonable way to look at the situation
either.
