Hmm... Okey, I'll bite. My first computer, back in the 80's, was a ZX 
Spectrum. Since then, I've owned or worked on:

-Amigas (500, 3000, 1200)
-Silicon Graphics Workstations (pretty much every one of them, from the 
Indigo to the Reality Engine. I still own an Indy)
-PCs running BeOS
-PCs running Linux (from early Slackware to Mandrake 8)
-PCs running FreeBSD and NetBSD
-PCs running Windows (95, 98, ME, 2000 and currently XP)
-Macs, Quadra running System 9 (may have been 8.5, memory is hazy) and 
G4 running OSX.

In addition, I have a very passing acquaintance with Sun workstations, 
MicroVAXen, Atari STs, Acorn Archimedes and Amstrad CPCs, having played 
with them at friends's houses.

Of all of them, my favourite by far is the G4 PowerMac running OSX 10.2.
4 I'm typing this on, followed at a certain distance by the Silicon 
Graphics machines. Now, if you think I "need help" seeing the light, and 
you want me to take your "sediments" seriously, go ahead and post *your* 
experience with Macs, rather than some 40MB video I can't be arsed to 
waste bandwidth on.

I'm listening.
