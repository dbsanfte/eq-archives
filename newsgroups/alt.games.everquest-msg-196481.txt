This is not the first time a stupid bard has done this.  One guy actually said
it was not his bad pull, which led me to believe that maybe they really *don't*
know what they are doing that they are obviously screwing up.  And of course
this loser, who didn't even apologize.   He was level 52 - old enough to know
better.
I'm thinking about sending his guild an E-mail, dammit.
