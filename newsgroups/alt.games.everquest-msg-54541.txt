Great Divide...

Kodiak Caves, if you are looking for mass exp. If you are looking for loot,
head to Kunark.

I went from 31-40 in the Kodiak Caves in about a week and a half..
seriously.. Level 35 started and ended in one night.


They are right below Velk's Lab in Great divide, along the right wall, if
heading from Thurg. You will need a large, good group and a healer.
