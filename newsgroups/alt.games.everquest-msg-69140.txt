I agree, but it still puts Barbs behind the two races with Regen.

Very few items give infra vision, and those that do are not easily
attained. Assuming the person playing the BL is not twinked, being
night blind is no small matter.  Corpse runs through dark areas are
definately a negative point against the 3 nightblind races.

Halas or rather Everfrost Peaks newbie area tops out around level 5.
If you run the bear pelt quest repeatedly and hunt Vengful Skels you
might squeeze it to 7. Then there is a pretty nasty gap out on the
tundra. You can hunt the plains fairly safely from 12 up, but 7-12 is
rough going. There are also far fewer mobs out on the tundra compared
to what the other BL races have access to. 

Black Burrow is decent (6-14), but the trains and the fact that all
the gnolls run at 25% health can make it a very frustrating experience
for a pet class without root/snare.

Compare that to the starting areas of the other BL races.

Iksar/Vah Shir have the best newbie areas in the game
Trolls/Ogres  Innothule (sp) Swamp, Entrance to  Cazic Thule, and then
moving to South Ro and Oasis. mob density is much higher, than on the
tundra.

I didn't say that Barbs were a distant 5th, but weighed against the
other BL races that do come in last.
