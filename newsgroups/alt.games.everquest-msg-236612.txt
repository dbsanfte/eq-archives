Sigh, alas I do not have LDoN or GoD but my highest char is only lvl 20 and
the only other char i have is lvl 11 so I don't really need GoD I suppose,
LDoN on the other hand I went up to WalMart 2 days ago to get it and the
<expletive deleted> were out of it.  Now I have to get shafted at EB or Best
Buy or some electronics store.
