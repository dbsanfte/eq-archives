Yeah, that's the primary point but it doesn't PROVE anything.   I agree that
Verant probably doesn't see it as an exploit, but I try to be objective
whenever I can...although Verant hasn't said it was an exploit doesn't mean
it isn't.  Verant has some of the most gifted programmers and talented
designers, but let's face it...on a lot of things, they're not rocket
scientists when it comes to details.  Hell, when Luclin came out - despite
having to go back & fix it before en masse - they STILL put a load of
misspelled words and SERIOUS grammar errors.  If they can't even do THIS
much right, what makes anyone think that they're bright enough to say "hmmm,
let's make a quest un-MQable..."
