She was using the level 39 Warder (BLs don't get a pet upgrade until
level 49). 44-48 are hell levels for BLs. Their warder reall can't
keep up with excp giving mobs. Still BL are one of the most powerful
solo classes in EQ. They just have to be more selective about the mobs
they fight between pet upgrades.
