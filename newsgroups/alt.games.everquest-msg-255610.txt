I'd have to say nothing else in the entire game is like the VT key.
Some quests are miniature versions of it, but there is no quest with
the sheer raw tedium of camping 10 shards, all of which are dropping
from mobs either in inconvenient places, far below you in power, or
with grotesquely bad drop rates, or all three of those at once. And
then even then you're not done as you need a drop from a luclin
miniboss somewhere (mostly one groupable now but not originally) and a
drop from emp ssra, a raid target who himself needs four MORE drops
from rarish spawns (other than the taskmasters). All this to get into
a zone where the mobs have seemingly millions (literally millions in
the case of the bosses) of hp, some of which split into another mob
when killed, making it by far the most boring place in EQ.

Not exactly stellar design.
