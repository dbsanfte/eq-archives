The formulas (or formulae) as I presented them are algebraically equivalent.
You have to remember the order of precedence, the multiplications and
divisions are performed first, then the additions and subtractions.  It
would probably help if I put in the unnecessary parenthesis.

Formula 1:  (Level*2)+(Level*(Wisdom/5))
Formula 2:  Level*(2+(Wisdom/5))
