Bah, Ed, Bah.  You know as well as the next person that the fashion
magazine industry as much creates the ideal as caters to it.   

First it was curvy/soft, then the anorexic look came into fashion, and
then athletic, and now fortunately you can find overly skinny, very
muscled, and very curvy women all sharing the pages of a fashion magazine.  
(THank goodness.)

Fantasy art, on the other hand, hasn't seemd to have progressed as
far.  Though, admittedly, I couldn't find a damned thing wrong with any of
Luis Royo's women during any era.  The man is a genius.

Blech.  I'd agree with you Ed, except she didn't do a good job.  *raise
hands in surrender* Except maybe I'm the freak here, but I maintain that
the current models are NOT attractive.  (Well, except vah shir.)
