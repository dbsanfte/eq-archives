Hm, that seems odd.  I'm sort of in the reverse position.  I saw the
Frostfell NPCs were back (about 12 hours before they actually announced
anything on the forums), so I did the initial pair of quests and got the
stocking.  But I still have the stocking from last year, and they're lore.

Now, I know why it's worked so far: the basic stocking is a 2-slot bag,
and what I have from last year is the 10-slot 100% WR version, and they
are really different items with the same name.  But I'm wondering what
will happen if I do the later quests to improve the new stocking?  Will
I eventually do the final turn-in and get a "duplicate lore items are not
allowed" message and lose the second stocking, or what?

I probably wouldn't have bothered repeating the quests -- was mostly
refreshing my memory of what's involved so I could decide which new alts
should do them -- but the forum post says there'll be a new quest added
this year, and I don't know if it affects the stocking or not!

With the release of SoF, the stationeries used for spell research were
supposed to start dropping off caster-type mobs everywhere, instead of
just in TSS and DoDH zones.  I know there was a problem with some levels
of the stuff, which got fixed a couple weeks back; didn't know there was
still an issue with level 60-64, but I guess there was.
