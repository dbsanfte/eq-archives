recently a group of people "attempted" the 10th ring war and failed on
prexus.  When i went to zone from Thurg to Icewell i ended up in SG and
died.  I don't know if anything like that happened there but some odd things
have happened recently with zoning, so maybe those other groups were put
near the Mistress after zoning.
