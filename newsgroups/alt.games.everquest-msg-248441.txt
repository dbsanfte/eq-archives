For AFK swimming with enduring breath, I used to put my cleric at the bottom
of the pool in Kaladim (outside the warrior guild) and let him swim into a
wall. Worked great for me. For non-AFK swimming, the best zones would be
Lake Rathetear, Ocean of Tears, or Timorous Deep (at least they worked for
me, YMMV).
