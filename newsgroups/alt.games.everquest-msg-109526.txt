Learn the difference between general and universal.

Virtually everyone looking for the easy ride through EQ takes the
halfling druid route.

Other race/class combos with questionable reps:

gnome wizard
wood elf druid
barbarian warrior

They aren't all bad. They probably aren't even mostly bad. But when
you run into a twit, its more likely to be one of those four than
anything else. In my experience, at least.

Alternatively, there's some combos that seem to lead to nice people
more often than others. Troll warriors, shorty clerics, most dwarves
of any class, hybrids, enchanters before they become embittered over
non-assisters, non pure caster gnomes to name a few.

They just don't seem as popular with antisocial nimrods, on the
servers I've been on.
