Ok, this isn't to answer you, but to ask a follow-up after stating the
following:
Man! Did I almost SERIOUSLY FUCK UP!!!!  I have spent a number of sessions
killing hill giants and various other money producing activities so that my
partner and I could save up some semi-significant cash. I'm over the 4K PP mark
now, and since I was near FP on my way back from a guild raid, I stopped off at
East Auctionlands. I've been looking and looking to buy a pair of Yaks, since
through all my days of playing my warrior I heard how good they were.
  After reading this post, I went back and looked on alakhazam's at the list of
weapons by ratio.  SURPRISE! My current (crappy) weapons are listed as being
*BETTER* thant he SSoY!  I almost blew a couple grand for a *downgrade*.
  So here's what my current 1HS combo is.  Icetooth's Claws and Blackened Alloy
Longsword. I think they are 11/29 and 10/29.  Either way, both are listed as
better than the Yak.  But I still hunger to upgrade for better damage output
when dual weilding.
   I'm only 43 and don't yet get many opportunities to hunt with 50+ groups
where the *really* sweet stuff starts to drop, so I guess I'm forced to still
shop for what I want.
  What are some good weapons better than my current pair of 1HS  that I might
be able to afford in the under 5K range and might realistically be found for
sale?
  I'd also consider a non-1HS if it was good enough. My 1HB is still pathetic,
but I have finally nearly maxed out my piercing.  Have to max them all before
hitting 50 anyway, so I guess my options are wide open on the weapons form, as
long as it's one hand. (Preferably *either* primary or secondary, but I guess I
can switch around as needed. If it's not slashing, secondary is preferred at
least until I can get my skills maxed.)
