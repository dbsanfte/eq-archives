Even in EQ1, a lot more group combinations were probably viable than people
were willing to play.  An all-Warrior group in EQ1 would have actually
worked out pretty well, but people usually wouldn't try something like
that.  (Here's some notes I wrote up on why it would work:
http://www.tzs.net/melee/melee.html).

It sounds like in WoW people are willing to try more things now.  It will be
interesting to see how that holds up, as people figure out what works best.
If having a healer would have made your group 5% better, most people at this
stage of the game's life would not insist on a healer...but what about a
year from now?
