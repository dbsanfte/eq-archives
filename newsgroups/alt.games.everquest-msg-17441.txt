Not quite a myth, not entirely.  This myth has it's origin's from an in-game Quest.
If you kill a certain reptile in Innothule Swamp, using any sort of 1HS or 2HS weapon, the skin
will NOT drop.  I had this confirmed via a GM, in-game, after many repeated-begs from a friend
doing the quest.  Sorry, I won't offer any spoilers on the quest, other than if you know which
one it is, you know which one I mean.
