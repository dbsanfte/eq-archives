uses only 32 k bytes or so of memory and zero cpu time, prevents
windows key from doing anything even if you hit it. I have a shortcut
to it in my start menu so it starts with windows. Also, if you want to
use the windows key for some reason you just run it again from startup
and it removes itself and you can.
