If you are referring to the 1 character limit on the Fironia Vie
(Role-Playing Preferred) server, the answer is simple.

1. Forces players to "live and die" by their reputations. It forces
players to invest all of their time and energy into 1 character.

2. Cuts down on twinking and farming

This was true in the begining at least

In reality it encourages many players to keep and maintain more than 1
account in order to play on the server and have at least one other
"alt" character. At this point, Sony would most likely lose money if
they added character slots to the server. Some die-hard FV players
would quit in anger (the server would lose part of it's uniqueness),
and many others would stop paying for multiple accounts, since they
could run their alts on 1. I don't think adding slots to the server
would attract enough new players to offset the loss.
