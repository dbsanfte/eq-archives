I was in the paludal caverns building up some defense skill on the sensate
reishi's when some of the Bandit Camp jackasses started getting into an OOC
tiff about who <owned> the camp. I have spent a lot of time in Paludal on
many different characters and there has always been two groups to a
particular camp, seeing that they have around 20 mobs and a high repop rate.

Jackass 1:    "hey - we OWN bandit one, that means we are camping it, we
have the mobs, understand Jackass 2"

Jackass 2:    "I take what I want when I want, I am not asking you"

*etc*

*eventually*

Moi:    "Why don't you guys share? There has always been 2 groups to a camp
when I have been here. It's just that OOC here is starting to sound like EC"

Jackass 1:    "We are raping this camp - we will killsteal all"

Moi:    "/report jackass 1

Jackass 2:    "Yeah - well I am getting sick of your OOC as well - if you
don't like what is said turn your OOC off"

Moi:    "Heh - read what you just wrote : )"

*shakes head*

Paludal caverns, The new East Commons Orc camps...
