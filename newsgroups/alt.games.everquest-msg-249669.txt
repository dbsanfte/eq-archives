I think it may also have something to do with his being a crazy mofo.  How 
much weight that should carry in these cases is also subject to opinion, 
of course.  But generally, our country has not used the death penalty on 
the provably, obviously, insane.

Of course, it's arguable that killing someone is clear evidence of 
insanity, and that's where it all falls down, but hey.

Well, it's arguably self defence.  Or defence of the individuals that make 
the state up.  But I agree, in principle, with the thrust of your 
argument.
