Shaman / SK - SK's get a snare and a fear.  For two boxing you'd have to
chase the mob with the SK to keep them hitting it.  That can be a pain.
Shaman pet would auto follow the mob though.
Shaman / Necro - Both get self mana regen, necro pet works well.  Necro can
snare and fear.  Both get pets.  Should be reasonably easy to two box.

I read somewhere they just nerfed shammy slows.  I don't know the details
behind that, but the shammy slow is what makes it possible to go from 50-60.

Duo'ing with a Chanter I think would be hard.  I triple botted with a
warrior / druid / chanter and that worked well.  However when things went
bad, usually the chanter died.  They have the toughness of wet toilet paper.
