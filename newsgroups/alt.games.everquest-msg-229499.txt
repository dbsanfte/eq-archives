Close. The concept is correct, but a avg of 47 will get you a level 45
dungeon and an average of 48 will net you a 50 dungeon ;)

On a different note, ive noticed something odd with the merchants and
points. Me and my wife both have the same number of points earned in
Miraguls - yet she can see all the way up to the 1492 items, and I can
only see 1150. The only difference being that I spent 760 on the
Malevolent BP a bit ago, and shes been saving up. It was my
understanding that you needed to have an amount of points earned to
unlock merchant items but not unspent points. Looks like they have to
be unspent too =/.
