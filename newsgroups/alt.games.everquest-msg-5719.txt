Let's think about that.  15k would buy about 125 10-charge SOW potions.
SOW from a druid/shaman/ranger lasts 36 minutes.  I don't know if
potions are the same, but let's assume they are.  1250 charges times 36
minutes/charge is 45000 minutes of SOW, or 750 hours of SOW, or 31.25
days.

Note that as you get to higher levels, you spend more time in dungeons
where SOW (and jboots) cannot be cast, so you'd probably get at least 50 or
60 days /played time out of 1250 SOW potions.

I'd say if you had 15k plat to spend, buying SOW potions would be a
better use than buying MQ'ed jboots.
