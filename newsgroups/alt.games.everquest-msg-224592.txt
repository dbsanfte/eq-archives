Well for starters unless for some reason you've scattered your group to 
the 4 winds, '/who name' is all that's required. The all is only needed 
to search 'outside' your zone.

Even simpler is to simply target them and type /whot

But you'll find that many people are anonymous ... the best thing to do 
is just ask. Although at higher levels you'll rapidly be able to deduce 
who's who just by there weapons, race, what they are casting (or not 
casting), pets, etc...
