Well, Ive got my cleric up to 38 now.... working on 39.
I started a Woodelf Druid, who is presently in the East Commons.
He is level 5 now.  Ive been killing firebeetles and spiders (conning
blue to me).  I see alot of natures creatures but keep hearing druids
say dont kill Wolves, Bears...  etc...
What can I kill solo without destroying faction that I will need
later?
What should I not kill? and why if you please.

Your time is appreciated.
