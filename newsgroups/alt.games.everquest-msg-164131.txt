    What improvements do melees get when they ding 63, again? Hopefully you
won't count a monk's hands improving, seeing as how you just crapped all
over them using bare hands in another thread.

    Casters do get some gains from level, like certain spells that scale in
a very minor way post-60 and ability to channel/not fizzle older spells. I
don't know that it's enough to justify spells being rarish drops as opposed
to vendor purchases, but then again I haven't compared DPS increase due to
lower fizzle rate on level 60 nukes versus DPS increase from mainhand bonus
increase.

    I did the trials once (I'm not flagged for Seventh Hammer). Me, WAR,
WAR, MNK, WIZ, SHM. They'd all tried before and failed with a second-box
cleric. They didn't fail with me. MNK went LD partway through, but came back
in time for the final wave and executioner. Based on that (monk being gone
for part of the trial, we still win) I'd say that we could have replaced the
monk with any other person and got them through the trials. That's how we've
been moving some people through that have difficulty, by putting them in
"ringer" groups with five flagged people.

    See above. The people that have done all six have said that other trials
are more suited to classes that don't have high DPS, but I don't have the
first-hand experience to confirm that.

    The rapid change in what is blue and what constitutes "good XP" is
unfortunate, but it has had a good effect on the old zones that were turned
into solo slums by level 60's. My best friend is a 53 rogue, and he's been
in Sebilis for the first time ever this past week. Two or three groups in
the zone, pulls galore, the best XP he's ever seen in his life. That's the
way it should be, not one group claiming "upper Sebilis" or a solo monk
claiming the entire Disco area.

    As for "decent XP zone", there's places in all the first-tier zones
where XP is fair, if not as exceptional as second-tier zones. I went to
level 62 in one ten or eleven hour session in the castle in PoD. Crypt
Keeper was up, we didn't pull from that interior area, and for the last half
of the day we had a rival group set up downstairs just outside the entry,
pulling some of what we pulled previously. Going to Valor, I'd say I could
have done the same level in two thirds the time. So the efficiency change is
big, but you're still pulling in XP at a fantastic rate compared to
non-planar areas. Oh, that castle stuff looked to still be blue at 65.

    So that means we should complain about stuff that we think might someday
get nerfed as if it will be nerfed? The fastest way to get Verant to nerf
something is to repeat over and over "this is too good, they'll nerf it"
until the devs start to believe it, too. Especially since saying you think
it'll be nerfed means you'll ACCEPT the nerf when it happens, as it won't be
a rude shock.
