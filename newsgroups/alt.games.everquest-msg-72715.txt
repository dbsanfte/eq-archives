You want at least 512MB RAM (and I HEAR that more makes a big difference).
You want a video card with the VERY least 32MB RAM (GeForce2MX comes to
mind) preferably 64MB.

Check out www.pricewatch.com.  Keep in mind that a LOT of vendors lie out
their ass about shipping cost so you'll have to check a few sites to
actually get the lowest price.  I recently bought a GeForce2 Ti (probably
the best GeForce2, but the technology is getting old...but I can't afford a
GF3) with 64MB DDR RAM for $112 including shipping.  You can get a
GeForce2MX 400 (64MB of cheaper quality RAM) for probably a little more than
half that.  Considering the lack of speed increase I'd probably go with the
MX400 if I had to do it over again.

Your CPU is fast enough, no worries there.
