Not yet.  There probably won't be until after the first few patches (They
still haven't "officially" released the first patch yet, but Lionhead
apprently got tired of fighting with EA QA and realeased an unsupported

We'll have to see if it holds on long enough for them to bother with The
Gathering and B&W Worlds.
