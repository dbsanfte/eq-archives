All of the classes are extremely well balanced. Some are better sub-50
and others are better post-50. But over all there isn't any one class
that is useless or "broken" currently.

That being said the "most broken" class would be Wizards in my
opinion. They are just too 1 dimensional. Nuke/Port, that's about it.
All other classes (escpecially other Wis/Int casters) have much more
rounded talents and abilities.

I am not saying that Wizards are not a good class, or not worth
playing. In the right situation a Wizard can be the best class, but
these situations are few and far between compared to the typical EQ
exp grind. I am just expressing my opinion based on the relative
skills and attributes of the classes in EQ.
