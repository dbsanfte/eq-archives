Depends on the city.  You can live very easily without a car in NYC.  You 
can live fairly easily without a car in several US cities (Boston, Philly, 
Chicago, SF, DC, etc).  Other than that, you pretty much need a car to get 
around reliably.  The distances are much, much greater than the average 
Euro urban area, with less population density, so transit is generally 
less effective.

Well, yes and no.  Because effective transit is generally only available 
in the most urban of urban areas, and because urban areas are frightening 
to many people in the US, a certain rather reactionary segment of the 
population finds any type of transit the logical precurser to black 
helicopters and mind-control rays.  
In NYC at least, there is very little class distinction regarding transit.  
Well, the ultra-wealthy don't use it much, but almost every person who 
lives in Manahattan at least uses it frequently.

2 cars in NYC, less disposable income for everything, and I still take the 
subway every day  :(
