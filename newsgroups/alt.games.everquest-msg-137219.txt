I perceive a social obligation not to make off with someone else's gear. 
I will not argue the point that what the drop-twinker did was stupid, 
but I don't buy the argument that dropping something on the ground for 
the puposes of twinking equals relinquishing ownership of it.

As a hypothetical case, if someone, say, in North Freeport told the zone 
"I'm going to drop a bag in front of the bank for a minute, and I will 
pick it up with a Gnome Mage called Yebernik as soon as I can log him in, 
so please don't touch it", would you feel perfectly justified in 
grabbing it and taking off?

Good point, except for the fact that someone who is camping is not 
expected to log, but someone who is drop-twinking absolutely has no 
choice but to do so. Again, I'm not arguing that the Bazaar on patch day 
is an ideal place for it.

He made off with stuff that didn't belong to him. Call it what you will.

That is entirely your privilege.

On the whole, I'm glad to hear that.
