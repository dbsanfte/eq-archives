Fighting the unslowed, level 70 version of Lhranc for a guildmate's SK 
epic, we found he was hitting too hard and too fast for the limited 
healer support we had available.

Earlier, when the clerics were discussing setting up a healing rotation, 
and the shamans were setting up a malosi/slow/cripple rotation, I 
jokingly suggested we set up a FD rotation on the SK channel (more SK at 
the event than any other class.

Well, during the fight it was clear we did NOT have enough healers, 
tanks were dropping one after another.  All tanks still alive were 
taunting like mad, and the ping ponging was one of the only reasons we 
still had tanks; we'd get hit a few times, Lhranc would switch to his 
next target, and then a heal would land and we were back in business.

When it was my turn, though, I got slapped around so hard and fast that 
I was down in Low HP aggro territory, with my next heal about three 
seconds out (all heals were announce in channel).

I did something I haven't done in a fight in 40+ levels; I FD'd.  Lhranc 
switched to another tank, my heal landed, I stood up and took aggro back.

WHen other tanks got down to low HP, they just died, which meant aggro 
switched off of them anyway.  I was about to die, there's no doubt at 
all in my mind.  By FDing, I made time for that heal to land, and thus 
was able to stand back up, fully buffed, no rez effects, pet still 
fighting, and heck, I even had all the hate I'd generated... got him 
right back on me no trouble at all.

So I'm going back to my original joking comment; FD rotation.  Might be 
something to the idea, for some targets; we're an SK rich guild, after 
all, if we can set things up so that MT, ST, TT are all at the top of 
the aggro list, then any one of us could FD long enough to get healed 
without seriously detracting from the fight.

Just a wacky idea, but I'll have to give it more thought see if there's 
something to it for more than the odd situation like the one we just 
found ourselves in.

Berg, 60 SK, MT FD
