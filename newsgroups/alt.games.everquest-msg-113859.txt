I was under the impression that there were two completely different
development teams for the two games.  If this is true, then no one is
being two-faced.  One development team has one PoV, another has a
different one.

Also, consider that in EQ2, there may not be any such thing as a
"Rez".  So while you don't loose whatever exp you started with, there
may be no convenient way of reducing the Exp "deficit" except by
getting more exp.  Ultimately, whichever route they pick, I doubt
advancement will occur any faster than in EQ2.  Yes, I know they've
said that they will have faster advancement, but they will also have
more levels IIRC.  So ultimately, it'll prob take you just as long to
get to the highest lvl in EQ2 as it did in EQ1.  If that is the case,
then everything else is just presentation, and doesly really impact
the time it takes to "max out" your character.
