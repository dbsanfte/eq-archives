I never heard of that, and I've done more than 50 LDON adventures on Saryrn.
I do generally encourage setting aside a gem to give to the cleric as
compensation for dot usage, because I'm doing mid/high 50s groups and hence
Temp is expected of the cleric. I often am ML and I give the cleric a
middling gem that will sell for maybe 60 to 80pp, and I don't worry about if
they get a little profit on that versus how many dots they used, and clerics
are always grateful.

I don't offhand think I've come across a cleric who openly expected or
requested the gem deal, let alone a fixed extra loot split. I think you just
ran into a jerk, and if she keeps that attitude up she won't be able to find
groups.

If clerics ever actually got so irreplaceable that such extra splits became
regular practice, Sony would nerf them (and rightly so).
