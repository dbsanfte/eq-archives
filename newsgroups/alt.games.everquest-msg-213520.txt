i don't know if this information will help at all, but here goes...

one time, two years ago, i was zoning to saftey in upper guk, from lower
guk....as i was about to zone back ( i was un Uguk for about 2 minutes real
time), i suddenly noticed my fps dropped to 5 or something terrible and
unplayable, just like a virus/virus-killer program had started up

(there was nothing running .. nothing changed... i had gone from normal play
to a grinding 5 fps instantly)

i zoned to Lguk, and everything was fine for a moment, then it happened
again

i died

i repopped in FV, and everything was fine gfx-wise (heh, took me 3 hours to
get my corpse, and i lost 2 blues...and that was a *lot* back then)

i NEVER removed my guk.s3d files, noticed them being patched, had anything
running, did anything stupid like spill soda on my mobo....

my system was (and still is, YAY) 733mhz HP (ewwww)

my game just became intolerable for those few minutes

i imagine you shouldn't *need* to do anything since -based on what you said-
you didn't actually *do* anything to cause the fps problem

i hope it straightens itself out for you

(btw don't petition about deaths caused by this =P)
