Of course we consider that. However, you don't accomplish the level of
world community and diplomatic relations the U.S enjoys with a history
of unprovoked aggression. With that in mind, I strongly believe that
in any decision those in power in the U.S. make of this nature, the
ramifications have been well considered and weighed against any
reasons for aggression.

And if you think that other nations with the power to do so wouldn't
strike back at any of those they believed were at the bottom of a
cowardly attack such as those of 9/11, you are delusional. What has
happened in the past is irrelevant. The U.S. had reason to aid Iraq at
various times.

A common insistence of those against the war. I disagree as does the
U.S. government.

If by "a threat to U.S. interests" you mean a threat to allies of the
U.S., then yes, I agree. Wouldn't you intervene to help your allies?
The anti-war community is using the fact that the U.S. gains
economically from our helping Saudi Arabia and defending our own
shores from terrorism. I say, *bonus*. However, just because we do
benefit in this way does not prove that this benefit is the driving
force behind our actions here.

I will agree with the fact that we would be much better served by
something like a videotape of Hussein handing a truckload of money and
bombs over to Bin Laden, but that's not going to happen. We can't be
intimidated by the threat of terrorism simply because we can't provide
irrefutable evidence. If enough other factors indicate we are right in
our assumptions, our aggression is justified.

We are not a whipping post. Understand that.

Rumble <--- would like to know exactly what Pax Americana means
