At my level, possibly this isn't a problem yet.  Possibly.

My experience of being a cleric has probably colored my view on all this.
When I hit the mid-20's, I dropped out of EQ.  To say I hated groups would
have been an understatement.  I got sick of being treated like a mana sponge
and poorly at that.  There were good group members but they weren't on often
enough.  Looting was beyond a pain.  Everyone was bitching over how it was
to be done.  Ninja looting was rampant.  Loot orders lasted maybe until the
next new group member was added.  Everyone knew how to play each other
characters and no one was good at their own.  A very sophomoric time.  I
just got sick of it.  EQ was no longer fun and I play computer games to have
fun and not to be stressed out.  EQ is a GAME.  Too many people seemed to
have forgotten this fact when I was in my mid-20's.

However, I had real life friends that are in EQ constantly trying to get me
to come back.  Eventually I did but in a limited way.  I took a break from
grouping to level and went after WIS items.  A relaxed route.  Anyone try
and tell me how to play my cleric or use the word "HEAL" and I'd tell them
to stop and if they didn't, I dropped out of the group.  Didn't care less if
it left the group at the bottom of a dungeon.  So what.  I gated.

As I've said before, this has colored my view of things.  Maybe looting is
different at higher levels, but it sucks at my level.  Sure you can bully
your group into doing what you want the loot order to be.  I've done it, but
it's no fun.  I don't get paid to play EQ so if it isn't fun, I don't do it.
I've found a much easier approach is just not looting at all.  What money I
make is off of what's randomed.  I only save money for my spells because I
can't also save up for gear.  I hunt for my gear.

Now comes along the symbol spells.  Are they a benefit?  Yes, but they're
expensive.  Because I get short-changed on loot because Verant doesn't make
auto-split fair to all members of a group, I refuse to blow my bank account
on the tanks that are getting the plat out of the loot while I literally get
the coppers.  If I had been casting symbol spells all the time I "should"
have been casting them, I don't know if I'd have any money left in my bank
account.

For example, just last night I spent over 75 plat getting 80 jaspers.  I
bought this because I was going to group with a RL friend and we were going
to hunt for WIS gear for his shammy and my cleric.  Not sure what I'll now
do in groups.  That 75 plat plus the 20 plat for the spell took out a huge
chunk in my bank account ... in addition to another 100+ plat for five other
spells.  Right now I'm going after other WIS gear so I'll think it over and
decide.  I think what I might do is ask groups that invite me how the loot
is handled.  The most common method at my level is free for all (FFA).
Personally, I'd want to tell them that if that's the loot system than
they'll have to accept a cleric that doesn't cast symbol spells.  But then I
can see them asking what would I accept for a loot division.  To be honest,
I just don't know.  Wolfie suggested a loot-all-coins, but I feel that robs
other casters that use up components for their spells and will just tick off
the tanks.  Also don't like the money-grubbing image that will cast me in.
Just don't know.

Yes, tanks have surprised lately me in telling me not to buff them or anyone
else in the group so my downtime is as little as possible.  That others do
the buffing.  However, since I'm normally the group leader these days
(though rarely the original group leader but almost always the one when the
group regroups because leader leaves or goes LD), I like keeping a variety
of classes in my groups.  Normally, two to three tanks, a chanter or bard, a
shammy or druid, and, sometimes in place of a third tank, a nuker.

Maybe it is because my low level, but I've never had a tank not make it back
to the group yet.  And I can't remember the time a tank came back so beaten
up by a pull that I had to cast on them when they first returned.
