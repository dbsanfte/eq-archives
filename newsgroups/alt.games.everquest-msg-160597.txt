the biggest factor in determining what the minimum CHA is to bottom
out prices is the vendor greed factor.

case study: metal bar merchants in shadowhaven.
my enchanter has run the "register for trading" quest several times
(don't like having to grab that damn amulet from the bank any time i
want to sell there), and is up to ally with the allonodes (garn
allonode sells the metal bars used in jewelcraft; he's just across
from the bazaar zoneline in shadowhaven).  even with CHA over 150, his
prices still suck.
so i hit eqtraders and found another merchant with the same items, but
hidden away back in the caster's library in shadowhaven.  indifferent
faction, CHA around 125, and the prices on her are min/maxxed.

same thing in kelethin: spent a while in crushbone building up emerald
warriors faction.  up to something like kindly now with them on pretty
much all my characters.  but even with CHA up to the 150s i still
don't get best prices.  if i run around to the gem merchant there
(tucked away about 5 platforms from the lifts), i get best prices even
without using faction spells (he's not on any of the factions raised
by killing orcs) or CHA spells.

this has been a special report by Mystarr.
