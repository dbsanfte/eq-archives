    I have my enchanter up to 31. I'll share my twink philosophies with you,
and hopefully be corrected by the more senior enchanters here. ;-)

    At a couple hundred plat per slot, we should end up with a well-done
twink.

    At low level, most of the gear you get will already have solid AC for
the level, so ignore this as a consideration. Go HP/MANA/CHA at first.

    Once you have a robe on, most of your other gear won't show. Be aware of
that.

    Find a jeweler in EC. Ask for a package deal on Gold Jade bracers,
Electrum Black Sapphire earrings and Velium Fire Wedding Rings. The price
should come in under 2 K, and that's 230 HPs of gear. Other slots:

Off Hand: Stein of Moggok. 10 INT, some HPs, dirt cheap.
Main Hand: Mithril Quill for piercing, Rod of Insidious Glamour for 1HB. The
Rod will last you a long time, both weapons have near-integer delays for
timing chain-stuns.
Head: Runed Circlet, or Savant's Cap if money gets tight.
Face: Spend the cash, or get an enchanter friend to help, and get an
Incandescent Mask. It will last you a LONG time.
Neck: Splitpaw Tooth Necklace.
Shoulders: Embroidered Black Cape.
Arms: Gatorscale Sleeves, or Embroidered Black Sleeves if you can find a
pair (fairly rare).
Waist: not important, Lizardscale Belt if you can find one.
Gloves: Dusty Bloodstained Gloves.
Legs:Drakescale Leggings.
Boots: depending on cash, Kobold Hide Boots (cheap) or Wolf Fur Slippers
(expensive)
Back: Kunzar Cloak
Ranged Slot: Dustscryer's Crystal Ball.

    OK, time for the robe. How much cash do you have left? ;-) If you're
very tight on cash, a Green Silken Drape is dirt cheap, has a nice resist
for low levels, and the off-stats on it will help get you to 75 in some
ignored areas (for skill training). It looks like the high elf enchanter
newbie robe, which is good for blending in but bad if you want to be
noticed. The "one step up" from there would be an Oracle Robe. Very striking
appearance, and has a nice amount of plus MANA on it. Another robe in that
range of usefulness would be the Advisor Robe, which is quite stunning
visually - and usually overpriced because of it. Crystal Covered Shrouds are
common in EC, but are VERY plain to look at. If you have the cash for it,
though, I think your twink should go for a Blackened Crystalline Robe - INT
and CHA, and a unique look. Crystalline Robes are also good and unique
looking, but no CHA.
