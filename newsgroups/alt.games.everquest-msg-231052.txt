No.  They didn't proc for my level 49 Shaman pet for example which I
expected as the check is versus the level of the pet not the caster
and Shaman pets are pretty low level until True Spirit.  Friend told
me his 49 Beastlord pet wouldn't proc them either but my 53 Necro pet
did (or at least I wasn't getting "your pet lacks the will" messages.)
