Ah, the infernal (I'd say "eternal" but I like my choice better) question!

Got a couple choices.

1) What you suggested
2) AE mez 'em all and ask questions later (low on my list if there's only 2
or 3)
3) wait a few seconds before mezzing the second critter and compare its hp
with the other.  The one with the higher hps, mez.  This is my preferred
method though I use #4 more often <g>.
4) Just mez SOMETHING and hope that you picked the right one.  I'd say it
works about half the time and never fails to earn a few "oooohs" and
"aaaahs" from your group mates 'cause of your unbelievable intelligence. <g>
Little do they know....

Then there's the question, "how the hell do I TARGET that add when some
fat-assed ogre has me pinned in the corner???"  I'll let you in on a secret
I learned here...hit F9 once and adjust the view if necessary.   It's easier
to target specific critters from above.
