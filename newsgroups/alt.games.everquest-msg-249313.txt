It certainly was for shits and giggles; unless your going to try to 
suggest that 'rape & sodomize the prisoners' is the standard military 
interpretation of 'soften the prisoners up for interrogation'... 
assuming there even were orders.

Keep telling yourself that. You've convinced yourself. A lot of people 
disagree. Its a value judgement, not a universal truth. Not everyone has 
such a genial attitude to getting raped and sodomized as you.
