Personally I like grouping with those of higher level.  My Bard gets
in groups of high level players as mana-pump and to do crowd control
sometimes.  I always get great XP because of the faster kill rate.
Though crowd control is not my favorite thing to do, but a Bard's
job is to crowd control when no chanter is available.

 Besides I like it when those of many levels more complement me on
my ability to play my character.  Which I attribute to being scared
to death ;-) .
