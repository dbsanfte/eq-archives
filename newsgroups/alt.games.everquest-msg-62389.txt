    Agreed. But that wasn't the issue here.

    And THAT was the original poster's question: "Why aren't there mana
regen items like there are haste items?"

    And there's the original poster's answer. 8)

    That's what our top guild seems to do - "Hey, it's your turn to make a
cleric twink!" They have about a dozen level 56 plus clerics that are
regulars, and maybe a half dozen level 56 plus cleric alts for when the
main's class isn't required. Included in the half dozen is a few "community
clerics". If Donal's wasn't nerfed, they'd have already killed Tunare.

    You assume you can DO the job, though. As long as you control aggro, a
Donal's team NEVER goes OOM. Doesn't matter how long the fight is, the
clerics will still be CHealing away. Take the infamous Lodizal example -
does your guild presently have a two-character team that can drop Lodizal?

    Donal's teams start the heal chain with BPs, not set it up once they go
OOM. Other clerics / healers cover with spam heals until the BP chain kicks
in. It isn't part of the strat, it IS the strat.
