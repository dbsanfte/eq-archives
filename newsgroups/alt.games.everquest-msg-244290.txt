The funny part is this.. if you actually make a living selling and
trading EQ items.. the last thing you want to see is a macro sploit or
bug unless and until you are the only one that takes advantage of it.
And that is very rarely. I would suggest if you were smart that the
moment as a trader you saw a macro sploit/bug you report it and beat
down the GM's until they fix it. Introducing billions of plat into the
economy only drives the price you get for that plat down.

What usually tends to happen, especially in Everquest is you get
undercutters that think they're so slick by cutting the price until
they sell something. If you buy it and put it up for normal price..
what basically happens is the undercutter pays you a chunk of what he
should have gotten in return for being able to sell it fast.

Also, i don't believe in any way that the prices in the bazaar 'force'
people to go buy PP online. At 65, there are many myraid ways of being
able to generate cash and enough pp out there going around that any
level 65 player should know what they can afford and what they can't.
If they decide to go buy it offline due to having an excess in US
cash, that was certainly their choice but they were not asked to, nor
required to do so.

>If you don't want to pay his prices, don't buy.

Good mantra. But if people are paying his prices, they won't change.
