It's a pain, but doable - IF one of the mobs isn't on the pet.  If it is
you have to step in close to it to get it on you - pet back off followed
by pet kill

These should ALWAYS be hotkeyed for pet classes.  Both my mage and my BL 
have
1- Pet kill
2- pet report health
3- pet back off
4- assist
5- pet guard here
6- pet guard me

These are the *essential* commands that you can't mess around with typing.

So, if the BL is tanking, and a mob taunts off the pet -

Step close to the second mob to get aggro (a pet can't keep aggro if you're
in melee range - unless the pet is under 20% health or thereabouts, then
mobs don't run or taunt off.)

/pet back off
pause
/pet kill

Spam pet kill - sometimes the other mob is the first to hit you after the
pet backs off, and he needs the reminder to go after your target.
