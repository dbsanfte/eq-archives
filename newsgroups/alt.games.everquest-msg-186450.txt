Untrue.  I enjoy going to the lake, but I hate the hour drive to and from
the lake.  Some days, it's enough to make me change my plans and play golf
instead.

No numerical advancement associated with going to the lake.  No reason to go
other than to lay around with my friends and have fun.

Oh no!  Now I'm a 'Power Lake Go-er To-er', right?

You see how silly that sounds?

You forget, Ben .. having fun is an accomplishment, too.
