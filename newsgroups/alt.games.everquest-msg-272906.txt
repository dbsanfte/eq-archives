You are incredibly naive or your schools haven't taught you much
history, much of it less than 100 years old. Some of it less than 40
years ago.

I have seen it.

Its not anecdotal.

I didn't think of it when I made the original post, but look up
Segregation in the U.S. Look up lots of court cases, probably well
over 1,000,000 people jailed without being charged with anything.
Well, being a minority within the city limits after sunset. But it
wasn't written down anywhere as being a law. And people did go to
jail for being in that situation. No trial. No formal charges. Just
put in jail to 'teach them a lesson'. It happened.

That you think its anecdotal shows your lack of knowledge.

Seriously.  I  have repeatedly said 'if he made a valid complaint,
what they did was wrong'.

If he screamed and cussed, then they were correct.

And no, thats not a backpedal. Reread what I wrote.
