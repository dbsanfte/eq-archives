Are you using a WinModem? If so get a modem that is not a WinModem as
that type depends on software to pretend to be a modem (it's a digital
signal processor that uses software to tell it how to be a modem) and
if you have less than optimum processor or ram it can cause connection
problems on high video demanding zones. With timing being so important
with the modem if your computer pages the modem software out of ram
and into your hard drive you will get a lot of timeouts on data
transfers. Get a U.S.Robotics or other high quality modem.
Here is a URL that takes you to TigerDirects page to see what I mean.

I'd buy it at a local shop if I were you so you can exchange it in
case you have problems with it instead of waiting for a mail exchange.
