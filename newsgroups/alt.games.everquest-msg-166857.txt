I don't know why everyone thinks that the Bard is the hardest to play.  It's
certainly a "busy" class to play, but not hard IMHO.  You can usually get
away easily (unless you get a chance meeting with Gore in DL like I did last
night.  "Careful, I have Gore on track" I said to my group.  Famous last
words.  We were all nuked about 2 seconds after I sent that message, hehe),
faction isn't a big issue, groups are easy to get into, soloing is cake.
I would say that of all the classes I've played, the Shaman was the hardest
for me to even get to level 10.  I don't know why, but it was hard even at
the lowest levels.  I gave up at level 12.
