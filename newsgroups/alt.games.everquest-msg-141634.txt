You're probably right.  Sometimes they get to be a bit of a blur to me.  Too
many fights that are too similar, except this one rampages and that one
flurries instead, this one quad hits for 300 and that one dual hits for
600...

True, true.  I think the paladin must have either been sleeping on the job,
or was somewhat new to raiding (at least that raid) and didn't really
comprehend the amount of damage that was being put out.    I didn't meant to
say a warrior would drop before LoH went off.

No, you're right.   I guess I was just misunderstanding what we were arguing
about. : )

I was just saying the general wasn't really that easy of a fight.   If he
had a decent amount of hit points instead of Kunark level, he'd be
dangerous.
