No way.  He's doing a lot more than 1/4 of the damage, pre-50.  He has
a 20/22 weapon, which is better than any untwinked Paly has at that
level, he can have 1hb and offense at 175, vs 200 for a Paly.  The
only real difference is no double-attack.  I'm not sure of the
formula, but if it works like dual-weild, it's about 25-30% of the
total damage.  I would say it's higher though, since you will get
main-hand attack bonus with double attack.  Still, it's less than 50%
of the damage even with 235 skill, so well under 50% at 200 skill.

Please cite references on this.  If you have other hits on, you should
see all other hits, as long as you're close enough (melee range).

So does another Pally with 20/30 1hd weapon.  Which is about the
damage that Berg is bringing.

Hell, my favorite cleric looks like an SK (well, she did before her
green M&M bp), has a kick-ass weapon that procs lifetap, and likes
meleeing.  She's not going to do it on a dragon-raid, but for EXP
groups everyone gets to melee.  Hell, we even have a couple mages who
melee in certain situations.  Every bit counts.
