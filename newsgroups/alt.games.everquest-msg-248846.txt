Reanimating the dead is one of the things the Vahz do.  What probably
happened is one of the others reanimated the one you killed, and you missed
it in the heat of battle.  I think what Bob described is different--it
sounds like in his case there was no other mob around, so the dead mob
reanimated itself.

One of the things I do as a Controller if I come across a group of mobs
while soloing that is too big for me to handle is use Confuse on the
toughest one, so he'll take out some of the others.  I do this a couple
times and let him thin the crowd out, then I attack.  With the Vahz, it
doesn't always work, because the one I confuse might kill one, and then as
soon as Confuse wears off, he bends down and goes to work reanimating it!
