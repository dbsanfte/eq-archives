Just a thought: perhaps the 'warmly' con resulted when you had a
merchant targeted instead of a trainer. If memory serves, Ogres
do start out warmly with the Oggok merchants but only amiably
with their guildmasters.

CraknekWarriors is indeed the Ogre Warrior guild, so you are gaining
faction with them. It does take generally quite a bit of work to go 
from amiable to kindly (next step up). Greenbloods are the Ogre
Shadowknights. There's a sign outside their room which reads
"Greenblood Guild". The Bouncers are on the Clurg faction
I believe.
