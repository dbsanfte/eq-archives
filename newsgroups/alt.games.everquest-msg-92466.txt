Thank you to all for your various answers. I appreciate it. I am currently
in Iceclad with the cougars. A little dangerous when I run out of mana. (I
know, I should'nt get to that point ). I have tried to find a group, I am
not adverse to grouping, but so far continue soloing. BTW, I have been in
several groups in my time, I just like to solo also because I can't always
count on finding a group.....
thanks,
 Linda
