The mechanics are kind of weird. If it won't get through the filter, it
just stops dead and kicks back a rejection.  (e.g. if it contains an
obvious one like "fuck" "cunt" or whathaveya.)  Obviously the filter
can't be built to interpret "inappropriate" or "out of game context"
names, or even minorly creative mispellings of foul language. Those get
past the filter.

Next, if there is a guide online (not an apprentice, by the way, but at
least a full guide) the name will flash up on the screen for
consideration. Happens for both new character first names and surnames,
I believe, but I'd have to double check on that. The Guide/GM can now
look at it and either quickly hit the approve or reject, based on the
rules, whimsey, whether they got laid last night, etc. But, if they just
don't notice it, are too busy, are AFK, or what-have-you, OR if there
are none online, then after a set delay the system passes it on as
approved. This is the only reason you can even *get* a name during off
hours when no CS folks are online.  Also could explain your bard
situation. You either got a different guide the second day, or no guide,
or the guide was busy or had downed a few beers by then and mellowed
out.
