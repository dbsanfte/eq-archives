I spend around 1500pp to get to 175 skill.
You cannot earn much from any of the stuff you make before banded, and
the banded can be hard to sell, especially since people want it in
different sizes.
Then I hit 175, and started making FP armor. Had to make a full set for
my troll warrior, so cost me 2Kpp on trying to make 2 full sets, 1 extra
neck, 1 extra BP.
In result i got 1 full set, extra helmet, gauntlets, boots, bracer,
visor.

Then i hit the BIG problem with smithing: Selling the stuff.
Since the ore for FP armor can ONLY be bought, the prices on the armor
do not follow the prices on all other stuff. That means that on the
Veeshan server my FP armor cost between same to 50pp less than Crafted
armor.
That means that NOONE wil buy my stuff, took me 3 weeks to sell the
stuff i had extra of, and thats even in troll size, a size normally not
made, because you have to get to damn Halas to get the molds.
Only positive thing i got from blacksmithing is the ability to make
banded for guild members for free.

If you are human, dwarf or any other race where the cultural armor is
smithed, it might be worth it, but as a wood elf, whose cultural is
tailored, i can only reccomend to stay far away from smithing.
Can reccomend tailoring though, my level 33 druid is my main, untwinked,
and have around 5K in bank, 11K items for sale, for around 40K items on
me, and have twinked my troll with around 20-25K items.
There is a drawback to tradeskills thought, it take TIME. Some of the
easier ones (baking, pottery, fletching) can be learned in a few hours,
and for under 100pp to get to master level. But skills like tailoring or
smithing (especially for FP, since ore are in Steamfont (as blocks of
ore, need to be made to bricks, an extra failure possibility) and High
Hold Keep, and the molds are in Halas, Felwithe and Kaladim) take TIME.
My level 33 druid have a playing time of a little under 33 days now. You
can meet 50+ players with lower playing time.

So if you wanna do tradeskills, be prepared to spend a HUGE amouth of
time on it.
