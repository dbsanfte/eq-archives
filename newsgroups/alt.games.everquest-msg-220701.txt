> So how do you roleplay?

Common problem amoung ~all MMPOG  players<myself included occasionally> is
believing your value system results in a better game.

This is best illustrated by people that enjoy PvP. Their suggestions for how
to make EQ a 'great game' ended with several servers dedicated to PvP. It
took several because everytime a PvP server failed to draw a user base they
were quite vocal about how to fix it. End result was a couple of under
populated servers.

Likewise roleplay was seen as a fix to EQ by a lot of roleplayers and the
Firona Vie server was created to satisfy them. Firona Vie is just ahead of
the last place PvP servers in popularity. Indeed, if all the PvP servers
were consolidated they would probably push FV into last place.

Personally I spend time on a PvP server and recently on FV not so much
because I love PvP or am a 'flaming stick up his butt' roleplayer. It is
more because I dislike the doodism that frequently goes on regular servers.
Actually doodism is pretty rampant on PvP servers too.

That being said, on the FV server almost everyone speaks elvish. The thing
is when intelligent beings that speak a different languages get together,
they most often speak a common language because it is in their best
interests. I mean my dog will learn Spanish if there is a hotdog involved.

Anyway, try FV and be a little flexible. Right out of the gate, think in
terms of a lizard that is going to learn elvish and have aliances with
softskins because "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" and after all, it is
us against the Orcs.
