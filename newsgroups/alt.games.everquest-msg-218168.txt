With a very few exceptions (DN and SG come to mind) they all have that
feel to me. Not that I'm disagreeing with you, I get that same feeling
with LDoN and I'm not sure why. It's not that I'm already burned out
with LDoN, I'm only 8-2 atm and still haven't even seen one of the
themes but it's already at the point where if I have a good tank that
knows how to pull, I know the dungeon will be a win. ... baring bad
pathing on a rescue or a run of bad luck on a collection mission.

The main problem I see with that is that as soon as you add much of
what you describe above, you suddenly need a more 'perfect' group
again. I think they got the balance right in LDoN, in the sense that
as long as you have good players almost any group can succeed. It's
biased a bit too much in favor of DPS but overall they got the balance
a lot closer to perfect than I thought SOE was capable of. Back when
the revamped CT was still a challenge, almost nobody went there w/o a
cleric and few people went w/o a chanter because the mobs are a lot
like you describe.

There are themes out there with more casting mobs or difficult pulls
but people avoid them. Same goes for the hard adventures (although I'd
love to see a level in between normal and hard at the high end). MMC
and Mir are, I think, preferred by most players because they tend to
be the easiest. Most dungeons there are easy to pull because you don't
have the hidden mobs or high caster density of some places like Guk.
Most people go for the path of least resistance. Hell, I'm no
different in some ways, I avoid the collection missions because I hate
the thought of loosing an adventure due to the streakiness of the
random number generator.
