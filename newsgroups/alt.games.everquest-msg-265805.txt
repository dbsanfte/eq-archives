It's from the entertainment industry.

It's supposedly the point at which you can tell that a television series is
past its peak and into its decline, obvious because the producers are doing
lame stunts to try to recover thier falling ratings.   The example being the
episode of "Happy Days" where Fonzie jumped over a shark on his motorcycle.

Since then, it's come to be used to describe anything that was once great,
but is past its peak and in decline.

Six months ago you could hear it quite a bit, but in another six I think
you'll hear this phrase about as often as you currently hear "All your base
are belong to us."
