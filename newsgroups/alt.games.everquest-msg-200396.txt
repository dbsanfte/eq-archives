On paper bards are the most powerful solo class from 27-50 without
question. But that power comes at a price

Bards are a LOT harder to play than any other class. One slip or lapse
in concentration and they get pounded into goo while swarm-kiting. If
bards were as easy to play as you suggest you would see a lot more of
them. 

Most people quit playing thier bards long before they get their first
charm song at 27. I got to 32 before my wrists started to hurt from
all of the clicking and tapping of hot-keys. 

Bards that are PL'd to 27+ tend to get dropped as well, because the
class takes more effort to play well than any other. Bard twinks
generally have no idea how to properly play the class, becuase the
skip past the learning levels.

As mentioned above bards look great on paper, but only the truly
dedicated stick with the class no matter how powerful they can be.
