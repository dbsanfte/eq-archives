Well.. found the "Sneak" trick to still do it for my Vah Shir BST :) No
problems shopping or training with anyone in SH..

Strange to think of it as the Vah Shir BST Trainer says something like "I
dont want anything to do with you Vah Shir.." even tho he is one himself..

Trick is : Stand a bit away from the merchant/trainer/whatever, hit the
"Sneak" button (Make sure you are sneaking.. ie. you are walking slow). Walk
behind the npc's back, and right click as usual..

Dunno if it works with like invis or similar..
