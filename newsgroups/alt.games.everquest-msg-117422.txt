Your statement is true, but then so is fignewton's.  Waking the Sleeper
is pretty stupid content from a player's point of view.  What it
appears to be is a way to get the players to bitch at one another
instead of at Verant for "nerfing the drop tables", remember all the
bitching a few days after Kunark's release when they "adjusted" the
drop tables?

Also, I'm amused by the contrast between your comments to this thread
and your suggestion (in a previous very similar thread) that somebody
cheering for the Sleeper being awakened in violation of an agreement
between guilds go to a dictionary and look up "honor".

Kaev
wishing you continued freedom from that hobgoblin :)
