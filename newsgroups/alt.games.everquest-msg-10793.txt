Yeah,
   What is the big difference.....people in the game buy and sell stuff all the 
time for a profit.Are they doing something illegal??? Trading goes on everyday 
in EQ.........visit the EC tunnel. Some trading/selling of items are rip offs 
some are great. It all boils down to buyer be ware. I would say it is just 
another form of free enterprise at work. VERANT has made it difficult for 
people to acquire pp and certain items in the game (ie. camping for long 
periods of time and mob drop spells). It is ther way of getting people to play 
the game longer, therebye making it more profitable to them.
