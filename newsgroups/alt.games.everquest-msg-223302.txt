Pretty much agree.   Still sucks more to put together a group, but I'm more
than tired of people who say "We're only going to do this one type of
mission and we'll get it if I have to make the group sit at the recruiter
all night!"   It seems like over half of the ones that insist on "no rescue
missions at all!"... have never even tried one.

Theres no doubt that slaughter are the easiest.   Although I have had an
assassinate where it spawned in just the right location that the group
somehow pulled it off, even though we should have lost by all rights.

Some of the dungeons are set up in particularly nasty ways.   Such that they
split immediately after entering, with exactly half the dungeon down each
path.   But for the most part, it's usually one way for quite a while.
Long enough to get the boss up.

More than half the jobs.   It does not seem to be a random distribution.
Slaughter definitely comes up much less than 1/4 of the time.

I've heard it, but not since the first few weeks.   Not since the patch that
announced it fixed.   And I've never had it happen.   Collection is what we
end up doing most often.   As straightforward as slaughter, without the long
wait to get the recruiter to give it up.

Slaughter is always the easiest.   Way too easy, if you ask me.    (They're
bad experience.  All of the same amount of time is spent getting the group
together, and you only get half of the mob killing time out of it.)

Collection, even assuming the best drop rate, you're still going to end up
killing 50 - 60 mobs to get your 20 - 30 drops.    Usually you have to kill
70 or more before you actually do.   So slaugher is easier.

Assassinate... well, by the time you spawn the boss, you've killed you've
killed about 80 or 90% of the mobs needed to win a slaughter... and you
still have to fight to the boss, and kill what might be a very tough mob.

Rescue is the same as assassinate... easier though, since you can track the
hostage even before you've killed enough that he's willing ot be rescued.
But it's still harder than slaughter, since you need to basicly win a
slaughter mission to allow him to leave.   Then have the additional task of
finding and fighting to him.

Because if they didn't, nobody would take any type of mission except
slaughter.    At least now, the people who get sick of the waiting will
finally take a different one.

Not sure what you're asking for, that sentence really doesn't parse to me.

I would have been harsh myself.   If it was up to me, people would get
whatever mission they are assigned.   Each of the camps will only give you
one mission at a time, and if you refuse that misssion, you can accept it at
a later date, but you won't get a new type of mission until you accepted the
original type.   So if you go to Butcherblock, and receieve a rescue..
every time your character goes to Butcherblock asking for one, he gets
nothing but rescue until he attempts it.

I end up doing collection most often as well.   It seems slaughter missions
have a reduced chance of being offered, and collection is the compromise
most often reached with the cowards who don't want any mission that has a
chance of being challenging.  Lots of rescues and assassinates are offered,
a decent amount of collections, and a very few slaughter missions.

We also do assassinate a lot... which is actally the hardest.  (People think
rescue is hardest, but as I said... they usually haven't even tried one.
Rescues are actually easier.)  Assassinate is the one mision type where you
have to worry about group composition a bit more than usual.   If your group
skimped on a tank, and ends up facing a triple 600 hitting warrior boss with
a 54 paladin.. (or a ranger / beastlord) as MT... you might be in trouble.


All of the rescues I have attempted (only 3 or 4, someone always objects)
have been succeses.   In one of them we found the hostage within 10
minutes... and had to take 30 more to clear other wings of the dungeon
waiting for him to be willing to leave.
