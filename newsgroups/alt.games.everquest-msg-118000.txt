When I left Neriak I rejected the Teir'Dal habits of hatred and general
nastiness because I wanted to see the world, and I knew that most of the
world thought the only good dark elf was a dead one.  Well, I've managed to
convince most of the humans to tolerate me in general, and even do business
with me on the quiet.  And I've seen some of the world, ranging from
Nektulos and Freeport Commons over to the Karanas and the Qeynos Hills.

Of course, this is not a large portion of the place, and there are other
places I've always fancied visiting.  Having heard tales of the snowy wastes
of Everfrost and the town of the Barbarians, I thought about wandering up
that way.  But, being a dark elf rogue as I am, I'm still pretty much tarred
with my people's brush as far as the Barbarians are concerned.

So I wondered - does anyone know how I might convince them that I'm on their
side?
