I'm pretty sure you are wrong about the saying.  Money, quite
obviously, can buy happiness.  I think you mean the saying that it
can't buy love.  Which isn't true either.  Go to you local pound, put
down $25, and you have a better than even chance of buying the only
unconditional love that is for sale.
