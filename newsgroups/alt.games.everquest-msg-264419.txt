I don't think social aggro meshes well with linked groups like EQ2
has, because they're so spread out and they all move around
differently, so you can't just wait until they've all moved away from
their friends.  Of course you could design encounters that way, so two
distinct groups will sometimes mingle and sometimes be separate, so
maybe that would work.
