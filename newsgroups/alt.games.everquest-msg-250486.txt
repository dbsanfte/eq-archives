Yeah, but its not really the same. Its more that eventually they
admitted that windowing doesn't let people "cheat." They could already
cheat anyway, with the biggest cheat method being ShowEQ. That was the
only reason they were against windowing for so long, the old goofy
"you can cheat if windowed!" thing.

They were suspending people who admitted they were using EQwindows,
but then they figured out this was ridiculous since they were all just
using it for convenience. Finally, when they could do the windowing
themselves, they said "oh since the game does this now EQwindows is
suddenly ok!.. sure!!"

"What SOE SHOULD do is work on ways to stop such sales from taking
place in the first place."

That is impossible. Its not illegal so nothing can really be done
about it when it happens on a third party site who owns all of their
web servers and everything, which makes a lot of money and buys every
smaller site (IGE owns them all now, even the ones not named IGE such
as mysupersales and player auctions.)

The volume is such that SOE could employ 10 full time people, to do
"sting" operations which legitimately checked on accounts trying to
sell things, but most would be go-between bulk selling accounts and
banning them would hardly put a dent in all the sales. Meanwhile, even
at like 7 bucks an hour you'd be talking about 14,000 a year each so
SOE would be spending upwards of $140,000 a year so that they could
barely make a dent in some third party sales. Its very likely that the
sales they stopped would be worth far less than 140,000 to IGE, so its
a losing scenario. Plus, you'd have a lot of trouble trying to push it
at a budget meeting. You'd get laughed out of the meeting since
everyone could see that it isn't going to do much, while any FALSE
positives would REALLY piss customers off.

So I think SOE SHOULD allow sales, as a go-between. They'd not make
anything off of them themselves, so it isn't really shadey. They'd be
legitimate for the first time, meaning that two players could safely
enter into a transaction which was regulated by SOE and apparently
would just add that additional amount to your subscription cost that
month. There would be no chance of fraud, or upset customers. 
If someone complained that their kid did it without their knowledge,
SOE could take care of that fast and then say "Okay, since your kid
might do this again we are blocking your account from buying or
selling items in this manner.."

"er.. no never mind I'll just watch the kid closer.. er thanks...
yeah.."

Its not going to really ruin the game to allow this, its already
happening anyway and doesn't ruin the game now. I've heard people up
in arms about this saying how bad it is, but they evidently have some
powers to see things that I don't because if I really think about it I
can't actually SEE anything bad that it is doing to the game in the
first place. 

I also don't think they are talking about selling plat, just items.
Yet if they did this with items, I don't think people would be buying
or selling plat anymore since there would not be a point. Sites under
the IGE umbrella usually don't have that many items per server, since
its not as easy to sell them as it is plat in bulk. WIth a secure soe
method, that would change. Items would be rapid to sell for a few
bucks.

It would have been better if they gave more info on how this would be
done. For instance, if it was ONLY subscription fee credit, people
would probably be a lot more likely to click yes. Like if I sell you a
lodizal shield for 20 bucks, then I have 20 bucks of subscription
credit so next month my bill for EQ is $0 and the month after that it
is $5.90.
