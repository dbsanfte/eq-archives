How long do you think I have raided to get basically equivalent gear?  If 
I were to only raid once in a while, I would have significantly poorer 
gear.  If you do lots of single group content, you can attain better gear 
generally, than if you just play sporadically.  I honestly don't see 
anythign wrong with that.

Groups I am in wipe too, it's part of the game.

That means that you can play there, the perception of snobbish folks is 
not an SoE issue to solve really.

Guess what?  That happens to people who don't raid end game areas too.
There are those who want to maximize xp over time, and for them, that 
does mean getting the best equipped folks to group with.  I don't happen 
to fall in that category either.

LDoN obsoleted a lot of raid proggression content too.

I am in a guild with people who like to group together, so, I can 
generally find a group to play with.  Sometimes I do the pickup group 
thing, which has included hitting RSS at times.

No equipment is good enough if the player(s) are complete idiots.  Gear 
will only compensate for so much.  Gear can let a bad player hit easy 
areas that he otherwise could not, it will not let him play effectively 
in a place like RSS, unless he has good groupmates to compensate for his 
idiocy.

Personally, I prefer to be rewarded for my efforts.  You do need to do 
some gear progression in order to be effective in RSS.  If you have a 
warrior trying to tank there with 4k hp and 1k AC, and a cleric with a 
low mana pool and little mana regen, then you should expect to wipe.  If 
you work on attaining better gear over time, from all 1 groupable content 
(actually partial group even), then you can get gear that will allow a 
reasonable player to hit any single groupable zone that is not locked out 
by flag or key access.  To me, that seems like the way it should be.
