Most of us could write a better guide than those "get rich quick" eq
guides on the web. 99.9 percent of their info is already nerfed. 

The kunark or luclin prima guide is nice, especially Luclin, but as
other people said its either info on the web or info you don't need.
It does stupid waste of pages things like listing all the leather,
chain and steel armor and weapons and their stats. That is crap, you
either don't buy such things cause they suck or you go and look at the
vendor and see the stats then. Spell locations on vendors you can find
in 10 seconds with eq.castersrealm.com

No one has ever made what I'd call a "good" EQ book which gives you
very useful info and hints about good quests/faction stuff all in one
place. You could essentially make one using allakhazams as a template
with info from castersrealm and your own experience. You don't have to
list all the items or quests just key good ones or faction raising
ones.

Knowing too much of this stuff makes the game kind of boring though.
After three years and using these sites a lot a lot of us just know
too damn much. I can start any class or race character in EQ and know
exactly what its problems will be, what I can do to fix them and what
not to do. It kind of makes it like a book you've already read. I
think with the next mmorpg I'm in I'll mostly ignore web "spoiler"
info and just have fun and play it like a game where I don't go and
look at info on it while not playing.

I remember being a wide eyed ogre in beta phase 3 and running around
exploring the entire old world with no guide, knowing I was evil and
could be killed at every corner by either creature or guard. I did
this with and ogre shaman buddy of mine and we just had a blast even
though banded armor was not even in yet and the best gear we could get
was storebought EXPENSIVE chain. It was about the most fun that EQ
ever got even though now I'm a 56 druid with an epic and nearly full
tov armor.
