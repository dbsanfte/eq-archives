 I'm at level 51 right now with my hghest level char and frankly
I don't see why you'd want to powerlevel a character unless you
are stuck in a hell level. As I went up in levels I liked EQ less
and less and have been starting new chars just for the novelty 
of playing in "easy" zones and getting reletively large gains in
XP for each kill (it gets reeeaaalll slow as you go up in levels)
AND at lower levels you don't lose a LOT of XP when you die as 
you do at high levels.
 
 So I would say to you.... ENJOY your lower level character! Sure
you can do more damage with high level characters, some of the 
spells are nifty but these places you have to hunt are really, 
really nasty.
 
 Enjoy you lower levels!
