Picture this: Guild spends ages planning to take down ubermob_01. They
put out word to try to get some help on this. Finally, they're there,
getting ready. A 6 level 60 wizards walk in 1/3 of the way into the
fight. All the wizards turn and face ubermob_01. Load torpedoes. Fire.
Mob drops (Okay, maybe not UBER uber mob, but still raid-level), the
wizards get the kill with little to zero effort.

I'm not sure how many high-end raid level mobs 6 level 60 manaburns
could blast away from full, but I'm sure there are a good number that
can be blasted down from just over 50%... Manaburn offers an easy
means to take killstealing to a whole new level.

Have I ever SEEN this happen? No... Not even 100% sure that it's a
realistic scenerio. But, I imagine a larger "deathsquad" of
manaburners could wreak some havoc on raid-mobs...
