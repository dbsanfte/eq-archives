Well  does anybody have any info about the rogue drops?
I've been unable to play since 10/30, due to a fire.  I hope
to be up and running again soon (downloading all the patches
on a 56K modem...yeeesh), and have no clue about any of
the new goodies.  I'm currently camped out at the L. Guk
zone with one rogue and the Plane of Hate with the other
one.

Any tips would be appreciated.
