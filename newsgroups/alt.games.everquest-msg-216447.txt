ROTFLMFAO.  I have been in this forum for over three years.  Sure, I change
my name ever so often.  Humm, maybe it is hard for you to realize that noone
may be who they seem to be on the Internet.  By the way, I was on this group
way back when the Sleeper was first awoken.  Found out about it right here
on this newsgroup.  As I recall that was back in the Spring of 2001.  Hell,
I also remember when one of the hottest topics discussed here was how to
make PP.  I remember when former players would give very detailed posts on
using baking to make decent PP.  This was a year before Luclin even came
out.  Before the Luclin ports, before the "do not have to look at freaking
spellbook while medding".

It is past your bedtime Spanky.
