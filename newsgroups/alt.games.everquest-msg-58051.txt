lol why the hell was the cleric casting celestial heal on a warrior?  You
can't complain about the classes just cuz somebody doesn't know how to fully
utilise their characters skills or play their class.

Also, if you had been a ranger with the cleric (could fear kite) i bet the
cleric wouldn't even use 1/10th of the mana all those celestial heals burnt
up.
Heck.. had the cleric used cheal in the first place fear kiting wouldn't
have even been needed to preserve mana.
