Yes, it's terrible for me to be able to look at a map onscreen. It was much 
more immersive when I was calculating /locs, spitting and cursing at SH on 
new toons, and flipping through the binder of printed-out eqatlas maps.

Admittedly, I do go pac-man style on my bazaar mule. The mule is easier to 
maneuver in the Bazaar with the top-down view and using just the arrow on 
the map to move around. It makes it much easier to triangulate where a 
trader is by rightclicking on their name, too.

Well, agreed, but many many old quests are still like this and always were.

POP introduced the best tradeskill items ever. In fact, two of my 
characters favorite items are tradeskilled- a Ceramic Shield of Justice and 
my Soulstone of Gukta.

Yes, this is true. Likewise, I no longer spend half an hour on a boat, 
unable to even work casting skills(because, you know, the motion of the 
ocean is much more distracting than getting beat on by hordes of undead).

That's a load of shit.
