Sometimes you just die :-P

First off - level is at least as important as resists, if
not more, for determining if you resist an AE.  

Second - even with decent resists/HP for your level, you're
going to get hit by the AE.

How were heals for non-MA melee to be handled?  Depending on
the mob we either have a healer in their groups just for that,
or they call for them.

If you were supposed to call for a heal, then it's your bad
for not doing so.  If your group's healer was supposed to be
monitoring you, you might have just gotten OOR of them, or they
might have just dropped the ball.
