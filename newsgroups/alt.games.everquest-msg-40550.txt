    It usually is, these days. But read again - ask the early clerics how
Chardok was regarded.

    And used to be two of the hardest mobs in the game, in a dungeon that's
just train-happy. It was a given that if you went to help someone with the
King, that nothing would drop for you and that you'd die once. So nobody
wanted to go. Now, with modern armour and weapons, it can be so easy that
the top guild on our server recently did the entire King room AoE-style.
They have a great picture of about seven or eight sorcerors of Di'Zok and
Royal Guards all going down at once. ;-)

    It is a strong item for a raid, but "best item" might not be such a good
title. I can think of at least one cleric weapon that would make me bag the
Sprinkler.

    Yeah, Rage sucks. I have mine ahead of me, and I am NOT looking forward
to it as I hate camping. But since I'm level 60 now (yay, ding!), it's all
camps for me from now on in. Whether you want to call them "raids" or not.

    You could fix the ragefire camp a lot of ways. But splitting it up like
this so the backstory on the epic made no sense doesn't seem like the
correct "roleplaying" way (although it would ease the clog of people VERY
quickly).

    Within one day of patch day, anything worth killing on my server is
dead - and we don't have the real power guilds that some servers have. So
some mobs stay up because nobody can kill them yet. Trust me, they're right
on the money when it comes to raid mobs.

    I have to plead ignorance here. Derakor the Vindicator is on a four hour
timer? I was under the impression it was longer. Is he only killed so folks
can get at the long-timer Statue of Rallos Zek, then?

    Note how this is the same as Ragefire, which you claimed "sucked". The
only difference being people are so desperate to kill Ragefire that they
attempt to "camp" him. If you read some of the uberguild message boards,
you'll see that one of the biggest challenges facing them today is that the
endgame is now the bottleneck for the players - too many guilds can kill,
and want to kill, the same week-long timer spawns that drop the best gear in
the game. What can you do about that, assuming VI will NOT budge on the
number of high-level drops they want coming into the world per unit time?

    People camp Hadden, and he's what, a six hour spawn with a one in six
chance of dropping a Fishbone Earring? Back when that was the only source of
a permantent Enduring Breath item, he was not only camped, he was
"killstealed" constantly. Only by the player definition, though - usually
the first WIZ to cast a spell on him got him, and that isn't KSing by the
PnP. Making more spawns on regular timers that can, and will, make people
invoke PnP is the LAST thing the game needs.
