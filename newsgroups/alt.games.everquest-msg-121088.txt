Its broken as intended.  Pet only casts if you have a target selected,
attacks that target, and when the target dies, it returns to your side,
loiters a few seconds, then kills itself.  -If- you have something
attacking you when the original target dies (or before pet kills
itself) it will instead attack the new target.  While doing my cleric epic
drop in Sol A I developed this into an art, and once successfully
killed every last goblin in the zone with a single cast of the UHOF.
Deaf as a post and suicidal, 100hp to its name unbuffed (and you'd
have to be a madman to buff it up... which I am) but its just hard
to resist.

Course now I have an item that lets me summon it for 450 mana instead
of 600... look out Norrath the Hammer is back and its cheaper than ever!

Cleric Jack of All Trades, master of one.

But if, just -if- they had removed the suicidal nature of the pet you'd
never
laugh at that hammer again... cleric buffed up its a half decent pet
actually.
