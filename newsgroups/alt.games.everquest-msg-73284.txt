    I ressed two tanks a few nights ago in Velk's. They hadn't got groups
yet, and had died when looking. They both were bound in City of Mist. As
payment I forced the Paladin to repeat after me:

I Paladinsname
promise to
without delay
change my bind point.

    Got a nice ROFL when we got to the fourth line. Bet he was wondering
what he'd gotten himself into when he clicked "yes" on that res.
