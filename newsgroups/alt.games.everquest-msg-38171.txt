Rhazar is not a PH for hasten, and is not 60+.  He cons yellow to a 53.
Though Rhazar is a cleric, he wanders around the drake temple.

The known PHs for hasten are:
 - Hasten himself (duh)
 - a drake
 - some unkempt (smelly?) ranger
 - and brother Z.

Hasten is blue to a 53 (I think hes around 45 or so)
A drake is green
the ranger is green
Brother Z is 61 or 62, as he cons yellow to a 60.

As for starting the quest with hasten, ask him why he runs so fast.  He will
talk about Jboots and tells you that you need:

 - An ancient ring
 - A shadowed rapier
 - 3500 Gold pieces

The ancient ring drops off an ancient cyclops..he spawns in South Ro, Ocean
of tears and has been rumored to spawn in the karanas somewhere (thought I
have only seen him in the first two places).

The ring has +5 INT to it, and can be worn as a bracer.

A shadowed rapier drops off of shadowed men. There are many zones with
shadowed men, like: West Commons, Lesser faydark, Lava storm, innithule
swamp.  The rapier is NORENT, so do this part last.

The 3500 gold comes from your bank vault.
