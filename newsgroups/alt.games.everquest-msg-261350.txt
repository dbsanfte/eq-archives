Ok I found trhe answer (thanks to shaman's crucible). It is a new NPC
that I saw earlier this week while doing one of the new tasks. When I
saw the NPC the first time I hailed it because it had a name
associated with the Shaman Epic. However at that time it didnt respond
it just looked at me, so I carried on with what I was doing. Today
when i hailed  it, it immediately spoke to me and gave me the linking
quest.
