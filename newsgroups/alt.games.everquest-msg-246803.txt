It's not a shaman nerf, it's a nerf to the entire game. The mudflation
has progressed so far the distinctions between the classes in some
important respects has vanished. Without that distinction balance
becomes impossible and only the best are wanted in groups or raids.

Though I think EQ spun its wheels with Luclin and went deeper and
deeper into the toilet with every expansion afterwards, none of them
were as hopelessly bad as GoD (LDoN comes close) and there seems to be
little hope on the horizon of things getting better with *all* the
announced features of OoW just making what you described *worse*.

See you in WoW Bob. Or in csipg.*.
