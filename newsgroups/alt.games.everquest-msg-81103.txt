Neither.  The four numbers are:

1. Round trip time, in milliseconds, from your computer to the server
and back.

2 and 3. (I never can remember the order of these two).  Packet loss.
One of them is packet loss from the server to your computer, and the
other is packet loss from your computer to the server.

4. Data rate, in bytes/second.  This is how much data/second the
server is trying to send to your computer.
