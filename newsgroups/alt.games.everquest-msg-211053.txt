My level 56 ranger was my first and is my favorite.  
You don't realize how much you love track until you are playing something that
doesn't have it.  Especially when you enter a new land.  You know right away
what level the mobs are that are near you, and can go right to them, (or know
that you need to find a new place to play :)  
I play with a wizard and I *am* the tank.  If you play in small groups find
gear with good AC and hitpoints.  Snare the mobs so they don't get away from
you.  Use snare / fear so you can pound on the mob while he's trying to walk
away.  
In a group you shouldn't be taking the hits anyway. Use all your buffs on you
and your teammates, and damage shield all the melee classes.  Sow the casters,
and cast your shield  on them.   If no one else lives our cleric and enchanter
are for sure going to get away :)
If you are getting agro use a slower weapon and quit hitting the damn taunt
button.  Damage shield the main tank and not yourself.  Quit attacking all
together and step back if you have to, and don't use a procing weapon. 
Otherwise your cleric is going to slap you silly, (or want to).
If you *are* the only tank hit taunt like crazy, every time you can.  If you
can't keep the mobs off the casters your group will die.
Can't locate your teammates?  Get turned around pulling that rockhopper?  Use
your track key.   See an add coming out of nowhere and there's no chanter? 
Root that sucker down.  Then snare him for good measure.  
Can't afford arrows?  Pull with flame lick or snare.
Is your cleric having a hard time keeping up with healing?  You've got a heal! 
It may suck, but in a pinch it's better than nothing.  And keep your bind wound
skill up for emergencies.  Don't forget your cure poison spell.  It may come in
handy.  Rangers are self sufficient.  
Need to cross the dreadlands?  Camouflage &  levitate everyone and fly.  
Nasty evil orcs too close together?  Use harmony, then pull them one at a time.
 
If you are doing all this and you are still bored and think rangers suck you
probably need to find an easier class to play :)
