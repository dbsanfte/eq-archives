Not every conclusion that is supported by utilitarian analysis is 'bad'. 
Often utilitarianism coincides with instead of contradicting with the 
various other recgonized principles. Your parking lot scenario is fairly 
bland, and thus the weight of most moral principles is quite weak... 
e.g. you can't invoke the sanctity of life for either case.

But offhand I can't think of any moral principle that would 
categorically uphold stopping traffic with the right of way, to let 
someone out a parking lot. Most are ambivalent, or lean against it.

But I find when utilitarian arguments *do* oppose the others, I would 
usually prefer to side myself with the others.

Yeah. Its an ugly scene either way, it wouldn't be good dilemma were it 
not. But the utilitarian side strikes me as the greater evil.
