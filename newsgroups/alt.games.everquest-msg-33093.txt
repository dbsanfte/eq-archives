Last night while running through the Karana's I saw two player corpses, one
in NK the other in SK. The spooky part is that instead of being in the
normal laying down fetal position, they were standing with legs and arms
spread wide. Looked like they had been crucified. This was on Vazaelle.

Kind of like that.

Anybody else notice this?
