Over priced, yes. Stupid, hardly.

It's nice to be able to add a little wisdom to a shaman piece that is
outstanding in everyway, except in a lack of wisdom. Not that I
actually have the money to buy these things, or any piece of equipment
that I'll be keeping long enough (at this point) to warrent auging it
with something so expensive, but the idea is really nice. =)
