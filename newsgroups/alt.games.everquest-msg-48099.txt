Hail, all!

While helping friends in The Hole, we came across 'Dirt of Brell' or 'Holy
Dirt off Brell' (rats, can't remember now...).

Being a servant of Brell myself, I was allowed to loot it.

All I need now is to know what this no drop, unstackable item is used for )

Any ideas?

Safe journeys to you,


Stumped Cleric
