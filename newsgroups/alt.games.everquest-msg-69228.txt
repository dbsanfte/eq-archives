I gave a 6/44 HtH weapon to a 52 monk friend to test this out.  The
weapon overwrites both your native damage and speed, he hit like he
had a 6/44 1hb in his hands.

What this means is that lowbie monks and beastlords can be twinked
up with high end hand to hand weapons if we can find any... best weapon
I've found so far are my quest claws, at 7/28.  A guildmate mentioned
finding a 9/29 somewhere out in one of the higher level zones... but
what I'd love to find would be a 1/20 or something, damage unimportant
just faster, since HtH seems to train up relatively slowly... my Piercing
is at 60 while my HtH is at 30!
