Kind of sobering to think that 18 years ago or so, I installed a 33MB hard 
drive and two 10 MB hard drives on my Amiga 1000, and that was more space 
than I could imagine filling up at the time.  Now, I'm running with 120GB 
of hard disk space, and I get worried if I am down to only a few GB of 
space.
