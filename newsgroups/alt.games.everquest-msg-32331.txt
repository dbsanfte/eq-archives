That is true. However I have been ebolt'ed several times (out of many,
many attempts) with 130+ pr. And ebolt is a nasty spell on a caster in a
PvP situation.

Rogue's are pretty much a mystery. All I know is that while there is a
rogue around, I will get interupted a lot, and if I get backstabbed I'm
almost dead :p

Not many rogues use poison in PvP as far as I've seen, although I tend
to avoid them.

Aye. Most people think rogues are just people who backstab a mob, then
needs chain-heals to stay alive :p

That is correct, however spells only do 66% damage in PvP. So Ice Comet
does something like a little over 700 (been a long time since I've
tested it, I run with 150+cr so it never max's its damage on me). Rogue
backstab's *arent* nerfed in PvP, like all melee damage.

I saw a screenshot of Reefman (60 rogue RZ, won server BotB and I think
came second at the finals) kill a warrior in 3 backstabs.

Very much so! It is very hard to avoid rogues in anything other than 1v1
confrontations though. And even then, I've gotta be strafing around and
shadowstepping a lot, meaning most of the fight is spent not casting.

Not much I can do about my connection, I'm on cable from australia, and
the real holding back factor is the link to the US. They recently made a
new one, which my ISP got part of the bandwidth, and my ping times went
down to 220 with 0% packetloss, but then it started going to shit so
they've re-routed everyone through the old link giving me around 360-450
ping with low packetloss (0-10%).

This is also part of the reason why I don't have much fun playing
melee's, as it is *very* hard to PvP a melee without a decent
connection.

Rogues don't scare me when I'm prepared. However if I get double
backstabbed out of nowhere, and lured by his friend, I'm dead. (keep in
mind the AC of a necro wearing resist gear is laughable..).

I hate using specific buffs, esp. mid-fight, as they tend to fill my dot
slots...which can be a pain if a wandering druid decides I want to be
Winged Death'd.

Keep in mind that I have 1100hp + 550 (manaskin), and the rogue has 2k+
or so (I think, anyway). Damage shields are used in PvP a bit by druids
though, their high level damage shields + regen + heal's combine to make
them formidable to a melee (if the druid has prep time for the fight).

In a fight in an open area against a rogue, I'd have to say I'd cast
ignite blood, then splurt (both unresistable, but pumice-able). By that
time the rogue has decided whether he is staying to fight, or is running
(most people choose to run). I can usually get a quick deflux in at that
point. I wouldn't fight a rogue that is ready for me though, the only
time I can reliably cast on a rogue/monk/ranger is when I get the jump.

If he stays to fight then I just strafe around to avoid melee while the
pet beats on him and dot's do damage. I usually use sow potions for the
speed advantage (*everyone* on RZ has jboots 50+, not sure if its the
same on blue servers), which helps to avoid the melee person, or chase
them down to deflux again. If he manages to pumice my dot's my
likelihood of winning is a lot less.

Also keepin mind, a lot of PvP battles come to me, so a lot of the time
I don't have a pet up (simply don't feel like medding for a few minutes
every time I zone).

No point trying to channel through rogues, monks and rangers imo. At
high levels they seem to do *ridiculous* amounts of hits per second, and
I never seem to be able to cast through them. I almost died to a ranger
in KC because I just wanted to get just 1 deflux off...I kept being able
to cast 2.9999 seconds of the spell then he'd come and belt me several
hundred times just before deflux gets to 3.0 seconds and casts :p

I actually have no idea about that. I never use /pet guard here, except
for exp'ing.

Pets are good range finders though. If you were in my zone I would type
"/pet attack James", and if you were in the level range (+/-4 levels on
RZ) then it will say nothing, but whenever you got inside its agro
radius it will attack you, unless I give it other commands before that.
If you are not within the PvP range then the pet will say you aren't a
legal target.

I use that to sort through potential attackers when I am exp'ing (as
doing /who every 5 seconds is second nature to me).

Anyway, rogues are very lethal 55+. PvP is a bit like "scissors paper
rock" though, there is no way to win *all* fights. I just tend to avoid
rogues because the potential for extremely high PvP damage is there.
With 0.0 cast-time and being almost "unresistable" (c'mon, I'm a caster
:p).
