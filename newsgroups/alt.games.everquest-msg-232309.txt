There have been lots of changes to the character INI files over time.
Perhaps there's something incompatible left over in the INI files for
those characters.  I'd suggest saving the INI files with for those
characters to a floppy and then delete the files from the game
directory and try logging them on. 

If those characters log on fine with a "blank" INI, then it is an INI
file issue.  You can then compare the old INI with the new INI created
when you logged in to restore your friends list, hot keys, etc.
