Hey,

Just trying to spread the word about a new gaming news site I've 
launched. It allows users to post news and articles, and it includes 
general gaming news. News regarding: EverQuest, Anarchy Online, DAoC, 
Diablo, Shadowbane, Playstation, Dreamcast, Xbox, etc... are all 
accepted and posted. :)

The address is http://hrdot.tk/ if that is having troubles try 
http://box.hackersrealm.net/ but please don't be confused by the second 
URL. hrdot is NOT a hacking site of any kind.

Check it out, let me know what you think. If you'd like to help e-mail 
me at tuxracer AT iclinux DOT com (spambot proof, I'm sure you can 
figure it out ;) )

Thanks,
Tux Racer

(Sorry if this seems like senseless spam, I really am trying to only 
reach out to communities who would be interested in it. Not trying to 
bother anyone :/ Seeing in other newsgroups is because it is much easier 
to copy-paste then to retype all of this lol Hopefully this isn't too 
much of an annoyance.)
