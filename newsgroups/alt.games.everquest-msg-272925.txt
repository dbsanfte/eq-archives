I always felt a little guilty for multiboxing in EQ.
Playing with myself in a multiplayer game, like masturbating in a brothel. 
=)

But it's extremely fun and challenging, you can always choose to push the 
limits a little bit further as the multibox group and your skills develop, 
hopefully without hurting anyone else and only risking a little time to 
summon your own corpses. And it's non-stop action, there's always something 
to do, switching between windows and computers like crazy =)

If I one day can't resist returning to that diabolic game, the first thing 
on my todo-list is (after getting lvl 70 on all chars) to go and solo Vindi 
and the Velious dragons, I am sure it can be done with a good (far from 
uber-equipped) group these days.
