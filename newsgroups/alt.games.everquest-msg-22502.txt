  One thing that I do is to go do something besides camping and killing. =

  Once, just for laughs, my Magician wandered Nektulos handing summoned
  weapons to all the decaying skeletons, and tying dimensional pockets =
full
  of Beetle Eye Pies to the wolves.  Granted, giving the skeletons =
Swords of
  Runes was probably a bad idea, but it definitely made things =
interesting
  for everyone in the area.

  If I've gotten some interesting but not particularly valuable item, =
like a
  Chipped Vellium Amulet, I'll create a mini-newbie quest.  I recently =
went
  to GFay looking for the ground spawn item used to make green dye.  =
Since my
  Magician is a Dark Elf, I'm not terribly keen on wandering through the
  forest staring at the ground and waiting for Guard Pinehead to drop =
out of
  a tree on me.  So I went to the bandit camp north of Felewithe, and
  announced that I was buying the items I wanted.  I also mentioned that
  whoever brought me the most during the two hours I was there would win =
the
  amulet.  I then proceeded to make life miserable for the bandits, =
since I
  also need the Elf Blood they rarely drop.  I was actually somewhat =
suprised
  to have no less than six low level characters show up selling the dye
  components.  (It is Greater Twinkdark, after all.)  I ended up with =
two
  stacks of raw green dye parts, and a happy level 6 Rogue got a nice =
amulet.

  However, I do get burned out on EQ.  I get burned out on most games
  eventually.  The distinguishing feature of EQ is that I keep coming =
back.=20
  I thought I'd quit for good last time, and only just refrained from =
quietly
  deleting my characters.  But I left them, and then they did the big
  tradeskill patch, and fixed a few of the broken spells, and added a =
lot of
  new quests.  Some of what they'll add in Luclin looks interesting (new
  spells for every class,) some of it I can't use and therefore don't =
care
  about (my system probably won't handle the Luclin zones,) and some of =
it is
  downright scary.  (Is it just me, or are all the new character models
  *fat?*  I mean, the current ones are both blocky and super-slim in =
their
  spandex plate armor, but the new human model just does not look heroic =
to
  me.  In fact, he looks like the security guard from Half-Life:  =
Opposing
  Force, except in plate mail.  And with less hair.  And a bigger beer
  belly.)

  On the other hand, I've never really understood the "EQ as a way of =
life"
  method of playing.  The only item I've ever tried to camp in the game =
is
  the AC ring for Jboots, and that was for my (currently) level 44 =
Magician.=20
  I've still never gotten the ring.  If I'm hunting somewhere and =
someone
  starts to be a pest, I just leave.  If I want to be somewhere else, I =
just
  go, I don't sit around asking for a SoW, or a Port.  As a SoW'less =
Magician
  whose Invisibility can last anywhere from 1 second to around 10 =
minutes,
  just getting somewhere alive is usually quite an adventure.  When I =
start
  to get upset about something, it's time to sleep for the night.  (I =
don't
  think I've ever played more than seven hours at once, and I've only =
done
  that three times.)  When it starts to feel like a chore to sign in and =
play
  the game, it's time to go play something else, or do something else.

  In any case, EQ is a game.  Games are meant to entertain.  If you are
  having fun, great.  If not, it's probably time to consider doing =
something
  else.  Get a hobby.  Get a girlfriend.  Learn to juggle.  (Which is a
  useful skill to have if you want to have a hobby and a girlfriend at =
the
  same time.)  Learn to speak Japanese, so you can communicate when they =
take
  over the world.  Stare at a crystal and become One with Nature.  Buy =
Dan
  Reeder's book "The Simple Screamer" and make an ugly little monster =
statue
  out of newpapers and glue.  Play a Final Fantasy game, and see if you =
think
  all those people who rave about it are really nuts.  Play with a =
Rubik's
  Revenge cube, and drive yourself nuts.  Take up singing, and drive =
everyone
  else nuts.  Go watch a sunset, or pet a kitten, or smell a rose.  =
(Don't
  pet a sunset, watch a rose, or smell a kitten, people will think =
you're
  weird.)  Go to the park, sneak up behind a mime, and silently mock him =
as
  he silently annoys everyone else.  In short, if EQ is boring, go do
  something that isn't.
