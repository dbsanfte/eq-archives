Collects have gone swimmingly lately for me, including a pretty easy success
last night despite a wipe when someone apparently made pull of 3 into a pull
of six by popping a bitten victim into 3 scavengers with an AoE rain.
Collects are my mission of choice, although I do them all in Mistmoore.  I
can't speak for the other themes.  Despite what I've read, the number
required has not made a difference - those in the low 20's have been just as
easy as ones in the high 20's.
