I logged on this morning about 3:00am I happen to be killing Panthers in WL
for skins. I am on the eastern zone wall about as far south as you can
safely be without the Giants coming over and bashing your heads in everytime
you move. I have this 55 druid camping Sentient Suit of Armor a good
distance away bitching that I have cut his kiting zone in half, he is being
very belligerent about this I told him I would be happy to move well north
of him but I can guarantee that he wont get trained by panthers as the spawn
in the southern section and I would have to pull through his camp. He tells
me not to pull anything through his camp or things will get nasty. Twice he
kites through our camp we politely ask him to kite to the north being there
is nobody north of him, on the third time he brings one down we killed it
got the credit for the kill and looted it picked up a set of Greaves, he
starts demanding the greaves. He then brings 2 more down training us I warn
him not to train us or I will show him what being an asshole is he proceeds
to train us again our shaman gets killed. I then proceed to get sowed run
through the zone getting as many panthers, Sentients I can find run up to
him and FD needles to say he didn't survive to ordeal.
