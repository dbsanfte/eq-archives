What others have said, plus Fear at this level is valuable as well when it
comes to adds and such(I believe at your level, the only other class to have
that spell is Enchanter. Clerics have one vs. Undead, Druids have one vs.
animals, but yours works across the board)

Low on tanks? Your pet at this level works just as well, with the exception
that they take more discipline to control in dungeons and tend to pull
trains if you're not careful. Hotkey your pet commands if you haven't
already.

Keep in mind that grouping is fun and you need to do it whenever you can
just to keep from growing bored. But, being that Necromancer is the ultimate
solo class in EQ, that is where your true strength will lie from 1-65.
