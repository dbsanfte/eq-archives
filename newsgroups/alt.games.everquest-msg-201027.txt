Personally I wouldn't go so far as to call anybody a 'Dick' for asking
for donations for casting a spell attainable as low as level 9,
personally I SoW people when asked, so long as they are present and it
requires no more of me than to target them and click my SoW button.

I don't charge for my buffs (as a beastlord) I always cast SL/SR when
in a group (even just a buff group for KEI) and usually target the
nearest player when casting it for my own benefit.

I really HATE the way people use their abilities to make others pay in
what is after all just a game. It truly costs you nothing to cast a
spell, unless you are in a combat situation.

But thats just my take on it, others think they are sharp or somehow
cleverer than anybody else simply because everything they do is a
business transaction, even in a game .

It beats me, but there ya go.

Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana.

Frostfist (41) Beastlord on Stromm.

Otserp (32) Mage on Venril Sathir.

Wikkan (42) Druid on Karana, Nekk (32) Necromancer, Moorbane (26) Warrior, Zinga (32) Bard, etc....
