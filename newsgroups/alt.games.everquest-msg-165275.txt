I think of coordinates as "North West". The first number shows you how much
north you are (south for negative), the second number how much west you are
(east for negative), the third number is your 'height' Z-coordinate, it is
usually not important.

It's takes a little time to get used to the flipped axis, but well worth it
once you master running the shortest distance between two given locs.
