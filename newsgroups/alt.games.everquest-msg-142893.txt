Sorry to disagree here but the basis for a market price is what the most
motivated BUYER is willing to pay for an item. In an auction situation the
final price is determined by  the aggregate "value" of the item for sale.
That is determined by the available pool of bidders
.
 For example, a study I recall reading about

Quite possible,,,

Why?  Because the

Or the underestimated the costs of producing the field, or oil prices
flucuated as they often do. Also you are insterting an assumption here that
the "winner" has always overbid the value of oil field rights. This is one
small area of the economy and imho an apples and oranges comparison.

No, the winner of the bid is the buyer willing to pay the highest price at
the moment in the bazaar. There is no other overridding reason.....The
object in question sells for what it is 'worth'. That is what another person
will pay you to have the item.

To be germaine to your analogy if I sold $10 of 2002 pennies no they would
not be worth more than $10 or so. But to compare that sale to a selling of
say 100 1889 pennies.. (of which there is a scarcity).. is silly....then it
could be worth much more to a moticated buyer...

No.. again you are confusing issues. Market prices are determined by the
consumer in free markets and for the most part EQ is a free market. Prices
are not determined by the sellers. They base their prices on what the
motivated buyer will pay..

I take exception to this.. Buyers are ALWAYS at an advantage when it comes
to spending decisions.. aside from a very few monopolies on what we deem
critical goods (phone kinda, cable kinda....)
the entire spectrum of human commerce is avaiable to me..

I am not sure how this is a bad thing?

It isn't a bad thing really.. It will speed the rate of gear/plat mudflation
in the game but that could be be a bad thing in some situations.
