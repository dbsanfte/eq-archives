You are right, it isnt COMPLETELY dead, I have done much of what you
described later in buying items that are undervalued (REALLY wish I
was there to buy the KEI that went for 30k!).

I have a friend with 20 stacks of spiderling silk.  LOL, trying to
work out a price with her.  She is lazy and wont ever make them into
padding even thought I talk about how much it is going for right now=)


My biggest question is......Are you even SEEING spiderling silk or
thread for sale?  It never is when I am there=)  There was a nice Red
Dragon Scale being listed at 100k though LOL
