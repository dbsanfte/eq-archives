Actually, as far as I'm concerned the topic of the tangent is whether
or not purchasing plat to buy gear is necessary to play the game.
Would you like me to provide the quote?

Your argument centered on the (i think mistaken) idea that the only
point of everquest is to get into an uberguild and kill the biggest
mob. And that any thing you do to get to that point (including buying
gear) is fine.

I disagree with that, There are many points to everquest, and
accumulating plat and gear is one of them, so is 'frolicking about in
old expansions' as you so cutely put it.

Typically you are expected to get your lost xp back on your own time.
In a guild that raids virtually everyday that's a big committment...
especially if you are a ranger ;)

And they should really use them to bathe, not play more EQ. :)

Yeah I'm exaggerating the demands that the uberguilds have...
however...

Quote from the AL website:

" We raid every day but Saturday, usually starting at 5:30pm PST. If
you can't play from that point until after midnight, then AL isn't for
you. "

Or Quote from TR website:
"Please also note that you should have high play time. About 5+ hours
a day and raiding at least 6 days a week."

Officially, one gives you one day off, and one *might* give you one
day off ;)... and you seriously think a sane person in one of these
guilds should hop into eq to play some more??

A macro tends to be more inherently susceptible to failure, because by
definition it fires a series of a mouse clicks at screen coordinates
and keystrokes at timed intervals, and other emulated end-user
interaction instead of interfacing directly with the software through
APIs and other programming mechanisms. This is inherently less
reliable.

A macro also relies on 'visual cues' like the colour of a pixel at
certain coordinate.

For example many game macros can break if a patch changes the default
colour or location of the health bar... 

Macros interface with programs the way people do, and they simply
can't cope with the mundane stuff that a human copes with
automatically, (well most of them... I could relate endless horror
stories about end users stumped by a button being moved...)
