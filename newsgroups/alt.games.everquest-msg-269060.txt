While this is true, its not the ONLY thing its called.  In particular, 
some forms of dual boxing are often referred to as Botting.  The 
difference is that a true dual box usually has both characters being 
actively played and even grouped together, while the "bot" is usually 
ignored most of the time and rarely grouped.

But that aside, the fact that a thing has one name that is commonly used 
hardly prevents it from also being called a different name; lets take 
for example Vomit, also Barf, Regurgitate, Ralph, Drive the Porceline 
Bus, Technicolor Yawn... need more?  There are lots.  Stating that its 
common to call it barfing would not make any of the other terms incorrect.

While this is technically accurate, it doesn't correspond to how the 
word is usually used in EQ1.  A "bot" in common EQ parlance is a dual 
boxed character which isn't actually being played, but is just being 
used to accomplish certain simple tasks.  A "buffbot" is a "bot" in this 
sense, which is used to buff.  I've also seen "healbots" and "nukebots" 
or  more often "bot cleric" or "bot druid".  Another word for this is 
"pocket" as in "pocket cleric", although that may also refer to a 
character which can be logged in in order to do a job (buff or rez, for 
example)

Since true botting is very rare in EQ1, you don't often see the word 
used to mean that, -in EQ-.  Even though its technically incorrect, the 
alternate use of the term is in fact more common... to the point where 
if someone in EQ1 says they have a bot, its very likely they really mean 
they have a dual boxed character they drag around for occaisional use.
