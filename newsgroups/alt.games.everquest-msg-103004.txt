That 2.5 hour recharge compares rather favorably with the respawn times
for a wide assortment of major mobs.  Based on EQ's history, I'd say
that on many servers the lifespan of quite a few of these mobs will
soon drop from hours to minutes, or even seconds.  And the loot from
these mobs will become the private domain of a tiny handful of
characters.  That will quite like get Verant's attention.  Tho again,
based on EQ history, the nerf will of course be delayed until just about
the time that the mid-tier guilds are ready to get in on the action
themselves.  I'm not implying that this will be deliberately timed, it
just always seems to take them until after the power gamers have already
"got theirs" to fix these balance issues.
