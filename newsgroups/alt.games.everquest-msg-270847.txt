On a couple of occasions in the very recent past I have experienced the
odd situation of ordering my pet to attack a targetted MOB, have the
pet respond with its usual attacking message, BUT it just sits there.
It was very unsettling to spam the attack key (I have it hotkeyed) and
not have the pet do anything except tell me it was attacking (and not
doing so).

I forget all the details of the first incident but after a short time
(and this was much longer than it normally should have taken), the pet
finally went and started attacking the MOB. Possibly by that time I had
been attacked which would normally get the pet attacking anyway.

The second incident was on PoJ in the "Captain's Room". We had a two
pull (or maybe an ADD) and as the rogue was getting beaten down by one.
All I could do was hit my pet attack (I use /pet kill) key, see the
combat spam as the pet said it was attacking the targetted MOB in
response to my command, and watch in horror as the pet just sat (in the
middle of the battle) doing nothing. I may have then gotten hit which
then spurred the pet to attack.

I submitted a /bug report but this would be a devil to track down.
Hopefully, I'll have more presence of mind to make notes about the
action (I don't log stuff).

Anyone run across similar behavior? I am pretty sure that in both
instances, legal targets were targetted, and the response from the pet
did not indicate otherwise.
