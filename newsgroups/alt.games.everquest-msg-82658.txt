Here's my usually setup at 60:

1) theft of thought (steal mana from mob)
2) mesmerization (aoe mez, never leave home without it)
3) swap spot (see below)
4) forlorn deeds (or whatever the highest level slow is called)
5) color slant (aoe stun)
6) color shift (aoe stun)
7) dazzle (single target mez)
8) fetter (highest level root)

Note: I rarely mem gate.  I'm usually the first to die anyway.  And if
I die, the rest of the group usually isn't far behind.


Swap spot will contain:

Glamor of Kintaz (in areas where some mobs are too high to mez with
dazzle)

Botran's Agaracie (high level charm)

Tashanian (in the rare dungeon where I have problems with resists)

Boon of the Garou (if it makes the main tank happy)

Bedlam (ablative damage absorption sheild) If I'm puller

Blanket of forgetfullness (aoe mem blur)

Color slant (another aoe stun) if doing an AOE group

Dementia (nuke, if I have too much mana)



Just got dire charm last night (/cheer me) Haven't had a chance to use
it, but I suspect I'll have a different setup for when I have a
perma-pet.
