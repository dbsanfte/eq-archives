First, '-' is an invalid character for variables, I believe. Next, your
print statements need +'s, they should be:
25310 Print "You have spoiled your own lands " + char-name1 + ",  You shall
not spoil mine!"
25350 PRINT mob-204 + "hits you for " + attack-damage + "1"

I'm guessin that "1" should be "!" too. Finally, dont use LET, its not
needed and obsolete, and makes you look old.

Good luck!
