I call bullshit on your "can't replace item lost or destroyed" statement.

A few weeks ago I lost my Anizok's Minimizing Device.  I lent it to a friend to use during
a guild raid for which I could not attend.  The next day, when she handed it back to me,
something went awry and it poofed.  (No, my friend did not keep it...)

I petitioned with an exact explanation of events, including characters, items, zones and
times.  Two days later the AMD was back in my inventory.  The character was not rolled
back, because AA XP earned in the meantime was unaffected  The ticket was closed with a
statement to the effect of, "we reviewed your information and our logs, and we have
determined that you are entitled to reimbursement of your lost item."

I therefore have first-hand experience which contradicts your  "can't replace item lost or
destroyed" statement.

Best regards,
