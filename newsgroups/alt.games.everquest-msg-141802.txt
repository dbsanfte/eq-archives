Id say only 1/4 to half of all bank pops (outside the bank) are solid blue
to me at 60.

Having spent MANY hours exping in kael I refuse to believe anything other
than luitenants at the bank will drop armour, but thats because of the
absolutely shitty drop-rates, not because its not on their loot tables

lol yeah.  I hear AoW is a good mob to pharm too, if you want more variation
than boots/bp :)
