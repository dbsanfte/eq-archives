Several of my friends of switched to horizons. I like a lot of what I've 
heard, but I'm not impressed with its lack of quests and lack of 
dungeons so I'm giving it some time to mature before looking at it 
seriously.

I hear that a ton about the new crop of games... that really begs the 
question why these people come back to eq. It doesn't make sense to 
complain that FFXI or AC2 or Horizons was novel at first... but then its 
just the same old leveling treadmill... and then come back to eq the 
biggest treadmill of them all, and the one they've been treading for years.

If I'm going to be bored by a game, I'd think I would prefer to be bored 
by a new game. :)
