Well, looking at the whois records for ign.com, ige.com, and 
ogaming.com, I notice that both ign.com and ige.com list their contact 
information, but ogaming.com uses a proxy service to keep anonymous.

The name servers for ogaming.com are at thottbot.net, so I'd guess they 
have something in common, such as who owns them.  Anyone know who owns 
Thottbot?
