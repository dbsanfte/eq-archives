Not always, and it's frustrating when you don't and you lose all the
experience you just
spent the last hour gaining (or more).  Sometimes it leaves a bad taste in
my mouth for grouping
and I wonder if it's going to be game time misspent.  Since I'm not able to
play as often
as I'd like, it's also frustrating to have other group members who shrug off
dying as
not that big of a deal.  It seems to me that those kinds of players really
aren't looking out
for their fellow group members the way you'd like.

The other night I was invited to join a small group to fight Shadowed Men in
Lesser Faydark although the other two members had never fought them before.
After they conned too high for us, it was decided to try
the entrance to Mistmoore (none of us had done Mistmoore either). After a
number of close
calls, I realized that the puller, although fairly high in level, didn't
have enough experience pulling.
So I left the group with buffs and SoW and excused myself from the group.
I've already
died too many times from bad groups to go through another unnecessary death.
