>TRAIN THAT WAS CAUSED BY YOU:

We had a pretty impressive one just last night.

For lack of anything better to do, we were PL'ing a
level 16 Rogue on the bottom floor of Befallen.
Buff the hell out of him, major DS him, then send him
running across the floor.  Being such low level, he
aggroed what seemed to be the entire bottom floor
of the dungeon.  When he came running back to us,
the train of skeletons and necros that came
boiling in after him had even the jaded 57 Ranger
exclaiming, "good god!"

There were so many mobs in the room that half of
them were just running randomly back and forth,
awaiting their turn, and it was hard to see the
Rogue through the swarm.
