    Woo-hoo! Someone in the Beta we can pump for info!! ;-)

    The one report of LDoN I've seen by someone that did break the NDA had
the following points in it:

-15 minutes to get to the dungeon
-1 hour to complete the dungeon task
-because of the number of dead ends, looping passages leading nowhere, etc.
it would be highly suggested to bring along a tracking class if you want to
complete the task
-much of the treasure is in chests. The traps on the chests are very bad,
such as a 4 K AoE DD with a severe resist penalty. It is therefore highly
suggested to bring along a rogue if you want to get the loot without a huge
amount of downtime.
-that bastard Qhue's suggestion of stuff that dispels to ensure outside
buffs don't play as large a role was taken seriously. Many mobs dispel, as
do many traps. Therefore, if you think your group of six requires given
buffs, you'd best have the class along that can cast that buff.

    The thing that concerns me is the implied class dependency. I don't want
to have to reserve a DPS slot for a rogue, for example, to get the loot
there without AoE'ing the entire party. Can you comment on this "required
class" perception without breaking the NDA?

    James
