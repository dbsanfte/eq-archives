My highest level character is Level 18 and I've been playing on and off for
two years.  Granted, I do take 3-6 months off at a time, but still...

While it would be nice to be a higher level so I can try that new
spell/song/whatever, I'm still having fun because there is a LOT to explore
out there.  If you're bored with killing mobs, then work on your skills for
a while.  Take up pottery, or smithing.  Go visit that new and distant
shore...  make some friends that you'd rather sit around and chat with than
fight with.  I never do that, but when you're stuck at a camp waiting for
someone to walk back from their bind point, it does make the down time more
enjoyable.
