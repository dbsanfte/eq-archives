I know someone who has two computers, but only one monitor.  Both
computers are connected to the one monitor via a KVM switch.  When
he's down for 10 minutes of medding or healing, he switches to the
other computer to browse the web or read usenet.  He runs ShowEQ
on that computer, so he can see if anything comes near him while
he is doing this.
