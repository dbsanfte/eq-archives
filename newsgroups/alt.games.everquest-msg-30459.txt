Not necessarily. It is possible to create quests for yourself:

  * My enchanter is on a quest to learn every language on Norrath (and its
moon, eventually.)
  * My warrior is on a quest to cross, by foot, every zone boundary.
  * My druid is working a quest of soloing her first hill giant (sadly,
she keeps failing.) She is also on a quest to become a grandmaster tailor.

With friends or a guild, it becomes very easy to create quests for others.
One fun one went like this:

Tvon stands outside the Qeynos gate, lamenting the fact that he has not
tasted one of Rosewhite's delicious [berry pies] in a long time. When
asked 'What berry pies?' by Lowbie (level 1-6), he hands out a foraged
berry and directs her to visit Rosewhite in Surefall Glade, to the north.
Rosewhite refuses the berry, saying she needs a snake egg, a bottle of
milk and a bag of flour to make the pie. And oh! She had loaned out her
pie tin to her friend Mordant, last seen annoying MacMannus' pretty
daughter in West Karana. Eventually, Lowbie turn in to Rosewhite a pie tin
(from Mordant in the barbarian village in the south west of WK), a foraged
berry, a snake egg, a bottle of milk and a bag of flour to get a berry
pie. Returning the pie to Tvon results in some cash and a nice item like a
fine steel weapon or some player made armor. Of course, the "NPCs" in this
quest keep tabs on who has gotten what, to allow for, "This isn't my pie
tin! I can't use this." and "The pie is good, but not as good as
Rosewhite's. Get me one from her and I will reward you."
