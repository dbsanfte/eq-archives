Screw em. Bind affinity is not a class defining ability, it's nothing
more than a convenient utility for spell casters. No caster is going
to make a big deal about being a `lord of bind affinity'. 

Whereas for melee's it's a complete PITA. A long, slow, dangerous
run across multiple zones and now you have to sit in a newbie area
(the only place you can generally be bound) hoping a high level
caster wanders by.

I would like it, but since rez and porting are class defining
abilities, I wouldn't support it.
