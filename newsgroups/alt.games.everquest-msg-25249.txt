Well, if you mean I don't enjoy BAD movies, you'd be right. But then
in most movies, characters don't re-pop as soon as they die.

Well, if my character has been observing the worl around him, he can
hardly have failed to notice how it works, can he? I think he can

I don't recall arguing that it was an absolutely static environment.
The things that change are the exception, not the rule.
