Actually, quad kiting has more downtime than doing singles.  It's more
efficient in terms of XP per hour, but involves more time medding.  So, for
someone concerned with downtime, quadding may not be the way to go.

On a per mob basis, the single target nukes do more damage per mana than the
AoE nukes.  I'll make up some numbers to illustrate.  Note that these are
just made up.  I didn't go look things up.  The principle is correct, just
not the details.

Say you've got a single target nuke that does 250 damage for 100 mana, and
an AoE that does 200 damage per mob for 200 mana.  To kill a single mob that
has 1000 hitpoints, you'd have to use the single target nuke 4 times, for
400 mana.

If you quadded 4 of those mobs, you'd have to cast the AoE 5 times, for 1000
mana.

Unless it's changed since I played, I think Rangers solo very well from 22.
Snare + Panic Animal + high melee output = awesome soloing, in any zone with
a lot of animals, and there are plenty of those.
