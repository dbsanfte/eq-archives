Undoubtedly some idiot that figured it was a sudden free license to run rampant,
invulnerable, whatever, or be a general a-hole to some players. I can't picture any
scenario where a fifteen minute fresh guide would get their account yanked without
being a *complete* butthead.  But back to the original question, I can think of one
possible advantage to getting in, should you be accepted. If you've never had a
character up at the higher end of the game, you might be able to use your guide
character to scope out some higher level zones that your player character might be
going to later on.  A little, "intelligence gathering" if you will.  (And yes, I know
there still a bunch of zones they won't let a regular guide into, but that doesn't
rule out all of them.)
  And there's also the benefit of eventually getting your regular account for free
(or so I've heard) since saving *any* amount of money is never a bad thing.
