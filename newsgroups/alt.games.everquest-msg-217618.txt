The odds of failing 8 combines in a row with a 5% failure rate is
25,600,000,000 to 1.  You're right, it's not impossible!  Just a
tad bit improbable in the *extreme*, though.  Of course, we all
know EQ's random number generator is streaky, though; I'm not sure
if it's just an incompetent algorithm or by design.  It could use
to be less streaky in my humble opinion, though.

That being said, EQ's tradeskills suck big, green donkey dick.
When things become trivial, they're not even *remotely* trivial,
if you define "trivial" in any reasonable sort of way.
