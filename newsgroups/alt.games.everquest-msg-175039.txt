  you need more beer and sex in your diet.  here is something to think
about.  you're worried about heaven and hell,if you lead a good life,and be
kind to others,don't worry.  if you're worried about going to hell,then
you're gonna go there.  if your actions are good,and your heart is good(not
heart disease either)you have nothing to worry about.
