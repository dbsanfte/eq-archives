Stannypoo you just keep on puffing yourself up, maybe you'll actually BE
someone someday, doubtful, but hey  anything is possible.
If you intend on hacking get the fuck on with it, if not STFU and move

using my oxygen, please refrain from breathing, not like oxygen starvation
will hurt you, you are obviously brain dead already.
