When I first got EQ nearly two years ago (EQ + Kunark + Velious) it came
with a tutorial program. This was basically a very small zone which you
didn't need to be online to play. It had a running commentary to take you
through all the basics of EQ, including movement, talking to NPCs, following
up quests, fighting mobs, casting spells and shopping.

I notice the shortcut to the tutorial is still in my start menu but it
doesn't work. I would have found the game much harder and confusing from the
start if I had never played the tutorial, although I think most of the
information you learn could be found in the manuals that come with the game.
If you read them thoroughly enough.
