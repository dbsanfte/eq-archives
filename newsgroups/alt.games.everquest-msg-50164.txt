Seems to me that if you would get a little higher you could help him
with the greens.  All characters suffer the, "I get killed by a green
while fighting a blue".  He just needs to learn how to pull to open
areas.

Re-rolling a 31 level is a big step for people that level slow.  He
just got out of a hell level.
