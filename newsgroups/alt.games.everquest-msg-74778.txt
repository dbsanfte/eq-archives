Xp is split by level as a proportion of the total levels of the group.
Thus a full group of 50s with one 60 = (50 * 5) + 60 = 310 (levels)
each 50 gets 50 / 310 = 5/31 = 16.12%
the 60 gets  60 / 310 = 6/31 = 19.35%

If everyone was the same level then they would all get 1/6 = 16.67%

Note however that level 60 takes much more xp than level 50 (to fill)
Thus the level 50 players would be advancing much quicker (in terms of
the bar)

It used to be that the curent xp of the player was used (rather than the
level) to decide the split. This was changed <mumbel> months ago.

*NOTE THAT THE BELOW DOES NOT HAPPEN ANY MORE*
If that were still the case then assuming that all the chars were the
same class
the level 60 would have say 616000000xp the level 50s say 165000000.
Simplifying 60=616X 50 =165X total for group = (165 * 5) + 616 = 1441X

The level 60  would have got 616/1441 = 42.75%
The level 50s would have got 165/1441 = 11.45%

I think that you can see why they changed this.
*END OF THINGS THAT DON'T HAPPEN ANYMORE*

HTH,
