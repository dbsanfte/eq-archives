I've been looking at the casters offensive spell capabilities at level 44.
Everyone says wizards are master of direct damage, which they are by 6hp at
level 44 (Same MANA ratio). When it comes to AE Rain spells, they excell
with about 225hp damage, but when can you use your niftly AE Rain spells? In
short..., never. AE Spells? Enchanter keep us in check. So maybe Wizards
have a larger MANA pool to keep them up on the list... but no, that's not
true either.

- They way the game is designed and past patches the wizards primary ability
(which seems to be AE rain spells at level 44) seems to be a waste of time.
99% of groups use crowd control methods such as mezzing, so wizards AE &
Rain spells become unwanted. At level 44, we are reduced to being "a mage
without a pet" in groups, but we nuke for 6hp more at level 44 though...
which should keep me smiling :-|

- Paladins these days also run around with ressurection, and patches making
death not so XP penalized, causes the wizards EVAC ability also to fall
short. Dreadful casting times and poor mana efficiency makes EVAC'ing a
waste of time to mem, since groups do not enjoy a group member not doing
anything 99% of the time and saving mana for an EVAC if something goes wrong
(90% chance that it wont go wrong anyway).

With patches over the years, it seems that while wizards haven't been nerfed
so much (not much to nerf from anyway), but they have been indirectly nerfed
due to other classes gaining new or better abilities, or game designs that
alters the game slightly, that counteracts our class abilities making us
unwanted in groups.

Ok, i know many of you think we are soloers... but think again!
Magicians can nuke for the same damage (well 6hp less..). AE's? Don't really
make us stand out at level 44 either (Enchanters can AE for the same
damage). Only thing we can do quite abit better than others are Rain spells.
But, when can you use them? In short, never! Perhaps if they would stick on
our designated target, but they don't (this might be the design answer for
VI to help wizards).

In groups, i tried to throw in a nuke on every MOB. This cannot be done i
saw quickly. So i figured out that i could help reduce the damage our tank
took from MOBs by casting "Tishans Clash" (a level 20 spells that does 50dd
and 5 second Stun) on every MOB he pulled. This works well, but i'm level 44
now, and it seems abit silly still doing this. VI told me its a group game,
but they didn't give me the abilities a group would need.

After all these updates and pacthes, are there any reasons why a group would
want a level 44 wizard in a group compared to a different class? I know VI
said recently that class nerfs&new abilities are not going to be given on
class balancing issues, but on class needs. Well Verant, our class
NEEEEEEEDS.
If i was forming a group at around level 44, there is no way i would want a
level 40 wizard if i could get any other class to join. Maybe i am not
seeing the obvious, and maybe i am missing some points, but updates,
corrections, thoughts & feedback are welcome.

After looking at the comparrision chart, the case seems even worse than i
thought it was. I bet alot of people out there are suprised too.
