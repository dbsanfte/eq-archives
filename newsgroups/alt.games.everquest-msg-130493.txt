hahahahahahaha.. my claim regarding isreali oppression is DIRECTLY supported
by Noam Chomsky's article that dated more than a decade ago!  were you not
able to understand that part!  Not only that, but i posted a piece from teh
AI article in question, and that directly supports my claim (key words "for
years")!
THINK AND ANALYZE THOROUGHLY.

and you still refuse to analyze my "challenge" posts!

you're replies and your inability to think/analyze is just true comedy.
