There is a taunt value attached to beg (last time i bothered to check) and
there is a tiny purpose to it.  Eventually when your skill is a very high
number like over 100 (ok that isn't really high but it seems like it for
beg) then you can get 1 plat or so from npcs's that have that kind of money.
The guards in West commons like guard valon are perfect examples....If you
beg from the same person long enough there is a chance that it will aggro
them onto you, begging from pets has no ill effects however.
