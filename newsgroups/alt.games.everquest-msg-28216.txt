Is it just me, or does the business of getting around turn into the biggest
problem with the game after a while ?
Personally, I think a portalsystem should be available for everyone. Maybe
at a cost, and with level-limitations or something. On a regular evening I
may have a couple of hours to play, and lately I've found most of it is
spent running from place to place looking for groups. Not a lot of fun.
 Does anyone else have any thoughts on this ?
