well... my cleric (my only cleric) has reached 51... and I have seen
this message numerous times.... it is caused by ...
a recent attempt at a rez on your corpse that failed from
1. you not clicking yes on the question box if its ok to get a rez...
2. an attempt to rez while person being rezed is zoning.

it basicly bugs your corpse just like the group bug that happens.
the way Ive found to clear this issue is have the person that wants
the rez, camp out and back in...  Usualy fixes it in my cases... and
if not  Rezing cleric should log also.

Luck to you.
