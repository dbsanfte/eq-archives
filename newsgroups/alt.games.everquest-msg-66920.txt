Rangers are a hybrid warrior class.  Saying they should get bind would be to
open up the subject for all hybrid classes -- Paladins, Beast Masters,
etc...

As for bind, IMHO it should have a yes/no prompt (like Rez) and it should
allow for binding ANYWHERE anyone can bind.  One of the biggest down sides
to any group adventure is losing your fighters and then the group is stuck
waiting for them to get back or, if you have someone who can rez, waiting
for a rez.

Not bad for upper level chars who can get or do a rez but some lower level
zones are impossible for folks of the appropriate level to hunt at or they
face long runs through dangerous areas to try and get back (hell, my 53
Druid has to use camo in some zones to avoid green aggro.  I'd never venture
my 23 Ranger through those zones because he would have a horrid time running
back to his body).

Bind should be open to all with acceptance being required.
