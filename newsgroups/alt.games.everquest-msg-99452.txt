Heh... Well, going all over the place is par for the course for a druid, 
and most of the items I carry are small or tiny anyway. Part of the 
reason I want quest containers is because most of them have a distinctive 
look (so I can see at a glance which bags contain my food or my charisma 
gear, for example) and weight very little. Seven or eight boxes at 2 to 4 
pounds each it adds up very quickly.

I have nine of those in the bank, plus a Deluxe sewing kit.

I had one for a while, but they are just too heavy.
