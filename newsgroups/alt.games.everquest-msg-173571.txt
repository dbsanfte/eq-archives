Bard songs are funny things.  Some require instruments to run,
some don't (I don't mean singing based ones)

In some cases, a better instrument helps a song, in others it
doesn't.

I have a list of all the songs, and what instruments they work
with, gathered from EQdiva.  However, this doesn't list
"instrument required" or tell what if any affect an instrument
will have on the song.

Selos, for example, can be sung without an instrument, but
benefits very noticably from having a crappy drum, and even more
from a higher quality drum.

Likewise, DOTs seem far more effective with drum, and with good
drum even more so.

I'm told that haste and slow are set effects, that
instrumentation (or augmentation in the case of sung versions)
does nothing.

At any rate, what I'm looking for is a breakdown of songs by a)
instrument required/not required, b) instrument helps/doesn't
help and c) instrument quality helps/doesn't matter.

I'm also looking for an updated version of the extremely old
chart I have showing instrument quality; I don't think my list
shows any SOL instruments, much less the new POP era ones.
