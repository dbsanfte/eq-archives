Actually, I wonder what happens when someone they attack produces a reciept
for the album.  That would make the attack quite illegal.  Of course, the
law states that they couldn't sue, but I wonder how well that part would
stand up in higher courts.  And, of course, if the law was overturned, I
wonder how long it would be until people reported the appropriate record
companies as being cyber terrorists.
