1 add = charm, 2 or more adds = game time decision. you can charm one and
use something of a swarm kite technique to keep the other two busy, but that
doesn't always work that well. Beyond one add, a mezz is generally the safer
approach, but they nerfed the 15 mezz and the 40 mezz seems to be resisted
most of the time, so your milage may vary.

If you're in a group and charming, be VERY careful about who you chose to
charm and when. Your charmed mob becomes somewhat protected, and you don't
want the casters in your group trying to nuke or dot the charmed mob. #1
Rule - COMMUNICATE!
