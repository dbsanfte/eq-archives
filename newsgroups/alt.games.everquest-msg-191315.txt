No I didin't since I saw no point in argueing for Martin as he would have
done it better (although Davian actually did it for him) but, you're right,
I should have put my thoughts across.
The game at that level stops being any sort of RPG (in my eyes) and becomes
a conquest orientated online game. I don't necassarily consider this a good
thing (ok I don't consider it a good thing, period) but that is how SOE have
made it and that is how it is played, or maybe that was how it *was* played
and so that is how SOE cater for it, now.
Just look at the Warrior weapons that have the effect of "Enraging Blow" An
effect that does nothing but work with the game Mechanics to increase "Hate"
by "700" It does nothing else, no damage, no debuff, no slow or snare effect
absolutely nothing to give any reason why it has this effect on a target.
With this in mind I believe that SOE and it's employees should all be towing
the same line when it comes to the end game. What keeps (most) longtime
subscribers playing is these encounters, not the storyline, not the chance
to roleplay their character but the chance to take up the challenge on the
next encounter/test/whatever and so once they take up this challenge (and
considering most of these are not PvP) servers the GM's should be able to
ensure that no other players are able to gain from their work or fuck them
over and come down on the perpetrator if someone does.
The only place these actions could be considered appropriate and nothing to
do with the CS is on SZ, anywhere else and it should have everything to do
with CS Reps.
