*grin* sounds to me like they'd reached a compromise. He did some of the 
damage and they did some of the damage. :) As to the living with it 
part... He lived with it fine, and the others would have too if they'd 
have not been such doorknobs about it.

I've done the same thing, in crushbone even... have a crap day getting 
XP and want to feel like I'm not a complete noob... go to the throne 
room and pay back for some of the times those orcs did me in 5 years 
ago... not that I hold a grudge hehehe.

If someone comes in and completely ignores me and just starts doing 
whatever they want without so much as a "Hi." They don't get a kill 
until I leave. So what if I don't get XP? Maybe I'm there for the belts 
to fix faction. Maybe I'm there because I hate orcs. Or maybe I'm just 
there because I want to be. If they can't understand the idea of a camp 
at a young age they'll just be annoying as hell later on when the spawn 
times are measured in days and not minutes. *shrug* Do they learn 
anything? Probably learn that I'm a jerk, and of all of them that've 
sworn they'd get their ubah-dr00d alt to come kick my arse it's never 
happened. Real players know better than that sort of crap.

So, was it a proper response? Maybe. Maybe not. Have I done it? Yeah. 
Would I recommend it as a way to teach the little people? Nyah. Not 
really. But I don't pay to play teacher to obnoxious, rude, impolite 
little snot-nosed punks. That's why I quit playing Sims. I couldn't 
stand telling the morons to pick their dishes up off the floor.
