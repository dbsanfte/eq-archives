"Dameat ", hmmm sounds like someone who feels the need to brag to cover for
mediocrity in "Dameat" field.

There was nothing wrong with Annie's post nor with Agellin's.

That request for trade  stinks of scam, like your post stinks of bs.  Are you
defensive because maybe it is you looking to run this little charade of trade?

Maybe in a perfect world and time we could trust a totaly stranger with
someone's account and pass but alas the game is fantasy but in the real world
there are scammers waiting to try and bilk people out of what they have.

Say what ya will to my post, don't care what a little man with the moniker of
"dameat" has to say about me.
