Those two statements aren't mutually exclusive. I also regularly group
with 2 druids that can handle healing pretty much anywhere but that
doesn't mean I'm willing to pick an unknown druid as main healer in a
pickup group.

Exactly, and druids suffer the brunt of this because the group role
they tend to fill in PoP is main healer. That tends to be difficult
enough even with a good druid, heaven forbid you get someone that
doesn't know how to play in a group.
