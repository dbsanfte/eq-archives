Perhaps.  But if this is something they plan to add for release, they now 
only have two weeks left to do so.  That doesn't give beta testers much time 
to test the mechanic and /bug it if it doesn't work right.

I would have hoped that all of the final content (ok, so there is no such 
thing as 'final' content in a MMORPG, but I think you understand what I 
mean) would have been in the beta by now with the annouced release date two 
weeks away.  It isn't.  Will they have tested everything internally?  Of 
course.  Will they catch all the bugs that way?  Nope.
