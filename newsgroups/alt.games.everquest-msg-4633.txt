Your pet is what your class is all about.  If you want to play a mage
with no pet, switch to wizzard.

Pet does damage for you, takes hits for you, and casts specialty
spells for you at no mana cost, and also "taunts" to get the attention
of mobs that are beating on the wrong things.

Unfortunately, Verant has set things up to screw with your perceptions
at very low levels; for the first few you are actually a better combatent
than your pets are; you'll need to protect them instead of relying on
them to protect you.

Try this command:

/pet no taunt

Approach a nice mob, and hit it with a Nuke and back up to a
safe fighting area where you won't get more mobs wandering in
on your fight.  It runs in to attack you.
Stand there and melee it, your pet will join in once you are
attacked.  Using the same techniques you did without the
pet, you'll find the fights are over twice as quickly, you are
at twice the mana and HP totals at the end of the fight, and
your pet will be healthy and ready to go again long before
you are.

Once you've mastered this, start looking at making the
fights go even better.  The more damage you can arrange
to have the pet absorb without dying the better, because
the pet will heal ten times as fast as you will.  Keeping your
mana use down to a low roar is another important technique,
as your pet won't have to regen mana at all, so you'll be ready
for the next fight all the sooner... and you'll have lots of mana
available for sudden kill when and if something goes wrong.

Lets repeat that last for clarity:  Its not your job to kill things
fast and then spend a lot of time medding, its to kill things
with reasonable speed but be ready as posssible for disaster,
and to minimize the down time you'll spend between fights.
This is the problem with the wizard class: to contribute at
all to a fight they need to spend mana, while you can literally
get thru relatively "clean" battles without spending a bubble,
yet having done as much in the fight as any other character.
THis is going to be true for the rest of your career; one
reason Mages are often disparaged in groups is that so
few of them seem to understand this.

Pet types:
Earth: casts root.  Very nice, when a fight is going bad
you can just back off, it will stay on the pet, and you
can start nuking with no fear of being interrupted.  Also
has lots of HP so it can take a beating for a while.
Water: casts a DD nuke while it fights, just a little more
crunching away at that mob.  Decent HP and avoids
getting hit a little better than the Earth one.
Fire: Has a "damage shield" so that every time it
gets hit the thing hitting it takes damage.  Unfortunately,
low HP and the fact that at low levels the last thing you
want is your pet taking damage a lot means this isn't very
useful
Air: casts a Stun that will make those mobs do nothing
but stand still for a few seconds time and again.  HP is
a little better than fire, but it is also better at not getting
hit.  My personal favorite most of the time, but largely
because a bonus from the stun is that this interrupts casters...
which you shouldn't be facing many of  at your level.

Here's a tip:  Get ahold of a cheap rusty weapon, the higher
the damage the better, and give it to your pet.  This is only
really useful till 12th level, as by then your pet will be doing more
damage than that produced by the weapons... but an 8 damage
weapon (rusty scythe, 4 gold cost at a vendor) will let your
wimpy 4th level pet do 16 points a blow... keep that pet alive
and he'll chop thru reds for you in no time.
