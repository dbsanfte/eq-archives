Tell your friend there's a new recipe:
two velium bits + one sandalwood (bought off any alchemy merchant) inna
forge = one spool of coldain thread.

This is a good shortcut. Means no wolf whiskers, siren hair, manticore
manes, or frost giant beards.

(Tarre has a few of these sitting in her bank in anticipation of shawl 6)

But on the other hand, Tarre the necro and Jakiss the wizzie are having our
own difficulties figuring out how to successfuly duo well- he can quad so he
wants to, I get three AoEs in my entire career, two of which I don't have
yet... so it's tricky...
