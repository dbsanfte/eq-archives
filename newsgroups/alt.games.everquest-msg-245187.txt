Nadox Inny trigger wasn't up.  I haven't yet re-camped the parts for
the Hate's Fury triggered event.  We did HAL once, that was enought.
Mujaki doesn't hold much interest and all the folks who need Vekhiz parts
have them already.  PoNb Terris was dead.

Yeah, but we seemed to feel we wouldn't be getting the additional 
player power we'd need i.e. 1 more chanter and 1 more cleric.  Otherwise
we'd have probably gone for another attempt.
