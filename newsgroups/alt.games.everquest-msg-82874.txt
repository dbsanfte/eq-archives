Evil is:
Pulling an exp mob back to the group and it is practically dead before you
can turn around
Casting Flash of Light on your low MR opponent in a duel
Running through GFay with a tree chasing you and yelling for help (druid
dragging their tree-form corpse)
Telling newbies to move before you attempt to jump from the Kelethin
platforms or they will take massive damage for your landing on them
When you are begged to death by a newbie you give your out of date weapon to
the PoD, or if unavailable the closest guard
Running through newbie zone with a low delay bow and fleeting quiver
alternately pressing F8 and Range Attack (ever know that you can shoot on
the run :-) ). Oh & be warned, guards don't like arrows :-)
Beating your groupmate to a place when they left before you because you know
the most direct route and he followed the path
Shouting 'LOADING.....PLEASE WAIT...'
