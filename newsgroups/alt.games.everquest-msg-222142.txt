In my case, I've been playing since beta 4 and I've raised enough
characters the only way I'd find it interesting to play untwinked
through 1-60 would be if I had a group of friends all playing the same
way so we could do out of the way dungeons. Even there, I've explored
most of the 1-60 dungeons already at level appropriate times over the
years so there's really not much there for me unless I'm showing someone
else around, which I already did with my enchanter and some real life
friends a few years ago. 

Now, if I'm going to twink up a character to play it's going to be with
my existing friends, all of whom are L65 now. It took me 13 days played
to get my rogue to 65 with SoS. I also had run 3 and regen 3 but that
was from leeching flags when we were backflagging recruits. I had fun
the last 5 levels because I could do LDoN adventures with my guildmates.
Sometimes after raids, thanks to the high requirement for clerics in
high end raiding guilds, there's just not enough groups to go around for
all the clerics LFA, so having a rogue lets me group a lot more. There
always seems to be a spot for a dps class and our guild is down to about
5 active rogues at the moment.
