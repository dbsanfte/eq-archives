Shamans, like Bards can be pretty demanding in groups to play.  Buffing,
De-Buffing, Slowing, Healing, DoTing etc... all while trying to canni up
mana.  They are still much easier over all than playing a rogue.  True all
my rogue had to do is show up, hit auto attack, evade ocasionally and ask
for buffs :) but they are very difficult to level because they are extremely
dependent on other people.  A rogue can't solo worth shit, even in a pinch.
Most classes have some way of getting out of trouble if they are travelling
and get aggro'd, not so a rogue.  Evade only works if there is something to
take the place of the aggro on the rogue.  Low HP and inability to damage in
head on fighting means rogues can be dusted easily by even LB MOB's.  So if
you want to see the world as a rogue, you better do it with Hide/Sneak and
get used to doing it very slowly.
