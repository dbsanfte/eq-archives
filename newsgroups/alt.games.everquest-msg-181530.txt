You missed his point.  Merely offerring an item at a "great" price
as a bazaar trader does not assure you of a quick sale.  If the
players that make up your prospective market are not actively looking
for the item or type of item you're selling they'll never know about
your great price.  Which is where a /auc with a link and price can be
helpful in moving an item.  I've bought a number of items that way.
Unfortunately a good 75% of the /aucs and a pretty solid 100% of the
/oocs and /shouts are some numbwit trying to sell for more than the
going price by claiming that they're selling something "cheap".
