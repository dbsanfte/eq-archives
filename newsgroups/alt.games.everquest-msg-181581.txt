I don't see any problem with it.  I just wish that, as with other
"enhancements", they didn't charge extra for it.  The only reason I
bought Luclin was it's almost impossible to buy or sell anything
outside the bazaar.  Same thing with travel and PoK.

I'm losing interest in the game in general.  It has devolved to
camp/kill/repeat with some interaction with NPCs that say canned
messages and won't recognize me when I hail them again.  I guess if I
wanted actual interaction I could move up to "Legends", but again, it
costs more.

If only the trolls would take over Freeport...
