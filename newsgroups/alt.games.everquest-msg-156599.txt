I wouldn't worry about Sta bonus at this point in the game. In the lower
levels you want mana, hp, and ac producing items. Gold Jade bracelets,
Chrysoberyl Talisman
Split Paw gloves these are all very reasonably priced. Once you get invis
and Sow get a port to DSP and head over to Maidens Eye. Some very nice No
Drop Lore Items are laying around you could pick up for free, (tad bit
risky).
