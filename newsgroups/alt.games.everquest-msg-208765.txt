There's one coming.  You will not be able to log in for the next 2 months
while they patch all servers.  I am sorry to say that that means school will
be in session when the patch is complete.  I'm sure that SOE will make it up
to you.  BTW, if anyone tells you that they are able to log in, they are
lying to you and just trying to get you really mad.
