I'd agree with you if you were talking about a random guy sending you
a tell when you were minding your own business asking for that 900
mana buff.  However, when you're sitting in the Nexus for several
hours casting KEI for "donations" once a minute, I'm much less
sympathetic to the "it's a lot of mana, therefore you owe me lots of
money for casting it!" argument.
