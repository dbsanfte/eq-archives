There's nothing wrong with preventing multi-tasking... in fact, that is even
one of the original concepts of DirectX. DirectX is basically an API
originally designed to manage resources. When you Alt+Tab in and out of a
game, you generally notice a sharp decrease in your frame rate and generally
system performance.

So, if anything, it's probably a combination of Verant's paranoia and
DirectX. I can successfully Alt+Tab out of EQ since I'm using Win2000, but
it does create a lot of problems for me - it's something that games weren't
meant to do in the first place.

Do you really need to use Quicken while shooting people in Quake 3? Nahh...
that's why you can't Alt+Tab out of it.

Verant isn't exactly trying to monopolize your time... not this way, at
least.
