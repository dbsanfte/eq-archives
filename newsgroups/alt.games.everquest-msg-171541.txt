"If you cannot cancel your EverQuest subscription online or you are
having problems canceling your account, you can contact The Station
Customer Service team at (858) 537-0898. Customer Service
Representatives are available weekdays from 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM PST
(11:30 AM to 8:30 PM EST), except holidays. 

If you are not in the USA, or can not call, email
accounts@station.sony.com with the following pieces of information: 

EverQuest Station Name
Account Key(s)
Billing Address
Birthdate
Zip Code"


Note how they are not asking for your password, but rather
your "account key." Those are the keys from the cds you used to 
register. So you have to find at least one CD I think.
