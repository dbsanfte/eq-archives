What you've heard from other people, or what you've heard from sites
releasing interviews/videos/etc?  If it is the latter, then I'm surprised
to say the least.  It wouldn't surrise me if someone just decided they
didn't like decisions made about the game, but from the plethora of things
we've seen (combat system, magic system, reports of 1500+ quests already
in place, fascinating tradeskill system, etc etc etc...oh, and
voiceovers), it is definitely more than just pretty graphics. More = good
or more = bad...that I don't know yet. :P
