Don't feel bad, Cursim. Lots of people have trouble with the concept -
you're not the only one.

You are the one making these claims, so it is up to you to prove them,
not me. 

The situation that you are getting so upset about is largely hearsay
even to *you*, as you are not the GM or the cleric in question.
Anything you know about their discussion you've received second hand.
That you trust your cleric friend is admirable, but surely you
understand why the world at large isn't in a hurry to embrace this
second hand story?

You've asked us for reactions, and we've reacted. *If* what you
described is actually true, or taken as a hypothetical, it certainly
sucks.

However, some of us have been here for years now, and have heard
countless tales of woe told for no other reason than to stir up anger
against Verant or a GM. We really don't get excited about these things
any more, especially in the absence of any supporting evidence.
