Well considering I've been around since Phase 3 of beta I believe I know of
good places to take low-mid lvl characters.
So you think it's right to have zones just for high lvl players but it's not
right to have them aimed for low-mid lvls?
As for equipment drop for appropriate lvls, they have them like that in the
Planes, why not anywhere else?  As in a zone made for low-mids.
Most high lvls I've ran into think the game is all about them and high lvl
players.  The shoot from lvl 1-60 then bitch about not having anything to do
and some have said "If Verant doesn't give us high lvl people something new
I'm gonna cancel my account."  So Verant ends up releasing Planes, exp pak,
spells, armor, etc to them to make them happy and not lose them.
Say I'm bitching or whatever, just saying it's not right to keep doing thing
after thing for the high lvls and very few things for low-mid lvls, when
high lvls have a whole exp pak to themselves plus maybe one in the works.
