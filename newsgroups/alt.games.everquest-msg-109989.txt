Not at all. I'm using the supplied definition, which states "Anything
which impairs". Surely the sun falls under the "anything" category.

Again, I direct you to the supplied definition, and its use of the
term "anything". What my replies to that definition do is to
demonstrate that the definition, like all others presented so far, is
flawed.

You can refute it, but you'd be wrong. 2+2=4 is true by definition,
demonstrable, and provable. A definition of evil is not.

We can argue reasonably about those terms - that's what we've bene
doing all along. Every time someone attempts to define the terms, I
very reasonably demonstrate the flaws in the definition.

From there we see the higher-level debate, which is whether or not
there exists an absolute definition for the terms.

So we agree that the A-1-2 definition was flawed. Good, we can
dispense with it then.

So you've demonstrated that Person A is intellectually dishonest. In
the scenario you present, I don't disagree with that conclusion. But
it doesn't say anything at all about there being a true definition of
evil, just that A isn't very mature.
