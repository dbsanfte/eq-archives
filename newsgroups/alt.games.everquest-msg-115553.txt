Sounds like she's just being a bit of a jerk, or merely has no social
skills. After all, she came to you to port you knowing you had little
to give. She wasn't talking about a "horsie fund", was she?

Got that before. Unfortunately, any time you're dealing with a
commodity like porting, some people suffer from the mistaken
impression that there is one universally understood set price. What
kills me is you don't see the 20pp only porter turn down a 10pp port.
They just give you grief about it. Personally, I don't mind being on
the shit list of someone with that kind of attitude. I'm tempted to
toss 'em a parting comment (after the port of course :) allong the
lines of, "I normally give an amount proportionate to the level of
courtesy I'm shown. Looks like I overpaid again."

Nah, there are bad apples in every barrel. Karma will take care of
them.
