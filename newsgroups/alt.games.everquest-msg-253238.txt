Playing an off gender avatar isn't the focus. Lying to people about your 
true gender is, the gender of your avatar is almost irrelevant.

How can you call someone a 'friend', when you find out they've lied (or 
allowed you to form a misconception and then perpetrate for their own 
amusement) about such basic traits as their gender? What sort of 
'friend' is that?

Or were you "Annie" just friends with the fantasy persona of "Legolad 
the Elf"?

Either way I wouldn't call those friends.

Or were you "Annie's character' just friends with the fantasy persona of 
"Legolad the Elf"? And if so, how can you call your characters friends 
your own?
