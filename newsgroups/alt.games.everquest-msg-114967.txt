Anyone else get the feeling that someone at verant has the hots for Tunare
and almost hates Karana?  It's becoming obscene how much better things are
for wood elves who follow the druid/ranger path in life.  I don't really
care as far as halflings are concerned...they have great stats and an xp
bonus, so they can live without the cool items...but humans and half-elves
can worship Karana too!

And don't get me started on how half-elves can't do _anything_
cultural.  I'd love to see them implement quests where a half-elf could
become an "honorary human" or "honorary elf" (and you couldn't switch
around) for the purposes of cultural trade skills.
