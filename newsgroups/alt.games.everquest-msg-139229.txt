More to the point, he's generalizing M$'s word for what's acceptable in 
microsoft.* newsgroups to all of USENET.

Despite the fact top-posting may be acceptable in some places, it is not 
acceptable here.  If you do it, you will be flamed for it.  That's all you 
really need to know, and any other justfication is entirely secondary.
