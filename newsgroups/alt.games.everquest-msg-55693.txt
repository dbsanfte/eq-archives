You forgot Kerafyrm...

I like how FoH killed Tunare because they were bored one day, she drops some
real crappy stuff for difficulty level, just takes a big zerg force.  =P

Then again, a bored uberguild or two on Tarew Marr killed that gnome at the
Nro docks (the normal gnome), he dropped a bit of spare change... that's it.

In terms of server boards, for Tarew Marr I would've said www.abiplanet.com
but they seem to have had some internal issues lately and are not working.
