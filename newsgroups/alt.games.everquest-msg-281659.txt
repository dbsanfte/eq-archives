It seems to be directly related to memory, CPU power, and video board.
Back when I was using an older ATI Radeon VIVO (7500 with s-video in
and out), 1.2GHz PIII, XP Pro, and only 512MB of memory it could take
up to five minutes before I was back in EQ after hitting the windows
key. Upgrading to an AMD 64 3800+, nVidia 6500, 1GB RAM, and WinXP 64,
it's almost instantaneous; I can be back in EQ within 5 seconds or less
if I accidentally hit the Windows key.

My wife, using XP Home on a 1.4GHz P4, nVidia 6500, and 768MB memory
loses about 30 seconds if the Windows key is accidentally pressed.

Bizzarly enough, I never had an issue with entering EQ windowed mode in
XP, even before SP2. If I hit the windows key, the system would hang
for a few minutes (usually three or four) then EQ would come up
windowed with the Start menu up. My guess is it's because I had XP Pro
and not Home. Pro seems to have a better compatability implementation.

Xiphos - EQ really does suck up more resources than the video quality
it provides justifies.
