I am so confused by this mentality...  To me (and yes I am talking
about me) its about the adventure... not the end points.  I look at
the end points as the ultimate goal, but there are other things
involved.  Drops, exp, comradeare....  

Yes it sucks to have a lame group... but when you are left with 4
peeps that have their heart in the right place... you can turn it into
a decent exp grind...  No, its not a tier 2/3 exp, but it is decent
and better than old world.
