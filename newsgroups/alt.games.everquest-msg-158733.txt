Wait a second...they had a Wizard, who may have been 29+, which would mean
they had an evac to NK available, with 9 second casting time.  They would
also have Lesser Evac (level 18 spell) to take the group to the zone
safespot, with a 10.5 second casting time.

So, while running as soon as run is called is the right thing, calling for
run in the first place might not have been right.
