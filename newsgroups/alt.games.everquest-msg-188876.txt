whatever character you choose, know that you will probably not stick with
it.  Check out http://eq.castersrealm.com and go to the class sections.
choose one you think you'd like to play.  you have 8 slots to use for
different characters and if you fill them all up and don't like one, delete
it and the slot is immediately available.

Some suggestions to start (to at least learn) are a warrior, a paladin or a
monk.  These three will allow you to learn the ropes without too much
worrying about all the little details.
