Like others have said, best is #1, but leave his equipment on his
characters. If you clear his characters of gear, he will be less
likely to want to return at a future date. I had a friend who declared
he was done with EQ. SO he offered his equipment and said his
farewells. Well, 3 months later, he wanted his stuff back - doh! 6
months later - he left again, only to return... again. Hes since left
yet another time, and I can feel his urge to come back yet again,
although he HAS been away for a year this time - and his wife left him
- not for playing too much EQ, just shes one messed up evil wench
(Wont go into details - but basically left him and their 3 kids so she
could go party and stick needles in her arm with some gutter trash
asswipe).
