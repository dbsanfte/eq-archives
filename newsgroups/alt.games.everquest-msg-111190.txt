My husband and I also have a shaman/warrior combo.  This is what we call
our Power House team....like this person said, it's a very strong and
stable combination.  Throw them in a dungeon, they can just bull their way
through.  Put them outside, they can pull forever.  The AC of the shaman
means they can sometimes even take heat off the warrior if it is needed in
a pinch.

However, we also have a druid/shadowknight combination.  We call this our
Elite Strike Force (ok, it's a cheesy name!).  With a pre-nerf CoS on the
SK, we can get in a lot of places unseen (without undue stress on the
caster to keep the melee invised), find the mob we want with track, snare
it, smack it down REALLY fast with HT and DDs, then evac the heck out of
there with loot/quest item in hand.  It's great when you want that one mob
in a scary dungeon, especially dungeons that are hard to get back out of
(drogah, for example).   

I love both of our teams...and depending on my mood, I can be as
sneaky/subtle or run-in-smashing as I like.
