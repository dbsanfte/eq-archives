The interesting thing is that the recipes are for level appropriate
things, I think, which your low level character could be making. I
think the craft system in that game might be quite good since you
"level" for the skill just like you would killing stuff, with 100
percent success if you have the skill/items.

I'd wager more stuff is in later. It would seem kind of silly to have
that be the only stuff.

Not really. They've been a long time coming and there were many flaws.
Tradeskill smiths only had banded to make forever and a day, those
were dark times. You could skill up to max banded skill in a couple
hours, then you were done.

I think the way to prevent that it is more friendly, and better looked
upon in general, to kill your own mob. Its not that rewarding in the
long run to try to steal from others.
There were lowbie kill stealers in EQ who also learned that it doesn't
work the best, or they were allowed to die by the other players
("help! oh help! Why won't you guys help now? All I did was try to
steal the mobs!")

The same thing that does in EQ, griefing brings grief to themselves.
Its a social game and people have good memories.

If its the game I think you mean, it seems to not take money. Doing
the tradeskill you can get the raw materials yourself then make stuff.
A very neat thing that I saw is how you get a newbie kit of all the
tools you need, free from the guildmaster.
The recipe thing is interesting in that you can "scribe" them just
like spells.

I thought of that. Since the resources are "spawns", with graphical
representations you interact with, too many players would make it
difficult to get resources unless they spawned faster or you played at
weird times.

Yeah. I'm hoping there are drops too. Perhaps they are just doing the
reverse of EQ and making sure that the HARDER stuff, like tradeskills,
works well from the start. Putting drops on mobs is easy, any design
flunky can do that,  putting in a balanced tradeskill system is hard.
What I saw looked pretty good.
