The one interesting thing I've heard, from someone who had gotten a lot of
GBS', and seemed to know what he was talking about, was that if you follow
the storyline, you'll always get a GBS.  There's a place in the story where
Pyz has to have a GBS for the story to make sense, and people who kill her
at that point seem to always get one.

GBS dropped a lot in price since the old days.  As far as the stats go,
there are as good or better items that are far more common.  Heck, Stein of
Mogguk is almost as good (1 more int, but probably not as good for resists
in most cases).  What the GBS has is a cool look...but the expansions have
given many items with that look, so it is nothing special that way.
