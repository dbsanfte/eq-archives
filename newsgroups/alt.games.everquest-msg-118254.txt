try this

me holding a bow, as always, standing around for a bit (don't...get ahead of
me)

dumbkitty (funny that) : Can you port me to wc?
Me : I'm a ranger, I can't port
dumbkitty: Noob, just port me. It doesn't cost you anything
Me : /em waves his bow in %t's face
Me : Hello, ranger here. Rangers can't port. You need a druid
Dumbkitty : flames curses and profanities I won't repeat
Dumbkitty proceeds in shouting to the whole zone that I'm a lame ass that
lies about not being able to port
Zone : Dude, do a /who It clearly says ranger. Rangers can't port
dumbkitty : well he looked just like the guy that ported me the last time

That silenced me for a moment. I've seen stupitidy, and in generous amounts
too, but this just about took the cake.

Oh well, much fun to be had with kitties as it would seem.
