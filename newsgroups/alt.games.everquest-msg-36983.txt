I actually run into great people in the game. Kind, generous, considerate.

Went to Erud's E'ci with my low level necro. There was a PvP+ player there
that wanted to group, so what the hey, I felt sorry for him.

So we group, I send my pet in after a wisp and get a group of 2-3 of them
beating on me. I notice the PvP+ player is not hiting anything or making a
single cast. One level later, the wrong way, I start looking at my log. I
scrolled through 19 straight pages of "A wisp hits you for xx damage" w/o
seeing the PvP+ player attempt a single spell or take a single swing. OK, I
should have known the guy was an asshole solely on the basis of his PvP+
status. Still amazing that I lasted that long. He denied everything of
course, "I was OOM" kind of bs. I could have just about swam back to Qeynos
in the time he did nothing.

Then late last week I am fooling around with my ranger. I get the standard
"buttmunch is inspecting you" while I am banking.
"RU lookin to by sum shoulders?"
I have the chr with a mix of fairly nice stuff including +5 str shoulder
armor at the time, so I.
"Sorry, only have 95 pp in the bank" Damn fletching and thinking if he has
already seen my stuff, must be something spectactular.
"that's enuff. i have some banded 1s i can sell you for 30pp"
"they R worth 60"

I'm going to have to start keeping score on people that inspect me. I mean
every once in a while you get someone that inspects you and feels sorry for
you. I once had a druid in a hurry pay something like 50+ pp for a set of
bear hide boots I was wearing. Mostly I get inspected by twinks wanting to
make sure their twinked advantage will insure a win, people trying to cheat
me, people trying to annoy me.
