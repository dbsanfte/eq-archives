Never heard of swimming in the river to avoid the spiders. Somehow I don't
think that will work, but anything's possible. You say you have a song, eh?
That means you are a bard! Equip your drum and sing selo's ya goofball.
Follow the river as previously told. My bard has never been killed by
those stinking spiders, despite aggroing many on my way to the lake. They
are fast, but a bard with drum equipped should have no problem outrunning
them.
