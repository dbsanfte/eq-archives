 The world of EQ is too big to travel the way we used to. 

 I'd be curious to hear your proposal for the EQ travel system. How do
you want people to get to PoP? To SoL? To travel between the different
expansions?

 And the boats are still there. I assume so anyway although I haven't
checked. You are free to use them and run across zones if thats what
makes the game a fun, challenging, immersive experience for you.
