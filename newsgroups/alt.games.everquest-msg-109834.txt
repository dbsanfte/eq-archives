ok, if you plan on soloing for the rest of your career, get 1HS up and get
yourself as good a  1HS weapon as you can.  Druid Epic is 1HS.  IF you are
planning on grouping more often than soloing, I would get a decent 1hs,
train a few points, work some low mobs and not worry about it too much
because you won't be very effective in melee anyway and you'd be more
helpful to the group sitting on yer tush medding than jumping into the fray.
in either case, your days of fighting hand to hand are pretty much over, use
it only as a last resort.
