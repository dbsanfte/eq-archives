Greetings,

The other night I fell into the pool of water around the port-in point
from the Nexus to Shadowhaven.

To my dismay I discovered that the "bank" around the pool seems to be
too high to get out of the water normally.  I was also low on mana and
couldn't cast Gate to free myself (which wouldn't even be an option
for melee types).  Eventually I was fortunately able to acquire enough
mana to Gate out, but it took a VERY long time while swimming.

Has anyone else experienced this problem.  If there is no way to get
out of the water, it seems that corpse runs would become quite a
hassle as well without a necro.

Cheers,
