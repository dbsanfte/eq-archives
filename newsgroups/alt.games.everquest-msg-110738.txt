Your comparing a rangers exploit versus a druids capabilities in a raid?
lol...

Which other spells become less mana, the more effective and higher level
they become?   (Im refering to heals and buffs, not Mage/Wizz nukes, which I
know become more dmg/less mana)

I know the mana usage for SoW, BoF etc goes up with the higher level of the
ac buffs...

A lot of the casters in my guild prefer PoTG

It doesnt stack with the cleric 'hp/ac' line of spells (resolution, heroic
bond, aego etc).. but it DOES stack with the AC buff (BoF) and HP buff
(symbol of marzin)

And IIRC, PoTG+BoF+Marzin is more HP then Aego (maybe not so now with group
aego). and it has mana regen.

?  Druid mana regen stacks with Enchanter regen...
Your resist buffs dont need to stack with anything, because you get the BEST
cold and fire resist buff (not including bard songs here, which they DO
stack with)
You also get that super hp regen, the name escapes me.. but its several
hundred HP regen over a very short period.

> On my wish list for druids would be to make some of our buffs stackable.

Your mana regen stacks, your resist buffs stack with bard resist songs, your
DS stacks with CoE (small DS) and DS items..

> Stackable DS with Mages would help mages too.

It was an exploit when it happened

> Stackable Regen with Shamies would be awsome, but could be a game breaker

Its generally the same spell anyway..

> - same with HP/AC buffs (like PoTG) and cleric buffs.

PoTG already does.
