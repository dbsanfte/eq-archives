Oh, I should add to my prior post.

I run with all models on, clipping plane at 100, all effects on high, 
1280x1024 resolution, no shadows.  The only time I have to reduce the 
settings at all is on a raid, where I remove all spell effects except my 
own.

The system you are installing the card in will have a significant impact on 
performance as well however.
