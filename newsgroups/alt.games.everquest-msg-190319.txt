    The majority of groups aren't that good at all, as anybody who regularly
switches between soloing and grouping can tell you. Your arguments are also
flawed in a few key areas.

    Chain pulling, as you put it, means that for a portion of the fight,
someone who would otherwise be adding DPS is off chasing mobs around, or
being chased by them. This is not *much* more of an efficient model than a
soloist who immediately pulls again after his mob dies. Aside from the fact
that some soloists chain pull themselves (pulling to pet or root-rotting)
even chain pulling means that you must haul the mob all the way back to
where your group is fighting the previous mob - and most not-chain pulling
runs along the same lines. A soloist usually doesn't have to pull any great
distance at all. My last level in dreadlands was done by kiting mobs all
over the shop - avoiding adds was a real challenge and shitloads of fun. I
was chain pulling for most of it - pulling at point blank and doing very
little kiting at all before fear landed, selectively going for dark blues
and rarely having much of a gap between swinging my weapon at all. Only the
very *fastest* groups I've been in pull more efficiently than that. An SK on
his own is slow DPS by almost anyone's standards (even c3 doesn't pay for
much nuking), but if you're at a level where your pet adds anything at all,
things ain't so bad - and pets take away almost zero exp.

    Super high DPS: Yup, a group consisting of a monk, a chanter and 4
wizards will have super high DPS. Your average group, consisting of some
sort of puller, a tank, a cleric, a backup healer, maybe a nuker, a
slower/haster and some assorted hackers, does NOT have super high DPS. Many
of the classes I just listed have more dps on their own than a soloist, but
when you add on the fact that at least one member of the group is sitting on
his arse adding zero dps whatsoever, the ratio drops. And it drops again
when that person runs oom anyway and the entire group sits on their butt
wasting time.

    About half the groups I've been in have been melee heavy AND had no
haster. I refer to this strategem as "beating mobs to death in slow motion"
and it is especially pitiful exp.

    Furthermore, groups consist of people of varying levels. If you're level
40 and you group with a level 48 person, they eat much more of the gained
exp regardless of how good or bad your or their dps is. Mobs might be
borderline for giving them exp, and would normally be quite good for you,
but you will advance at the same rate they do - even considering they're 8
levels more expensive per bubble. In this situation, if both the 40 guy and
the 48 guy were soloing, the level 40 guy would see experience he would
consider reasonable, and so would the level 48 guy. If they group, the 40
guy slows the 48 guy down and the 48 guy eats most of the resulting
experience. I noticed a huge drop at 40/41 when I lef the overthere for the
dreadlands - I went from being a high level in my groups to being the
lowest. (yes I went back hence 40/41 not just 40 - but things in OT were
cyaning it up pretty quick)

    That said, I do agree that some groups absolutely kick ass. I had some
very good times with one group which had a chanter pulling (haven't seen one
do it since) - true chain pulling since chanters dont generally add dps
except through buffs which were kept up anyway, and we would conclude one
fight, turn around and immediately start on the next mob which was mezzed
behind us. Another time I actually managed to con a bard into joining my
(melee heavy) dreadlands group, and we splatted mobs faster than I've ever
seen them go down before or since. At the time I was convinced this was
because bard haste stacked with spell AND item haste, but apparently this is
not the case. What must have been occuring was that his melee buff songs
were upping our atk to stupid levels, and we simply never missed, and did
more damage on average than usual when we hit. We also had chanter haste,
and at one stage two rogues - fights were hilarious even to listen to,
constant thumping and yelping from mobs followed by a death a few seconds
later.

    The only time I've ever found myself in a caster heavy group, after 52
levels, was one that consisted mostly of druids and mages (vague memories
here). As I recall, they and I thought it was very easy going, but the
experience was inferior to soloing.

    Not that I don't absolutely drool at the thought of landing an efficient
melee heavy group. I would walk a seriously long way to land one, and
happily go to any effort of pulling tanking or kiting to be involved in
one - although more because of the fun factor than the experience.

Cheers,
James
