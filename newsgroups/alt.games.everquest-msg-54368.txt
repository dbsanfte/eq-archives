That one is nice, 4 ac and 16 percent haste which is 4 percent less
than FBSS. The nice thing about it is it will probably cost less than
the FBSS. I have no idea if I got lucky or not but one time a guy was
auctioning one and I had a blackened crystilline robe and rygorr legs
which I could not sell for like 4 days, offered them to him and he
said okay. So my sk twink got a swirlspine belt ;) Its level 33 now
and the belt has served it well and I have no desire to ever get an
FBSS instead.

I thought those were a monk item.. as in haste only if you attacked
with hands.
