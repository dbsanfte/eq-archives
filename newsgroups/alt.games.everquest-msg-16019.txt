Well, think of it like this, except in rivervale, family is very
important to halflings.  The children are so quiet and discreet that
they aren't noticed.  

"Now Johnny, don't bother that hardened adventurer, he might hurt you
with that sword.  Now be quiet and go back into the house."

"Now Lenia, I remember when I was still young and strong enough to
battle evil.  IF you are good, and eat your Jum-Jum, You can be like
that Brave adventurer there."

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
