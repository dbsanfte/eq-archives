All healed at 0 HP:
1000 total HP:  750 pt heal.
2000 total HP:  1500 pt heal.
3000 total HP:  2250 pt heal.
4000 total HP:  2925 pt heal.
5000 total HP:  2925 pt heal.
and so on.

It never heals more than 75% of the total hitpoints the person
has.  And it has an upper limit of 2925 hitpoints, if that is
less than 75% of the character's total.  On a character with
(roughly) 4000 HPs, it's identical to a CHeal hitting at 25%.

It's certainly NOT CHeal.  But it's efficient enough to allow
druids to heal in high-level XP groups in some places and
groups where they can't now.

> XP groups are where you do need efficiency.

Clerics on test report they can't get groups due to the
efficiency of the new heals.  Make of that what you will,
but it's certainly what I've heard.  Except for zones where
you really need a *good* group (CT), the new heals are more
than sufficient.
