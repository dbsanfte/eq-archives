     Okay, I've been on Everquest going on 2 weeks now. I've only stuck to one
character, and that is a human warrior. It's at level 14. My question is for
the new players, and veterans alike. I don't want this to seem like a poll, or
anything of that nature, just a question out of curiousity.

     What type of character is your favorite to play, and why. What is the
worst type of character/class to play in your opinion? Okay, I lied. A few
questions hehe. Thanks in advance. And if it seems like a poll, and ya hate
polls, I'm sorry :o).
