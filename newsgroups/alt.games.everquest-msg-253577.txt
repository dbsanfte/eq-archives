Lotus Elise, 0-60 in 4.9 from a non-turbo/supercharged 4-cylinder, and Lotus
is known for exceptional handling.

New for under-40k.  Cheaper than a vette.  Holds it's value better, though,
so might have to wait longer than four years to get comparable price.  =)

Lancer Evo, WRX, aforementioned Elise, and the cheapest SRT-4.

But let's hear it for the wolves in sheep outfits.  I used to race my dad's
Stanza wagon, 4-cylinder manual, against Mustang 5.0s and was never beat
0-60 (of course, I was still in second gear at 60...  poor dad didn't know
what I was doing to his car).  I doubt anyone ever even timed that car to
60, cause, well, it was a station wagon, and a funky looking one at that. 
But that car made me a believer in Japanese 4-cylinders.   =)
