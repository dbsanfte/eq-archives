Yeah, that's why I opened with the caveat.  But I was disagreeing with
your statement that they ought to "balance" all loot rewards to the
difficulty of the mob.  And since the Rathe "ATM" is accessible to any
character 30+ in a group, it's not the hugely unbalancing thing it
would be if, let's say, it required serious crowd control for most
players to pharm.  Oh wait, Old Seb is pretty popular too, isn't it.
