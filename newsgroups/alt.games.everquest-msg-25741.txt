You're under the impression it's not?  Everquest offers so much more of the
RP in RPG than Diablo 2 and yet, with the people I meet playing, there are
days when I can't tell the difference.  It's a shame so many people treat EQ
like it's a race to level 60, the best uber gear, and never mind anything
else.  I think the new Might & Magic (what is it, XXIV by now?) just came
out; if you want to achieve demipowerhood without the distraction of
interacting with other players, that's your game.
