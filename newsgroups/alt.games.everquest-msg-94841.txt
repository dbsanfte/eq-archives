Pain and suffering is the EQ terminology for saying you died slowly.  
Make a lvl 1 character and get in a fight.  While you are laying there 
unconsious (doesn't happen much at higher lvls).  Just before you die, 
you'll probably see a message similar to the following:  Pain and 
suffering overtake you.  RETURNING TO HOME POINT....PLEASE WAIT

And yes, it does sound like (since you said there weren't any mobs) that 
you "drowned".  Since the Grey is a vacuum, you'll die rather quickly 
without an EB item or spell.
