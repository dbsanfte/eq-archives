I'll give my thoughts as a betatester as well then. You *did* neglect
to mention it was still in beta until the very end.

Everyone has a different view of the graphics.

My own opinion? The world looks much better than EQ's, maybe its best
improvement. You can see so far away, mountains in the distance, etc.
It was hard to go back to EQ's terrain after that.

On the downside the characters in the game are *not* very good
looking.

To be more accurate only stuff way above your level wears out really
fast. Stuff way below your level just sucks.

That is inaccurate. There is an experience bonus that begins to build
on a timer after a mob spawns. Kill something that has been alive a
long time and you get a nice hunk of bonus experience. Kill something
that just spawned and you get no bonus experience. But the base
experience of a monster never changes, no matter how long you camp
for.

There are several other bonus experience modifiers on monsters too,
including monster group bonuses.

You did not mention your graphics card. 128mb is not very impressive
either.

You are the first person I've heard complain about that. I think your
system is to blame, not the game.

This is true *in first person*. DAoC was designed with *3rd person*
expected to be the default (it has a fully mobile camera). All the
motion graphics are there in third person.

I *wish* they were in first person, though, since thats how I prefer
to play.

It *is* only in beta and some kinks are still being worked out. Is it
better than EQ? For some people, because it really has some major
DIFFERENCES from EQ. 

They are pretty different. DAoC has the advantage of two and a half
years of advancing technology and experience.

I am thinking I will play both.
