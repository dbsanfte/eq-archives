Indeed.  It is inappropriate to shoot antiaircraft fire at a gunship,
even if you are with a wedding party.  The gunship will respond.

The fact is that large caliber antiaircraft fire came from the compound
as well as small arms fire.  The ordnace was not random, but was
directed at the aircraft.  It is unfortunate that combatants use
civilians as shields, but it is appropriate for a gunship to respond to
such fire.  

Note that over 15 tons of munitions, including antiaircraft weapons
were recovered near the site. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to 
condemn combatants who fire from behind civilians in such a way than it
is to condemn the gunship that responded appropriately to attack.  

This is a little like a similar thing that happened in Paktia on
29 Dec when the US bombed a munitions depot.  The Pentagon claimed
it bombed a munitions depot, and journalists found a large cache
of tank rounds, mortar shells, etc.  Villagers complained that
they had assembled around the munitions depot for a wedding.

Any killing of civilians is tragic.  It might be approprite, however,
for wedding parties to be held away from enemy munitions dumps and
antiaircraft sites.
