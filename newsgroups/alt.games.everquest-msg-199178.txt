The "porcupine" method has been an extremely successful method
of soloing for me.  A benefit of this approach is keeping skills
like Offense, Defense, Dodge, and weapon skills well trained.

So, in my opinion, druids *should* get in there and mix it up,
depending on their level and the mobs they're fighting, of course.
