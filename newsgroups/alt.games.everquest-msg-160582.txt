Online Game Economies Get Real  

By Jason Whiting 
02:00 AM Nov. 06, 2002 PT

In a galaxy not too far away, online gamers may soon scour the job
boards for paying posts as Galactic Empire insurgents or anti-Vader
moisture farmers. 

Massive multiplayer online games boast subscriber populations that
rival those of many North American cities. As a result, game
developers are moving beyond simply creating ultrarealistic 3-D
worlds. They're also modeling less tangible Earth phenomena such as
governance and commerce -- prompting a rise of real economies in
imaginary societies. 

"Traditionally that kind of kill-the-rat, get-your-five-gold-pieces
model hasn't changed with most (massive multiplayer online games),"
said LucasArts producer Haden Blackman, referring to the revenue
strategy pioneered by the early text-based multi-user domains on which
modern MMPORGs are based. "One of the things we wanted to do is have a
more viable player-run economy from the very outset." 

Blackman heads up the LucasArts branch of the team that's working with
Sony Online Entertainment to produce the first Star Wars-based MMPORG,
Star Wars Galaxies, set to hit shelves in late January. 

The elaborate handle for these online role-playing games is shortened
in various ways throughout the online gaming industry: MMOP, MMO and
MMPOG, in addition to the Star Wars Galaxies-styled, MMPORG. 

Typically, MMPORG gamers move through elaborate environments as
digital action figures called avatars. Successful adventures yield
monetary rewards that can be used to purchase equipment and clothing. 

The major problem with older MMPORG economies has been their
artificiality. The ability to sell to market-oblivious machines and
the presence of infinitely durable goods, for example, have led to a
variety of economic problems, which Blackman said his team is working
hard to minimize. 

"We identified some problems with the previous MMPORGs -- things like
the older a (gaming) server is, the more money is available, meaning
less value for 'ï¿½ber-items,'" Blackman said, referring to the
devaluation of currency that occurs when an economy lacks monetary
drains. "We wanted to avoid that syndrome if we could, and so a very
simple addition like 'item decay' in our game will hopefully help." 

And as similar games move closer to economic reality, the line between
"real" and "fake" economy begins to disappear. 

"From an economist's standpoint what's happening in these games is
real," said Edward Castronova, an associate professor of economics at
California State University at Fullerton. "You've got a distinct
territory with specialization of labor, gains from trade, a floating
exchange rate -- real economies are happening." 

As a doctorate student in economics, Castronova had a strictly
recreational interest in gaming -- until he encountered Sony Online's
EverQuest, the most massively popular MMPORG in history. 

"I started playing EverQuest in early 2001, and was playing for about
four days when I saw the reality of the economy in it," he said. 

A year later, Castronova had penned the first-ever study of a game
society's economic system. His paper examines the EverQuest world of
Norrath, where "the exchange rate between Norrath's currency and the
U.S. dollar is determined in a highly liquid (if illegal) currency
market, and its value exceeds that of the Japanese Yen and the Italian
Lira.... Norrath's GNP per capita easily exceeds that of dozens of
countries, including India and China." 

Star Wars Galaxies directly addresses many of the economic problems
Castronova identified in the Norrathian economy -- namely the
reduction of computer-controlled merchants and the elimination of
infinitely durable goods. Both of these measures should eliminate the
deflation experienced in Norrath. 

Castronova believes games will eventually move from the creation of
"real" economies to the formation of "real" governments. 

"What you have now is a customer service state -- history has shown
that this is not a viable way to run a people," he said. "I'm sure
that we'll see a move toward consensus-based decision making. You are
going to see player parliaments, or people are going to go to Earth
courts and sue."
