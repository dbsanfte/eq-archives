I HATE this last patch for what it's done to my screen, in EQ. Am I *really*
the only one whose screen showed up in a manner that was not only crazy, but
inefficient as well????? As far as I'm concerned, this patch SUCKS the big
one. It hasn't helped me. It's made my life in EQ, so far, more *miserable*
than it ever was. I type "I" for inventory, and I get this transparent
screen in the *middle* of my screen that has stats (which is nice) and bags
(not open, which are NOT), and if I want to add foraged food or water, I
have to -open- each bag and actually FIND where the fuck the stuff is
stacked, before I can add it to my list.


Who the hell thought up THIS nightmare????????????????
