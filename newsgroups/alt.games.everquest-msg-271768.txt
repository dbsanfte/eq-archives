Hi gang!

I have a P4 3.0 with 2 gigs of ram and a Radeon 9800 Pro 128 meg card.  I 
set everything for the high end system and it was way too laggy.  I lowered 
all the options to the mid-range system and I'm still getting tons of lag in 
the cities.  In the inn sometimes I can't move.  I didn't think I'd be 
having these problems with my system.

I'm open to any and all options to improve performance.

Thanks in advance!
