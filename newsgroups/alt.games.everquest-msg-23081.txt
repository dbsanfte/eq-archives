Ummm this response is so wrong after level 21 a Druid comes into his own as
a soloist and kiter. I have been soloing since level 21 and am now a 31.
Lake Omen is great for soloing or grouping if you want, then I went
toEverfrost and have been soloing Mammoths while the fighters need to group.
Druid  a fantastic class if you like to Solo and yes i solo Blues and Blacks
with little effort.
