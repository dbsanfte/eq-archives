Did you remember to re-install DirectX8 after you installed the new drivers,
I forgot to do that and had a ton of problems till I re-installed DX8. I'm
also running ME and have 640megs of RDRAM myself, no problems here. My
system will support 2gig of RDRAM but it would cost more than my entire
system to do that *lol*.
