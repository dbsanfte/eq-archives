As I recall it took two weeks. It never bugged me; I played after
midnight anyways.

But believe me that content problem was major. Were you playing when
every single frog in LG had someone camping it? Just people sitting in
one spot, camping a single frog, because that's all they could get for
experience. You could run from the dead side entrance to the ghoul
lord room to the froglok king room to the live side entrance and not
see a single unfought mob. The only alternative was SolB - just as
crowded - or guards in certain towns, and it took a while before
people started doing that. Kedge was unitemized and pathing was truly
bugged to hell. You couldn't do the planes (once they arrived) for
experience.
