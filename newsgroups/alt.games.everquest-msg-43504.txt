Yep, yep. I think that's exactly what I'm looking for, except for the
neck slot item. Next time you talk to Friedrich I could use a price
check on those.

See? I just don't see the attraction. What about 70 HP? For that much
money? I want AC and resists, but Hit Points I've got by the boatload.
Around 3K with shammy buffs stacked on me right now. What's another 70?
Seafuries hit for more than that in one shot. That much money would only
buy me another one second of life in a fight.
