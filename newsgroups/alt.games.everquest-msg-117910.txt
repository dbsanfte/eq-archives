They say that the Jaggedpine Forest zone "will be initially available only
on Stormhammer...."

By 'initially,' I take it that it will 'eventually' make it to the other
servers.  My understanding with the Pirate zone was that it was planned to
be Stormhammer only, so Jaggedpine will be different.

Even if it's a full year before Jaggedpine makes it to the other servers,
I'm very happy to hear they're finally creating that zone.  It's long
overdue.  The Qeynos/Halas area really needs a zone like that nearby.

I'm also glad to hear it'll have a town in there as well.  I'm a great fan
of exploring towns, and wish EQ had a few more of them.  And if they put a
wizzy spire there, then maybe the economies of the Qeynos/Halas areas might
pick up again....
