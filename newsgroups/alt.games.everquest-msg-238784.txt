From the perspective of someone who doesn't enjoy raiding, I think
they went too far with the difficulty in GoD, or more specifically,
the difficulty after a wipe for the group dungeons. 

Would the dungeon really have been that much easier if they didn't
have potential 1 or 2 hour CRs after a wipe? To me, that's just
incredibly silly game design when the difficulty comes from factors
beyond your control. Will the cleric's invis drop on a CR? will there
be a random see-invis mob in the way in Barundi? Assuming you make it
back to the instance, can you summon your corpse or get a rogue/monk
to drag them out? None of those are challenges that I enjoy in EQ, to
me they're nothing but worthless time sinks. 

Maybe it's just burnout on EQ in general and the fact that I usually
only have 3 hours of playing time at a stretch which makes the
instances pretty worthless for my playing style but there really isn't
anything in GoD that I've seen so far to hold my interest.
