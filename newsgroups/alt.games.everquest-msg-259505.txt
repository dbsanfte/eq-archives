Oh yeah, definitely. Those were the scenes that tugged at me. I laughed out 
loud at chessboard, god the memories hanging out there waiting for the 
spawns to pop and racing other players to them. Haha. Other old haunts that 
evoke those kinds of memories are Unrest, Najena, Mistmoore and of course 
CB. Although all my memories of those days are not positive, and I actually 
had a better time in my most recent return to the game with Winterfury, few 
things warm the heart like old memories and nostalgia ...
