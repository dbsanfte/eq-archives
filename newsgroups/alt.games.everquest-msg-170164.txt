Actually, works as in "I misread what you typed and thought you meant no
models on and no horses on."  :)  I've seen that pop up a few times, and my
magician uses no models and has horses turned off and has no problems at all
summoning a horse purely for the med-while-standing benefit.

If I had any models on, I'd have horses/elementals on.  Last night alone my
magician was a wood elf, gnome, troll and half elf due to a bored enchanter
in the group.
