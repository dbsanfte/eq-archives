Well, earlier in this thread someone said they go for 200p, :-) Although he may have been
confusing it with a Drakkel Forged Sledgehammer, (which I am thinking should go for 150p).

You have a while to wait for the proc, it still does not proc for my 45 Ranger, I handed it
to a 47 Pally and it would not proc for him, (but I could swear i was grouped with a high 40's
in KC who was procing it, and it was a but of a problem since it was knocking the mobs back
into the water, :-o).

Even without the proc it is a very nice weapon. Unfortunatly a cleric cannot use it.
