ok...just logged in, standing in front of giant fort in frontier
mountains and
i type /lfg on then shout "29th warrior LFG". a minute later someone
asks me if
i want to join their group. I say yes and ask loc or where. He says
he's at the
backdoor to the fort. hmm....thats odd....ive never been to the
backside of the
fort and i didnt know it had a backdoor so i wander around the
backside to see.
no backdoor there. then he sends tell asking me where i am cause hes
at the backdoor. i do a / and see he isnt in the zone. i ask him and
hes at the sarnak fort in LOIO at the backdoor. WTF? i never got
another reply from him. the next day the same thing happens with a
person in OT. they ask me to join their group after i ooc or shout LFG
message but they arent in the same zone. i wonder if somehow my shouts
and ooc bleed through into other zones or whether they just do a /who
all LFG or /who all warrior and dont bother to check that im in
frontier mountains and NOT in their current zone. i dont have anon or
role on. i ask the second guy how he came to ask me in paticular about
joining group....whether he heard my shout or whether he looked me up
via /who all . he wouldnt reply either......maybe felt like a dumbass.
if this is a bug i need to report it.....its its just morons then im
thankful i didnt group with them (tends to get you killed)
