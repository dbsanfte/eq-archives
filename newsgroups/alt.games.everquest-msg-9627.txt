Happily and gladly. I can play this ping-pong game for years and
years. I'm inordinately more intelligent than you, plus I have the
advantage of being in the right. 

Keep going, Ronnie boyo... I'm running on Duracells and you're running
on borrowed time. 18 years left to achieve something. You going to go
do it or are you still stuck infront of your PC whacking off and
waiting for the next post?

To answer your "point"... you've used aliases (and its more than 3)
over a long period of time. I've changed posting name and email
address over the course of the evening to circumvent kill-filters, cos
ya know what Ronnie-boyo? I'd rather like your comprades to read all
of this shit. It reflects badly on me, cos I'm lowering myself to your
incontinent level... but it reflects a whole lot fucking worse on you.

It's also all being archived for somewhere down the line when you
*really* choose someone as sociopathic as yourself to abuse.
