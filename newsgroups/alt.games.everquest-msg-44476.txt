I've heard good and bad.  My bosses wife plays EQ and she is in the DAoC beta
and I got some feedback from her (most of the questions I posted last week were
sparked by the conversation with her).

I've heard that it is very stable, but I've also heard it is laggy due to beta
bandwidth constraints.

I've seen the graphics, and they'll do.  I doubt the landscapes will look as
good as AO.

Downtime is much less and there are travel enhancements coming according to the
web page.  These are important after the sitzkrieg called EQ.

I don't believe any good press about a game developer until the game is
launched and I can see how they work under fire and how they react to problems.
 I doubt it could be worse than Funcom.  Well, it could, but they'd have to
spontaneously explode to manage it.

Anything a dev says prior to release is basically a blow job for the players
and meaningless.  This doesn't mean they aren't sincere, but you don't really
know if they are any good until the game is live.

I'm going to try DAoC but my expectations are not that high.  All I want it to
be is an EQ clone that suits my tastes better than EQ does, and it appears to
be that.   Time will tell.

I won't be there opening day, that is for sure.  I did that with WWIIOL and AO
and learned my lesson.  For now.
