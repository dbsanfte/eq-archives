At low levels regen helps, at high levels and with a decent group it means
nothing.  I guess this is me thinking trying to get from level 57 to 58 and
figuring it  takes 100 hours of fighting.  I'd rather have it take 90 hours.
; )  Would you rather have iksar regen at level 52 or two extra levels?

I agree having fun is everything.  For me having fun is exploring new
places, getting new stuff, fighting new mobs, getting new spells /
abilities.  That happens more often when you're gaining levels.
