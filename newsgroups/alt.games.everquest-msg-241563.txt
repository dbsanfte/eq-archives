   Hi Scott.  I can say I'll try, but I can pretty much guarantee that I won't
remember this when I get in game.  I sometimes even forget to say hi to my
guild.  You can send a tell to me, of course, or join age.chat where you are
pretty much guaranteed to hear me blurt out something amusingly inappropriate
sooner or later.
