I'm just curious - recently, I've noticed a lot
of pallies running around in-game and an increase
in questions about them here.

Has something changed in-game to make them a more
desireable class to play?  Last time I checked,
people did not like pallies (this was a long time
ago that I looked into them) and I'm guessing
that something has made them more interesting to
play (damage tables, healing increases, etc.)

Can someone give a quick explanation on why the
pallies are getting more use these days?

Thanks,
Mike
