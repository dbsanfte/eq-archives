Just looked up the Ogre starting stats.  Put 5 points into dex to get to 75.
That leaves you with 20 points.  The rest of your physical stats are already
at the minimum recommended levels (and then some), 100+ in stamina, 75+ in
the others.  You might even consider putting some in charisma, get yourself
better vendor prices.  OK, that will still mean only a 57 charisma, but it's
better than 37.  From all the reading I have done, what I have found is that
once you have your stats at the recommended minimums, it doesn't matter much
what you do with the rest of the points.  Some people say stamina, but 20
points in stamina will mean 120 extra hp at level 60.  That's really not
very much at level 60.  Adding to STR will marginally increase your damage.
Adding to you AGI will marginally increase AC.  Adding to DEX will increase
the proc rate on weapons, and increase your liklihood of hitting with
archery (I think).  INT and WIS, well, you're an Ogre, what do you expect,
your rate of learning tradeskills in general will suck (with some
exceptions, smithing comes to mind).
