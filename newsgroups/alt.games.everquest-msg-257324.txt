My 65 enchanter friend told me his gem line-up.  He added that,
judging from discussions on the enchanter boards, his is fairly
typical.

<forwarded text follows>

Here's why I'd like an additional slot--some of the very useful enc spells 
take a long time to recycle, so you can't swap them in and out.  There are 
a number of spells that help efficiency for any particular thing you do, 
and some spells you need when things go bad.  You wind up balancing them 
off in your spell slots, and there is always something else you want at 
some point.

Example:  In a usual LDON lineup, I'll have tash, mez, slow, PBAE mez, rune 
pretty much always on.  If the group is killing quickly, I'll have NDT (a 
great melee buff, but takes a minute to recycle) and Scryer's trespass 
(gives 500 mana for a cost of 5 mana, recast every 3 min or so--equivalent 
of an extra FT 16 or so, makes us the 3rd best mana regenners in the 
game).  The last open slot is used to cycle through buffs as they are 
needed, or if all the buffs are fresh, I put a nuke in it.

That works great as long as everyone is working well.  If, though, someone
dot's a mob I've mezzed, it comes for me and I don't have a root or a blur
to get rid of it.  (The only thing I can do is mez and hope the blur
component in the mez works, which is terribly mana inefficient.  Blurs
don't mem fast.)  If the group is working too well (charge into each new
room, agro all 6, let the chanter sort them out) I need the other mana
drain spell (Theft of Thought) to keep up with the mana flow.  And it would
be nice to load the PBAE stun spell, there are a number of cases I can use
that and not distract the pets.  (On a mez the pets stop attacking, so if I
have to use that for crowd control it annoys all the pet casters.)

I get requests for other illusions.  They at least mem fast relative to 
their duration, so I can usually put them in my swap spot.  Sometimes I 
need a dispel (enchanter have the best dispel).  In other groups I've had 
to use my componentless rune (where we had a really bad cleric); heck, once 
in a while I even use my damage shield when there are no other ds 
casters.  Mostly for the surprise value, I admit.

In an LDON, mostly my extra slot would either be the stun or the root.
