Yeah, I think that the whole silly argument of "with or without malachite" 
or "with or without bone chips" is pointless. I understood the original 
question as being along the lines of "which class would be least screwed if 
all equipment were wiped out, due to a bug or server transfer".  

And I think that the answer is, basically, all casters are okey, with the 
possible exception of clerics, who need high AC too, and all melees are 
pretty much screwed, with the exception of monx. Not sure where bards stand 
here, really.
