The spell *is* broken.  The top end mobs had to be balanced
around the existence of it.  Pre-Kunark, it wasn't that
broken, however.  Back then 2k hp was common.  Land
the heal at 2 bubs (800hp) and you get 1200hp for 400 mana,
3:1 ratio.

Taking it out now would require completely rebalancing
*every* top end encounter.  It's too late for that.  As
a mage, I still agree that faster CH's break a already
broken spell.  I just wish the change had been more 
surgical.  I excludes spells that aren't cast in the heat
of battle, but which were nice to have sped up (arch shielding
anyone - why does that spell have a 12 second cast time?).
