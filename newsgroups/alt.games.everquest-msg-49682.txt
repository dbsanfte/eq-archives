Well, all I have at this point is conjecture because I haven't actually
gotten to try the PvP in DAoC yet.  You have to be fairly high level before
engaging in it.  But I have just finished a 6 hour playing session with the
game and I am exhillerated, and I can say that if Mythic has put the
attention and care into that aspect of the game as they seem to have
everything else, it will probably be well done and rewarding.

As for the actual mechanics of PvP (or RvR as they refer to it in DAoC) I
can tell you how they supposedly work and how they, in theory, are an
improvement over any other PvP attempt thus far:

In DAoC, an enemy player in PvP is very much like a mob.  You can't
communicate with them (you can never speak the same language), and they con
the same way.

You can't loot or be looted and you don't loose any exp from dying in PvP.
You might then ask what the point is.  You see, in DAoC, PvP combat is
rather like a seperate game.  It's sort of like a team based strategy game.
The objective is to capture certain strategic points in the PvP zones.  When
you do then everybody in your realm receives bonuses, like stat bonuses and
such, even the people back home fighting mobs.  If you don't like PvP and
don't want to participate in it, you don't ever have to.  It's an interesing
approach and I hope it comes off well.

Soon (after I get a little more experience with the game) I will write an
objective post on DAoC with comparisons to EQ and post it in this newsgroup
to help the EQ players here decide whether or not they want to give DAoC a
try.

Best Regards
