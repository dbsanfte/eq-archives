Is it just me, or do all the old rules about group and raid fighting
styles pretty much go out the window on the Moon?  I'm not saying that
there aren't lots of places where you can single pull mobs, even high
level ones, and fight them.... there are.  But it seems that a lot of
the big encounters and *particularly* the quests, are no longer things
where <one> big mob must be faced down by a big tank with clerical
healing support, and then swamped by the rest of the party while the
tank holds aggro.

Ring of Fire is certainly one example on a raid size scale. But last
night I was enlisted to help a couple of our druids finish the Shield of
Bane Warding quest. The portion of the quest with the cat Courriour
spawns EIGHT freaking undead at one time, all agressive, all fairly
tough, and you have to kill them all to collect their skulls.  The next
portion in GF causes some insane Grimling and FOUR more undead to all
spawn at once. 

I dont' know about you, but I can NOT rapidly gain aggro (and keep it)
on that many mobs while keeping the cleric breathing and kill them all.
One of the druids died three times during this fucking fiasco. As you
can well imagine, I feel rather inadequate as a tank if my casters are
dropping like flies.

I keep hearing people talking about AOE fighting, which for us was
formerly nothing more than a novelty in rare encounter situations. We've
only got two post fifty wizards in our guild, and while they are really
great, strategy-wise they are usually just the determining factor in who
is the KS group on Kael raids. Heh. (Oh, and porting to the planes, of
course.)

So what is it with fighting on Luclin. Are we going to just have to
powerlevel up a team of six Wizards to the mid fifties and carry them
where ever we go to just AOE nuke the shit out of everything we fight?
And what is a tank's place in this? Or am I now just an antiquated relic
to be hung out on the back line until somebody wants to go fight in the
old world?
