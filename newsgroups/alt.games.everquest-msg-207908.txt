I usually prefer Bih Li to wolfform.  It isn't as fast, it doesn't
give me ultravision, and the ATK boost is smaller.  OTOH, it zones
(and succors) with me, it doesn't make me KOS to a whole mess of
otherwise indifferent/apprehensive NPCs, the ATK boost doesn't matter
much to me as a Druid, and it gets maintained by some caster other
than myself.  OTGH, if ever I finish the Charm of Brotherhood quest
I'll likely be trying to convince every group I am with to let me
turn them all into puppies (did it for a Monk in the group the other
day and he was very pleased with the result).
