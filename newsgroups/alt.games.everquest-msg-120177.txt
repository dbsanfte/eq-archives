What I did was head to the OT zone in kunark, great place for druids.
Start on eastern side near statue and WW zone. Good kiting area, no
Goons, close zone for those times when running is indeed a plan. Also
good chance of making some very nice plat porting those that want out
NOW. Bind close to WW for easy return. Good till 40 or till you want
to quad.
