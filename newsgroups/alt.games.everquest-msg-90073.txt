I figured I would do a search and find out what is actually made with HQ
Lion Skins. I figured if I could get a good idea of the value of the end
product I could figure the value of the ingredients. Well I came across the
Fleeting Quiver. http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6186

Seems that is sells for around the 4K range. I checked this against EQPrices
and it was similar. My question is why is this worth so much? Yes it has 60%
weight reduction but are arrows really all that heavy? And 6 slots are
better than the 4 slots in my quiver. But I only paid a plat or two for
mine. I don't really see why it's worth so much. Is it an ego thing? High
level characters don't want to be running around with the same crappy quiver
that low levels have? =) They got to have the deluxe model? =)
