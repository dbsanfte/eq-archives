UGH!  Thank you so much... this has been a peeve of mine and my husband's
for a while.
One night, while sitting in Nro camping Dorn B'dynn for that stupid dragoon
dirk, we got invite after invite from this ONE guild... probably every five
minutes.  Finally, everybody started shouting "KNOCK OFF THE GUILD
SPAMMING!!" and he got all pissy saying oh blah blah, this is how I recruit.

He must have a guild full of morons...
