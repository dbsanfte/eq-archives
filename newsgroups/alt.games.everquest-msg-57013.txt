*shrug* I've been posting to this newsgroup a LOT, under the same email
address for over 18 months.  Maybe you're getting the spam from a different
source.

BTW, I don't know where the hell my head is, but it's not 15-20 junks a
week, it's more like 5-10 a day.  Still what I consider to be in the
"NOTHING" category compared to what I used to get on AOL as soon as I
visited any chat room. :)
