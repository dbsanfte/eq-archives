    Oh, I forgot one more thing. The quest you have to do for the
Grandmaster's Seal so you can make this junk involves making a bunch of
poisons, and turning them in. It nets you about 4% of an AA or so when you
do it. And you can repeat it as many times as you have poisons available,
the limit being the drop-only stuff. I think I worked it out that two people
grouped would cost 2000 pp in storebought stuff per AA point for the both of
them, so you're looking at about 30 pp per hand-in. It's a nice plus once
you get to the elemental planes and start swimming in poison components.
