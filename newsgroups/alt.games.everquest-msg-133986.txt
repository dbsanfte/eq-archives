Bah!... you young people of today...

The correspondences to look for are partly
astrological, partly alchemical and partly
Qabalistic.

Qabalistically, In the GD sytem of correspondences
of the paths on the Tree of Life the path of the
Magician (Beth) is number 11. This path connects
Kether to Binah and is coloured yellow.

Astrologically, the Magician is assigned to
Mercury (Hermes, Thoth), and under certain
circumstances too complex to go into here,
corresponds to the colour yellow.

Alchemically, Mercury as the morning star is the
Light Bringer, bringing light (wisdom), from the
Sun. As Waite says in his description of the card
he says of the Magician "having the countenance of
divine Apollo". This light is the yellow sky and
ground in the card.

The problem with re-colouring the card is that the
path of the Fool on the Tree, is coloured a
different shade of yellow.

The cards are described, but not pictured, in Book
T, in Israel Regardie's enormous book, The Golden
Dawn. I have never seen an original set.

The one I was referring to was created by Robert
Wang, purely from the descriptions in Book T, I
believe.

The Tarot doesn't demand that you pick it up. If
someone doesn't like the look of it, perhaps they
had best leave it alone.

I do remember hearing that that deck was a way of
getting around some copyright problems, but I am
not sure if it is true or not.
