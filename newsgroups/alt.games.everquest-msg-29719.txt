About all I can recommend is the Cured Tizmak Tunic for a
slightly different leather look.  I suppose you could try to
get out to skyshrine and see if someone would let you loot a
guardian robe, but it will still have your basic tunic look,
but be purple. They are no drop, but its a 40+ zone, and a
rare drop, so all I can say is Good Luck if you try.
