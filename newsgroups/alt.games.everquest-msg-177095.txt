About 4-5 months ago my guild was doing Ssra, and I went LD at the water
elevator thing, and my guild sat there waiting for me because they are cool
people (plus I was transport to get out)  So I logged on EQIM, joined the
raid channel and explained that I couldn't get back into EQ because of a
1018, they told me to try again, and I did, about 20 times.

So here I am sitting looking at this 1018 message for about 30 mins, and I
sent a tell to a good friend in game (was in the guild) to log on
Woodknight, get everybody out of there, and then log back on his mule
character.  So he did that, and while he was doing that, with the help of
EQWindow, he changed the information on my account, without me knowing, and
about a month later, he quit.

I changed my password as soon as he was done, and I never need to check the
EQ website for my info, so I didn't.  Then he went to the EQ site and did a
password recovery, logged on my characters, and stripped them all...

I went to go play EQ when my password didn't work, and I tried my old one
that I had a couple months earlier and it worked..?   So I went on and found
all my characters basically naked.  I didn't relay this info to you all
because I honestly was so steaming mad at the time I just wanted to express
my anger and quit...

Well, I've petitioned this info (told to me by the thief's RL friend) and
hope to get a response today (petitioned this morning)

Thanks for all the support and ideas. )
