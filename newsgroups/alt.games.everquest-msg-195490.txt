If you have just one account with multiple characters, then you will have 
to either find a person you can trust to give the items to, in order for 
him to then give them to your alternate character.  Alternatively, you can 
find an out of the way spot somewhere, bring both of your charcters there, 
make sure there are no mobs that path nearby, then drop the equipment on 
the ground, right before you finish camping, log in your other character, 
and hope the stuff is still there.  Another way is to find a tradeskill 
container that is unused, in some way out of the way place, and put the 
items inside it, and, again, switch characters, and take the items out of 
it.
