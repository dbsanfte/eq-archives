We ran into a lot of the same issues in my guild too.  Flagging became a 
big issue, and ultimately caused a split in the guild.  It certainly did 
nothing to build cohesion in the guild.  Some might say the guild was bound 
to split at some point anyway, if that issue is what caused it, perhaps 
true, but, the flagging issue certainly was not a help.
