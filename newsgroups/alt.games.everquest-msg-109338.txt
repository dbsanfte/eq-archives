Not necessarily. Whether a civilization survives or not has very little 
to do with its military prowess. The Mongols invaded China in many 
occasions, and in each one of them they were assimilated in, as China had 
the stronger civilization. Japan was utterly defeated in WWII, and yet 
its civilization thrives, and has permeated the West as much as the West 
has permeated Japan. What makes civilizations strong are their memes, and 
the memes of the West (freedom, wealth, pleasure), are just about 
unbeatable, no matter what you throw at them.
