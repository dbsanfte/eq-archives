Actually, since i did not spammed, but only post for once one topic that
wasnt related to EQ.
If anybody website relied on what people say or mention about them, we would
be in trouble.

The site is not mine and im pretty sure whatever he does doesnt rely on EQ
fan only or users subscribed to this newsgroup.
Damage? that is your oppinion, but we both know that no damage was done and
i just stumbled on a EQ user just like me
who had a bad hair day.

If someone says, yahoo is trying to beat the world record for the most
visitors in a day, and that person post this message here or in another
newsgroup or forum. I dont think that this would cause damage to Yahoo Inc.
Just because the person who  posted the message got Flamed or stuck
with a unhappy user.

The internet is not that fragile, and ISP just dont pull the plug because
someone says so and is having a bad day.
They have access to logs , data etc... Im pretty sure Dark Jedi did call, My
ISP probably did nothing, and if they did, they would have
run a check on me and what have gone out from my mailing account. And
probably told Dark Jedi or Whoever the arsh truth. I was not
spamming.

But this comes back to, some feels bitchy and some dont. Nobody forces
anything.
I have been posting here for months under different account and Nickname and
got my first flame, so my ratio is good.

Like i said if someone wants to annoy a newsgroup in particular, there is
nothing you can do unless that person breaks the Law
I dont think i have to prove my point here. We all saw it if some of you
browse others newsgroups.

The best solution its to always read what you want, that is one utility of
newsgroup. Even if i would see a post on how to change a diaper
on EQ newsgroup, you think im gonna bother read it, unless i need to know
that information?

If the user got nothing to do and feels like Flaming, well nothing prevents
him from doing so, hell! the user can complained and do whatever he wants,
it keeps him occupy, gives some Gossip to reads for others, and those who
knows what they are looking for , pass on.

Take care bud.

I saw that initial post as a nice experiment related to moods and perception
:-)

And remember if i wanted to spam, which it wasnt the case, i could do it
using my brain and my 4 networks card,
uninstall, reinstall another Network card, and there you go , a brand new
IP. So if someone is smart, He can just prepared his
spam campaign using whatever warez he wants , covers his trace using again
whatever warez or hack trick he wants, and on top of that
switch Network card at the end . If i want to spam , i would go through all
that trouble. Rest assure, i got betters thing to do, I like EQ
but its not the only thing in my life. If my character dies, i wont cry,
life is wonderful, EQ is a game and newsgroup are newsgroup.

Love all
