I'm doing it with 3 PCs.

You just need a Broadband Cable/DSL Router. Linksys makes a nice 4
port model for about 115$ US. (If you already have a hub, you can buy
a 1 port version). The Cable Modem feeds the IP address to the Router,
and the Router assigns IP addresses to each PC. Took about 5 minutes
to setup. No special settings were required for EQ.
