Actually, Imbued Plains Pebbles make excellent gold earrings for Karana
followers.  They are -3str, +2sta, +4wis each.  Most enchanters will only
charge you for the gold to make these.  They seem to get very excited about
doing Deity items.  I havent quite figured out why, but I got some 6 pairs
made for only 120p.  I ended up with one pair too many & managed to sell the
pair for 75p.  The Deity armor is shitty, shitty, shitty.  The tailoring
skill required to make these armor pieces is, IMO, way too high.  The armor
pieces are each only 1 or 2 wis & poor ac to boot.  There is a Deity basher
for Karana, too, but it is pretty crappy.  You can easily get a better 1hb
weapon.  Further, I was not impressed by Imbued Plains Pebbles combined with
any other enchanted metal.  Gold seems to be the best.  The other equipment
created with other enchanted metals is surpassed by the wisdom gear commonly
acquired by druids.

Go here:  http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_tailoring_halfling.htm
to check out the Karana armor.
Go here:  http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_wood_elf.htm to
check out the Karana weapons.

A note about the weapons is that while it SAYS Fier'Dal (Wood Elf), it can
be created with Imbued Plains Pebbles instead, which makes it Karana only
instead of Tunare only (Imbued Emerald).

Go here:  http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm to
check out the various Deity specific gems & the stats they grant.

A note about the jewelcraft, which I probably shouldnt even mention as it
should be assumed, is that you still have to have enchanted metal with the
imbued gem in order to make these things.

As for the spell, Imbue Plains Pebble, I *think* that all druids get that.
I am not certain of this as I am a halfling druid &, therefore, worship
Karana.  However, wood elves must worship Tunare, from what little checking
I have done.  I know that clerics can imbue emeralds.

Anyway, I have personally supplied all the halfling druids in my guild with
Karana earrings, at no cost to them.  I like the Karana earrings better than
Forest Loops, personally.  However, I am not overly concerned about +AC
since things are either running from me, too low to really threaten me or
more concerned about the friendly warrior introducing it to his Wurmslayer.
I dont see any reason to spend 300p for +3wis when I can spend, at worst,
40p for +8wis (2 earrings at +4wis each).  Up to you, in the end.

As for selling the pebbles themselves, there isnt a big market for them.  I
have paid for some & I paid 3p per pebble.  It is rumored, & I am sure there
will be plenty of debunkers that will post after me now, that plains pebbles
reduce the amount you drink by 50% - while Imbued Plains Pebbles reduce the
amount you eat *&* drink by 50%.  I have put absolutely no effort into
trying to verify this.  Although, since I am currently carrying 30 of them
around with me, I will say that it *seems* to be true, but a foraging druid
is food factory anyway.

Hope this all helps.
