Are you wanting to run 2 monitors at the same time, so you'd have one *big*
desktop in windows?

If so, then you don't need to have an expensive card, just one that will
support the monitor and what ever it is you want to do on that second
display. You'll need atleast windows 98 for multiple monitor support.

IMHO, if you plan to have the other active so you can do things while in EQ
then remember that EQ is a memory hog, so you'd be able to do little CPU or
Internet intensive.

Are these some of the things you'd like to do?
