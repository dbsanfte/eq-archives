   There are sixty odd references to it google, and several in yahoo as
well.  But while I can tell from the context that it probably means
something nasty, I could not gleam a definition.  Merriam Websters and the
like asked me if perhaps I didn't mean something else, predictably enough.

   I've asked on alt.tasteless.  If anyone knows, they will.  Will report
back tomorrow.
