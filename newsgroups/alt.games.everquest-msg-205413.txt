Note that the key to your analysis is the target number out of the range;
the lower the number the more "fair" the game is.

Target number changes those odds substantially.

500 out of 1000 would be even odds.

600 out of 1000 would be better odds than your analysis, but still would
suck.

400 out of 1000 would actually be -better- odds than even.

Even with unfair odds, its possible to win money on a casino, by
controlling when you leave.  Simply play until you are ahead, which
statistically is nearly certain to happen eventually (although it will on
average take longer and longer the worse the odds).  When you are ahead,
stop betting.  You lose with this system only if you run out of money (or
willingness to keep throwing money away) before you get ahead.

Big casinos normally win, not just because they have odds slightly in
their favor, but because gamblers have far shallower pockets than they do,
they either run broke, or quit while they are behind (run out of
willingness to spend).

They also win because quitting while you are ahead is very difficult.  You
always feel you can get even further ahead, and you are only risking your
winnings anyway.  So gamblers who are winning tend to throw the money back
into the hole, while gamblers who are losing tend to either stop or run
out of money and be forced to stop.

This doesn't address the other way casino's win.  Your analysis assumes an
honest game.  But what if I put up a casino run like a roulette wheel,
offering to pay 10000pp for a 1pp bet, and all you have to do is get 999
on a 1 to 1000 roll?  Well, most people will lose, and I'll collect
collect collect.  Then eventually someone wins.. and I log out and discard
the character, who is a level one I made on a free trial account, and who
will never be seen again.  In the meantime, I've been giving all the cash
I collect to my real character, who is standing there in the crowd looking
just like the other suckers.  This means that while offering 10 to 1 in
your favor, the house is actually running 100% against you!
