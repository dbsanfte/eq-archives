I'm doing the DE SK newbie armor quest.All that is left is the leggings.I
need 2 calcified pelvis bones.I've been killing skellies of all types
(except decaying).I've found enough bones top make the whole suit sans
leggings twice or three times, yet have seen not a single pelvis.Anyone have
a good location?Or is it just back to Nektulos for me and hours or days more
killing mobs that I don't get EP from?
Any help would be appreciated.Thanks.
