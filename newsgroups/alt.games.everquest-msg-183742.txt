I got the 9500 pro a little while ago with my brand new system-to make
a long story short-i started with a 300w, various troubles, 370,
various troubles-corrected 1 problem that had nothing to do with power
+ 470 power (and top recommended manufactor of pw)-all is well!!! and
lovely and stable!!!!-due to other issues I cant 100% gaurentee the pw
upgrade fixed everything, but all my research pointed in that
direction and I'm a happy dwarf :)   - Ironeyes, 52 clr-rathe
