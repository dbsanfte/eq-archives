My favorite pet, all things being equal, is the air pet; it does
decent damage, avoids getting hit fairly well, and does something
near and dear to my old cleric'ly heart - it stuns.  Stuns
interrupt casters and effectively slow the mobs down while adding
hate nicely; air pets are the mage version of a paladin.

But they do something else, that used to be fantastic, and is now
merely annoying at best, sometimes More than annoying.

They invis themselves whenever they get bored.

Once upon a time, pets were basically the same faction as their
owner, so they could get aggro.  And since they were lower level
than their owner, they could get a lot of aggro in places where
he wouldn't.  Level thing aside, they path like mobs, so they
don't do a good job of keeping out of range of mobs you might be
trying to duck out under or past.

But thats been patched into a non problem long since, pets are
all now nuetral faction, so they don't get into trouble unless
they are on the hate list of something for attacking him or
someone he likes.

Since all invis does is make you neutral in this same way to mobs
that can't see invis, this is redundant at best.

But since mages "power up" their pets by handing them summoned
(or looted or bought or made) items, its annoying to have them
vanish while you are still trying to gear them up.

How is it "more than annoying" though?  Well, sometimes you need
a pet to stop fighting something.  So you tell him to back off,
and he moves away from the mob back to you or to his sit/guard
spot like a good dog.  With Expedience (pet only SOW type spell)
most pets can get out of range of a mob with only a try or two. 
But often the Air pet stops in the middle of running away to
Invis himself, and gets swatted for his trouble!

It would be nice if they could think of something creative for
him to cast instead... but barring that, how about just turning
off the invis thing altogether?
