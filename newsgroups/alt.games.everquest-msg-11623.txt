Hi everyone.
I started hunting these last night, and killed about
5 or so before I had to log.  Pretty nice xp, but the
only thing they dropped was Essence of Rathe.

Do these things drop anything else, and what is
Essence of Rathe for?  I tried looking it up on a few
sites but came up empty.

Thanks in advance.
