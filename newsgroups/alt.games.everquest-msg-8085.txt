It probably has something to do with the widening of the strenghts of
classes as they lvl. For instance, a lvl 30 druid is going to much more
easily solo a creature than a warrior of equal lvl would. So, the "less
risky" or "looks dangerous" applies less and less since the capabilities
vary so much at that lvl.
