Hmmm....no one on Infinity, which is where I am (Adaael, level 10 Mind
Control/Empathy Controller, and The Black Terror, level 8 something/War Mace
Tanker).

I've noticed that my Controller is not making much use of Empathy (other
than the first AoE heal, everything else I've taken has been from Mind
Control, plus Hovering from Flight), so I've been thinking of trying a
Controller with Mind Control/Something-other-than-empathy.  Maybe I'll make
that one on Protector and join the crowd. :-)
