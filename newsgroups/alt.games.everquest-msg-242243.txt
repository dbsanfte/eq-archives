Maybe its changed, but at lower levels I had to run all over the
freaking place to find the new rez spells. Not the old level 49
type ones, but the new 'one rez every level, and 2 on sundays' type
ones.

I had to travel to luclin, freeport, rivervale... Many people I
asked simply shrugged at me or gave me information that was horribly
incorrect.

Now, my main was never a cleric, so I might have been missing
something, but I can easily see how a true newbie on their first
character might have missed it. Think how easy it is to get to
twenties nowadays - ripping into him is just being an asshole.

In fact, thinking further about this, I was grouped with a druid
who hadnt bought snare with my cleric once (in Paludal, low level,
clearly). I gated, bought them for them, and ran back. They were
very grateful and friendly.

No need to be bitchy about it at level 20, really.

Matt
