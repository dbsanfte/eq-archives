I would just suggest asking the cleric to bring your corpse near the 
zone, then rez you, if no one can eb you there (shouldn't be the case), 
just zone out and wait for your rez effects to leave, then zone back in 
and loot your corpse (unless you can move with rez effects and all your 
gear on). But I really doubt no one can cast eb on you, because everyone 
needs eb there, so the cleric too :)
