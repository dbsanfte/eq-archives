Who you calling a whiner? Moi? Pffftt... My previous message should not be
held against me since in this instance I was bringing new and much valued
information to AGE. =)

You might want to help all the poor fools still running Win95 by showing us
all where the win95->98 upgrade can be bought for $10.

IMO anyone who still uses Windows 95 deserves all the shit they get.
Actually anyone who uses ANY version of Windows deserves all the shit they
get. God damn its an aweful operating system. Ahhh the stories I could tell.

The only reason I have windows installed is so I can play EQ.
I could mention that fact that AO said they would release a Linux client but
after playing their game a few weeks and seeing how badly it ran I gave up
the Linux client as a pipe dream and drug induced rantings from their
developers.
