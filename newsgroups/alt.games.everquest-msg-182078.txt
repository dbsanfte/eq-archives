When my druid and enchanter were both 60, my druid could solo for xp much
faster (why would a 60 chanter solo for xp anyway? sheesh), yet my 60
chanter could solo in places indoor easily, where my druid would get eaten
(lower guk is an example). With lvl 55 pet, slow, haste and mez, you can
slowly work your way though most dungeons with mobs up to about lvl 50. I
would rate enchanters as being the best (or close to) indoor soloers.
