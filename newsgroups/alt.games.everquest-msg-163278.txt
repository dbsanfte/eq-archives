Well, it took some practice to get decent at this, but its doable, took me about
half a bar of mana in heals per kill, so there was some sitting around involved.

After some experimentation, I used WoT to split, MoR to pull, cast pet and then went
toe to toe while bashing away, keeping YV up, and occaisionally slapping a SR on
myself.

Something I didn't try was leaving out the pet, so I could root, back off, and CHeal
instead of using SRs.  Sometime soon I need to turn pet hits on and take a look at
the parse to see how much damage he's putting out.  I'm afraid its simply an
emotional attachment to the little guy that keeps me casting him, and keeping him
alive when I can.

Ten mobs in, I got a ring to drop, so I guess I won't be experimenting on them much.
