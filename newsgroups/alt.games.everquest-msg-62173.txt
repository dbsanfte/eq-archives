I have been running the Dx8 engine the past few days
and only had a couple issues with it, the fonts were too big
and they lines inside the party/group bow were flickering and
drawing outside the box across the screen. No big deal so
I sent in a bug report.

Now with the latest download I can't even play it! The graphics are
so screwed up its hard to describe. The 3d view shows major texture
bleeding and tearing. I am using a Geforce2 Mx400 64mb board, latest
drivers and Dx8. I think they are going to have to be busting their asses
at Verant to fix this before launch.  To top it off the fonts are <still>
too big!

Anyone else have this?
