If you haven't killed dervs, you get to sell to Murissa Sandwhisper.
My druid has killed a ton of dervs and can do business with the Oasis
gypsies with ease.

>Madmen are all indifferent to my necro.  

They all hate my shadow knight. She gets blasted more than my druid
ever did (my others haven't been exposed to the problem of raving
lunatics yet).

If your necro is an erudite, I'm tempted to say something about the
origins of madmen and Jonah (all the books finally went to their
heads?) :p
