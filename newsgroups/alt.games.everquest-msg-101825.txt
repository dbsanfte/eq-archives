Question: So you use the Luclin Graphics? I have a friend with an eMachines
Celeron 500, and he won't buy luclin because he knows it won't run on his
machine. He doesn't have the cash to buy a new system, so he never gets to
see the Luclin expansion's sweeeet new graphics or zones. With a Ram upgrade
(He has 192) and a new vid card (unfortunately would have to be PCI), would
he be able to get Luclin running at a decent, playable, framerate?

Thanks!
