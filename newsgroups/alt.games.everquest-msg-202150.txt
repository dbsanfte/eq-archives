Not aware of any FT items that are reasonably atainable by a level 23 and 
would work at level 23.  Meditate skill is what determines how fast you 
regain mana while sitting, your stats have no effect on that.  In addition, 
once you are high enough level, you can use AA points to add some 
additional mana regen.  You already know about FT items.  Enchanter, 
Beastlord, and Druid mana regen spells can add to your mana regen rate, 
and, all 3 stack.  Grouping with a bard can help, as they get a mana and/or 
health regen song that also stacks with the three spells.  Necros can give 
you some of their mana.  That's about all I can come up with off hand.
