So, isn't the "High-minded story fluff" in the manual EXACTLY what you
were looking for?

If what you actually want is for people to tell you exactly which
factions are good and bad for which classes and races and which mobs
to kill for those factions and alll the quests to do in Luclin for
phat lewt from those factions, you might as well just have said so up
front instead of trying to pass yourself off as a roleplayer and then
showing yourself to be a spoiled, lazy, ungrateful moron when you
weren't spoon fed the information off a silver platter.

(And, now I see you're actually proving me right in the other thread
you felt it was necessary to make...)
