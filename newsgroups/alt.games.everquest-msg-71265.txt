The really sad truth is Dennis, even if DAoC had more content then EQ,
even if it had a leveling curve that was perfect, you would find a
reason to dismiss it without ever trying it just because it includes
an RvR based endgame. 

DAoC has about the same amount of content that EQ had when it was
released.  Unfortunately we have all had our expectations raised. The
gameplay is very similar to EQ's UNTIL you can RvR, with less to do
while getting there. The content is split between three realms also
which further reduces the total.  

Mythic has said it is not going to try to usurp Verants PvE Epic
encounter type crown, and is instead aiming for rvr generated content.
What's weird is they seem to be doing everything they can to make that
RvR content = large scale keep taking, instead of all types of RvR
including small scale running battles, sneak attacks, light fast
stealthed keep raids etc.  Their recent tuning of guard ranges and
such has all but eliminated the ability or need to run to the close
frontier and deal with raiders. I and many others liked it better
before. Now RvR will be focused on keep taking and the primary
defenders of Keeps are NPC's. Thus turning RvR into high end PVE. 
/sigh
