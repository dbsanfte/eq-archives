I have the ID4 belt from Tak, I use it a lot in LDoN, about the only time 
I do.  Most groups I am with there is some use to slowing, so I do it, 
but I still find that I have more mana than I know what to do with, so, I 
nuke away.  It is particularly nice, having SCM3, and the Scaled Avatar 
Gloves which give me a 20% mana savings on my best poison nuke.  I end up 
spending minimal mana on the nuke, and doing noticable damage with it.
