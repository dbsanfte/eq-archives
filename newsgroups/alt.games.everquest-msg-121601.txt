first you need to define mentally ill.  i personally believe that depression
stuff can be a load of bs.  its generally a feeling that life sucks and it
will never get any better,  youre only a depressive if this statement is
wrong.  trust me on this the psych people that have had me cant come up with
an answer to that.  now im not saying this is the young mans case.  but when
you look at life and all you see is life for yourself getting worse and
worse, you start thinking why should i wait for the end of this bad film why
not check out right now and avoid the oncoming pain and misery.  ive been to
many counselors psychologists and psychiatrists, and they dont like me
because i tend to use logic and scientific reasoning to cut down there
entire list of ideas on why life will ge better. oh and by the way i need to
stop posting this is way off topic if you want to continue the discussion we
could pick it up in email

thanx for your time and sorry bout the OT stuff
