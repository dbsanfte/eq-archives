A crap one. :)  GeForce 2 mx 64mb. Worked fine before the graphics engine 
patch, though, except for some lag in Bazaar. For whatever reason now it 
just plays like crap everywhere if more than 1 or 2 other people are 
around. I thought the new engine was supposed to IMPROVE performance, not 
reduce it. :/

I will eventually be upgrading my entire PC, but not at this time.
