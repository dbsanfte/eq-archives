Oh c'mon Khosh.  Now you're being as obtuse as Malcolm and his "it's
pure economics" bullshit.

Because his threat, while real, is not as enormous as a nuclear-armed
North Korea, or a Saudi-financed Osama bin Laden.  On the other hand
he is a personal embarrassment to Dubya's old man, and (hopefully much
more important) he seems to be acting a lot more obnoxious recently
(a death wish perhaps?  maybe he thinks he's creating a living memory of
himself as a martyr, sort of a memetic Great Pyramid).

There's no particular reason to believe we'll handle that any better
than we've handled the Mideast, or for that matter how well we handled
Korea in the past, or Indochina, or ...  Nor is there any public
evidence that the military threat posed by Iraq is even vaguely
comparable to that posed by a nuclear-armed North Korea.  And please
tell me in which century you think the Mideast might possibly become
a place where use of the word "stable" is not a laughable oxymoron.

If you think the people making the key decisions on all sides of this
matter are not acutely aware of the economic implications of every
choice they make then you are ignoring reality.  It ain't simple.  It
ain't easy.  It's ugly, messy, complicated, and full of evils both
greater and lesser.  I'm hoping that our leaders are making good
decisions on all these matters, because once we've elected the bums
that's pretty much all we get to do until the next go around.  I know
for a fact that I'll never see anywhere near all the information that
they see, and it seems rather unlikely that they'll ever reveal all of
the motives and beliefs driving their choices.  But it seems as foolish
to deny the obvious (economic factors influence political decisions at
all levels) as it is to insist that economics alone drive everything.
