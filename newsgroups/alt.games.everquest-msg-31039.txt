Not 100% certain of how the guards will con to you, but as
an evil class ogguk should be open to you, as should grobb. 
You could try fighting in innothule, maybe camping lizards
outside of Cazic thule, or frogloks in innothule then moving
to upper guk as you level up.  There is also the grass part
of south ro, Orc camps galore on par with Orc hill in g'fay
and deathfist orcs in the commons.
