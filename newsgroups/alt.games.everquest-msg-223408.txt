You aren't seeing the point here.  In a collect mission, you end up 
killing a lot of mobs that don't drop what you need, and further can 
deliberately prolong things by not looting that last drop; the mission 
doesn't count your killing mobs with the collect item, you have to 
actually loot them.

Why does this matter?  Well, lets say there are 120 mobs in the dungeon, 
  and you have a slaughter 50 mission.  Kill 50 in 50 minutes, which 
isn't an extraordinary kill rate.  Now your mission ends, and you have 
30 minutes before the dungeon poofs.  How many more can you kill if you 
want to stay and clean house?  About 30.  Thats 80 out of 180.

Take a collect 25 mission, and it will probably take you 50 kills to get 
your 25 drops... but if you've gotten 24 drops in 48 minutes, you can 
stop looting the item and spend the next 40 minutes racking up 40 more 
kills, then loot one of the items rotting on the bodies you've left 
around, then you get 30 minutes to kill 30 more, for a total of 118 
kills out of 120.

IF your group is only going to do one mission, but can stay the whole 
two hours to do it, then a collect mission offers you a way to maximized 
mission length safely.  Not that I've ever seen anyone do it that way, 
but it seems to me thats Davian's point.

But if they take 50 minutes each, even with loot splitting and moving to 
the new location you can do two in two hours, doubling the AP points and 
leaving exp pretty much the same; you don't get extra exp for staying 
and killing every mob compared to killing the same number of mobs in a 
new dungeon.

I'm not at the stage where I'd skip names... IF I have a tracker in the 
group.  We decide whether to stay the half hour based mainly on whether 
we are going to do a second run or not though.
