My editor/newsreader doesn't recognize quoted text as special.  The only 
program I'd previously encountered that had a problem with it was a 
newsgroup stats reader, that was quickly reconfigured to account for my 
oddity.

It does help the human editor, me, recognize when it's text I've 
previously quoted, and spot when someone is actually responding to me.  
But mostly, I thought it looked nice.  And I think it may be shortsighted 
to center any 'standard' on a character that can make such a difference in 
HTML/XML, should newsgroup posting standards ever head off in such a 
direction, much as it would horrify me if they did.

And you'll also note that to my knowledge, there is no official standard 
(in netiquette, the RFCs, anywhere) on this particular issue.  There's 
just what the majority does.  I would be interested in knowing if there is 
an official standard that I overlooked, however.
