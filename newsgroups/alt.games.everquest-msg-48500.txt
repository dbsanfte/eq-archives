Both. Being the lowest level of the cancel magic series of spells, it only
removes 1 buff at a time, so if you are slowed but have 8 beneficial buffs
on top of it, it will take 9+ casts to remove the slow, which will strip
you of other buffs in the meantime.

At the level cancel magic is available, there is little need to use it.
However, it generates very low "help" aggro, and is one of the prefered
ways to pull single creatures out of groups.
