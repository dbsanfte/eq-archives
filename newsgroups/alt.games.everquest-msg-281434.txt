With my regular play hours being outside that of most on my server and 
guild, MMs have become a viable way to gain xp and AA from pick up groups 
where poor play, lack of understanding of the other folk's playing style 
causing group wipes is not a problem, no exp loss, not much to loot after 
first few circuits and roughly equivalent return on xp/time. Am I a newb, 
hardly. nearly 5 years playing my original alt still had them in late 50's 
with little prospect of advancing, now I can play, get exp and have a bit of 
fun.

If you're that riled up about folk using "cheats" and not just being sad 
letting others PL them, use /report, /bug, /petition or whatever. As to 
buckets full of AAs, it's always easy to tell a player who has worked hard 
for them rather than gained them overnight, by their superior play style and 
understanding of class, melee, hybrid or caster class and as such, tend to 
get regular group invites because of their ability, not AA's.
