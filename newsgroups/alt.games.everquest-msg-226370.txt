roflmao...  Is that what they're telling the developers too? "We're 
cutting back your wages because we're giving you advanced access to the 
game and a chance to help out in the development. We've now attached a 
value to that and will be deducting it from your cheques. Good news 
though, if you win a slot in public beta you won't have to pay! Good luck!"

You're right. What am I thinking?... I mean, I should be thrilled to 
volunteer my time... wait, not volunteer... I should pay them to let me 
help, no wait, I should not only pay them to let me help, I should also 
want to buy other products they make under the same 'brand' just as show 
of support, regardless of my utter lack of interest in them.

Its not like I NEED the original X2 DVD either, or EQ1, EQ2, EQ2 beta, 
or LOE. I'm not sure why you even brought 'need' up...it isn't relevant.
