As a number of us have pointed out, solo hunting does not preclude
interaction with other players.  But I've had quite a few grouped
combats that were far more fun than any solo combats.  And the
comaraderie that sometimes occurs in a group, perhaps often for
someone like you who has a "regular" group, is not the same as a
"chat experience" with folks you are not working with to overcome
challenges.  So it is not interaction per se, but rather the
particular quality of the interaction that can happen in a group
that I was referring to, which is why I avoided the word in my
initial reply.

I am not amazed, I was suggesting that you might be.  Apparently I was
reading things into your post that were not there, based on your
apparent misunderstanding of what I meant to say in my post.

Sorry if this reply is overly sober and earnest.  :)
