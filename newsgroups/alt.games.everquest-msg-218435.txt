And you know he had them....how? If there's been zero real evidence
found, how can you say without a doubt that he had them? All I've seen
are accusations. Nothing even semi-solid to back up the claims.

Nice, however, that you're such a lemming that you simply accept
anything Dubya says without needing any evidence to be convinced...

No, they hate us because we go around expecting the world to kiss our
feet and profess how we're the greatest, mightiest nation in the
world. Eventually, we're going to have everyone pissed off at us
enough with this that we're going to be having a bullseye painted on
our ass.

We could use this flawed line of logic to justify invading any
country. I doubt Iraq was even financially capable of supporting a
nuclear weapons program anymore. There hasn't been a shred of real
evidence since Desert Storm to support claims that he has WMD.

The false intelligence report about the purchase of nuclear material
from Africa that he passed on to the American people as truth knowing
full well it was false (in spite of what he claims. If he didn't know
it was false, people would have been fired the instant he found out
they knew before he passed it on and didn't tell him).

The CIA info was national secrets.
