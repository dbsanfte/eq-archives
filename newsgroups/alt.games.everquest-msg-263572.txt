It's more that I just don't think they really belong in a fantasy MMORPG,
because, even with the elaborate EQ2 system as described earlier, they still
have no connection to the skills one would really use to practice those
trades, and they don't advance any story.

Compare to, say, melee combat.  There is some overlap there between the
skills required for in-game combat, and skills that a real warrior would use
in real combat.  So, when you play at being a warrior in an MMORPG, you are
doing at least some of the things a real warrior would do.

For magical combat, there isn't a RL comparison, but we do have fictional
magic users to compare to, and in-game, we do many of the same things they
do.

Tradeskills, on the other hand, don't use any of the same skills that a RL
practicioner of that trade would use.  Without that connection, that just
leaves tradeskills for story...and if you think about most good heroic
fantasy, you'll notice that it doesn't spend a lot of time on tradeskills.
If the hero needs to make a special sword, it is a couple pages.  If it is a
movie, rather than a book, you'd see maybe a montage of scenes forging the
sword, with some stiring music playing, and be done with it--you wouldn't
see the 10000 practice blades the hero made first. :-)

So, I'd relegate tradeskills to be something that it is assumed your
character does while you are offline, like going to the bathroom, sleeping,
washing his clothes, balancing his bank accounts, and stuff like that.  This
would also make tradeskills something that most characters would do, making
them a better money sink.

I'd encourage that aspect, by making it so that tradeskill items you make
for yourself are better than items you buy or loot.  So, when you make your
own sword, it is perfectly customized for you, and so you get a bonus with
it.  It would not be NO DROP, but if anyone else uses it, they don't get the
bonus.
