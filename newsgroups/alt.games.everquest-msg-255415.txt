I think that's the thing. CoH and EQ are designed with different
targets in mind. Some people play for rewards such as gear. For other
people, the reward is simply winning the fight. Those who are leaving
CoH so shortly came to it expecting it to be geared toward the first
mindset only to find it was geared toward the latter. I think CoH does
that in a way that will hold the audience it's targetting.

The fact people are leaving doesn't mean the game is dying. Just means
it's settling into its niche audience.
