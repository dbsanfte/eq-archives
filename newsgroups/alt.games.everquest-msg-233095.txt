Drogmors are slightly cheaper I believe. Just make sure you boost your
CHA as much as you can before buying either a Horse or a Drogmor. They
are the same speed and give the same benefits in terms of no
sitting-aggro, additional mana from sitting, etc...

I have to admit, when Xanthalas is in full charge on his Droggy it
looks like the whiplash he's undergoing would probably break his neck!
