It is almost impossible to use a random generator to hack an account. Just
try to figure the number of possibilities of creating a valid name and
password to an unknown account 99.9% of the accounts hacked are from
stupidity of letting someone borrow your account or buying an account off
Ebay. It is possible to run a line monitor but that is very rare.
