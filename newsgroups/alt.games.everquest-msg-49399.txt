Yeah, and not only was CR trivial, it was an incredible zone to
explore.  Oh well, guess I'm don't have to worry about not taking the
faction hit for killing Velketor now.  I just wish I'd known about
this at 37, like the bard who showed it to me.  Gotta be a real
gut-clencher walking out from the pit and hitting track and seeing
dozens and dozens of red mobs.  Especially considering the wimpy range
on bard track.
