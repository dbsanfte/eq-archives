I can offer a bit of advice. It is not worth the money to upgrade to a
GF5200FX from a GF4Ti4200 -- an FX5200 is basically a glorified
GF4ti42000. When I bought one, I used it for a little while and found
that my framerate was actually WORSE off for games like
Counter-Strike, and I even lost the many handy features of the GF4
(TV-Out, Digital, multi-monitor support). 

I didn't try it with any new-technology based games, as a caveat. Five
days later, I shipped it to a friend of mine who was in need of a
videocard.

Now, if you don't need Multi-monitor-TVOut-Digital capabilities, go
right ahead and try out an FX5200 if they're only $60, unless you're
strapped for cash. The current gen of video cards (9800, whatever
NVidia is at now) is due for an extreme price-drop in the next 3
months, however.
