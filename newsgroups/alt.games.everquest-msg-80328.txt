I have dealt with pets for a LONG time.. I have a 53 Mage and now have
a 26 Beastlord.

Ok.. the other suggestions are great but here are a couple more  I
more or less treat warder like a chanter pet, cause I have found my
warder doesn't always act like a mage pet and thier pathing is a LOT
worse then mage pets.

If I am puller, I do two things.  If its a open area.. (hehe.. not
always handy), I park pet    back behind group with 
/pet guard here, then when I pull I do it from a distance and I
usually use slow spell to pull.

Also in a group if you get multiples and pet gets on wrong mob and
pisses off the chanter trying to mezz it.. I make sure everyone knows
to that I need to someone  (other then me) to take agro so I can
command it to back off.
Gawd.. I can't wait for enough alt xp to get /pet hold command
when you get that .. you can command pet not to attack  ANYTHING even
you or it gets hit!!  
I am ticked that that VI made it class type skill and archtype at
least.. you will have to make the equivalent of about 22 levels to get
it... sigh!


Now a question for others... is anyone else having trouble with warder
in regards to using /pet attack?
I have been in a room with just 2 mobs,  I have one targeted and I
give /pet attack command and he frigging goes around that mob and
attacks the other mob even if its not a similar mob.

Have gotten to where I don't wanna use it when in groups anymore or
even solo
