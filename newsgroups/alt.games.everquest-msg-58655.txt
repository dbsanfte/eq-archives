I am not going to argue the merits of shaman heal vs. others, I know I would
rather have a cleric around.  But all I can say is you group with some
pretty crappy shaman Ben.  I often act as the primary healer, but even when
I'm not, the only time I get any melee practice in is when I solo.  If I am
in a group, the only times I am not on my butt are when we are moving to a
new location, or when I am actively casting a spell.
