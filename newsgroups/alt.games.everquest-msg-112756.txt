Thanks for posting that. I am getting tired of doing the Ctrl-Alt-Del thing
each time. The blurb on it seems to imply that it enables you to delete
other tasks than show up with Ctrl-Alt-Del, which is good. I was sure there
must be others because how can I continue running on-line (cable), if I have
ostensibly killed all other (than explorer) tasks. Anyway, I am trying to
see if there is something running that is causing my problem. My system
freezes only when zoning (hmm, I have had a couple of other instances but
literally only a couple), only on one server (FV, hence 1 character, and I
have tested other servers/characters I use), usually between FV and LoIO but
not always. E.g. last night, I ported out of FM three times, ran zones,
ported other people, gated back to FV, then ran to FM each time. I failed
two out of three FV/LoIO zones, one other zoning, no group ports and one
gate (out of three) back to FV. I have minimal lag problems. This has been
happening since I installed Luclin. I had sound off originally. Putting it
on didn't make any difference except suddenly I started getting ddhelp
abends at startup so I switched it off again. Just recently, it happened
three camps in a row and it had never happened at camping before. I have had
periods when there was no problem at all (i.e. same port/run/gate/run as
above several times in a row with no problem). I have done the Ctl-Alt-Del
thing to remove all tasks and it ran fine for a while (until the problem
last night). I don't think that it is associated with other tasks running
but want to make sure.
