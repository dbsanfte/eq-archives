I'll try this one more time...
You _can_ choose to wear armor that does not encumber you.  You _can_
choose to carry weapons that do not encumber you.  You _can_ choose to
carry containers that do not encumber you.  If you are encumbered by
the first piece of loot you pick up you are stupidly equipped.  If you
whine at the enchanter for not casting his short duration gimp STR buff
that costs way more mana than it is worth you're being an idiot.  And
if you blame other people for not overcoming your mistakes you're a
lame-assed jerk desparately in need of a swift kick.

Yes, it's a game, and I don't care to have my enjoyment of it impaired
by people who whine constantly because they are incapable of accepting
their character's limitations and so they insist on doing stupid things
and blaming other players for the problems that result.
