What gear?  Fungi is a pretty common lowbie monk PLing item, and just that 1
item can change the outcome of each and every single fight

Well later on, with AA's, that wouldn't happen.
When we raid a place with undead mobs, I regularly see "aguild_paladin01
cleanses his blades for 9999999999 points of damage"  (ok slight
exageration, but hits between 2k and 4k on average)

Sure that doesn't make the lower end any more balanced.. if it really was a
problem, paladins should of gotten something more, there were a lot of ways
to deal with the problem, rather than cripple monks.

A generic AC fix would have resolved most tanking issues, all that extra AC
gear you wear would be worth a shit, a warrior would still be several
hundred AC above knights, thus retaining a clear advantage.

Rogues, monks and rangers wouldn't be tanking stuff highend as efficiently
as knights, and so on further down the chain.

But no, lets cripple monks.  So now monks can't tank for shit, but rogues
and rangers do just as well.   Maybe some day they will get nerfed too,
rather than fix the root problem.

I was in HoH at the weekend, and when I wanted to parse disc damage, the
ranger tanked (500 hitting mobs)

400 less HP than me, 200+ less AC than me, 100 less AA's than me (I have
cs3,ca3,lr5,id5 - he has none maxed) and he averaged out only needing 1 more
heal a fight than me (I was the cleric, so I saw clearly)

Oh well, I still have a tank in my rogue, once he gets chaotic anyway.
