I played a rogue to very low levels (19 I think) ages ago, and I recall a
similar discovery; deliberately tying hide to one of my arrow keys so it went
off constantly while I was running around shopping got my skill up pretty fast
and the difference was noticable.

This would be another edge for halflings, starting with hide 50 would be a
nice boost, although automating the skill ups really isn't arduous.
