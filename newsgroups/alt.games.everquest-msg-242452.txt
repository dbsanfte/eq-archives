Enchanter or cleric will have the easiest time to get a group.  Rogue
is most group _dependent_ of the ones you listed, but not most
popular.  I've found that it's usually harder to find a cleric than an
enchanter when you want one, and cleric are usually considered more
essential, but as I'm a bard enchanters are less of a necessity to my
groups, so YMMV.

As for race, I'd go with whichever one I most like the look of.  Stats
aren't that important, and are easy to increase.  Gnomes get
tinkering, which is a reason to go with them if you like
tradeskilling.
