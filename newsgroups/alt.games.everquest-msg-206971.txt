A shadowknight applicant to my guild had made it to phase two (wearing the
guildtag).  Most people had logged for the night, but some of us, including
the person who had brought the applicant in and the applicant, were helping
an enchanter out with an epic fight in Burning Woods.  When we ported in,
someone noticed that Talendor was up and we decided we'd come back and grab
him after the fight in BW.

After we took down Talendor (dropped CoF *and* RBB...  how's that for
one-in-a-million?), the guildleader gave the RBB to the applicant because,
get this, he was level 61 and didn't have a haste item.  Pretty unbelievable
eh?  It's better...  he de-guilded, de-apped and bitched out the guildleader
because he didn't get the CoF.  All within minutes after being handed a RBB,
which he of course walked away with.
