I replied to this post with the information that this spell would have to be
purchased by a friend in town somewhere, but have just found out other wise.
I don't know if this has been changed, or perhaps I just over looked it, but
this spell and other "non-necro"  spell are available in Paineel at the same
merchants that sell the standard necro spells.  There is one merchant who
sells ALL of these assorted non-necro spells.  I may have missed him
entirely, because once I found the merchant that had the spells of the level
I was looking for I may have assumed that all of the spells I needed would
be there. Anyway, FYI he is there and it is very helpful.
