If he's gotten so far on 103 int he will get much further, real fast...At
some point he'll work out how to get better items...The player, in question,
may not have SoL as yet and so buying from players is made harder (ok so
there is normally a market/auction channel he could use as well as just /auc
in populated zones) and when he does get the expansion things will move
along...
I have grouped with many a moron and watched them fly up the levels (just
leaving me behind isn't to hard) and, in one case, end up in a decent
guild...Just because they chose to level rather than learn doesn't mean they
will never learn and they'll always be the incompetent moron they were...
I'm willing to bet if said in Enchanter is still around when OP is 60 then
'chanter is 65.
