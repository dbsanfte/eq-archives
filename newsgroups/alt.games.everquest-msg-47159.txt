Depends on what you are fighting.  How about if I said "essentially full
mana and health?"

Engulfing Darkness

run for the pet

Pause to cast Leach

Arrive at pet

/pet attack

Fear

Allure of death

Sit

Stand up long enough to get close to victim

Sit

Loot fallen mob

Go look for next victim.

If the mob is yellow, then you need to apply other DOTs,
and likely reapply Fear at least once... like as not need to
reapply Leach too.  This will put you down a little in mana,
certainly not enough to require that you not pull a blue.
If you end up low enough, pull a green just so you have something
to leach.

Leach and Allure means you regen an extra 8 mana per tick
while breaking even on health.  Pet killing in a fear kite means
you lose no health to the fight, and you lose no med time.

Fear kiting with a pet to do the work, and with the leach/allure
combo for mana regen, so that you sit while you kill... I can't
think of a more efficient way to kill one mob solo, and that
includes my cleric method of training to a "guard" mob that I
then root and atone when the target starts to run.

The question is, is quad kite and med the mana back more
efficient in terms of mobs per hour?
