What makes you say that?

This is why I think they will;

If UO is doing it, then EQ will at least be
thinking about it.

Also, it cuts e-bay out of the loop. To what
extent they cut e-bay out will be dependent on
what sort of things they will offer for cash.

If they do it a little bit at a time, then they
may not alienate the majority of the playerbase.

>If more people do this
>they'll eventually figure out it's a bad idea when they go bankrupt.

Its possible that people might leave in droves,
but its also possible that it might attract more
players.

Who has the figures?

For you? Maybe none.

Not everyone plays the same way. Some people don't
have the time to level up, some people just find
the levelling aspect dull and boring.

The typical early player of EQ probably came from
a AD&D, or MUD background, used to slow progress,
prepared to put in a lot of hard work. 

The times they are a'changing however. Maybe the
newer players don't have the determination, or
time, or the inclination, to spend years working
on a character.

This doesn't meant that EQ doesn't want their
money.

The market will dictate it. SOE are not idealists.

I can see why it might make you puke, but its not
unfair. All players will have the same opportunity

What is not fair is enforcing your style of play
over any other.

It may, and it may not, but I am sure they will
try it, to some extent.
