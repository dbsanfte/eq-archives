I'm wondering a bit at that. Seems to me that there's only so many
quests in one area to get you through that level set, and only just
barely. What this means, in practice, is that once you've done the
quests as, say, a dwarf in their newbie yards, you've done *all* the
quests there and if you ever make another dwarf (or a gnome since they
start there too), you'll be doing the *exact same quests* because
thats all there is. Sure, you could run to another newbie yard, but
that just puts off the same problem.

For all the vaunted number of quests, it doesn't look like there's
actually enough to make a unique playing experience past a couple
playthroughs. Maybe one per race, up to a certain level. After
that....

But other people's experiences are challenging that. Sounds like both
cases can result in KSing.

Another concern Bob didn't bring up is that this quest system seems to
encourage some bottomfeeding if a higher level gets a quest that isn't
really suited for their level. They go do it anyways, because its a
quest....

DAoC itself is an attempt to copy EQ and fix its flaws... failing to
do so in its own way.
