A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the
name Menwith <menwith@hill.com>:

>Well, I got obsoleted.

How so? The latest patch didn't really change any classes. There have
been many times in the history of EQ where this excuse might have made
sense, but now?


>Of course, SOE's decision is understandable,

Japanese culture considers pinkhaired women with eyes the size of
bowling balls being raped by tentacles while oozing juices from every
orifice to be normal, too. Kind of puts that into perspective.


>I guess I'll try Anarchy Online.

I've heard its much better now. But I will never play a game that has
that sort of instanced puke as such a major portion of it.


>Thanks for adventuring with me,
>good hunting, and
>enjoy the game,
>whichever game you choose.

Who are you again?
