I often wonder what people bring to this 'game' . I wonder when i don't see
a friend online for a long time... if maybe something happened and  i was to
far away to find out...
I bring to Norrath the same things i bring to this Real world....
friendship, compasion and hope... I have met many along my jagged life in
EQ... I have had many people tell me how 'addicted' i have become... but I
don't care you can't be addicted to spending time with a friend... or a
group of people you trust and cherish.
