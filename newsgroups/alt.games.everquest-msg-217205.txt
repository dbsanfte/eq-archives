Just for the sake of completeness, I checked last night and out SK has
1500ac and a bit over 7200HP with group buffs. More than I expected
for a non-raid player. He tanked an unslowable named that hit for 900
last night in BoT without much trouble so I feel reasonbly confident
we could handle the tanking on a hard mission. DPS will be a problem,
it's  a scary group where my Shaman is the highest DPS class there
