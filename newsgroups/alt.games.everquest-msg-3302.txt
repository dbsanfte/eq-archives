I grouped with a level 30 SK with the noctivigant blade the other day.
I mentioned it to a friend in Karnor's, who muttered something about
damn twinks and having lost rolls for that sword five times.

Since my shadow knight is somewhat too frail to be lugging a huge bag
of heavy weapons around, and I also have a warrior... how many of
these good 2hb (and piercing) weapons are SK only?
(I guess I should get cracking on those tailored bags)

I leave tradeskills to my druid. She has no problems getting veggies,
berries, eggs and whatever else can be foraged. My tanks will limit
themselves to making arrows.

And they'd be made of no drop components and trivial at 200+, eh?

Other than the tradeskill part; fish is edible uncooked.

Brewing is nice for tailors and specialty smiths (tempers, kiola and
other curing agents) My brewing is 92 and my AT is 0 or 1 (I might
have accidentally clicked a bottle once) And it gives me something to
do with my veggies.
