Indeed.
It took a while to get the hang of making the best of the HO system for 
my warrior when playing solo. It wouldn't suprise me if guild groups who 
play together a lot start making use of set piece moves to trigger HOs 
after they's played together a lot.

I doubt it will ever be useful to pickup groups though. Too hard.
