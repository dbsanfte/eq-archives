Well, I started this thread, and last night I took the plunge,
formatted Win2k off and installed ME.  The first thing I did was to
get the really important things back up, sound card, video drivers, EQ
:-)      I fired up EQ and ran around trying stuff for about 30
minutes.  The video was smoother, no stalls, the music never studdered
while I moved around, and I got sounds I never heard before....so the
OS may not be as solid or secure as 2000, but it certainly makes the
EQ experience better......now if I can just talk the wife into that
GeForce3........
