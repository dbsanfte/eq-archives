You rely *way* too much on your repeated slinging of the phrase
"amateur rules lawyer".  It adds little to your case even when
used in a relevant manner (other than as a bit of typical
ad hominem attack), and it only looks even sillier when you use
it, as above, in a manner that doesn't even apply to your point.

I am not being an "amateur rules lawyer" in any way whatsoever when
I truthfully say that no, I did *not* immediately see the spoonerism
in "Tigole Bitties".  I had seen it before on websites, and never
noticed the spoonerism, since I read the first name as "tie-gole".
I only saw the spoonerism after I looked at the name several times
trying to figure out why you were complaining about it in this thread.

Now, can you dispense with the namecalling, and do me the courtesy
of taking my claims as honest statements, or are you going
to be an "amateur prosecution lawyer" and try to treat everything
I say as a self-serving lie?

Let me know before I bother to respond to you again.

Ooh, what a masterful rebuttal.

The fact that a misspelling is *involved* doesn't make it
a rules violation.  In order to be a rules violation, it would
have to a misspelling of a DISALLOWED WORD/PHRASE.  Otherwise
"Trehugger" would be a rules violation, but it is not -- unless
you're going to try to claim that it's a severe "misspelling"
of "Treehumper", or even "Potsmoker".

And "Tigole" is not a misspelling of anything that is disallowed.
Neither is "Bitties".  Neither is "Tigole Bitties".  What it *is*
is a REARRANGEMENT of a misspelling of a disallowed word/phrase.
And regardless of your boggling and repeated flingings of the
phrase "amateur rules lawyer", rearranging a name to the point
where it is only objectionable if the reader himself shuffles
the name around in his head does not happen to be listed in
the naming rules.

Perhaps it ought to be.  But it isn't.  That's my
entire point, I don't know why it amazes you so, it's
not that earth-shattering or hard to grasp.

Swapping parts of words, especially exchanging parts of words
*between* two words, goes beyond mere misspelling.  "Mae I
show yoo to a seet" is a misspelling.  "May I sew you to a sheet"
is not a misspelling, it's a spoonerism, and is another kind of
change entirely.  "I would like another serving of parrots and
keys" is not a misspelling either, nor would the nature of
the alteration be any less profound if some of that sentence
were actually misspelled as well.


><snip miles of amateur rules lawyer explanations>

I will take this as an admission that you can't mount an
adequate rebuttal.

I will also take it as an admission that you're *way* too
much in love with the phrase "amateur rules lawyer".

And when there is such a failure, it ought to be addressed in
exactly the same way that gaps in RL laws are handled -- amend them
to cover the case(s) you forgot to cover the first time around.

The solution is *NOT* to simply say, "well we wrote these rules so
people could determine which names were not allowed, but screw it,
we'll ignore our own rules list anytime we want and revert back to
'because we feel like it'".

The written rules either mean what they say, or they don't.
I want them to have meaning.  You want them to be merely "suggestions"
that the GM's can arbitrarily ignore or exceed at any time, leaving
the players nothing firm to rely on.

That would depend.

If the GM actually cared about following the rules, if he believed that
the rules had any meaning at all, he would see it as a loophole that
needed to be fixed the next time the rules were up for revision.

If the GM didn't care about Verant saying one thing then doing another
(as has been the case far too often), then he might well force the
name change and add yet more evidence to the common claim that
Verant can't be counted on to mean what they actually say.

Which would you prefer?

No, no, you were clearly trying to write "amateur rules lawyer",
but your spelling is atrocious.

I'm sorry, at that point you've gone beyond "misspelling", so your
example is moot.  Your above two examples are misspellings.  This
one is not.  Exchanges of word parts, especially across words, is
another class of "mistake" entirely.  It is not a misspelling,
unless you're going to be enough of an "amateur rules lawyer" yourself
to classify *any* combination of letters that is "suggestive" of
another as a "misspelling", even though that severely distorts
the clear meaning of the word "misspelling".

Lincoln once asked a fellow, "if you call a tail a leg, how many
legs does a dog have"?  The man answered, "five".  Lincoln replied,
"no, it has four -- calling a tail a leg does not make it one."

Similarly, calling word-part exchanges "misspellings" does not
make them so.

(Another interesting point is that spoonerisms, unlike
misppellings, can be carried over intact into spoken language
without losing any information, which shows that they are
a construct independent of spelling/misspelling.)

I saw a license plate the other day that read "2th".  Clearly
the car was owned by a dentist.  Was that a "mispelling"?
No it was not, it was a sound-alike play on words since it
relies on the pronunciation of the word of one of the
characters it contains.  It's a different class of
word-alteration entirely from a "misspelling".

And so is a word-part-exchanging spoonerism, I'm sorry
to have to inform you.
