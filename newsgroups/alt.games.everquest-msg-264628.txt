What was very bizarre to me was that Lucas Arts had no problems with the 
game in the sense that, for example, bounty hunters were being made into 
artisan's bitches or that smugglers had nothing to smuggle or that 
droids were irrelevant but everyone could have 3 rancors out - no, Lucas 
Arts (and I am absolutely not kidding) was upset that trandoshan women 
had boobs.

Seriously - look it up. Trandoshan boobies were a real big issue 
(ba-DUM-bum!) while other, far more critical issues were ignored.
