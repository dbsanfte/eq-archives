Despite it's origins in the Department of Defense, the internet has
become a global communications means.   Consequently, posters to
usenet aren't limited to the use of english in posting.

The perception of any newsgroup as "english only" or preferred is
rather short-sighted.  Usenet groups aren't usually moderated, so
there is no practical means of enforcing a language.  Some groups,
particularly those that are specifically designated for non-english
may or may not respond when someone posts in a language other than the
dominant language for that group.

Not everyone is the comfortable writing in a foreign language, and
English is peculiarly difficult to learn to write.  I have responded
to people who post in German, French, Spanish, and Czech over the 20+
years I've been an internet user.  If you get the gist of their
request, go ahead and respond in english.  

I would suggest that if you don't read the language in which someone's
posted, just ignore it and move on.   Despite what some people may
think, the fact that someone posts in a language other than english
really doesn't mean they're talking about you.
