My position is that I think new content is great. Not necessarily new
expansions, but improvements to the graphical engine, and adding new
content to old zones is something I highly approve of. Even if it
means that there will be bugs, and the accompanying time to fix those
bugs.

However, since it seems that SoE will finally be focusing on fixing
the bugs that are in the system, it seems like a good idea to go over
the bugs that we know about.

I'm sure they have extensive databases full of all the bug reports
that people send in, but I'd like to go over a few consistent bugs
that people feel need to be addressed.

The only consistent bugs I know of, that effect me are horse related:

1.) Sometimes when looting from a horse, you will get the message that
"someone is already looting that corpse". Even when I'm soloing. This
happens quite often. Also when you manage to loot the corpse, it will
not allow you to pick up some of the items. Since I really only loot
from a horse regularly when I am soloing, I have only gotten this bug
in freeport and everfrost. When I click the horse off, the problem
goes away.

2.) Combat from a horse does not work so well. Obviously SoE intended
people to melee from horses, or why make those lances. However, I
routinely get the message "you are too far away" even when I am
standing so close that I can see through them.

3.) Sometimes you can't cast from a horse. This has really only
effected me in PoJ. You can cast ok for a little while, then all your
spells fizzle, without the fizzle message and without loss of mana.
Kinda' like ducking does. If you click the horse off and click it back
on, the problem goes away for a little while.

I get crashes to desktop occasionally in PoK, but nothing that can be
repeated.

I'm sure others have bugs theyï¿½d like to bring up.
