$40 a month buys you access to a server with 15 or so GMs and new content,
how would $15 a month pay for that on all servers? Those GM's aren't working
for free.

Personally I'd rather have a choice of pay more for the more dynamic server
or pay the same and keep playing the game that was fine for me before
Legends was released.
