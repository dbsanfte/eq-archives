    First, a disclaimer.  I feel that while EQL is not dying in the
sense that it will be around for a few years yet, it is in a state of
decline.  This is my opinion; I could be wrong.  

   I started a server merger pool right before EQII was launched, and it
ended with the merger of the Zeks.  However, it felt a bit fast to be
truly satisfying, at least to me.  So here is the Server Merger Pool
Part Deux.  Everyone who was in the first pool is in the second, since I
am just cut and pasting the old list over, and making modifications as
needed.  If you wish to join in, then just respond to this thread with
your month, day, and year.  If you leave off the year, I will assume you
mean the earliest date this month and day can fall.  The prize is an
imaginary VW flower painted van.  This one has no radio, but it does
have a cool black light poster taped to the ceiling so you can lay on
your back on the shag rug and just dig it.

   I've decided to not include the European or Legends Servers in this
list.  This is for the "normal" servers, and Firiona Vie. 

   Enough exposition.  On to the list!

 Oneiromancer............... March 15, 2005   <--- Our last winner.  Not
in new pool until he submits another date.

 Mary Poppins............... Never  <--- Technically already a loser,
since the Zeks merged.  But will allow this answer for other servers.


Note:  Dan Russell picked April 1, 2005, a day already picked by
Celaeno.  I should have caught this when it was first posted, but
didn't.  Oops.  Please pick another date if you want to be in the pool.

   Don't be shy kids.  Post new entry or corrections/modifications to
the list now!
