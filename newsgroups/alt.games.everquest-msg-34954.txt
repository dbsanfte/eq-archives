I never felt very excited about anarchy online or asherons call. I feel
curious about DAoC though. I'll at least give it a try... not sure why.

I am really hoping Luclin brings out a lot more interesting content
for a non uber 53 like me.... More and more I feel almost isolated from
whats going on on my server as friends and guildies leave for "uber"
guilds and then suddenly vanish as if they'd never existed, swept into
their new working life as UberZerg_3409

sigh
