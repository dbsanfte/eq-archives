	Joining two clauses with a comma does not make them logically
connected.  Lack of testing means that defects will appear in production.
It doesn't predict what those defects will be or where they will appear.

	To do that you'd have to TEST.

	Yup.  Exactly the attitude that's getting Sony in trouble.
"It compiles.  Ship it."   They're not the first to take that attitude
and they won't be the last, but it's wrong on many levels.


	BTW, we *do* see client crashes.  I can crash my client simply
by leaving my trader up for a long enough time then trying to switch
characters.  I can also crash it by switching back to the character
selection screen "enough".  It's reproducible enough so that I always
log back to the desktop before doing anything important. That's not the 
kind of bug I'm talking about.  I'm talking about rolling out production
releases that are obviously broken in trivially TESTABLE ways.  All new AAs
don't work.  No songs work.  Spell gems don't refresh unless you zone.

	I do.  They didn't notice because they didn't look.  Because
if they HAD looked there's NO WAY they could have missed it.

	Oh, think so?  

>Maybe they just assumed in that case that all was working. 

	Yes, exactly.  They don't bother testing because it's just
a game, testing sucks, and anyway it's time for foosball.  It's still
1991 at SOE.

>You're applying pie in the sky requirements to a shoestring budget,

	Bullshit.  Proper QA saves tons of money.  It costs 100 times
as much to fix a bug that's been rolled out to production as it does
to fix it in system test, and it costs 10 times as much to fix it in 
system test as it does to fix it in unit test.  If someone at Sony 
demanded they stop and get this right you'd all get your 25 new zones hardly
anyone will ever see each and every year and the rest of us might not have
to whine about the way hill giants warp when you try and kite them.

	Got some evidence of that statement, you loopy malcontent who
doesn't seem to understand the first thing about proper software engineering?
(You're right!  Gratuitous insults are fun! And here I was wasting my time
trying to keep this on an adult level...)
