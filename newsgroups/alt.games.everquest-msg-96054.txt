There is no time limit. You can move back to your original server if you
want to quit Legends (as a friend is doing because there simply isn't the
extra content to justify the additional subscription), all Verant have said
is that they won't allow Legends transfers to become a means of getting
around ebay and server economy rules, therefore they reserve the right (a)
to remove Legends items before you move back and (b) to impose a 6 months
qualifying period for transfer in the case of those suspected of trying it
on. The latter will obviously apply primarily to those who seek to switch to
and from Legends several times.
