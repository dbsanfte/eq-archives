Yup, and those of us with only lowish characters were just screwed.
I forget what level my monk was at the time -- somewhere in the 20s.
I could beat up the wimpiest of the skel armies, but they were green
so big whoop.  If I got lucky I could pick off an occasional higher
level skel.  But mostly if I spent any time at all in those zones
while the armies were out, I'd eventually get mind-controlled (or
maybe it was just Fear) and find myself running uncontrollably while
being whacked to death.  Couldn't even Feign Death to avoid it.

I did get a few nice items for the monk and also my druid, but only
by showing up at dawn so I could scavenge the last few corpses after
the armies had vanished.  (I always asked permission, of course.)
Plus a couple of times a high level Enchanter friend put IVU on me
so I could hang out while he killed a Commander and let me loot it.
It was nice to get the gear, but not real fulfilling for my chars.

For the most part, I just avoided all the skel army zones at night
while the event was running, and wished they'd gotten done with it
a lot sooner.

Level-appropriate content, my foot!
