I very much want to agree with you, but I fear we're falling victim to 
nostalgia. During Velious and Kunark the game hadn't "topped out" by a 
long shot. There were still new people flooding into EQ every week. 
There were a few guilds at the top, a few more in the middle, fighting 
it out with each other, but the majority of players were still low and 
mid level, struggling their way up through a tough game in a huge 
demanding world, dreaming of the day they might make it to level 50, 55, 
60 and play "with the big boys."  So the world really WAS huge.

Now most (not all, but most) of the low/mid level players you see are 
bots of 65 mains PLing their way up and ignoring most of the low/mid 
level content. Of the rest, I'd guess most are the casual players who 
really have no interest in "maxxing out" and dont' plan to do so. As was 
mentioned in another thread, SOE saw the mistake of dumping a ton of 
time into developing low and mid level content in LoY which most people 
would just wind up skipping.
