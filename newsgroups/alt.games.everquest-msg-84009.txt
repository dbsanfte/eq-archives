That's actually a very good point.  If EQ had ended up like
Diablo/Unreal/UO, then I most likely would have never even looked at the
game.

Well, OK, I probably would have *looked* at it, but it would have never made
it with me to the check-out stand.

How much larger is EQ's player base today, because they didn't follow
conventional gaming marketing practices back in the development stage?  Only
Sony's market analysts can guess....
