Not going to go over the wife thing, not working well in my house.

As for the hot key, besides reusing a social button, you can, and I
discovered this by accident (fat fingers and all) type /ho Loc /loc and you
will have a button on your cursor called Loc.  Place it and right click and
you will see the /loc in the first line of the commands.  I was happy to
find this, since I was fast running out of social buttons to commandeer.

I presume that /ho is short for /hotkey or some such.

Best of luck.
