It's ambiguous because it is not a fair comparison.   The entire game is
slower.  Next we'll have someone arguing that the game is anti group because
groups level so slowly that it is equivalent to fighting all light blues in
EQL.

Yes, it'll take a rather large amount of orange con mobs to solo your way to
the next level.  But for EQ2, in relation to the other things that you can do
in EQ2, you are making decent experience and loot.   In relation to how fast
you'd be leveling in EQ1, yeah, it's as if you were fighting light blues, if
you look at nothing other than pure speed.  (Because we all know racing to 50
is what the game is all about :p)
