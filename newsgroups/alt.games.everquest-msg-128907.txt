    You sometimes do that even with some form of Invis. I've seen See Invis
dogs spawn in the guard spots at the door leading from the King Room to the
cave area with SBM zone in it. Even tested it with a /con from a distance
while Invis - one would be Indifferent, the other Scowls. Unless you knew
that dog was there and used the dropdown in the other direction you'd be
training all the way.
