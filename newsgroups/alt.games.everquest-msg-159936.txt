Rivervale is fine except there is that wanderer female halfling, whose name
eludes me, whose faction is impossible to improve. She is quite tough. The
firona vie outpost one is safe, if you call being dumped far from the city,
with hordes of sowed creatures with see invis safe. They are very green but
still aggro on my iksar and the guards will not help you against them. The
guards, as far as I can tell, merely act to kill player characters who
haven't killed the prerequisite number of goblins.

I managed to get my 2nd lv halfling rogue into FV, regardless. She nearly
made it into cabilis. Haven't tried neriak yet. Got her everywhere else
though. I was pretty much satisifed that this heralded the death of the port
for plat, and look forward to the next expansion, with the free kei and rez
books on pedestals :-)

Hey, I'd pay for that!
