I'm confused by the reports. I really wish i could play eq2 for a couple of
weeks at different levels (like on the test server with testbuff) to see if
it really is good for the casual (sorry time-limited!) player.

On the other hand there's things in eq i always wanted to do like get my
epics for my mains, or get to level 65, and when i think about it, i haven't
been to about half the zones or perhaps more, as they recquire raiding, and
i feel sad that I have to abandon characters I invested so much in. I guess
that's the problem with MMOGs, you can't take the characters with you when
the game folds.

So what's the consensus? If I move to eq2, I'm still going to be time
limited, health limited (I can't play for extended periods due to health),
zone limited (I live in australia which rules out raiding on Rodcet Nife as
a rule)... am i going to find myself in a bottleneck like i am in eq, where
my gear stops me from getting the groups or the cash to progress?

And what's the death penalty like? I hate the eq dependence on a cleric rez;
there's few situations where a druid is vital, or a monk, but a cleric could
always raise cash if they wanted sellign buffs, and if they felt generous,
rezzes, but I've been in the bazaar offering 200 for a rez and had no
reaction despite many clerics being there, because if they needed the cash,
being a buff bot would be more profitable.
