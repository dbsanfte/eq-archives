Crucial part of this post - "on their message board". You see, if
Verant owns the message board, *they* are the ones who decide what can
and cannot be said there.

Since you mention "free speech" and the First Amendment, perhaps this
would be a good time for you to discover what that most excellent
portion of The Constitution of the United States of America actually
says...

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."

Note the very first part - "Congress shall make no law". That doesn't
say squat about what Verant can or cannot do with regards to their own
message boards.

You want to anonymously criticize a company, go ahead - they cannot
stop you. But they don't have to let you do it on their system.
