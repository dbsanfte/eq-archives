Of course. When it comes to taunting, paladins will bean monks, of 
course. However, the conversation started with the ability to take 
damage, namely the defense caps.

Generally in competent groups where casters don't overcast I don't have 
a problem keeping mobs on me (most times I outtaunt warriors, though SKs 
outtaunt me by much). The only problem is with enchanters -- I can't 
just hit taunt a few times before breaking mez. So we end up rooting the 
mob and stunning it before I break it, which, of course, is much fishier 
than just taunting

Of course not. They wouldn't call someone with the least efficient 
damage in the game a "king of damage", would they? Oh, wait, they did...
Problem is that Verant makes mistakes and sticks to them
