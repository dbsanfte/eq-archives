One way my level 30 druid made money was gating people around the planet.
Twinked out level 2 runs up to me when I'm medding in WC.

a_level2_twink_001: Hey bro can you gate me to NK, I'll give u 30 plat. I'm
running to Qeynos.
me: Sure. You want a SoW and camo too? You're kind of low level for NK.
a_level2_twink_001: Don't worry I run through there all the time with my
level 49 rogue.
me: You sure?
a_level2_twink_001: yup.

... 2 minutes after gate ...

a_level2_twink_001 tells you, "Can you come and get me dude, I was bound in
Kelethin and I don't want my full suit of crafted to decay... I died
somewhere in west karanas."
