Yes, thus the point that say would have to reach twice as far as maximum
heal range plus a bit.  Tank will never need to hear me at more than
heal range... as that heal -isn't- coming no matter what my social might
say, if he's out of range.  But if a fellow healer is positioned within heal
range of that tank I'm healing, or even moving into position to heal,
then its important that he hear me so he doesn't waste mana that we
may need.

/say might work for that, have never tested it.  Know for certain that
/ooc -does- work for that.

I'm lost as to what the relevance of these definitions would be.  Other than
the addition of a "group event" category (I'd call anything over one group
a small raid, up to three groups a raid, and anything larger a large raid... all

raids, which to me are defined by going outside group boundaries) I don't know
what it is you thought I might mean by a raid... must have people wearing plaid
to be a raid?

If you are in a zone with two raids (or events or whatever you care to call
clusters of players working together that aren't all in the same group) and
you have split channels so you have ooc, then it isn't going to bother the
other cluster that you /ooc heals... in fact, they are never going to know that
you do so, since they have filtered that channel out.  You could be giving the
RBI stats of the 49 yankees in ooc for all they know or care... the people
that might complain are the non-raiding folks that thought /ooc was there
for them to chat about the latest episode of Felicity while they med.

I'm not suggesting that if your raid (Event/cluster) is using /ooc that you
for some reason should use /auction or /shout for your heals, that would
make no sense at all.  Use "your" channel for your communications, that's
the whole reason you split the channels up!
