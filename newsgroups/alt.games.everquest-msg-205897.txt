So you are saying that you want to be governed by the same exact rules 
as NPCs?  Are you sure you are ready for such things as a forced death 
march when low on health and complete ignorance of your friend's well 
being if they are attacked beyond a very short range from you?  Ever 
seen a mob pull a player back to his group?  Pullers would run out, 
engage and then have to solo mobs rather than return to their group.

Not sure if you are being intentionally stupid or if you are just 
stupid, but if you can't see why MoB AI is programmed to allow simple 
instruction sets to avoid being exploited and human players are expected 
to use their complex brains to deal with the environment I am guessing
