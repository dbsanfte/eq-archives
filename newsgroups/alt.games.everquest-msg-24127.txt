It shows all mobs in the zone, how much exp they are worth at your level,
the exact exp number you have, how much more exp till next level, how amny
mobs of a type you need to kill to level, what loot they have etc. It can
supposedly also show the other players in the zone and their level and
everything they have on their person (even in bags)
But, if you have all this information atyour disposal...why even play the
game? You may as well go back to playing pong or something.
