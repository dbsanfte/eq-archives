Hehe, at least you "only" got stuck for a while. My main wood elf druid 
were doing a serious spell buying (got all nodrop NPC untill level 59, 
apart from Levitation, Everlating Breath, Remove Curse) and some 
tailoring supply restocking. And since i HATE running out of money when 
i shop, i had bought all my money on me, who cares since it dont weight 
anything in bazaar.
Druid guildie port in with a shitload of acrylia stuff i have make to 
bonings, and after making a few i get hit by the nice poof item bug 
(happened twice now, smithing at the forge at stables, after failed 
combine i go LD, and when i get back in, the chicel, i had in my cursor 
have poofed), and have to go get a new chicel so he can get back to The 
Deep. So click on my porting pants, and wait for Misty Thicket to show up.
Unfortunately i had forgotten that 100K+ in money, and around 300 in 
weight on acrylia DO have an effect outside Bazaar, and had forgot to 
refresh SoE, so after zoning, i ended up in a wierd Hesten-shaped hole 
at porting, and ended up back in bazaar again.
No GMs on, so had to eat a 90% rez from guild cleric.
