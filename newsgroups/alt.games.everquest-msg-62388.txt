Something to keep in mind, though not really relevant in this thread is the
following thread on Verant's board:

http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/008157.html

I have no idea if it does or not, but some folks are saying that TNT2
doesn't have T&L support and they provide links to give evidence of their
opinion.

Like I said, this isn't relevant to this thread...I'm assuming your lockups
are happening with the DX7 setup.  You might want to check Microsoft's HCL
for Win2k to see if all of your hardware is listed as supported (though it'd
surprise me if it wasn't).
