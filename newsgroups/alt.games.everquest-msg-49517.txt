    I "walk away" for short periods of time constantly. It's all about
recognizing that you need to do other stuff, too, to avoid the "trapped
levelling" syndrome. In my case, my family has season tickets to the
Canucks, and I'll also arrange with friends to go to the movies every so
often. Try cutting back to just a few nights a week, instead of cold
turkey - it should help.
