After this much discussion, obviously I had to check it out.   First of all, for
anybody who thinks the entire thing is a walk in the park where some low level
player can "exploit" their way to instant fame and fortune, it's not. I'd never
been to Vellious, and am no where near high enough level with any of my
characters to go, but I had that bastardly 21st level wizard sitting around, and
figuring that he was no great loss, decided to give it a go.  Got a port to IC
and proceeded to try the invis run to Thurg with a friend who knew the way.
Just as we were approaching the EW zone line, I managed to miss the "invis
fading" warning, and I appeared right in front of *something* (still not sure
what) that hit me three times taking me down to less than one bub of health as I
ran SoW'd across the zone.
  Finally made it to Thurg and found the meat shop, bound myself there, loaded
up and gated back to Feymart. Busker is absolutely right. This quest is a
*monumental* PITA.  Juggling your inventory to have open slots, having to pick
up single shark meats out of the stack and put them into a four slot container,
combine, hand to quest NPC, get faction hit, xp, and make sure you have room for
the weapon he hands you. (Weapon can be anything from a bronze rapier that sells
for several plat to a rusty spear.) But I can see where the cash adds up fast.
Turned a profit of better than 300 plat on that trip, but it literally took
*HOURS* to exchange all the meat.
  The really shocking part of it was the xp that this quest gives. I didnt' even
pay attention since I'd never seen a quest that even moved my xp bar except for
the GLS gypsy quest.  So I was pretty shocked when my wizard dinged 22 while
doing this quest.  I bet if you were handing the backpacks of meat to your lvl 1
twink in feymart you'd be level 10 in a few backpack's full.
  Oh, and the faction hits very quickly turn you into an "Allie" with both the
guards and merchants there. We decided that today my partner is making a High
Elf chanter with max charisma to get up to Allie faction just to be a shopping
mule.
  So all in all, yes. The quest is a collosal pain in the ass.  Yes, I can see
how it can still be profiitable if you have the patience, and it can have it's
uses.  But if you don't have a wizard with bind affinity, gate, and the feymart
port spell, I'd say it's definitely not worth your time.
  (On the plus side, I finally did get to poke my nose around in Vellious prior
to taking my warriro there. That was pretty cool.)
