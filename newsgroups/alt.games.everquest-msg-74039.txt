Why do folks keep asking this question?
:-)

What does Mark always say?
Tboots, or if you don't want to spend
the plat, camp for JBoots.

Seriously, your kit is fine for any level
wizard.  Add the speedie-booties and you
can group all you want or solo all you want.

Again, my level <now> 49 wizard is dressed
in Tboots and a Dragoon Dirk.  And has
been since level 6, when she bought her
boots.
