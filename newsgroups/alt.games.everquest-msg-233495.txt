I helped a chantey friend of mine the other night with this mob for his
epic. The group he put together was all in mid to upper 50's.  It was just
as you described. The meleer's pounding away and finally getting him down to
low health then he'd run off and heal before we could all catch back up with
him. Those one way doors were a pain.  Finally, someone came up with the
idea of pulling him to the opening in the water which was the way we came
in.  The puller pulled him to the edge and jumped in the water. He followed
and everyone in the group jumped in. We fought him under water and when he
tried to run away at low health he moved much slower and had no one way
doors to go through, and down he went. We spent almost an hour there trying
to kill him the "traditional" way and only took a couple of minutes to do it
this way.
