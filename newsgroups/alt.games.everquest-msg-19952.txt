Why? When was the last time you saw someone with the nickname
"Ikillyomama"? Now, how many times have you heard of a woman with the
nickname "Kitty"? That's why.

As long as a character "nickname" in the game is inoffensive and fits
the guidelines, fine. But, "Ubashem Ihealu" doesn't fit realisticly as
a nickname. "Basher" would, but "Ibashem" wouldn't. "Doc" would, but
"Iamahealer" wouldn't.

Again, as I said, "Kitty Kat" isn't really a phrase, it's more of a
compound word (Kitty-cat).
