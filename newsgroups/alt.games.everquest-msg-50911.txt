Not sure about this one but I have seen some that say lvl 1-50 in a week.
Not that hard really, if you can play 24/7.  Lvl 1-5, any newbie zone,
couple of hours.  5-10 orc hill in Gfay.  10-15 Nybright sisters in Lfay.
15-20 HighPass.  20-32 HighKeep.  32-40 LowerGuk (can stay longer but too
many trains for effective lvling).  40-50 guard killing.

To give you an example I went from 22-39 in four weeks playing about 6 hours
a day just in HighKeep and Lower Guk.  But I was dying a bit too.  First
rule of PowerLevelers - NEVER DIE, even if you have to make everyone else
die to do it.  Frankly, most PLers are just plain selfish.  I advanced so
fast in lvl because I had holidays at the time, but I didn't compromise good
grouping techniques and consideration of others to do it.  And PLers
generally find it hard to maintain all skills maxed too.  Take my advice,
enjoy the game and take it easy, you will see so much more and learn so
much, and have more fun.
