There are a number of advantages.

As others have mentioned, the mob won't dodge, parry, riposte... I don't
think that their AC drops, unfortunately, but the effect is the same, your
blows land more often.

When a mob turns on you, you'll be readily able to tell.  This means that
if you are ping ponging a mob, it will be clear to everyone what it
is doing.  With SOW or Snare, even straight melee's can ping pong,
follow the mob and beat on it while your buddy stays out of arms length
in front of it, when it turns on you you back off and your buddy does the
same.  Alternately, if you are a combat cleric like me, everyone knows
that something went wrong and they need to get the mob off the crazy
healer who shouldn't have been in there swinging anyway!

Disadvantages:

Rogues can -only- do their backstab from this position.  If at all possible,
position other party members in such a way as to get the mob to turn its
back to the rogue if you have one, don't hog that spot for yourself.

Certain DD spells (and arrows) require a direct line of sight to the target.
If you surround the target you may be blocking line of sight
