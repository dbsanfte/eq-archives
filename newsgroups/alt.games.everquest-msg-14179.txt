In shocking news today, Sony Online Entertainmed has decided to ban
every single player, from the popular game Everquest, for using what
the company calls an "exploit".  It seems that players can stack
multiple items on top of each other, and not cause additional weight
with there characters.  In a prepared statement, SOE said, "It was the
players' responsibility to report an obvious bug like this.  They
could have easily put the items into seperate slots in their inventory
and had the weight distributed as it was intended.  All these players
are obviously cheating, and will loose their accounts because of it."

In other news, millions of people presumed dead have turned up at
schools and work after being missing for months and for some years.
Although police are still unsure of exactly why they were missing for
so long, they think it is somehow tied to a new drug, evercrack, which
is known to cause paleness of skin, insomnia, and memory loss in its
users.
