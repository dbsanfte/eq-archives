You had best check with your group.  Period.  When I recently went through 
HHK as an untwinked newbie, that "not much plat" you saw, was the most 
plat I had access to at my level.  I was quite annoyed with the 
twinked tanks who thought, since it's "not much plat", they should just 
loot as soon as it hits the floor, and /autosplit should be good enough to 
keep the casters happy, if they even felt like bothering with letting me 
have the measly coppers that provides.

4-5pp a mob is, for some, quite a bit of plat.

Pickpocketing is fine, if you're ML and doing a split afterward.  But 
plain and simple,  CHECK WITH YOUR GROUP.  Otherwise, you perpetuate the 
bad name of rogues as a class.
