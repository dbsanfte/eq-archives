All of yall are missing the point ... let me help you:

"Some time in the near future we plan to introduce recipes for the creation
of certain spells for the priest classes. Intelligence casters can use their
research skill to create these priest spell scrolls"

This is what the post was about. Now Mages, Chanters, Wizzies and Necros can
use our research skill to create Cleric, Druid and Shaman spells.

Suddenly, research becomes a tradeskill, as now I can charge the quad kiting
fools an arm and a leg for things they need that I make.
