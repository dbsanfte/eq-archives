Hey Wes,

I went to LOIO at 18 for my Troll SK.  Any advice on this zone?



For Igno,

Feerrott is good for early levels.  Stay near zone for safety.  Should be
alot of good stuff running around, you may have just had a bad night.  Swamp
is a little tougher as the NPC's there can be rude, but you are accepted by
the trolls.  About lvl 8 or so, head to area around Cazic Thule in Feer.
Lizzies there are tougher and good exp at that level.

I have a friend who I group with who plays an Ogre warrior.  He kinda half
roleplays him, which winds up being more convienent.  When we are talking
logistics, he doesn't role play... when fighting or just wandering he does
the "me wanna bash" type of stuff.  I find most groups get a kick out of
troll or ogre roleplay if done properly.  "Me butt itchy... musta sat on
dwarf".

Can be useful if you screw up, like get lost or a bad pull... just roleplay
your low intell and you should be fine.  "Me not find zone... me gonna sit
and cry" (just don't piss anyone off).
