    Hardly. It seems fair to me.

>Let's see, you selflessly
>respond to every request for a rez or whatever all day long...

    Not correct. I FIELD every request for a res. If I'm busy, or I just
don't feel like doing it, I say no. It's really quite easy to do - "You buff
plz?" "No." "Can u come res me in TD?" "I'm sorry, but my time online is
booked solid enough that I cannot spare the time to go to TD." SO simple.
And if everyone was un-anon, I bet that guy in TD wouldn't be asking the
cleric in EC or EK to come help him - he'd be able to find a more local
cleric, one that might really be tempted by the offer of 2000 plat and a
diamond (this was offered to me last night, BTW). But because so many people
are terrified of saying "no", of having to put someone they wouldn't want to
group with ANYWAYS on /ignore if they start getting heat, then all the
requests go to the few people who aren't anon. People like me. And we get
tellbombed, let me tell you.

>but if someone happens to be anon,

    Nobody HAPPENS to be anon. It's a concious choice. You decide you don't
want to get random tells. Don't expect me to have any respect for your
random tells to me.

>you decide, basically, since they don't
>play the same way that you do, well, fuck them, basically.

    Yup. They want help when they don't help others and make the server a
happier place, well, they can pay for it. Through the nose. Or just be
/ignored, if they're truly obnoxious - although I don't reserve that for
just /anon folks that are obnoxious.

>who gives a flying fuck if the person you're helping is sick of getting
>twenty requests an hour from some idiot in the zone wanting a clarity
>or SoW and wants them to come to him and do it for free....

    Say "no", if they persist /ignore idiot. Works like a charm. Again - if
they're knobs, when will you ever want to interact with them again anyways?
What are people so afraid of here?

>he
>certainly deserves no help, the filthy pig. What the hell does that
>have to do with your helping <him> when he needs it?

    You can be a part of the solution - spreading the work load around the
server, and letting knobs see that it isn't just that one caster that
doesn't like how they act - or you can be part of the problem, making people
artificially desperate because they only see three people anywhere online
that can help them. Even though we both know that there's many more high
level clerics than that on.
