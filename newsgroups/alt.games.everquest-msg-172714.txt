Huh?  I never said anything about role-playing.  I haven't seen a
role-player on Povar (other than myself) for years.

You're attacking the use of diminutives as "superficial".  Even if we accept
the connection, why does it detract from the fantasy world?  Because all
characters in a fantasy world are deep and serious?  That's what I'm saying
is unimaginative.

That's a different argument.  OK, why is the use of nicknames and
diminutives out of place for a fantasy setting?

Well, there you have them.  Most people don't understand why you dislike
nicknames.

And if they used a term like "sage practitioner of the occult arts", would
they not also be trying to sound cool?

My experience is different.  I used the term "shammy" today and it was a
conscious decision not to say "shaman".  I used it to convey familiarity.

I've given you several.

If you don't care what others think of you, why stimulate civilized
discussion?  Why help people?

You're changing topics again.  We were talking about looking and sounding
cool while killing stuff.

I previously said "everyone", including "those", "you" and "me".

Only if every player suppresses a grammatic technique common to every spoken
language.  I don't consider that easy, and I don't understand your desire
for it.
