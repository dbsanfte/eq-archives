Its now possible to sell containers in bazaar (on test). Its a bit of
a nifty little trick actually - you give the bag to a certain
barbarian NPC, she gives you a coin, you sell the coin normally on
your vendor, the coin is redeemed by the buyer for the bag.

Nice change. Doesn't alter the fact that some of my guild's officers
are dipshits, of course, but still a nice change.
