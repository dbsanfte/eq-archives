Also get a bind at the bank.  The SoW and Invis are very important, between
FV and the LOIO zone along the river are level 30+ druid spiders and
sometimes an Iksar Necro named Vekis - who killed my level 24 pally sis with
1 DoT.  With a SoW and invis though the journey is quite safe, I have often
done it with invis only and not had a problem - including one time when I
walked right past Vekis.

Once in LOIO go to the Windmill - that's a great place to start out.

Good hunting,

Lex
