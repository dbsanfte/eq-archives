Actually, of the disciplines, defensive is the one for which this is most
untrue.   It lasts 3 minutes and has a reuse time of 10 minutes at level 60.
It is available for every fight, and will last most of the way through a lot
of the targets I was figting.

True.   But whatever the knight can tank, the warrior can tank with less
gear.   Unless you're getting ubertwinked by a more advanced guild than the
one you are starting, that really has to be a consideration.
