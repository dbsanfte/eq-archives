Majority of high level chars are guilded, within these guilds are shamen. My
guild offers members the potions at cost to make price so I always have 4 10
shots in stock for personal use. The same goes for my jewelcraft, I make all
jewelrrey for the guild at cost price.

Many times I have been caught short and have bought SoW potions from people,
a lot of times i have bought in FV.. I also bought 6 stacks of componenets
for one new to alchemy shamen and gave them to him to make potions for me,
he failed a lot and i ended up with 2 10 shots.

SoW potions are a luxury, people buy them for when they are alone in the
field with no friendly sower around. Keep trying to sell but like most trade
skills it is becoming increasingly difficult to make any form of profit
