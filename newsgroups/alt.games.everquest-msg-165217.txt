Yes, and if you want to read your [x,y] as you would on a graph you
not only have to transpose the first and second coordinates, you have
to orient the map so that west is towards the top of the page (as
the printed PoK map in the PoP handbook).

In the new UI, if you have Sense Heading at 200 skill your compass never
wavers, it is very convenient.  And before you reach 200 skill, the
compass settles for about 3 or 4 seconds on every success with Sense
Heading, plenty of time to get yourself pointed more or less exactly in
the direction you wish to go.

I used to do this all the time, the precision of the text you get from
Sense Heading is not good, the compass in the new UI is a very big
improvement.
