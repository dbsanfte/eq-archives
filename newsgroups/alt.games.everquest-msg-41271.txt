    And a big fat "me too".  I not exactly a political activist,
and I've never been what could be called a war monger.
  Still, I feel that our respose should one that, should have
the effect that for generations to come, any extremist that 
brings up the notion of coordinating a terrorist act on the
USA would motive his or own people to immediatly slit his 
throat.  Not out of a sense of moral indignation, of course,
but rather self preservation.  
   The nations that produced and harbored this monsters should
come to regret this day to the same degree that we do.
