You don't count.  Anyone prudish enough to petition random people because
*you* are eavesdropping isn't interested in being cute.  I'd go so far as to
use the term asexual, but mostly because I enjoy the thought of how you
might react to that descriptor.


> Being cute?  no clue what you mean by that.

I knew it.  See, the trick is, you don't actually qualify as female, even if
you do have a hole between your legs.  :P

And ya know, I don't actually agree with what the other guy said.  I just
like to annoy prudes that feel it is their duty to impose their morals
and/or beliefs on everyone around them.  I'm sure my reference to the hole
between your legs was good for a few points of blood pressure.
