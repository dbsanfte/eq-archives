Yeah.  It would've been so much more fun for MF to get killed too.
Oh wait, isn't there a level differential limit for PvP?  So nothing
would've happened differently.  Unless, of course, the jerk had brought
along a few mid-30s to gank anybody foolish enough to be xp'ing in the
area, then MF and his buddy could've been killed.  What fun.
