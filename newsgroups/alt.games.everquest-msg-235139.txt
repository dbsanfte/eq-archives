I dunno... the SOE access pass gives you EQ1, 2 and Planetside... if
your interested in all 3 it might be worthwhile.

I plan to play EQ1 and enjoy it until EQ2 and WoW are available... I'm
hoping to see beta access for both but if not I'll wait until the
initial prices drop a bit, the launch issues/bugs have been sorted out
and then maybe give them a go. If I like either more I'll quit EQ.

Will I regret the time I wasted in EQ? No. I play EQ on a day to day
basis. I'm not one of those people who will waste months playing a
doing something boring or irritating so that "one day I'll be uber and
finally enjoy the game"... because that day never comes... they'res
always another expansion, another item, another carrot. 

I want to get those carrots too, but I'm not going to sacrifice
enjoying today to get there. And if EQ2 comes out and I want to switch
I'll switch with no regrets because I got my moneys worth out of EQ1.

I know a lot of people who haven't yet... having spent *all* their
time bored to tears powerlevelling and farming greens for cash that
'can't switch' because they've 'invested all this time into eq and
haven't got their returns yet'... i feel sorry for them. :p

Also, for what its worth, Scott is right, splitting your time can be a
waste-o-cash. Particularly between WoW, EQ1, and EQ2 which are all
variations on the hack/slash/level mmorpg. Myself, I'm debating trying
out EVE because its different enough that I might want to fool with
both...  but your progress in each will be half what it could be, and
your fees are doubled... but if you enjoy it and can afford it, then
its worth it. Just don't get suckered into subscribing for games you
barely/don't play. You can always cancel and come back.

Personally I'm hoping WoW/EQ2 are good enough that I won't feel
compelled to two box to make progress. That right there will save me
enough to fund my EVE experiment ;)
