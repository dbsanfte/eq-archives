Frankly, for the GM to offer you this last name instead was insulting.
You requested something unusual and interesting, and she counters with
something out of a dimestore fantasy romance novel?

If you'd wanted a name like Steelheart, you certainly could have
handled that without her help.

You're right - being told repeatedly to read the policy wasn't very
helpful of her. It leaves me with the strong impression that she
doesn't really know the policy herself.

>Does anyone see anything that would make this against policy?

The only thing that I see is what others have mentioned - the 'd'
being (incorrectly in this case) seen as a variant on 'the'. If
'Aigle' were an English word, then maybe her reaction would be valid,
but it's not.

>Should I just wait for another GM?

Yes, absolutely.

You could try sending a request upstream with email, but I'd strongly
caution against it - it could backfire and you end up losing this name
on all your characters.
