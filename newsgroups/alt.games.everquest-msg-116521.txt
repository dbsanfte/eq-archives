Don't symbol 'em.  There are very very few exp camps where the
tanks all "need" a symbol.  As in exp'ing in Veeshan's Peak or
something :-).

If you're doing froggies at disco, who gets hit enough to _need_
symbol? Really?  If you're doing Juggs as an exp group, I'll gladly
chunk some cash at you for the extra hps, but sitting in the
basement in Karnor's Castle or running around in Skyfire or
smacking HS mobs, the only reason you might _need_ symbol
is if you have lower level tanks (who get hit more), tanks in gear
that's not up to snuff (as in level 60 warrior in crafted BP) for the
area they're in, or simply because the tanks demand it and you
give in to them.

Try a few pulls without it.  It's not like the first time I snuck past
some pasty-faces in Maiden's Eye that ended up not only
seeing invis, but lifetapping when they meleed.  If you're exp
grouping, you generally know what the mobs can do and what
your party can do.  Generally anywhere you'd NEED symbol
to survive is too tough to be an efficient exp grind anyways.

Raids or shooting for specific mobs for specific loot are NOT
included in this.  Hell, even a level 52 rogue can use symbol
or any other buff when fighting an old-world dragon like Trak
just because of the AoE contributing to damage (hard to
evade Naggy's breath weapon ;-)  ).  I'm simply talking about
pulling blue mobs one after the other as an exp grind.
