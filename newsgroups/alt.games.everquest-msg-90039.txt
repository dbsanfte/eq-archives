I had a friend once who is a gnome chanter, and got stuck behind a barrel at
the North Qeynos gate. He petitoned and waited, until I told him to illusion
out. He was around level 20 at the time, and thought illusions were only
that... illusions, and didn't change your charatcer. I told him to do it
anyway (I knew what would happen). He illusions to an Erudite, and Voila!
He's able to jump out.

I still mess with him for that one.
