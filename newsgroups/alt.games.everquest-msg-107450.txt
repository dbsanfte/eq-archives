Its come to my attention that hybrids need more exp to level. Why the hell
is that ? If a group of friends start together, any hybrids will fall behind
the others gaining less exp. Hence in the long run, the hybrid won't level
as fast. Imagine a beastlord whos pet steals exp like crazy. Twofold exp
problem, pet steals exp and as a hybrid gains less exp. I think that sucks.
I wouldn't have started a beastlord if I knew these restrictions on the
char. Not to mention , verant in its wisdom ( sarcastically ) forces players
to group because there are few creatures a player can solo.
