	Lol.  That didn't matter, because they only dropped on raids or 
their components or turn ins were very very rare.  Remember RGC before you
could get it from LDONs?  How about...Blessing of the 9? Or Funeral Pyre?
Or Hand of Virtue?

>OOW changed all that.

	The rune system sucks.  That being said, almost every RSS named 
is single groupable by a reasonable group so you certainly don't have to
raid to get them.  And now they're all tradeable anyway.

	Well, you're wrong.  Spend some time in Crescent Reach.  Lots
of people running around, lots of traffic in /ooc... Just like any old
newbie zone used to be.  I don't see too many full groups of level 10's
or whatever but I do see a lot of duo's and trio's and hear "Level 7 cleric 
LFG"...

	I know I have a necro who's kited to 72 and even he's starting to
get unsolicited offers for groups.  TSS may have put a stake in the heart
of the old-world newbie zones but I for one am very happy with the new
zones, the new quests, and the new spells.  The stuff that drops for 
low level folks isn't the +1 quality junk but has stats and focuses (so
you can get upgrades from fighting) and the tutorial actually teaches you
how to play.  I've surely seen more new people or long-absent returnees
in the last 3 weeks then in the last 3 years...
