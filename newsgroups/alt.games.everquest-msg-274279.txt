A national chain who's sole marketing gimmick is the breast innuendo of 
the name Hooters. (Oh wait, you are probably the only person on the 
planet who thought it was about owls...)

Meant to be equally offensive, you should have said. And it was.

A cock when placed on a shirt under a rooster has clearly provided 
adequate context to identify the literal usage of the word for the bird. 

Sure the girls were relying on people to sieze up on the double meaning, 
that was rather the point.... Of course so does Hooters....

This from the hooters website:

"The chain acknowledges that many consider "Hooters" a slang term for a 
portion of the female anatomy. Hooters does have an owl inside its logo 
and uses an owl theme sufficiently to allow debate to occur over the 
meaning's intent. The chain enjoys and benefits from this debate. In the 
end, we hope Hooters means a great place to eat."
