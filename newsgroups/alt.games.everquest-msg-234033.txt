Not that I disagree with your point, but I sold a pair of GEB's
(assuming you do mean Golden Efreeti Boots?) for 4900pp (or maybe it
was 4500?)  just last week, so that's a poor example for The Tribunal,
at least. Of course maybe they were up to 10k at some point on
Tribunal, I haven't played the bazaar long enough to know.

It is now possible to get gear that would have had the most uber of
ubers drooling before the Planes (the original ones) were released,
for hundreds of plat a piece. Very little stuff from the original game
is still worth much of anything, mostly haste items.

And with spiderling silks selling for 10-15pp each, getting money
without being high level has never been easier, either.

High end stuff, on the other, will only get more expensive as more
money enters the economy, as it does with or without bugs, unless SOE
can come up with something exceedingly clever. The casino might do it,
but I doubt it.
