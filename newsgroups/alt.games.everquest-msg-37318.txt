> The only true Americans are the Indians.

I read somewhere that archaeologists have discovered evidence of
civilizations in America that predate those of the Indians.  The story goes
like this: The original archaeological diggers dug and found old Indian
artifacts; the diggers then concluded that nothing more was to be found; new
diggers have since unearthed more from beneath those old Indian sites.  I
have no idea if this is true or not but, historically, most nations have
been formed by groups of people who staked out a territory and committed
varying degrees of genocide on the previous inhabitants.  Stands to reason
the Indians could have been just as guilty of that as the European invaders
were.
