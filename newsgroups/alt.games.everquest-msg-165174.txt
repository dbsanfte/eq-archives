You have the whole zone to set up for a temple pull . Dont be anywhere near
where you could ever get pathed onto.

You did the right thing by using an invulnerable person for the initial
pull. However after that you need kiters . 2 or 3 people kite the mobs
around and peel off from each other. Whoever has the least mobs at the
moment takes them back to the camp and then comes back for more :)

Good pulling uses more than just one person . You should have a pulling
group in a raid not just a single puller.
