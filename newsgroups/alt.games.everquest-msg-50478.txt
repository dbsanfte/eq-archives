I was trying to put it in terms that most people understand.  "Balance"
seems out of the grasp of some people, unfortunately.  From what I have
seen, most people look at all balance issues as a Nerf ( if it effects them
adversely ).  I used to be on the Balance Committee on a MUD years ago, and
the whining -never- stopped if anything changed that made something a little
harder for them, no matter how unbalanced it was.  Sad.

So.... any idea on the answers to the questions above re: Necros and
situations?
