Yet you did feel the need to berate someone who did get frustrated
over the top by it, people who may have been affected far more than 2
mornings this month.

Marginally... you'll see the patch on the 11th didn't make the site.
Planning around the site is almost pointless... at best it gives you a
few hours extra notice some of the time. People who dont experience
the patches first hand don't even know how many there are... you can't
rely on the site as a log, and sometimes they dont even change the
patch message they send a system-wide an hour in advance, and 3 hours
later its back up without a word.

Lucky  you then; I haven't gotten an uninterrupted session in over a
week. (They patched 10th, 11th, and 12th this week at least as far as
i know) And this weekends out for RL fun... if they patch again like
this next week I won't see a productive day for half a month... your
'2 days' of issues could be a welcome improvement.

And its not baseless whining. SOE should rotate the patch times, that
would be fairer to all parties. Unless you care to dispute that
point...

Er this *is* the a.g.e ng... I'd rather see a post lamenting SOEs
patch schedule than one about their mom's bout with cancer. 

One really ought to be grateful people don't 'whine' about their
houses, diseases, and explosions here.
