Actually, saves increasing by level is the exception, not the rule in EQ.
Warriors slowly gain magic resistance as they level, and Rogues slowly gain
poison resistance as they level.  As far as I know, those are the only two
cases where this happens.

The general rules for resistances is that they will come from your gear.  As
you start getting better items, you'll notice they tend to have more saves
on them.  There are some lower level items with good resistances, but you'll
generally have to hunt for them.  It's not until upper levels that they
start becoming common.
