I was recieving the same error with my Radeon 7500 when I bought it.  What I
ended up doing was uninstalling Win2k, formatting the hard drive, doing a
fresh install of windows, then immediately(before patching, etc) installing
my ATI drivers.  This seems like a whole mess of hassle.  But apparenltly
one of the windows security updates, doesn't like ATI's drivers.  I have
recently installed XP on my system, and had no problem installing the
drivers at that point, updating on the other hand is a totally different
story.  So you may wish to give that a shot.
