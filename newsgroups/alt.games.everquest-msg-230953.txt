I like the water falls in the game:

Stonebrunt has a nice one.

Plane of Growth, cool looking mobs here also.

East Karana Waterfall was my fist 'WoW!' EQ moment.
The ramp in EK also has some cool looking wall carvings.

Here are some other sights I remember when I stopped
to just gawk at them.

Ssraeshza Temple has some really cool art and achitecture.

Windmills in Steamfont are cool.

The Frozen Goblin King in Permafrost.

One of the LDoN Tak dungeons had a cool female
Sand elf statue.

The glowing skulls in befallen.

The day-glo ultraviolet art in Neriak. That city is like a
twisted Disneyland.

Burning woods the giant wasp nest there.

The giant statue in Everfrost.

Entrance to Kaladim in butcherblock.

The giant staircase in the Emerald Jungle.

The Giant elven ship that runs to Firiona Vie.

The giant statue of Firiona Vie herself.

The velium crystals in Crystal Caverns.

The Glowing Runestones in Dawnshroud.

The Giant wizard spires in Mons Letalis.

The ancient Combine city the in the Dreadlands.

The citys of Skyshrine and Sanctus Seru are just giant
zones that are cool to explore. Its a shame these beuatiful
zones are not utilized very much.

The entrance to sleepers tomb in Eastern wastes.

The gnome icebraker ship that goes to iceclad.

The froglok villiage in the swamp of no hope.

The flame tower in Lake Rathetear.

The bridge across the chasm in Torgiran mines.
