This is the point of the short science fiction story "Flash Crowd",
by Larry Niven.  (It can be found in the collection of his stories
in the volume, "The Flight of the Horse".)

Teleportation booths have been invented -- go into one, dial
the number of another booth anywhere on earth, and *zap*, you're
there.

The downsides quickly become apparent, however.  Any event of national
or worldwide interest suddenly gets jammed with hundreds of thousands
of gawkers, almost exactly like the way in which a nationally publicized
internet website becomes overrun with traffic and crashes from the load.

Worse, sites of unrest become flooded with people wanting to
add to the violence, and/or take advantage of it.  Imagine how
bad the Los Angeles riots would have been if everyone on the planet
who felt aggrieved by the verdict in the Rodney King trial had
been able to punch a few buttons and go join the riots.

Remote sites of pristine beauty (like Tahiti) get overrun with
weekend tourists.

And so on.
