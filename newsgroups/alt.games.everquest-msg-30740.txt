One of my worst EQ memories is from HHP, and they tank wasn't good at
noticing if a mob was on me. He was yelling HEAL PLZ and I was yelling
GET IT OFF SO I CAN HEAL. When I died, he didn't notice. After he zoned,
he started ranting about clerics who can't do their job. I said, "I
can't heal you when I am DEAD!" and hit disband. I was so mad, I didn't
play that character for a week. He's still on my Norezforjoo list.

It does my heart good to see people mourn their clerics.
