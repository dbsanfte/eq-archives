I thought I would just include in this discussion the modification made to 
2h weapons a year or so ago:

"2h weapons with delay under 28 had their damage bonus reduced. Weapons 28 
to 39 stayed the same, with those 40 and above getting an increase."

It occurs to me that a lot of those highend 2h weapons have ratios like 31 
dam 38 delay.  This would put them just under that threshold of 40... would 
a 31/40 weapon be better than 31/38 then?  (I ask having no idea what the 
above 40 delay bonus is.)

Now, a good way to show why 2h is currently bad is to look at the extreme 
example of the "A Weighted Axe".  With 45 damage, it has the highest damage 
I'm aware of in the game, as well as the longest delay at 150.  It's just 
great when you hit with it, especially if double attack goes off (not to 
mention a crit or a crip!)  But when you miss, you're looking at 300 time 
without doing any damage at all, and that is an eternity in which the tide 
of the battle can turn.  Scale this down to typical 2h weapons versus 
typical 1h weapons, and you will see that the reason 1h weapons are better 
is simply that you get more chances to hit successfully with them, and that 
the 2h bonuses applied as mentioned above were not sufficient to offset 
this disadvantage.
