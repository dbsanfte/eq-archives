	Of course it is.

	25-30 years ago, planners said "if we don't build more power plants now,
we're going to have a crisis in the 21st century."  It's the 21st century, and
we're entering a crisis.  We not only did not build the nuclear plants, we
didn't build ANY new power generation capacity in most (possibly all) areas of
the country.  So we have more people than ever with more electrically-powered
gizmos than ever trying to use the same amount of power.  It doesn't work --

	Common knowledge is usually neither.
