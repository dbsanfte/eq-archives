Why not?  You could be a trend-setter!  Just think.. everybody who thinks
your cool would rush out to copy you, and before you know it, neon green is
the "new cool look"

hehe. well, people only say it to be mean to me :(  (in a friends teasing
kind of way)

All because of this stick ---> http://www.mas.ukshells.co.uk/eq/meem1.jpg
If only Tunare realised how much pain and misery her stick has inflicted
upon me, god of all things good?  pfft to me shes as evil as innoruk!

I suppose I could equip my primal bat -->
http://www.mas.ukshells.co.uk/eq/meem2.jpg and club them over the head!
this makes my bubbles show too :)

They don't show up too great here, but I like flashy things! (fist wraps in
both slots) --> http://www.mas.ukshells.co.uk/eq/meem3.jpg

Post a piccy of you plz.. preferably in neon green!   :)
