it's easier than Dalnir 2 if you are of the correct level.  Moving on to
your more detailed info....

Yup, he'll eat them alive.  There's no way in hell they'll get xp for it
unless you have a LOT of healing support.  Most likely the angel group will
have to KS pretty quickly.  Keep in mind that I've had to evac out twice
with my low 50s druid and low 50s enchanter because I either started out
with low mana or ignored the wanderers.  The chancellor isn't a wimp.
Underestimating him is death, and if you stick that baby group in there to
get slaughtered I just hope you also have at least a 29 cleric there to
revive.  Your higher level group shouldn't have much trouble, but don't
think you'll get away without at least a few heals.  I doubt you'll be able
to heal the kids fast enough.

Full house.  Maybe 10-12 spawn?  Most are static and far apart, so if you
have a high level puller you should be able to single pull.  If any of the
20s or 30s pull, I have no idea what'd happen.

No clue.  I've killed him maybe a dozen times farming Howling Stone key
components for my alts and guildies.  I killed some guy next to him once
that dropped some lameassed book that procs Cancel Magic...ON YOU.  Though I
CAN think of a time or two when that'd be a little handy, I did quickly
destroy the bugger.
