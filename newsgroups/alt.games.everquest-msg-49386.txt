One thing that can really help you get through levels 1-5
rather painlessly -- find a higher level character and ask them,
very nicely and politely, if they could please "buff" you.

Clerics and Paladins and Rangers and Druids are especially good
for this.

Many types of high-level characters can cast spells on you
which will temporarily (5-60 minutes, typically) significantly
boost your armor, your total hitpoints, and other useful stats.

A level-30 buff that only helps another level 30 character by
5% may well multiply a level 2 character's hitpoints by 800%,
for example, making you king of the newbie area for a time.
