There is no aggro generating component of the proc, it just gives the usual
aggro for a 179 DD with a 0 second stun.

In my experience as a bard I can't hold aggro with a Great Blade of Storms,
which has the same proc, even if I want to. When I've been grouped with a
rogue and no tank lately (for VT shard camps, not exp) I still don't get
aggro without the right song line up.
