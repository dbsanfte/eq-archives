Sorry, try again.  The following is from eqtraders.com.  You will note the 
absence of jade, ruby, onyx, sapphire, fire emerald, star ruby, pearl, 
topaz, emerald, and opal.

I don't remember which 'various gemstones' Voglan had, but they were in 
line with the others.  The fire emeralds, sapphires, and star rubies can 
be gotten in NFP in the blue building.  For the others, run up to Neriak 
if you have the faction. :)
