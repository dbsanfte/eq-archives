ok a guy in my former guild  had his account banned cause he was letting
other people know his account name and password... now he gets a new account
and the leader of the guild is plvling him like there is no tomorrow and
ignoring everyone else in the guild.. am i am the only one that sees this as
being off kilter somehow?
