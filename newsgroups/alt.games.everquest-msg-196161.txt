I was also not happy with solo exp in Burning Wood, I took way too much of a
beating and had far too much down time even with a KEI and Canni. A friend
of mine (a wizard) learned the fine art of quad kiting there and he kicked
ass soloing.  Alas my poor shaman found that my soloing days were over when
I hit 51.  Or at least the days when soloing was a lovely art form instead
of a drudgery.
