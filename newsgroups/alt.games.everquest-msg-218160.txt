My guess is you bought this char, cause if you had played the char to 65
then you;d know all about where to get money.

however unlike some people in the group i wont hate on you cuz you chose to
spend your money this way.

i cannot advise you on where to get money at 65 cause my highest char is
only 54, and lately I hit highkeep guards and/or dulak. both are
surprisingly empty lately and its easy money. I would think those tier3
planes are probably the best you can go tho, look for spell components or
high end quest pieces that arent nodrop.

it probably wouldnt hurt to roam around those tier1 pop zones and look for
named mobs, if you can solo those they might drop something worthwhile you
can sell. shrug.
