Er, you missed what I was saying, but I was a bit casual on the remark.
The discussion was dealing with whaether parents have control over what
genes are being passed on to their child. Not having a kid isnt exercising
control it is evading the issue. In part the same effect, but not actually
the issue since you were discussing genetic inheritance, which rather
assumes there is an issue to inherit....

My point is they don't, there are too many random events for there to be
anything other than chances. You then introduced the 'I don't breed
therefore I do control this' - by saying the 'if everyone goes that way' I
was trying to point out, badly - OK, that the method you indicated as
control even if perfect is one that if raised from the individual level of
what you have chosen with your life to the level of general use, then the
species would fail - so it isnt a viable option generally.

Further I would contest that it is even a universally useful solution,
since while it may be a good one for you specifically it may not be
approrpiate for all.

For instance we would not have Steven Hawking if this was applied to gene
defects as a whole. Even if you stay within mental and therefore
behavioural issues chop out anyone

Also I feel you overrely on genetic factors anyway, you laid considerable
emphasis on their influence and how they affect people when you don't need
a genetic factor to make the point nor has the genetic factor actually
been measured.

Which can fail in its purpose. Its not perfect. It can also be reversed
potentially (again should ou make that choice it wont happen 100%).

Yes I saw that, but Im discussing the issue of you saying the bad genes
are someone's fault. You made this seperate point out of the context of
environment about genetics, and that was inaccurate. 

When you bring environment back in then you are brigning in a section
that is a different issue to the one that was stated. Also, it skews your
arguent since the parents are not responsible for 100% of the enivronent
and ultimately what you are arguing boils down to a behavioural issue. 

At the point that you cannot accurately assign responsibility for the end
behaviour assigning fault is impossible. And assigning which bit nature,
nurture or self drive is responsible 

> By the way - the first comment I made which you obviously did not read was:

I did read it, you went on to make an erroneous statement later and that
is what Im arguing against. That being a) the issue of blame having a
genetic level which is doesnt have to in the experiences and b) the
fact that you can control what genes are being passed on which you can't.

If you wish; lets go back to the point below which was your first issue.

The problem here is much the same as I had in the sub thread. You make
definitive statement that cannot be made. You define the answer as black
or not. 'Of course it is nothing to do with the parents', you refer this
incidentally to the question of genetics being the kicker so it certainly
looks like the environment is takin the back seat there.

My answer to the above is: these answers are not the black and white you
are laying down (or coming over as laying down if you prefer). Genetics
may or may not play a part, environment may or may not play a part, how
muc contribution the parents have to either ay or may not be either 100%
or the relevant experience or not. Its a mess of grey. Sure I agree that I
think the woman in question is ranting based on a overly simple one way
association (ie he played EQ therefore he shot himself). However if you
demand the grey, the context, the expanded world of experiences Little
Johnny had to make that point that she is being simplistic...you also have
to live with that grey, context, experience et al being in Little Johnny's
world and so the simple association of 'its the parent's fault of course',
which you make, must also fall down.
