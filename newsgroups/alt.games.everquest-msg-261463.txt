If getting from one zone to another used to involve getting on a boat,
you will not be able to swim across.  You will get to the edge of your
zone and then, as you saw, you stop.  (Much like hitting the edge of a
zone on land.)

Generally, you can still get from the starting dock to the destination
dock by talking to a "translocator", also called a "boat gnome" for
obvious reasons. :-)  Hail the gnome on the dock and follow the text
instructions to get him/her to transport you to the other zone.

As for Sirens, I haven't heard of Sirens huntable at those levels, but
I don't claim to know all the zones by any means.
