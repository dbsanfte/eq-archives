I zone into WC tonight. Before I even move off the landing point,
"Kudelanthehated" is directly in my face. I move well back from the
landing point, maybe 10 yards. He follows, right in my face.

Kudelanthehated says, 'Hail'
You say, 'what?'
Kudelanthehated says, 'could you buff me up please?'
You say, 'No, and get a real name.'
Tooldog says, 'now that was so helpful'
You say, 'I'm not paid to help people who don't bother to read the
game rules.'
Tooldog says, 'your not paid to be rude either'

(Rude? That wasn't rude!)

You say, 'No, I do that for free. It's a hobby.'
Tooldog says, 'your good at it LOL'

(Better fucking believe it, fella.)

You petition, 'name violation KUDELANTHEHATED'
