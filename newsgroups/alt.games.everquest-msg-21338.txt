If youre a monk, be SURE to buy Fuzzlecutters Formula 5000, from Ping
Fuzzlecutter just outside WFP gate.
Its an enduring drink, and last over 2 times longer than Fish Rolls (cant
remember is they are hearty or banquet), and only weight the same as normal
water.
True, they cost a little more, i pay almost 7pp for a stack, but i have drink
for several life days of playing on 1 stack.
