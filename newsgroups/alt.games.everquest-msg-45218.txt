Just a suggestion but one that works for me when i play my shaman and the
shaman who is my druid's partner, don't sit in a zone and auction, while
your hunting send out an auction now and then, when people ask you for a sow
or ask if they can buy a sow off you ask them if they are interested in
buying some potions as well. I don't do much alchemy with my shaman anymore
since I have pretty much retired her but when i play my druid the shaman i
hunt with is selling potions as fast as he can make them because this is the
method we use, they aren't even trivial to him yet so he is only breaking
even when he sells them but is now at the point he is getting tells from
people he has sold them to out in the field who want more and know he is
avail to make them. Sitting in a zone auctioning by the hour will wear you
out extremely fast, that is how I started doing mine and learned quickly i
was wasting time. Also make some invis to undead potions and head to places
like lower guk to hunt and auction while there, that is where I made most of
my money, off itu's not sow's.
