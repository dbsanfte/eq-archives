Ya know, go ahead and laugh at PB's...my first PC, after years of using
Mac's in school labs (aside from VAX terminals) - was a 486DX2-66 PB - 4MB
hard-wired RAM and 20MB HD.  On-board video (256k?) and 2400/9600 modem/fax.

Tried running OS/2 -2.1 on that puppy and it just flat choked it, when it
finally loaded the OS 20 minutes later.  Paid over $250 for a 4MB stick to
get it up to 8MB and OS/2 ran beautifully.

Anyway, the point of the story - I ran stuff more easily, like games and
apps heh, on this thing than alot of my buddies with home-built 486's with
16MB of memory and WAY better video cards.  Everyone else was having driver
issues or whatever and I'd be calling around looking for someone to play
modem-modem Doom with.
