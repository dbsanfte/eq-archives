We went from a fixed price DKP system to a bidding system.

Fixed price sucked.  There needs to be some kind of itemiser (we used an
excel spreadsheet) to keep prices in track with each other.  The item was
broken down into hp/mana, focus, and effect.

New zones and new expansions make the early exploration days difficult
because there is no marker to set new loot prices, it requires massive time
to create a price list amongst current and future targets, that also needs
to be updated when zones are revamped, items are changed, or new zone access
is achieved.

Theres also massive rot, who wants to pay <high flat rate> for a 20hp
upgrade?
Sure, going from <trash> to that item is good value, but when you are going
from an item slightly below it, your value for money is horrendous.  So as a
result, we personally had massive loot rot.  From day 1 of plane of time to
the final day of our fixed price system, we had rot from phases 1-5 (all bar
Quarm)

Fixed price is gay.

We moved onto tier based bidding.
Items are broken into tiers (this is dependent on your level.. we use
160-180hp, 180-220, and 220-260hp tiers.  There are very few exceptions to
this, and for the most part it matched plane of time tiers (phase 1-4 was
tier 1, phase 5 was tier 2, and phase 6 was tier 3).  Since we beat Uqua,
farmed Qvic, and beat Inktu'ta, the standard hp item the guild was winning
significantly raised.  So again for us personally, phases 1-5 in plane of
time are tier 1, phase 6 (quarm) is tier 2, and Uqua+ is tier 3.

The reason for tiers is to set bid ranges and required attendence. We have a
minimum and maximum bid.  So.. :-

Tier 1 bids range from 1-40 DKP (no attendence req.)
Tier 2 bids range from 10-50 DKP (40% req. attend)
Tier 3 bids range from 20-50 DKP (40% req attend)

Reason for min and max bids is a few things really.. its a small safeguard
against gay classdeals (any dkp system will have this), and its a safeguard
against people going crazy.  Bid systems have a downside of allowing price
gouging, the ability to hike others prices and generally fuck with them. So
we have a "safeguard" against people going crazy too.  I think we have our
tiers pretty much spot on.. rot loot is very very rare now, because of
course with incorrect tier prices rot could still be high.

In our old system most loots were priced 20-30, with few exceptions being
less or high. Now with bidding, most loot goes for way less, under 20. But
the top items go for 50, and its a pretty nice balance.

The 40% attendence required for top items is to stop people playing twice a
month, then earning a top vital piece of loot and dissapearing again. If you
play this infrequently.. well your sights should be much lower anyway.

In all cases, when the bid cap is reached, current total DKP is used to
determine the winner.

Bidding is in a public channel, no set increment, and takes 30 seconds or
less.
/gui <item link> <bid amt>
After a break in bidding (we ask people to say pass, when they cease bidding
too), we announce highest name+price as a final call, and a few seconds
later they will be announced as winner if nobody steps up.

Downsides to it:
Class deals, as with all bid systems
Using Saved dkp total to determine winner. This sucked in the old method
too, more so then though, because people who went x-months without loot
could then cherry pick all the top loots at standard prices, and still have
enough of a dkp mass to retain seniority on the next drop (the top x in each
class were very well geared, 4th-rest was a huge gear gap).
It does work much better in the bid system, because no longer does hoarding
a gazillion points give you first dibs on super-duper quarm earing of
uberness for bargain points, now if you want those items, you have to bid
for them. And paying 50 a few times hurts!

We use 0.5/hour for farm raids, and 1/hour for progression raids.

The sections debated when this went live were balancing dkp earned versus
attendence, balancing dkp earned versus points spent, point caps, and
changing the "total dkp saved" winning factor to be dkpsaved + attend *
some_magic_number.. this was because our aims with the new dkp system were
2fold. Firstly, stop mass rot, and secondly try and limit point hoarding to
cherry pick loot.

We still reserve the right to change things (likely step would be a point
freeze, upon which hoarding more would not affect seniority).. but there
hasnt been a need to.  We have very few complaints, very little rotting
loot, and people who hoard at the expense of their gear upgrades and become
a liability on raids.. well this 0.1% can be spoken to and dealt with on a
side issue, rather than making the entire loot system complicated to cover
the extreme 0.1% too.
