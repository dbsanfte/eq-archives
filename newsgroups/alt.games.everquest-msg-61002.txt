Assuming you can equip you and your pet with magic weapons (see your
friendly local mage, 14 or above to summon you some) the only one I can
think of is the GLS quest with the gypsies for the concordance of
research quest. Kill the wisps in east/west commons, collect GLS, take
them to the gypsy and do the quest. You can make eight plat or more a
shot on it.
