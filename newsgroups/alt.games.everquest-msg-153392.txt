I'm not sure if telling you will help anyway.  I was in a pick-up group with
my necro in Paludal Caverns.  We headed out to the second bandit camp.  We
had plenty of fire power for Paludal, 1 Warrior, 2 Beastlords, 1 Wizard, 1
Shaman and me.  That gave us 3 meleers and 3 pets to do damage.  The shaman
let us know he was playing both the shaman and one of the Beastlords (the
one doing the pulling-which was a mistake)  With a group like that we should
have been able to chain pull, instead, this is how it went.  The Beastlord
wanted to med to full before every pull.  ZZZZZzzzzzZZZZzzzzz He pulled
about 3 times and on the 4th pull, overpulled and we had about 4 on us.  I
stood up, attacked one with skellie, but when I looked around to see what
was next, I was the only one there.  Everyone else had run, although there
was no message to run or zone.  I dropped one, and had another down about
half-way before I dropped.  I can't think of a time I've ever been more
pissed off at a group before or since then.  OOOOOH the foul language that
issued nearly reduced my computer to a cinder.  It was all so pointless
because we could have taken them.  Needless to say I ditched the group and
added the Shaman/Beastlord to a very special place on my idiot list.
