Why?   Knights of old didn't travel around the countryside in their
best plate.   They'd wear it when it was appropriate -- entering battle
and/or areas they thought to be dangerous.   Otherwise they'd have their
"good gear" stowed and would be wearing significantly less armor, would
probably be on a "disposable" horse rather than their war-horse, etc.
They could still fight - and were often dressed for it, just not in plate --  
but
they certainly didn't wear their best plate everywhere.
