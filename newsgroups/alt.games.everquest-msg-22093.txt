> You could stop being anal about Loot and have fun playing the game.

Wow -- a semi-flame already and to a perfectly flameless posting.  Jeez.

Anyway, it's not ME that's "anal" about it, but I get tired of the bickering
that happens when someone isn't "running the show" and that's why I usually
end-up doing the loot controlling.

Anyone have any solid input to my question instead of rampant chest puffing?

Mike
