Jeez Louise...overreact much?  This is a game, right?  Supposed to be
fun?  If he thinks it is fun to reduce downtime so he makes the most
of his ingame time, how does this bother you?  If you want to sit on
your ass regenerating for 10 out of every 11 minutes of play, more
power to you.  Go for it.  But don't fault someone else for choosing
another style of play.

For the record, I twink, too.  I don't have a lot of time to play, I
have a life and a job, and it's important to me that I enjoy my ingame
time because I don't get a lot of it.  If KEI and a fungi make my time
more fun, what business is it of yours?

Hitler?  What the hell does a fricking GAME have to do with
*Hitler*???  Pal, you need a reality check...
