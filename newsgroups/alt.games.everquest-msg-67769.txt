Why med before looting your corpses?  I say the only reason not to
loot someone else's corpses is if they are still actively engaged in
combat in close proximity, and therefore obviously just have not had
time to loot yet.

Does that mean that I can plop down in the middle of a bunch of
corpses and med, thereby staking a claim to them if the actuall
players who killed them have left?  If someone else comes along while
I'm medding, don't they have a right to that loot?

When you kill something, loot it as soon as you can.  Outside of that
it is free game.
