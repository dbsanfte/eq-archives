As with other "cultural" skills, like wood elf Hide, you get the skill
at lvl 1 with a degree of skill and it never goes beyond that.  You

only exception I'm aware of to this is the Iksar's natural swimming
ability, which gives them a high degree of skill at lvl 1 but they can
continue to progress in skill by using it.
