Since it's you who are postulating the existence of an entity that is *not* 
necessary in any way to explain available evidence, it's only logical that 
the burden of proof rests on you. If I told you that we're surrounded by 
invisible death monkeys from the planet Zurg, it's obvious that I would have 
to provide proof of their existence if I wanted to convince you, as there 
are no phenomena that cannot be explained without resorting to such monkeys.

Regardless of whether I believe in the soul or not, which is nobody's 
business but mine, I believe that it's obvious that no phenomena in the 
world requires of the existence of the soul for a satisfactory explanation, 
therefore it's down to the believers to offer proof, or at least evidence, 
if they want to be taken seriously in a scientific debate. Of course, if you 
believe in souls because that's part of your religion, I'm perfectly fine 
with that, as long as you don't call it science.

Notice that nowhere in the paragraphs above, or indeed in the previous post 
have I said or implied that the soul doesn't exist. I DON'T KNOW. I'm just 
saying that nobody has presented any convincing evidence so far.
