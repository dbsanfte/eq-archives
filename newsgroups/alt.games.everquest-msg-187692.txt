There probably wont be enough to pull in EW with KEI if you plan on quadding
ulthorks. imo an absolutely brilliant camp at 39 is the spectres in oasis. 8
spawns on a fast timer, and really easy for their con. Good loot, close
vendors, fast fps... who could ask for more? Just harmony one first so you
dont get 5.
