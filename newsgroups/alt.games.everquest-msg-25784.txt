Unnecessary. Simply copy the folder over to the new box, make a shortcut to 
the executable, and voila! EQ.

Verant did the laudable act of Walking The Programming High Ground and 
ignored Windows silly dependence on the registry. They only make one little 
entry, which I believe rebuilds itself. To be safe, you can recreate it by 
copying the following into Notepad, saving the result as eq.reg, and then 
double-clicking eq.reg to install the registry entry:


[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\EverQuest]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\EverQuest\EverQuest]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\EverQuest\EverQuest\1.00.000]

Hope that helps!
