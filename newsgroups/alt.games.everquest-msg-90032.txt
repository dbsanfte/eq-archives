Don't play a monk yet, just watch them a lot with my cleric, so take this
with a grain of salt...

I was under the impression that a successful feign death was the equivelent
of a aggro-reducer, a la the cleric atone or enchanter Memory Blur spells.
IE, it helped you, but not others.  It also doesn't always work on the first
shot.  I know many a monk who, in Karnor's Castle (thank god I don't hunt
there anymore) stands up and waits a few seconds to see if the de-aggro
"stuck" before going and trying to pull again.  I'f seen it not work and the
static mobs come rushing back for him, even though they were clearly out of
aggro range.
