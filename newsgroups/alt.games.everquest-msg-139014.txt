}Its to do with the news server for my ISP its free for me. I refuse to use
}third party news services as they add to my billing. I am on a volume based
}cable plan and its the only way broadband is supplied to residential clients
}in Australia. If your wondering  how much my qouta is its 3000 megs
}upload/download, 10 megabit downstream 128kilobit upstream.

http://groups.google.com .  It is also free, and not much more bandwidth. 
Usually, multiple copies occur when you have to press a 'done' button 
before sending a message, and since the client doesn't react right away, 
you click it a few more times.  You might doublecheck to make sure  you 
aren't doing that.
