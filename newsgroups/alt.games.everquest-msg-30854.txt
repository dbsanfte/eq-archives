After reading this, I may just give it a try. Though I'm not a big PVP fan
(thanks to the early days of UO), some of it actually sounds interesting.
The biggest problem I've had with PVP is the grief players.  If, in fact,
they are few over level 10, then what the hell- I'll give it a shot.

Btw, well said.
