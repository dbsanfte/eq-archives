Enchanter is best - if you like dying so regularly you can set your
clock to it.
Bard is 2nd - if you have wrists of steel, and like "controlled panic".
Necro is safest - if you like "sitting back in a lawn chair and watching
the xp roll in".
Shamen - rate em down here, may be better than Necros in some cases, but
not as safe.

Druid - King of Mowing down large numbers of mobs pre 34.  Bad rep as a
downside.
Wizard - King of Mowing down large numbers of mobs post 34.  

- Justisaur -
Playing my enchanter I have a 1 death a day quota to fill.  If I don't
die at least once a day I'm taking it too easy.  If I die more than 5
times in a day, then it's time for the reality check...
