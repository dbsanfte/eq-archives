No...it's because the stuff that drops for level appropriat MObs is
CRAP...I'm sorry, my level 35 Beastlord does NOT need Fine Steel weapons
(Dalnir), my level 52 Enchanter SHOULD NOT need a group of level 65 players
to get his level 52 Spell: Illusion Guktan, my 37 Ranger does NOT need Fine
Steel weapons (JPF), my 44 Warrior does NOT need Jarsath armor (KC)...etc
etc...

Make the items LEVEL appropriate...if you are fighting a MOb that is nuking
you for 200 a shot and out meleeing you, while you hit at about 60ish a shot
(35 bst in Dalnir), you do NOT need a 30/7 2HB item...(Kly Invoker in
Dlanir).

NOW...also figure in the fact...that if something drops that you CAN
use...you have to win the roll, use DKP, or be lucky enough that NO ONE else
needs or wants it....and MAYBE you can get it.

Basically, regardless of bazaar...the stuff that you can get off things you
can kill is crap...period...
