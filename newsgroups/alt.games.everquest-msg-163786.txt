Just a quick question.  What is the name of the pet focus itemfor necro's?
And what level do you have to be to get it.  I know that with planing I was
able to get my mage items at 20, but i don't play her any more..  I want to
devote my time to the Necro.  You know doing searches I just don't know if
there is such a thing, I have seen people talk about it here, but they never
say what the name is.

Any help would be appresiated.

Omiin
