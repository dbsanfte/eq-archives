VI had 0 care about wandering higher-level mobs in
a lowbie zones.  Witness the number of wandering
Hill Giants and Griffins in West Commonlands, not
to mention Zytl.  Before everybody and their cousin
could holler up a level 50 player (although, at the time,
some level 50's would have been hard-pressed to beat
a HG or Grif) to get rid of 'em in 20 seconds, it was
standard to get waxxed running your level 10 halfling
across the zone.

The LRathe "monster" was named Kraken, and he
was removed because of pathing.  GIANT, GIANT
shark graphic, and he was SOOOO big that he
didn't even really fit in the lake...his pathing took him
up in the air and "through" the dirt in a lot of places.

He was removed around the same time Mayong
was, although he's a different story altogether.
