The main problem with the Amiga was that Commador bought it from the
people that designed it and then came out with the C128 and seemed to
just market the C128 and C64 almost ignoring the Amiga. It was a bad
case of not designed here. I had the Amiga 1000 and then the Amiga
2000. When Commador went belly up and sold the Amiga line it was too
late. /sigh
