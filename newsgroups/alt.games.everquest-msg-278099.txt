I agree with you.  In fact, it's one of the things that has me playing a lot 
more EQ rather than EQ2.

For the record, I've been playing since March 2001 and my highest is 63.

It seems that as a lot of formerly disenfranchised folks (like myself) are 
coming back, and they're coming back to lower level alts.  I came back in to 
a lvl 34 SK (he's 43 now), and I'm having a blast.

What I've noticed since the merge is that the LFG tool yields a lot more 
folks 30 - 60 with their LFG flags on.  Of course there are a lot of 65 - 70 
folks as well, but when I left those level ranges were pretty much all you'd 
find LFG (in fact, that was one of the primary reasons I left).

A lot of the older dungeons seem to be getting a workout nowadays as well. 
There's always folks in LGuk, and when I popped inot SolA it was busy too. 
It's not like it was 'way back when', of course, but spots like that are no 
longer the ghost towns they used to be.

btw, as an aside ... how long did it take them to do your movelog?  I 
movelogged my little shammy on Tribunal several weeks ago, and he hasn't 
shown up yet.
