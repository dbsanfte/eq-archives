If you don't like the transparent inventory, you can uninstall Velious.
This will cause a screen-size change whenever you see the inventory
screen, as that remains 480x600 inside the 800x600 box with a nice black
border. This of course makes it harder to read anything, and is dang
annoying when the screens shift sizes. Plus, you can't go to Velious
then.

Sadly, I think you'll have to get used to it.
