Is it a problem with me or what??

I occassionally come accross such items as thes large looms, I have read
that they are 10 slot??

From memory there is one next to bank in Rivervale?

I remember clicking on this RV loom when I first started but nothing
happened. I never give it much thought until now, as I embark on skilling up
my tailoring.

Now everytime i come accross a loom, i try and click on it, but none have
ever opened.

I assumed they would open like the forges, which I can use......

Do I have to be at a specific skill level before the looms will open?
Do I have to be carrying specific 10 loom articles?
Should I not be carrying a small sewing kit as I try to open the looms?

Thoughts please.
