You beat me to it.

I also happen to feel that Howard Stern has managed to earn his reputation,
and must live with the consequences.  He receives the treatment he does due
to the actions he has taken.  I am in now way belittling what he did
immediately following 9/11, but that does not change the fact that in his
broadcasting career, he has far more frequently offended people, quite
deliberately, in order to provoke shocked reactions.  There is a reason it
is called shock radio.
