I would have to disagree with this one... Starcraft is still quite
actively played online, and I believe Blizzard are still issuing maps.
 I recently got back into it, and it's still an excellent game that
compares quite favorably with  games that have been developed in the
last few years.  I've started playing coop games with folks in my EQ
guild, and also started replaying the standard campaign.

If you haven't played it for a while, you should dust it off, I think
you'll be pleasantly surprised.
