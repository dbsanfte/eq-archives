I think LDoN is an intelligence test for the player base.  I saw people last
night /shouting and /oocing for LDoN groups, and I would bring up the LFG
tool and check, and (1) they weren't listed, and (2) there were groups LFP
in their level range, accepting their class, clearly looking to do LDoN.

With one possible exception, Sony has given the players all we need to set
up the kind of fast grouping game you want, but I think a lot of people are
going to be too dumb to take advantage of it.

The one possible exception is the death penalty.  It's high enough to scare
a fair number of people away from pick-up groups. EQ's death penalty is odd
for groups, in that if you have a high level Cleric, there basically isn't a
penalty, other than waiting for res effects, rebuffing, and regening mana,
but if you don't have a Cleric, then death is major reverse progress,
possibly including loss of level.  I think they need checkpoints every
level, and maybe every half level, that you can't fall below.
