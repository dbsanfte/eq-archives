There is a difference between warrens-style loot rules, and the warrens
loot rules in unmodified form.

What they are proposing for the role-playing server is that there is no
such thing as no drop, so you can always buy quest component from lower
players.

Can't say I like the idea myself, and there are still some loopholes
(such as noone who can zone into hate will be able to loot the level 3
iksar child for the shaman epic).

But thats very different from breaking 50% of the quests in the game -
even Verant are not stupid enough to do that for more than a week or
two.
