Do you honestly get the impression I feel that way?

The comparison I made is simply for the purpose of pointing out he's
oversimplifying into absurdity. A fertilized human egg for example
often gets discarded by women when they suject themselves to lots of
physical exercise after conception. Are you going to argue that they
murdered their own child?

My personal feeling is that a fertilized egg deserves no protection
(legally), and a fetus that has nearly completed development
definitely does. The fist trimester limit seems to make sense to me,
but i'd leave it to medical professionals to decide the exact
point/period.

Also you're comparing a step in human development to a race. Blacks
are by todays definition human beings. We know they always were. I'm
not sure why you would assume I'd use a 200 year old racist
definition. It's a far-fetched attack on my argument at best.

No I would. You're turning the argument around on me. I said abortion
is by definition not murder. That doesn't even touch how I feel about
it, especially late-term abortions.


> Nice semantic argument.  I love semantic arguments.   =P

Yeah so I had a few points in my long argument that were semantic in
nature. But for one I wasn't wrong on the face of it, even if you
don't like it, and secondly this is only a distraction from the
general argument I was making. If you disagree with what I said, why
not reply to the argument as a whole and have a discussion?

I'm not a big fan of semantic arguments myself, but when they are just
sprinkled in with others, I don't mind.
