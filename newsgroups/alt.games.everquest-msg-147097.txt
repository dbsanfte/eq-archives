I think you mean "isn't a mob in EQ" (not nitpicking, just making sure I
understand the statement to respond correctly)

It does however help with dealing with the initial burst of damage, which is
one of the "hardest" parts of most big mob fights.   The main tank crumpling
immediately is a very rough way to start any raid.

I guess it depends on what degree you require for "raid critical."  If you
use a standard of "does it abso-fricking-lutely have to be there for the
raid to succeed", then no.   If you use "Does it make the raid a hell of a
lot easier, to the point where it's considered 'necessary'"
