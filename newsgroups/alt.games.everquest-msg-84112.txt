In all fairness to the cleric, she was facing the wall to kill the lag,
and could just see the Dragon's health bar dropping, slowly but surely,
to the expected kill. Then the shit hit the fan and we took off running
after the suprisingly unrooted, unsnared Dragon. I'd chased him a
country mile down the tunnels, and around a corner into a pack of rats
(without us announcing that he was running) before she even knew what
was happening.
