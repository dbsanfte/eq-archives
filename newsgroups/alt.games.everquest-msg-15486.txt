This is true.  Strangely, however, I get 95% of the sense of 
accomplishment if I finish the mob off myself when a random passerby threw 
me a free heal or buff, but I get no sense of accomplishment when they 
walk up and pound my kill to death.  It just makes me feel like they must 
think I'm some lame-o who couldn't do it herself.

Now, if I have a friend powerleveling me, it's an entirely different 
situation, since I have _asked_ for help.

}Gimme some of what you losers are smoking...

Sorry, dude, you always bogart it.
