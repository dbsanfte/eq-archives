i like to think of it this way:  if a mob is snared, it "thinks" it has a
chance to run because snare only slows down movement rather than stopping it
all together (of course, the low health of the mob also slows down movement,
so usually by the time it runs there is no running actually going on, but
the mob still thinks it can run because technically a snare does not root it
to a single spot and therefore it *should* be able to get away).  on the
other hand, if the mob is rooted it "knows" it has no chance of escape, so
what does it do when there is zero chance of escape?  fight to the death!
That's better than going down like a dumbass with its back turned when there
is no chance of escape!  i guess you could say that's the role player's
point of view on the root/snare thing...
