Sure.  And how often can you double hit for 110s against xp mobs?  And
how reliably can you double for 110s against xp mobs.  And how likely
are you to double for 110s when the fleeing mob is about to turn a
corner and fetch the train?  And what are you gonna do when you're in
your hi 40s and you are hitting at most two-thirds as often as the
warriors/rangers/monks?

Don't brag about the damage you do in melee with a knight class.  You'll
get awful indigestion eating those words when you parse a battle later
in your career.
