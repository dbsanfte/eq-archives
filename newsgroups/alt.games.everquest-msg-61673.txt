My main is a 55 enchanter.  The subject line was sent to me, unsolicited
(ie, I wasn't auctioning anything) in a tell from a 55 druid whom I don't
know in the same zone as me.

I'm assuming it stands for "Where are you?," but I'll never know for sure
because there's no way in hell that I'm going to respond to such a moronic
tell.  It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out why he'd be asking a
level 54+ enchanter where he is, and if he's THAT fucking lazy as to not
even type out full words for the best buff a druid could ever ask for I'm
not going to waste even THAT many letters replying.

Sheesh!
