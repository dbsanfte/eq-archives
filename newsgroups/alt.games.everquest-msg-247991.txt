cheal chain - multiple clerics rotate casting complete heal for the 
duration of the fight. the idea is that a complete heal will land on the 
main tank every few seconds whether he needs it or not (he probably 
needs it :). cheal is quite mana efficient vis a vis other heals but a 
single cleric can't cast it fast enough... so multiple clerics rotating 
it are used.

spash heal - nothing formal... just heal anybody you notice who is 
damaged as they need it, when they need it, including the main tank. 
Sometimes a splash healer is assigned to the MT to spam fast heals in 
the event the cheal chain is disrupted by a fizzle or lag or 
inattentiveness...

mgb heal - mass group buff heal. basically just area effect heals on 
everyone...typically most useful against mobs with area effect abilities...
