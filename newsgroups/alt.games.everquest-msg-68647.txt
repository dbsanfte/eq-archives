I believe there was. I don't recall exactly when I downloaded the DX8 dll
from the test server, but it was several days (maybe 10??) before Luclin was
released. In fact, there were several patch messages asking for people to
download and try the dll, sending any bug reports to them. I had some early
problems with the DLL - most noatbly the memory leak you mention later, but
either they fixed it or a driver GF3 driver update did since I no longer
have that problem. The DX8 dll is a VAST improvement in the Kunark tree
zones. Even with a very beefy machine, I still lagged noticably in Warslik,
BW, etc. DX8 is silky smooth in those zones.

I stiil think you are being unfair with their in house testing. If they've
been developing this release for 6 months, their testers have been busy for
6 months. I've been developing software for 14 years now, and even with
custom software developed for a few customers (costing millions BTW), in
house testing quickly loses effectiveness.

The cost of trying to produce absolutely bug free code is enough to make
most people sick. Critical, or Man-Safe code testing standards force very
simple (deterministically testable) code that can cost thousands of dollars
per line to produce.

Also, I doubt there are more than a couple hundred people on the test server
at any given time, and very few high level characters (I never play there,
so that's just a guess). I doubt that even the test server is a fair
emulation of the "EQ world".

Aye, many of these features were not included precisely because it made more
sense to bring these things in incrementally. Luclin and the DX8 engine were
"big enough" for one upgrade. They did, in fact, introduce the DX8 engine 10
days or so before Luclin. "Rushing" game software to market (again, we are
not talking about Aircraft control, medical software, or other "critical"
software) is the MOST effective way of getting a quality product to a
majority of customers. Verant could have sat on the release, testing in
house, for another 3 months without significantly reducing the bugs. As it
is, one week after the release, most significant bugs are fixed and others
are rapidly dissappearing. By Christmas, the vast majority of people will be
happily playing away with a greatly improved product. Even those who
suffered with lower end systems will be able to play as well as before as
more optimizations come into effect.

Again, game developers must make money to survive. Their relationship with
their customers is not adversarial. I truly believe this is the most optimal
low cost test paradigm available and therefore the best way to produce high
quality, complex, game software. A game company that drives itself into
oblivion because it cannot decide when software is done is of no use to
anyone.
