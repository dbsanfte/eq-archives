Well, let's put it this way... I learned VB because I was on a job
where the client insisted ("Do you know VB?" "No, but I can by
Monday").

I wish, I really wish, that they had insisted on C++ instead. Then at
least I would have learned a useful language that I hate instead of a
useless one I hate.

And what is the frigging fascination with Java? A couple of years ago
I worked for a place that was making software for a handheld system (a
Telxon machine as I recall) that was running Windows. That was all it
was running. It would never run a different operating system. But they
insisted on writing the application in Java, when they already had a
staff skilled in C. Why? I don't know. They didn't even know, unless
it was to jump on the BS bandwagon. And when the Java app proved to be
a slow piece of crap, they replaced pieces of it here and there with,
yes, you guessed it, sub programs written in C.

Hey, didja notice that we have this thread all to ourselves? Like a
honeymoon suite or something.
