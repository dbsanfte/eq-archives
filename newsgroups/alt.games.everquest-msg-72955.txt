We get SoW at 49, not that its of any real help running across zones to res
people.  Raising their AC does tend to help em live longer so we have to res
em less often.

Since we don't have dual weild, we are best suited to 2hb use.  Get a runewood
and go to town.  I didn't give up melee till 44.  I also soloed half of each
level
from 44 to 52, and it wasn't on undead, thank you kindly, Wyverns and Azure
Drakes... show me an undead only spell that works on those two and I'll buy
you a frosty mug of Brells' Blessed Stout!

Stun Stun Stun.  Yes its ghetto to the extreme, but its better than mez in
its way, as your pet can beat away on the target while you mez and do
DD at the same time.  Fear while you do this so the target doesn't kill
your pet when it gets in a lucky resist.

We get that at 59 I think, self only, but still as an introvert why should you
care?

If I had a wish list here it would be for the freaking Unswerving Hammer
of Faith not to kill itself.  600 mana for a fairly jokelike pet I can handle...

but do you really need to add insult to injury by including that suicide code?
Just for spite I used it to get two of my epic pieces, and cleared half of
SolA on one pet.   Next time I'm in GFay I plan to use UHOF to clear
Crushbone too :)
