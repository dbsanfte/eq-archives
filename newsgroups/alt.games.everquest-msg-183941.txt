Understood.  If exp was really that slow to gain, I wouldn't want to lose
that much either.    But the truth is, it's only that slow to gain because
of where you have been fighting at 61.

In a good group in the goblin caves in Plane of Nightmare, you could make
back that 30 percent in 4 or 5 hours, not three weeks.

In answer to your question about "good hunting spots at 61"...  I'd say they
don't exist in the old world.
