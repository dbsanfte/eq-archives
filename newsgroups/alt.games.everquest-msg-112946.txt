OK, everyone says don't make jewelry. I was considering taking up a
trade that I might profit from.  Maybe tailoring.  ??   How about that
one......in fact I think someone may have already recommended that one
earlier.   Maybe I should first ask, is it really to my benefit to
take up a trade at all ?   Perhaps killling and looting will remain
the best option......
