Brownies were great XP to my mage at 51, was helping a friend with druid
epic and as we were getting the group together druid got attacked I stayed
and fought and took out 2 before i zoned. They spawn at 0, 0. The only
problem with camping them is when the ones for druid epic pop - i just gate,
no way I can take on both the tainted and corrupted. BTW was getting 1/4
blue a kill. Figure would be great for necros too.
