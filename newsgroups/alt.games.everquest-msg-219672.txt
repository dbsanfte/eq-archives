I have monk with 201 bind wounds, binding for 80hp / bandage up to
70%.  I've used bind wounds a lot since then and never got any further
raises though the skill caps say 210 is the max level.

What I can't work out from the newsgroups is whether the amount you
heal goes up above 80hp / bandage at any level?  If not what do you
gain from 210 in bind wounds over 201?

Cheers
