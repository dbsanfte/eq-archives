If you knew what you are talking about, you'd know that the son had 
indeed psychological problems outside of EQ. It's a known fact. The 
responsible person is the mother that were allowing her son to play an 
addicting game when she knows he shouldn't, and also I still wonder how 
he had access to a gun(or something else with what he killed himself) 
when he was mentally weakened and known to have suicidal thought. He had 
everything he needed to commit suicide there, as if no one tried to 
prevent it.

Suicide is the last 'decision' you will take, it's the proof that you 
lack the strength and will to continue with your life which obviously 
doesn't make you happy, it shows that you are at a point where you have 
no other choices than commit a suicide or living a life you hate because 
you can't find a way to make it better anymore. At this point it's not 
really a decision anymore, it's like chosing between : you want to die 
now or you want to die later but you will suffer until it happens. When 
facing this choice, you can't be rational.

Right you said if, but there is no point in saying if either, thinking 
EQ is responsible makes no sense at all.

He's not asking the wrong person, he's asking a question that has no 
answer, I see it more as an argument than a question. It shows the fact 
that thinking EQ being responsible can't be a right thought.

Open your eyes and watch what's happening, lots of decisions taken by 
the court are not really rational and intelligent. They just choose the 
easy way and blame the easy target, when it's not always the good decision.
