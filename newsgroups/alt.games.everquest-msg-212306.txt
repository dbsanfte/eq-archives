Hi all!

A few months ago, I asked for some people to contribute little stories 
for sidebars in a book I was writing about EverQuest titled "The 
EverQuest Companion."  That book is now finished, and should be hitting 
the shelves on August 28th (the final title was "The EverQuest 
Companion: The Inside Lore of a Game World").

However, around the beginning of December, I got a new computer, and I 
only just now got my newsgroups working again (racing deadlines on my 
book took up most of my time).  When I did the switch over, I was able 
to recover my email, but the thread is now lost.

So, I need to get in touch with the following people, as they are all 
entitled to a free copy of the book (and there's a letter I have to send 
them from McGraw-Hill informing them that they've been interviewed).

The people are:

Richard Lawson
Tarre Soulskin
Just Me

If they could please get in touch with me ASAP, I would be very 
grateful.  It's rather important to me that everybody who is entitled to 
one gets their free book.  My email address is delric@istar.ca.

Best regards to all,

Robert B. Marks, author, The EverQuest Companion

"The battle is terrible and now joined by all.
Count Roland is no laggard;
He strikes with his spear, while the shaft still lasts.
With fifteen blows he has broken and destroyed it;
He draws forth Durendal, his fine, naked sword,
And spurs on his horse to strike at Chernubles."
		- The Song of Roland, lines 1320-1325
