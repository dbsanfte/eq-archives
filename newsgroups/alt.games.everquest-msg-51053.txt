Go kill a hg and then go but her the common drop off of broog in seb  . It
is a 25 ac 50 hp shield that drops with amazing regularity. (well might cost
250pp so maybe kill hgs for 30 mins)

There are a couple of 15 ac shields running around in your level range but i
cant remember where they are . the cgs is a good stat shield in sol A .
