A bunch of new low and mid level spells (some shared with Shaman
and/or Ranger).  The indoors castable movement speed buffs are
way cool, except that they're useless to high levels because they
are no faster than Run2 and Run3 respectively.  All these new
lower spells might be a hint that they are gonna start another
new no transfer server tho, why else put so much effort into the
pre-50 game they already compressed to almost nothing on the
established servers?  Also, there's a L65 group wolfform (Feral
Pack) that's new, 144 minutes of +72% movement, +72 ATK, and
ultra vision.
