This really only applies to training skills, though. There are alot of
Shaman spells that are common to other classes. For example, SOW is a
Druid spell also, Serpent Sight is Enchanter, Bind Affinity is almost
every caster class, etc. Some spells probably will be Shaman only,
Spirit of Bear & Cat come to mind. But, if you're looking to upgrade
your spells, you can certainly find enough to get by until you go home.
