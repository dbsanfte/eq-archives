Actually, in my experience, racial hide can't be tested by external
visibility, I've had a parenthesis on my name (invisible, but visible due to
having see invis, from my bracer of the hidden) while racially hidden, but
still con scowling to stuff that hide does work on.

Also, racial hide/sneak in the case of halflings (non-rogues) shouldn't
stack (it didn't on my warrior), it might on rangers though because they get
sneak and hide as a class ability, although they don't get hide until level
25; I was also under the impression that ranger hide/sneak didn't give the
success/fail message that rogues got.  Then again, I think rogues don't get
class hide until level 3 or so.
