Dont know kinda enjoyed it, kinda fun really.

No indeed make lots of cash and buy twice as much stuff and level
twice as fast as these groupies. Raids bite, are long, boring and ya
never win the roll. As for the xp being better some simple math will
tell you that a group has to kill as much as 6 times what you kill
single kiting. You keep all the loot too.

The keep sux plain and simple it is the worst place to go except for
one reason, to understand the benifits of not grouping. For that
matter go where ever you have fun.

Drivel, hogwash, and wrong. Play your game Druid any way you want any
where you want as long as you use cortesy and common sence.  As for EF
being all that populated having played there at various levels I can
go as long as an hour and never see anyone else. But then I dont need
any help with the mobs CAUSE IM A DRUID!

And when hes 50 with 10k in the bank and at least that much on his
back be sure to add your insanity to that too.

Man have fun
