you just need to be conscious of the stacking, especially for the secondary
HP buff (some lucy fanatic will provide the slot =p )...BSS, SoT, and SV all
share a slot

BSS is the big HP one
SV is second best, and gives some +atk (and it's conveniently cast by the
BL, who you'll bug for a SD if you feel you need it)
and SoT is the crappy one, the one rangers get, the +atk buff with a tiny
+hp component

none of these overwrite eachother - they all block eachother...you have to
decide which you want (c'mon, it's BSS)
