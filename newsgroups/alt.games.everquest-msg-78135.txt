On the other hand, my own human Necro is a really swell fellow, it's just 
that he liked to play with dead things as a child, and thinks it's a 
complete hoot to dress in black and have a skeleton follow you around. He 
loves hunting in Oasis so he can make himself useful casting Cure Disease 
on people who got too social with a wandering mummy. He's nice to his 
pet, likes to be liked, loves to be loved, and thinks that people who 
discriminate against others simply for not being alive should develop an 
opend mind and a more tolerant attitude. He's seriously thinking of 
coining the term "pulseist" to describe those vital-signs zealots.
