my ranger just hit 200 foraging at lvl 50.  i'm not the only one i know who
still compulsively forages, even though i usually just drop whatever i've
foraged and really can't gain anything by it.

foraging is a dangerous game to play...  before you know it you're wasting
entire keystrokes every few minutes!
