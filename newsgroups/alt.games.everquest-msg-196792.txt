So, under your system, the bard fires up a few AE songs on a raid, sets 
autofollow on a groupmate, and goes AFK for a few hours while the raid does 
its thing.  Apply to group situations as necesary.

Hey, maybe we can automate their targetting of adds and mez/charm too!

While we're at it, let's automate backstab, evade and pickpocket for 
rogues, automate mez and charm refreshes for enchanters, buff refreshes and 
slows for shaman, and ranged attack for rangers (actually, this last one 
doesn't seem like a bad idea ;) ).

It's sounding like Progress Quest (http://www.progressquest.com) is more 
along your line of taste than EverQuest.

There's a reason bards can do amazing things: it takes a ton of work to do 
it.
