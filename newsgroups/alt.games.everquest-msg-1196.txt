In a sense, yes.  Those names should be refused *by default* by the name
filter because of the majority of those names would be violating the policy.
If someone wants to use a legitimate name starting with "The (or whatever)"
then that should be handled in-game via the GM.
After the fact, I was amazed that I'd gotten the name "Legerdemain" through
the filter.  "Le-" and "La-" are along the same lines at "The-" or "Da-" as
clear violations.  The name does break down as "Leger de main" to mean
slight of hand.  I would not have been surprised to have to petition to get
this approved.  It's a step I'd be more than willing to take to avoid some
many kidZ trying to have names like "DaBoss" "or "LeTerminateur"
