Does higher level root get resisted less?  Also, does it break less?
I've been using thegraspings roots and so far so good, but I wonder if
I could be getting better results with ensnaring roots.  The damage
component isn't an issue for me, but not running out of mana while
some roots are resisted is :)   [along with the slightly slower
casting time]
