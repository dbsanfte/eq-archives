Don't know the command and cannot verify personally, but I heard from 
someone last night that you can actually change your profession choice now. 
This would be thematically consistent with being able to respec your traits 
(/respec, can do once) and being able to re-attune all of your equipment. 
It's like they're giving us a bye on our original choices now with all these 
dramatic changes.

I'm going to stick with Alchemy, but I understand completely your feelings 
about the Sage class. They screwed the pooch on that class unbelievably and 
not a single Sage that I know (and I knew most of them quite well) has 
bothered to advance into the higher tiers and several have left the game or 
re-rolled new characters. I even started buying Apprentice IIs a while ago.
