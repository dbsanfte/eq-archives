OK.  The shield has reasonable dex on it, I'm guessing that's why he
went for it, he's probably dumb enough to bag Swiftwind and equip this
shield as he probably thinks that the effect on SW is haste and
nothing else so the increased dex gives him more archery crits while
in reality he's losing raw ATK and in turn DPS.

That's assuming he even knows what ATK is.  Or DPS.  Or anything.  
Oh and I wouldn't prevent him looting it, I've just want to know WHY.
See my quote above.

I'm pretty much in favour of 100% freewill when it comes to points
systems; for example there's been quite a lot of high end drama over
Rangers (and Beastlords presumably) putting in for healing focus
items, that's crap IMO.
