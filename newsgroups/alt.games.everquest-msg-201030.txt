As long as you have seperate acct keys for each acct you can have any number
of accts with same billing info, you'll have to re-enter all your
information as if you didn't have any other accts though (same goes for if
you cancel your acct for 1 mth the next time you wanted to restart it you'd
have to re-enter your info again).
