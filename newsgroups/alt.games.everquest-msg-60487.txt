}Ok, I killed him with my Troll last night. Not intentionally to answer

}have pointed out, the guards didn't come to his defense.

So... what's a good low damage/low delay 2HB either of my chars could use 
for this purpose?  With gnomish faction hits, I don't think I'd want to 
actually kill him...  Well, my SK might, she's mean that way. :)  I 
thought I'd helped kill him before and gotten no hits.  Perhaps I was 
clever enough to mem blur, and forgot. :)
