Have you had ANYTHING removed from your ability to travel?

You have not been nerfed in any of your abilities.

You've been given a cleric level heal for a start. You also have the
only (?) non-enchanter mana regen buff. You also have the only
combination of track and evac/gate/port which still makes you by far the
best class to have along for exploration.

If the only thing you had to offer your friends was volunteering for
designated driver every weekend, then sitting outside while they
partied, then I'd say it's time to find some new friends...
