Shane Goodall is who that should have been directed at, that is the 
person that made the rather amusing reply talking about how we should not 
use abbreviations while using at least that one in the reply.

I do use abbreviations in EQ, it's a game, I am not about to make 10 
banks of socials to type out commonly used phrases when there are 
perfectly acceptable (to a vast majority of players) abbreviations for 
those phrases.  If you don't like it, tough, don't group with me.  As 
others have said, if you don't understand one of the standard acronyms, 
ask, then you will know.
