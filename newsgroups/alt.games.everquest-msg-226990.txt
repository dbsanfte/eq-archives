I was in a game on the Tunare server, in the middle of combat [of course],
when out of the blue an ad for a family oriented card game, cheapo text on
grey background ad, for jitterbuggames[dot com] spreads across the center of
my screen, covering the center third side to side and probably two-thirds
top to bottom.  The essential part of the screen, obviously.  Wondering if
anyone else experienced it or knows what it might be about.  Wish I would
ahve taken a screen shot, was to concerned with running for safety [blind],
then exiting and hunting down the web site.

Don't think I'll be buying their game - don't you either.
