Pulling, well, in outdoor zones with mobs that you can Harmony of Nature,
there are not many classes that pull better than rangers, especially if the
ranger has inate camo.  They can also chain pull while still putting dps on
the original mob while running off.

The main problem with ranger pulling, is they have no get out of jail free
card if things go south, eating a death or training your group and hoping
they can handle it are your only two options.

I would like an outdoor only escape, similar to a rogues, costing the same
AA, and the same refresh rate.  I find it irratating that my success in
pulling always boils down to whether HoN will be resisted.  Of course, with
this AA, you could still screw up while it is refreshing, but it would help.
I doubt rogues or bards would like that idea much though.  I would happily
gives rogues indoor snare in exchange for it :P

Indoors we can still pull, but obviously have no lull, in ldon's it is easy
really, using root you can usually get singles, snare the add (the one you
have rooted), when the MT is on the mob (unless the ranger is the main
tank).

I would say berserkers are a class near the bottom of the heap when it comes
to pulling, but in most places, all you need is the ability to aggro
something and run back to your group.

Once you get past the 'must get singles' part, you will find pulling more
enjoyable, and singles generally dont keep a party entertained especially if
there is a real CC class there.
