Following up on the long discussion of twisting
in the bard class and how they might change it
in EQ2 - here's a tidbit from an interview on
eq-stratics

"Q. As much as we've heard that Bards were a problem in the coding in 
EQLive, will there still be a Bard class in EQ2? 

A. Yes, the Bard is a class in the Rogue archetype profession tree. We 
intend for the Bard to be markedly different in EQ2. They are a rogue-based 
class, which means they must be able to function in the rogue role within a 
group or raid. This also means the same armor types as rogues and roughly 
the same combat ability (in regards to melee damage, etc). 

Twisting multiple songs will be possible, but it will be a direct part of 
the Bard play mechanic, and thus rely less on the player's stamina and 
tolerance for key pressing and more on resource management and tactics."
