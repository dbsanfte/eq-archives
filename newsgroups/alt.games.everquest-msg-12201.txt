CoM is a nice zone. It's easy to navigate, and there are a few good
melee weapon drops there. And being melee bindable is a big plus. The
biggest problem is there are no merchants anywhere around, so when you
get encumbered, or out of food, you have problems. The outside zone is
very hazardous, without port or at least SoW it can be lethal. It's a
shame they didn't put a Druid ring with merchants here or in
Trakanon's Teeth, the place would be much more popular.
