Holy shit. You are a stronger man than I am. The Sword of Shannara flew 
out of the window after just a hundred pages. Life is just too short.

If you liked The Three Musketeers do yourself a favour and read The 
Phoenix Guards, Five Hundred Years Later, and The Viscount of Adrilankha, 
by Steven Brust. I'm not a Dumas fan, and so I didn't enjoy them as much 
as you probably will, but I really liked his Vlad Taltos series. These 
books are basically The Three Musketeers series (you probably guessed as 
much) but taking place in the Taltos universe, and written in Dumas's 
own style, or an exceptional pastiche.
