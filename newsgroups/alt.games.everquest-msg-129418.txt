NGO == non-governmental organization, or non-governing organization.
There are zillions of them, and they all try to affect policies,
internal to a country or internationally, in zillions of ways.  Amnesty
International's mandate is self-styled, self-declared, and, like many,
consists of a large dose of PR added to its activism.  That's not a
put-down; it just means that citing it as some sort of authority is
pretty meaningless.

But it is like the National Rifle Association, Handgun Control Intl,
GreenPeace, Stormfront White Pride, NAACP, PETA, Doctors without
Borders, ACLU, Global Whale Alliance, KKK (American or Philippine),
etc., in that it really just lives by its claims and actions.  AI thus
has no particular authority to define what does and does not constitute
a "human right," "crime against humanity," etc.  Inasmuch as one agrees
with their definitions, it is convenient to cite them as an authority.
Inasmuch as one does not agree with their definitions, it is convenient
to ignore them as having an internal undisciplined agenda without
oversight.

Two important examples include AI's stand against capital punishment
and for abortion rights.  There are many who, in good conscience,
believe that capital punishment is a necessary and *good* thing both
for moral and political reasons.  There are many who, in good
conscience, believe that capital punishment is a crime against
humanity.  There are many who believe that abortion is the killing of
an innocent human being and a gross violation of human rights, and the
millions of abortions performed constitute a racist, sexist act of 
genocide.  There are many who believe that abortion is the removal 
of tissue and does not involve the killing of a human, and that 
interfering with the "right" of a woman to an abortion is a crime 
against humanity.

Amnesty International has come out against the exacution of convicted
serial rape-murderers/victims-of-society and in favor of the
unrestricted killing of unborn children/fetuses (except for the purpose
of acquiring fetal tissue for medical research-- oddly enough,
according to my reading of Amnesty International documents, a woman
should be able to kill her fetus on any whim except if she intends to
donate the tissue to science).

There are good moral, ethical, religious, and cultural arguments to be
made on *both* sides of these and many other issues.  That AI has taken
one position or another does not, in fact, mean much outside of the
acknowledgement that the governing members of the organization have
reached a consensus.

Amnesty International is free to argue its positions, and does it
well.  It is not, however, a moral authority in itself.
