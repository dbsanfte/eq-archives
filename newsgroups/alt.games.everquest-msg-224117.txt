Well do they? I'd bet at 5$ per move they could move well over 15 times 
as many accounts as they would at $75.

Practically nobody thinks SoE customer service is worth a damn.

Au contraire, I've played several of the alternatives, and enjoyed them 
quite a bit, *and* found their customer service and attitudes towards 
their customers to be exemplary by comparison.

I rotate between them as I burn out on any given one. Unfortunately, 
although I enjoy the others, none of them quite replace eq so I still 
keep it in rotation. Hence my earlier comments... I'd drop EQ like a hot 
potatoe if a solid eq alternative came along.
