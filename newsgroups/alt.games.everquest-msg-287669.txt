   You can see some Silver-color items in the Wrath of Lich King which
can be used by 1lv characters! (Which named hairloom items). Such as
「Discerning Eye of the Beast」and 「Venerable Dal'Rend's Sacred
Charge 」.These items are account-bound. You can buy these cool items
through the badges dropped from Naxx (the 10-men raid). These items
can be mailed to any character in the same account.. But they cant be
traded or mailing to any other account.they’re account-bound.
    Well, of course it doesn't means that a 29lv character can get
1000 spell damage. Their abilities will keep growing with the level of
their owners.
    For example: 「Venerable Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge 」is 10 dps, 1
sta, 1crict rating while in a 10lv character. But if it’s in a 60lv
character, it will has 53 dps,10 sta, and 13 crit rating.
   It means that you can use the same items from 1lv-80lv? Not that
sure but who knows, the beta has came out. Check www.thecheapwowgold
