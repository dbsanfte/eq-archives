There are upatched vulnerabilities in IE that can allow an attacker to
install and run code, simply by visiting a website.
Honestly, I wouldnt go to any link posted to me by email.
If I absolutely HAD to look at the link, then consider running a safer
browser like Firefox, or setting my internet security to high.
