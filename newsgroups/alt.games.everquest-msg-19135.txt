To answer your question, no they do not consider that a hostile act.
I've never bound one of the guards, although it'd be interesting to see
what happened, but binding others is fine. Also, casting lev. on the
guards doesn't aggro them either. I think any of those non-aggressive
spells are okay. (Lev didn't lift the guard up, by the way)
