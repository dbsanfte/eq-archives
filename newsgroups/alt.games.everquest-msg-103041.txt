Yes, plus to me this is really more like real life. In real life, you
don't go out of your way to pick some guy up walking down the street
that you don't know. You probably don't even talk to strangers. If a
stranger comes up to me on the street asking for something I loudly
say "NO", while some people just ignore them and look at their own
shoes.

Everquest, to me, is like a world unto itself so you should be just as
wary of and rude to people as you are in real life. It makes not only
good sense in this time of scammers and stalkers, but its actually
better roleplaying. 

So, ignore (without actually /ignore them) a person in everquest today
or refuse to help them. That is more like
real life so it makes you a good roleplayer. Its a bit like Obi-Wan
Kenobi's line in Star Wars episode IV, A New Hope, "You will never
find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy" on their way into the
Mos Eisly cantina. That is Everquest.
