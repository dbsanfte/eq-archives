All I can remember about his specs is it's an off-the-shelf P3-350 he bought
on the highstreet to p##s me off a month after I'd built my own Celeron 333
to save money (he has a job and money to burn... now he's got a mortgage and
NO money)

Basic moral of the story... build your OWN PC (it's not THAT hard if Dixons
can manage it)... you'll save money AND know what's in your box ;o)
I'll get to him at the weekend, open his case... gloat a little... tut-tut
at his system... maybe say something along the lines of "I'm not sure they
even still make these anymore"... and generally rub his nose in it ;o)
