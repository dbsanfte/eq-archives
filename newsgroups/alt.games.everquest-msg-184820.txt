Actually, there are a few notable examples to this. Run 1 (or more for
monks and SKs) and Shrould of Stealth for rogues come to mind.

My suggestion, however, is not to hit 61 until you're committed to
seeing it through to 65. At 60, you still have a ton of non-planar
content to use for XP. At 61, you're not really ready for higher-tier
planes, but all those XP sweet spots in the old world are now awful,
even if they haven't greened out. At 61, you're pretty much stuck with
doing PoI, PoN, and PoD.
