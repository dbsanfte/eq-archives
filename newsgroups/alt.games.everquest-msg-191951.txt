I'm a total noobie in the game, but been around TCP/IP networking for a long
time. Maybe I can help...

Sorry for the top post, but I need some more information, from what you've
mentioned, you have 3 pc's connected to a hub. Is it a hub?? or a switch?? a
hub has no brain, so if your using DHCP (gets IP address automagically at
startup) it won't work unless one of the PC's has a DHCP server running. A
switch/router/firewall box (i.e. Linksys/Siemens etc..) usually has the DHCP
server built in and will configure the pc's on the network as they start. It
also has a DHCP client on the WAN side to get an IP address for the gateway.

If on the other hand the DSL modem is a PCI card in one of the pcs, it will
need to run connection sharing (NAT - Network Address Translation) It think
W2K and XP both have this built in, but it needs to be activated. Win98/Me
etc.. don't but you could use Winroute (www.winroute.com) or others for
this.

Also, DSL will usually give you 1 dynamic IP address (different regions have
different rules here).  So one machine will have two network devices (1
cable modem/1 Ethernet Card) and will translate the addresses from the local
(192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x) to the internet IP address.

You said that the WinMe box hangs on boot when connected to the Network?? is
DHCP turned on?? if so it will hang waiting for a DHCP response from the
server.

If one of the PC's is acting as a gateway, the others will need static IP's
and DNS servers in order to work normally, you can do a winipcfg in
Win95/98/98se/Me and it will show you the IP address' and DNS IP addesses,
if these are blank then the networking isn't being configured correctly and
you could try putting in a static IP (use 192.168.1.1 or
192.168.1.2 and so on or the other range is 10.x.x.x) and get the DNS
addresses from the system that is working on the network (XP and 2K use
'ipconfig' at the dos prompt). If it's still not working, I'd be looking at
the hub with a critical eye check for link lights at the NIC and the Hub
end. or bugger the whole thing and buy a cheap wireless 11mb
gateway/router/firewall.

If you're still having problems - email me...above address is real.
