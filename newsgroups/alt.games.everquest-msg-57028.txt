The God of Hate EXPECTS his followers to stab him in the back some day.
It's the nature of Evil. Evil feeds on itself. It is within character
for a necro of taking his down his god and replacing it with himself.

Tunare is the Mother of All. She is Love and Whoopi Granola Mellowness-
not death onna stick. One does not greet a goddess who loves you by
injuring those she loves. No, like a provoked mother protecting her
young, she'll have your ass for lunch and will never love you again.

How's that for clear?
