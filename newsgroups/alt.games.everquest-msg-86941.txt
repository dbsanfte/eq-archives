You could always switch the syntax, by putting the /group say before the
/assist.

I always update my assist key to automatically target the MA. As such:

/assist Meatshield

As long as you put in their name, and they are in your group, it will target
their target. The way that you could go about it would be to make your's
look like this.

/assist Meatshield
/g Assisting Meatshield beat the snot out of %t!

You might give it a try.
