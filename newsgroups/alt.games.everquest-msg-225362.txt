 >Thats not two healers, thats no healers.

I messed that up. Removing parentheticals and using
English that someone other than myself can understand
(and, BTW, that's a slam on ME, not a slam on you)
It should have read

We had two healers in our group. Myself and a 65 paladin
were the only other two people in the group of four.
