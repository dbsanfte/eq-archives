In my efforts to research this, I've come upon a bunch of discussion
threads and strategies that talk about "pre-nerf" and "post-nerf" damage
for pets, and the weapon vs. no weapon question. Is there a site out
there that has the straight story on this?
  What I'm really looking for is the following: How much damage does my
necro pet do (for whichever level.. currently level 4) and what's his
"bare fist" delay? How much change, if any, will result from a weapon,
and what amt. of damage weapon will he need to do more than he does with
bare hands? Is it even worth giving him that rusty bastard sword or worn
great staff?
