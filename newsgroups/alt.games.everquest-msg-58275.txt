First and foremost, if you haven't been here already,
http://necro.eqclasses.com/
go there at once and bookmark it. There are sections that will answer
necro questions across a broad range of subjects. Sign up for the
discussion forum also. There are a bunch of very experienced necros
there who helpfully answer lots of specific necro questions. You'll also
find strategy guides by level, spell guides, pet information, all manner
of things. Great site.

They've got a good list of all the spells on this page:
http://necro.eqclasses.com/spells.asp
And there's a pair of files you can view or download with the locations
where each buyable spell can be found in each Necro starting area. In
this case, Mika Fugas in the tunnels sells that one. That's where I
bough mine. Remember, there are vendors in two different areas that sell
necro spells. There are two in the small room with the hole in the wall
just as you come downstairs from the abandoned building in N. FP.  Then,
going through the hole in the wall you'll find a tunnel leading to more
guild trainers and vendors. Lots of your spells (though not all) will be
available between these various vendors. Some I had to get out of Neriak
or other caster guilds.

I never found a real use for sense the dead except for getting your
Divination skill up later on. At least not in the first sixteen levels.
I never used syphon strength either. Seemed like a mana hog when
soloing, but YMMV.

Assuming you have the mana, the bone chips, and nothing beating on you,
you can summon again immediately.
Good luck.
