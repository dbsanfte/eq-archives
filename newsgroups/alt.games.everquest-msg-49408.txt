Note: It's been a while since I played my monk, but I remember doing the
quest. The first (and easiest) one spawns at the undead encampment which
you run into if you cross the bridge in from NK and keep heading
straight south a short ways. He stands under some type of structure
there, and I think he had a pet. He's not a roamer, so if he's not up,
just wait around.
  The other two can be a nightmare. One of them spawns out near the bird
town down south and immediately sets out jogging east towards the
hermit's house. I found that if you sit on the north side of the hill
just west of the Hermit, and wait there, you'll see him (or more likely
his placeholder) go by. You may have to kill a LOT of placeholders
before you get the named high shaman. PH is another gnoll shaman.

The last one is the real PITA to find. He spawns someplace up in the NW
corner of the zone, seems to run generally south near the wall for a
while, then turns and heads towards the spires. If you see his place
holder once, kill it and don't leave that spot. He's easy to miss.
