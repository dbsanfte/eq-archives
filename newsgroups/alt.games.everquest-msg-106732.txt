Don't get me wrong I could now, I was refering to level 56/58 (with psc, so
no regen) if the mob ran I was in big trouble.. if I got an add I'd be
screwed too..  A lot I couldn't even finish a fight without FDing.

At the same time, a same level ranger solo'd much much better, if for
nothing else, the root and snare.

Since we started NToV, CoV faction is pretty worthless.. so they have become
my regular exp/pharm spot over the last week or 2.. 3 pairs of oiled greaves
so far :), and an aa level per night.

It's nice because if I get a critical mend, I don't even have any downtime
at all between mobs.

If you get a group up there, try the big cubes too.. a lot of people said we
needed a 'real' group or two, but we had no problems.

The level 56 and level 60 I tanked fine (rampages, hits fast for 240 or so)
with 1 cleric (me) chealing.. group makeup was something like
60monk,60cleric,60mage (mobs are massively MR), 52monk... the 56 one was
actually tougher then the even con

For the red con one we decided to be safe and get a warrior there too, its
kinda funny to see a giant cube Flurry heh.... anyway he dropped without
problems, and I think with an extra healer (to heal during those flurries) I
could tank it too
