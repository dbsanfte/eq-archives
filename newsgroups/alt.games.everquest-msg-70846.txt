First off, I want to apologize for the "cheap bastard" comment from
yesterday. I guess I *was* in a shitty mood, and this is something of a
hotbutton topic for me, but that was uncalled for.

But to your point, no. I totally disagree. You can't separate "loot" and
"gems" and "cash". It's *all* loot. And if the cleric winds up in a
group where they exactly enough trash gems to pay for their dots and
pearls, and nothing else, and the melee types, etc. walk off with a
bunch of top end gear that they couldn't even roll on because of NB4G
rolling, then I think they won't be clericing for your group again any
time soon. 

As to cleric stuff dropping as often or more often than other classes,
I'll grant you that *can* be true in a few spots. Chardok, Hate, couple
others. But in most zones, we've been finding that melee type high-end
drops are a lot more common. Many of them very specific. (i.e. "monk
only" or "warrior, pally, SK, bard only", etc.) Generally, (and Seb is a
very good example) if the cleric gets to roll on anything it will either
be a "any plate class" thing that they may or may not be able/interested
to use, or an all/all. Very little "make the clerics drool" stuff falls.

Without going back into a different post, I'll also answer your "Mr.
1KPP isn't shit rich boy" question;  No. I'm not even close. After
buying Rebreathers last night, I think I might have seven KPP left in
the bank. But money comes and it goes. Seriously, a thousand plat that I
might miss out on is simply *not* that big a deal. If I need a thousand
plat fast that badly, there's several places I can run to and earn it
pretty quick. Hell, I could get off my lazy ass (or onto it, as the case
may be) and finally go clean out my bank and go auction a bunch of shit
I need to unload that I won on rolls but don't want. No, a thousand PP
is a nice chunk of change, but it's not "end of the world" money, and if
our group's cleric walks off at the end of the night with 1000 PP in
gems and I dont' get didley except a bunch of xp, I'll still be happy
for them and wish them well, knowing they'll be back to CHeal me again
next time I've got three frogs beating on me because the chanter's mez
broke.
