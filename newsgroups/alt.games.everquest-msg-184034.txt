Sadly, some do.  I can certainly percieve that one might quit because the
game had become too time consuming.  Most of what he says is actually true,
in some ways.  If he said he was quitting for all the reasons he did without
beginning by insulting everyone who actually still gets enjoyment from the
game, I would not have found his post unreasonable.  But, he had to lead off
with childish garbage that taints the whole argument.

Cheers,
Eric
