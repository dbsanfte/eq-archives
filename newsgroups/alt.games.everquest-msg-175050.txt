I don't use a 'timer' myself and haven't suffered at all.  Most of the time
in the higher end game, shaman buffs tend to last a long time so you group
members aren't telling 'all the time' to recast a buff, only every hour or
so when the buff finally wears off.  You will get a feel for the duration of
the buffs naturally and kinda know when to rebuff.  The only one I really
time would be Haste(because it doesn't last very long) and this one is easy
to watch just by casting it on you or your pet before you do the tanks and
when it wears off you'll know when to re-do it.
