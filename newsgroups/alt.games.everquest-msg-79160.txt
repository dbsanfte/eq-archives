You are completely wrong.  If I pay you $100 a week, or $200 every two 
weeks do you get the same amount of money in 52 weeks?  (Hint, the answer 
is yes.)  If you have a 50/50 chance of winning $100 every week or of 
winning $200 ever two weeks, will you make the same amount of money either 
way.  (Hint, the answer is yes.)

He wasn't asking to get his duel-weild skill up, he was asking to get the 
most damage.  The ONLY THING THAT AFFECTS OFFHAND DAMAGE IS RATIO.  Speed 
has nothing to do with it.

I didn't say jack shit about getting duel-weild skill up.  Either you're 
missing the point, or hopelessly clueless.  In my case, with duel-weild 
maxxed, a 30/60 weapon produces EXACTLY the same amount of damage as a 
5/10 weapon.
Also, your statement that the more rolls you get the better is ONLY for 
skill-ups.  If you've maxxed your duel-wield skill for the level, a 1/2 
weapon is EXACTLY the same damage as a 75/150.  So yes, if you have maxxed 
your duel-wield skill for your level, a 30/60 is exactly the same as a 
5/10.

No, magic number has nothing to do with this.  At least when I refer 
to magic number it's 2(damage)+1, and I don't think anyone would say want 
a 20/50 main-hand compared to a 5/10 main-hand, even though 41 > 11.
