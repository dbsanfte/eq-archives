The only problem I have with "unengaged" monsters being ok to pull, is times
where i need to cast a buff or 2 immediately before combat. Damage shield is
a good example of this. Under verants and your definition (Youve said you
dont do this so its cool), someone could just pull my mob im about to pull
while im putting up DS. So what I have to do is time it so DS is already up
and "beat" them to getting the first cast on the mob? Got to say that sucks.

This reminds me of a long time ago when I was hunting outside paw with my
druid. Heres a case where you have to pull imeediately it spawns or someone
will take it. No time to cast damage shield. So what do I have to do?....
Pull the mob... run it away from the others (so I wont get it KS's as a
"wandering mob") snare it, DS myself and kill it... well away from paw.

If I were a total asshole (im only a partial one), I could go and take the
AC camp in oot, by having a real fast casting spell and getting in first
cast on him... then petitioning that they ars KS'ing. They might have been
there first, but so long as its whoever engages first, then they are
technically KS'ing.

Not a good rule imo. Someone who has been sitting there and waiting for a
spawn *should* be able to pull it, without someone coming along and "racing"
them to the first ago.
