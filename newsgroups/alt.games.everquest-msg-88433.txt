    The Guardians hit you took was actually a plus. Killing bixies only
makes bixies hate you.

    No, you just got close enough to a KOS mob (see below) to be added to
the hate list. Any time you make a mob's hate list, if it dies you take the
faction hit.

    Bixie Drones are KOS to everyone I've had go near one (even folks who
are indifferent to bixies in general), and give the mentioned faction when
they die. I bet it was a Drone, and not a regular bixie.
