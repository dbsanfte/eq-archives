    You're behind the times. They already nerfed the summoned hammer badly
enough that it's now useless for what it was intended to do. Guess two weeks
of being on Test, and the developers being satisfied about the damage output
it created, can be reversed if enough people whine about it. And the
original problem - clerics being unwanted in XP groups because everyone
gobbles up weak mobs that don't require clerics to be killed - remains.
Especially since they greatly ramped up the difficulty on many high level
mobs with the resist changes at the same time as they upped the reward on
them.
