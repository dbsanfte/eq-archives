Depends, where, how, with who and what you are fighting, as my post as I
pointed out, my suggestions were for soloing in outdoor zones, never got
hit, didn't need ac, still don't at 44. I am following the same route as a
friend who is now lvl 53, and he aint had a problem. I know we would have
probs in some circumstances.... so avoid em.....lol.
Besides, if ya in a group and getting hit...it's time to have a chat with
your tank....
