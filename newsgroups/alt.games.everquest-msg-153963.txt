If it wasn't clear earlier... even if bonuses don't apply I don't
see the downgrade as that big a deal.

I noticed myself that it's not tanks with >7500HP that would
be affected, but tanks with maybe >8500HP, since cutting
things that fine solely to conserve mana strikes me as
irresponsible. (I'm a highly aggressive healer by habit, timing
heals so each heal takes the tank to exactly 100% as nearly
as I can judge. Obviously my habits will need to change with
CHeal..)

My objection isn't really that Druids & Shammys can heal. Healing
is good. The more people who can heal well, the better.

My objection is that clerics just aren't all that *interesting* to play,
because the range of spells available (heals, rezzes, roots, nukes,
HP/AC buffs) is much more specialised than the other priestly
classes. Yes, clerics are now better at toe-to-toe combat, but in
a group situation a cleric should generally be medding, not
duking it out. Besides - if I want to tank, I *have* an alt tank. :-)

I think it's a good idea that clerics can absorb damage - gives
time to root & scoot. Being able to incur substantial melee
damage just seems bizarre.

Anyway, you may want to view my objections to Druids &
Shamans getting better heals as an attempt to turn the changes
into a bargaining chip with Verant. :-) Not that they're listening.

Is there somewhere which describes the improvements to
clerics in the high levels? The only thing I can recall mentioned
in the Verant patch notes was the introduction of Bash.

Um... the cleric pet is actually *useful* now? Must have
missed that. From what others had said it sounded like
it was way up there with Imbue Peridot in the usefulness
stakes.

I haven't hit those levels yet. I can see how it would hurt.

I do find it strange that so many people assumed that clerics
would be complaining. The nearest thing I've seen to a
complaint here is my own rather mild whining - which is
mainly about how interesting the class is to play, not about
the change to CHeal.
