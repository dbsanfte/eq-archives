    There's a DC-able mob in every "A" PoP zone, from what I've seen, other
than Time. By "A", I mean (as examples) you can find DC pets in Earth A and
Nightmare A, but not in Earth B or Nightmare B. You can debate whether they
do much damage, but they're there. My favourite: the DC-able mephits in Sol
Ro Tower. They yell "Eeeek!" when they attack, and have these big, adorable
smiles. ;-)
