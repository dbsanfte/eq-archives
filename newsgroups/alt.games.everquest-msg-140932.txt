Oh, I can understand it.  In fact, thinking it over, I wouldn't sell
my Argent Protector for 20k despite its alleged value of 12k, nor
would I pay 20k for it if I didn't have it because of its alleged
value of 12k (actually I bought it for 7k).  But, the fact that the
sentiment is understandable is not the same as it making "sense"
(i.e. being logical).  My understanding of it is keyed to sharing
an equivalently illogical sentiment.  Successful merchant types
seem to be immune to, or able to overcome, this sort of sentiment.

Think about it this way for a moment:
DK is offerred his choice of either 30k or a pre-nerf CoS, which does
he choose?
DK's stated position, which I understand because I empathize with it
despite its illogic, gives us no guidance as to which he would choose.
His position does, however, tell us that whichever he does choose will
become more valuable to him than the other once it is in his possession
(i.e. he would not exchange one for the other, no matter which came
into his possession).

Kaev <-- who suspects that 30k would overcome his sentiment
