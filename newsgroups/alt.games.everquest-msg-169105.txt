I think im a fine cleric for my "solo" endevours..  Im a good cleric for
raids/rotations (I don't lag, I concentrate, and im aware).. both of these
as either duel or tri-botting monk/sham/wiz/cleric..

Grouping though, well I tended to avoid grouping with chanters and the like
because I figure they die enough as is, they don't need me and my cleric
botting adding to their daily death tally..

At least, that was true all through SoL and SoV (sure i'd duo/group with a
chanter friend if I was botting.. but because he is a close friend, I
wouldn't use a pickup or general guild chanter)

Since PoP though, I've been monk and (shaman and/or cleric) on many
occasions, fighting mobs hitting 10x what the velious mobs hit for, with a
chanter/bard in group, casters.. ie a "normal" balanced group.. and I've
never had a problem.. keeping them alive, keeping agro off the cleric etc..

I don't concentrate on my cleric like some of you guys do, granted.. but I
didn't notice heal agro problems in PoV, HoH, and CoD.. at least not in exp
groups, period.
