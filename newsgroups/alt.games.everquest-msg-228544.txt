Everyone will camp for the items that let them be the best X.  It'd be
like Quake in most respects -- get the best gear you can because the
only difference is colors.  Who is going to arm themselves with only
the bowie knife when they can camp for the frequency-agile sniping
laser and the etherial crossbow too? Who is going to be able to heal
themselves only with bandages if they can camp for the cyber-surgeon
kit? Why walk if you can camp for the 7-league boots, the nimbus
speeder, and the enterprise transporter? Just carry it all in your
santa bag of endless contents to avoid the weight penalty.

Using level requirements or skill requirements to wear the gear and
only allowing so much advancement in skill? That's just using a class
system but defining those classes as sword-swinger or spell-caster or
martial artist or healer instead of warrior, wizard, monk and cleric.
Clothes may make the man, but in a game I prefer the man fit the
armor.
