Wait till you see inside. For a very long time my favourite building in
the whole of EQ was the SK guild in neriak - more even than luclin,
velious and kunark buildings.

But VT. VT is *pretty*, very very nicely designed. My guildmates scream
about how tedious it is but... shrug, it seems ok to me. Stuff takes
a while to kill and has an annoying habit of coming back to life with
a new name and body, but... hey, at least its not griegs end ;)

Grats on your key.. I've still not destroyed mine.
