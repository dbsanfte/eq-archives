I'm sure this has been asked before in this NG, but I am still a bit
confused:

We have 4 computers connected together via a router to a cable modem.  My
son (he's almost 13) is bugging the living crap out of me to play EQ, but
I'm not sure how to go about it.

Do I have to buy all the copies of software (like the EQ trilogy, Shadows of
Luclin, and Planes of Power), or can he use mine?  I figured I would buy him
a game card in order to keep him away from any credit card information
(which is how I am paying for my account) and the off chance that the game
might be too far over his head and he'll lose interest.

Am I (or he) about to shell out a lot of money for the software, or just a
little bit for the game card?

Thanks in advance...

 - Jon
