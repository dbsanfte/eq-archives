I disagree here. Though SRTs can fearkite again I think a few of them
might be a bit pissed about this change. After all fear is a nice aggro
tool - if it is resisted! I remember a mob running away and a very
startled SRT chasing it. It turned out the fear did go through and could
not be used for aggro building!

That aside I don't see a reason for removing the fear cap. There is alot
that will change because of that. Pets won't be fearimmune due to level,
summoning mobs might be killed by a single fear class as a feared mob
won't summon etc. This change is the only one I really dislike as it is
unnecessary.
