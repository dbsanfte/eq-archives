All I remember of EJ is bad exp, bad loot, bad gfx lag (damn trees) and
persistent hooting. Yuk ;P
At 45-50 I'd recommend LGuk liveside, SolB, Karnors, Seb entrance/zoneout
temple area, Howling stones entrance and West Wing and as a last resort you
could slum it outdoors in Skyfire or BW or somesuch.
