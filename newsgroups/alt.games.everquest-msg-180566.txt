1) sk - MT - debuff - snare - fear - FD - limited crowd control with fear
(actually quite useful at lower levels i found)
2) shammy - slow - haste - debuff - crowd control with root - heals
3,4,5) with those two you can pretty much rolls dice on the last 3. 3
wizards would be great... weak until lvl 30ish but after that you'd have
some very short fights...
