It's both normal and a bug.  :)  It used to be that you could only get 
instrument skill-ups if you were playing an instrument song and actually 
using the correct instrument.  So to get a percussion upgrade, you had to 
be singing a percussion song (i.e. Selos) and be holding a percussion 
instrument.  If you were singing a percussion song and NOT holding an 
instrument, you could only get singing skill-ups.  
Sometime shortly before the SoL expansion a patch introduced a bug where 
you could get instrument skill-ups if you were singing an instrument song, 
even if not holding the drum/lute/flute/etc.  Nobody really complained, 
because now you can finally get those hard to raise skills up, but it made 
it difficult to raise singing.  The way to raise singing now is to sing 
songs that use the voice skill.  The earliest one is your level 4 Lyssa's 
Locating Lyric, or you can use the level 7 or level 10 songs.  There are a 
number of other songs, but these are the ones that you will definately 
have in your book at almost any time after your first 2-3 hours played.
