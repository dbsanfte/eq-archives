Yeah I know, but the whole thing really bummed me out. I've hot keyed
/loc and will try and get into the habit of just hittihg it every so
often, should help. Stumbled into the Bandit camp tonight, only one
bandit. So I'm fighting and doing ok. When I look next I've got 2 more
hitting on me, well went down of course, but this time had a loc from
not far away. Snuck in and dragged my corpse and ran very fast away.
I'll learn, just a painful lesson. It's fun getting your corpse back,
when it works. When it doesn't well try again. It's the not knowing
where the hell you died that's the bitch.
