By "carrots" do you mean "loot", "coins" and "equipment"?  For some 
people, those are valuable carrots.  For others (admitedly, a smaller 
group), they are meaningless trinkets, and the REAL carrot is being able 
to walk the long way around.  Loot, coins & equipment are "necessary 
evils", encumbrances that just slow you down on your journey.

The point being that there is more than one way to play a game.  An 
important choice is whether you're going to try to maximize your loot/XP 
pick-up, or your "real life experience", as you "go the long way 
around", as you say.

For some, "working harder" *IS* the reward.  What you call "wasting your 
time", I call "carrot" -- what you call "carrot", I call "wasting your 
time."  This is why games such as EQ and WoW are so popular: because 
they have something for everybody, and don't ONLY appeal to the majority.
