Go to your nearest newbie zone and start announcing that in one hour
you'll come back and buy all the snake eggs they can gather for some
rediculous price. (ten plat a stack or something.) You'll quickly have
lots of energetic newbies out gathering them for you. Failing that, run
around the newbie zones and kill a bunch yourself, but it's long boring
work. :-(
