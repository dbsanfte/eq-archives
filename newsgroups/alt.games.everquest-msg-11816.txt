Who said SK's pets are nothing more than a DOT?  Not me (anymore).  My
little guy Jonn, whom I will always remember, saved me and my shammies
bacon.

Our druid was AFK so me and my other groupmate (A shammy) decided to fight a
blue con giant.  Well, as I pulled him, another spawned yellow and joined in
the fight.  Jonn jumped on the blue as I was fighting him.  I switched to
the yellow and let Jonn take on the blue.  The shammy went oom kinda early
(I know, we should have been more careful with his mana pool, but we got too
cocky).  Anyway, my pet can take maybe 4 hits and then he is a pile of
bones, but Jonn found it deep in his heart to keep fighting when the chips
were down.  He tanked that blue giant until me and the shammy had the yellow
to half life.  The blue finally joined in and we managed to dispatch the
yellow and jump on the blue.  We survived with me down to 1 bub and no mana
for either of us.

Well, I wish the little guy would have made it, but he had no chance.  At
least he gave his life for the good of the group.

BTW: If you are ever in the NE corner of the giant fort In WW, look down for
a pile of bones and give a little smile to good ole Jonn.
