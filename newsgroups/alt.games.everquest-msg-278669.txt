As of level 33, a Mystic has a group heal/cure that will cure 
disease/poison as I recall, and also has a AoE debuff that will reduce 
the resistances of all mobs in an encounter.  Off hand, I don't know what 
a cleric or druid has at that level.

Well, I never did buy into the need for the "holy trinity" anyway.  There 
are many combinations of classes that will work just fine for xp 
purposes, even in situations where you are not just getting single pulls.  
First off, enchanters are not the only class that can mez,  secondly, 
warriors are not the only class that can tank, and finally, clerics are 
not the only class that can heal.  There are also other methods of doing 
crowd control that do not involve mezzing.  Mobs can be off tanked, they 
can be rooted off, they can be pulled by and FD class that can reliably 
get singles.
