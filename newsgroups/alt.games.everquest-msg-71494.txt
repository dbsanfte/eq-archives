Great story!

One of the more amazing experiences I have had was also in BB while I was a
wee lad of 7.   I was teamed with a level 8 warrior and we decided to try
our luck at a goblin camp.   We killed one and were fighting another but the
fight was going bad.  I was almost dead when the goblin wacked me and
dropped me.  I fell to the ground and started "bleeding to death".  I never
had that happen before and it took me awhile to realize what was happening.
The goblin didn't finish me off but turned to the near dead warrior.  A few
seconds later, The warrior dropped and started "bleeding to death" too.  At
the same instant, I healed enough to "pop back up" and wacked the goblin.
This one hit caused him to start walking away and I followed, barely able to
move, attacking him.  The warrior soon healed enough to "pop up" and joined
me in finishing the goblin off.  It was my first character but not the
warriors, and he told me how lucky we were.   I smile as I look back on
those "innocent" days of a true EQ newbie.
