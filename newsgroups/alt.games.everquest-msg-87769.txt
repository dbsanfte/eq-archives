No, never, ever tell someone you are reporting and petitioning.  Just do it.
Then, assuming one is online, a guide or gm can come in,  and watch what is
going on, and take appropriate action based on what he sees.  The offender
will never know until he is contacted by the guide or gm, as they can be
there without being seen or showing up in /who lists.
