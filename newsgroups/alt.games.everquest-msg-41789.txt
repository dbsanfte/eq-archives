There were people in their mid-40s last week.

No, this is coming from people who are well on their way to level 50.
They didn't need to go to the frontier zones to get to that level, and
they hadn't engaged in PvP unwillingly.

Well, I'm pretty positive that I read somewhere that Relics are only
going to affect you if you are in the frontier area, not in your
realm. It might have been in the official FAQ. If not, then it might
have been a posting by Mythic on a beta board.
