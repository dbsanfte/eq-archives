Amen. I agree with you 100% Dan. Yes, charm soloing for enchanters is
beautiful, WHEN IT WORKS. It only takes one bad thing to happen to get
you killed, and then you just lost the experience you've spent the last
few hours acquiring. The thing I don't like about Cyrakis' plan is that
he is reliant on 'getting a SOW from someone'. That's fine, it's pretty
easy to get a SOW now and then. But if you're going to be charm-soloing,
that's a lot of hours. A lot of hours == a lot of SOWs. What's the point
of soloing if you are reliant on someone else's buffs? Just group, for
crying out loud (it IS a multiplayer game, you know), and watch the exp
fly, with a MUCH REDUCED chance of dying. Because the #1 rule in EQ is,
something bad and beyond your control WILL happen when you're least
expecting it. And an enchanter is a pretty weak punching bag in a tight
spot (yes, stun and mezz are wonderful, but you have to a) be alive to
cast them, b) not be being pounded into mush to cast them, and c) have
mana left over to cast them). Expecting charm to stick for any
reasonable length of time on an even con mob without Tash'ing it first
is not my idea of fun in a game where death could mean a couple of hours
work lost. But hey, some people like living on the edge. If you do, then
go for it.

My opinion: Charm is neat sometimes. Yes I've used it, I've charm solo'd
spectres etc. Soloing is neat sometimes; sometimes you just want to do
something by yourself, sometimes you can't find anyone who will group
with you (especially in the old, pre-Breeze days: getting a group as an
under-29 level enchanter was HARD). But the bottom line is enchanters
are one of the best and most group-friendly classes around (tied with
bards and clerics I suppose, though of course I'm biased into thinking
their the best :) ). Enchanter's shine in groups; 12-16 were the stages
when I was learning how to not only play an enchanter effectively in a
group, but also teaching OTHERS how to group WITH an enchanter. You miss
out on that by soloing. Just my 2cp.
