    I have to go with Sang here. Being out of the game for 20 seconds just
by trying to open a backpack in my inventory and put something in it off a
corpse is more than just "optimization". The game rapidly becomes unplayable
at that point. For someone like Sang, whose guild fights large-scale
battles, it must be abyssmal.

    Again, you aren't playing at the scale Sang is. I've noticed myself that
the two large guilds on my server aren't raiding anywhere near as much as
they normally do, despite having the numbers online. (They're mostly killing
Velious kings and the relatively gimp WToV mobs, despite being able to clear
NToV in a day.) I'm forced to conclude it's because they're having enough
problems with enough people that doing the stuff they normally do isn't
possible - THEIR game, what they did any other night before SoL, is
"unplayable".
