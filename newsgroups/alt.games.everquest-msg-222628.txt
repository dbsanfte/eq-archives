Actually, more different than that. :)

1. FG version is plate look 2. FG version is wearable by a) all races that
can be beastlords and b) all classes that vah shir can be.  So, for
example, no monks, no human/elven anything, no iksar shadowknights, etc.  
This is basically because fungi tunic is unwearable by vah shir and
beastlords, so they created this second version to cover those who were
previously "un-fungi-able".

<---- is still pissed off that froglok shaman can wear fungi tunic, but
not vah shir shaman...just like vah shir have no cultural, but frogs can
use human cultural...Vision changed much between expansions? Bah.
