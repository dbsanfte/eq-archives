Well, back in the old days....

When my shaman first ventured into Blackburrow, carrying his trusty lamp, 
it was very hit or miss to make it all the way down the tunnel to zone into 
Blackburrow, because, even with the lamp, he couldn't see squat.  To make 
matter more interesting, just zoning from Halas to Everfrost, and back, was 
difficult due to how dark that tunnel is as well.
