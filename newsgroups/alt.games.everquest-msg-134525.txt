I would say it doesn't.  If you post with full knowledge and intent
regarding the beating I would say that would perhaps make a case for you
being a masochist but I don't think it speaks to the nature of your
idiocy.  Now if you were to say that reading things backwards (reply
first, original last) makes more sense, then I'd be more inclined to
categorize you as an idiot.

Now can you perhaps answer a question for me?  Why bother to leave all
the text that according to you is unnecessary below your addition to the
thread.  If it provides no contextual basis for your post then snip it,
though you might find folks wondering who you are talking to and what
the subject is in that case, though that would sort of give lie to your
belief that context is meaningless.  I'd say more on the subject but I'm
afraid you might have to scroll and I'd hate to burden you with such an
onerous task.
