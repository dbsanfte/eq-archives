Ah, yes, and Quiescence magically drops into the lap of each and every 
shaman when they hit level 65.  You can just about count on any level 65 
druid to have their best incomplete heal, that is most definitely not the 
case for a shaman and Quiescence.  Heck, I only just recently picked up 
Torpor, and that sucks with the snare and slow component for healing 
melee types.  Not to mention, druid ICH at level 64 is 7.8 to 1 hp to 
mana ratio, and Quiescence is 6 to 1 hp to mana ratio.  Even if you 
squeeze an extra tick out of Quiescence, it's still 7.5 to 1.  It does 
not stack with the better cleric heal over time spells either.

So, yes, I still say a druid is a better healer than a shaman.
