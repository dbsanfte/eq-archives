Well sure, of course they do.  Unfortunately, there is a double
standard at work here much of the time.  Tanks are often expected
to be far better equipped and/or AA'd then other group members.
This is especially true (afaict) in most every popular crap-loot
XP or good loot if you can pop a named zone.

These same folks who were, in effect, PL'd through PoV or whereever
on the backs of their tanks go on to insist on NBG loot rules when
they finally take their crap-geared selves to places where loot is
possible.  Or, they'll insist on "full random" of the 30k tradeable
goodie when they take down the named that would be 100% certain to
wipe them if their tank didn't have 10x (or more) the time invested
in gear/level/AAs that they have.

So, regardless of how reasonable the request is when it comes from
reasonable people, it's at least as likely, if not more likely,
to be coming from the same parasites who refused to group with the
tank (ad/or his brothers/sisters) in places where he could work at
upgrading his gear so that he could become strong enough to do a
decent job tanking in the "great XP" or "awesome loot" spots where
they're demanding well geared tanks.

Davian's at one end of this, he's the decently geared tank who's
offended at the implied slight to his competence from parasites
who expect him to carry their group, and I'm at the other as the
casual tank who can't carry their group and can't get support to
group where I can work at becoming strong enough to tank the good
stuff.  But we're annoyed at the same group of players for the
same self-serving behavior.
