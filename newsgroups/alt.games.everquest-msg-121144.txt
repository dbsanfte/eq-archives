Good, you should.  Here's the relevant link to Zeb's server ezboard
where the topic was discussed and I read it back in May.

<http://pub41.ezboard.com/fthecrossroadstavern8833frm8.showMessage?topicID=1
299.topic>

There's been a couple of prominent discussions about name
changes and name policy on the boards there over the last month
or so.  A guildie of mine had their name changed.   They're actually
now "immortalized" in the Naming Policy.... ;)   Obviously, we'd
discussed that (and the fact that the Naming Policy listed isn't the
final copy that made it online) on the guild's ezboard.   I'd link that
too but it's in a private forum...

And since my posting history on Google shows posts where I've
discussed the name policy on a.g.e before (as well as my main's
residence on Zeb), I'd say you'd have lost that bet...
