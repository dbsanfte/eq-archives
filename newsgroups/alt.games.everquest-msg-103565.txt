Logging off the server (or zone) is what clears the aggro.   For most
characters, camping is the fastest way to do this.    A character that /quits
will keep whatever aggro he has *until he finishes timing out* at which point
he will lose it.    The time out period is several minutes, compared to a 30
second camp time.

Monks and shadowknights (and necros) use it since while they are feigned
death, they have no aggro.  Going linkdead (/q) keeps them in the non aggro
feign death position until they timeout, at which point it is completely
cleared (when they log back in they can stand up and not get it back).   So
they can use it in pefect safety, even though it takes longer.   For everyone
else it is less likely to succeed than just camping.
