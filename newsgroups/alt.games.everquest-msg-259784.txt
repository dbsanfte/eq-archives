Eldritch rune is worth it... definitly for xping too.
When your first rune is gone, and your being wailed on, an instant 1500 pt 
rune is hard to beat.
Saved my ass so many times now. Definitly one of the best aa's available. It 
recharges quickly too.

As for Uproar, 8 slots arnt enough to justify it, so I never use it under 
normal conditions. Arcane rune stays memmed always, of course.
