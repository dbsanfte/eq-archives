Oh, they can do it no matter what they get on zone in if they are
patient and careful, keep a druid in the group, and have a good chanter.
If they get swarmed, they simply kill as many as they can on the first
go until it looks like somebody is going to die, then have the druid
evac them to Free Rot to clear aggro, run back in, rinse/repeat until
break area cleared. Sometimes we get lucky and get it on one shot,
sometimes it takes two or three zones.
