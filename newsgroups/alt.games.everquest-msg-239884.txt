1. Accounts are available only to adults or, in their discretion, their
minor child. If you are a minor, your parent(s) or guardian(s) must complete
the registration process, in which case they will take full responsibility
for all obligations under this Agreement. By clicking the "I Accept" button
and providing us with a credit card number, you represent that you are an
adult and are either accepting this Agreement on behalf of yourself or your
child. You may not transfer or share your Account with anyone, except that
if you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one child to use the Account
instead of you (in which case you may not use that Account). You are liable
for all activities conducted through the Account, and parents or guardians
are liable for the activities of their child. Corporations and other
entities are not eligible to procure Accounts.
