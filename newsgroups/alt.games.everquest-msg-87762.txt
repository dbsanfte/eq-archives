Depends on religion, too.  I hope you're agnostic, although the Outpost
itself is on Venril Sathir faction and I don't think old-world religion is
as
important to them.  Best BEST BESTEST test is to hop the shuttles to
ogre island in the Tim. Deep, and /con the first ogre you see while having
the illusion up.  If he's dubious or better with illusion up, you'll be fine
as long as you don't ride the boat all the way to the docks in OT.

Why?

Because you can't cast the illusion ON the Bloated Belly, and the
undead guard on the docks sees through invis and will aggro you
before you have time to step on the docks and finish your illusion.

Lordee I miss the insta-cast illusions...

Faction hits are faction hits.  The difference being that if your illusion
causes you to be better liked, you can still take advantage of that faction.
Case in point...my half-elf is dubious to the Dread Guard Outer (guards
in Nek forest), but ally as a dark elf.  If I started killing them, my
faction
would quickly get to KOS as a half elf, while slipping from ally to kindly
and warmly and amiable and indifferent and dubious and finally KOS in
DE form.  The faction hits are still the same faction hits, but my "base"
faction is much better as a Dark Elf (and as an Erudite, too...go figure....
dubious as half-elf, ally as dark elf, kindly as Erudite, and indifferent as
an Iksar...how's that for weird? :-)  ).

No.  Only stats are from the mask itself (Erudite adds CHR and AGI,
for instance).  You DO however inherit some of the races' pros and cons,
though.  Ultravision and smaller size as a DE are big plusses for barbarian
rogues, while I didn't like  using my Erudite mask a lot until I got a Mrylo
helm because I lost my normal race infravision (helm has Ultravision
right-click).  Erudites are f'ing blind.  What I DO like is being able to
see over a crowd now when fighting in multi-group encounters :-).

Good luck to you!
