Except the CoH devs haven't done that.

You can call it what you want, that doesn't make it real.
You get the exp you earned.  Nothing he does can take that away from
you.  You are simply saying "I took hits and was planning to kill that
mob, therefor it's exp belongs to me and he stole it."

Your plans are irrelevant.  Your belief you "own" the mob is irrelevant.
This isn't EQ, and that's not how it works here.

You "own" nothing but your door missions.
Get it, NOTHING on the street is owned by anyone, regardless of what you
want to believe.
All your beliefs, expectations and fantasies won't change that FACT one
little bit.
Everything on the street is open season and only player politeness stops
people from attacking things someone is already fighting.

Different game, different mechanics, different rules, different customs,
different conventions.

Yes Killstealing as defined as a player who CAN RECEIVE NO EXPERIENCE
for the mob he kills that was being fought by another player.
That's it, that's the ONLY form of kill stealing that is recognized in
CoH.


Slight correction: if someone is doing it to you REPEATEDLY, you can
petition it for harassment.  Just as you could petition someone
following you around and doing anything to your character.
This would require you to tell them to leave you alone, and them to
deliberately follow you.

Except you're holding up a turnip and calling it a rose.

No, repeated behavior that interferes with another player is harassment
and this may include what you think of as kill stealing.

The crux is _REPEATED_, not killsteal.

Someone "steals" one kill, you haven't been harassed.

CS needs to be savy of nothing more than the rules and regulations
governing the game they are serving.

Random unreasonable expectations brought in by people who came from
another game and can't be bothered learning the rules, regs, and mores
of this game aren't their purpose.
They're there to deal with REAL problems, not your imagined slights and
for all your whining, bitching, and creative snipping, that's what it
comes down to.

You want CS to bend over backwards to use YOUR DEFINITIONS, and assume
that every whiner actually has a real and valid complaint; you don't
care how CoH does things, you want it EQ style.

If EQ is so damn perfect what the fuck are you playing CoH for?

So instead of actually expecting players to LEARN the rules and mores of
THIS game CS should assume they're all a bunch of incompetent lazy
fuckwits who are assuming it's just like the last game they played and
spend time questioning them intensively to get them to say what they
really mean?

Gee what a waste of time and money.

And this would have helped in the KDragon situation exactly how, since
KDragon logged off IMMEDIATELY upon being told there's no kill stealing?

KDragon fucked up and complained about something that's not against the
rules.  WHY?  Obviously KDragon couldn't be bothered actually LEARNING
what the rules are.

KDragon didn't bother trying to explain the situation (which would have
made it clear it was a harassment issue) KDragon just hung up and quit
then sent a nasty note to tech support after closing his account.

Quite frankly the whole story paints KDragon as a petulant little whiner
that bailed as soon as CS didn't read his mind to know what he really
meant.
KDragon leaving is no loss to the CoH community, none at all.

Some people don't like being confrontational and won't say anything to
that person. [Though they're quite likely to bitch about it to friends
over another channel.]

I was trying to keep things polite.  Arrogant Asshole doesn't have the
same ring to it that sparky does, though that's certainly what you
appear to be with your insistence that CoH bend to your wishes and
definitions.
