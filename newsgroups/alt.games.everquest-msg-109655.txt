Problem is, there is nowhere to run to, when you're at the combine ruins.  I
know, if there's no way out, you shouldn't be fighting, but this pretty much
means "Don't explore, don't go see the world, stick to your nice safe
leveling havens."  Bah.  I fled the leveling grind in DL specifically for
that reason.  Maybe I should play a bard main, instead of a paladin main,
but I rather think the game shouldn't encourage that mentality.

Oh, I agree wholeheatedly, but for those who get tired of the "approved
path," Verant has only included disincentive.  Play it nice and safe, and
you'll get ahead, take risks, and you'll get mashed, and have little to show
for it.  My guild insists on proving our tag (Tempters of Fate), still it
would be nice if it weren't so costly, or if there were at least rewards
commensurate with the risk.
