It wouldn't much, but a dwarf cleric is more likely to be a semi-tank
than any other race; take a look at dwarf cleric stats and you'll
see a decent strength and stamina package.  You might also expect
at low levels to see the dwarf cleric going LOM faster than High
Elves etc, due to a much lower starting wisdom.

Halfling and DE clerics have some hide and sneak capabilities
which can give them the edge in being nominated as puller.

DE clerics in particular may have a symbol which lets them
cast snare without spending mana or a spell slot; snare coupled
with fear puts the whole game in a very different light.

High Elf clerics tend to be the most fragile of the lot, wimpy
strength and low stamina mean that they may actually need
the sort of protection many people tend to instictively lavish
on the class... or they may not, they still  have access to
plate armor and a full array of cleric buffs, including from
34 up the Velious self only HP/AC buff that stacks with the
rest of their line.

Gnome clerics, you have to figure are there mainly in the hopes
of looking up barbarian female (male?) kilts...

Sure, its not the biggest indicator, but I thought I'd throw it in there

as an illustration of the diversity you might see within the class.
