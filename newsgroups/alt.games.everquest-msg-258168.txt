Yes, eww, I know.

I finally went to the DMV and got a driver's manual, under the assumption
that it would reflect the current laws.  I figure if I've been in err all
this time I wanted to know.

But it was quite simple. In the section telling you how to merge it says
"traffic on the highway has the right of way".

How can you be more straightforward than that? It doesn't say "they have
the right of way, but if you can pull ahead of them they no longer have
the right of way".  Just "traffic on the highway has the right of way".

Then I realized...the LAW isn't that you have to let anyone in.  The
reason folks do that is because the *insurance companies* have decided
that the person in the back will be held accountable.  Has nothing to do
with the law at all.  Unless the official DMV handbook is inaccurate.  If
that's the case, well, you'll have to take that up with Arnold. :P
(Seeing his picture in the front gave me a the willies.)

I suppose the insurance companies need some "easy" way to determine who is
at fault in any highway accident, in absence of witnesses, but man it is
annoying when the law and the insurance practices are at odds.
