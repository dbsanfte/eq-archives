I've said it before and I'll say it again. Any trade skill can be profitable
if you work your market well.

Me, I took up fletching, put every copper I had into it, lots of fun too. At
one point I started making bows and the skill has not cost me a copper ever
since. In fact, I'm making money hand over fist.

I'm convinced that this goes for every trade skill. You just need to know
what to sell where and what a fair price is, learn the art of haggling and
be creative with your auctions and polite to your customers.

A usefull tip, having tried every skill out there, the ones where you can
buy everything  you need are the easiest to learn. Fletching is no trouble
at all. You can get from 0 to 200 by sitting on you ass all day long.
Tip two, while getting the pelts for the tailoring skill is hell, the
rewards are bountyfull. You can make handmade backpacks at a relatively low
skill level and if you hunt yourself, the cost is virtualy nothing and they
sell for 100pp.
