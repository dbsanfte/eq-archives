OK, I finally got my high elf wizard to level 12, which means I've got bind
affinity and can go where I darn please and not worry about dying too far
from where I'm bound (assuming a little care and forethought on my part).
For the life of me, I have not been able to find/purchase the level 12
combat spells (GFay), but I did come across a Lexicon and some spell books.
As far as I can tell, you just locate the appropriate runes, either from
merchants or whereever, put them in the lexicon, combine them and out pops a
fresh new spell to add to you spellbook.  Of course, I haven't found a
combination of runes that will result in a low enough level of spell that it
has any use to me yet.  OTOH, those selling the Lexicon were also selling
quill and ink. So...

Are there steps I need to know about, or did I basically get it right?

How reliable is this process (runes are expensive)?

Does my level/experience play a part in using this?

I vaguely recall something about "research" that I read somewhere.  Is this
it?


Thanks,
Eric
