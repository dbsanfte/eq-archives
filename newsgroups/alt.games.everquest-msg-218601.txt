I found it quite easy to solo long before I got my first pet.  I actually 
started out soloing in a less efficient way, nuke kiting single yellow 
mobs.  I just didn't know any better at the time, and it worked quite 
nicely.  Shaman was my first, and only character I levelled over 30.

Shaman best slow is 75% vs 70% for enchanter, 65% for beastlord, not 
exactly what I would call best slow by far, but, certainly the best.
