I read all the great opinions that most of the EQ kiddies have concerning
this guy. So guess what, I now have derived my own thoughts concerning this
person and the tragic events.

Weak personalities are exactly that. Be they a result of genetic
predisposition or years of abuse at the hands of others. I come from a
family that exhibits certain signs and like most of you lovely gentle people
out there, I have made the move to intervene in order to save that family
member from themselves.

Doesn't always wok folks! No matter what the addiction, it is an ingrained
personality or physiological trait. You can't blame the bullet on the gun or
the gun on the shooter. Addictive personalities will become addicted to
anything, unless they are totally aware and cognitive of their addictive
aspects.

I could be an alcoholic, meth., crack or downers freak, sexual addict or
anything else for that matter. But ultimately all the responsibility is
mine.

I have removed my children from games because I have watch the physiological
changes during game play; ie. stress, irritability, anxiety, Grand Mall
seizures. The drive to beat the game can be very compelling. But the
willingness on the Dad's part to beat the crap out of you if you continue to
play can also be motivating.

If you see people with an addictive issue, interceed, bring it to their
attention. If they refuse help or blow you off, at least you know you tried
something.

And for God's sake, STOP FRIVILOUS LAWSUITS over this kind of shit. Mourn
your loss and move on, just as if they had stepped in front of a bus over
loosing their $100K a year job during a recession.

Peace, Love and EQ forever. ( M-F 9pm-12am PST only)
