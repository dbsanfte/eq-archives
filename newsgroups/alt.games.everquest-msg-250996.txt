Mac users *are* justifiably upset by this.

Microsoft wanted the VPC product for its own legacy windows support / 
compatibility issues, not the Mac support. They got the Mac version as 
part of the package, but its not the application they're interested in, 
but its an integral part of the VPC technology and it really can't be 
separated out. They might neglect it to death while they focus on the 
parts they are interested in, but that's not the same as buying it for 
the purpose of killing it.

 From a mac user's perspective though, it would be the same end result.

Its sort of like getting a goldfish with a new computer as part of a 
package deal, and then forgetting to feed the fish until it dies because 
you never even took it out of its packaging.

You didn't buy the computer to kill the fish, but that won't console the 
fish much.
