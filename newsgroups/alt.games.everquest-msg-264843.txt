I have no idea how it works now, but I do know that my trader, a low
level wizard, never regained his mana when he went hungry and thirsty.
That was standing, not sitting (don't think I tested that), but it was
quite noticeable when he ran OOM once and weeks later was still OOM.
I haven't gone hungry on any character since then long enough to
notice.
