Your guys fault I'm sure, you must have pulled her off her pop spot deep
down when you ran out.  Once she's off her pop spot she wanders around
killing everything in the zone.

I ran into her once with my cleric alt while I was grouping. 
fortunately I've got a lv 54 enchanter, and one of the groupies had a lv
54 ranger, so we showed up and kicked her ass.  She's lv 50, way
underconned with about 10k hp, think she's an SK or Necro as well, drops
nothing, she didn't resist worth crap though and is mezable/stunnable. 
Let me tell you - I was tempted to charm her and lay waste to the zone,
but my group wanted to just get her out of the way so we could go back
to killing yard trash.  

I've heard there's certain races that aren't KOS to her, but not sure
what.

She doesn't just pop up, she wanders the zone once she's off her pop
spot until killed or depops (supposedly) after a few hours, once you see
her it's time to leave till the next day unless you have a high lv who
can come whack her.

Still not as annoying as a certain DE in EC...  At least someone has to
train her to make her wander the zone and go berzerk.
