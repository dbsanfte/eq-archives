Actually *any title with an account key for online play* should be 
approached carefully. This includes things like Quake 3 and Halflife and 
Diablo 2 -- where you might not be able to play online if someone else 
(the previous owner and his friends for example) has the CD key.

Some titles, Tribes 2 comes to mind, also have 'accounts' with passwords 
tied to the CD key. The games are free to play and not MMORPGs, but fat 
lot of good it does you if you don't have the username/password that was 
created with that cd key.

And finally there are paid subscription games (NFS motor city, Sims 
online, planetside, which are exactly like mmorpgs for 
accounts/cdkeys/subscriptions... but of couse they aren't mmorpgs.
