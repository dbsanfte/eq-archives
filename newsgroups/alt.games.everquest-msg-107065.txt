  Making a criticism isn't the same as "losing your temper".  And his
criticism is perfectly valid.  When providing customer service and support,
it's always a good idea to create the impression you've reviewed of the
information the customer has already provided.  It makes the customer feel
as if their painstakingly detailed petition hasn't been ignored, and saves
them the trouble of having to repeat themselves.  "Hi, my name is Guide
Soandso, is there anything I can help you with?" is a canned greeting, I
don't really know what else you could call it.  It's an answer that a Guide
could give to ANY petition and there isn't anything personal about it, and
does not relate at all to whatever issue the player says he or she is
having.

  Maybe, maybe not.  So far, I've received canned responses to every
petition I've ever logged that I can remember, so my presumption is that
this is the way Verant trains its Guides and GMs to answer them... in which
case you can't really blame the individual Guides, who, as you mentioned,
are just volunteers, the majority of which don't deserve half the criticism
they have leveled towards them.  That doesn't mean there isn't room for
improvement in the way they are trained and in the way they do their jobs.
