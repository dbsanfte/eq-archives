I had this same problem with torches and lightstones. People suggested that 
I need to fix my gamma, but I was sure that isn't the case. Then one member 
of my guild remembered that Dynamic Light might be set off. You need DL on 
from options to see in pitch black areas if you are a human holding a 
lightsource. Otherwise that area will remain black. 

There is an ingame option to turn it on, that is what I used. (had to zone 
for it to take effect) I can't remember what it was, but it works if you 
camp and change it from the options menu in the login screen.
