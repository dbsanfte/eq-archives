I am a 38th season Druid and am looking forward to getting my 39 spells.
However after waiting 15 levels for a new Root spell (24 to 39), I am very
disappointed with the level 39 Enveloping Roots.  The whole point of root to
me is to use it with my DoT spells.  Well enveloping lasts 1 minute and the
level 24 Ensnaring Roots lasts 1.6 minutes.  The additional damage from
Enveloping is trivial compared to the damage I will do with an additional 36
seconds from my DoT spells useing the old Ensnaring spell.

Please tell me I am missing something.  A fifteen level wait for a
less-effective spell is bumming me out!

Jocund,
Halfling Druid 38
