[forgery deleted]

If anyone wants to get that idiot in trouble:

1. His IP address is 24.28.86.26.  Just open a DOS window and type

	ping -t 24.28.86.26

and leave it running while you play EQ or whatever.  If enough people do
that, he'll get the message that annoying large numbers of people is not
wise, perhaps.

2. He's running a web server at http://24.28.86.26/, which is in
violation of his ISP's terms of service, so anyone who wants to take the
time to follow up on that can get his cable modem taken away.

It's not smart to do stupid net tricks from a semi-static IP address.
