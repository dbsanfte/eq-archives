Read the entire thread. I stated quite clearly that I did as well for 
quite some time. That doesn't change the fact that SoE's business 
practices are optimized for squeezing every last dime they can out of the 
customer, moreso than any other game publisher with whom I've ever dealt.

No need to take offense. If it's still worth the price of admission in 
your opinion, then more power to you. I used to feel the same way.
