    Then start farming Emperor key / Shissarbane weapon ore / lucid shards.
No, really. When you get to that stage of the game you'll be a lot happier
that you did it now, when you had "nothing to do". Just send a tell to one
of my guildmates and ask them if they like Maiden's Eye. The Emperor key
pieces are actually quite easy to justify from a guild perspective, as a
(from memory) AC 5 STA/WIS/INT 4 HP 80 MANA 65 ring with a focus effect is
likely an upgrade for every single person in your guild. And if your
guildmates don't have their level 56/58 Luclin spells yet, they sure will
after you're done farming those key components. ;-)

    The thing pushing us on is VT, a zone with NOBODY else in it. So we have
the same problems. Our last Emperor attempt on Sunday, as we gathered and
went up the other guilds on the server killed both Rhags, Creator, AL, HP,
and Cursed cycle. At least there wasn't anything to distract us from shard
farming. =/

    No, we were 90%. It's an important distinction. As we found out with the
new UI on our Sunday attempt, having our wizards all manaburn near the start
of the fight takes Emperor down 5%. And Vis has more wizards than we do.
They tried again since I posted - 88%. So they're lasting until the first 4
K or stun proc, then falling apart based on how we progressed. From what we
found out going up with them to loot Blood, they have a looooong way to go
yet - they still use FFA groups!

    We got to make attempts on him a lot more often than they will, since
once we kill him they get no practice for a week. When we said "Emperor must
die" we were up there dying once every two days. We aren't at the stage
where it's a stable fight, so they get two attempts per week on average if
they try him post-patch then post-us wiping - and they haven't been trying
at every opportunity.

    About the same. We've killed Grieg with 26 or so people a loooong time
ago - once you get your placement and charming (oooh, spoiler alert!) set
he's quite routine. That fight with 26 people was pretty close, BTW. ;-)
