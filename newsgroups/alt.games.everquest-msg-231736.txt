I am thinking about the Puppet Masters(SOE and Blizzard).  Not the
development teams.  I do not think the developers of SWG wanted the game
pushed out the door last summer knowing the game still had stability,
content and class balance issues.  But their bosses, SOE, wanted it to ship
so it shipped.  I hope they learned a lesson from SWG.  Frankly I feel that
they took for granted their player base and shipped something that was
inferior to their reputation for game development.  Hopefully EQ2 will not
have this same problem.

I will lose a lot of respect for Blizzard if they do the same with WoW and
push it out too soon.  With the past projects that Blizzard has done I
seriously doubt that will happen.
