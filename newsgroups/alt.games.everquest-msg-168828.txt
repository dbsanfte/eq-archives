Yes, but if a bunch of different frames of reference are equally relevant, 
a wise debater would specify which they're using.

}I've noticed that

}campfire, or the "government is a neccessary evil, but evil none the less"
}campfire.  From there, any one policial mixture in any nation can be similar

I see a lot more than two campfires.  But they tend to be plagued by the 
idea that only two campfires have candidates with a shot at winning.  And 
most of the other campfires don't like either of the main campfires very 
much, and end up flipping a coin or basing their decision on some one 
specific issue without regard to an overriding party philosophy.

All right, let's make up some numbers:  I'll bet you 98% of both 
conservatives and liberals in this country disapprove of fascism or 
anything like it.  However, the 2% of conservatives are clearly 
statistically insignificant, therefore, 2% -more- liberals love fascism!  
Those dang fascist liberals!  Now, if we substitute authoritarian rather 
than fascist, we might be able to get some actual numbers... hm, well, no, 
the only number I can find is that according to this poll:

http://www.self-gov.org/poll1208_libertarian_litmus_test2_b.htm

14% of respondents were of an authoritarian bent.  The other interesting 
number there is that the 16% who are libertarian and the 32% who are 
centrist were equally distributed throughout the Democratic and Republican 
parties.

They do not specifically say, but I bet authoritarians followed the same 
pattern.

}> }> From dictionary.com:

}> }If you take the modern liberal's views, they tend towards fascism.

}Then would the really be considered liberals in America?  Or would they find

Most of them would be appalled that you'd consider classing them as 
conservatives.  Those that pick a party are mostly Green with occasional 
Democrats and Libertarians.  But if asked, they would say they are liberal 
rather than conservative.

Hey, it's -clean- mud, ok? :)
