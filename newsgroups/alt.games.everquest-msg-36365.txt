Actually, only 2/4 of the items are no drop.  The Koalindl Fish and Erud's
Tonic are both no drop.  You can, however, transfer Kiola Nuts and Honey Jum
between PCs.  You can purchase several Kiola Nuts at a time and store them in
the bank, but Honey Jum is a lore item and you can only carry one at a time.
