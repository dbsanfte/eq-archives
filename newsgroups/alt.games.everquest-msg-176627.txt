Sorry to be the one that has to tell you this, but Iksar can't really wear
plate.

I'm not really familiar with Iksar SKs, as my SK is Human (yeah, I know).
But I do know that all non-Iksar SKs worked towards Dark Forge armour, but
your SK is an Iksar, so I presume you may be interested in looking for the
Dark Forge-equivalent "Dreadscale" armour. It's certainly not uber, but it
is a step in the right direction.

By the way, you are right - Netherbian Chitin can be worn by Iksar.
Depending on your STA, I would go with the Dreadscale BP. Sure, there is 2
less AC, but the HPs from the STA would easily make up the loss.

Now before someone tries to correct me - yeah - I know Iksar can wear some
plate-type armour... but, that doesn't count. The plate limitation is
sometimes left out simply to reduce the work the designers had to do. :b

Hopefully that little bit helps, and good luck with the Shadow Knight.
