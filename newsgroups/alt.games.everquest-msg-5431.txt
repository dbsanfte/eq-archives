I've never heard of anything like this, but I myself wouldn't trust
it. To play your character, he would have to have access to your
account. No telling what he would do once he had that. Not to mention
the hundred bucks you just gave him. Of course, for all I know, he
might be legit. If that's the case I wish him luck, but it's
definitely not something that I would do. If you think that you can
trust this guy, and if you are willing to part with that much money,
then by all means, do it. Just be aware of the possible consequences
(including possible actions by Verant if they find out about it...I
don't know what their policy on stuff like this)
