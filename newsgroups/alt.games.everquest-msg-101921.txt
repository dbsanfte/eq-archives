But slow as hell, it's limited by the spawn and drop rate
of the orcs/gnolls, and I haven't noticed that the
faction-ups are significantly larger than any other
FPMilitia faction quest.

Correct.  But unlike the other faction quests, it can be repeated
about as fast as you can click your mouse button.

Actually, that does* make it worthwhile.

Please support your assertion that it is an "exploit" and that
"Verant frowns on it".

In the several years that people have been doing the quest this way,
and it has been described and discussed on countless EQ forums,
I have never, ever, ever seen anyone report any disapproving statement
from Verant on the matter, nor anyone who had ever been so much as
warned about using it.

It uses basic game mechanics to make something a bit easier,
it's no different from pulling a mob away from his "friends"
before attacking him.

And it's not like it makes the quest trivial when you
reposition Slansin -- it still takes several HOURS of
questing (and a carpal-tunnel-syndrome-inducing amount of
clicking) to accomplish significant amounts of faction changes.
It makes the quest no more efficient than other "feed the NPCs"
faction quests, like the "Muffins for Pandos" quest in West Freeport,
or the "Red Wine for Lokar" quest in Neriak Third Gate.
Those quests are *designed* to be done standing in one place,
cramming an NPC with trivially acquired (storebought) quest
items in a rapid-fire manner, so it's clear that Verant doesn't
actually have a policy against "machine-gun" style faction quests.

Furthermore, the quest seems practically designed to be done this
way, because all the factors are such that it's possible/easy to
do the quest, *and* there are any number of absolutely simple changes
Verant could make if they actually wished to block people from
doing this including:

1.  Make the guards assist Slansin (right now they don't give
a damn if you pull him, or even kill him).

2.  Make Slansin level 60, that way he'd cream anyone who tried
to pull him (right now he's incredibly low-level, he has always
been green to me).

3.  Move Slansin out into the Erudin zone instead of leaving him
in the Erudin Palace zone where Toresian (the giver of the quest)
resides, so that people would have to zone between quest cycles
(like they currently do for the Janam/Rebby letter quests).

4.  Make Slansin "unhailable", so he can't be held in place by
hailing him.

5.  Make Slansin "unpullable" (many mobs in EQ are now unpullable,
including the spire Scions and all the NPCs in the Nexus and the
Bazaar).

...and so on.  The fact that Verant has opted not to make any
of these changes seems a clear enough indication that they
don't have a problem with the quest being operated the way
it currently is.

Apprehensive to Amiable is a rather small range (no more
than 200 points of increase, even if you started at the
lowest possible "Apprehensive" -- 100 if you were high Amiable).

And your corresponding A.S. drop was at least 850 points
(low warmly to high dubious).

I doubt you could use this method to recover from deep KoS status
with the FP Militia without becoming fully KoS to the
Knights of Truth (which puts a crimp in Freeport banking)
and the Arcane Scientists.
