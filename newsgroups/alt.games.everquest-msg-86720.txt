    The well-equipped level 60 monk I was grouped with for AoW has parsed
himself at 100 DPS against blue cons from the front. Khanos would count as
one of the senior monks in the second-best guild on the server, but you did
say "well-equipped". And when "well-equipped" for a monk means a 16/19 and a
17/20 weapon....
