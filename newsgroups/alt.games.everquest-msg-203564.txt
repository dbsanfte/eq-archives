/laughs and points.

Got news for you.  My Paladin soloed in UGuk from Level 16, gaining
17, 18, and 19 in there.  Solo.  Not grouped.  All alone.  Later I did
a lot of soloing in LGuk, pulling to zone from as far as the bedroom
when it was unoccupied.  Wanna know the secret to soloing low levels
in Guk?  Don't hunt the live frogs.

When I hit 42, I paid 1300 Plat for the best piece of equipment I've
ever bought - Deepwater Helm.

When I hit 45, soloing became *much* easier for me, and I proceeded to
do so a lot in GD and FV.  Not with uber-buffs, such as KEI; just with
my little old Paladin buffs.

At Level 48, I finally started getting new armour, switching out my
Fine Plate for Dwarven Plate as I created it.  Got rid of my last
piece of Fine Plate when I was 49.  In that time I bought KEI 3 times,
always for use while I was smithing.

Anybody who thinks that they absolutely must have KEI is nuts.  At 28,
my Druid was able to solo Ulthork Warriors (34 to 36).  Admitted, only
one spell (Crud) would stick to the bloody things, and he'd have to
run all over Hell's half acre to stay away from a very annoyed (and
un-Snared) critter, but he could do it.  Of course, if he got 2, it
was "Hiyo Zoney, away!".

It also doesn't give the only thing I've ever wanted from KEI, a
massive increase in my Wisdom.  Brilliance (?), the next spell down,
anyway, does a piss-poor job with only a 7 increase.
