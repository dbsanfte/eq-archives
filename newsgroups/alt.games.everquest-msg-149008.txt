Got my bard on Firiona Vie up to 14 and have a couple of questions:

1. At what level should a bard begin to kite mobs? I tried with
Brusco's and even CoD and got my stuff handed to me each time. Trouble
was that with Brusco's hitting them, I can't use Selo's so they catch
up to me and beat me up. Then of course with CoD, you just about have
to be in melee range for it to land.

2. Speaking of Brusco's, these songs that only have an effect as long
as they are being sung (no residual two ticks of effects after
stopping singing them) don't seem to be meant for twisting with other
songs. Am I right here? I mean how are you suppose to twist a song
when its effect stops as soon as you stop singing it?

3. I know it's been debated forever, but has anyone got any good
information on how much affect CHA has on my songs? Is there maybe a
cap that as long as my CHA is that high I'm ok?

That's all for now. Tia.
