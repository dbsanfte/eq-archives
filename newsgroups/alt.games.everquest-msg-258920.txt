Only true for some games.

Even easy-to-play games like Diablo, Sacred, NWN, BG or KotOR needs a manual
for the user to beginning to understand the system underneath, so users know
what to choose/do inside the game.

And I wonder how many gamers can really understand the game without a manual
for these games:
Flight Simulator
Alpha Centauri / Alien Crossfire (the manuals are really great and worth
reading from cover to cover)
Civilization
