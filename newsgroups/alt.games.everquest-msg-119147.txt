One word: Logs. CS-kills are logged...

GM or Guide?

I would note that a screenshot bears zero weight as evidence in any
form of abuse petition. Too easy to alter.

Another note is a duel would have been consentual between the player
and the guide/GM. Against the rules, yes, and guides have been kicked
out of the program in the past for it. But, as it is consentual, far
less likely that it'll cause enough negative outcry to draw attention
to it and thus puts them at far less risk.

GM or Guide? Guide wouldn't have had access to the report, simply
persist until you talk to the server GM.

Of course, it's still all assumption, including the "the GM killed
Tunare!" part...

Sounds far more likely than the GM zapping her out of spite because
one person in the rade party was rude to them.

Just not something I hear a lot of, then. I recall how big a deal it
was when she first fell and talk of how insanely hard it was to take
her down...

Well, I'm just tossing alternate theories to what could have happened
on a raid I never have and probably never will participate in myself,
so I don't know the details of the mobs involved.

GMs put up with shit all day. It's their job. Guides put up with the
same, but voluntarily and for less time. One person in a party on a
major raid insulting them, no matter how bad the insult, is NOT going
to be enough to cause them to screw over the entire raid party and put
their own necks on the line. Unlike the dueling example, this IS
something that would very likely cause enough outcry to have the
matter looked into.
