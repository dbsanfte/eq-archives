I have killed so many crags I could puke, (my wife was working on her
tailoring). We killed a ton as a ranger druid pair, and then I soloed
them with my druid.

I think we started on them when I was a lvl 19 Ranger and she a lvl 17
druid, and quit when I was lvl 24 and she 22, (I think, it was a long
time ago).

I started killing them solo when my druid hit 19, quite honestly once
my wife hit 19 I was only snare insurance, and by 22 I was often running
after the spider chopping it from behind as it tried to run her down.
While it got boring hunting the same damn thing, I maxed my archery,
tracking, and fleching, ).

What I learned about crags: if they are blue, and you dont have SoW and
snare, or fear and snare, or a full/good group, -forget it- They hit very
hard and have a strong poison. It takes three casts of cure poison to
knock the poison off, very hard to do while kiting. You have to pull
them off to a safe place to kill them, the ramp is good, I also pulled
them to the river. You just need to pull them away from their buds. Adds
of extra crags or carrion spiders can be a real drag, not to mention the
occational griffawn or lion.

The good news, they drop tons of silk and give good exp, I have seen them 
drop 7 silks on a number of occasions. The bad news, many people know this
and you will find high level druids hunting them only for their silks,
(offset by the 22 level druids killing them for exp and leaving the
carcasses with silks intact).
