That's what the over priced "strategy guides" are for. :)

They're the manual that should have been in the box. (They sure don't 
contain much in the way of strategy information, after all, so they are 
generally a complete waste for anyone who has actually played the 
game... but they have all the information regarding tech trees, weapons, 
units, buildings, game types, etc that you would have expected to find 
in the -manual-.
