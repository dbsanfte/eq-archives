Sam, never said they suck. I know all the "pro/anti wizard" folks want
to chime in and paint anyone commenting on the subject on one side of
the fence or the other, but I didn't. The OP is a long time warrior. The
cautions I gave are well founded. The fact that it's a very hard to play
class, with very different challenges than a warrior, are well known. I
am guilded with, and often group with, a couple of high level wizards.
They rock. They are the only reason I got a shitload of experience on
our Kael raid yesterday when many people got none. But the facts are as
they are. Very different experience. If you want to go from a warrior to
a caster, unless you are *VERY* sure that wizard is the *only* class for
you, there are better choices to dip a toe in the casting pool, because
wizards are one hard assed class to play up to the high levels without
major league guild support.
