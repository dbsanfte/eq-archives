I have spare Ethereal and Spectral Parchments sitting
in my bank, and no one in my guild or friends list
needs them.

If I turn them in for spell scrolls to sell for cash
in the Bazaar, which class spells should I turn them
into in order to make the best return?  I.e., is there
a higher demand for, say, Enchanter 63-64 spells than
for Shadowknight spells, etc.?

I know I could check prices in the Bazaar, but that's
a *ton* of different spells to price-check.  I'm hoping
someone already knows a few good "moneymakers".
