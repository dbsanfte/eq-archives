Absolutely and completely incorrect.  Until you make it to 60, you have NO 
idea how big of a change it is.  It changes aggro, it changes resists, it 
changes how often and how hard you get hit.  There is no bigger 
improvement in the game than going from 59 to 60.  It's better than your 
epic, it's better than ToV gear, and it's a HELL of a lot better than a 
few AA points.
As to your contention that it's easier to get AA points at 54 rather than 
60, please share that crack pipe.  At 60 every mob level 45 and above is 
full blue or better.  (It maybe be even lower, I know that a level 45 
conned blue to me yesterday.)  At level 54 I *think* mobs 42 and higher 
give full exp.  Right there you have a bigger level range of blue, so more 
mobs.  Now we know that it take a set amount of exp to get an AA level.  
That level NEVER changes.  It takes the exact same amount of raw EXP to 
get an AA level if you're level 51 or level 60.  We also know that every 
mob of level X in a zone gives the same amount of exp.  So a level 45 mob 
give the same amount of EXP to a level 54 and a level 60.  If it take 100 
level 45 mobs to get one AA level, who do you think will kill those 100 
mobs faster, a level 54 or a level 60?  I'll give you a hint, it's the 
level 60, by a long, long way.  
To reiterate:  Any mob of a given level will give the same amount of exp 
in a given zone.  Any character will get the exact same EXP from a given 
blue-conning mob.  It takes the same amount of raw EXP to make an AA level 
no matter your level.
