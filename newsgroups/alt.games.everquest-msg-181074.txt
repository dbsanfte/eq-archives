I think the Mages have just as hard a time getting a group at 60 as the
other pet classes (ie. Necro and Beastlord).
Even tho the mage brings good sustained dps and can summon good items for
use in a group, i would never hesitate bringing a wizzie instead of a mage
if i were to go to eg. a dungeon. Why? As another poster here said.. Evac
and TL/ports after finish. Yeah.. it really suxors when time hits 2am and
you realize that you DO have to go to work in the morning at 7.. and have
just finished off the prince in chardok.. Perhaps that 30+ minutes extra
fighting back to the exit is not all that fun when you can ask a wizzie for
a TL to nexus?

And yes.. the wizzie can hold his damage just fine.. no matter how much your
mage pet quads for 70+.. And.. We all know how good pets react to those nice
aoe nukes when you are in ToV (Unless you got the pet discipline aa skill)
and will prolly need to kill the pet before the dragon is being pulled, thus
having to summon it every time the mt calls for a "pile in on the mob NOW!",
and the time it takes you to summon a pet, swap spells, summon some gear to
get it up to standards, the Wizzie have already done major damage to the
mob..

Just as a sidenote.. I can remember some whining about some mod rod nerf a
while back.. Think i wont quote much wrong with a "Mages were only good for
modrods.. now they cant even do that..That was the reason they would bring
us to raids"

So.. Ubah Nukah.. Perhaps not everyone agree with you on the "Mages are the
best evah" issue
