>> If you want to see la~ at its worst... starcraft is the big offender. <<

This is so true. I was stationed in Korea back in 2000, and the Koreans play
Starcraft like it's a religion. You cannot defeat a Korean in Starcraft, no
matter how hard you try. We even ganged up on one of our Korean buddies: 1
Korean vs. 6 soldiers. He wiped the floor with us.

Now if they could only apply that strategy to their army, maybe we could
pull our troops from there.
