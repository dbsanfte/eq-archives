I think there is some gray area, for example in who was actually conscious
of exploiting.  The guild claims none of them were aware they were breaking
the rules, and cite as evidence the fact that a GM watched the whole thing
and did not intervene until it became apparent they might win.  They also,
in a dialog with Brad McQuaide some days after, asked him to look at the
guild chat log.  They indicated they thought that he would realise they were
unaware they had been doing anything wrong if he would read what they said.

Whatever.  It's a very dead horse for us to beat here.  I am not saying they
should have been let off completely, but I do firmly believe the penalty
phase (to continue with the kangaroo court metaphor) was knee-jerk at best,
and  purely vindictive at worst.
