Let me see if I've got this right, some embassies in Africa were blown up by this
Osama Bin Laden guy who is rumored to be hanging out in Afghanistan so President
Blow-Job strafed the place with Cruise Missiles murdering many civilians. Many
militants over on that side of the world didn't like that response and were so
pissed off that they were willing to give their lives to strike back at the
American government. So they come over here and turn Boeing jets into cruise
missiles and succeed in striking at the heart of the American government.

Now basically the same evil, bloodthirsty clowns in the U.S. Government want to
strike back with bombs again. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again
and expecting a different result.

Perhaps they are not insane though? The FBI and Pentagon as well as the
intelligence agencies are always asking for more money and this bombing has them
all running around with their hat out asking for more with the implicit threat
that we had all better pay up or there will be more terror. The National Media is
on TV urging everything from bombing other countries to giving the FBI total power
to do what they want! Well, in addition to this being criminal behavior (terror
and EXTORTION) it is also a false problem.

Osama and his crew do not want anything that we have and we do not want anything
that he and his people have. There is no natural conflict between us, we do not
even live on the same side of planet Earth. This entire corrupt conflict revolves
around Israel and several government agencies that are totalitarian by nature
(Pentagon, FBI and CIA). Eisenhower warned us all about the Military Industrial
Complex on his way out as President. We have not listened. The mad boys of Ruby
Ridge and Waco are salivating in public with their machine guns and making
outrageous demands. The FBI has effectively shut down all air traffic even though
the threat has clearly passed. The FBI is destroying the American economy. They
have demanded to the FAA that an FBI agent be on every plane even though there are
about 10,000 active FBI agents (far too many) and 35,000-40,000 flights per day in
America (when the FBI allows the airlines to operate).

Take a good look at the head of the Pentagon, Donald "Twitchy" Rumsfeld who got
his start as a hard charging Young Republican in the Nixon Watergate
administration. He was trained under the paranoid Nixon-Kissinger "Coup D'etat"
administration. You might recall that Nixon/Kissinger thought that overthrowing
the obscure government of Chile would help win the "Cold War". Those two thought
that a Coup D'etat was the solution to any problem. These are Rumsfeld's teachers
and "Twitchy" Rumsfeld has that same glint in his eye and a heavy influence upon
America's number one dolt George Bush Jr.

Remember all that controversy that has surrounded the FBI for many years now? That
vanished fast on September 11, 2001 did it not? You should be worried about that
if you value your freedom.

America is still here. We are still free. That's more than the Chinese can say,
literally because the Chinese can't read this newsgroup, they can't post here.
Their government has reduced the Internet to an intranet. Almost the entire
Internet is firewalled off from the millions of Chinese who are online. It can
happen here. All it takes is your support of the Military Industrial Complex or
your apathy as it takes over our lives.

Soldiers on every corner and warrantless searches are next to ensure our "safety"
Our "news" broadcasts are already Orwellian. Rally around the flag to defend
against what the American Government, the Military Industrial Complex and Israel
created and you will lose it all.

The solution to our Osama problem is diplomacy. We have no conflict that cannot be
solved. The oil producing Arab nations need to do business with us so we have a
natural alliance with them, not antipathy. The conflict is Israel and neither they
nor we need Israel.
