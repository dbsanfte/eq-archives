Be aware, if reporting him, that theplanet.com is his ISP's upstream
provider.  Freeserve <http://www.freeserve.com> are his provider.

Actually, I'd be more inclined to pass details on to the likes of
piracy@whoever (e.g. MS, Blizzard, etc. depending on whose products
are apparently being made available) and let their legal teams take
all appropriate action.  There's always the outside chance that it's a
hoax, designed merely to get some innocent person into a lot of
bother.
