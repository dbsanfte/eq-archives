I think that's nice.

Resuming my postion as "Champion of Laziness", my wife and I have *both*
just barely made 54 prior to today's patch. he he. *smug look*.

I was SO in favor of this when I first heard about it, but now I'm
concerned. Didn't see the "will give you LESS experience" nerf coming.
But my question is, does the phrase "considerably weaker than you" mean
the light blues? Or does it also include those that are in the bottom
level or two of your "blue range". Because we tend to fight low blues
where possible. Just makes sense. I'd hate to see that get nerfed now.

The bards will finally be right up there with chanters for higer end
crowd control. I assume this means they will be able to now charm mobs
that are above the previous "charm cap" they had.

WOO HOO!

This one is going to tie in VERY significantly with the new stacking
stuff below.

Speaking as a wizard who very regularly groups with two necros, all I
can say is that I almost feel sorry for the mobs. The necros used to
have to chat ahead of time as to which one was casting which DOT, etc.
and plan that to avoid overwrites and such. Now they can double the
number of DOTs on each mob I pull. I may just give up on nuking. ;-)

This one has me VERY nervous, but we can only wait and see. *sigh*.

That would be nice. Haven't had full or reliable sound since the St.
Valentines Day Eve Massacre Patch.

> ** Pets **

All I can say is that they have certainly been giving a lot of attention
and improvement to the pet classes lately, and it's a very Good Thing.
This one below is nice:

Tarre most always has a bunch of Mardu Masks on her thanks to a 60 Mage
friend of ours. It's nice to know that the effects can stack, even
though her Rogue pet is already a frightenly destructive little bastard
in a fear kite.

WOO HOO! This will be SO FREAKING NICE for raid chat! Great improvement!

/sigh
Tell Hell just had an addition put on.

We shall see. I already got screwed out of a couple KPP on their last
"fix" of the wizard epic and the Truespirit faction boondoggle. But I'll
blindly act like a Verant Fanbois and go try again. Hell, it's only
money.

Ruht Roh, Shaggy. Hold me, I'm scared. Here's the promised "fix" to
Ragefire, with very little information given. Hrmmm....

Time will tell.

WOOT! Fix the idiots in the bazaar that overload their inventory! Also,
for people wanting to raid NPC vendors in newbie areas for tradeskill
stuff, less of a need to go vendor "trash diving". Nice.
