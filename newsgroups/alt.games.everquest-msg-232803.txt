What makes you think the material is copyrighted?  Seems to me it is a press
release intended for as much copying as you like.  Also, I'd like to make
the point that businesswire seems to take no responsibility for the
truthfulness of the press release.  They allow you to post anything.  So far
I have seen this information posted 3 times, and each time it is on a site
that cannot be held accountable for factuality.

"You agree that Business Wire will not be held liable for any improper or
incorrect use of the Site or the materials on the Site and assumes no
responsibility for any user's activities on the Site or for the inaccuracy
of any content on the Site. "
