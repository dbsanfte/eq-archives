Sorry, just really got to take exception to this. Not all of us are on
east-coast or europe time. Some of us are actually still at work at 3:30
in the afternoon, and don't have the opportunity to play everquest yet.
Making completely erroneous statements or posting non-sequiturs gives no
one, especially you, the right to act as if those who did not understand
your "codespeak" are somehow beneath you. All that was required was some
sort of an explaination. Your decision to belittle others in this group
was a poor one.
