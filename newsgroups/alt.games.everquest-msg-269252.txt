Hm, I've run into this a couple times.  And I wasn't able to fix
it in-game (e.g., there's some option about popups, and that didn't
affect it).  It turned out there was a Windoze "feature" that had
gotten turned on, that was interfering with EQ detecting mouseovers.

Problem is, I don't remember what it was.  I think it was triggered
by something like holding down SHIFT for too long, or CTRL, or some
such thing, and that popped up a box with various settings, and
fiddling with the settings fixed the problem.  And one of the things
I fiddled was to TURN OFF the "feature" so that holding down those
keys doesn't screw me over any more, so now I can't bring it back up
to see what exactly was involved!  Still, you could try holding down
one of those keys for ~10 seconds and see what you find.
