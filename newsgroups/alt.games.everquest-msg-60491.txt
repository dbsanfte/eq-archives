I bought EQ (ruins of kunark) for the second time yesterday and it installed
and updated without problem. However, when I ran it and clicked the New
Account button it immediately crashes to the desktop. I know its not the
installation disk, as I also tried using my old kunark installation disk and
have the same problem. It also crashes if I put in a made up username and
password and click connect.

I'm thinking the problem might be Win XP, but after searching this newsgroup
it seems most people are running without problem. I've tried several
different video drivers and am using the latest XP drivers for my SB Live.
I'm also fully updated from the Win update site and have tried running EQ in
compatability mode.

I've also tried running EQ without sound and with everything (zonealarm,
Norton AV 2002 etc) else shutdown. I could go back to Win 98 and hope EQ
gets better XP support with Luclin, but I thought I'd check to see if anyone
knew how to solve this problem before I did that! :)

Thanks :)
