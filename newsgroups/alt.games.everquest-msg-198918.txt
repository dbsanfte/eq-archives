Maybe find a REAL low damage weapon of the type you want to max out ( 
abandoned Orc Shovel for 2HB? ).  Fight a tough mob ( yellow / red ) with a 
regular weapon of the same skill, and when the mobs run, swap to the real 
low damage one and beat on them until they are almost dead, then stop and 
heal up and wait for them to come back and keep beating on them like this 
until your skills are up there.

Get that Dex up, too.
