It's not implemented yet on live Zek servers, despite the fact they haven't
removed that piece from the news.

If you want to play as a critter log into testeverquest.exe, create a
regular character (assuming you don't have one already), log in, log back
out, then the tiny "monster" button will work.   You'll SEE it the first
time you go to the character screen...it just won't work until you create a
regular char.
