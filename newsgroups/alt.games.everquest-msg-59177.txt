    It's fun. My ENCH does it all the time, although given how intent people
are to break her mezzes it's more an act of self-preservation. The best is
charming one part of a two spawn, slightly assisting your pet in killing the
other mob, then breaking charm and wasting the near-dead pet.

    Yes.

    Not unless you're one of those cheating NPCs. 8)

    At your level, it isn't as apparent, but think back to when you were
killing spectres in Oasis with Jakugg. Remember what they hit for? Ok, now
I'll tell you that the level 49 necromancer pet hits in the mid-50's max. So
which would you want for a pet? 8)

    As you level, your pet becomes less and less powerful relative to an NPC
of the same level. This is by design - if it were always as powerful as a
same-level NPC, it would be even more trivial than it is now to kill blues.
Charm allows you to take advantage of the superior abilities of a true NPC
pet, at the cost of unreliable loyalty. Here's a nice story to illustrate
what a charmed pet can do:

    A group of friends and I had made twinks to adventure together, and had
arrived in Freeport off the boat. It was late, so I suggested we relax after
binding by duelling in the arena in WFP. Me (ENCH), husband (ROG) and wife
(DRU), and one other (WAR) went to the arena after binding - I made sure to
get there first. As soon as the druid hopped down, I Charmed her. She
started self-buffing, so nothing looked amiss. When the rogue hopped down, I
Tashed him to get him angry. He took one poke at me, and my near-infinite
mana druid pet nuked him into a cinder. Repeat with WAR.

    Now can you see where a pet can come in real handy? Think of some of the
targets that an undead charm could take over (level permitting - charm
spells have limits on the maximum level critter they can charm, usually):
Ghoul WIZ mobs in Lower Guk. Festering Hags in Unrest. Drybone Skeletons in
Oasis. Enjoy your new spell, and be ready for when it breaks! 8)

    James
