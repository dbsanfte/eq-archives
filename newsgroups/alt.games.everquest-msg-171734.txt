What I meant is that a decently geared Warrior has a better chance of
"getting lucky" with aggro post mez.  Assuming he stands between the mob
and the 'chanter and the Ranger/Druid in group has snared during mez like
they should.  I know I've jumped the gun breaking mez a few times, had the
mob make a beeline for the 'chanter and had a lucky proc turn it back to
me.

Unaugmented by AA or items SoV/VoG is 42 mins, WR is 10 mins.  You Do The
