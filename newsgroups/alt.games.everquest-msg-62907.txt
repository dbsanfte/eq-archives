After downloading this I erased the silly little parser I had started
writing.  Log Parser 0.9 is so feature rich that it makes me a little
dizy.  Or maybe that is my natural state.  Whatever.

One thing I would like to see added is persistance.  That is, for each
character a little database is maintained of info that makes sense to
keep track of such as current skill level, and maybe stat summaries by
level.  Then you can parse your logs each day (and delete them), go to
a screen where you select the character, and be presented with a set
of reports which contain info on that char for its entire history to
date.

Bravo!!!
