I think a lot of people would like to see this "medium" setting (I sure
would have).  Although I figure  this would be too hard to implement, I
would like to have two scales to select when picking an adventure - mob DPS
and mob HP's.  A setting of 1 would be the equivalent to LDoN normal and 5
would be LDoN hard.  Adjust the points based on the scales selected.
