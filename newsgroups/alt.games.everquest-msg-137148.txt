The point is, that since there is a policy in place that forbids a
mentor of the type that could be sexually attracted to the mentee (as
in the case of a male mentor and a female mentee).

That being the case, why are those in the homosexual lifestyle exempt
from that policy?

Oh yea, that's right..  Special rights...

I did many times over.  

But, like with all your other discussions, you simply choose to throw
the proof handed to you, even though it is 100% accurate and
factual...

But it IS policy... regardless of whether YOU (big mighty PC type)
think it works or not, the POINT is, it IS policy...

So why are those in the homosexual exempt from the policy??

Oh that's right.... SPECIAL RIGHTS....

No, they are not.  Those who have a sexual attraction to males are
MENTORING boys.  Those who have a sexual attraction to females are
MENTORING girls...

That violates the policy.. But it's allowed because the militant PC
types have everyone so damn scared of offending the mighty loony
left..

Therein are your SPECIAL RIGHTS...

You haven't proven anything..

I have proved you wrong over and over again..  Foamy has proved you
wrong over and over again...

YOU are the only one who thinks you are right...

And when you can't argue the logic of the post, you attack the
author...

Typical...
