From what little I heard... Someone was already suspicious of it...  DLed
it... It wanted to know the link to your Everquest.exe file...  So he
renamed a copy of 'notepad.exe' to Everquest.exe, pointed the program to
it...

Apparently, it is a keylogger, designed to capture your login information,
then tease you into getting out just long enough for the scammer to try and
get into your account and rape you before you know it.
