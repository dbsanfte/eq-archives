Precisely... mana pool is almost an on/off. Either you have enough or 
you do not. Finishing the fight at 5% or 30% isn't really relevant, 
providing you *can* finish the fight... but if your finding yourself 5% 
short then you've got to bump your pool up a bit or tweak your strategy.

But all mana pool does is limit the absolute scale of a single 
encounter. A greater mana pool raises that limit a bit, but it makes no 
real difference for most of the game.

For a specific raid mob, however depending on how long its going to take 
it down... mana pool size may be more important then mana regeneration.
