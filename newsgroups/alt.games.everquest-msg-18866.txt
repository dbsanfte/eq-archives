If you do indeed roleplay, then I doubt you would have sent me a /tell
from halfway across the zone asking for a clarity in the first place.

If you noticed me strolling by, recognized my profession, and asked
for clarity in a roleplaying context, I would roleplay right back
atcha.



I consider the fact that the /roleplay tag makes you anonymous by
default a failing of the game engine.  But that, as they say in
Cathmandu, is a whole nother ball of wax.
