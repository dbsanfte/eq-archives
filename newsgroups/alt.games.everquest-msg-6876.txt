Actually, Dan Harmon is an educated poster who tries his best to
help people out here, while "Avenger" is a troller who stopped getting
replies via his previous tactic of acting like a twelve year old, so
now he's trying out acting like a six year old.

And since you have chosen to take his side despite his clear over-the-top
insults, personal attacks, and anti-social behavior, don't expect
any help from me, either.

Be sure to let me know which server you're playing on, so I'll know
which one has yet another immature brat on it and can steer clear.
