OK if you don't want to do that try Highkeep.  You could still make a level
or two on the Orcs in Highkeep and it's very good exp. or move into Highhold
Keep and try the Goblins in the basement.  They are good exp up until about
level 34.  These rooms used to be heavily camped, but with new Luclin zones
I'm not sure.  You can also try South Karana.  Before I got Luclin I
levelled my first character from 20-30 in these two zones.
