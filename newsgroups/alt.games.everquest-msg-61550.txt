Well, theres a DE camp in a house a little south of the entrance to HHP.
Havent tried to take my level 48 druid over there, but at level 35 i was 
happilly hunting a bear in Kith, and accidentially came within aggro 
range of that house. Lest just say i died in 1 nuke and didnt even see 
the house or what killed me, before i came back on my corpse run.

The will probably be able to take a level 52 wizzie down pretty fast. 
Anyone volunteer to go over to them and see how much they nuke for?
