I've started a Iksar Shammie, and I'm wondering after I think leveling to
eight or so to get Meditate that my Iksar would hit the cool Cruel world of
building factions with other races.
Where is the best place to take a Iksar Shammie to group with others and
build faction quickly?  Preferably near a Shammie guild which is willing to
train a wayward Iksar, would be ideal.  Everyone's 2cp is welcomed, thanks.
One more question too how many kills does it usually take to build faction
up a level with the Guards and Vendors of town, so that you can buy and sell
and enter the city?
