Yeah, if even that. The crystal caverns belt which has like 3 wis on
it and later that halloween belt (which you could jump in and get
fairly fast in qeynos hills if you knew how) devalued it a lot. Oh,
and if you have an HS key that belt is 6 wis and quite nice (course
you'd be higher level having an hs key)

I do remember before kunark and before velious that a druid on my
server who had just got the belt from fear, in addition to some other
verm, ported into butcher and auctioned the reed one (think thats the
one from bilge) for a flat price of 2 k plat. It sold in about 2
seconds. I just wished I'd had 2 k plat on me. That price was unheard
of then since this was the only wis belt for a druid or some other
classes except for the planes one.
