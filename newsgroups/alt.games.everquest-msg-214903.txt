No, legally binding means that the terms are upheld by law. Yes, all
the terms have to be allowable by law to be legally binding, but
that's only part of the meaning of the term.

Naturally. However, that doesn't mean jack about whether or not it's
illegal. Civil *****LAW*****.

Actually, it does. The allowing the other party to seek reparations is
the consequences of breaking the law. Civil law is still law, it's
just that the option to enforce it is totally within the hands of the
civilians rather than the government.
