Heh, it could be worse, start a Ranger in Qeynos Hills, zone out into the
"newbie" area and wander just east of the bind point. Several bigger undead
spawn there, and they camp your corpse. Or kill a wolf when that cute girl
in leather armour is standing nearby. Or chase a bat past that grizzly with
the funny white foam around it's mouth. Even in Surefall Glade, stroll
around the walls looking for an exit, if you are lucky you find the way out,
if not you find a secret wall. Behind the wall, an NPC, looks like one of
the nice guild masters... Wander over and hail the poacher... The Qeynos
area actually seems to be one of the safer newbie zones I have poked around
in. Except when the Loathesome individuals were spawning there...
