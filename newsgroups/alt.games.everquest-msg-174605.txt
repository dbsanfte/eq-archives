Howdy all, just another "where to hunt" type of question.

My time is pretty limited so I'm reduced to pickup groups for the most part
unless I plan something with friends quite a few days in advance.  I've been
in KC (of course) for a bit, but don't want to spend up to 60 there.  My
main is a 52 bard and I'm looking for another decent zone that tends to have
pickup groups like KC does.  I don't mind KC at all, but it's easy to find
horrible groups (I'm sure that comes with the pickup group atmosphere, but
beggars can't be choosers), and I don't want to get totally sick of the
place either.
Any advice is appreciated.

TIA,
Sean...
