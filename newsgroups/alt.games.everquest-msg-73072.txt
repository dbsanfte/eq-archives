There was a neverending event down in RM, and it was a wonderful place for a
cleric to make $.
The event in EK was up more often than not.
There were also events in WC, nro but they always seemed to end shortly
after i arrived.
Some event also going on in QH, but i have no clue about that one.

The good drops were in RM and EK.
