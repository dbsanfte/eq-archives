Absolutely.

God, could you imagine a druid who said in the Nexus, ok lets form a group
to hunt in Sebilis.    Then announces that every member of the group has to
pay him 25 pp for an evac to EJ, otherwise they better get running and hope
that they're still needed when they finally make it over there....

The correct response to said druid would be something along the lines of
"fuck off and die."

He can if he uses an essence emerald.   If you're willing to replace the
essence emerald he used, then yes.

I can make any rules I want, kid.  You're right that you dont' have to
follow them, but considering that I feel them reasonable, if you don't
follow them, you're not going to get a group with me.
