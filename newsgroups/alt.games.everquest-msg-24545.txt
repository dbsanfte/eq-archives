Hi, Just a couple of questions.

I'm a level 15 Half Elf Ranger, Master Baker (I said BAKER) and almost a
master Fletcher.  I've been wearing raw-hide armor mostly but have had a
couple of upgrades I either bought or were given to me by high level
players.  It's pretty neat how I got most of the freebies.  I'll be fighting
something toe-to-toe and be down to almost no health when I finally kill the
whatever.  Turn around and someone is standing there. Nice fight, have a
chain mail tunic. hehe I like to think that if it had been going worse they
would have healed me instead of giving me a cloak.  But the cloak is very
appreciated.

Anyway, on to the questions.  I have a gorget that's AC3 STR +3.  I also
have a banded gorget that I think is AC6 (might be 5).  Which should I wear?
Or should I switch depending on situation?  I also have a CHA +5 necklace
that I got in a quest.  I get much better prices selling and buying so I
wear it at vendors.

I lucked into a good buy in Erud for a weapon.  I bought a frozen longsword
for 21pp (completely bankrupted me).  Travelled a few zones away and sold it
for 50pp.   Went back and bought another one.  It's pretty quick and does
decent damage.  Should I really start looking for a higher damage weapon or
is it still good for my level?  What should I use in second hand at 17?  I
have a 1hb (which I have some skills in) in the bank along with a Giant
Snake Fang (which I have no skills in).  Or should I stick with 1hs in both
hands?  Just info, 1hs is maxed, 1hb is about 35, 2hb is about 20.  2hs and
piercing are 0.

And then the eternal question:  Where should I fight?  I HATE dungeons!
Blackburrow sucks.  It would be alright except for the twinkies who get
whacked once and run away screaming for a heal.  Here comes the train.  I
have fought a lot in West Karana.  I've been thinking about travelling to
Freeport and getting a bind there.  Then fight in the commons but they might
be just like the Karanas.  I just don't know.  I've talked to travellers and
I'm either 2 levels too high or 2 levels too low for most zones.

Thanks,
