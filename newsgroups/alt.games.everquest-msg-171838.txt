My guild cannot be denied the opportunity by the rules imposed by the guilds
currently in the rotation.  The alliance can.  Those are the rules that were
agreed upon a long time ago by the few guilds that were capable of taking
down the mobs in question, and they are still the rules that they impose.
Certainly, we could just go in, and try to take the mob before someone on
the rotation, and then suffer the consequent issues of destroying the
rotation.  So far, we have decided it is not worth it.
