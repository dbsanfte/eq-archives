A couple things.

The begging "problem" doesn't appear to be any worse than it was over a year
ago.  There was slime back then, there's slime now.

Secondly, and where I begin rambling, here's my rules for helping/not
helping newbies.

Make it a personal policy to NEVER EVER give ANYTHING to a newbie who asks
for it.  This includes, but is not limited to, money, items, buffs, or
saving their sorry ass if you're at a druid ring, wizard spires, or the EC
tunnel.

If a newbie asks me for sow or clarity I almost always "miss" their request.
If they ask for anything better I ALWAYS "miss" their request.

If a newbie sits down in front of me I treat them as I do a dog at the
dinner table...they're totally ignored.

IGNORE /YELLs unless there's no way for the person asking you to save their
lives had no idea you would be there (in other words, ignore /yells at a
druid ring).  If you decide to save their lives, MAKE SURE YOU ATTEMPT TO
KILLSTEAL.  Saving their life should come at a price.

Now, before you think I'm totally heartless, if you wander through a newbie
area and an orc pawn is about to kill a naked newbie, feel free to help the
newbie get the kill, as long as they didn't ask for help (don't cast damage
shield on a level 1-3 or they'll never get xp :-p ).

DO DRIVE-BY BUFFINGS

If you're of the mind to hang out in a newbie area and see who's deserving,
feel free to give fine steel or velious to folks you think deserve it.
Those who I've done a drive-by sowing who come back and request another one
get nothing else from me.

I have a 51 enchanter and 49 druid on Zeb.  I've just recreated my enchanter
(now level 8) back on The Rathe (where I was before the split).  He started
out with zero.  From level 1 - 7 I received 2 drive-by sows and a few level
29 drive-by shammie buffs.  I have not yet received even one material gift
from a stranger.  My begging so far has consisted of:

"Excuse me, I'd hate to ninja loot you if you intend to loot those
critters...so are you? =)" said to a level 46 ranger waiting for some epic
spawn in Gfay after she killed a pawn and cent.  Her response was "lol np,
go for it."   My other was in EC on my way to HH to get my spells...after
taking the boat from BB to FP...back to BB (was looking the wrong way on the
boat...grrrr) back to FP.   I said "Excuse me %t (her name was hard to
type), I don't mean to bother you but I'm running to HH to get my level 8
spells...would you mind sowing me?  If not, that's ok, I'll just be more
careful running. =)"
