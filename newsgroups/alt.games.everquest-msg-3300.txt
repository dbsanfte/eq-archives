I agree if someone says make an offer I reply you just lost a sale I always
include a price and stats in my auctions and for those who say the box is
not big enough there are 5 lines to a hot key, Or use the Shift arrow key.
Example of my latest auction "Golden Efreeti Boots 5ac 9int 9wis 9500p or
Trade for Monk Gear". and I always get some bozo that will ask to trade a
shroud of nature or ask how much. I politely relpy read the auction and
rebroadcast it. Most people like to know what you are asking, and it does
save time and the trouble of answering every tell "How Much". I do get the
people saying thats too much which I reply its a starting point make me an
offer.
