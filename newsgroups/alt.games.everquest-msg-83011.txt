LQ pelt and silk thread. Make silk thread by combineing two spiderling
silks in the tailoring kit.

www.eqtraders.com is an excellent resource.

I also make money by selling skinning knives for 5pp. I sell stacks of
bat wings and bone chips for a couple of PP. Make 10PP by selling silk
thread as well.

Of course I sell Jewelry all the time, being an Enchanter and a master
(100+) Jeweler.
