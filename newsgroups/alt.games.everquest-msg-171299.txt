Again, do your homework. A 65 SK with maxed POP aa's that boost HT does
7200, unresistable in PvE.  It takes 30 aa's to complete this series.  6 SKs
are more than enough for a Kunark dragon. 2 groups of SKs with this
skill could most likely do Sontalak, particularly if they had improved
damage
focus items.

Some better questions: why would any level 65 character possibly care about
gorenaire?  How many servers (other than pvp servers) will have a
significant
number of 65 sks, much less 65 sks with these particular AA's?
