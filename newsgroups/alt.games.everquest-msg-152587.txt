Be aware, that in some zones (i.e. Hollowshade Moor, Runnyeye)
You cannot stop this forward movement by doing the twist in certain
areas.   Runnyeye has a few areas that seem to be frictionless and
when you turn you still move in the original direction.   
Hollowshade Moore has some weird Physics.  if your runnign along and
on a slight to great slope and attempt to stop you keep moving, sora
like at 0 gravity.  Rather funny when trying to catch a running foe,
and he moves in a different direction and you attempt to but keep
moving the original way.
