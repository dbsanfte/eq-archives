Moved my troll warrior to HPH to group in orc parties, working on
faction to eventaully get into the keep for lookout, guard, and warrior
rooms groups, not to mention convenient banking, shopping, etc. plus the
chance to improve Qeynos and Freeport factions.  Collecting Orc Scalps
to give to Capt. Ashlan and some guild friends have been dropping off
some Gnoll scalps for Capt. Orben as well.  But reading up on these
quests, I keep seeing people say "be sure you're invisible when you turn
them in."
  There's not always somebody in the group with invis so I can't be sure
I'll be able to get an invis when I'm ready to turn them in. Do you
*have* to be invis to do these two quests if you're a troll?  Can't I
kill enough orcs in the normal course of grouping to turn them in?
  Secondly, I know it's going to be a lot, but after three solid playing
sessions of a few hours, I've probably killed (or at least got the
faction hit for by "helping") in the range of one to two hundred orcs.
Last I checked, the Volunteer who hangs out near the Kithcorre end of
Highpass was still KOS to me.  Roughly how many orcs am I going to have
to whack before I start seeing some progress? And will I have to be
indifferent to Orben and Ashaln for the scalp quests, or will dubious
do?
TIA.
