Wanna join my guild when I transfer mine? I'm still working out, though,
how to cross over my maxxed out 1 Hand Slash skill to 1 Hand Slice With
a Cauterizing Focused Beam of Light Energy skill. Oh, and I'll need to
transfer all my quest armor in exchange for something with mirrors on
it.

Free EB earring with each transfer. Hole in the side of our Millenium
Falcon? No worries, mate! We dont' need to Breathe!!!!!
