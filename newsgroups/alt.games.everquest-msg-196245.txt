You miss my point.  Yes I had KEI, but I wasn't casting many spells, the Breeze
actually kept me going almost as well, Clarity would have been more mana flow
than I was using.

POTG is a better buff for me, even soloing, than KEI, or at least was up to 24,
now I'm actually capable of putting a dent in my mana by stacking slow and four
DOTs on each mob I pull.  With KEI, its all back before next pull, I haven't
tried this with POTG yet.

While I enjoy leveling up fast, and soloing, and partnering, this doesn't stop
me from joining groups.  Groups can slow down exp flow, but they present their
own challenges and there's a lot more interaction to them.  Nice thing to me
about a soloing class is that I -can- happily play without a group, and yet
nothing prevents me from partnering or forming a group of any given size.  I've
played classes that have a hard time soloing (rogue, cleric) and ones that have
a hard time finding a group (necro, warrior, druid) and I'm definately finding
shaman a more enjoyable class because he's desirable in groups yet can solo
with ease.  (speaking of "with ease" shaman also beats bard thus far, a much
better solo class but WORK)
