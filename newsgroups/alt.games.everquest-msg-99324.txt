The high level version moves you TO the safe spot.  The lower level
one moves you NEAR the safe spot.  That's a major difference in
places like Siren's Grotto.

It encourages players to move into dungeons earlier.  Presumably,
if your group is getting wasted deep, you can move the group to a
spot closer to the entrance that's likely to have lower-level mobs.
Then you just work your way back down.
