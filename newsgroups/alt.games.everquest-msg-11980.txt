At very very high level, it's warrior, cleric, rogue, monk as the truly
desired classes, with ranger and wizard useful, but not really needed,
and everyone else is in the "well, we aren't going to be assholes and
keep you out of guild events just because the current high end game
makes your class useless" category.

By "very very high level", I mean the kind of things where you are
fighting things that on some servers have never been killed (or in some
cases, never even tried).

If the Luclin expansion is anything like that previous two expansions,
the list of desired classes at the high end change again.

Good advice.  Look around at the top guilds (FoH, Afterlife, LoS, etc.)
and you'll see that they do have members of all classes, *but* they
aren't taking new members of some classes.  The best way to ensure that
your character will be welcome at higher levels is to have many old
friends among your fellow high level players.
