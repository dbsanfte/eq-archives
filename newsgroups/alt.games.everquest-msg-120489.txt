Nor do I. However, that is not what we are talking about. We are
talking about people who intentionally pay far less than they know it
is worth. Doing so *is* taking advantage of people.

Nope. What will happen is the pre-pay policy will become the norm.
People will pay the going rate, because it's worth it. Incidently,
maybe it's different on different servers, but the "common knowledge"
norm is 15pp to 25pp minimum - more if porting to certain destinations
as I understand it.

Now who is being hypersensitive? I've addressed (a difference of
opinion is not an attack in my book) your point. I took only mild
offense to the tone of your own replies and responded in a manner far
more civil than many others here may have. Don't resort to nitpicking
my comments to try to discredit me because of the conclusions I draw
which paint you in an unpleasant light. Everything I've said has been
logically deduced from your own comments.

Uh huh. Sure. That's like saying, "The chick deserved to be raped.
Look at the way she was dressed." Or, "They deserved to have their
bicycle stolen. They left it unchained in their front yard." It's a
stupid line of reasoning. Do I have sympathy for the victim (porter)?
Yes. Do I think they could have avoided the problem? Of course. Does
that make the act of intentionally taking advantage of them
acceptible? *Hell no*!

To be sure. I don't dispute that. I was not being sarcastic when I
said it was impressive. I consider it an accomplishment to have a
character of that high a level and I aspire to be that uber myself
someday. It just doesn't make you more qualified to determine whether
or not the act of intentionally underpaying for a good or service is
ethical. After all, that is the point I have been trying to make.
