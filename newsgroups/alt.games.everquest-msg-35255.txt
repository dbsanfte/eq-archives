Actually, I don't think any Half elf bards are Gay (in any sense of the
word) it's just a generalisation I make in game as a joke (I also play a
half elf bard as an alt, he's really a mule but is 22nd level)
I do this generally in character and most players see the funny side (anyone
who's played a bard and seen the anim for wind or brass instruments will see
my point) and play a long, I often get replies back like "I am NOT gay and
if you say I am again I am going to tell my Boyfriend!"

My personal opinion of bards is pretty high, all the ones I have ever
grouped with have been a real asset to the group and always missed when they
leave.

So no, I don't think Half Elf Bards are all Gay. Human ones tho' Definite
Village People complex going on there ;ï¿½)
