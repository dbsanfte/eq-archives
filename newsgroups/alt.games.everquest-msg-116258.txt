Our guild had a guild war with one of our allied guilds once, just for fun.
1 hour only, only in Oasis, so noone who didnt want to have fun would 
get hurt.

Round one was kinda boring, since we were 28 and they were 7, so they 
went down fast.

Then some of our members defected over to Da Troll Patrol to even the 
odds, and we had great fun, we let the guild war go on 2 extra hours, 
since it was so fun.
