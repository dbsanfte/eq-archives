I concur with this 100%.

Don't forget to Hide, might get a better price for them.

Sewing kits, toolboxes, any container that holds giant size items. Look 
for a mage to summon you some bags, 100% weight reduction on these tusks 
is a godsend, just be sure to sell them off before you camp...

> Then just snare, fear dot, and beat on them. 
Watch the pathing on your first couple, make sure you know which way they 
will run when they run. Getting an extra mammoth or two beating on you 
for scaring their friend does not make for a pleasent evening.

There are a couple of places safe to med at around where the mammoths 
roam, the most common being the ruins. I usually went treeform to med, 
kept me safe enough when those darn skellies weren't wandering about.

I made a little more money and about the same exp. About 11 real time 
hours garnered me 2 1/2 levels and around 650-700 pp.
