I have yet to see a mob die to a ranger's innate camo.  The only way you
advance in this game is by killing things.

It's neat.  It's cool.  It's useful.  It's never gonna kill a mob.

Add to that, you *already* have invis.  Unless you are trying "trick" pulls,
instant invis isn't all that important.  And leave the "trick" pulls to
bards/SKs anyway, they have the rest of the tools.
