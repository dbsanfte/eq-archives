Yes it should, as it is basically a buff that only lasts 10secs.
I can remember when haste Items used to stack, making a mith and an fbss the
combo to have (making it around a 21/25 weapon) they nerfed this, can't
think why :ï¿½)
I believe it's now one haste effect (mith, FBSS etc) one spell buff (like
celery) + a bard song can stack and that's all. The Exe Axe proc would count
as the buff.
I did hear people saying that one of the newer items did actually stack with
another (RBG?) but this was being argued about not agreed with.

Max haste you can have is 100%
lowest, effective, delay of any weapon is 10.
