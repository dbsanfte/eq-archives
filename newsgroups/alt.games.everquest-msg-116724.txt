Ok, that sounds fair.

That leads to a related question.  Who do you say has done the most for the
raid?  Is it the guy who shows up for every raid, even though he's not an
"essential" class?  Or is it the sometimes main tank?  I've actually heard
people say that the latter is the case, since the Main Tank is the one that
takes all the damage, he does the most for the guild.  Sure, but how about
the rogue who dishes the damage out?  Or the Cleric who keeps the MT on life
support?  It's not like the player's taking the hits, he just goes in there,
hit's attack, and taunts.  Meanwhile, you've got the spare tanks (and their
groups) running from add to add to keep the raid from going south, but they
aren't "deserving."  Not saying you take this view, only that I've heard it
before.

The question is, are the stars more deserving than the supporting cast?

Of course, that also could lead to problems, or it could lead to culling out
those who don't keep the guild's interests in mind.  Probably depends on the
guild leader.

How is this usualy viewed by larger guilds?  I'm trying to save for a Sword
of the Morning.  I've outgrown my Ro breasplate, so I want to sell it to
help my sword fund.  Or, am I obligated to pass it down to the next
generation?  Where is the line drawn?  Do you pass down things you get in
guild raids?  Or things you replace in guild raids?  If I sell things I got
in guild raids so that I can get an even more uber item, am I not still
helping the guild (assuming I raid with them regularly)?  Or, am I expected
to fund my sword only on dropped plat and vendor loot?  Something I've never
had to deal with, so I'm not sure.

Possibly.... but given the number of uber guilds that require 50+ or
55+.....  Let's just say I doubt that every member of these guilds was
unguilded until they joined.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
