Well there is no monk vahshir.

Beastlord with a warrior would catastrophically suck ;)

The beastlord is a neutered shaman who does not even get good heals
(at least from people parsing the spell info) for itself or other
players. Instead it gets probably the best pet in the game since it
gets a buff to raise its level and power every few levels. The
beastlord gets cleric style heal spells but ONLY for the pet. In fact
its healing of its pet is probably better than a clerics heal at the
same level. It gets the celestial type, complete, etc but only for its
pet. I think its highest regular healing is the 90 hp "heal." 

The beastlord is also probably on the priest melee table I'd wager and
does not even get dual wield though it supposedly has a gimmick where
it can fight hand to hand. The reason I say that is that with such a
buff pet that it can complete and other heals, it won't also have good
melee itself or it would be outrageously overbalanced. Maybe it will
have some new melee place just barely above the priest tables and
possibly get dual wield, but you can bet its melee will suck.

Of course we won't know for sure until the day Luclin is out and the
info is plastered on every web site.

So I'd say go with a warrior and shaman beastlord. Yeah its nothing
new or fancy but it works. With the Warrior beastlord you'd have a
warrior probably getting more aggro than the pet and a beastlord who
could not heal the warrior while with the shaman you have ok heals and
quicken/slows etc.
