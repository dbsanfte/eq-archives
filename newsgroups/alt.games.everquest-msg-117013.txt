Well, I've never made it to 45, but feel the same way as you.

I've played EQ on and off since the beginning.
My favorite levels are 20-35...after that I burn out, take a break-
and start a new character when I get back.

I tried to get back into single player RPG's...but they just don't do
it for me anymore.  I was hyped for Morrowind- played it a few days
and then shelved it.

I currently have a Luclin character.  Instead of powerleveling or
twinking...I'm just going around exploring and doing the in game
quests.  I level slower- but heck, I'm having more fun than I've had
in a while.  Anything to avoid groups and chain pulling...blah- that
made the game boring for me.
