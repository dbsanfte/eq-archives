I didn't choose anything. Read the quote again. What part "...ability to set
'max FPS' but to set 'max background FPS'." do you not get?

FYI anything that runs on the background doesn't have focus. Only the active
window has focus. How this affects 2-boxing with a program like WinEQ I
don't know, but then again that wasn't the subject here.

Indeed, nothing bad but he's just confused, eh? Or maybe you are?

If interpreting something exactly as it's written doesn't constitute logic,
according to your logic, then your logic is seriously illogical.

You'd better stop now, you're only digging yourself a deeper hole each time
you reply.
