No, blaming it on routers. Routers crash now and then, or get flooded,
or any number of things. This will only effect connecting to something
that you have to go through that router to get to, but other things
will be just fine. Also why someone on the other side of the country
can connect to the same place without a problem. The ISP and the other
end aren't the problem, it's one of the middle men in these cases.

Really, you've been using the Internet how long now....?

Not saying router problems are causing the Bazaar crashing problem,
just clarifying something you obviously don't have an understanding
of.
