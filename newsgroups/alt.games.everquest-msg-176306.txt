God again led me to this chapter last night which I have never read =
before.=20

Matt.19
[1] And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he =
departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;

[2] And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

[3] The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, =
Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

[4] And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which =
made them at the beginning made them male and female,

[5] And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and =
shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?

[6] Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God =
hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

[7] They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of =
divorcement, and to put her away?

[8] He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts =
suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not =
so.

[9] And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be =
for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso =
marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.

[10] His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his =
wife, it is not good to marry.

[11] But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save =
they to whom it is given.

[12] For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's =
womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and =
there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of =
heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.

[13] Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should =
put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.

[14] But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to =
come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

Guess this means that children will always go to heaven, so if you were =
to have a child now it would probably go to heaven.

[15] And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

[16] And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good =
thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

[17] And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good =
but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the =
commandments.

[18] He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou =
shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear =
false witness,

[19] Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy =
neighbour as thyself.

[20] The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my =
youth up: what lack I yet?

[21] Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou =
hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and =
come and follow me.

[22] But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: =
for he had great possessions.

[23] Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a =
rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

[24] And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through =
the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of =
God.

[25] When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, =
Who then can be saved?

[26] But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is =
impossible; but with God all things are possible.

[27] Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken =
all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?

[28] And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have =
followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the =
throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the =
twelve tribes of Israel.

[29] And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, =
or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's =
sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.

[30] But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
