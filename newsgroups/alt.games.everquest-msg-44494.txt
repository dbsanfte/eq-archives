I just dinged 40 and I have about 500pp in the bank. I do have some nice
gear that I've bought/traded for. I don't have much useful advice, but I
thought it might help to know you're not the only po' monk out there.
 Best moneymaking I've had has been in Crystal Caverns. I'm kinda high for
there now, but I'm thinking of heading back to try and solo the geonids.
They drop some jewels that can be sold to vendors for 40-50pp+. Having a
bank right in the zone is a godsend for a monk as well.
 I'll be eagerly watching this thread to see what I can do to get the 7-8k
saved up to buy a FBSS.
