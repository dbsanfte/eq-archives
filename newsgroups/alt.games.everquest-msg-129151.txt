I have just listed armor class gear, as imo thats what druids should be
wearing, and using tactics of damage shield/dot/treeform (healing). Get your
defense trained now, cos when you get to 50 it will be very very hard to
train. Try and max it at level 40.
Having high defense wont help you against the mobs youll get getting xp from
at post 50, but it sure as hell will help when youre down a dungeon being
attacked by a group of agro greens.
