I have never parsed it, but I do use Spirit Quickening, along with all 
other hp and ac buffs for my pet when I solo.  It certainly stacks on the 
pet, but, I can't say for certain about the individual effects such as 
haste, I have never really checked.  I can't even say with certainty that 
it boosts his effectiveness, guess I really should find out.
