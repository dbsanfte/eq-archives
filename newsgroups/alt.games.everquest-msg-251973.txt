   Are you wrong about being bored?  Obviously not.  And CoH is much more
action/fighting based than EQ, though the missions are optional, that I can
tell.  But yes, you are wrong about it not being a MMORPG.  At lower
levels, few people chose to group, but that is true in EQ as well.  The
higher you go, the more grouping is likely to seem like a good idea.

   For what it's worth, I would agree that CoH is for the most part much
more shallow than EQ.  There are Task Missions that can take the better
part of a day I am given to understand, but basically what one does is log
in and jump into fighting right away.  For someone who is a causal gamer,
this can be much better.  For someone that has time for the intricacies of
EQ, this can be boring.  It really depends on the player.  Just because
they are both MMORPGs doesn't mean they will both appeal to the exact same
type of person for the exact same sort of reasons.
