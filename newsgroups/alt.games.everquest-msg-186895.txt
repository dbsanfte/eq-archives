No, everyone is nonKOS to start with in Shadowhaven and the Nexus.  You 
will need to sneak/hide past the higher level areas in paludal and get 
closer to one of the other zones.  Just con mobs as you go to know when you 
have hit the right area for your level.  As a DE rogue, I believe you also 
have a disadvantage in your physical stats that does not help your soloing.  
At level 13, you should be about as well off as most any other melee 
though, and should be able to solo mobs.  If you really want a largely 
soloing career, then a rogue is not the right choice though, regardless of 
race, unless you can get yourself outfitted in some serious gear, and even 
then, it's far from easy.
