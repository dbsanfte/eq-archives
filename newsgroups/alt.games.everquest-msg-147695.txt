As a 54 necro, are there any nifty spots to solo? I fully expect to be
laughed at if I go LFG, since of course "all necros must solo and never want
to group." And soloing is something I can do when my favorite wizzie or
guildies are not available (which is what I normally do- group with them!).
Most of my favorite spots have greened out or on the edge of greening, and I
was hoping to hear a few suggestions of where to go.

The only limits are:
1. It cannot be on Luclin. While I have this expansion, I can't hunt here
longer than 30 minutes without getting a migraine. I count Jagged Pine as
Luclin- it uses the same style of graphics and has the same effect on me.
2. It can't ruin faction with Freeport, Neriak, or Qeynos. Anything else is
up for grabs. If you know a sweet spot to camp guards, in any other town.
I'm willing.
3. I prefer root-rotting over fear-kiting if possible.

Any ideas?
