No idea what people do, really :) It's the same with all the spider
mobs in Firiona Vie: Keeping my eyes open I got through there 50
times unharmed with levels as low as 3.

For the boat: You arrive from Oasis. Get off the barge. To your right
is a big rock (not the small one in the middle of the beach where you arrive)
Follow that rock or even walk on it (i.e. rightwards when you arrive ..
southwards by compass). You'll see a few ogre houses and the ogre dock.
That's where the ship docks. Now I never had problems just walking onto
the dock, even visible, with some ogre nearby. Just stay off them as far as
possible. They don't walk around much (or not at all .. never
seen one doing so) and I never met any on the wooden dock. One day
I was too scared (well .. my early days), and sat on the rock till
the boat came. When it came, I just swam to it and mounted it
by one of the slanted barrels on its sides (only works there from
water).
