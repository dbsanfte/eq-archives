I'm level 17 brawler, and I did the run from freeport to qeynos as a test
with a level 30 guy, and we found something odd. Grey mobs still attacked
us. eg level 22 mobs.

Also it was a lot tougher than the last time he did the run and the old
guides seem to have been invalidated by a patch. There was a lot more aggro
mobs in nek, although the run through TS was ok (got stunned but survived).

I'm thinking about how I can do the run solo, and it seems unlikely. My FD
will be ignored, and there's lots of roaming aggro groups. I was thinking a
totem of the wolf might help with running although i presume the illusion is
just a special effect and doesn't actually help? They really seem to have
made the run hard for anyone not grouped. A shame, that's one type of quest
that I think should be soloable for all classes.
