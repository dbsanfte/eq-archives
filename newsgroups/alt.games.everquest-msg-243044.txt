1) If you give it just a bit more time, this will be corrected. This is
*not* the norm. If you're just too impatient for that, then I can't help
you. 

2) Have you never before bought a dud of a PC game? It happens. I'm not
saying it's happened here. I think you're completely wrong in your
opinion in that regard, but if you are confident in your conclusion
despite the input of many who have played for years, then just chalk it
up as another dud and move on. Sure, it sucks, but it happens. You just
paid $10 more for this "dud" than you typically had on others.
