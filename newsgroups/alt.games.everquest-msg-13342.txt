My thought would be that he saw wounded Griff walking(not running from
zone) assumed(wrongly) that It had chased someone to zone or killed
recently.  Root is faster than a nuke, and therefore a quicker
engagement.  That would have been my assumption.  As soon as I saw root
stick, back off... 

He was still wrong, but not quite as evil(perhaps) as it would appear at
first glance.
