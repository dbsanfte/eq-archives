Don't ignore your Defense skill either. For priest classes that's 
a lot more valuable than Offense or weapon skills in the long run.
At level 31 you've got a perfect opportunity to work on this: 
needlites in Echo Caverns. They'll still be dark blue to you but 
not by much (they're level 25-ish). Needlites hit VERY fast but 
rather low damage per hit making them perfect for Defense training.
