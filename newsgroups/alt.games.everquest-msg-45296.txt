>> The one possible issue is people sending "Farm Aid" characters loaded
down with farmed gear for sale/trade on the new server - but given that
every character transfer is SUPPOSED to be reviewed anyways, how tough could
it be to weed these out? <<

Two problems with this theory:

1) When a character is transferred from one server to another, he arrives
NAKED. No gear, no money, nothing but his level and skills.

2) Characters cannot be transferred to a new server. The server must be at
least 6 months old before transfers are allowed.
