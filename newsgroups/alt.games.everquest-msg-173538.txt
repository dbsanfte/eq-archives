My only major problem from best buy is when I bought a direcpc satellite
dish for my internet access.  The sales person insisted that I sign a years
contract for "DirecTV" to purchase the dish.  I explained that I would not
sign it as it was made for DirecTV not DirecPC.  He gave me all kinds of
grief with this and i kept insisting that he call for a manager which after
10 minutes of arguing, he finally did and was told that he was completely
wrong.  I dont know if he didnt really know any better or if he was trying
to loop me into a directv contract for a year, either way, negligence or
stupidity, I rarely shop there anymore if I can avoid them.
