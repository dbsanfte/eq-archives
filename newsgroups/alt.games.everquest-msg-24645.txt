Race STR STA AGI DEX WIS INT CHA Bonus Pts 
Dark Elf 60 65 90 75 83 109 70 30 
Erudite 60 70 70 70 83 117 80 30 
Gnome 60 70 85 85 67 108 70 30 
Human 75 75 75 75 75 85 85 30 
High Elf 65 65 85 70 95 102 90 30 

I'm making an enc for an alt, and I was wondering...how should I distribute my
points? I think that according to that, an erudite has the best stats for an
enc and a high elf second best (assuming you want to max cha and int). Do the
int items give more than the cha items or vice versa? If I make an erudite and
put all my points into int, that's 147 int and 80 starting cha. 120 cha seems
like a lot to fill in, while 53 int not that much. I just had a thought, I
think I can only put 25 points into int (making it 142 and my cha 85)...still
the same dilemma, it seems. Help anyone? Thanks!
