You should remember yourself that mmorpgs aren't things people like
waiting for, either, due to the draw of getting in on the ground floor
and perhaps getting ahead of the mass population curve. Those 'kids'
you are referring to are going to buy it when it comes out, not wait
to get it for christmas. And they certainly aren't going to be buying
a year subscription to it either.

I don't think you understand either current 'kids' or the monthly
subscription market very well. First of all, 'kids' aren't really a
very large proportion of the playerbase. Most the people playing are
college age or older. Secondly, those that are in it have no problems
managing the monthly fee, especially with Sony offering gamecards they
can buy on their own (and I imagine Blizzard will do the same
eventually).
