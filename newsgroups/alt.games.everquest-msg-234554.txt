What makes you say that? It is THEIR intellectual property, and some
profiting off of someone else's intellectual property despite being
expressly forbidden to do so in the terms of use tends to almost
always go in favor of the copyright holder... (See RIAA's case against
Napster)

So, please, provide some support for your legal opinion. Provide some
backing as to why the courts would ignore SOE'S FUCKING COPYRIGHT.
