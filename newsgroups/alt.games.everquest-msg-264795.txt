Could it be a tradeskill thing?  Are EQ2 tradeskills like SWG tradeskills,
in that traders might own huge amounts of items (e.g., whole dwellings full
of containers full of tradeskill items), and items you make and sell/give to
other players need to be tracked as having been made by you?  Because of the
tradeskill stuff, SWG probably required 10-100 times as much storage per
character as other MMORPGs (and this is rumored to be what was behind all
the database problems they had early in the game).

Anyway, supposedly one of the reasons they limited people to one character
per server in SWG was because characters were so big.
