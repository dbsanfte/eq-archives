Why?  Do you insist on changing the rules of every game you play?
If you sit down to a game of chess to you demand to be allowed to
move each of your pieces every turn?  Why shouldn't the "real limit"
be that as you cast a spell its gem is erased and you must rest 8
hours of game-time before you can remem it to cast again?

Why that's an excellent plan!  It's not as if casters weren't already
grotesquely overbalanced.  Hell, why not dispense with mana and spell
slots altogether?  We should be able to cast any spell we know as
often as we like!  I think it's a crime that there're any limits at
all on casters in EQ.  How can you possibly justify restricting their
melee skills?  What's to prevent a Mage from learning to use a two-
handed sword every bit as well as, if not better than, some moron of
a Warrior?  Why isn't my Enchanter just as deadly sticking a knife in
a mob's back as some thumb-sucking sneak-thief?  And what's with this
hit point bullshit anyway?
