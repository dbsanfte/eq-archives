Depends on what it is.  Gear and things that're dropped, I have no real
feelings on it, but basically as long as they're not doing it to gouge, I
have no problem with it.

If it's player-made goods that're being sold for a reasonable
price-over-cost, that are very high end for the skill, and the agreement is
in order to keep the market from being flooded by people who can afford to
lose the plat, then I actually agree with it quite a bit.  Nothing is quite
so frustrating as spending a bundle trying to raise a tradeskill a few
points only to find someone selling things for cost in the bazaar.

And that's just as a baker, where cost might be 50-100 plat a try (if you
bought parts instead of spending hours hunting them), imagine the
frustration for tailors and smiths who'll spend *thousands* on a skillup
attempt.  Maybe other people can afford to lose out on thousands of plat,
but they dampen or ruin advancement chances for those who can't.

(That's an issue that's been highly debated on eqtraders.com.)
