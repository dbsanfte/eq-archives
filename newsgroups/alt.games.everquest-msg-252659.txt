Hmmmm, I learned early how to escape mobs.  Even before I learned
the pseudo-exploit of strafe running I discovered jumping (which
is faster than strafing until your endurance runs out, way faster
depending on terrain and how you time your jumps).  I remember
winning a footrace at a guild event once and giving credit to my
"personal trainers", the Kodiaks of West Commons.  This was all
well before RoK was released (the "training" that is, the
footrace occurred after Luclin).  So, no, you did not _ever_ have
to die just because you were losing or outclassed.  If they've
made it slightly easier for lowbies to escape now, well that's
got to be damned near the least significant bit of dumbing-down
anybody's bothered to bitch about.  Surely you can do far better
than that.
