Yeah, I agree using mouse to click would be bad, though sometimes I do it
just to give my left hand a rest.  I find solo XP grinds are the worst, I
really wanted to get a few levels on my cat and blew through 46 - 50 in a
matter of play days.  Generally I would grind out a session of 5 hours
soloing like mad.

With one button every 3.3 seconds, over 5 hours that is still 5454 clicks
just in that little session.  I'm sure there are bards that grind for more
than 5 hours, but that is my limit before I go mental and wrist blows up.

I just took 10 days of from eq and it is amazing how much better my left
hand/wrist feel now :)
