Same box exactly.  The Egghead receipt says I bought it on 11/6/94 along
with Earthsiege....which I apparently returned because I was "dissatisfied"
with it (I later re-bought it at a show...it's in the closet).  Guess I was
"satisfied" with MOM.  Looks like I back-uped all the floppies as well as
copied in patches (used Winsplice to split them).  The packing material
includes a MicroProse Rufund Offer of $10 off  Master of Orion and
X-Com....which I apparently never took advantage of (already had them,
maybe?).  There's also an "order by mail" form for the Prima strategy
guide....which I also have, but not with the game.  I prefer the "gift-box"
packaging of Origin games of the period to these slipcover MP boxes.

I'm not going to dig for these.  The game piles are unstable and a mis-step
could bring the whole thing down on me.  I was lucky with MOM because it was
in one of the front stacks.  Hey!  Hang on to that unopened X-Com.  Money in
the bank, I tellz ya!

The WC games are on the shelf by my pc and are readily accessible.  I see
the deluxe edition of Wing Commander "includes Secret Missions 1 & 2," WC2
with separate speech pack and SO1/2 (all on 5.25 floppies, of course), WC3,
4 and WCP...all in those nice gift boxes (except for the packs).  And
there's WC Privateer with its speech pack and Righteous Fire, as well as the
CD version and a couple of deluxe versions (I REALLY liked Privateer).

Yeah, back in the day, I played XW and the expansions to death (also have
the originals and collectors ed).  I really liked TF because of the RPG
element (had to get those promotions in the "Order" as well as the regular
ranks....loved that tatoo that gradually became more elaborate).  Back in
those days, a guy named Keith Heitmann moderated a group of SWOTL/XW players
on the old Prodigy game boards.  This was before multi-player (hell, it was
before the web.  Downloading from PBBS's was the big deal in those halcyon
days of yore) so everybody would discuss SP tactics and produce mods by
hexing the game code.  Great fun!

Dark Legions, no; Merchant Prince, yes (it was precursor of Macchiavelli:
The Prince, IIRC).

I'm thinking of people collecting them to own the original games with
original documentation, etc.  They'd cost so much you couldn't afford to
risk slipping an original floppy in your precious, antique 5.25 drive (how
many peeps still have operable 5.25 drives?  I've only got one....in an old
386SX 20).  Anyway, if someone wants to play them, they'll just dl them from
Underdogs or have them on modern media of some kind.
