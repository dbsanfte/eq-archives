Funny , this has not been my experience at all. Those with multiple
characters stopped playing the monk for anything but special purpose pulling
. Some stopped playing all together. None think the nerf justified. Some
warriors , paladins , and sks liked the nerf but monks know better. Most
clerics and chanters will know better as well.

I would put the list as follows for combat dammage. Casters not included
rangers
rogues
monks
warriors
sks
paladins

There is a far greater diffrence between the top two and any of the lower 4.
Monks and warriors can come extremely close at the high end for dammage.
Best warrior weapons are 15 19 best monk 18 20. Warriors gain more extra
dammage from aa`s then monks can.
