Well, I know he can only be hit by magic weapons, but about a week ago I had
the Kelethin noob guards fighting the PoD (as a druid, charm a bat, yes
they're animals, and give it the /pet attack command with the PoD targeted,
but you standing next to the noob guards, the PoD will kill the bat, shout
about the power of discord, and rush at you before getting intercepted by 3
noob guards.)

PoD: 0  (even with at least 2 Cheals per fight)
Noob Guards: 3
