At least we don't look like we have a bucket on our heads!  Plate helms on
wood elves stick out their ears, on humans looks like a bucket, on dark
elves looks just plain ugly, on barbs has horns sticking out of it (same
with trolls), ogres....well....we won't go into that, on high elves looks
like a Spanish guard, of course Iksar can't wear plate, gnomes look like
Roman legionairres, (forget what halfling looks like), leaving Half Elves
and Erudites and Dwarves as the best looking plate helmets. :-)
