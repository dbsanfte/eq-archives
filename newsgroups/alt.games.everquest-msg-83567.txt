I never trust reviews, anyway. Impartial reviews don't seem to draw
readers, so you'll never see them. Just go look at Game Revolution's
reviews on the Final Fantasy series. The reviewer that has done every
one since 7 has a rather blatant bias against the genre in general or
is such an anal retentive perfectionist, nothing is bearable to him.
He even counts of major points for the games not having voice
actors...Perish the thought, forcing gamers to read!

Reviews are good for a summary of the highs and lows of the game (even
if the reviewer sees what you call a high to be a low), but never
trust the "score". Same rule goes for movies, I've found.
