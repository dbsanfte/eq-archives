Well, one of the people he mentions in his story, Madrone, is my
guildleader.  Madrone confirmed that he, too, thought this guy was full of
it, but watched with his own eyes as the guy insta-killed Sonty.  Not solo'd
Sonty; brought him from full-health to dead instantly.

So that part is true.  And if you could insta-kill any mob, I can easily see
that you could progress through Uqua.  Remember, he can also warp himself
wherever he wants to go.

I didn't see any of this myself, this is all hearsay.  But it is credible
hearsay, which is why I repeated it.

He says he's left his tool in the hands of someone he trusts to carry on his
legacy.  What that means exactly remains to be seen.  =/
