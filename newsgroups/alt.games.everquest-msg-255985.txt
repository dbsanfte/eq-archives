Well, if you root a mob in the general area where someone is chain 
killing HG's with a pet, don't do any damage to it, and lie doggo nearby 
with a GM watching, you can hope he'll send pet at it without first 
assisting it to see if it has someone on the target list.

He won't have any idea he's KSing, but technically you've engaged first 
so he is.

In RM where mobs are all engaged on sight because you've got tons of 
competition, its hardly surprising if someone doesn't go thru the 
trouble of assisting the mob to make sure... if they even know such a 
technique is a possibility.

Not sure this is what the OP was talking about, mind you, just trying to 
make a case for such a frame up being possible.
