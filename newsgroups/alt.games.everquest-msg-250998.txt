And they don't count why?

More importantly kids smoke cigarrettes and drink alcohol first, before 
trying other drugs. Why is that? Because they are legal. By making them 
legal society says they are ok... sure they aren't 'good for you', wink 
wink... but then nothing fun is, nudge nudge.

The taxes aren't high enough to make it a big deal.

What right?

The right to minimize health care, social assistance, and rehab costs. 
The right of society not to accept the burder of your decision to turn 
yourself from a productive working tax paying citizen into an 
unemployable paranoid schiz with short term memory loss, attention span 
issues, and chemical dependancy problems.

Selling crack at walmart isn't good for society. So society has a right 
to ban it. Freedom to self medicate stops where it negatively impacts on 
those around you.
