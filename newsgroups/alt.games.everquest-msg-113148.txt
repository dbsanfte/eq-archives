Wizards are comparitively the strongest they have ever been. They suffer
from a low dammage over time problem. At least now with new spells and
manaburn they no longer get outdammaged in the SHORT term by rogues. I like
the idea of a battelship class just fine and think wizards are mostly fixed.
They certainly are far far better off than druids for instance.

Warriors are not in aoe groups . If you want a puller clerics are preferred
overall for their excellant divine aura lines, self healing, and backup aoe
dammage with upheavel. Paladins are almost acceptable as are necros and
perhaps bards(since they can do everything even though none of them know
how).

Casters where balanced against melee pre kunark just fine. Even then the
writing was on the wall that melee was going to be the way to go for any big
encounter. Slow steady dammage over time will always win against the big
bangs of casters. Melee always thought the grass was greener and that they
got shafted. They where always wrong then and now its just ridiculous. I
have played 3 characters up from scratch. The monk was by far the easiest,
the chanter was fairly simple , and the druid was a pain in the ass.

Dammage over time for a group is the only important stat if you are trying
to maximize experience over time which accounts to what most everyone is
doing most of the time.
