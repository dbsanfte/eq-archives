To test out something I'm seeing on a couple boards, the following
question to help with the troubleshooting:

Has anyone logged in *twice* on the same machine successfully?

I'm not talking about two boxers who logged in after the patch and are
still playing on one and checking boards on the other. Has anyone here
downloaded everything on one machine, logged all the way in to a
character, logged all the way off to desktop (for whatever reason) and
logged back in to play again?

Seems to be a pattern I'm seeing a lot.

Both our machines logged in once to play. Neither can log in now.
