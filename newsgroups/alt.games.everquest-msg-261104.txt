I thought i had 9.0b installed, and to the best of my memory, xp starts off
with version 8, so i thought i'd bite the bullet and try directx9.0c, adn
rerun dxdiag.

So I think you might have spotted it, but i'll have to try it out (cringe)
and hope i can undo the advanced options again if they cause the same
behaviour. I'll be impressed if code can actually cause the pc to turn off
like that. I would have thought that some virus writer would have used that
as a payload. Actually, don't read that last sentence, it might give you
ideas. :*)

Thanks for your help.
