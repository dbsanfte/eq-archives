Well, possibly more ram, a new processor, video card, maybe a new OS,
perhaps an additional hard drive... recently a lot of people have had to buy
these things in order to play eq :)

If you're talking strictly about software, you can buy an eq set that has
the main game and the first two expansions.  See if you like it, and then
try out the sol expansion.  (the first expansion was called ruins of karnuk
or something, the second one was the scars of valious or something).
