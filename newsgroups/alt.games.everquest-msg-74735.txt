I found that almost all the guilds / people were disorganized, and alot of
newbies (myself to some extent).  The guilds could be strong enough to start
organizing people properly to really start racking up the PvP, if they would
encounter a good sized force.  I also didn't like the idea that you could
sit around twiddling your thumbs in the border lands, because there no one
from opposing sides bothered to want to fight.  You could waste like hours
and hours while not getting 1) exp or 2) realm points.  Also if you wanted
to organize people to go, no one would want to.

It also seemed like the beta testers had an unfair advantage over the other
PvPers.

Really never even knew about the /friend channel.  played with the /Osend
channel (officer guild channel).  don't think they have an officer channel
for guilds in EQ, right?
If I had a friend, I would Do direct /sends for DAOC.  found myself trying
to type /sends for /tell in EQ when I started switching back  : (

Finally, I gave it up at level 22.  I decided it also wasn't worth the
trouble.  Was interesting for the money / time spent to learn about it.  The
siege mods would make it more interesting.
