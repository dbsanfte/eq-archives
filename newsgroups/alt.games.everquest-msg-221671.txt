What is the definition of a "camp" these days?  When I first started
playing EQ nearly 3 years ago the two areas you were "camping" used to
be two separate camps that two separate groups would claim.  I pulled
and swarmed kited (with success) nearly the entire mansion one morning
because I was bored.  Would it be OK if I were to declare the entire
mansion camped just because I could do it?

You left the camp, so then it became open for anyone to claim. 
Granted, it wasn't very nice of them the way they reacted toward you.

That is definitely wrong and should have been reported.

First: Petition & Report

Second: If you left the camp, then they aren't your kills.  That's the
way it goes when there is fierce competition for any camp.  There used
to be a line of people waiting to the get the Goblin camp at
Butcherblock or that female dwarf that everyone kills in Butcherblock

> lvl 39 ranger Drinal  server

At level 39 there are much better places than Unrest.
