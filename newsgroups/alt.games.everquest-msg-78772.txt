I have found this to be a very informative thread. Often not enough
emphasis is placed on group tactics such as these.

I would really like to find a more in-depth look into grouping, both
class specific and non-class specific.  If anyone could post and
useful links in that regard, I would appreciate it.

FYI, I already frequent Allakhazam.com, CastersRealm.com and
EverLore.com.
