I have fond memories of Blackburrow.  Just remember not to rest near the zone
and when someone says "train" run.  Right then.  Or get out of the way of the
pathing, (you CAN do this...)
That said, I never had to buy arrows because some of the gnolls there drop bows
and arrows.  
As far as training points go:  If you don't know the area I would suggest
putting a couple extra points in "sense heading".  
Save the rest of them for level 9, when you get spells.  You will be glad you
have those points to put into conjuration, etc.
