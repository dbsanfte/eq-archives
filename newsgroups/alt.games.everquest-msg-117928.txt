Sorry, but I have to say you're mistaken, and I'm speaking from direct
experience of the (numerous) times I've died in the last few weeks.

At level 60, I lose slightly more than a yellow bubble of XP when I
die.  After a 96% rez, I'm about 1 or 2 blue pixels down.  I took a 93%
necro rez last week, and *that* left me about 2/3 a blue down.

Do the math like Jeremiah suggested: if you were losing 2/3 blue
*after* a 96% rez, an unrezzed death would be costing you around 50/3
blue bubbles, i.e. 16-17 blues.  It doesn't.
