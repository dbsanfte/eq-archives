Yeah, but in reality, we're much more flexible.  Generally when RL
intrudes and folks can't raid enough, they ask to be taken out of
active status and free up a slot for whatever class they are.  They
still show up when they can, still have rights to drops, and often end
up getting some really nice guild gifts just to let them know we miss
them.  I can't think of a single example of a person being asked to
leave because of not enough gametime.  I can think of at least half a
dozen off the top of my head where they were asked to leave because of
whining or lootgreed.  Actually, the most recent person who left was
asked to leave because he was whining about others in the guild not
putting in enough hours.  Constantly.  Even though it's summer and RL
requires a fair bit of time away from EQ.  
I think the reason they seem so harsh is that it's expected.  If
you're going to be taken seriously as a higher-level guild, and not
have other guilds pulling ToV mobs onto your party, you have to have a
rather harsh front.  Given that the average age of our guild is
probably closer to 35 rather than 25, we're ok with a little
hypocracy.

You're right on this.  I think I'll bring it up with the guildleader
when he's drunk this weekend.  Active players generally remain active
players.  Of course losing folks to twinks can be more of a problem,
especially if they expect the guild to equip their twinks.

We did have this rule, and we really do feel this way, but we found we
couldn't enforce it without being real pricks.  It is rather upsetting
to get a PoG or Cobalt breastplate for a warrior and have him leave
the next week.  It's not such a big deal if everyone has nice gear,
but when you award a cobalt breastplate to a warrior and then see him
wearing another guild tag two days later, it leaves a bad taste in
your mouth.  Especially when other players passed on the item because
it wasn't as big an upgrade for them.  
The real reason for these type of rules is for the quest armor.  It
takes quite a long time to get enough gems and drops to outfit a guild
in Kael/SS/Thurg quest armor, especially before they upped the drop on
plate-class items.  If you're working on this as a guild, you want to
ensure that the rewards benefit the guild.  I'm just glad we don't
have a point system.  (We use a class-rep system.  For no-drops, raid
leader or senior officer present awards looting rights based on need.
For droppable, multiclass items class reps work it out behind the
scenes and generally award the items the next night.)
