I am a little disappointed in the voice tell feature. Some of the
voice just are goofy, and if my DE wants a heal, calling the cleric a
fool isn't a good way to get one. Is is me, or does the High Elf Male
voice sound like a glam rocker? The Gnome female just sounds like a
chipmunk or like one of Santa's elves gone wrong.

I know I can change this but, if I add a voice tell file to my own
machine, that doesn't mean the other person will heard that voice.

Is this correct, if I add a personal voice tell file on my machine the
other person will not hear that file but a playback of the file on
their own machine.
