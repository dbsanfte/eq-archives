 I believe they changed this so it's not the case anymore. You can
outrun NPC spells. What was changed is that if a mob started casting you
could run out of sight and the spell wouldn't hit. I'm not sure that
ever made it off test since it's been awhile. I seem to routinely outrun
spells while pulling those lame ocean giants in Storms. I'd have to pay
more attention next time to see if it that is the case.

 From Jun12_02 patch:

- NPCs are now bound by spell casting distance rules, meaning that an
NPC's spell will no longer connect from halfway across the zone

Sep04_02:

** Line of Sight Changes **

- For spells that require Line of Sight (LoS), the LoS check is now at
the beginning of the spellcast, not the end.
- Spells that require but do not have of LoS will now fail immediately.
- Harmful spells require LoS.
- Most Beneficial spells still do not require LoS.
- Bind Sight type spells do not require LoS.
- Any beneficial spell containing a Cancel Magic component requires LoS.

 Based on that I think I'm going to /bug Crypt of Decay mobs. Mobs can
chain cast on you without requiring LoS.

 All depends on how the zone was coded I'd imagine. In most cases mobs
wont bother to start casting on you if they can't see you. That seems to
be the rule in most pre-PoP zones. PoP seems to be different so far. Ok,
outdoors like PoStorms I can see why the mobs can cast through the
walls, being outdoor and all. I use it to my advantage as much as mobs
do for things like pulling the minis while leaving the rest of the
giants up for example. Actually just proximity aggro works well enough
for pulling those so you don't even have to cast on them.

 Fast forward to Crypt of Decay... Indoor zone... Run around a corner
after mob has started to cast and still get hit with the nuke. Fair
enough. I'll just wait for the mobs to come running around the corner.
Ow hey, wtf am I still being nuked when there's mobs nowhere near me and
sure as hell don't have LoS? Rez please! Thanks Verant.

 I think Verant messed up the ocean giants. They seem to stand there a
rather long time trying to cast on you but get nowhere because you're
out of range. Not to mention the pathing is about the worst I've seen
anywhere. So between bad pathing and mobs trying to cast when they can't
hit anything, it can take awhile to get pulls in. So my advice: Leave
the ocean giant camp alone and go to desert or forest. Then again I
think I may have gotten a bit off topic!
