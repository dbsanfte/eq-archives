OK, just checked, I stand corrected. You can still make the windows totally 
opaque though, so you should be able to make a visible colour scheme, even 
if you are losing some screen real estate. You might try doing what I do - 
make the window black, but set it to 75% opacity - you still get a hint of 
what is going on behind it but it is dark enough that nice bright colours 
like whites and yellows still have a high degree of contrast, even if 
you're looking at snow or something. Maybe that will be enough to satisfy 
your colour blindness...
