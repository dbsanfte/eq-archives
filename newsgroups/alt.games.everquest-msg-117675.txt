Well...Sorta figured I wouldn't see anyone bragging here, but I wanted
to be sure.  This is just a friendly thread to let people know that
currently no matter how big or how bad someone says their system is,
it will still have tremendous video lag in parts of Luclin and for
sure at large raids.  So if you see someone throwing suggestions on
more ram, better video card, faster processor etc to improve your
gaming experience to your expected level...just take caution on the
advice.

Everyone I know that plays EQ has stated that no matter what they do
to their system they still encounter video lag to the point that all
charactor models have to be turned off, all spell effects and special
effects as well during big raids.  You can not build a system yet that
will allow everything turned on and get smooth performance during big
raids!!  If anyone disagrees with me then post your numbers.  Also
post your numbers for raids.  Mine run from 7 - 14 with all charactor
models turned off, as well as all spell effects and special effects
with 30 person raids.

Oofda
