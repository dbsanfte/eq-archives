I'm really curious what you mean by this Dennis.  As far as my
personal experience, it's easier to sell things and it's easier to buy
things now that the bazaar is up and running.  Perhaps I won't get as
much for the stuff I'm selling as I would have back in EC, but that's
a small price to pay for the convenience.

And not only that, but the search features make it even easier to find
what you're looking for.  If I want a mask with wisdom on it, for
instance, I can just do a search by those parameters and find lots of
items that I never knew existed.  It's helped me become a lot more
knowledgable about what sort of things are floating around.
