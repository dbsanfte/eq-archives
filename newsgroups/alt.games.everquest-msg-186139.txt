At level 13, you're going to want to go to Paludal Caverns, off Shadow
Haven on Luclin, because almost everyone goes there around that level
nowadays. Shouldn't be very hard to find a group there, unless all the
groups are full already. In Paludal, you can make a level an hour or
so until a bit over level 20 if you get into a group that isn't
incompetent.

Personally I find PoP worthwhile for the teleports alone (I have no
46+ characters, so I can't go to the planes, either), and for casters
you can start doing the focus effect item quests around 20.
