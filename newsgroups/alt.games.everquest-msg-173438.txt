This is indeed true.  And be prepared to zone out if you get adds, or early charm
breaks, or you think one of the trees is looking at you funny... mobs in PON hit
quite hard, especially on a soloing druid.

I duo'd with druids doing this style of hunting, on and off, along with enchanters;
with a cleric partner who is fast on the SR key, and can root or stun mobs quickly,
time wasted zoning out is a lot lower, my partners report that their exp per hour
was actually better partnered with me than solo, depsite me doing little to
contribute to the fights themselves, due to time lost zoning in and out.  I also
Chealed the pets in most of these camps; yes, we lost the "two mobs dying for the
price of one" advantage, but we knew for certain that the mob we'd already charmed
was charmable, and he was already buffed up with haste etc.; since I generally had
a surplus of mana, the Cheal cost wasn't a big deal.

Doing this with Enchanter partners was less functional.  Enchanter enhanced pets
kill mobs quicker, of course, but the pet isn't snared, nor is its target.
Enchanters, even with Virtue on, are also somewhat more fragile than druids, and of
course we ran slower, with just run 3 on instead of SOEs.  These were quite skilled
druids, and not highly skilled enchanters, however, in retrospect, so the edge
might have come mainly from skill rather than class specific weaknesses.

In either case, note that since the "pet" mob is haste (and with the chanter, the
target mob is slowed) its the pet which just broke charm who is the big risk.  If
possible, keep the target rooted, keep the pet targetted, so you can deal with the
big risk ASAP and then worry about re-establishing the fight afterwords.

Playing my bard, I use radically different tactics.  There's little I can do to
buff my pet, on the other hand, I can stay far faster than any mob I'm fighting.
Charm duration is also much shorter than that of druids or enchanters.  So I
deliberately use the "disposable pet" system, and in fact often get several mobs to
fight one pet, damaging the pet faster, damage to the "swarm" mobs is almost
incedental to this system.  Get the pet nearly dead very fast (with three or four
of his buddies beating on him) then finish him off via normal means before plucking
the next victim out of the swarm.  A druid might have some luck with this scheme
too, particularly since she'll have a better DS (my SS bracer does help a bit in
damaging the whole swarm) but I'm not sure its practical.

Sadly, I don't think I can pull this off in PON, the mobs will be too high level
for my 39 charm and I don't see another on the list till.. good god, 64?  There
must be something I'm overlooking, is the 39 charm cap related to my level, and not
a hard cap like the various mez songs have?
