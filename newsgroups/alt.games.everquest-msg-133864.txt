In all the research that has been done, no particle of the virus
called HIV can be found anywhere in the tissues of most AIDS patients.
What has been found in a percentage of AIDS patients is the *antibody*
against the virus called HIV. In fact, the famous HIV blood test does
not test for the virus itself, but for the HIV antibody. In simple
terms, someone who has tested HIV Positive has not been found to have
the HIV virus, but to have the antibodies against HIV.

Having the antibody against a virus means that the body's immune
system -- at some point in the past -- detected the presence of the
virus called HIV by means of its T4 "helper" cells, sent out the
Killer T-cells to destroy all traces of the active virus itself (which
is why no active HIV virus can be found in most HIV Positive AIDS
patients), and developed special agents (antibodies) to combat any
future harm from this particular invader. In short, being HIV Positive
means that the body's immune system was functioning perfectly at the
time, and all threats from whatever the virus called HIV might do had
been neutralized within weeks after "infection."

I may have been mistaken about the flu-like symptoms - I can't seem to
find the documentation that supports it.

PS: Viral mutation is not proof of evolution, but that is an argument
for another post :)
