So you personally guarantee any change to that end would be implemented in
such a way as to not impact the raider's "quality of life" by catering to an
admittedly slim minority of EQ's total population?

I'll sum up my opinion of Sony's likelihood of accomplishing that with a
simple "No thanks".  =)

Also worth noting is nowhere have I implied that the "loot whores" were bad
players.  On the contrary, they are often some of the best.

Kind of my whole point of this discussion.

EQ's population shrinkage, barring unforeseen events, will occur at a slow
and dependable pace, unlike the tremendous hits it took from the double shot
of WoW and it's own sequel.  Server merges will come at a far slower pace. 
You are essentially asking to accelerate that pace and "rip the bandaid off"
to get the hurt out of the way quickly.  In real life, I tend to be that
sort of person, but I don't really think it's healthy to treat a game that
way.
