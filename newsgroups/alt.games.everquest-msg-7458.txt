I am forming a hunting party to make money over the next several days
killing Hill Giants in the Rathe Mountains.
For our level they are one of the best sources of  platinum in the game.

  I intend on forming a group of   3 - 6 players in the level 30 - 40 range
(I am a 35 Paladin). Our goal will be to have no one die, minimum downtime
and maximum number of giant kills.

             Tentative schedule would be  8pm - 12 or 1 pm Eastern Time,
Thursday, Friday and next Monday,  9 am - 9 pm Eastern,Saturday with several
breaks, and 5 pm - 11pm Sunday.

                Depending on who responds and what there time constraints
are these times could be adjusted.   The idea would be to hunt hill giants
for 30 hours in the next several days.   Depending on final group size,
efficiency and recycle time... I think it is possible for each participant
to come away with  2500+ Platinum.

     If you are interested  email me today at imjonah2@hotmail.com.  Thanks.
