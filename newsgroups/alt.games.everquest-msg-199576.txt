Your first post in response to him -

His response to this -

A part of your next response -

>Having heard the phrase "painfully stupid" many times, I feel
>compelled to ask:  does it actually hurt?

Now I take his response as someone who is truly trying to understand why
anyone wouldn't use KEI when it is available (hence it's plain insane NOT to
have KEI).  ie I can't believe someone wouldn't have KEI.  I still do not
see it as insulting.  I guess it's just a word/definition/perception thing.
The word hate is a good example.  To me it doesn't have a very strong
connotation.  To others, when I say man "I hate xxx" they see my response as
being extremely harsh when to me it is not so.

My position is that KEI being usuable on lower levels is a bug.  It should
be fixed.  I can't stand dependency on it as I am someone who likes to be
completely independent in the game.  I see the argument from your side of
things as I am in the same mindset.  I still find his statement as one not
meant as insulting, while yours after that as being meant to be extremely
insulting (which is to be expected since you've taken his statement to be
extremely insulting).
