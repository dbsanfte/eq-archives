The "disagreement" may be more about our individual experiences and
the player make-up of our different servers than anything else.

How long does one of your guild trips usually take? (Time to organize,
travel, break-in to camp spot, etc) On my server all of the major
areas Seb, Kael, and ME are usually perma-camped. The first hour of
guild "free nights" is usually spent popping into zones and doing a
"camp check". Since I only play an average of 1-2 hours a night, the
first hour can easily be taken up just finding a place to hunt with
the guild. Raid nights (usually planned ahead for faction/gem/gear
farming) are no different, since everyone 50-60 is looking for the
same things. Part of the problem is most likely the fact that Innoruuk
has never split, and is one of the oldest servers (I think it went
live with the second batch of servers post-launch)

>You can have a hell of a lot of fun getting to level 60 without raiding.

You are making the assumption that I care about or want to get to
level 60. I don't

I am stopping me (which is due to my personal taste/view).

I don't care about dings, but the guild (my friends) do. They want to
be a 55-60 guild, and raid all of the higher level content. 

I don't care about loot, but the guild(my friends) do. They want to
"raid" in the zones that drop the items they feel they need so that
they can do the higher level content.

You cannot plan ahead or foresee how your friends and guildies will
"change" when you hit the higher levels. It really pains me to turn my
back on my friends, but our goals and personal direction in the game
do not match. There is no "hell of a lot of fun getting to level 60"
when that isn't your goal, and the people you "grew-up" with focus
their attention solely on the drive to 60. It is not their fault for
changing, and it is not my fault for staying the same. It simply means
a parting of ways.

That is why you see so many guilds fall apart at higher levels. Some
players gravitate to the Uber-Guilds, and others retire and/or start
alts. Even when you stay with and group/guild with the sub-50s after a
guild breakup, they will eventually "grow up", which leads to the same
type of break up that you faced the last time.

>At level 51-53
>you can do the xp/group/socializing thing with your friends from
>36-60...it's a fantastic level in regards to flexibility.

A level 53 grouping with a level 36 is mostly baby sitting. I would
rather be 36 grouped with a 36. It is much more challenging, and every
time I re-roll I get to experience EQ from a different perspective.

It basically boils down to this. Retiring a character at level 50 is
no different to me than retiring at level 60 with maxed AA points.
When I feel the time has come to move on, I move on. I am not going to
change how I play (which is very casual), just to keep up with people
who have higher goals or are more ambitious than I am.

The original poster asked if anyone felt that the higher level game
was boring. I answered honestly. I find the time requirements (to
ding, or to camp/raid) and the focus on gear to be nothing but tedius
and boring.

YMMV :-)
