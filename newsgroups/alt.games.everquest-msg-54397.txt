That's the ghoulbane quest skellie. (one of them, anyway.) For a while
he was up front there, and I wouldn't even consider taking my baby necro
in there at level 11/12. But fortunately, Verant apparently realized
that they had turned Najena into an empty deathtrap for anyone of a
level appropriate to hunt there, so they moved them. There used to be
four of them right on the top floor where low levels would want to hunt.
One near the entrance, one behind the tentacle terror area, one just
before the elementals hall, and one in the freezer. 
  Now they seem to be down in deeper. You have to go back in deep to
where you make the left turn to head down towards Najena's room. There's
one at the base of the stairs, and once you get past him, there's one on
the far side of the lake that you have to swim under to get to Najena's
room too. He'll aggro as soon as you reach the water. (And I think he
fearlessly aggros on *anybody*. Jumped my 51 warrior every time. Brave
little bastard.)
  Anyway, the point is, with those moves, I think Najena is back to
being "doable" for the lowbies again. Of course, just like any dungeon,
you'll have to use good tactics and pulling strategies to survive, but
it's doable.
