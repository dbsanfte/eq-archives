and this statement couldn't be more correct.... NOT IN MY BACKYARD!!!!
Terrorism has been going on... but not in the US...  as far as I
understand, we have not entirely acted on terrorism that has happened
to US embassies and people outside of the US.

We do not IGNORE as you so wrongly say.... we do not react on it
because we do not have 10,000 people who just died in a short amount
of time, so some fucking bastard could prove a point that the
capitalist pigs are bad people....   You couldn't be more wrong.

What about the countries that these "terrorist attacks happen 
*elsewhere* in the world on a what, daily basis?"  
They should be addressing the issue just as we intend to... (oh that's
right were supposed to clean your backyard also?)

Who put the most forces to help Kuwait?
Who went to Panama?
(no america is not the perfect country, all peoples make mistakes...)

Very sorry, the events of yesterday still are fresh, and your
statements may have some validity (not matter how small they are).

So, when was the last terrorists attack that happened outside of the
US that has taken as much life? (i'm not saying there is or isn't, i'm
just an american and we tend to IGNORE all other countries problems
because were so fucking great (sarcasm if you cant get it))
