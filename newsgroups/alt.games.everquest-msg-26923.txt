Without knowing what you're looking for how is someone supposed to answer
that?

Are you looking for a guild that'll accept anyone?
Are you looking for a guild that's big into raids?
Are you looking for a guild that's big into social stuff?
Are you looking for a 1337 guild?

Oh, I bet you're looking for one of those psychic guilds.  Well, they're out
there, they just decided a month before you created your EQ account that
they didn't want you.
