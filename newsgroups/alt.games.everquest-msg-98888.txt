I have a problem the GM's and techs I've emailed can't or won't help me
with.

My PC is a PIII 733 256Mb ram, inside is a TNT2 Ultra 32Mb with a MX400
soundcard. Works fine on any game except EQ.

Here's my problem.
In neary every zone there is an area that will cause me to start lagging and
then disconnects me from my dialup ISP.
Some examples are; BW as I enter/leave the castle to Chardok; FM at ruins
bind point; Ill Omen and FoB as I approach Cabilis; Tim Deep on the wharf;
North Freeport's shops. There's more zones it happens but I'd need a map of
Norrath ;). this only started happening since Luclin started the patching.
When your chars are post 50, and ya die from it - it bites. GM's must know
me by now 'cos my last 4 petitions have been ignored.

So if anyone has any ideas or had similar experiences, please post - I'd
appreciate the help TIA.

Phil
