    This is something raid guilds have wanted for a long time. It sucks,
sucks, sucks to not be able to raid with your friends if you missed one day
of raiding. The mechanics of it sound appropriate, too.

    It's nice to see that big RZ raid on my server got something changed in
EQ. Anyone want to bet RZ is one of the restricted flag mobs now?

    Hmm. This is going to make "boxing" (casting a res on a cleric during a
wipeout, then having them res in to res everyone else after the coast is
clear) a lot harder. I wonder if they viewed boxing as an exploit, or if
there was a way to make it an exploit (like exploring with a res box up)?

    The only way to make these damned quests friendly is to make it so doing
the quest counts the exact same as killing the boss mob that gets you in the
same zone. As it is now, doing the quest for, say, CoD does NOT allow you to
get proper credit for a Bertox kill and therefore does not allow you to
progress. You must kill Grummus to have the Bertox flag "count", quest or no
quest. And having a quest just to do XP somewhere is lame, pure and simple.

    Booooo! Well, I guess my warrior is about to destroy what was one of the
best 2HS training weapons in the game.

    There's a lot of CLR weapons that have this problem. Hopefully they'll
do a review of all weapons that are non-dual wield class only and fix all of
them.

    So no more turning in my Ethereals to the Enchanter vendor to get
Pacification for my fellow clerics? ;-)

> - Corrected issues with the quest from the Iksar Hermit.

    LOL, still broken after all these years. I wonder if one of the devs was
reading The Safehouse where someone found some broken text possibly related
to the quest? There's a first - devs getting game info from The Safehouse!

    Good, too many stupid tactics were resulting. Yay, bind point rushing
Fennin Ro!

    There's a hatch in Solusek Ro's chamber that you open and drop through
to enter Fire. Any rogue with SoS and the flags required to enter that room
can enter Fire without any risk. We had to help one rogue from another guild
that zoned into Fire before they'd killed Solusek Ro, and didn't know where
the zone out was. "OMG, help me before I die and can't get a res!"

    I'm honestly surprised this isn't a feature of more mobs. Crap repopping
after a zone crash just encourages people to find ways to crash zones.

    Wonder what wall you could fear kite some of them into.

    Hmm. I was there last night, and they were enraging just fine. I wonder
what this means.

    I guess they finally decided that shamans being able to cure poisons and
diseases well, but clerics only being able to cure poisons well, was out of
whack. Seems like a petty nerf, though.

    This was well-known. Charm is a detrimental spell, so as long as your
pet is still charmed you can't cast it on them and have it do anything.
Guess all those nouveau-riche ENCs soloing up a storm now were confused!

    Lots of neat little fixes, too. Hope that continues. Wonder how many
emergency patches we'll get?
