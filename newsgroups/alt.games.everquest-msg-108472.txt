But that's the class you CHOSE.  It says right up front, on the
sticker, CAUTION -- this class will never be best at anything.

Ordinarily, that doesn't matter a bit.  Soloing, xp grouping, you're
fine.  On a raid, everyone wants to fill the niches with the best
possible classs for that niche.

How can you possibly complain when you've *chosen* a utility class
that you knew from the start would never be best at anything, to
compensate for being second best at virtually everything?
