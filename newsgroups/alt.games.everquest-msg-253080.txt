I got a buddy key and promptly forwarded it to my friend.  He tried it and
it said that this key has already been used.  Called EQ support.  They gave
him another key.  Already used.  Still on the phone.  Got two more.  Both
used. The tech was scratching his head.  Let me get back to you in 15-20
mins.  To his credit, he called back.  Gave him another key.  This one
should definitely work.  Already used.  My friend was pretty frustrated.
Tech guy apologized profusely and told him he can be in on EQ2 Beta if he
wants as compensation for his troubles.  He said sure.

So, anyone else having problems with keys?  This seems a bit frustrating and
unusual.
