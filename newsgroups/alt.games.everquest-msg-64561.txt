*shrug* I'm not going to whine. I'm going to say that Verant is a company
that has shadier business practices than Microsoft has even THOUGHT OF, but
I'm not going to whine. I'm one of those Win95 users. I simply don't have
$200 to upgrade my OS (Windows 98 does not work on my machine, Windows ME is
garbage, Windows 2k... I may as well install Windows XP, which costs $200
for the upgrade).

Unless Verant puts Win95 support back in or issues one HELL of an apology
within 48 hours, I'm cancelling my account. If they don't want my business,
they won't have it. 'nuff said.

On the good side, my RL friend who's still playing will quite likely
appreciate the 75K worth of gear I'm going to hand him when I cancel.
