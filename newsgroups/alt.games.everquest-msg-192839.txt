Been in that situation and did the same thing...what i'm finding makes a
difference "sometimes" is rooting the add then mezzing.  Good luck, if you
find a better strategy let me know...root seems to get resisted less then
mez and it doesn't matter if it lasts "long" just long enough to tash and
mez.
