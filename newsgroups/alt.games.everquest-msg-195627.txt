Call of Earth doesn't have any HP regen, but it does give a nice AC
boost.  http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1462&source=Live

Force of Nature give a 3 point DS, and 3 points of HP regen a tick,
along with 15 to your ATK.  Unfortunately, it only lasts 15 minutes
vs. CoE's 1 hour. http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1462&source=Live

I'll avoid talking about any stacking issues since I've already made
an ass out of myself on that topic tonight. :-)
