I can't recall a single time that I have died due to being unable to channel
a gate, mind you I haven't tried too many times, as I don't often have gate
memorized.  I have channeled through drowning and being eaten by fishies in
Blackburrow, I have channelled through being eaten by a red to me killer
shark.  I'm not saying I got the first one off, but I kept trying until I
succeeded.
