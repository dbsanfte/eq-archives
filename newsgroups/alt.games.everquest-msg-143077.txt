I am a level 43 rogue, right now at shadow heaven. I stopped playing my main
(ie, the rogue) quite sometime as I have no idea what to do next. Should I
go DL and get group and keep leveling? or any good quest to work on. At the
old days I stay in Lower Guk and try running between the vendor and LG to
farm PP.

My eqpt is so so only since I only get a Slim coated as main and a 9/22 as
offhand, got quite pcs of ravenscale right now....
