Anyway, on that note, I did end up installing WinXP, and the crashes
seem to have dissapeared. I ran EQ for a little while, and I've been
playing Severance for several hours now, as opposed to a few minutes ETC
(estimated time to crash) under Win2k.

The OS itself is complete bollocks, though... It's funny how difficult
everything becomes when they try to make it "easy". Hopefully, I should
probably be able to customize it to cut back on the bullshit.
