Greetings all,

	I am taking a small poll to get oppinions on what a worthy reward for a
player run event would be. The event would involve running from Akanon
to Qeynos. The possible prizes could/would be a full suit of ring along
with a FS weapon and shield (possibly shiny brass). Do you think this
would be ample reward for such a long run at a level of 10 or less?

Feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
