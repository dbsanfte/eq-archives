"Easier" in absolute terms; I didn't mean to imply that *he* should go
after Ry'gorr. "Easier" in terms of: no need to wreck faction with
Faerie and/or Gnomes acquiring quest items (or paying someone else to
do so), nor to sidetrack into required faction building with NPCs; no
need to pay more for enchanted platinum than the item resells for some
cases; no need to fight Sand Giants (or, again, pay someone else to do
so), nor to enter Mistmoore looking for (no-drop) Mistmoore Granite;
no need to travel hither and yon looking for contested mobs who drop
additional quest items, and so on.

That said, Ro armor seems to cost, on average, slightly more per item
than Ry'gorr on The Rathe - your server may vary. Given the
comparitive hassle of making the stuff, I'm not surprised.
