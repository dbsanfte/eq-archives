Dump the rings and get 6ac/65hp rings.
You are a tank you need AC and HP.
Then save up for Vallorium rings of gallantry.

Your face mask sucks, no AC and no Hit points.
You are a paladin not a cleric. Earrings are also weak in
the AC HP area.

I agree with everything Bryan said as well, get some heraldic
and bag the fungi for downtime and soloing.

Also depending on what race you are there are some nice
racial armors.
