It is not "childish" to threaten to leave, or whatever. Different people
want different things from Everquest, just the same as different people
see different uses for mobile phones, the internet, etc, etc, etc.

If you are not into killing as a fundamental requirement in "your online
society", then you won't be that much interested in EQ, which I think
was part of the original posters statement.

Other people had different reasons why they don't like EQ overall, but
may like only a fraction of it. Some people have already said that they
only like a certain level range. Some people have become pissed off
because they have to group to level with certain changes, etc, etc.

Agree totally with your comments, but there are "different people" that
have already said that saying so is just whinging and being childish
