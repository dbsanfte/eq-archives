You might consider a "sacrificail tank."  The sacrificial tank hits
Xana and his "autoriposte for 10 seconds" discipline at the very
beginning of the fight.  This will give the debuffers and slower time
to do their jobs.  Not long before the first tank's riposte discipline
ends, a second tank using defensive jumps in to aggro  Xana so that
Xana switches to a tank instead of the slower.  The rest of the raid
is behind Xana and only engages after the second tank calls for
assist.  Use your heal over time spell on the sacrificial tank and the
real tank before they engage to heal the spell damage from Xana.

If the rest of the raid is not getting hit by AoE, druid group regen
might be enough for the raid.  If druid regen isn't keeping the rest
of the raid alive, cleric group heals or heals over time might be
better; then you can use the druids in the CHC.  If druids are in the
CHC, don't group them together; intersperse the druids between clerics
or tell them to heal slightly sooner in the cycle than the clerics.

If you absolutely feel the heal will be a waste of mana, then duck out
and CALL it so the next guy knows you have ducked out. Better to widen
the time in the CHC between casts instead.
