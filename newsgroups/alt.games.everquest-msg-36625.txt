As a human you should be apprehensive to the merchants and Guards in Qeynos
and Dubious to the Temple of life and Knights of Thunder (Gnoll teeth and
subsequent Moonstone quests will help there, do NOT hand in any bandit
sashes) I don't remember any problems with my Human SK above ground in
Qeynos, not so popular in other cities tho.

You can bank even if KoS (assuming no guards are there to kill you) as I can
bank in Runnyeye (Banker attacked me once and I carried on banking while he
was trying to hit me)
