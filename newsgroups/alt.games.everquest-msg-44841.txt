Maybe you don't understand the TLC.  Quest items will still drop, you
can still loot the HQ cat skins or whatever farmers are after. You
might not get the totem of zek, big deal, its crap anyways, usually
use the stuns up next couple fights anyways.

So a level 60 can't farm mid-ranged items, big friggin deal, don't go,
but take your lvl 20 monk twink. 

on second thought, don't go with either
