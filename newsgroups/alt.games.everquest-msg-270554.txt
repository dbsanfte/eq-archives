An MMOG doesn't rule that out. City of Heroes and World of Warcraft
are both very solo-friendly, which means you can play by your own
schedule. You also have to option there of teaming up with other
players. In the case of WoW, it's common to find a group that'll get
together just long enough to do a quest and go their separate ways. I
kinda like this sort of "on the fly" grouping myself, others don't.
Perhaps for "cute-ish", you could check into Ragnarok Online. Playable
solo. Not everyone's cup of tea, though.

If she insists on offline, I can't really think of anything -new- that
might interest her. Civilization III is still good (and relatively
inexpensive even with the Conquests expansion). For an FPS/fantasy
adventure type game with a gothy dark, but very cool, theme to it,
there's American McGee's Alice. Then there's Arcanum, a "steampunk"
setting game with a kinda Baldur's Gate-ish gameplay style. Diablo II
is still good.

Like I said, nothing new that I can think of. I haven't followed too
closely the release of offline PC games lately. Sorry. ><
