Damn, you're thick-headed.  So, since it seems to have sailed over your
head, let me spell it out for you.

I'm doing this solely to annoy you.

Frankly, this isn't something I tend to do. Normally after spending half a
day actually trying to discuss it with you and getting nothing but insults
for my effort, I would've just plonked you.  Most others have, y'know ...
you've been so fixated on me that you probably haven't noticed yet that
responses to your tired "Show me" line have been practically non-existant
except for mine.  And make no mistake ... the ol' KF is where you'll end up
once the fun here has played out.  Frankly, it's almost played itself out at
this point.

But for now, it's a blast seeing how riled you can get.

Haven't you figured that out yet?

You're still responding to my every post, just as you'll respond to this
piece of bait ... so I guess not.

Crash
