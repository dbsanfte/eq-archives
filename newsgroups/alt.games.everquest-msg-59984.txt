I showed this tonight to a GM that hadn't heard of them.  GMs do not need
keys and can, therefore, use the firepot.  I also told him about the one in
Neriak 3rd Gate.  He couldn't officially say where they lead but did reveal
that they'd not yet been implemented in the game.

Without saying more, I will concur that the symbol on the QCat pot is the
exact same as the one in TimDeep which leads to Erudin....
