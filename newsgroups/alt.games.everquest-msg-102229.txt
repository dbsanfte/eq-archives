I usually don't stop what I am doing to type. So yes i use np (no problem),
k (okay), LOL (laughing out loud), TY (thank you) etc. I have also been know
to type lehp for help :o) My thoughts got ahead of my fingers I guess. I am
not ignorant, maybe I am a bit lazy but, typically its just that I am busy
and if the person(s) on the recieving end of my tell or chat doesn't
understand what I am trying to communicate they can always ask. The only
time I have had to clarify was OTM, had someone new to raiding along and
they just didn't know.
I will agree that it is confusing at first I had to learn BRB, BRT, OMW,
OOM,  like everyone else but I have the capacity to learn and I trust that
others do also. Frankly I would rather be fighting a mob than typing out
long sentences. One more point, every industry that I have been associated
with has its own shorthand and abbreviations whether it be for specific
forms or processes I see no reason why EQ should be different. BTW, in those
same industries there are always people that bitch and whine about all the
abbreviations too, its usually the ones that can't keep up with the lingo
:o)

PS big joke we play on the new hires:
"Did you make sure to fill out the ID 10T form so you will get paid?"

thats "idiot"  ID10T
