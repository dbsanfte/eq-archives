You should probably not have started on a Zek server if you are just
starting the game, unless PvP is an aspect that you look forward to.  Go to
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/ and over on the left there is a tab about
special servers.  If you start a new character you will not lose your old
one.  He will still be there if you decide to go play him.  A new character
on a new server, which I would recomend after reading your posts, will start
out with nothing but a weapon, some food and water, a backpack, some
bandages, and 2 spells if you play a class that starts with spells.  On
non-Zek servers there is no PvP to speak of, so you only have NPCs to deal
with killing.  You'll start out in your hometown.  Use backspace to bring up
the ingame map to find your way around town.
The first few levels you don't really need to group with anyone.  Levels 1
to 4 are basically the same for everyone.  Find a bat that cons white or
blue, hit it with your weapon until it is dead, lather, rinse, repeat.  If
you have questions about game dynamics you can ask them here, or ask some
players you group with.  You might try joining the newgroup serverwide
channel.  I am rarely in there, but I imagine people there would be willing
to answer a few questions.  To join you type "/join serverwide.age:age"
without the quotation marks.  Perhaps even more importantly, report back and
let us know how you are doing, and what new server you are trying.
