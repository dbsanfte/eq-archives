For an XP group slow is about that powerful. Not only because it
massively reduces the amount of healing but because it also reduces
the spikes that tend to kill the tank. It doesn't matter how much
you're healing for if it hits a corpse.

Mind you the shaman heals still suck bigtime. A 2K heal is pitiful
in PoP and relying on crits is not a good strategy. Also a shaman
concentrating on slow isn't doing any healing at all, and if they
get multiple resists (or adds) things get very risky. So you would
still want a healer other than the shaman if possible.

No idea, my shaman isn't that high. I do know that whether the mob
can be slowed has a large effect on how likely it is people will XP off
it.
