Last Rose Of Summer
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

North to south the time in less days of all girl
To know the shadow begin to grow much grow
As sunset spy is deep and lonely
I give you this' last rose of summer
Talking of my only love
So that with this wiggle man will tears the earth
All around seems dark and cold
These both remind you of the time
You know was wrong oh my lady
Don't despair all the nature seem be in rest
In sleep she's well
Till what day not so very far from now
To the opening the first rose but I shall return
Last rose of summer
Side Two=20

I don't have a clue what this means. It's a beautiful song though.
