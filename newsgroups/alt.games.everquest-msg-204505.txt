 As a guild people need compromise and work together to accomplish
anything worthwhile. There;s just some sacrifices that people have to
make. Obviously the individual is free to decide if they wish to make
them or not but if a guild wants to have focused goals everyone needs to
be on the same path. This includes things like key quests, faction
(especially fixable faction), focusing on 1 main character, etc.

 It seems you just don't enjoy the high-level game and prefer to do
things your own way. Obviously there's nothing wrong with that. But
sometimes it's a lot more fruitful to be part of something larger... To
be part of a guild that's focused on progressing and not rehashing the
same levels and zones over and over again.

 Oh and Emperor key does not take 2 months of your life. That's way
beyond exaggeration. Unless you mean Vex Thal key as well. Even then
there's no way it takes 2 months. Emperor key is 4 parts. 3 of them can
be camped by a simgle group. The other piece takes a raid, or at least a
few strong groups, and you can bang out 10 parts easily in a reasonable
amount of time.
