You and every other Cleric (and post-50 Paladins, and don't Necros get a
similar spell?)

Before I launch into some unsolicited advice on playing Marrtuk
I want to make one thing very clear:  However you play your
characters, don't lose sight of the most important thing, which
is to continue to supply us with the occasional narrative here.
All other considerations pale into insignificance in comparison!  ;)

Group Marrtuk!  With an Enchanter in the group!  Twinked as he is
you can tank most any blue mob, and many evens, yellows, and reds
as well.  A well played Paladin is tremendously group-friendly, as
an MT, as an off-tank, as a root-parker, as a caster life assurance
provider, as an enemy caster neitralizer, as a back-up healer when
main healer is a Druid/Shaman (or overwhelmed Cleric, happens even
to the good ones sometimes).  Paladins are not particularly good
soloers, and post-40 soloing with my Paladin was pretty boring most
of the time even with KEI).  Groups are where Paladins shine.  And
Enchanters are your friends (44+ BLs too), because you don't spend
half as much time sitting with a Paladin as you do with a "real"
caster.  Partner with most any class.  Pet classes, Druids, and
Rangers worked best for me when I was playing Kaev.  It tends to be
kinda boring to partner with a Cleric (so add more people), and
Paladin+Wizard isn't all that hot either (again, get more people).
Anyhow, in case you haven't figured it out yet, I'm urging you to
play Marrtuk in groups!
