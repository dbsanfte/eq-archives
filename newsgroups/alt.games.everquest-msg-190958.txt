 Ha, my mistake. I was looking at it on my laptop, which I don't
actually use to connect to SOE servers even though I have EQ installed.
So my guilds.dat file was blank. However, it still isn't as viewing
friendly as it used to be. It used to be a pure text file in the past,
unless I'm totally thinking of something else. 

 Although now that it's binary I'm sure someone could write up a quick
parser for it. Any volunteers? Pasketti!

 That is the full guildname.
