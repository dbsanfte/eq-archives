Saint Angela Merici says that do remember that the Saints do enjoy hearing from
you, and do want to help you if it is feasible for a betterment in your manner
of life, or what you request to be.

REVELATION DELIVERED THROUGH FRANCES M. KLUG  
ON JANUARY 10,2003 AT 12:18 P.M. 

     SAINT ANGELA MERICI

    “I am Saint Angela Merici. 

     I smile when I mention My Name, because at one time the little one The
Father uses to repeat so many Words that the Saints say, she attended a place
that was named after me.  Her remarks to me were always attentive and
interesting. 

     At this time throughout the world, it is sad for me to say that the Saints
Here in the Heavens are not remembered in the right way; in fact, very rarely
is Their Name called upon to help in some way.  I do not say, ‘Do not pray to
The Holy Father, The Heavenly King, and The Mother of everyone and everything,
but do remember that the Saints do enjoy hearing from you, and do want to help
you if it is feasible for a betterment in your manner of life, or what you
request to be.’ 

     I will close My Words.  I know My Time is short with you, but when The
Father requested I speak today, I said, ‘Thank You, My Holy King, it is a
privilege for Me to partake in this Gift of Your Divine Love for the Souls, but
also, the physical aspects of millions of human lives.”
