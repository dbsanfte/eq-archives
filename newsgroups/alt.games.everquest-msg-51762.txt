I got really burned out on fighting and leveling
the other day so I figured it was time for a
change of pace.  I  made it to lvl 39 but it's
time for a break.  I decided to go into the
trading business and in one day I'm making good
$$.  After selling a few items on my character I
started with 800pp and headed to the tunnel.  From
there on out it was buy low, sell high.  Drakel
Icegrinder for 300, bought it.  Sold it a few
minutes later for 600.  Mithril BP for 500, bought
it and sold it half an hour later for 800. I even
bought a BABS for 150 and some guy offered me 800
for it.  I felt kind of bad taking his money but
he seemed all to eager to hand it over.

In my opinion this is more fun than fighting and
leveling.  I'm gonna do this for weeks and weeks.
Heck I may give up fighting alltogether.  Why am I
just now discovering this?
