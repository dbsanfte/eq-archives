Yeah, when you hit level 10 there should have been a big red warning
indicating that you would lose experience and your stuff would stay with
your corpse when you die. At this point, you should definitely be more
careful when you're risking death. Make a hotkey or just type /loc when you
think you might have taken on more than you can handle, that way you should
be able to find your corpse on your own if you die.

Failing that, bards, necromancers, and shadowknights (not sure what level)
should all be able to help find your corpse. Whether or not they'll want to
is another question. If you get desparate, offer to pay a small fee for
their services. If they do it for free, it might be nice to offer them
something afterwards, anyway. Most likely if they didn't ask for money in
the first place they probably won't accept your offer, but some might
genuinely need the donation.

Good luck!

FYI, back in the old days I think you had to loot your corpse every time you
died, even at level 1. Hehe, so level 10 is not so bad.
