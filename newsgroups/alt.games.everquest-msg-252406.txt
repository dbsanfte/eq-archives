I saw the movie before I read the book, myself... The movie is dead 
silly, no question, but the bug battles are certainly awesome. As for 
the SS uniforms, well... after reading the book, I defintely see the 
point Verhoeven was trying to make. Whether I agree with it or not is an 
issue that I won't even go into, having seen my share of horrible, 
horrible Heinlein-fuelled flamewars in Science Fiction newsgroups. :)
