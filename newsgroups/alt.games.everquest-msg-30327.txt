LOL!

Yes, you got it, we all watch Dog training shows, and only have sex once a
month, with the lights off!

I must not be English then! Never watch TV...play EQ instead, and my sex
life...well, Springer would blush!, never said there was anything wrong with
being a perv!

Bah you only drive on the right because when Henry Ford built that first
pile of crap, he thought he was building a right hand drive, but didn't know
his left from his right hand......look closely at old pics of him, his shoes
are on the wrong feet! yuk yuk yuk

Ain't at least half your ancestor's from somewhere in Europe anyway, you
guys just insulted ole great great grandpa billybob!

NARF!
