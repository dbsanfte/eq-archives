Annie, I think you might want to think this one through.  I see far too much
potential for abuse.  (Uberfolk, help me out here.)  I can imagine
Uber_Guild_01 racing not from zone to zone, but from server to server,
ripping up the high-end named for easy loot.  "Put out the word!  FV
crashed, everyone gather at the Universe Portal ASAP.  We'll buff up and hit
them as soon as their server is back up, we can get to Fennin Ro, Bertie,
and be started on Xegony before they get done with their CRs.  That's good
alt twinking!"
