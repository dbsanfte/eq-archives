You should have deleted the first petition and repetitioned and
reported for the language.  Seems sony don't give a **** about play
nice only about language these days 8(

At least the KSing is gernerally redued now as most the high levels
have moved on now.  The first few nights were mad.

We had one time in the first few days with a mage KSing.  When we
called him on it he just said "oh I only want the sow boots".  So
because of that he thought it was okay that we would get no xp and his
cast offs.
