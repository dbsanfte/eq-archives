Congratulations on the weight loss.  Just out of curiosity, who's idea
was it to lose the weight?  Hers or yours?  Just to re-assure you, I
won't come back with a flame if you said hers, I am just curious.  I
also wanted to know if you planned on losing more.  If so, I may be
able to help, though I'm not sure what methods you are using.
