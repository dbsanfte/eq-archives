That's funny, I do the same when I am typing up a document etc.... not
so much for usenet / EQ.  But I was taught to do two spaces after ever
sentence in my typing class, way back in the early 80's.  Very glad I
took the class, because I keep it roughly round 45 wpm still.  Helps
alot to get messages out quick on a raid, or just quick responses....
whether witty or not.
