the ul/dl speed ratio is not fixed, but usually you can get 3-4 times 
your upload rate. One of the things it does do is realize 'hey, noone 
WANTS what he has to give, so I can't hold his upload rate against him'.

A very good reason for limiting upload rates on things like DSL 
connections is to prevent saturation of the upstream transfer. If too 
much uploading happens, it drags down the speed you can download at. 
(DSL is generally asymetric, upload << download).
