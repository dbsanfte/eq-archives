Its also another example of Verant QA being dog shit.  No quad kiters in
the beta?  Great sample of the playerbase they must have had there
because every single 60+ druid/wiz I know has quad kited at one time or
another.  Were they unaware that putting mobs that dont summon and can
be snared in an outdoor area comfortable enough to fight in w/o getting
adds would lead to quad kiting?  And whatever changes they make will
likely screw everyone in some way, just to stop a couple of classes from
advancing too fast for the vision to handle.
