Yes.  A noticeable edge in tanking, especially vs. raid targets (and
/disc defensive already goes a long ways towards the latter), because
that's what Warriors do.  And some improvement to their agro-control,
preferably something distinctive and unique to Warriors that is
situationally superior to the knights' approach of "get lots of hate
fast".  Something that would briefly stop a mob at or under the
Warrior's level from rushing over to the caster snack bar, with a
reuse time short enough to make it useful in an XP group (less than
five minutes for sure, probably more like 2 minutes), and not a /disc.
Then add to that something like Davian's suggestion to reduce or even
remove the offensive penalty from /disc defensive, and/or follow one
of the various suggestions for uncoupling Warrior disciplines (might
should do that for Monk and Rogue as well).

> That's what I would consider balanced, anyway.

Yes.  I would consider it balanced if most XP groups could choose
freely between all three tank classes (assuming equal level and
equivalent gear) without compromising their effectiveness, and
raiders taking on a challenging fight could expect a much greater
chance of success with a Warrior MT.  It would be a worthwhile
bonus if they managed to arrange it so using multiple tanks in an
XP group was a viable option.  After all, it matters little for XP
grouping which DPS class(es) you have in your group, they can be
all the same, or one each of several different classes.  DPS
stacks, it'd be way cool if tanking stacked in some way, shape, or
form.
