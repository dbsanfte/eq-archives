I do agree with the value you put into it, but I did see it for trade 
yesterday. Needless to say, I didn't even ask for approximate price.
I would imagine that there are things that could be more valuable than 
this to, say, an uber warrior who has good cloak and wants to upgrade 
his weapon and haste item. 
Again, I don't know what he was asking for, but I'm sure anything that 
is tradeable can be traded for (unless it has sentimental value).
