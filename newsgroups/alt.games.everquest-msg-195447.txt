I hate to spoil a good rant with something as tedious as math, but's
lets look at the numbers. 

At 10th lvl with a bind would skill of 50, you can bandage 13
hitpoints every 2 ticks. You loose 2 hitpoints during that time for
standing instead of sitting, so even at that level it's effectively an
extra 5 hitpoints of regen per tick. Drop that number to 4 if you're a
race with regen. Not earthshatter and expensive, but you have to
practice anyway, might as well do it during your newbie levels. 

At 25th lvl, you bandage for 16 per tick, better than a fungi. Your
main limit then is the fact that you have to fight mobs that you can
take at half hitpoints. Well, a bit over half if you use the trick of
removing hitpoint gear. 

Rgds, Frank
