which I've actually never played incidentally and as will be revealed soon,
that is ultimately why I will begin very powerful but I don't really have
the skills of a king, but will never be completely defeated, but that is
what I will want to happen. I am an interim prophet king meant to give only
one command and one message from God to France and meant only for France
assuming I can prove that my power is ordained by God and God has given me
my test which will be to randomly choose 3 single verses out of the New
Testament and deliver them in sequence of choice and deliver them in French
and since I don't know French I won't be able to tell what the verses mean
(I have a French Bible, I don't want to make it seem like I'm magically able
to translate English to French, because I am not)

Now I just have to find that darn French Bible, it always seems to come down
to being able to find things in my environment, what an annoying bother.

And if France doesn't do both what my command and the verses say they will
be destroyed utterly if I do indeed possess the divine right of kings that
is. I would assume that the antichrist will eventually destroy France if God
does not.

Going to take a breather to pray, things like this shouldn't be rushed
although God assures me it doesn't matter how much time I take and that I
should just do it.
