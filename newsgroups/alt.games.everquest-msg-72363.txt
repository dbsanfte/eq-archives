I hear THAT! I dunno - it's a give & take thing with us casters. I have no
prob SOWing  for free (or binding etc....). But you'd think that the clarity
type spells from enchanters were like some kind of holy blessing judging by
the number of enchanters that 1) offer it   2) are willing to give it if you
/ooc for it   3) are willing to part with it even if you offer 10pp for the
friggin' spell!
I don't get it - us Druids usually give the buffs for free and still take
sh*t for being a druid while the cheap-o classes won't give up the plat OR
the buffs............   Hell, I had one warrior a**hole ask for a port to
Skyfire - he was 'in a hurry'. I didn't even ask for $ --- my reward: due to
bad luck (and lag) I got killed as soon as I ported in while the jerkwad
warrior takes off in the other direction without so much as a thank you.
Lucky for me it knocked me back to lvl 48 where I spent the last 3 weeks - I
wouldn't port there again for 100pp - thanks a lot you a**wipe!
