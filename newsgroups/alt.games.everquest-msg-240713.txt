I don't think it's difficult at all, as long as you don't plan to level up
either one super-fast. I ended up switching completely to Firiona Vie from
The Nameless because I was trying to catch up with my RL buddy on FV, and
just didn't have time for my Nameless characters any more. That and I was
having more fun on FV. :) It's really not any more difficult playing on 2
servers than it is to play 2 characters on the same server, with the
exception that you can't share plat/items between servers.

My 2cp worth anyway. :)
