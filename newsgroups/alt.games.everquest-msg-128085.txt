Because the idea was to move the traders out of the zones they take up on
whatever server.
Generally it is EC of GFay, these are newbie hunting zones and all these
mules, high levels and professional beggars do not help at all.
I agree with dstep, the area given may end up too small but I think the
bazaar zone idea was a good one.
Yes it would have been nice if they could have made it an extra, free, zone
(not an existing one, though) but that just wouldn't be Verant, now, would
it?
