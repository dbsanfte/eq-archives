Ya know what they say about assumptions....

Heres the quote from the original post.

"I think he tried to give me back whatever he took, but I told him to leave me
alone.  None of my money or armor was missing, so it was probably a gnoll fur
or something useless anyway."

And really, now that I think about it... if the guy was looting her corpse,
how is it *possible* that he didn't get her money?    Money is looted
automaticly by clicking on the corpse, which you have to do to get to the
items.
