Now there is a different issue for me. I run on bertox. Back in the day i recall a comment by them (back when they had counters next to server names)
that when the counter(s) reached 2000 population they would split the server / make a new one. Bertox was well into the 1950s and over 2000 on good days.
So were a couple others. Suddenly boom. there went the counters and replaced by a up/locked/etc text. They got tired of people bitching about lag in EC 
so they made the bazaar only to lag the shit out of us in there be cramming us into a square room so your video cards have to go nuts trying to count the 100
or so people graphics behind the wall your looking at trying to lock onto 1 guy to get an item. (which brings another whole list of bugs and errors and crashing programs.)
then they come out with LDoN just to make people go into zones a lot of us don't want to go into because there wasn't anything worth the time running that far 
otherwise. now it jams more graphics into that zone lagging it out more. Now they put the con ring in. ANOTHER moving graphic (remember Guk the 1st time you 
ever went there, or warsilk woods, Burning woods.)  All those BS moving tree graphics and now they add a moving ring graphic to stall your video even more. I have a 
P4 with a 32 meg voodoo card. It still has to catch up sometimes because of all this eyecandy junk they want to put in the game. I like the con color in the name block. 
But the ring is outright overkill. The blinking name over it's head (assuming you have names on.) is enough. 

shall we go into the laws of physics and EQ next?  lol
