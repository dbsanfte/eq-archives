Looking at the System Devices entry in the Device Manager in Windows
isn't reliable enough?

Another possibility is to boot from a Linux boot CD and get a command
prompt (Linux boot CDs often have a command prompt lurking around
somewhere) and taking a look at /proc/pci.  That will often give you
more detailed information than you'll get from the motherboard
manufacturer, such as the revision of the chips.
