The fishing is great in Natimbi. To get there, simply find any of the LDoN
wayfarer's camps (in the EC tunnel, Everfrost Peaks, Butcherblock Mountains
by the GFay zone in, NRo and SRo), walk up to the Magus and say the words
"Nedaria's Landing". This will transport you to Nedaria's Landing (duh),
after which you can find the Magus standing right around the corner from you
and say to him "Natimbi". Presto, you're at the Broken Shores of Natimbi,
right on the coastline and you'll likely see a lot of folks fishing there.
There's an npc in one of the tents selling fishing supplies, too.

Happy fishing!
