/agree

  I have to both as a druid and as someone who hangs around EC breaking orc
camps for the lowbies or throwing a heal in to help someone win the fight.
If I am in a group with an enchanter and we are holding our own, I never
have a problem giving out a SOW, for heals see a cleric.
  I was just pondering about why all my friends that I have grouped with are
all 3-4 levels above me.  I guess it's because I will spend entire evenings
helping out others or building up faction rather then just leveling until it
hurts.  Of course the bad part is after all that faction work I still can't
do the Langseax yet!! Damn barbarians :p
