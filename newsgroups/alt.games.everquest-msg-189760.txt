Amen.  Our Pally had to log early the other night so our 55(?) War came to 
PoN and took over MA duties.  Huge difference in how the group mechanics 
work when you make that switch in a PoP group.

Luckily, this was a guild group and we stress group mechanics all the time.  
We made the switch to the Warrior and the Wizard and Ranger  made sure the 
mobs were rooted the second they got to camp ( I tashed and slowed on the 
snared pull ) and the Melees understand about proximity aggro with root so 
it worked just fine.  It was a whole different ball game with the Warrior, 
but if people are versed in how to deal with different group make-ups, then 
this kind of thing can -usually- be overcome with good tactics as long as 
the mobs aren't immune to the "tricks."

But, warriors do need a better way to keep aggro, there is no doubt about 
that.  No reason to nerf the Paladins or SKs, just allow the Warriors to do 
what they're best at.  I'm just glad that we're a Paladin heavy guild.  We 
only have 2 50+ warriors for those rare occasions where we'll -need- that 
warrior tanking.  By the time that becomes more necessary, we'll have a few 
more.
