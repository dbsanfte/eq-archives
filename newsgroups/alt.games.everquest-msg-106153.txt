}Well, yes, but not for purposes of this discussion.

I'm just following up to a random post in this discussion... but I thought 
this information might be relevant.

From the RoK edition of Prima's official strategy guide, page 20, in the 
jargon glossary.

Pure Caster  Caster classes who use spells as their primary skills.  
             Generally, this refers to Enchanters, Magicians, 
             Necromancers, and  Wizards. (It rarely refers to WIS-casters 
             or hybrids.) By level 30, almost all of these first four 
             classes have given up melee weapons.

Make of it what you will.  I think a little paper hat would be nice.
