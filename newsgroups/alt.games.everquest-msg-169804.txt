If you get an Affliction Haste focus item (Chrysoberyl Talisman, for
example) it will shorten Snare's casting time from 2.0 to 1.3 seconds,
quite noticeably faster than Ensnare's 1.8 (unfortunately it doesn't
help spells that already cast faster than 2.0 like Ensnare).

I mem both when I'm using Ensnare to hunt (I tend to go after yellow
or even red con mobs a lot just for the fun of it, and they take a
while to kill) and I'm someplace where I need a fast casting escape
spell (Snare does a nice job on Snow Griffins, for instance).
