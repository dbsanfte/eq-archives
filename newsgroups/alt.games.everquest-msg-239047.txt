Grats on the Vindi kill.  The BP is indeed very nice for mid-50's warriors.

If you guys are working towards becoming a high-end raiding guild, you're
certainly going about it the right way.  Teaching clerics how to do a CH
chain is very important, and Vindi is a good mob to learn on.

Good luck on your new guild.  It's great when things go well right away.  =)
