The event today went to plane of fear. A few gm mobs trained the raid
force over and over. They wouldnt allow themselves to be fought and
harmtouched people who tried. :-) Early on they used an ae silence but
I think they stopped when they realized training a raid that was
entirely silenced (there was no way to resist it) was guaranteed to
wipe it out eventually no matter how well equipped it was. Then they
just used ae slow and theirharmtouches along with an ae feign death.

Once all the gm mobs were dispatched (they came out to fight after
most the zone had been trained on us and cleared) there was about
twenty ornate molds to random, along with a few weapons (including one
175 damage 18 delay one hander that was no rent, but they may have
taken that one away :-) ).

All in all it was chaotic and not really imaginative, but it was
something, at least. :-)
