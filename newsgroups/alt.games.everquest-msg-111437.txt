Yesterday I was in Neriak. I entered I think the lowest level (its the one
where you are up on a high ledge, overlooking a pond, and you walk down a
ramp on the side that passes a waterfall).  Well when I entered I saw
someone wearing a nice dark blue (or dark coal) robe with light blue
stitching down its front and sleeves.  He was wielding a pair of dirty white
colored axes with a large blade and the ends of the handles wrapped in a
green binding.  Then I noticed the name was GREEN.  A GM.  I took a
screenshot (because they did look great).  They were standing there and
didn't notice me.  I took a screenshot of them.  I then decided to hail them
and see what happens.  I didn't know why a GM would have been standing there
(no real reason to that I could see, no other PCs, no NPC, just as if they
were AFK before zoning).  As soon as I hailed them, they waved one of their
arms over their head as if casting a spell.  Instantly they burst into a
large pillar of fire springing up from the ground, leaving a small pool of
flame where they once stood.  I immediately did a "/who all GM" and none
were online.  I don't know why they were in such a hurry to leave like that,
why they didn't respond with anything more than a pillar of fire and pool of
fizzling flame.
    Later thinking about this, I thought I should have probably /cheer or
something showing I did really like the special effects of their nice
disappearing act.
    Has anyone else seen things like this happen? Did they likely go
anonymous or possibly log off? Any thoughts on why they jumped out of there
as soon as they realized someone was there?
