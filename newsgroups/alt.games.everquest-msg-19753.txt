I got some rezzes on raids, but first time i found it worth the bother to find a
cleric to rezz me was after one of the BEEEEEEP goblin casters in FM killed me
around halfway into level 30, payed 100pp for a 90% rez, at level 30 i didnt
wanted to loose the XP.

If you want spider silk, the BEST place to get it is in Guk Heart Spider Cave.
Once in a while someone pop down there and tell me that EK is better, since the
spiders there can drop up to 8 at a time. But in guk they drop 0-4, there are 11
spiders in the camp, and if you are level 30+ they are all green, and you can pull
them individually. I hunted there at 22, but died a few times because at that
level you get 2-3 spiders at a time, and if any of them manage to run away when
they are almost dead, you get 3-6 more spiders on you.
But for 30+, its the BEST spot to get spider silk, and a GREAT PL spot for
warriors of 14-18. PLed a warrior that was almost 15 to level 19 in little over 3
hours. Normally i dont PL, but down there i use the same mana if i kill them
myself, or if a warrior kill them, and if i get the silk anyway i dont care.
