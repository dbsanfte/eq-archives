True, but I'm of the opinion that the economy is twinking to a lesser
degree.  If you get rid of one, you'll have to get rid of both.  Then again,
I'm not anti-twink, so I'd rather keep both around.

I'll take your word for it, since I wasn't in EQ back then.

Order of the Mallet

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
