Heh, wizards are *always* running OOM. I have a gnome wizzy with high
INT, and if I don't pace myself, I have the same problem. I figure
that if I can keep my mana level (%) no lower than half my MA's hp
level, I'm doing well. It's easy for things to get a little messy
though, and you wind up nuking everything in sight to try and diffuse
an overpull.

I started a human necro simply because I wanted a bit of a challenge
and I wanted a char you just don't see every time you turn around. I
don't regret it. Thinking about a human mage too...
