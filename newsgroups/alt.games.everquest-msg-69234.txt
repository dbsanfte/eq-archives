Maybe during fight with champion priest poped, and CH the champion from his
spawn. It can be tricky if you never been there, coz the priest heals from
his room though te wall.

54 shaman can solo champion easily, but if he was hit and he didnt know
where the CH came from (and maybe a room pop or two) he cant handle the
situation with ease. Now the big question is why didnt he zone to lava or
solA  ...
