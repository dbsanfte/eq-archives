Well you may be missing a lot by not having the expansions. It mostly
depends on what is important to you and how "addicted" to the game you
are. If you are REALLY into the game, you will eventually want all of
the expansions. Especially if you join a guild and want to hunt with
other members. The odds are they will want to go to a zone that you
need one of the expansions to play in. 

For pure convenience and less downtime due to traveling I highly
recommend the newest expansion Planes of Power.

Here is a short list of what you get with each expansion.

Kunark:
Adds Iksar (lizard) Race and all Kunark Zones. 
Allows you to level past 50 up to 60.
Contains some of the most popular mid-level zones (Lake of Ill Omen,
Overthere, Dreadlands)
Contains some of the most popular 50+ zones/dungeons (Karnors,
Chardok, Sebelis)

Velious: 
Adds 34-55+ content and zones.

Luclin:
Adds new player *models
Adds the Bazaar and Nexus (where almost all player trading/selling of
items occurs)
Adds Vah Shir (cat race) and BeastLord Class.
Adds the BEST 15-25 zone in the game (Paludal Caverns)

Planes of Power:
Adds a fantastic free/instant teleportation system to all major cities
as well as the Nexus/Bazaar (if you have Luclin) via the Plane of
Knowledge. This is a HUGE bonus to all players from level 1 to 65. It
makes travelling MUCH easier. The PoK also contains trainers and spell
vendors for all classes. All races/classes are welcome (indifferent
faction).

*In order to run the new Luclin character models smoothly you really
need at LEAST 512mb of system RAM, and a 64mb video card. 

The "cheapest" way to upgrade would be to pick up Everquest Gold. It
contains ALL expansions (including Planes of Power) and runs about
$69.99US at Compusa or Amazon.com. I know it looks expensive, but it
is cheaper than buying the expansions piece by piece (EQ:Trilogy
(contains Kunark and Velious)-roughly $30.00, Shadows of
Luclin-roughly $30.00, and Planes of Power-roughly $40.00). If you
started EQ 3+ years ago like I did you would have paid roughly
$180.00US (x2 or more if you have multiple accounts) buying the
original game and each expansion as soon as they were released.
