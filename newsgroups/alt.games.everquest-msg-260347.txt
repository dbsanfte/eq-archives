A flag is a character flag...  a mark placed on the character's record,
indicating that they have completed a specific event, whether single group
or raid, or sometimes just talking to the right NPC.  In the Planes of Power
expansion and Gates of Discord expansion, there are certain zones that you
cannot enter unless you have certain events completed, and the flags gained.
When you get one, usually (but not always) it tells you in yellow text "You
have received a character flag!"

It's like getting a key to a zone, only instead of showing up on your
keyring (/key), it shows up when you "meditate on your past experiences" at
the Seer in PoK.

> Also what does FD Monks mean?

FD is short for Feign Death.   It's the monk skill that allows them to
pretend to have died, so all of the monsters attacking them leave them alone
instead.
