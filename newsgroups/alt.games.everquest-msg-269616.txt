Before they Went Away (TM) I swore by 3dfx based cards. I even liked my 
Voodoo Rush, in a masocistic sort of way. Sure Windows locked up on the 
desktop a couple of times a day, but look at POD!
Before I got a Radeon, I swore AT nVidia based cards.

Right now I've got a non-ATI ATI card that was sold by the web store as 
an ATI made card... it is a piece of shit. X600XT, my old Radeon 9600pro 
  outperforms it in a machine running 2/3 the clock speed!
AMD Athlon XP 2400+ (2.0 ghz machine) + Radeon 9600 scores about 3300 on 
the main artificial benchmark I use.
Intel P4 3.4 ghz + x600XT scores about 3200

Now yes, the P4 runs software better... The artificial benchmark is 
designed to be almost not influenced by the processor. On HL 2, for 
example, I average about 30 more fps on the P4. But those results on the 
benchmark are pathetic compared to what an X600XT should do. It:
a) Doesn't have the thermal sensor for the auto overclocking.
b) has a cooler I would have thrown out and replaced on my 486dx4/100.
c) has slower ram
d) is running at a slower clock speed than the 9600, and when I bump it 
up any at all, it goes all 'bbq'ing processor artifacts' on me.

(I'd switch cards but the P4 doesn't have an AGP slot.. PCI-Express)
I think SantaPiggyBank is getting me a real ATI card for Christmas... I 
just have to get over my upgrade shock. (dropped close to $1500 on a 
full out brand new box month or two ago, then had to get the door hinges 
replaced on my truck... long story.).

We ordered a customer at work a pci express X800XT last month... I 
slipped it in my home machine to 'test' it.

oh that was sweetness.
