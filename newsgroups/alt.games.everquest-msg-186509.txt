There is more to the holistic world approach than adding more mobs.
Indeed the empty ramp in EK is actually an excellent example of
flavor, even if it is boring. In our theoretical holistic world
approach it is supposed to be boring!

You are locked into the EQ mindset, which is understandable. The
approach I am suggesting requires a more openminded approach to what
can work.

If I remember one of your other posts you came into EQ after it had
been out a while, but perhaps someone earlier can give their opinion:
when you first saw ads for EQ in magazines or something, and before
you had experience with UO, and ESPECIALLY if you had no experience
with proto-mmorpgs like M59 or MUDs, did you imagine what playing EQ
or UO be like?

I did. I imagined moseying on up to some cloaked stranger in a dark
corner of a seedy inn, making a trade for a component I needed to make
some magical item, all of it done in character on both sides

Haha! Think on that a moment. How naive was I, right? EQ characters
hanging around in taverns? Having in character motivations? Obviously
I had no idea what was coming, but I can't be blamed, this was pre-UO
release (or very soon afterwards, I was not really focused on watching
for games with online sources at the time). Almost no one did.

But wait. How naive was I, really? Could this game I imagined have
happened?

Probably not with EQ. The mindset is too alien. The game simply wasn't
set up to support that, in some ways due to the way it was played in
beta.

But impossible?

I don't think so.

And I don't think its wrong to try to make one, either, even if it
doesn't pander to EQ's powergaming crowd.
