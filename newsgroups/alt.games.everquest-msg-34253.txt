Sounds exciting, that will be a project for next weekend or so :)
takes a while to travel there and even longer when having some trouble
zoning out of kael and the game sends me to a safe spot, that was to
the left of the dragon bridge, takes like 15 minutes to hide/sneak
back to kael while hearing high level people shouting about death
squads to kael *horror*

Think even my chanter gets a enduring breath spell at lvl 12 or so, he
made lvl 8 last night so still a bit to go.
