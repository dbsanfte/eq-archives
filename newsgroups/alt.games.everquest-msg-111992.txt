Rofl, it's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.

I considered making a "%T is about to make me tank him again" macro for Kael
when I pull agro on purpose (whee, sunder+fixation+83 snare resists) but
then the cleric would have to make a new CH hotkey for me.

I also have a "%t is NOT snared" hotkey for when it gets down to near
running if I haven't landed snare yet (usually right after that hotkey gets
hit I try a root to keep it from running, which requires my "%t is ROOTED"
hotkey)

Then there's also my pulling hotkey (yeah, I probably should've been a
monk...) "%t is trying to eat me, make %s stop!!"

And the ninjaloot hotkey ("looting %t because I need the money") that I
haven't used since like level 28 when we had a ninja-bard in our group in
the FM giant fort, he took special pride on not letting anyone else loot.
Even with the hotkey I couldn't get past him, well, until we all left the
group and reformed without him (since he was the leader), at which point he
asked to rejoin and didn't loot a thing the rest of the night (though we did
let him roll on the cash items, he hadn't been ninjaing those, or at least
he gave them to whoever won the roll)
