Lots of money in JC too.  The items that can be crafted are great, I am 
currently wearing a full set of crafted tier 3 jewelry, as it's better 
than any dropped item I have found so far.  Fortunately, having someone 
in guild make the jewelry with the stuff I harvest means it costs little 
to nothing.  In exchange, I make items for the guild, and supply raw 
materials to most anyone that needs them.
