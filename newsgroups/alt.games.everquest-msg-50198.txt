Hit the road to Qyenos. Many good newbie quests there. (Use Allakhazam to
research them all. The first I can think of you can do now is Gnoll teeth)

What I did: Find those spiderlings and your city loom early. Use the silks
to make threads to get your first few tailoring levels, then find the
closest zone with Orc Pawns, which drop cloth armor frequently. (been a
LONG time since I last fought gnoll pups in Qyenos, not sure if they drop
it or not) Once you're outfitted, it's time to strip naked and hoof it to
the commons. Get a bind when you're there. (Many can bind now.. got a bind
the other day in BB, from an Erudin no less) It's a long dangerous run but
well worth it. The upside is you can stop off in HHK and grab your level 8
animation spell while you're on the way. Once bound in Freeport, you have
a veritable smorgasboard of newbie quests and more importantly, many many
mobs dropping tailoring supplies for your next 5 levels or so. By the time
you ding 8 you'll be fully decked out in raw silk, and should have enough
to get that Oh-so-important illusion Dark Elf so you can run the Stein of
Maggok quest.
