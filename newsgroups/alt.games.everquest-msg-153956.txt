I have just started a bard.I've  been warned that it is the ultimate class
as far as concentration and timing.I am just learning to twist 2 songs next
is 3songs but 4????Someone needs to make a foot pedal much like a piano foot
pedal with 4 pedals that will ,through programming on the client
side,intercept the keyboard numbers  so that a bard can twist with his or
her foot and still chat and move like the rest of us.What do you think?
