Last Hate raid I went on we had 30 people, and EVERYBODY came out
with something.  Armor, quest stuff, gems, you name it.  Gems dropped
off of almost EVERYTHING it seemed like.  We ended up randoming the
last few because EVERYBODY had already had one drop, and nobody
wanted to seem stingy by re-starting the rotation over :-).
