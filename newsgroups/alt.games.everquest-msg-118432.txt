Instead of the Foreman's Tunic, you might want to look at the Bloodstained
Tunic which drops off of An Undead Knight in Unrest. It's stats are 13 AC +4
AGI  +4 WIS. It's a rare drop, though. The knight is level 28. I was lucky
enough to meet a generous person who got the item for me at my current level
because I helped out his lower level alt, but at 30 you should be able to
get with a group.

The graphic is cool, too. I'll have to look into these other items in the
future. I have my wis up to 130 from 105. I'm trying to get it higher with
better rings/earrings, but I can never seem to find a jeweler.
