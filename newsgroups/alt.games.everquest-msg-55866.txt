Pffft, EQ is a perfectly acceptable replacement for a social life!
Except for the... ahem... *special* kind of social intercourse you
miss out on... RU A CHYK IRL? WANAN CYBER WIFF ME? doesn't count.

Dwarves? DWARVES?!? Ick, always quaffing their ale while they're burrowing
in their mines. Actually, I think I understand your reasoning: Good warrior
race, reasonably well-liked in most of the world, good newbie zone, and
night vision.

However, I'd suggest starting a halfling or gnome warrior, worse stats for
sure, but I like those newbie zones better. And none of those are night-
blind, either.

As someone else noted in some other post lost in the mists of my bad
short-term memory, Shadow Knights are listed as a Difficult class
primarily because of being hated by most NPCs. Having never played
one, here's my 2cp worth:

1 Shadow Knights make good tanks up until the end game, with good AC,
  good melee skills, and some great taunt spells.
  
2 They are always desired as pullers, since they can Invis and Feign

3 Shadow Knights are 25% Necromancer, 75% Warrior. They are the only
  caster hybrid to get a pet. The pet is rather weak, though, the SK
  has to tank for it, rather than the other way around.
  
4 SKs get a line (two lines?) of spells that steal life from their
  victims and give it to them. This means that they aren't as
  dependent on another class to heal them as other melee classes
  are. I don't know if these lifetap spells are good enough to
  accommodate effective soloing, though.

5 Many of the SK spells are Damage over Time spells. Depending on
  the situation, these spells can be a danger to you and your
  group (Feign Death doesn't work when the monster is DoTed, DoTs
  break enchanter Mesmerize series)
  
Due to point 2 and 5, I'd advise against starting out as a Shadow
Knight, puller classes should have some experience about the game,
and learning when to use what spells can take some time, too.

OR you could just keep playing that gnome warrior! GNOME POWER!

Sorry...

I believe SKs are reasonable soloers, certainly better than Warriors
or Rogues. I've never played one, but I never let that stop me from
advising others.

Hmm, no, can't agree here. The population on FV is very low at the
moment, and interacting with others not of your race is nigh on
impossible because of the language barrier. I can't recommend that
a true newbie starts there.

I have no wisdom, but love to rant about stuff I know nothing about!

Truer words were never spoken. Beggars go straight to my /ignore

I damn well drop whatever I'm doing, unless I'm on my way to a raid,
if I hear words to that effect. Helping a real newbie makes me remember
the days when the game was new to me, and is fun to boot!

No but you are! PLONK! Hitler! The nazis! You and Bizbee are in a
cabal to control this newsgroup! VAK! You petitioned my Monk, Lo Hung!
People who inspect are rude! They nerfed druids again! And don't you
dare reply until you read the next 10 rambling posts I plan on posting
to this thread sometime in the future!
