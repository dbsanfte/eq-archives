Absolutely! I actually do this with most products, I'll reach into the pile 
and pick one that's 3 or 4 back, to be sure I'm not getting the one that 
everyone has thumbed through before.

Oh, I'm very careful to preserve the goodies on the front seat, no ripping 
apart boxes. Hell, I even peel back that lame circular seal from the bottom 
of the box so that if it tears off some box paper it comes off the bottom 
instead of the top. We have to maintain the integrity of our game boxes ...
