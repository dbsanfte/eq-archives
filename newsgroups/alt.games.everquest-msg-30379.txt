May i jump in and ask how often this nice little dragon spawns?
i traveled there and got the key and saw no trace of him.

And another one on faction here, the town down in CC how would
they consider me if i have killed nothing in SoV, well except two
snowbunnies, and as a rogue how do i trade with them if they are
hostile or plain refuse to trade?
