Taunt puts you one point over everyone else on the hate list.  When you're
young and still working the skill, you'll want to push it every time it pops
to get your skill up. In actual use, you'll save it til you need it.   If
you push it all the time, when someone gets aggro you'll have to wait for it
to pop again before you can taunt the mob off the other person.
