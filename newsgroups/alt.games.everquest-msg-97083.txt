I think that will be better for getting ready for 51.  As it is
now, 50 is one of the easiest levels for some classes. With a 
smooth xp curve, it should have the highest pre-51 xp cost.

Lol - yeah, but did you get to 50 with a double death penalty
and a 40% hybrid xp penalty.  (no, I didn't - I got to my late
20's with a bard with these handicaps.)  When a Dragoon Dirk
was worth 100pp and was a GREAT bard weapon.  Now I can't sell
a BALS (9/29) weapon for 100pp in EC.

The no CR before 10th does bother me a little.  True newbies
will never know the fun of running through EC yelling "naked
bard on CR - DON'T LOOK!"  Back before I knew what corpse
dragging was, and would loot a couple items, then have to bail
for the zone when a kitty jumped me (before right clicking an
item equipped it, mind you).  I'm not being sarcastic here, there
is some fun to be had in early CR's.
