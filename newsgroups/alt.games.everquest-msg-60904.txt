Begin killing Halflings in Nektulos. Good experience at your level, and it
will raise your standing with DreadGuard Outer, DreadGuardInner, and
IndigoBrotherhood if I'm not mistaken.

BUT, have a partner or two as they spawn in camps and don't wander, and for
Thule's sake watch out for the Leatherfoot Medic, who is low 20's and
wanders between the three halfling camps in the forest.

Do this until you are indifferent or higher with the city guards, and then
you *should* be able to start doing the wine quest in 3rd Gate. Avoid the
guildhalls, though.

This will be somewhat difficult and awfully tedious, but at the end you'll
have one city on Antonica which you can be relatively safe in.
