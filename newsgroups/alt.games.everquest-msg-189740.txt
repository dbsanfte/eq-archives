Yes that's quite nice.  I still think a compromize would be best. 
Random dungeons aren't all that fun.  They should make it so like you
could "do" sebilis with a group, where you get a mission like you would
in AO, then you go to a static dungeon but you and your group only enter
one copy of it (and other groups can enter another copy), you can then
clean it out (with no respawns), or just get your objective (say
trakanon) then delete your mission, or give up on it and delete your
mission.

That way you still have the content of EQ, and yet completely eliminate
camping something & waiting for respawns.

I'll have to read up on it some more.  I can see perma-death as an
option for an "Ironman" server or some such, but I think that would make
it really unpopular.  If they make it permadeath in the game as a whole
I think they would loose a good 90% of the customers.

Wonder if you can play a storm trooper.  I think I'll have to go read
the FAQ again and see what they've been doing recently.

The actual last straw for me was a bug that messed up my stats.  I had
got my character up to a respectable spellcaster with 98 Int, then one
day I got an increase which set all my stats back to starting.  There
wasn't anythign they'd do about it.  

EQ is treading this fine line with me as well (acutally crossed it).  I
quit for 6 months after a repeated bug that when I was rezed (which
playing an enchanter was a couple times a day) Some things would
dissapear out of my inventory occasionally.  I lost what was over 20k
worth of items which they never did get back to me, and at the time that
was probably worth almost as much as all my other items put togeather. 
Most of the stuff I lost they got back to me, but all it took was one
bad one where it got my most expensive items.  I must have lost my
chetari wardstaff 5 times...

As soon there is something better out there I'm jumping boat.  That's
one more reason I'm not looking forward to SGW very much, since it's
going to be the same company, I think I can expect the same level of
customer (un)support.
