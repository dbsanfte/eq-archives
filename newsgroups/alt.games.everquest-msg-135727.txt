Really?  Why don't you show us, then, exactly where he said he had no 
problems with people with victim's mentalities being victimized?  All I 
see is where he said 'to match your victim mentality'.  It may suprise you

}Don't blame me when your own words show you for what you are..

He's not, he's blaming you for misquoting him.
