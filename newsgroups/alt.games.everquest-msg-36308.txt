Odd. I've played several experimental warriors, SKs, PALs, and RNGs, I
currently have "mains" that are an SK (15) and RNG (21). None of their
taunt skills budged if I didn't drop a point in. My roommate played a
warrior to 10 before putting a point into taunt, constantly hitting
taunt, and it never raised.

Think you need to double check your facts there.
