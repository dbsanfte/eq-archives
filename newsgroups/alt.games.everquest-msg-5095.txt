Pathing controls the route the mobs take when they follow you back to
your group. In the wide-open oudoor zones, it's generally just a
straight line, but indoors and in confined spaces it gets pretty
strange.

For example, in mistmoore, when you pull mobs up the ramp by the zone.
When you step on the ramp, the mobs run away a bit and then back
towards you. If you don't know about this, you can end up getting a
roaming mob besides the ones you wanted to pull.

Near the rear of the ground floor of the building in unrest is a room
whose mobs will aggro pretty much the whole house. The room across the
hall is easy to pull, but this one leads to big trains. I never did
figure out how to pull this room without one.

There are also areas with pathing bugs that can be exploited for easy
xp. I've heard bartender in SoL A is one, there's also a place in
Xorbb's Gorge where you can do it. In these places by taking a step or
two one way or another, you cause the mob to take a widely circuitous
route to get back to you. You can snare and DoT the mob and step back
and forth while it runs around dying. You can be banned for this, I
think.

A bit long maybe, but that's what pathing is. :)
