This thread has morphed into more than my original point.  The point is HP
regeneration for the Warrior sucks.  And HP are our lifeblood.  Carrying
backpacks full of bandages becomes impractical.  If the Warrior has grown up
to be a slicing and dicing killing machine then why in the hell cannot he or
she regain their HPs faster than any other class in the game?

And while I am on this rant I will throw in another tangent.  Disarm is a
horribly unreliable ability that rarely works.  How would a caster like it
if his spells worked only 10% of the time?  Disarm needs to be improved so a
warrior can land it more often.  It is a cool ability when it works.
