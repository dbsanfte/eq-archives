This sounds kind of dumb, but another thing you could do if you have
an extra character slot is make a shaman or mage and level the shaman
up to level 5 (when they get Spirit Pouch, the 100% WR bags) or the
mage to level 8 (when they get their WR bag spell), take your cleric
to some out of the way place, log on your shaman/mage to make the WR
bags and drop them on the ground, then log on your cleric to pick up
the bags (they should still be there if you log on within 30 minutes,
and I doubt anyone would be really itching to steal them anyways).  

Also, going off track a bit, if you have a character that wants to
kill willowisps but you don't have a magic weapon, or you play a pet
class but your pet isn't high enough level to hit magic-only mobs (for
example, only level 15+ BL pets can hit magic-only mobs) you can also
make a dummy mage, get the Summon Dagger spell (level 1 spell that
summons a dagger that's a magic weapon), log on your mage to summon
the daggers, drop them on the ground, then log on your other
character.  Then you'll have magic weapons you can either use yourself
or give to your pet.

(many of you probably already know this by now but thought it was
still sort of worth mentioning!)
