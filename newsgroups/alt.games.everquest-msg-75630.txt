You have to be HOLDING the instrument...like you would a weapon.  It goes in
your secondary melee slot.  Also, take a look at the flute...perhaps it's
not actually a bard instrument.  If it's an instrument maybe it's not wind.

Did they change it that you get instrument skill increases even if you're
not holding an instrument?
