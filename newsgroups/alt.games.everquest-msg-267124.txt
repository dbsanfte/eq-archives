    My guild seems to have been decimated, with perhaps 40% missing from the
last two raids. MOST of the people I ordinarily play with are in EQ2 or the
WoW open beta. Povar had much lower than normal bazaar numbers last I
looked, and PoK seemed (very subjective) down too. This is the worst it's
been since that series of DX9 bugs and Gates's quality release brought
numbers to a huge low a few months ago, and it may even be worse than that.

    The difference this time is that I see no reason to expect these players
to return, or for newbies to replace them.
