From that list... I'd upgrade in the following order...

Processor... prolly need a new MBoard tho... look for 1Gig (upto 1.7/1.8...
any higher is wasting money right now)

Memory... 512Meg is the magic number here... PIII 450 might mean you're
running Win98, so don't go above 512Mb unless you want to upgrade your OS as
well... if you're using XP/ME/2000 you should be okay with more if you can
afford it. This is the cheapest upgrade at the moment... but there are
rumours that prices are going up again in 2nd Quarter.

Video card... won't recommend anything in particular (my asbestos suit is at
the cleaners) but look to spend �100-�160 ($140 - $220 US)

Of course... if you've got money to burn... go for all the bells and
whistles you can get...

... and buy another set of the same and ship it over to ME! ;o)
