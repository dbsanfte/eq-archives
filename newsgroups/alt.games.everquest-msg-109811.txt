In the end, it comes down to these things for me:

1) I hate rotting armor

2) Localized banks, while realistic, are a paint in the ass.  IOW, not fun

3) Houses?  Eh, who cares.  More money sinks that I'll never be able to 
save to sink into anyway. 

I'm no likely to play eq2.  When I leave EQ1 it will be for some other 
game entirely, or to catch up on all the lost reading time from the last 3 
years.
