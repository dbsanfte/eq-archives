Not really.  Prices for characters will never be what they used to be.  The
game has lost its spark.  I am sure that this post wil be flamed by some who
think I am clueless and have no idea what I am talking about but I remember
the game when Kunark came out and then Velious.  The game has made it UBERLY
easy for a character to race through levels 1-40.  Getting to 50 is not
really a problem if you can keep from getting too bored.  Then you hit your
low 50s and realize how screwed up the balancing is in the game.

There are so many new games on the horizon that few people are willing to
pay decent money for characters anymore.  And it is my opinion that the game
has suffered since SONY took full control and disbanded Verant.
