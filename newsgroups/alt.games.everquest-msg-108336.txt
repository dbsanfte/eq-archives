Talendor, yes; Sev, yes; Gore, yes; Faydedar on the other hand, I've never
encountered personally, I believe the spawned version for the druid epic is
kos though I'm not sure about the 'real' fishy.

I think that default RoS faction has to do with your deity, good and neutral

about evils (Rallos zek is considered neutral, or else evils are ok by
default also).
