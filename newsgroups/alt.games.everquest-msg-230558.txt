I want to start a guild on tunare or any server where everyone tries to help
others, lvl, get items and have fun.  I have been in other guilds and they
only really hunt with friends they know or a class which is in high demand.
If anyone out there is interested in starting a guild with me on tunare or
newbie guild on another server plz email me.
