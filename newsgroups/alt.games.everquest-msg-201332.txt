Sorry to piggyback, I missed the original.

I think you got it backwards, Ed. The fact that Bards can twist songs is 
basically a bug that got out of hand, and Sony simply let it be as part 
of what defines bards... There never was any design involved, it works, 
rather, at the sufferance of the designers.

If Sony wanted to make playing Bards easier, it wouldn't take any more 
than implementing a "repeat" command for macros, but I think it's 
correct that the extreme dexterity and endurance required to play a Bard 
constitute the limiting factor (or else everybody would be a Bard). If 
that factor were taken away Bards would require *massive* nerfage to 
compensate
