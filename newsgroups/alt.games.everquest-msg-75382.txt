Try the Avaik city in SK. No aggro and faction probelms with the avaiks.  If
around city is full there is a bird house near the city that has 3 steady
pops. You should be able to handle Egerts and Darters easy in the mid 20's.
Zone to the south if you need to bail.  If you do solo alot I'm sure you
know to scout the area.  Once you get to 30 you should able to handle spire
one near split paw.  Infected paw is the closet zone for bailout.  Once you
hit 35 Solo the bedroom in Infected paw.  If camped you can run around
hunting avocets and such throughout the zone.  Only true threats in zone are
undead and regular cyclops. Closets bind point is gypsy camp in NK.
