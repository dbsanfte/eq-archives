1. The BB camp dungeon has a lot of undead, making it the favored location
for Clerics, Paladins, Necromancers, and Shadow Knights.
2. There are a lot of good items that can be bought with adventure pts at
the BB camp.

On the Rathe, BB is the most popular. No one seems to do South Ro
adventures. Don't know if its because the loot is crappy or because the
other dungeons offer better items for the adventuring points.

Whenever I go to North Ro, there seems to be only lvl 65s around. Most of
the time I've done North Ro groups, the group formed at the BB camp then
took the Magus to North Ro.

For the record, I prefer Tak (I'm a Magician), then MMC, but I've done more
MMC missions than Tak missions. Miragul's I only go to if I have to, as I've
had the most failures there (bad pulls, leading to mega-trains. Seems its
easiest to get trains there), and I can't think of anything you can buy with
points from there that I can't do without for now. (Not high level enough to
get a Delightful Orb Of Forgotten Magic from Miragul's, but I already have
one, anyway)
