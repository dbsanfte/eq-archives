Hiya,

you ll always experience this on patchdays. While uberguilds can get on 
their chars a few minutes after patchend you ll sit there and will get 
1001 and 0023-errors. Dont ask me why ... EQIM is working and you so can 
see who is online sigh...

But time will come and we all will be able to play again ... there are 
other things to do in RL too =)

So have fun and good luck with getting on later

Christian
