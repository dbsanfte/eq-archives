    Did, past tense. And yes, we'd bring two charmed Corrupted Knights (275
DPS each) and pound Paffa into paste in under a minute. Wipes only happened
when both pets broke charm - Paffa just can't chew through the 20 K HPs of a
Corrupted Knight faster than CH can restore those HPs. Since the charm nerf,
we haven't bothered because we know charm will drop too many times for it to
be worth the effort. Besides, the necromancers have a new spot where they
get an AA every 30 minutes without charm.

    It's a great earring, a real step up from whatever the priest used to
have in his non-Solstice ear slot (usually a Chardok earring, or perhaps a
Silver Hammer one).

    I hate to disappoint you, but it really is the only worthwhile dungeon
zone in PoP, period. With one exception, the other indoor zones in PoP have
too much space in them to feel like dungeons. You can kite stuff in them
with all the room! The one exception is Sol Ro's tower. But the initial
spawn densities in most of the wings is clearly designed to bog down a
raid-sized force. Single groups will spend far too much time working out
crowd control and pull control to really do any crawling. Which is too bad -
there's a lot of neat mob models used there, there's a variety of
environments, and the droppable loot on the mini-nameds really is pretty
high quality (eg. 65 HP/MANA caster necklace with solid stats).

    Oh, PoWater doesn't have much room to move, either. But it's in water,
so it automatically sucks hard.
