i wasn't being sarcastic - but i'm actually responding to show you this:

taken from http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/g/Godwin_s_Law.html

Godwin's Law     prov.     [Usenet] "As a Usenet discussion grows longer,
the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one."
There is a tradition in many groups that, once this occurs, that thread is
over, and whoever mentioned the Nazis has automatically lost whatever
argument was in progress. Godwin's Law thus practically guarantees the
existence of an upper bound on thread length in those groups. However there
is also a widely- recognized codicil that any intentional triggering of
Godwin's Law in order to invoke its thread-ending effects will be
unsuccessful.


and i'm not one-upping you, or being sarcastic......i just think the jargon
dictionary is just the consummate guide to usenet

also, if you said you assumed that i wasn't being sarcastic, then you would
take me at face value for saying "it's spelled out so clearly" - which it
is, in fact, so were you assuming i was conjuring up some coincidence?
wierd! i am actually kind of a mental midget for knowing only half of the
law

live and learn

what's quite ironic is that my initial toe-in to this thread was almost an
exact copy of the quirk business

double live and learn !
