Yes that's a safe room, but there are indeed a few things which
"move" in Befallen, namely Gynok and his placeholders.

Left alive, they will wander from their spawn point, down
to the second floor, back up to their spawn point again,
then down to the third floor, then back up to their
spawn point *again*, then finally back down to the middle
of the third floor where they'll stand until they despawn.
