BIG Problem with my computer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Okay, been having this problem for MONTHS now and have yet to find a
solution.

Here is what happens:

1. My lag bar starts racing at a crazy speed and the last number jumps above
2500 and all the way up to 6500 sometimes. The rest of the numbers stay
steady, 215 ping or so and 0% on both the middle sides.

2. EVERYTHING I do is delayed by anywhere from 5 seconds to a minute or more
(when it gets that bad, I normally get too frustrated and leave, so it could
get delayed even higher). This includes casting spells (click gem 20 seconds
later, "You begin casting X" and from there), group says, regular says,
tells, where I am currently (I'll move away from a mob and it will still be
hitting me as if I haven't moved yet), etc.

3. I DO NOT get video lag, slow mouse movement, anything. And everyone else
in the game appears to be moving normally. I see all tells as they are sent
(from my own best judgment that is) and attack messages as I see someone
attacking, etc. The rest of the game (what is left at least) appears to work
just fine.

4. It happens mostly in zones with a decent number of people and especially
in raid type situations (like tonight) though I have had the problem in City
of Mist where I was with two friends and we had the zone to ourselves and
other hardly packed places. Doesn't tend to happen in non-combat zones
though.

------------------------------

My Machine:
Athlon 1800XP
512 MB DDRAM
GeForce 3Ti500 with 32 MB Video RAM
SoundBlaster Audigy Platinum Soundcard
Cable Modem (Surfboard 3100) connected to a NIC card
Two 60GB Hard Drives with EQ and XP and all normal programs installed on
main drive and media files on second drive
No Modem installed in the computer
No Peer to peer network, hub, firewall, etc

Running Windows XP Home Edition on a single computer (no network)

------------------------------

What I have tried:

1. Running at lowest settings possible, all new models turned off, Low
Detail, all spell effects gone, all filters except group gone, serverside
filter ON. Only thing I haven't lowered is the screen resolution since I
can't play if my boxes cram my view (I run at 1280x1024 which my monitor
supports).

2. Formatting my machine and reinstalling everything using the backups of
character INI files and settings INI.

3. Scandisk and Defrag complete of both of my hard drives.

4. Running Ad-Aware from LavaSoft to remove all adware programs from my
computer.

5. Cleaning Internet Cache and every single Temp file on the computer (they
store those WAY too many different places).

6. Running the game without WinAMP (which if that had been the solution, I
would probably quit EQ because I can't live without my music).

7. Called EQ Tech Support and they said it sounded like a connection
problem. Called my ISP and they can detect nothing wrong from their end, all
the way up the chain of servers (researched by some higher level tech
support people and everything)

8. Reseated every bit of hardware in my machine and completely cleaned the
whole thing out including the heat sinks under the fan over the chip.

9. I run EQ with no programs in the background, no firewall, no virus
detection, etc except normally WinAMP but I tried without that as well (see
number 6 above).

10. Playing with the Datarate file, every single number between 1-9

--------------------------

Not sure how to check if I have an IRQ sharing issue since they aren't
listed in XP where they were in 98 (sometimes really hate this operating
system)

--------------------------

ANY ideas on this would be greatly appreciated. I have yet to hear of anyone
else having this problem and I've looked around on a few message boards
(though it is a hard problem to do a search for).
