The question was if you need it for a Pick Up Group...with my normal group,
it's not necessary.  Do you really want to group with a bunch of possibly
over pulling strangers without a KEI?

I personally don't do PUGs, but to address the question that was
asked...typically you want to have KEI when doing a pick up group.  It
doesn't matter how good you are at mana management.  The fact is, in a PUG,
you are grouping with people that you are not used to playing with.  They
are also not used to playing with you, therefore they have no idea of your
mana pool, casting style, etc.  Unless you have Ben's infinate mana pool,
this means that they will most likely be running you low to out of mana.  So
yes, get a KEI.
