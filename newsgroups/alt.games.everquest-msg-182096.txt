Richard, you just saved me the time of answering James' question(s) to
me, so thanks. And yes, I saw the response. 

James, as you pointed out, you're not an officer in LC, so I don't think
anyone here is holding you *personally* accountable for all this crap.
As to the end results, there is also no issue of "who has what" except
for possibly the loot from one kill needing to be given to your guild.

You ask "what part of it" is a problem? The only thing that's been a
problem here, right from the beginning, was the attitude and response
from LC after another alliance teamed up and beat RZtW. The whole
disdainful, boohooist act. A lot of what you've written seems centered
on how much of a nice bunch of guys you want to be see as, and how
important your repuation is to you. But LC certainly has no problem
immediately (and *very* publicly, this is now all over a ton of boards)
trashing the rep of several other guilds if they don't do things by the
letter according to LC's marching orders.

Not really a shining moment for your guild, and kind of sad. The others
found a way to beat the mob and get the flags. Be happy for them.
