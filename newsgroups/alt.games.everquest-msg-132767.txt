}Never had any of my guildies ever turn their noses up at my crappy
}PoN.  Close enough to cleric AC/HP buff, and it has that handy regen
}thing.

And it -stacks- mith my crappy chanter shield buff.  Woot!

}>Would it suprise you so much
}>to find out that magicians, clerics , and enchanters all have nukes that are
}>comparable over a 2 minute spread?
}Druids.  Moonfire 1150.  6.2 cast, 2.5 recast.  One cast every 8.7
}seconds.
}According to Casters Realm, enchanters don't get any normal nukes
}after 54 (Dementia), except for an Ancient spell (Ancient: Chaotic
}Visions).  Just for shits and giggles, lets use the ancient spell.
}775 damage.  6 second cast, 8 second recast.  One cast every 14
}seconds.  FYI, the 54 nuke Dementia does 675 damage, 6 second cast, 8
}second recast).

Ahh, I knew I had a math error!  Forgot that the recast time doesn't start 
until -after- the casting time.  Ok, so in order to get my max damage, I'd 
have to mem all 3 nukes and cycle them, So at ten nukes a minute I'd have 
max dpm = 10*(2*675/3+775/3) = 7083. :)  Ooh, I want the ancient nuke... 
:) Again, though, that's 2500 mana a minute, and at level 60 with 255 int, 
that's nearly a full bar...  And throw in some spell haste and spell 
damage, and ooh. :)  Of course, realistically, I will probably never mem 
more than two nukes.

}Hmmm.  Clerics get Judgement at 56.  925 damage with a 4 second cast
}time (nice) and a 9.5 second recast time.  One cast every 14.5
}seconds.  
}Mages might actually have druids beat on nuking here.  Lets see.  At
}60 they have Shock of Fiery Blades.  1005 damage 6.8 cast and an
}INSTANT recast.  So, one cast every 6.8 seconds.
}So, over two minutes (120 seconds) a druid will be able to nuke 13
}times for a grand total of 14950 points of damage.  Enchanters should
}be able to nuke 8 times in two minutes for a whopping 6200 points of
}damage.  Clerics get 8 bombs too for 7400 damage.  Mages do however
}come out on top with 17 nukes in two minutes for 17085 total damage.

Will these guys benefit from cycling multiple nukes as well?  It's my 
handy trick for ignoring recast times, and for enc it works very well, 
since we have multiple high-damage nukes with similar properties.  I'm not 
nearly as familiar with the other class' spells though.

}Necro's are solo gods (and good for them).  They piss and druids solo
}ability from a great, great height.  No argument there.  The bring
}somewhat less to a group though, although not as little as many think.

I've met plenty of necros that are awesome in groups.  I've also met 
plenty of necros who have absolutely no clue how to be useful in a group.  
But I certainly would not say that they are in any way restricted to 
soloing.
