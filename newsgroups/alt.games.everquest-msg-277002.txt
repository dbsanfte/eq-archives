My highest toon is 14. But I'll answer anyway.

1) finding out that the small rodents in Freeport town are tougher
than the rats in Glooming deep. Well, if you don't watch the health
bar.

2) Fippy and The Skeleton outside Qeynos. Now both a green to most
of my toons, I still stop by and kill them from time to time. The
Skeleton attacked when all I was doing was dealing with a fire
beatle. At first I thought it was just another decaying skeleton and
didn't run soon enough.

3) working my fingers to pain levels outside Freeport, with my first
toon, and someone suddenly offering me 50pp. Said not to worry about
paying it back, he took it out of petty cash.

4) While I hate click-by invites, I have more than once gotten into
pok, and suddely found my toon healed up and temperance added in. I
thanked the person doing it.

5)good advice is always a good thing. I'm still amazed though when
someone of the same class and race, with less than10 levels above my
toon, being unable to answer questions about the next levels. Like
where is the loom in Kelethin. Turned out to be a change... use a
sewing kit now.

Overall, I like EQ 1. But I have noticed that some character
classes, like druids, don't seem to have up todate info on player
web sites out there. Makes for a frustrating experience.
