Here are assorted guild name ideas I've had over the years.

1. (This is best for a guild heavy on Monks or Beastlords) "Knights of
Onan".  Guild motto is "In Battle As In Love--With Our Hands!".

2. "West Freeport Wine Tasting Society".

3. "Lake Rathe Yacht Club".

4. "Idiosyncratic Routine".

5. "Norrath First!" (for a guild of radical Druids and Rangers).

6. "The Runecarvers" (needs a guild song, which should be a parody of the
Stonecutters song from The Simpsons).

7. "Club Med" (for a guild with mostly casters).

8. "Elves in Denial"

9. "Ak'anon Varsity Basketball Team"

10. "Still Not Kings"
