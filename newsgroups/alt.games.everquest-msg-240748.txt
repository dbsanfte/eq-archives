Ok first off there ARE multiple commander spawns, the place holder for
a commander is another commander and they ARE insta pop.

Try playing in someplace that isn't seriously over camped (bb is WAY
over camped) and you will see what I mean.

I was in Feerrott last night, and there is a place near the entrance
to the plane of fear where 2 commanders will spawn, they are not
within a social aggro radius of eachother, but if you pass between
them, they will both aggro.

Stop as soon as you see them, pull them too ya and whack 'em to
bonechips.  If you are near where they spawned, you will see them
spawn again in the time it takes you to loot them.

Commanders spawn all night long, and have a timer of around 30s-1min
from the time the last one died, it takes about 3-4 minutes to kill
them.  I took out a total of 15 waves (30 commanders) before one
decided to HT my pet, and then his buddy came by and HT'd me, so be
careful..

In BB the commanders actually don't respawn in quite the same places. 
And I noticed an easter egg as they spawn in that zone.
If you happen to make a mark on your map of each spawn point and then
draw a line from commander a, to commander b etc... You will notice
that it makes an upside down 5 pointed star (the symbol of the devil
for reason), covering that one section of BB where they do spawn.

In QH the commanders all seem to spawn in one of 2 locations, both
only a short jog from the merchants in QH.  If you happen to run up
that path and see one commander engaged, just run to the other side of
the road, and within a minute or so of that one dying, the other
commander will pop on the opposite side of the road.
