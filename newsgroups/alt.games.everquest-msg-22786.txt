This (and not being able to alt-tab easily out) was deliberate. It
dissuades casual hackers.

Lots of people complain but I'd rather take the very small
inconvenience of not being able to check mail while playing in return
for eliminating some (of course not all) hacks.

Interestingly DAoC has decided to eliminate alt-tabbing out as well.
Despite a loud minority the benefit of making hacking harder is
considered greater than the convenience of checking email.

Besides people pay little enough attention in groups sometimes as it
is. :-p
