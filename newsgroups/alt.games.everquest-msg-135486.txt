Holy shit guys, talk about a mountain out of a molehill.

Referring SOLELY to DT's reply to the OP (before the slanging match),
I don't think it was rude or patronising.  The gist of it was that
there wasn't too much likelihood of many resources widely available
just now as the patch was relatively new, and that he should wait for
a while.  There.  Nothing rude about that IMHO.

Granted there was no real information in the post, and in terms of
signal-to-noise ratio perhaps it need have not been posted, but I
don't think anything in it could have prompted Carolan to wail on him
like that, which opened the floodgates to the subsquent torrents of
bile that followed.

Just my two coppers...

Tzen.
