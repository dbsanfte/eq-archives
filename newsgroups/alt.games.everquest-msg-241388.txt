I wouldn't say it's punishment, it's just doesn't fit the
requirements.  The requirements for leadership points should be
leading a group well enough to earn expereince.  Coordination of
different people, not just your own keyboards and hot keys.

Not that there aren't 2 person groups with 2 distinct people, just
that there's no way for SOE to know who's who so they just make a
requirement of 3.

A 2 person group could, but SOE made the decision to try and even the
playing field for people without 2 box capabilities.
