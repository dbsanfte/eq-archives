I don't have it yet, but Jaundiced Bone is what I am told I should be
looking for, rather than bother with Totemic.  I have a few pieces of the
Totemic armor, they were better than what I had before, but I have no plans
on getting all of it.  I would like the helm, but that Glacier Bear pelt is
supposed to be a real bitch to get.
