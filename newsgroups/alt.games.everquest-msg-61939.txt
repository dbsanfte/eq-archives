 Before you get the Klipsch look into Monsoon speakers.  Better
sound and price should be similar (not sure what you call cheap for
the Klipsch).  ProMedia's I listened to all had a problem in the
volume pot (this was in 2 different systems and also read one
reviewer that had same trouble).  Making a crackle sound when you
turn volume up or down.

The bad thing about the Monsoons is the little stands for desk
mounting aren't that great.  I got 2 good ones out of 4.  That was
enough for me since I bought the floor stands for my rear speakers.
Both of them are well made.

Just my .02 for what it is worth.
