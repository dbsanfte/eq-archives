Fully agree but a bad idea. First for people who require goods for skills
and secondly and probably more importantly EQ needs the maximum amount of
players for SOE to keep it going at such a good level - what would surely be
a better idea is vary the servers so that the "irritating slages" can power
level to there hearts content on one server with huge spawn rates and next
to no drops and the rest can use servers with lower spawn rates but good
drops. The list is endless of alterations that you could make but penalising
directly would cause players to simply play something else then EQ may not
exist.....
