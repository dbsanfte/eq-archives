My main is a beastlord.  I like playing him a lot since beastlord can
solo pretty well.  The assortment of healing spells, kitty crack, and
paragon of spirit help cuts the down time and if I get in a bad
situation I leave my pet behind to hold up the mobs while I flee.
Slow spell helps with the stronger mobs too =)   I usually fight as
tank and not let pet tank while playing pet cleric, it's just too slow
imo.

Most soloing classes don't have slow and if they get in a bad
situation they would get hurt a lot more before they could flee.  A
well geared shaman is probably the only class that can keep up with
beastlord in soloing without letting pet tank.

Fully buffed I can get to 13k hp and have sustained 250 dps output
plus pet dps. Toss in couple aa's plus disc and I can get 1k+ burst
dps.  I have a hotkey set to use frenzy aa, rake disc, and kick in one
key. (see beastlord forum for more on this).  When both aa and disc
fires, I've had crit in excess of 1500 damage.  

Add in a total of 4 lifetaps I have on weapon (Death's Maw Dagger, 2x
DoN augs, and 1 vampiric aug) plus maxed AA for healing affiny,
healing gift, and WA5 and quite often I go for a long time in 50's to
mid 60's zone without needing a single heal spell.

I used to have a little money making on the side while waiting for a
group, there's a bunch of spiders in PoN, along the south end of the
zone just east of the river.  Nightmare arachnid silk sells for about
2k in Maelin bazaar and I've gotten as many as 30 per hour so that's
60k per hour.  While a few are 65+, most are under 65 and I have
lasted vs 4 spiders at once without breaking a sweat.

I have tried some other classes (all at level 70) and none really
comes close to my play style.  SK is close but unless it's decently
geared and has the right AA, there'd be some downtime and SK has
useless boney pet that won't last one round with 65+ mobs. Pally are
OK but like SK, they can't really solo for long without needing
outside helps and pally don't have any pet.  Shaman can do OK but they
don't have its own hp/mana regen spell and may suffer some downtime
while fighting level 65 mobs.  Caster classes are too mana dependent
and would have major downtimes without C6 and kitty crack.
