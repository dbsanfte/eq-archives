I'm finally happy enough with this to show it with the community who knows
who this guy is. :)  This was my gift to Richard, to thank him for the
many many wonderful recounts and stories he's shared with us about Monual.

The usual disclaimers about referrer blocking and firewalls hiding headers
apply here, namely that if you have those, you won't be able to see
images at my webpage.

(The normal version in my gallery is watermarked, but I figure I can trust
this group to not rip off Monual's picture.  That'd just be tacky.
^_^ )
