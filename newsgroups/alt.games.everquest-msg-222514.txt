And if you set your goals low enough you can be sure you'll always be 
able to leave :) ?

Sure... you can farm pelts and sell them in the bazaar, and level and 
gear up that way, never joining a group, or being commited to anything.

But then you haven't really seen very much of the game either. And 
unfortunately, if you want to 'explore' as much as possible, kill as 
much as possible, or get the best loot... you will need to make friends, 
and commitments to to gain access to most of the game.

If all you want is a fancy chatroom with some resource management... eq 
will do that... but its like playing 'need for speed' and driving the 
speed limit. Your deliberately choosing to ignore most of the gameplay.

To each their own. And I have days where this is exactly what i do 
too... but sometimes i want to 'do something'... and that something 
usually takes time and friends... and that takes a commitment.
