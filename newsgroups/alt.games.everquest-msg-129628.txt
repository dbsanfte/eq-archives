I'm not sure where you're going with this, but what you say here is true.  I
will point out a few significant points, though.  No one blamed the British
for killing the young men who took up arms against them, no matter what the
age.  If you chose to fight, then you accepted the risk.

Also, you seem to acknowledge that Isreal and Palestine are at war.  You
should view Isreals actions through that lense, then.  Viewed that way,
Isreal hasn't done enough to end the Palestine threat.
