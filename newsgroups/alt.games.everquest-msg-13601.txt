Yes CoH is supposed clear agro, that is one of the uses for the spell. But
it cost a lot of mana and has a somewhat long recast time.

The z axis thing is this, the mob reads your loc as an xy coordinate, so if
you are at loc positive200, negative 327 and that is in the mobs dmg radius
then it won't summon you. The mob does not use the z coordinate. This is
Verant's fault it would not be that diffulcult to correct but there is no
reason to correct it as the mobs can hit you even if you are way above or
below them (think about it, ever been in Hate and have your clerics agro
from the mobs upstairs? so all your clerics have to camp out to clear
agro??)

As far as using an exploit... don't know anyone that hasn't used one whether
it be watching the pathing on creatures so you know where you can safely med
up, to bind wounds to 50% then taking off all hp gear and bind up to 50%
again then when hp gear is equipped you are at 75 -90 percent health, those
are low level exploits that are commonly used and using the fact that being
under rezz effects prevent slow spell from stacking or AE to not work is the
same type exploit just at a higher level in the game.
Basically, I am not saying that what CQ did was right or wrong that isn't
the point imho, the point is that they had the guild disbanded without a
warning first, they had accounts suspended again without warning. The GM and
other powers that be did not reveiw log files they just made a decision that
has EQers everywhere wondering if their favorite strategy will get them
banned? It is disheartening to think that you have spent time and money on
something you enjoy and not even get the courtesy of a review or adequate
explaination. If they had suspended all the accounts that were involved for
review for 24 hours and actually reviewed them I would be much more
comfortable with this entire issue. At least it would give the appearance of
fairness. It really looks to me like CQ went further in ST than was expected
and Verant was looking for a way to shut them down. Please note that I said
it LOOKS to me this way.
