It also does more.

Lets see you fire up DOS 6.22 from the 3 floppies, surf the internet to 
your favorite bands site, download an mp3 sample they've publicly 
released, play it, then burn it to a CD, download the song lyrics, edit 
& format them so the chorus is in italics, and the title is in colour, 
print it to an HP laser, take a picture of yourself, upload that picture 
from your camera, launch a voice chat session with your mom say Hi! 
Wave, and then transfer her the picture. Finally write a plain text blog 
of what you did and publish it on the internet.

That's XP out of the box, assuming appropriate hardware.

With DOS, out of all that you can... fire up DOS 6.22 from the 3 
floppies. Oh, and I suppose you can compose a plaintext blog (seeing as 
you did nothing, its trivially easy, even with 'edit')... and save it 
your hard drive where nobody but you will ever see it.
