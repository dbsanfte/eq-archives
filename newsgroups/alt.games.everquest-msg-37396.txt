Brian,

The motherboard components (and video) are all independent of the Sun box.
It, of course, shares disk space, other disks, and, if you desire, the
monitor.  Here is a quote from Sun.

"The SunPCi IIpro card provides a complete PC motherboard integrated onto a
PCI card for use with PCI-based Sun workstations and workgroup servers. The
SunPCi IIpro card is accessed through the standard Sun keyboard and mouse,
with display provided through an X11 window on the Solaris CDE desktop or
from a separate monitor attached directly to the card's primary backplate.

The SunPCi IIpro coprocessor card is not just PC-compatible, it is an actual
PC  that is constructed from real PC components and follows the de facto and
emerging PC hardware design standards. As a result, the SunPCi IIpro card
represents an ideal PC compatibility solution for those who need to
interoperate with Microsoft Windows applications. It even provides Microsoft
Windows applications to Sun Rayï¿½ appliance users through the use of Citrix
Metaframe on the Sun Ray server."

For more information, go to:
http://www.sun.com/desktop/products/sunpci/sunpciiipro_wp010520.pdf

Or, alternatively:
http://www.sun.com/desktop/products/sunpci

Best of all, the 128MB version is only 499$.

Cheers,

Bryce
