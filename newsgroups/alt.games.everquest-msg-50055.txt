Guild are a group of players that have decided to stick together for some reason
or other.
The idea about a guild is that you always have someone to ask about stuff, to
get help from, to have fun with. It do of course also go on the other way, so be
prepared to help others from a guild.
For example im the main tradeskill person from my guild, so i get a lot of
tradeskill stuf free if anyone find it. On the other hand im one of the guilds 2
main porters, so i spend a lot of time porting people around.

To join a guild, first you need to find out about a guild. For example is it
generally not a good idea to join guild that are just starting up, when you see
the desperate guy starting it shout that he pay 5pp to everyone that enter the
guild, or that the first 10 people will be officers. Try to look around, and see
what guildtags you see a lot, and what guild the people you group with/get help
from are in, and ask them about the guild. Find out if you agree with the guild
guidelines (Just had a friend that left his guild because they insisted that you
ONLY went into Tower of Veeshan if you had a guild officer with you. So you
could not go there and find a group of people not in your guild.). If you find a
guild that sound good, ask someone from it who you talk to about joining, and
talk a little to the officers.

Level requirement and other requirements depend solely on the guild. Mine for
example only have general good behaviour as rules, our level requirements depend
on race/class, since were a troll guild, so all trolls/ogres/des/ikkys are
welcome at any level, but since we need casters good race casters are also
welcome. But we wouldnt take a level 5 human paladin.

Yes, you can purchase all your spells. The questions is, do you want to. Some of
the spells are generally useless, and might be a waste of money to get (hey,
never met a druid that have tried to use the Earthquake line of spells).
Same with Conjure food/water.
If you always buy food and water, theres no reason to have those spells (except
for training conjuration).

eq.castersrealm.com have some good guides to specialization for each class, take
a look at them.

Used for Vale Cultural Tailoring, high level halfling tailors need them, but
probable not a big market. But if you meet someone who need them, keep them for
him, he will need a LOT of them, so you can make some money there.

Used in some quest in Rivervale, not 100% sure on details.

I never fished for food, just did it for fun. Later on if you do tailoring, you
need to be able to fish, but theres a LONG way till you need to worry about
that.

Theyre used in tailoring. Theyre also used to make leather paddings, that you
need for high level smithing, so smiths tend to buy them instead of running
around killing a ton of spiderlings.
