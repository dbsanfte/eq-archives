They could, and I could counter-argue that as a leisure activity it's
extremely cost-effective compared to many other pass-times.

  A person could call you an

They could, but I would have a huge pile of shiney, valuable equipment to
show for it.

  The list goes on.

I find it more often shows that the caller considers the call-ee to be an
idiot. . .

That is one way of looking at it. here are a few others:
1) You've spent real-world money on something that doesn't exist.
2) You've broken the rules of the game you intend to play, thus jeopardising
your future enjoyment.
3) You've got yourself a bunch of nice in-game equipment with your new pp,
but you haven't 'earned' them in game which cheapens them. It's like playing
a videogame in godmode, or reading the last chapter of a book before
starting.
4) You've a real-world advantage to improve your in-game position.
Cheque-book gaming at it's worst. This particularly annoys me and not
because I can't afford to it myself - I can.

At the end of the day it's a game. Play it as intended or not at all is my
advice. The items you hanker after so badly will mean nothing to you if you
get them this way. It's pointless and self-defeating. And to do it makes you
an idiot. IMHO of course :)
