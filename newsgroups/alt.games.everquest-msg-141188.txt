I guess now it's time to shit your pants majorly, huh?

I have no scanner and I've said that repeatedly. Just email me a fax number.
Is that really so hard?

Quit trying (and I mean *trying*) to come out on top on a public forum and
let's take this to email, as I've been trying for the last few days. You
seem to think that you're somehow going to change reality and make things go
away by keeping this on Usenet.

Your image is already smellier than trash in here and there's nothing you're
going to do that will somehow magically redeem you. I'm really serious about
taking you up on your offer to come to Florida.

Are you?

If so, answer my emails and let's get this show on the road.

You copped out on TwoHead. Don't disappoint me, too.
