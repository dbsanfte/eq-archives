IMHO, Poisons are sort of a rollplaying part of being a rogue.  I enjoy
using them but there just isnt a great advantage to doing so.  I often
inquire of high level rogues that I meet about there use of poisions.  Most
dont bother.  Some do but "somtimes".  Many say it Arrgo's the heck out of
the MOB (bad for rogues).

Reasons for using poisons:
1. roleplaying
2. fun to see new proc messages and groups reaction to them "A Goblins flesh
begins to melt"
3. you CAN make money with pottery aside from making vials.

Reasons against:
1. money cost - purchased items are expensive
2. time cost     - farming poison reagents is VERY time consumming. Most
people dont save the wierd stuff so your stuck killing greens for no exp or
paying marked up merchant prices when you can find reagents on them.
3. Finished poisons DONT stack.  Add to that the fact that so many poisons
are mob specific I.E. "undead only" "animal only" "castor only" and its just
plain tuff to store that much of a reserve.  I sometimes just carry the
stacked ingreadiants and make the poison on the spot, but this still takes
inventory room and sometimes you just dont have the time.
4. Two seperate skills to raise, Make poison and Apply poison. Both can
fail.
5. You can fail at the applying of the poison and the mob can resist it
often if its even, yellow or red to you. after all, it is just like any dd
or dot spell.

At my humble level of 32, I have my make poison up to 50 and my apply up to
48.  I will probably continue to slowly advance it, but it's not my number
one priority.
