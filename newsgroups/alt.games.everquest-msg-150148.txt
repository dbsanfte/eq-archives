This is how my casual observations seemed to indicate dual weild worked
also, and to train dual weild up I always had great success putting fast
weapons in the slot without worrying about damage ratio, even when I
had relatively slow weapons in the primary slot.  Without changing primary
slot weapon, I got a lot more skill raises per hour going from a 27 delay
secondary to a 17 delay secondary.
