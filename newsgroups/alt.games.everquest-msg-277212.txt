I don't know how much ripostes you get hit with at 30, but at highter 
levels, you can take a pretty good pounding on just the mob's ripostes 
if you are in front of it..

Short of HoTT (which removes all doubt), watching the HP indicators, and 
seeing who is going down the quickest is a pretty foolproof method. Then 
the question is either "What did I do to get agro?" or if you are the 
main tank, "What do I have to f***in do to get agro?" Of course asking 
this in group will lead to suggestions like putting your taunt key up.
