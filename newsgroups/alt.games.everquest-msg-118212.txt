My stepson and I do a Monk / Druid combo.  Monk is human, druid is half-elf.
Both started out in Qeynos.  I think Qeynos is one of the easier newbie
zones to get familiar with.  The city of Qeynos is only 2 zones (Freeport is
4) and the newbie hunting grounds have plenty of prey.  If you are ready to
try a dungeon, BlackBurrow gives you a pretty good feel of them.

Good luck and have fun!
