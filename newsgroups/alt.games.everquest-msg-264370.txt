I  broke my task window hehe. Got a task about 2-3 weeks ago and forgot it.
Finnished it 3 days ago and went to get another but Request Timer said i had
to wait something like 33456:15 and woked out to about 19days. I have /bug
reported it but currently cant get another for about 14 days, silly drunken
dwarf went and broke his new toy.

When OoW came out, several people in a.g.e said that the Tasks feature
needed tuning, as it would often send a player on impossibly difficult
missions  I'd like to buy OoW, mainly for the Tasks, but if they're still
broken I'll hold off.

Are people finding that the Tasks work as advertised now?

Thanks for any information.
