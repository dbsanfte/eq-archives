/agree

Other things to note:

"Hugging" a mob is helpful when it paths badly and will bring friends it 
should not. The best example of this is tin the main room in Paw, where one 
of the tesch mas gnolls (the one in the corner to the left of the double 
doors) will path past the two in front of the doors. By staying in melee 
range, the mob will hop over it's bad path.

Forgetfulness: Mobs will forget you much more reliably when they have 
returned to their spawn. Also, there is a moment when they reset that they 
will not aggro right when they get back to their spawn. Timing it properly, 
you can getthe one that is not quite back to come running without 
reaggroing his friend that just got home.

Warp pulling: When mobs must warp to get to you, they will sometimes warp 
at slightly different times, usually a second or fraction of one. The best 
example is in KC, pulling the Drolvarg Warlords (and hopefully the 
Pawbuster :P) up the stairs... Run up the stairs and through the jail, then 
wait for one to warp on top of you. If you feign right as he hits, most 
times you just get him and his buddies hang out at the top of the stairs.

Kiting for the chanter or rooter: When you know your chanter druid or 
whoever is crowd control, you can bring back multis. Then, kite them near 
the group (not near enough for proximity aggro but near enough for spells 
to land) and let your CC person pick them off one by one. When one remains, 
bring it to the tank. This way, healers don't get aggro before the mezzes 
can all land, and ghettomez doesn't involve getting all the melees to back 
up (at least initially).
