Not all druids are like that. I generally sow anyone that asks unless
I am busy. And it has nothing to do with the mana.

Did you ever think the ones that ignored you were
AFK? In tell hell from trying to deal with 3 buyers? Maybe they were just
busy.

I personally make it a point never to sow anyone at the EC tunnel.
Because if I do, then I have to sow 20 people.
