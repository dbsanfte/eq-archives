Now that the game will display corpse rez
and decay timers if you /con a corpse, I was
able to finally settle the issue of exactly
how long player corpses of different levels last...

The manual claims (for decay times):  30 minutes if
the corpse is level 1-5, or 24 hours online/7 days offline.

As is often the case, the manual is wrong.  Here
are the results of my actual tests:

Level 1 PC: 30 minutes to rez, 30 minutes to decay.
Level 2 PC:  2 hours   to rez,  2 hours   to decay.
Level 3 PC:  2 hours   to rez,  2 hours   to decay.
Level 4 PC:  2 hours   to rez,  2 hours   to decay.
Level 5 PC:  3 hours   to rez,  7 days    to decay.
Above level 5: Same as 5 (3h/7d).

So the manual was right only for level 1, and wrong
for levels 2-5.

The easy rule of thumb is:  Decay is 30 minutes for
level 1, 2 hours for 2-4, 7 days for 5 and above.
Rez timer is a flat 3 hours, or until the corpse decays,
whichever comes first.

(Yes, it's possible that they altered the decay times
for level 2-5 corpses in this recent patch, as long
as they were fiddling with the decay/rez display, and
changing high-level corpse decay times to be a flat
7 days instead of a mix of 24h/7d, but the 2 hour
figure fits well with my prior tests and experiences
for low-level corpses.)

Note that the patch message is a bit wrong too -- it
says that the decay timer for corpses "over level 5"
is now a flat seven days.  However, in truth that's
the case for corpses "level 5 or over" (or if you prefer,
"over level 4"), not strictly "over level 5".

Additional fun with the decay/rez timer display:

1.  As my previous tests had indicated, *mob* corpse decay
    times are 8 minutes if the corpse has any loot, 30 seconds
    if it doesn't.   (I didn't have access to any 55+ mob
    corpses, which are coded to last longer.)

2.  Since mob corpses go to "general loot" after two minutes,
    you can now /con a corpse which someone else has killed
    and abandoned, and not bother attempting to loot it
    until the decay timer hits 6 minutes or less.  It used
    to be annoying wondering how long you'd have to wait,
    now you'll know.

3.  As previously suspected, the rez timer halts *completely*
    when you're offline.  I did tests across two hours,
    and checked the timers of several player corpses which
    were lying around.  Across two hours, the corpses of
    people who were offline had "frozen" rez timers, which
    did not change by even a second over two hours, even
    though their decay timers continued to tick away.

4.  Note:  The decay timer, at least, is not entirely
    in synch with the actual "poof time" of the corpse.
    Several mob corpses stuck around for up to 10 seconds
    after their displayed decay timer had already counted
    down to zero (and beyond!).  In fact, here's a section of 
    my log as I frequently /conned a mob corpse that was counting
    down to poofage:

        This corpse will decay in 0 minute(s) 05 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 0 minute(s) 04 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 0 minute(s) 03 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 0 minute(s) 02 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 0 minute(s) 01 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 0 minute(s) 00 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 15 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 14 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 13 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 12 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 11 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 10 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 09 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 08 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 07 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 1193046 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 06 seconds..
        Consider whom?
        You no longer have a target.

    What's wrong with this picture?  :-)

    As a programmer, I had assumed that "1193046" was going to
    be "-1" in some number of bits, wrongly converted to an unsigned
    integer, but it's not.  The really strange thing is that it
    turns out to be "123456(hexadecimal)" -- that's bizarre.

5.  While traipsing around Greater Faydark, I found a PC corpse
    that conned thusly:

        This corpse is too old to be resurrected.
        This corpse will decay in 151 hour(s) 28 minute(s) 09 seconds..

    Umm...  "151 hours"?  Why wasn't that converted to "6 days,
    7 hours"?  I have no idea -- all other corpses I checked displayed
    in days/hours format when appropriate.  On the other hand, it
    was the only corpse I had discovered which was "too old to be
    resurrected", maybe that had something to do with it.

6.  There was a thread on this newsgroup a few weeks ago
    in which many people asserted that the rez timer for corpses
    killed in /duels with other players was only 10 minutes (or
    so).  I stated that in my experience, it was far longer than
    that.  Well, I found cooperative players and /dueled my
    test characters to death, and the displayed rez timers for
    each one were *identical* to the times listed above (which
    were produced by attacking guards to cause death) -- even
    for the 5+ characters, wherein a /dueled death produced a
    corpse that indicated a full 3-hour rez time.

    So...  Either /dueled corpses actually do have a full 3-hour
    rez timer, or:
       a) the 10-minute limit is only for much higher level
          corpses than I had tested, or
       b) the 10-minute limit is only for /dueled corpses
          in dungeons (or perhaps indoor zones) -- my tests
          were done in N.FP, W.FP, and GFay.
       c) the /con rez indicator is wrong.

    Further testing may be required.  But so far, the results
    match my own experience with /dueled corpses, which is that
    they don't have extremely short rez timers.

7.  Here's the /con of a totally naked (no items, no coin)
    corpse I had just produced from a level 5 character:

        This corpse's resurrection time will expire in 2 hour(s)
                 59 minute(s) 16 seconds..
        This corpse will decay in 6 day(s) 23 hour(s) 
                 59 minute(s) 16 seconds..

    The odd thing is that naked corpses, even high-level ones,
    poof as soon as the rez timer runs out (because there's
    nothing "left" on the corpse worth recovering any longer).
    And yet, this /con shows that the naked corpse would last
    for a full 7 days.

    This is probably just a display bug, I'm sure that the
    server will clean up the corpse as soon as its rez timer
    expires and it sees that there are no items/coins on the
    corpse.  But the misleading display for the decay time is
    annoying.
