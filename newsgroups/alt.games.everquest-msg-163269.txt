Can't cast YV on a horse?  Wow, that bit of information saves me 8.5kpp then.

Perhaps most clerics would still be better off with the horse, but personally, I spend
most of my time meleeing unless the fight is going quite poorly indeed... I've always
been a battlecleric, and the fact that I can now do so effectively just makes it all
the more fun for me.  YV is a massive boost to melee output, I proc much more and hit
more often, and if I dont have a better haste, well, at least its 25%!
