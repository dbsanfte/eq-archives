Just copy the complete EQ directory to the new HDD when you are ready.
Be sure to change any shortcuts you might be using to point to the new
location.

Any file with the extension OPT is a character file. The format will
be  <Character_Name>_<Server_Number>.OPT  Example: Valien_10.opt 

There are other files associated with your characters (such as
ignore/friends lists). These have an INI extension.

The only Registry entry that EQ makes at the time of installation is a
pointer the location that you chose to install the game to originally.
This pointer is only used when you add an expansion. Without the
pointer you have to manually choose where to install the expansion
files. So it's no big deal at all.  

When I put together a second PC to "dual-box". I copied my entire EQ
directory to the new PC, and everything worked perfectly. (I still had
to buy a second copy of EQ and register new account keys)
