It wouldn't matter anyway.  The bonuses are in percentages.  Even if it were
10,000% per person, that's still the same increase per person, leaving each
person with the same percentage of the total.

LV 20 with LV 30, LV 20 gets 20/50 or 40% of the EXP, LV 30 gets 60% of the
EXP.
If there were a 20% bonus, then LV 20 gets 24/60, LV 30 gets 36/60 of the
EXP (remember, you add bonus to ALL factors).

Because you're multiplying and dividing everything, it doesn't matter which
order its done in, the answer is still the same. (you're not adding 20%,
you're multiplying by 1.2, or 120%).

Just like coupons work at stores. They often add up everything, even tax and
then take the discounts, and figure tax on them too (at least around here
now). Really it doesn't matter.
$6 - $.50 = $5.50 + 8% tax = $5.94
$6 + 8% tax = $6.48
-$.50 + 8% tax = -$.54
$6.48 - $.54 = $5.94

EQ EXP works same way, as do all numbers.

(PortionOfGroup + Bonus%) + MobEXP = PortionOfGroup + (Bonus% + MobEXP)
