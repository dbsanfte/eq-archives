That's what I've noticed as well.  Some zones I just seem to cover ground
faster.  And yeah, Netherbian is one of those zones where I "feel" slower. 
I can tell which zones make me feel slow by whether or not I check to see if
I'm actually running.  =)

I've had a not very well thought out theory that zones can be scaled to
increase or decrease perceived distances.  Absolutely no testing whatsoever,
and not really sure how easy that would be to test anyway, as it would
require a combination of tests to be in any way conclusive.
