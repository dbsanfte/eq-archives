I made the preoder mistake with Kunark.  I waited for my order while
everyone else was getting high end loot from the smallest of mobs.  By
the time I got my preoder copy they were tuning the zone down.

As for POP  I doubt if I get it. I have yet to do everything in the 4
worlds now and I have been playing since the start.

If my guild decides to UBER up and start doing larger scale raids then
maybe I might pick it up.
