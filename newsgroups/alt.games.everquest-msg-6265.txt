To be honest, I actually did by Velious now just for the upgraded interface.
However, I did know that eventually I would be going there, and in fact, my
level 13 druid just got back from a trip the Thurgadin, quite interesting at
that level.  I just had to see the sights, plus I wanted a Coldain Scimitar,
and thought I'd just go get it myself.  It's a great weapon, procs now, been
taking on yellows with it, so far, no problems.
