Yeah. It's been an adrenaline rush, which is what I like best about it
so far. However, it's only a "hoot" when it goes well, unless your
definition of Hoot also includes "trying to max out your Corpse Recovery
skill. (104!)"

I was already clued in by the wiser heads at Graffe's that I'm doing
something you're really not "supposed" to be able to do. And it would
most certainly only work for twinks, and only in certain larger zones
with the *right* mobs.  And even then it can go south quickly. But I
figured, what the fuck? I tried it, it pretty much worked, and it's
worth a bit of a gamble to get three or four solo blue mob xp gains from
one bar of mana rather than just one.

The nice thing is that, even if the pickings are slim and there aren't
more than two, I can still use the same boot kiting on one mob for less
mana and not waste time/mana on roots which always break before the mob
dies anyway. I've moved up to aviak harriers now. (FAR more risky, and
I've only done three at a time once so far) but I'll let ya know how it
goes. If I manage to mangle my way through enough xp this way, I'll get
BOF in a couple levels anyway, and the point will be moot. Heh.
