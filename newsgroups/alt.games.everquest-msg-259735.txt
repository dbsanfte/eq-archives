After perusing many postings in this newsgroup I have decided to give you
all the chance to get ahead of the game when EQ2 comes out.

For the mere sum of $20.00 you will receive my personal guide to wealth and
advancement in EQ2.

Upon receipt of your $20.00  I guarantee to supply the goods approximately
six months after the release date.

You will then get all the information that that you have undoubtedly picked
up in-game already.
You will get all the  info that I have farmed off of public websites devoted
to the game - or as much as I can be bothered to record.
You will receive a signed photo of me in my new car to show that all your
$20.00 payments have certainly not been wasted in the local charity shops.
(whatever they are?)

I also guarantee to accidentally post you my website details explaining this
generous offer simply because you happened to post to the newsgroup.


...oh and no refunds given - ever!
