The people that are stupid and careless on a single pull will always think
my pace is too fast.  That is because their minds are too slow.  :)

So, pull a single.  Everybody med up to 100%.  That's your plan?

Come back in a year or two and talk about this some more after you actually win
one.  :P

"If I were wrong"?  I'm sorry...  we're sticking to *this* reality here.  EQ
is not rocket science.  LDoN isn't even close to being the hardest thing in
EQ.

So pulling mobs is a mistake?  Rather wait around for them to come to you on
their own?  Oh, no, you mean pulling mobs that a group is fully capable of
handling with their current resources is a mistake?

Wait...  what you mean is that the puller should assume he's grouped with
slow-minded idiots that *will* make mistakes, thus making his pulling pace a
mistake.  I prefer to think of it as education, or perhaps directed
evolution.  :)

Bzzt, strike one.  More than one version of the spell.

Yeah, and fighting requires your melee to turn on attack...

Bzzt, strike two.  And it's completely obvious that you've either never used
pacify, or never had it fail.  Either way, that was so wrong it made me
chuckle.  :)

And strike three, he's out of there.  Waaaay out of there...

I'm assuming that was a 6 magician group.  I also play a 65 magician and let
me assure you from years of experience, there is *never* a time when the
magician is the best puller.  *Ever*.  Well, except for that 6 magician
group.

After the *load* of misinformation you just went through...  I won't be too
insulted when you think I'm wrong about stuff.  :P

Ahh, but I *am* playing to win.  So to state that there's no risk to the
monk is, again, patently wrong.
