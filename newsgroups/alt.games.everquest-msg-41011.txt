Respond not at all, and you invite more tradgedy.  I, personally, would hope
to see those responsible uncovered.  And if uncovered, brought to justice.
If others attempt to protect them, then I would go so far as to say those
that are protecting them have sided with them, and thus become viable
targets for action taken against them, if they are in the way of the real
quarry.

If I harbored a murderer in the US, the police would not simply walk away
because I wouldn't let them in my house.  They would charge me as harboring
a criminal, and possibly as an accessory to the crime.  I find this
situation no different, once we have some reasonable evidence of who planned
and commited these acts.
