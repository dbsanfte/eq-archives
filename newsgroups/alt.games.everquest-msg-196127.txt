Seems to me this is A) rumor or B) an uber guild showing off, but not 
really a valid strategy.

63 Bard with at least decent weaponry couldn't hold aggro vs. my non-epic 
ranger at 56 (could be 55 or 57, lvl'd through 56 pretty quickly).

This was fighting green-to-the-bard stuff in Nadox while trying to get his 
charm of deception (or something, the one that kicks off when you have an 
illusion up) so I don't think level aggro had much to do with it.

I've heard of people using a weaponshield ranger vs. Emp to control aggro 
initially there (Monual's alliance I think?  Could be wrong), and have used 
a DA/LoH paladin vs. Dozekar to keep the slowers from getting eaten there 
(strategy worked, we just got eaten by repopping roamers and adds).  
Haven't heard much about sending in bards to do the job though ;)

Where the key issue in an encounter is aggro control, give me an SK or 
Paladin over a bard any day.  And probably an EB or epic warrior over 
either of those.  Besides, bards have much better things to be doing on a 
raid than tanking :P
