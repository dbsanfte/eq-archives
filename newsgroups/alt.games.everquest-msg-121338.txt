Hey, I'll do him one better: I'll sell him my account AND let him pay
me to play the character so he doesn't have to do all that work AND
for the character's safety, since he'll have no idea how to play a
40th level character as a newbie, I won't give him the account
password. What a deal!

( Okay, I'm stealing someone else's routine, but it works. ;-) )
