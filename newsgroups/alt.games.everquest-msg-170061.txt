Wandered into SK tonight to go kill a few birdies, and I happened by the
graveyeard. I looked at saw this named, undead gnoll. Conned green to me, so
I decided to take him out. He fell like a rock, and when I looted him, I
found his head. Now, I see it's used for the Red Handband Monk quest. My
question is to the value of it. Normally, I would just find a monk and give
it away, but my bard is very strapped for cash. Hell, I'm still wearing some
Tranquilsong at level 27!!

I understand this is a pretty rare drop. Does anyone know how much it might
be worth? No one would answer me in the bazaar.

Thanks!
Geoff
