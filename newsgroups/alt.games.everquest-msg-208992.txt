The posts are appreciated.  We might have made it with the root / back up
some idea,
and I certainly can melee some with the 'Warhammer of Divine Grace' twinked
to me
by a 60+ level warrior that likes to do that quest.

The crux that I think the beast lord missed, along with my mistakes, was I
needed to med.
I know *exactly* how many heals a Bub of mana represents, and we were low.

The other idea I thought worthy was a slightly larger group with a bit more
muscle (tanks),
and thus remove the melee idea entirely....I get the overall impression at
level 17 my
focus needs to be on the 'keep everyone alive' part, versus damage, and that
the root and
then run to zone to escape death is an option.

I was just bummed by the tell of the person that quote 'You nuke instead of
heal, I'll solo from
now on'.  There isn't an exact science of when to stop the melee part for a
human cleric
with a nice hammer and concentrate on the healing....I guess, as I mentioned
in a /ooc
that it was a lesson learned, and sorry at the poor fellows expense for it's
cost.

Oddly enough it bummed me more that person paid for it, versus a corspe run
for me, but
there was no real way at level 17 (save a bucket of plat for a high level
rez) to own up
and help the person.

thanks,

Aoebe (level 17, in training, cleric)
