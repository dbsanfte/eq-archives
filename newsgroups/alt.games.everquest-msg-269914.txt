That'd be true without the aa's but with aa's, one could work on
skills and I do need to get pottery to 300 as there are a few I need
to make that trivals in the upper 200's.  Shield of Valor for example
is like 295.

Here's a list of pottery recipes and its trival, they go up to 335 and
I have reason to suspect 350 is the max possible skill:
