Nope.  Nothing to do with Cust Service.  This would fall under the purview
of the copy editors and proof readers.  A completely seperate part of the
company.  Can't hang this one around the neck of cust svc.  They'll just
have to deal with the whining that will come their way instead of dealing
with real problems (not to include; "I went LD and died and the GM refuses
to help", "I dropped my wurmy on the ground and now I can't find it and the
GM won't help", "Dude, I just sold some time pharming the phat lewt and I
want my account back, now", eyc)
