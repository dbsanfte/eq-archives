Generally it's best to /shout a request for a rez, and let some time
pass for a Cleric to volunteer.  If no one responds, then you can
start shopping around by doing /who's and /tell's, either in the
zone or farther and wider if none can be found in the current zone.

Please note that your corpse can no longer be rezzed if it's older
than 3 hours (of in-game time -- if you die and them camp for the
night, you can still get a rez within 3 hours of play time when
you log back in the next day).

Remember that only Clerics level 39 or higher have the spells which
can recover some of your lost experience, so don't bother asking
Clerics of lower level for a rez, they can't do them:

   34+ Cleric:  Revive (no experience recovery, but like any rez
   can summon you back to your corpse which is handy if your
   corpse is halfway across the world).  49+ Paladins can also
   do this.

   39+ Cleric:  50% experience recovery.

   49+ Cleric:  90% experience recovery.  59+ Paladins can
   also do this.

   56+ Cleric:  96% experience recovery.

Additionally, high-level Clerics who have the Cleric epic quest
weapon can do 96% rezzes, whether they are level 56+ or not.
And using the weapon (nicknamed the "rez stick"), they can
cast unlimited numbers of 96% rezzes without using any
mana.

Of course, the higher the Cleric/Paladin, the more money they
might expect in payment for their services.  However a lot of
folks still do it for free as long as they don't have to
go far out of their way, or risk death to come help you.
But donations are always appreciated -- don't ask for a rez
if you aren't prepared to pay or otherwise compensate the
cleric for his time/trouble/mana.

Right.


>Can one drag their

No, unfortunately.

What I generally do is get back to my body, loot all but one
mostly-useless item from it (so that I'm fully armored and
ready to fight again), then drag my almost-naked corpse around
to wherever the Cleric might want it.  As long as you don't
loot *all* items from the corpse, it won't poof and it can
still be rezzed (again, keeping the 3 hour time limit in mind).


>Also, I've heard people talk about getting coffins, I think from
>necros; is that part of the process of getting a rez?

That's a different (but related) issue.  39+ Necromancers can
summon a corpse, which means they can teleport it from wherever
it is to right under their feet (but only within the same zone).

This is extremely handy if your corpse is in an inconvenient
spot (like at the bottom of a deep lava pool, or under a cranky
dragon that you tried and failed to kill).

But in order to cast this spell, they need to have in their
possession a Coffin, which is used up when the spell is cast.
The Coffin's price from the vendor is about 200pp, so at
a minimum you'll have to reimburse the Necromancer for this cost.

Also, the Necromancer has to target you first (so the spell
can know which person's corpse it's intended to retrieve),
which means that you will have to be in the same zone
at the time as well.


>Also, what is the general going price to pay a cleric for a rez?

It varies quite a bit, according to situation and level of the
Cleric.  A typical range is 10p at the low end to 100+p at
the high end.

When you get high enough level that the time/expense of getting
a rez begins to outweigh the time/trouble of just recovering
the exp by killing more stuff, you'll know it.   :-)
