But have you seen them withstand eight?

(was particularly thinking more of the 4th and up waves in the ring of fire)

Druid root has a damage component.
*whistles blaisely*

(you mentioned druids specifically, yes, the cleric, paladin, wizard,
enchanter or necro can do a normal root with no damage)

and when was a 55 warrior withstanding 8 of them?  He was complaining that
he couldn't grab agro on all 8.   Although in this particular example
(shield of bane warding quest), yes, the skellies are indeed wimpy enough
for AoE taunt to pay off for a 55+ warrior (just don't catch a guard in it)
