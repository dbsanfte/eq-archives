I don't think Vah Shir bards are tons easier than other races, (certainly not on
a scale with Halfling's 10% exp bonus) but you probably did lose out a bit:

remember all that damage you took running around on selos before getting safe
fall?  A cat's ability to reduce falling damage helps a lot in the early years
(and a bit forever, since its 10% higher than any other bard will ever get)

Do you have a primary slot stringed instrument?  Serious twinks do, of course,
but other than them, getting one in a few levels worth of work in your single
digit days is quite an advantage over waiting till you can earn the cash for a
Lute of the Howler, or get in a group wherever it is they drop.

Primary slot string means you can twist healsong in while meleeing and just swap
in lute on the beat; either a lot more melee damage (if you were punching with
something in secondary only) or a lot more healing (if you were using two
weapons and healsong with no instrument) or a lot less juggling work (swapping
out primary weapon, into inventory to get lute, swap that with secondary weapon,
reverse to get back to two weapons)

Later when you're looking at a cantata (you just got one at 34, there's a much
better one at 55) this will be even more important as it will be more generally
beneficial to your group to have you twisting in your song (hp -and- mana regen
means more people will probably be benefitting) so you'll see even more use out
of this tactic.

There are penalties to Vah Shir to offset these little advantages; we eat twice
what other races do (particularly sucks on expensive stat foods) and are a large
race; without the venerable DE illusion mask there would be quite a few problems
moving around or fighting... and even with it you can't do some things easily
like use the bank in Kelethin before invisibility level.   (With invis, you can
DE form, then invis, walk into the bank, drop DE then bank.  Getting OUT of the
bank afterwards is tons of fun!)
