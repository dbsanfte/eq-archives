If you're patient, you'll often seem them for auction in both EC and
Feymart. You'll want to be looking for higher level Shaman (I *think*
lvl 36 is the minimum? Somewhere around there for that alchemy skill.)
They generally sell for 100 to 120 plat for a ten dose potion. Too
expensive for most untwinked lowbies, but they are a warrior's best
friend in the twenties, thirties, and beyond until you get j-boots. If
nobody is auctioning, you might just see if any appropriate level
shammies are around auctioning, hanging out, whatever and just ask them.
You can probably keep the price down a bit and ensure that (if willing)
they'll be able to make them for you if you carry around a few stacks of
the ingredients they need when you are trying to shop for them. It's a
potion bag and a few other items available from shaman vendors, but
anyone with enough faction can buy them. Forget what they are right now,
but it's easily looked up on the web.
