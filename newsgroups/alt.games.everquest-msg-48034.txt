I found this whole letter a bit depressing.  And then I realized it doesn't
HAVE to be that way.  There are days I *don't* just push for the next level and
more loot.  I sit at the zone and offer buffs and heals.  I follow some new
player around and keep him alive.  I give armor and weapons away that I no
longer use.  I sit in EC and chat with other players.
I also think more people would get *wild and crazy* and try new things if the
cost of dying wasn't so high.  Losing a whole yellow bubble (at level 36) for
*trying* something new seems ridiculous.  (My last *brilliant idea*  cost me 25
plat for a 90% experience rez and I was damn lucky there was someone there who
took the time to do it.  I didn't even have that much on my corpse - had to
borrow from a friend.  But I did learn something:  don't try to take on a
deepwater goblin with a swimming skill of 26. :))
