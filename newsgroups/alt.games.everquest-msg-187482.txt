Nodrop items are often just handins to certain NPC's for xp and coin. Some
arnt, it depends. Most of the normal items you just sell.

Supposedly nowdays, tho I never use them myself.

Usually there will be a couple of keywords that activate the NPC, so you can
definitly short cut it. Not that its much of an isue anyway. The only time I
"talk" to NPC's is when im doing quests, which isnt very often.

The game doesnt have a quest journal or anything like that, but the state of
your questing is always apparent from what items you have.

Most people use spells to heal, and spells heal past 50%. Sounds like your
playing a warrior for a first char, and Id consider that a very bad idea.
Warrior needs a healer (as youve discovered), and these days with most
newbie zones empty 24/7, that is going to make it very hard to get a group
going. Also war is dependant on good gear, which you wont have. I would
suggest a druid or beastlord to learn about the game. Maybe go back to your
war after you know a few things/people.

Quickest solution for you right now, is to "strafe run". This means hitting
numlock to put you in run mode, then as you are running you do control-left
arrow, so you are going sideways as well. This actually gives you just
enough extra speed to outrun most mobs.

Other way is to use a spell to run faster. "Spirit of wolf" is learned by
shamans at 9, druids at 15, and rangers, beastlords later on. Bards get a
song called selos which makes them run fast. Journeymans boots, or "Jboots"
can cast sow on yourself if you have some, but beyond your current ability
to get. Finally, any character of level 51+ can put xp into learning faster
run/walk.

hmm now I wonder if you are playing a war. Paladin? Anyway the memorizing
gets better at higher levels, and the scribing is once only so dont worry
aboyt that.
