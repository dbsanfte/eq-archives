    I think this is really neat, if they do it right. By "do it right", I
mean set conditions on the charm and stat increments such that the charm
covers gaps in itemization or rewards otherwise detrimental behaviour.
Here's some examples of what I mean:

(1) The cloth armour charm, increases INT-caster related stats, is
obtainable at low level. This would cover for the lack of meaningful
low-level INT caster drops, and would obsolete itself as the caster gained
proper caster gear.
(2) A charm that boosts WIS-caster stats based on the INT of the wearer.
This would allow some of the older INT/WIS gear out there, like Runed
Circlets, to become popular again. It would also make certain races more
attractive as clerics.
(3) A charm, monk only, that increases in stats as the monk's weight goes
up. As long as the stats on this were low-end, this could help new monks
with weight issues (since most weight issues happen early on).

    Where this could fail is if charms follow standard "power formulas".
Having a charm usable by WIS-casters, increasing WIS-caster stats, that
grows more powerful with WIS would be silly - it rewards someone for doing
something that's already optimal to do. I'm sure there'll be a few of those
that all the power gamers will try and scoop up.
