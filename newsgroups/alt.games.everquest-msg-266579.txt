that's just my luck lol .... got it this morning at around 9.30am (nice 
postie)

Installed it and had to go out so left it patching ... came back and the 
update notes still said all servers are up. Couldn't connect to any of the 
10 (yes 10) login servers so quit and restarted then saw the new update note 
saying all servers are up except etc.

Hope it's not the usual SOE 4 hour patch that turns into 6 hours+

Is there going to be a test server at some point? .. so we can get our fix 
on patch days :)
