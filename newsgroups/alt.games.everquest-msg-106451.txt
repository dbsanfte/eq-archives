Well, it depends on what you want to do.  If you want to do mostly
group fighting in dungeons and exp camps, there is no reason to rush.
If you're looking to join a raiding guild, or even do many high-end
mobs, nothing helps more than making level 60.  Life just changes at
60.  You won't understand how much until you get there, but it does.

Actually, I see the same people who raced to 60 racing to get AA
points.  I have been 60 for 6 weeks or so, and have 2 AA points.  I am
in no rush to get them, even though they will allow me to fix some
really poor starting stats a bit.  Run 3 will be nice, since I still
fall behind a bit when running from camp to camp in dungeons
(especially DN), but I'm not sweating AA at all.

Life is much, much better at 60, if you raid.  If all you do is
exp-grind, then life is only much better at 60.  Seriously.  You get
resisted much less, you resist much more, your aggro is completely
different.  Any change you're going to get from AA points (other than
run speed for pulling classes) is completely overshadowed by the
improvements that come with dinging 60.  I didn't really believe it
until I saw it myself.  

I personally would have been happy without AA points, but some people
need to feel that they're progressing.  I enjoy raiding, hell, I love
raiding.  I like killing big mobs, and all the other stuff that comes
with raiding.  I love playing with guildies, cracking silly jokes,
doing funny emotes, RPing while we buff, basically anything to keep
everyone busy and having fun during the buff, scout, pull, die, CR,
repeat part of the raids.  
Now that I don't ever have to think 'If I were exping I could be
getting closer to 60' I never want to miss a raid, even a silly raid
we've done 30 times, with NOTHING I could use ever dropping.  Hell, I
still love leading Trak raids, even though I have my VP key, have my
epic, have a SS BP, and have a CoP.  I've killed him probably 20
times, and while the fight itself is trivial, the fun of playing with
people I enjoy, and looking for new ways to make it fun completely
outweigh any 'been there-done that' feelings I might have.
Before I was 60 though, Trak was a pain in the ass, because that two
hours or whatever was time that I could have done another blue bubble
in 59 and been that much closer to 60.
I really did wonder if I would feel like retiring when I hit 60.  I
hit 60 and got my epic in the same week, and got some very nice
equipment upgrades.  I did take a couple days off, because I had been
grinding exp to get those last 3 blue in 59 finished, and exp grinding
in pickup groups drains me.  Within a couple days though, I wanted to
be raiding as much as possible, and found that I could take the EXP
days off, and only do what I really liked doing.
I'm currently doing a fair bit of EXP now, but only because we had
some luck and completed a few of our April goals so early that we've
cancelled some raids while we reset our sights higher.  I'm not
concentrating on maximum effeciency, I've exping with people I like.
My normal group is ranger, druid, druid, me, and enchanter twink for
haste and C2.  We add another ranger or rogue as available, but we're
really just hanging out, goofing off, and powering through dungeons.
Life at 60 is grand.
