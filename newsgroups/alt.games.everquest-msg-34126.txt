Heh, I dunno about that man, I guess if you find just the right spot hell
levels will fly by. According to a friend, he made 45 in 6 hours in Sol B.
He is a Halfling Warrior, had a Fungi Tunic and a Felhammer, plus his other
armour of course, and he had a decent spot where it was nearly constant
pulls. I myself took 3 days of 9 hour periods doing 45 in the Dreadlands
with my DE Necromancer. 45 was a bitch and I hated every second of it,
especially dying 1 kill from dinging and losing a ton of exp for it about 6
times hehe.
