That is your max for level 65. Additionally, each level has its own level 
cap for most skills that is (lvl*5)+5 (usually). In your case I believe 
that weapon skills go up at a rate of (lvl*3)+3 or something very close to 
that.

Having said all that, keeping weapon skills up for a pure int caster is 
pointless. The skills you want to max for your level are the schools of 
magic, channeling, and meditation.

Another point is that for the first 20 levels or so it is next to 
impossible to keep them maxed for your level since you level so quickly, so 
don't be so worried about it until you get to 20 or higher, although the 
casting ones are much easier to raise so shouldn't be that much of an issue 
to keep maxed.
