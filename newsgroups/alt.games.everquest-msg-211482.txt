    Focus items don't increase the HPs of the earth pet. The Earth pet just
gets some added STR and I believe some AC from a focus item. With the focus,
fire pets have air pet HPs, air pets have water pet HPs, and water pets have
earth pet HPs (in addition to some STR/AC bonus). Try your same test on the
34 water pet - you should spot the HP difference.
