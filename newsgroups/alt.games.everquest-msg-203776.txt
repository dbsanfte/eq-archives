My 55 ranger and 55 wizard friend killed one the other day.  Took off a BUNCH
of my ranger's buffs, including KEI, wolf form, all those little unimportant
ones.  It also has a pretty nasty poison  spell.  I don't recall it being that
hard to kill, but certainly not worth losing all my buffs over.  Unfortunately
the zone line at Burning Woods is full of them.
