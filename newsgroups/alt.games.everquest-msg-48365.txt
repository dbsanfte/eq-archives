	Not in EQ.

	Well, my epic has certainly been long, at 170 or so hours in Hate and
still counting.  But it has been neither heroic nor grandiose.  It hasn't even
been all that difficult, in terms of the fights or raids required.

	It has been nothing but tedious.

	I've been there for the slayings of some 60 bosses in Hate.  It stopped
being "heroic" after the second.  It is rather aggrivating to know that the
only reason I do not have Earthcaller is not because I'm not good enough, or
not strong enough, or not smart enough, or not high enough in level, or not
committed enough, or not able to raise the necessary forces, but only because
some fascist at Verant decided there were enough Earthcallers in the game
already and nerfed the stone's drop rate to under 0.5%.  (AFAIK, only three
Shattered Emeralds of Corruption have dropped on E'ci in the last four
months.)
