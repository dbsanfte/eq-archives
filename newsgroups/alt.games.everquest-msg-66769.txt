the main problem here is that we are talking PCI video cards.  which
drastically limits choices.  probably the best PCI video card is the
voodoo 5500 but its only really a good choice for someone who doesnt
mind looking around for the hacked and working XP/direct x 8.1 drivers

beyond that your choices seem to be limited to Radeon or mx400 which
are supported and will play the games.

if the guy who asked the question, had an agp slot than yes,  a true
GF2 or 3 solution would be the way to go.  and would probably with
careeful shopping be manageable for only a little more than the PCI
card is going to cost.
