Another thing I noticed but haven't had the time to really
investigate:  In the non-subbed Escape to Norrath tutorial, I wasn't
receiving damage from the rain spell.  Which was pretty great.  I
remember there being a great 2hb that I used on my monk to level up
the skill (it was insanely fast with a good ratio).  It was a
fantastic bo, but at 44 or so it became terrible, because it had a
rain proc that would start proccing at that level.

Anyway, my glee was tempered when I registered my account and did the
movelog to Stromm.  Apparently that immunity is only on the isolated
Escape to Norrath, because I was receiving damage.  Also, I could
damage myself with DD spells either, which I know I did in the past to
level up my Evocation skill on my enchanter.  I forgot to check that
once I registered, though.

Thanks for all the info, though.  I thought the spell was bugging out
when I was only getting one wave.  It's still pretty dang powerful for
a single target though.
