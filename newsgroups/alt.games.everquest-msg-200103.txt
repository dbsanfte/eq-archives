In the real world a "protection" racket can come around and beat you
up if you don't pay your "insurance". It's a barrier to entry; the economic
defnition of a free market says there are *no* barriers to entry. Not
"only minor barriers", but *none*.

I'm still trying to figure out your last sentence in your paragraph and
how it bears any relationship to what I'm saying. For a start, I'm not
saying that anything should be the case. I'm saying that the current
situation is not a free market. There are circumstances where a free
market is a bad idea (eg. in the case of a natural monopoly) so a free
market is not always superior; despite what some economists would have
you believe, a free market does not automatically solve all problems.

I should add that I'm prevented from selling C3 by the fact that I don't
have it, don't play a class that could have it if I wanted it, and am not
really interested in getting it. None of which bothers me. You seem to be
assuming that I'm complaining as a chanter that I can't get a KEI camp.
Well, I'm not. I'm only explaining that the current "KEI market" is not a
"free market".

The classical economic definition of a "free market" includes a boatload
of extremely unrealistic assumptions. Most real-world markets don't fit
the definition; the KEI "market" definitely doesn't. In fact it doesn't
even come close.

Why should I bother? As I've said a few times, as a rule I couldn't care
less.

However, in a free market pricing information is *also* free, since charging
for price information places a cost on comparing suppliers, reducing the
ability of consumers to compare suppliers. Going around asking each chanter
for pricing imposes a cost on that information (even if it's only the time
needed to send a tell).

I think we're arguing about different things here. You think I'm
complaining that I can't get KEI for the price I want it at. Well, I
very rarely need KEI, so for me the amount I would be willing to pay
would probably be less than the free market price anyway.

I'm not being sensitive. I'm being picky. :-) There are several
characteristics of the KEI "market" in EQ than mean it isn't a free
market. On the other hand, free markets are extremely rare in reality.
The government almost always sticks its hand in. :-)

To reiterate. A free market has no barriers to entry; anybody capable
of supplying a good or service can do so irrespective of existing
participants in the market, and without any cost associated with it.
Strike one; the KEI "camps" and the grief that chanters get for
"breaking" such camps is a significant barrier. A free market has free
flow of information concerning goods and pricing (emphasis on "free").
Strike two; the chanters casting do not give out pricing information
for "free" (i.e. in their /ooc and /shout adverts) - if you want such
information you need to send each one a /tell and hope they reply,
which imposes a cost on the information.

Basically that's what the "free" part of "free market" means.

The KEI "market" in Everquest is *not* a "free market". On the other
hand, almost no markets *are*, so that's hardly surprising.
