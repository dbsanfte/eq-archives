Changes in the last few months have made this a lot more fun at low level.
Make sure you get the latest expansion (for those wondering how I can
recommend this, even though the latest expansion is one of the reasons I'm
retiring soon...I do *NOT* dislike the contents of the expansion, but rather
disagree with Sony when it comes to what should be free to existing players
and what should be for pay), if that's not yet bundled with the latest EQ
Gold package.

The only real problem you might have with EQ is that it seems most people
playing now are veterans of the game.  Being the only true newbie in a group
of players who have other characters in their 60's can be intimidating, and
they probably won't do things in the most fun way--they will be more
interested in quickly leveling up.

The new expansion has a facility to save and recall conversations with NPCs,
which makes it a lot more convenient to do quests.  (It's not as good as it
could be...a real quest journal would be better, but it beats the hell out
of scribbling notes on paper).  That, combined with the travel system from
Planes of Power, and the new mapping system to help prevent newbies from
getting totally lost in the newbie cities, should make the first 20 or so
levels for a true newbie, if you can avoid too much contamination from the
experienced players, very fun.

> Asherons Call 2

I've not heard a lot about it.  One guy at work really likes it.  Another
friend of mine who was a hard core EQ player (level 60 (when that was the
limit) and in a top uber guild (Legacy of Steel)) thought it was a lousy
game, and much prefered the original Asherons Call.

> Dark Age of Camelot

I've only played on RvR servers.

Really nice mechanics.  The way spec points and skills work let you develop
your character your own way.  (Yeah, some ways are better than others...but
there are more viable choices than, say, in EQ).  If you try DAoC, make sure
to get the Shrouded Isles expansion.  Beautiful graphics, and lots of
interesting lands.  Tradeskills suck, like they do in all these games, but
they suck less than EQ because the interface isn't as RSI-inducing.  (And
Spellcrafting looks interesting).

Your enjoyment with other people depends on whether they "get" the point of
the game.  The point is realm vs. realm.

For some reason I've not been able to figure out, DAoC inspires the best
player-made movies (e.g., "For Albion" and "Hero" from
http://daoc.stratics.com/movies/Aladora.shtml).

> Wait For Everquest 2

Don't forget "Star Wars Galaxies", which I believe is supposed to be out way
sooner than EQ2.  Also, the long-awaited "Shadowbane" is supposed to be out
in a few days.  There's much to be said for playing a new game, getting in
when there aren't a zillion spoiler sites on the web, and every play session
you discover something new.  The obsessive uber players will get to places
in a new game faster than you...but at least when you get there, you can do
so before it becomes routine.
