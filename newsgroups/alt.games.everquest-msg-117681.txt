I posted this once before, but didn't get any definitive answers, will
try again just in case.......since installing a LinkSys router at
home, I am getting disconnected from EQ on a pretty regular basis,
about 4 times an hour or so.  If I unplug the router and go directly
from my cable modem to my ethernet card, I never get disconnected.
This is getting very frustrating......anyone else experience this or
know some tuning on the LinkSys that might help ?   TIA !!
