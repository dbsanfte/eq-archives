For my berserker epic, I need to kill 4 rare spawn mobs in various 
newbie areas around Norrath (hmm, might not all be newbie areas... but 
anyway at least one is)

Trouble is, they are (at least one is, I really  should research this 
more) rare spawn off any mob anywhere in the zone type things.

SO, while I can certainly kill mobs a plenty in an effort to spawn, I 
won't actually know if I've succeded unless I happen to run across my 
pop at random.

Option one would be to get a tracker to come with me.  BUT I hate asking 
people to do things for me, hate it worse when there's nothing I can 
think of thats in it for them other than to have helped me out.

That leaves me with a couple options:

  1, find someone playing a relatively low level tracker who -can- 
benefit, and arrange to help him out in exchange for him keeping an eye 
out for my mob,

  2, make a tracker myself, and have him kill and keep an eye out, and 
then log in Zerker when ready.

When I say tracker, I clearly mean a ranger, since they get track at 
level one, while druids don't get it till 20 (already everything in zone 
is green) and bards not till 35 (really really green)

Soooo, given that this ranger probably won't ever be raised to high 
level, but is intended to do more than just sit and hit track (which is 
all he'd need to do if I had two accounts, I could just sit him down and 
go on a killing spree with my zerker), whats a good race and say 5kpp 
worth of gear I could put him in in order to make him as effective as 
possible in the low end of the game?

I'm thinking regen gear, which I can loan him several pieces of, plus a 
nice fast one hander just because the damage cap will prevent a two 
hander from doing any more damage... so the 20/30 weapon I could loan 
him won't do any more damage than a 10/30, and appreciably less than a 
10/20.

And DS potions should help.

HP regen potions?

Long duration buffs... Temp is an obvious one but maybe SLN would be better?

SOW potions... SOE would be nice but won't stick yet right?

What else will help him kill as many newbie zone mobs per hour as 
possible, with the goal of spawning my rares?

Grage, happens to be a chain wearing class already... 53 Berserk, Luclin
