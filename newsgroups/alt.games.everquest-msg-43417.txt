    And why is that? The game may be going on, but YOU are doing nothing
related to the game. It's one of the reasons some people prefer computerized
versions of popular games - the speed at which the AI makes decisions, and
thus the speed of the game. Now if only AI's weren't so poor at times....

    So instead, every six minutes, he should be present to hit F8 (target
Jonah), then hit his /pet attack hotkey. And then go away again. And this is
better how, again? Hitting two keys per six minutes doesn't seem like
"playing" to me.

    So THAT is the problem - you don't like that he can gain XP while afk
and solo! I don't see a problem with a character being able to do this at
some point in the character's career. A necro would be hard-pressed to do
this at higher levels, so I don't see an issue here. I WILL note that a
necro in particular used to be able to do this with ease - they'd clear an
area, space the spawn, Feign, stay to see if the pet could handle one round
of the area, then go AFK as long as they'd like.

>If you find the game so horribly boring that you don't want to be in the

    So if I think being a level 60 necro is exciting, but being a level 20
necro stinks, I should never play a necromancer? I'm able to put off instant
gratification if I think the payoff is there, thank you.

    Your original response said that you only played games that you always
enjoyed. I pointed out times where players may not enjoy the game, but play
anyways because there's fun coming soon and they're able to delay instant
gratification. Which was the entire point of my original statement. From
what you've just said, you seem to agree - you don't enjoy parts of a game
like this, but you can be "bothered" to do them.

    So is this a question of time scale for you, then? Is five minutes of
counting up production values OK for a wargame, but three hours AFK and
getting XP just too long to be away? Are you saying that if I don't like the
long downtime while levelling to the point I'd prefer, that I shouldn't try
to use that downtime productively and instead should just abandon EQ? And if
*I* don't have a problem with going away and levelling, should I abandon EQ
because *you* have a problem with it?

    So hitting F8 and my /pet attack hotkey once every six or seven minutes
IS playing? And don't try to muddy that issue with the "mindless AI" part -
at the level Bergh is at, that mindless AI is what his class is all about.

>That there are instances in the game where you can do this only points to a

it.

    Again - why? Bergh would have been happy had he been of a PC race that
could pull this off - why MUST it be stopped? What dire consequences would
occur if specific characters could advance through specific levels at a
specific place without being at keyboard?
