Oh I know that, I am not even thinking about AA yet.

I do tradeskills as I get the drops for them, and can afford the vendor
purchased items.  Right now, I am concentrating on getting tailoring up high
enough to feel safe doing my 5th shawl combine.  I have all but the final
combine for it done now.  I have been collecting up spider silks for quite
some time, and have 10 to 15 stacks of silk swatches now, and still 7 more
points to go from making quivers.  I have spent a fair amount of time in EK
lately collecting up those drops.  That, and dropping Tarbul when he comes
around, that way, I do get a little xp still.  I am still undecided on which
one to GM, but tailoring is looking a little more promising than it used to.

I know that I could farm for cash, and/or cash loot fairly easily at my
level.
