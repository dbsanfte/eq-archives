posting in HTML...

begging...

Nice introduction to the newsgroup.

>> So I'm asking for some freebies! :)

I'll give you some free advice... DONT FUCKIN BEG.

My bank is always full of all sorts of stuffs, and my inventory (im a monk
so have a weight limit too)  Im not particularly rich either.. not by any
means...  but I still try to do my bit for lower level people.

I gave somebody a spell for free last night, somebody that I don't know at
all (we've spoke maybe 3 times in this NG).. a spell I could of easily sold
for 1.5k+

I was in FV the other day banking..  said the first person to /poke me at
the bank got <random item from my bank>.. managed to create a fair bit of
space that way (loots from BW, Sebilis, Akheva etc.. nice stuff for low
levels)

And you know in all this time, I have NEVER given ANYTHING to somebody who
begged.
I'd rather twink the banker out and the gear rot, than give ANYTHING to a
beggar.

Call it spite.. Im past caring.  When I can bank in FV/FP without some
serious fucking spammage from beggars, maybe I'll be able to tolerate them
more

I made a new wizard recently, level 1 and naked, killing in EFP with that
uber dagger you staart out with.. and actually had somebody /tell me begging
for stuff...  /sigh
