Here's a very common scenario that happens every time a new player starts 
crafting:

NewCrafter checks out the crafting system and decides to try and forge some 
tin spikes. He buys the relevant artisan books, gets the recipes, acquires 
the necessary components and then approaches the forge. He starts a combine 
and he's on his way, watching a bewildering series of green and blue bars on 
the screen that make no sense at all. Suddenly an icon pops up on screen 
with the label "Daydreaming". Huh? Not knowing what to do he sits there 
watching and then after a few seconds takes a massive hit to HP, about half 
his life. WTF? Soon, another icon pops up called "Wrong Ingredients" and 
again a massive hit to HP, and he dies. The damage done is a constant, 
absolute number based on % of your total HP so if you are down in HP for any 
reason you're particularly vulnerable. The day this system was introduced, 
all of the tradeskilling instances were like morgues, littered with corpses 
and very pissed off crafters. Today the deaths are more infrequent, but they 
still happen if you make the mistake of plunging in without understanding 
how the system works.

In this sense, it's very much like combat as it's exactly the kind of result 
you'd expect if you strolled into a dungeon and just started walking around 
wondering what would happen if you got close to some of these mobs ... it's 
an entierly new approach to crafting that's going to require new thinking on 
the part of most crafters who are used to the more passive systems of other 
games.

The skills you use to "counter" each of the bad random events like 
Daydreaming and Wrong Ingredients are in your Knowledge book and have icons 
that actually correspond exactly to the icons of the bad events which they 
counter. So all you really have to do avoid death is have all six of those 
counters up and available on a toolbar, ready to be hit when a bad event 
occurs. Of course, if you don't know this, and you don't have an extra 
toolbar set up and on screen with the relevant counters, you're a sitting 
duck.
