Thats why I prefer to do loot at the end.. i hate when somebody wins
something, and leaves 10 minutes after (knowing they are out for loot for
quite a while yet)

heh i really do know the feeling.  For how much i exped in there (from low
50's to 60 i *only* exped in sebilis) i should be filthy rich, i just suck
when it comes to rolls heh

this week i've lost on 2 lutes, cc sleeves and hands, plus what dropped in
tents that i forgot

Geez lol.  Prexus was different to a lot of servers though, up until very
recently we had rotations on mobs (VS, Trak, Dain) and a planes calendar..
were also the oldest server to never get split, and damn over crowded!!!!

60pp in 45 mins in an area that requires a 50-60 group is as sure as your
ever gonna be (before 50 they dont all expect marzin) look at seb, mobs drop
average of 5pp (from 2-8pp it seems) that means 12 mobs, say 15 just to be
sure, thats about 20 mins of killing

actually my shurikens are over 5pp a stack, in tents 2 days ago i used 200
shurikens within maybe 4 hours - considering i dont loot corpses for cash,
that can be a burdon for me.  (used so many, cuz agro is crappy in tents.. u
can throw 4 shurikens, and the mob doesnt agro.. plus, when splitting multi
agro mobs etc)

For the most part now my cleric only groups with my monk now, so i only
gotta symbol 2-3 people max (only kill in velk though, so doesnt make plat
from mobs)
