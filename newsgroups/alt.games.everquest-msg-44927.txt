I've been hunting in Velious a bit lately and have started quit a
collection of the quest gems that drop there.  Since I can't always
use the ones I get, I'd like to sell or trade the ones I do.  So I
went to Allakhazam's and looked most of them up.  Since I'm not all
that comfortable trusting the submitted prices I thought I'd ask here
and get some more unreliable information.  :-)

So, it goes like this:

Black Marble			6,000pp	
Chipped onyx Sapphire		2,000pp
Crushed Black Marble		1,000pp
Crushed Coral			1,000pp
Crushed Flame Emerald		5,500pp
Crushed Flame Opal		1,000pp
Crushed Jaundice Gem		1,000pp
Crushed Lava Ruby		1,000pp
Crushed Onyx Sapphire		3,500pp
Crushed Opal			1,000pp
Crushed Topaz			1,000pp
Flawed Emerald			1,000pp
Flawed Sea Sapphire		1,000pp
Flawed Topaz			1,000pp
Flawless Diamond	       15,000pp
Jaundice Gem			1,500pp
Nephrite			1,000pp
Pristine Emerald		5,000pp

Anybody see any glaring errors or horribly under/overpriced gems
there?
