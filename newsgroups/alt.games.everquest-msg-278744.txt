Surprisingly, it wouldn't.  It would, however, tell you just how long ago as
an iksar monk I became non-KOS in Qeynos (and Freeport), and how unlikely it
would seem for a high level cleric to be concerned with same.  =)

As it's been nearly five years since I did that faction work, things may
have changed.  I do know that there's an insta-respawn point in the Qeynos
newbie yard that should help, to the right of the path facing out from the
gate.

And I ended up skipping the part of the epic quest that required
Qeynos/Freeport factions, go figure.
