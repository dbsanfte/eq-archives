They don't give the "dungeon bonus" simply because its a dungeon.
They give the bonus because of diffiulty and the need to be in a group
to survive or kill more than one every 5-10 minutes.

I don't think I've ever seen a train in netherbian, all thats ever
there is someone soloing or someone sitting in front of a lvl 60 druid
getting power leveled.   Try doing that in Runnyeye at about lvl 25 :)
