Yeah, that's the lame excuse that's usually given.

In chat rooms, where it's a real-time situation and often rapid-fire,
such abbreviations are valid, especially if it's the accepted norm for
the venue.

It's totally invalid in Usenet or other non-realtime mediums. Speed is
not of the essence here, and good communication skills are valued.

In EQ, if you want me to take time from whatever I'm doing and help
you out, you'd damn well better take the time to ask me properly. If
you're not willing to spend the extra fraction of a second to spell
out "please", then I'm not willing to spend the seconds to minutes it
will take to fulfill your request.
