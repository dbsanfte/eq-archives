If you can BYOG try going into Skyshrine via CS.
The pool room (first room on entry) has Guardians and Sentries in it. Both
can drop armour, most around the same level as Crafted but with much better
stats and saves, the guardian armour is no drop as is much of the Sentry
armour, do a search on Allakhazams under Guardian and Sentry to see what I
am talking about.
The Sentry Armour is chain usable, the Guardian Legs and Helm are great
cleric items (the legs have really nice Saves as well) and both types have
excellent Int Caster Robes, rare but they do drop. The Gargoyles and
Sentries drop velium pieces as well plus 5 or 6 plat a time.

The mobs are high 30's - low 40's some are casters so you will want a decent
healer as well as a porter to get out, oh, and occasionally a raid force
will turn up and clear the room out, just because they are bored and can but
other than that it should be pretty good exp and some decent loot.

You won't get a pick up group here tho'
