I was having that problem on my boyfriends computer, but not mine.  I
figured out it was because he had Yahoo Instant Messanger installed and
running in the backround.  Everytime he got an Instant Message or an e-mail,
I got booted to the desk top.

I changed the properties of that program so that it would only start
manually.
