Now you're moving into my area.  I knew all those years of college would
come in handy some day (although I am chagrined by the caricature of the
professor who can't leave his/her work behind that comes into my mind).

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is perhaps the strongest and most well-known
research in this regard.  I've already posted some info on Maslow today.
There's also another individual who's name I can't pull out of my brain
right now......I guess I may have to pull out the old books for this
one....I"ll get back to you on it.

Basically though they both say the same thing.  Each and every person has
basic needs which must be met.  It is only after these basic needs are met
that an individual can think of how one's actions affect the world directly
around them.  It is only after understanding at this level, and having one's
basic needs met, that one can think about how one's actions may affect
society as a whole.

 Neither of these individuals accepted that not having one's needs met was a
valid excuse (or reason or justification, or whatever you want to use) for
engaging in anti-social acts.  Rather, they both set forth a process by
which society should work together to aid all its members in having these
basic needs met.
