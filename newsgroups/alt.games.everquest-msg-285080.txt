Mostly they expect a full group.  And since what you're doing is unrelated to
your main character (which is what makes them boring to me), they know EXACTLY
what equipment and AAs you have, they're tuned more closely than most
encounters.

There is variation, when they've done a bad job tuning them.  The ones that
are popular (and most boring) are generally ones that are tuned too easy, and
can be done quickly by a full group of semi-competent players who don't know
each other very well.

Depends entirely on which MM.  You can probably do the popular ones with 4, if
you don't mind taking a long time.  But since you don't really care about who
you're grouped with in a MM, you probably should just invite a few more random
folk and do it with a full group.

If you're looking for tough, interesting fights to duo/trio, you're probably
best off taking a small group to the high-end content of a few expansions ago.
