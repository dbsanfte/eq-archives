I don't think Sony should do this.

What would you suggest, and how do you define "ninja looter"?  It's
hard to come up with a definition in such a way that it would make any
sense at all to punish it, rather than just to make it impossible.  

EQ2 had auto-random, but it really bugged me (mostly because it's an intrusive
immersion-breaking feature).

I like it in EQ, where if someone doesn't play nice, you kick them out of the
group/guild and make a note not to group with them again (and to tell
groupmates why).  I would STRONGLY support a decent player-notes capability,
more than just /friend and /ignore, and preferably sharable (or selectively
sharable) across characters, friends, and guildmates.
