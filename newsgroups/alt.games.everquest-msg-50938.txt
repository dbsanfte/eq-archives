in fact  ease of use does make it better.  Some have stated that it would
throw off the balance in the game.  The question is if the balance is set
wrong to begin with.  Functionability shouldn't be comprimised for balance
purposes.

I think 10 banks of 8 spell slots and to switch from one to the other makes
you sit and wait a specific amount of time.  say the total amount of time it
would of taken you to mem all those spells.  standing up or doing anything
else forces you back to the original bank if you don't wait before time is
up.

I believe someone mentioned the previous idea as being in Luclin, and I can
only hope.

I had some people criticize my ability to use the 8 slots.  I can manage
around the functional limitation, i'm just getting lazy to the point where
I'm finding it cumbersome.  doesn't mean i cannot, just that i really don't
want to.
