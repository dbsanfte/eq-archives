I plan to because I can get the full version here cheap with a small
hardware purchase at some outlet (oem) Where as I saw no point in
"upgrading" (really downgrading) from win98 to ME there are quite a few
reasons to go from 98 to xp. Xp is much more stable having the  nt kernel
and somewhat faster. It does have the drawback though of needing like 1.5
gig of diskspace, but its a pretty good jump from 98

Plus I have not actually paid for an OS since win 95 first came out.. and
that was a while back ;)
