First things I would due to update your video card drivers.. Then check for
items being loaded in registry that are not needed.. Then do a complete file
check in EQ.. There is a spot in POS that when I am running no matter what
my connection is it goes ld... bug reported of course but no fix as of
yet... As long as you have no call waiting ect.. you should never even
know.. but dial up is not always the best way to go as at times you can
connect thru the older POTS system which sucks at switching.. and might be
why you still get drops.. Just some guesses.. Hope it helps
