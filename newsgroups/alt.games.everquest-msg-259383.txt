No sensible healer is going to chase someone who's running from a fight, 
especially if he's not the MT.

BUT you don't have to run away from a fight, or out of range of a 
healer, in order to find moving faster than a mob useful; you can also 
run around in tight circles with it on your tail.  While it is chasing 
you it isn't hurting anyone at all, and when the group gets around to 
dealing with it then they do.
