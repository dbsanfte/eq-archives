I was just waiting to get the call from a preacher who

Actually, I received this very same "Snow White" virus from my
Brother-in-law...who is a minister in a Born-Again Christian church.
Yes, there was quite a frantic, apologetic follow-up from him.  He was
humiliated, and rightly so.  The original e-mail *was* in fact sent to
everyone on the church mailing list, plus all his personal contacts.
Unfortunately, in his follow-up he stated as he was writing up a sermon
about Satan's power over the internet.  Indeed.

/em rolls eyes.
