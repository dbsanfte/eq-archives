Hehe, and sometimes you get lucky...we had a Fear raid, and were not
strong enough to do anything inside the ring.  After a couple of
incidents near the end of the raid, where Cazic aggroed on a couple
people, and we barely avoided something bad, we decided to leave,
because we'd lost enough people that if something bad did happen, we'd
have a hard time with corpse recovery.  A shadow knight picked that
time to go LD.  We hung around for quite a while, but he didn't make
it back, so we reluctantly left him there, LD on the North part of the
East wall.

He finally got back on about 4 hours later, and managed to make it
out, FDing his way to the exit.  I think it was his first time in
Fear, too.
