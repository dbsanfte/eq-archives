    Congrats! Our guild has been doing these almost non-stop since the quest
came out. I've been encouraged to bake again!

    You don't want to know what you could have sold those components for.
Suffice it to say you really paid quite a bit more than you know.

    Better lucky than good! I think I'm 4 for 30 at 184 skill plus Geerlock.

    Foragers make out like bandits with stats food. And the picnic has great
stats.

    This part is a good way for a druid to make risk-free cash right now.
Poles are selling for 1000 each on my server, and the Oak is selling for 500
each. Dragon Egg Oil brings in good cash, too, but nothing like the first
two items.

> Star Ruby Encrusted Stein: 2 Iron Oxides

    People going for 250 Pottery skill up on these. On my server they sell
for up to 500 pp, usually closer to 200-300 pp. The Iron Oxides are being
purchased by the server's top potter for 1000 pp each. (She sells her Idols
at 2-3 K each.)

> Golden Idol of Tunare: 12 Iron Oxides

    /wince - on my server that's 12000 pp for an Idol. I still have an extra
Idol from when I did combines for a guildmate, and have so far resisted
selling it for a quick 2 K. I've also resisted selling the full stack of
Divine Crystalline Glaze I have for 20 K.

> Mistletoe Cutting Sickle: 3kpp

    At 180 skill plus Geerlock, I made all three pieces of the Sickle first
attempt (one was trivial). 250 skill smiths seem to be going one in three or
so on these. On my server the completed sickle is going for 2-3 K.

> Ceremonial Solstice Robe: 3500 and 5 stacks of silk swatches

    Those stacks of silks were huge for that tailor - bet in these times
he'd pay 100 pp each for them. On my server they're going for 4 to 5 K, if
you can find the few 250 skill tailors out there (some are hiding until this
passes). Some people are using them to skill up from 158, as skilling on
them with a sale price of 4 K is actually a winning venture. I got awarded
the Shears off Shei last night (plus 15% Tailoring), so I'm thinking of
asking my guild to help me get to 200 Tailoring (I already have Pottery over
200) on robes so the guild will have a near-250 Tailor for future projects.

> Demi-sec Champagne: 300pp

    Lots of melees had near-250 Brewing from the coldain ring quests.
Shouldn't be hard to find someone that can make this.

    Payment for a port? /faint. Why couldn't I be around when people like
that need a res? (Although I did get Netted Kelp Pants recently in exchange
for a res....)
