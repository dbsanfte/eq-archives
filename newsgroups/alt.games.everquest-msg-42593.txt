I judge from your posting style that:
  a) English is not your native language
  b) You're simply a lazy typist
In either case, you obviously have a bit of a problem with comprehension.  Let me
help by showing your that, yes, your question was indeed answered.

You're question, paraphrased is:
  "I'm bored with EQ after 2 years of playing.  Is there any point to selling
   my account?"

Here is the first reply to you by DT:
"Besides running the risk of the accounts being banned (either before
they're sold or after, in the latter case, you'll be receiving lots of
hate mail from the buyer)? And definitely having your ass flamed here
if you advertise it here? Nope, no real point."

Let me break this down for you into simple pieces.
Your question (again): Is there any point to selling my account?"
The answer:  "Nope, no real point."  <-direct quote from DT.
The reasons:
    a) Your account could get banned.
    b) The person that you sold the account to would be very angry at you
       for selling him/her a banned account and could cause you some trouble.

Additional information:  IF (you seem to have missed the -if- part so I'll say it again)
IF you advertise the sale of your account here, you will be flamed.  In other words, he
didn't say you -were- advertising.  He was giving you a heads up of what would happen
IF (there's that word again) you decide to advertise the sale here.

Once again:
  Is it worth selling my account?  No.  It could get the account banned and the person you
  sold it to would be upset.

So you see, your question was answered.  Don't you feel better now.  There, there.  All that
fussing just wasn't necessary.  It's okay now.  Calm down.  This is what happens when you
miss your nap time.  Have some milk and cookies ant it will all be better.
