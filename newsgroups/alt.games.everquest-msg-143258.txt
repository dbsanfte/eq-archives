Has anyone experienced this: Could not get my pet kitty to appear in
South Karna, It said i had summoned a warder, the icone showed, but
pet was not visible. I zoned into lake rathe and pet was visible,
zoned back to SK, pet Vanished again. HMMMMMMMMM, I am a level 30 BST,
and this never happened before, very frustrating. I petitioned and got
no response. Any help would be appriciated, thanks, Larry.
