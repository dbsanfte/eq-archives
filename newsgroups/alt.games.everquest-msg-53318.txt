"My bad" is slang, used as a variation of "My error" or "My mistake".
The problem is that "bad", in this case, is being used as a noun
(replacing the nouns 'error' or 'mistake').

Of course, 'bad' isn't a noun - except in rare cases when it's being
used as an attributive noun; to be a valid attributive noun, it must
precede another noun which it describes. In "My bad", it does not
precede another noun.

'Bad', most properly, is an adjective. As with the attributive noun
case above, though, "My bad" is invalid because there is no noun for
'bad' to modify.
