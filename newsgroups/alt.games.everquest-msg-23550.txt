I moved over to Vallon because I was sick of all the 12 year olds and the
high server population on Sallon. I took about 5 friends with me and I have
to admit this pvp server is the most fun I've ever had on EQ. I got really
tired of creating a character then twinking him with 3-4k+  gear to be pl'd
for 15 levels only to be tired of playing it before I even started. On this
new server I spent the first 5 levels trying to make enough tattered and
loot enough cloth to make a full set and rusty weapons were horded treasure.
I've also seen more role-playing on this server than any of the others I've
been on. I just wish I would had moved 6 months ago. If your bored and
looking for a change this server gets a big thumbs up from me. btw no
twinkage sure helps your skills go up faster  :P

Lendair 6th season cleric of tunare on vallon zek.. look me up sometime
