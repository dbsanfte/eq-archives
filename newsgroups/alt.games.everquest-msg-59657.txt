As you advance in levels you will have more options, my mage (female
erudite) has several outfits. The Shardtooth skin with flayed skin leggings
gives her an outfit that I call my Genie outfit. I think the mammoth hide
leggings give the same look. My friend has a DE and it shows her bottom but
looks really cool. I have ghostly robes which friends say make her look
angelic. Advisors robe mainly because I have apothic gloves and its the only
thing that looks right with them. Had my eye on getting Tola Robe but think
the gloves will look stupid.
