Get the Gold package.  It includes all but the very
lastest expansion pack, which you will probably want
since there are many goodies in there.

For maps:
www.eqatlas.com

For class info:
http://eq.crgaming.com/

For item/quest info:

The cost to play is $12.95 a month but you get a
discount if you pay in 3 or 6 month chunks.  I'd
recommend that you start monthly to see if you like
it.  BTW, the Gold package comes with a free month
of access.
