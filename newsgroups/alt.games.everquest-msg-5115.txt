There are files named "warrens*.*" in your Everquest directory,
assuming you actually downloaded the optional Warrens zone files in
the first place.

If you haven't specifically done the Optional Patch to download the
Warrens files, and hence have never actually successfully been *in*
the Warrens, you need to do the optional patch.

Otherwise, take another look in your EQ directory, sorted by file
name.
