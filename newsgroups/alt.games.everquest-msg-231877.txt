}Goblin Gazughi Ring has insta-click Invisibility to Animals. You can get 
}it off the Sarnak Courier in LOIO, if you are patient, or buy it in the 
}Bazaar. I sold mine recently for 5k, after Innate Camo made it redundant.

@#$%@!!

I've been trying to get one of these for my bardly twink for weeks now...  
My 34 wood elf ranger has whacked so many placeholders he's gotten to 
dubious with Legion of Cabilis.  I've killed over 180 sarnak couriers and 
-no- -freakin- -ring-!  Well, I lie, I got that other ring he drops, and a 
bloodstone ring once.  I've been watching the bazaar, too, and only seen 
one go up for sale.  Some freak wanted 65K for it.  Which almost seems 
reasonable considering the luck I'm having with this camp.  Sigh.

Alla's says people get it somewhere in the 20-60 kills range, but this is 
just ludicrous.  I'm starting to wonder if I'm doing something wrong.  95% 
of the couriers I killed were in the valley between the windmill and the 
lake.  I found a couple waaay back in the hills toward the sarnak fort, 
though, and one time I found one up Northwest of the lake which really 
suprised me.  Has anyone noticed that it drops off a courier in a 
particular place, perhaps?

I'd really like to try a little charm kiting.  But I just don't have 65K 
to blow on it.  5K, I'd probably spend.  Sigh.  Anyone need a Goblin 
Skinner? :)
