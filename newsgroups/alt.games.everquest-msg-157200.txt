Actually I quite enjoy doing the same 10% of content that everyone else
does, the entire point of my original post was to point out what a waste of
resources the situation is though. I said nothing about not enjoying my time
in EQ, as once I find something unenjoyable, I stop doing it, simple.

Not only do I not need anyone telling me when I should stop doing something,
I also do not need anyone telling me what I do and do not like.

BTW - what's the deal? Was there a clearance sale on stupidity that I missed
or what?
