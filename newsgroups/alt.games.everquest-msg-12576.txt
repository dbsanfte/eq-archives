Well, its not exactly a private newsgroup, that would be pointless.
Plus no one owns a newgroup.  I think of it as more of a project
newsgroup.  A once abandoned newsgroup that will some day thrive with
a life of its own and by x-posting stuff I'm interested in there, it
should attract people with similar intrests.  And hopefully it will
end up being a fun and interesting place.
