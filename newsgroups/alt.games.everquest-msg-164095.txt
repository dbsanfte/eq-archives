That's great for you, I'm glad.

But you know, I'm not dumb enough to expect everyone plays the game for
the same reason i do.

I play characters to enjoy the raid experience and playing with my
friends.  Building the character is generally *not* fun to me, it is an
investment which pays off with huge fun when I use that character to
succeed at the type of events and raids my guild and I enjoy.   That
ability has been destroyed.  The investment has been made worthless.
