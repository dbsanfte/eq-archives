I don't see as such.  To me, those differences are key to why I think SoE is
in the wrong.

That excess being an integral part of the decision to make the trade.  I may
not have found the exchange to be worth it had the tribute value been less.
The deal's been sealed, and now SoE wants to change the terms.  That's where
I have the problem.  If my truck's finance company did that, ie added
another interest point retroactively after I had paid in full and threatened
to repo the truck if I didn't pay, I would have a strong fraud case against
them.

In my eyes, it comes down to the basics of every deal.  Sony offered,
players accepted and acted accordingly (and made decisions based on that
deal).  As far as my personal (albiet, Ayn Rand-influenced) values go, Sony
should honor the deal, regardless of whether it was a bad deal or not.  What
they're doing is no better than me demanding three years worth of fees back
because I made a bad decision by starting EQ, or a fat guy suing McDonalds
because he made a bad decision in eating twenty trillion Big Macs.

On another note, however, I will agree that it sounds like the tribute
values offered seriously violated the principle of equivalent trade (Ok,
that's it... no more Full Metal Alchemist for me...).

People cannot gain anything without sacrificing something.
You must present something of equal value to get something.
