yes but barbs can carry so much more than that poor little enchanter could
I've gotten stuck in there too.  A place that's just as bad are the 
pools in Sanctus Seru.  Don't even think you'll get out of there at all. 
  My poor guild leader got stuck in there for a half hour.  He was lucky 
I was online, no one in the zone, none of the other guildies on.  I had 
to go to the nexus, beg a druid to come there and help and then show the 
druid where the zone was, he had no idea where to go.
