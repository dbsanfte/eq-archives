Turn the tables. If an american group executed an iraqi businessman 
after a successful iraqi invasion and occupation of america... then yeah 
I think the american service contingent, and perhaps even america at 
large would be more zealous about this 'small victory against the 
invaders' than one might care to want to admit.

That's your opinion. I know guys (and girls) who'd rather be executed 
than get raped & sodomized. Your saying it doesn't even 'remotely' 
compare...I think for some the execution even compares favourably.

And as a crime; I think in general the criminal that seeks to rape and 
sodomize is far more sick and degenerate than the one who seeks to murder.

Moreover, the terrorists were seeking to make a political point... the 
americans were doing it for shits and giggles. There is a perverse logic 
to the terrorists actions... I'm not saying its more noble or 
anything... but at least its not like the terrorists murdered him 
because it was Friday and there was nothing on TV... which pretty much 
sums up why the americans did what they did.
