Seeing as how a thread that was meant to thank me got turned into a flame
thread, I felt the need to contribute.  =)

That may very well be.  However, I myself see nothing wrong in trying to
shorten the learning process.  Asking for a tip here and there shouldn't be
seen as "not trying hard".  Someone a long time ago struck flint to steel
and made fire.  That person didn't tell the other cavepersons, "listen, all
you have to do is look at your problem (it's cold!); look at your
environment (rocks everywhere!); and if you can't figure out how to make
fire you're not trying too hard."

Personally, I don't see much fun in wiping your raid over and over and over
again trying to figure out the exact positioning.  Again, I see no harm in
asking, "How do you avoid the Arch-Mage's mana-draining DoT" if it means
saving a few wipes.  As with everything in EQ, execution is more important
than the strategy.
