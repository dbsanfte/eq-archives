I know it's my standard answer, but the best bet is usually to check the
board for your class - for a druid, one is www.eqdruids.com - then take the
forums link.  You could kill Golras in Timorous Deep - there are about 9 on
an iceberg in the south of the zone.  Each can drop from almost nothing to 5
pp - they will provide you with experience and start building your bank
account.  Some druids might try Hill Giants in Rathe, but without C3 anymore
the time to kill one and the danger involved might make it too much of a
gamble.
