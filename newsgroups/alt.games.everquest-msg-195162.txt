Hi There

After lurking for a while I have the following

K6-2 550Mhz
2Mb Cache on Epox Motherboard.
AGP 2, 66mhz ATA,
384Mb 100Mhz Ram
Creative Geforce 2Ti with 64Mb
US Robotics External 56K Fax modem.
Win98Lite.

I run at 1076 x 768 16bit colour
I use all new models except Barbarians, Erudites and Trolls
Use texture caching.
Mipmapping off.
3D texture compression off.

EQ did complain I was running beyond my specs.

But I find that I still get 52 fps in old zones.
37fps in new zones especially those with lots of moving trees and 19fps 
in Bazaar and PoK (Note this was with a graphics card tester running 
behind EQ) and it did disconnect / crash after a few mins.

Running Unreal Tournament I get 79fps from Unreal's in game monitor.

The secret is:

1)  Win98lite. Which means no IE or Outlook. Totally stripped from 
system. Gave me 84Mb back on the hard drive.
This means nothing running in the background during normal use. Don't 
know if that's true in EQ but it does cut the modules that are loaded. 
Usually have 294Mb of free main memory when EQ loads.

2) C drive, Win98's cache and EQ are all in separate partitions
This means less fragmentation and faster access.

3) I shutdown everything but Systray and Explorer before dialling and 
starting game.

4) All programmes that run at start up in the background were removed 
unless they were necessary or could be disabled.

5)I frequently run Ad-aware and Spybot Search and Destroy. This cleared 
2 common hidden trickle down loaders and uploaders.

6)I de-fragment after each game. Scrap Dbg.txt (Unless I have had a 
problem and clean out unwanted logs.

So apart from my ISP Losing EverQuest's address for a month due to 
router problems.

And the most infuriating 29 days of Error 1017 solved by the last patch 
but one.

I have had a great EQ time.
