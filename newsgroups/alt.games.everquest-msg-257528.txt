Strictly INT or WIS, whichever is higher for brewing.  The higher you get 
the stat the better for skillups.  You have approximately a 2x chance of a 
skillup on a successful combine as on a failed combine, so, generally, even 
if you take a hit on you primary stat, it's worth equipping a geerlock for 
additional successes.  For the actual formulas, dig around on eqtraders.
