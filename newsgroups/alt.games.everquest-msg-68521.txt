Oh that's right anyone who critisizes Verant is just a stupid troll.  Long
live the mighty Verant!  Because, of course, there haven't been any
problems with the product since they released it.  There have been no
bugs.  All those crashes are just adding character!  Down with the
dissenters!  Down with those who wish to share their problems!  Down with
people who seek help!  Down with people who do not yet know everything! 
Down with everyone who has not yet seen the light!!  

That's right.  I'm a fucking troll because I've had a problem with
Verant.  I'm an asshole because their software crashed my machine and I
was unable to get any help repairing the damage they caused.  I'm a prick
because I've had the *gall* to actually complain about this!  How dare I? 
How dare I criticize the mighty Verant?  

Long live mighty soldiers of Verant!

Jesus, what a fucking retarted newsgroup.
