Let's look at one of the 'big things' that distinguishes EQ from all it's
competition. You don't solo as well...

Really, that's one of the big 'benefits' to playing DAoC, AC, AC2, AO, an
sundry others... they made the games much more solo friendly. Everyone has
the ability to go out and advance, and screw everyone else.

But are they doing as well as EQ? SoE must be doing something right.

But think about it. I happen to (have played) a decent soloing class,
(retired now, as I'm beta testing SWG). In fact I was forced to learn to
charm solo with the advent of KEI, as noone wanted my pansy clarity/clarity
2 casting butt in their groups, unless it was somewhere which demanded
excellent crowd control, which is the enchanter's art, and an art which I
may not have mastered, but I was certainly a high ranking journyman, locking
down and dealing with some monster trains in my time.

But the nights I remember fondly are not the nights when the exp flowed like
water, and the plat flowed into my coffers nearly as fast, but those nights
when I was in a group and we boldy went where 40% of the server has and will
never go before. I have a guildmate with 7 60+ chars... 7 of them. Up untill
two months ago, he'd never been past the front porch in The Hole. I know
he's never been to lower Guk, and I doubt he's ever been more than 2-3 rooms
into Upper Guk. Acrylia Caverns remain a mystery to him. Runnyeye and
Splitpaw are worlds of terror to him. I couldn't get him into Droga/Nurga
for 10k plat. Why? Cause he SOLOS! And you can't solo there. We got everyone
in the guild Seb keys, he wasn't interetested.  Etc...

Vox, Naggy? Mythical creatures, never seen as he would have to get with
other people to do that. Fear? Hate? Ditto.

And as for all of you saying they have destroyed soloing... there are two
nerfs that give you the ability to claim that:
a) Under 46? No Uber buffs for joo.
        I disagree that this is a major cripping blow. Makes life tougher.
I'm sure all the enchanters hanging in your zone will be willing to part
with clarities for a small donation. It may not last as long as KEI, but
it's certainly less expensive.
Same as other buffs. Most of them have pre-level 51 versions. I tend to
disagree that a level 25 running around with Kei, Aego, PotG, and similar
buffs is soloing... more being powerleveled. I don't want to get into the
'when I was your age' arguments, but the game is easier now than even a year
ago.. and all those who came before made it. They didn't put a stopsign on
you. They put in a few more speedbumps.

b) Exp nerf in the Planes of Power.
        Ok, this hurts some. Some. You and I both know that it's still the
best xp in the game, hands down. Frankly, I know an enchanter who is always
asking me for equipment advice. I'm better done up than his twink enchanter.
But he went from 51-65 in 6 DAYS solo, grouping only long enough to get a
flag or two.
He spent several k plat on buffs doing it, but he did it. Tell me that's not
too fast. The same day he hit 65 (hit 65 sunday at 9 am) when I talked to
him at 10 pm, he had already picked up dire charm. And he didn't start AA
till he hit 65.
You do have, imho, a better gripe than the a) series people though. Not a
lot, but some better.

Benefits to the soloers: There is a benefit that I don't think you all have
realized at this point. Hundreds of soloers, because that was 'the best way
to get xp' have just become group players again. And will those groups be
hanging out in nice wide open outdoor solo zones? Not if they have a couple
of ounces of intellegence. They'll be heading for the dungeons. Larger
ZEM's, better loot, and probably 80% of them are empty these days.

/em puts on his Fire resist gear.
