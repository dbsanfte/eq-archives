Have no idea how the EULA got involved in this and mine was no analogy
it was a direct reference to the FACT that it costs real money to play
this game. This was in contrast to Eric that was of the opinion it
didnt...or at least made the silly statement refering to spending
money.

Copywrites carry the force of law not EULA, worst sony could do is ban
an account. As for Sony taking yantis to court...well they have no
real case. Hes violated no law and sony would have hell to prove
injury. Yantis could then very well suite the crap out of Sony so,,,,
