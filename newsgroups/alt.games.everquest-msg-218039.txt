Not strictly true. A computer-run RNG can use chaotic inputs: things 
like network traffic metrics and UI "biometrics" can be completely 
nondeterministic provided they are appropriately defined.

Actually, the odds are identical.the odds of rolling a d20 100 times and 
coming up the same number every time, is precisely the same as rolling 
that d20 100 times and coming up the same every time, but passing it 
around to a random number of friends to roll between your rolls. In 
either cases your rolls are 'independant', there are 100 of them, and 
the probability for each of your rolls is 1/20... so either way its 1/20 
^ 100th.
