I don't think that's exactly what he meant. He was referring to the A.G.E.
serverwide chat channel you can access from within EQ.  To join type in
/join serverwide.age :age

The first age is the chat channel and the second is the password.  Passwords
are usually the same as the channel and are only there to keep someone from
adding some dumb password and locking everyone else out.

Your specific class should also have a serverwide channel ( I don't know
what all of them are) and another handy channel is EQTraders.  This is the
channel for tradeskillers.
