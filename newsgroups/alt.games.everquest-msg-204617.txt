As goofy as it sounds, my (now) 31 druid and (now) 41 monk
have been steadily pulling giants from the giant fort in G.
Divide for a while now.  It offers 3 good things: (1) ok
experience (more interested in getting the druid up to
hunt with my 55 rogue), (2) decent faction (we're both
aminable in Thurg now), and (3) decent plat (giants often
drop 2-4 pp, plus heads/toes and velium/drakkel weapons).

The druid is bound at a shop in PoK, and gates/ports to
sell and come back.  I like this spot (even though I know
of better exp places) because it is a good mix of exp
and money...usually you have to choose just one and go
for it.
