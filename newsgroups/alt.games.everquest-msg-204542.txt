I can't imagine how you could possibly kill -anything- for 5 levels and not
get a few hundred pp out of it.

I'll throw out a suggestion, though, go to Eastern Wastes and kill Ulthorks,
they drop a average of 3pp each, plus sometimes drop velium weapons which sell
to vendors for around 5 pp each, and ulthork armor you can sell in bazaar for
5 to 20pp a piece, and ulthork tusks that can be handed in in Cobalt Scar, 4
at a time, for random gems or the tusks themselves seem to retail for 50pp
each if you dont want to play the lottery.

This probably isn't the most lucrative way to spend those 5 levels, but its
not bad, and you'll do well over 100 pp per level on this plan alone.

Another strategy is to level up wherever you like, and farm greenies for pp
instead of worrying about whether your exp mobs have cash potential.  Go kill
Bandits in the Karanas, for example, and turn their sashes into bronze
weapons, you should be able to make 100pp in one session with them easy.

Or go hardcore, and farm spiderlings in Feerrot, plus pelts, a little
tailoring skill, and whip up Leather Paddings, which should net you the kind
of plat you are looking for in just one or two sessions with no risk at all.

Or have your warrior join a seb NG group and walk away with a Kpp or two for
the session, then go back to your druid, who's already admittedly a twink
anyway.  Why work hard when you have a sugar daddy out there to take care of
the little money issues like this one?
