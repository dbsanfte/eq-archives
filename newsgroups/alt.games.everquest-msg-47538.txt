I'm not quite sure what you mean.  :)  I never implied that the arrows were

Yes, but then where would we be without all those useless features? <grin>

Oh yeah, possible yes, but, will they add it is a different story. <grin>

In that case, request that they go un-anon for a moment.  I suppose I was

If you make a mistake completing a puzzle, there should be equal but

Would probably be easier to make the NPC not accept it in the first place
then.  The system for "requesting" anything back from a NPC would be
difficult, which is basically what they would have to do.. since I could
then just waltz up to any NPC, give some money, if I get it back, "oh, you
aren't a quest NPC more than likely."  Would a feature like giving the money
back be nice?  Heck yeah, but, when replying to most of this post, I was
trying to pretend I was VI. ;p  Though many of the suggestions he gave (like
98 percent of them) I found to be VERY good ideas personally.  Though, from
a VI aspect, bah, they stunk. <grin>

Its part of everyday life.  There are some very confining
rules/regulations/laws out there because everyday someone out there abuses
or exploits the once given leniancy.  What happens to that once something is
abused or "exploited?"  Welp, they usually become less tolerant or make it
so that the innocent suffer.  Something we have to, unfortunately deal with,
atleast in life... and in game, unless you quit. :(

Right, as the reason for my recommendation to become more less invis to the
mob and the mob invisible to you (ie. no agro) so that this couldn't be
exploited.  You didnt clip that part of my statement off before replying. ;p

This was a "guess" as to its reason, since the reason isn't explained to us

Agreed.  Using the mouse scroller/wheel is FAR more effective than using
arrow keys or clicking on the text box up arrow, IMO.  It almost, if not,
appears to halt the continuous appended text on the bottom when using the
scroller/wheel.

Exactly.  As I placed up above "this is at a RPing stand point of course."
The purpose of Role Playing is just that.. to presume the ROLE of your
character you are PLAYING. :)

As do I, but, even in high resolution mode, I cut down on those things on
the screen.. in fact thats the greatest feature the full screen high
resolution mode offers, IMO.  The fact that, "hey I dont care what buffs I
have on ATM," flip, away they go.  Or, "hey I dont like this or that," flip
flip flip, they are off as well.

Showing graphics to represent the position in reading a file, installing a
file, etc.. takes more overhead "than necessary."  Again, Im trying to think
from a programmers perspective in this situation/recommendation/comment.

Let them fix what is wrong now, before going and adding more "fancy"
items/features (which is more lines of code) to get bugged/go bad. <grin>

Actually, after posting this.. I would NOT be shocked to say the least if VI
did add "taxes" to the game.  The economy is afterall according to them
"precious." <shrug>  Looks like there is no escape of Uncle Sam (or a
version of him).  Though, if they DID add taxes, they sure as hell better
add INTEREST to my bank account.. that yes, would probably be taxed, but,
atleast it "balances" the "precious economy." hehe <grin>

Aye.. I too am frustrated and indeed they only work in "most" cases for
sure.. though, what I really dislike is when people in a group cannot get
through to themselves that they SHOULD loot whenever possible.  Yes, I know
the life of an Enchanter and we've got it rough sometimes when it comes to
others that believe we are a tank or exactly what it is we can do for
them... (ie mez, charm, mana drain, etc, etc, etc).

Unless you are totally new to a zone, and I would seriously have to say if
you arent.  A snared mob looks just like that.. snared.  As you said
yourself, it looks like just another walking mob, though a "strange" walk.
It all boils down to other users being more responsible instead of being so
quick to the drawl.  I guess. <shrug> :)

This goes for even if its NOT dotted.  Though, at times if you are out of
range for the health bar to be accurate, you are in most cases I believe too
far away to cast anyway.  If that isnt the case, then simply make it so
(directed to VI).

It IS stored on your computer if you run the /log then allow a parser to go
through it.  Thrid part programs are nice... I'm not sure if you have ever
run ICQ when it first came out, or hell, Windows... but as time went on,
they added and added and added, etc (you get the point).. now look at them
both (ICQ and Windows).. they are nothing more than bugged (more so directed
at Windows, pre XP) and most certainly bloated.  If I run a less bloated
version of Windows (say Win95) on a machine.. then run Millenium on another
machine that is an exact clone, hardware per hardware.. in most if not all,
things are going to move MUCH faster on the less bloated OS (Win95 machine)
than on the Millenium.

Perhaps then a they should have a "fishing line" recipe for tailors and of
course different qualities or line tests (5 stone, 10 stone, etc).  That way
only the line itself breaks, since afterall this could happen.  Though, when
I went fishing, if I actually was able to get one that could snap my line,
well.. I cut it.

;) I know.. I completely over-looked the "to get back to their bodies"

If you have plans to totally eradicate the spells once they are "upgraded"
then perhaps you should say "are ever used ever."  The word "consistently"
is a contradiction to your agreement with this idea. hehe.. Like I said,
just organize your spell book.  I mean come on.  Put the spells you DO use
either in the beginning or the ending.  Me on the other hand.  I know /book
35 will get me to my Improved Superior Camo on my druid and /book 12 will
get me to my gate/self port spells.  I know that /book 22 will get me to my
Divine Barrier on my Cleric.  Though, if I wanted I would position those
spells that I "consistently" use on pages 1, 2 and quite possibly 3.  Now,
just pretend the others do not exist, since they wouldn't anyway, if you
agreed to have them eradicated whenever upgraded. ;) Pleeease.. hehe. for
me, cause I for one am not "up" for that idea especially.

And the pain in the ass about it is.. this is all recorded.  What they DONT
want to say is that in more cases than none, SOMEONE has handed in an item
part of that quest (yes, I know some items in some cases would be considered
assinine to just hand in, but, dont put it past some people for a second,
just so that they can be "pricks") in essence MQing.  What happens when you
hand in duel items (or atleast that is how the NPC see its, since after all
its looking for a combination of items and ones that "grocery" list has been
fulfilled, here is your present).

That and of course, I won't say it doesn't happen, not for a moment.. the
NPC "glitch," more less.  Though, I assure you items you hand to NPC's are
logged.

As for the reasoning in cases that its a "glitch?"  Well, this comes to
their obvious inability to admit they are wrong (all the times they should
that is). :(

The hits are recorded.  As with who hit first, etc, etc.  Basically entire
hate lists, which result in once these hate lists are created, either:

1.  A dead NPC (once defeated)
2.  A dead PC or PC's (sucks to be them)
3.  A cleared hate list because all those that attacked said PC are either
dead or zoned.

Who and for how much is all recorded.  As well, GM's on "duty" or their
"shifts" will often call upon one another whenever a guild is fighting a
boss mob (which they later review all the hits and how they were
implicated)... which this can be done for -any- mob they wish.  This is what
assists them in deciding what changes need to be made to the game to suit
their "balance" of the "world."  <grin> If you say they need to start
learning how to read these reports in some cases... I whole heartedly agree.

Amen to that.. that it is.  though I sometimes (when Im not scheduled for a
raid or just plain bored off my ass and am in no rush to enter the game,
this is rare now) read it to see if the sneaky bastards changed anything
without notifying us as such.. which to make it binding, they have to, but..
Im paranoid, so leave me alone ;p

Yeah, but, running?  Its just a faster paced walk.  For this to happen, we
should in essence all actually be "born" and learn from the very beginning,
everything.  While this would be "neat" to some at first, I could see how
even I would consider it a major pain and a signal that VI was just milking
that bank account (the RL one that is). <grin>

LEAVE THOSE POOR TREANTS ALONE... ;p hehe

Question isn't how "hard" is it... but rather how "hard" it -should- be.
Sense heading doesn't take long to work up?  You better stop using those
trainer programs and that Thumper mouse clicking thing. ;p hehe

Bah.  Really should have had that other pot of coffee.  I missed another.
With THAT little tid bit I overlooked, it sounded as a bad idea at a VI
perspective, but, yes, if leveling isn't faster, they would essentially have
no excuse to not make this a possibility.. thanks for pointing that one out
to me. ;)

Shwew.. good.. lol ;p  j/k  I will be sure to be more careful now that I
know you are around to correct me. ;p  That and wont be up to the wee bit of
dawn to make replies.  Even though most of my reply went as it should have,
others made me look like an illiterate fool. <grin>
