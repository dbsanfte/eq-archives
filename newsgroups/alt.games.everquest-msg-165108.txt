    Humans do OK in games with skill trees where the generalist tank-mage is
more powerful than the specialist tank/mage. The real issue in class-based
games is, again, the multiple penalty. The wizards all start with lowish
offensive stats AND the weapons they can get are limited and lower-end AND
their combat tables come pre-nerfed.
