Maybe not with ME, but with 512Mb or more, Win98 can grab virtually all 
your memory as cache under default settings, then any app you try to run 
will promptly fall over or just hang the system completely. Just setting 
vcache settings in system.ini so that the max cache size is somewhat less 
than your entire amount of RAM will let you run happily with 512Mb or more 
though.

It only runs in the background to periodically grab back any spare memory 
that Windows isn't releasing back to the system. You don't actually need to 
use this feature. Cacheman also lets you perform lots of tweaks to your 
cache and memory management settings, and these are implemented as entries 
in your registry and system.ini files etc. You can fire up Cacheman, run 
through its wizards to tweak your system for your type of usage, then 
completely delete the thing from your hard drive if you wish - you will 
still have nice, optimized cache settings. Note that just getting cacheman 
to set some values in system.ini for vcache (i.e. running it and accepting 
its defaults in its cache wizards) will fix the problem with 512Mb or more 
in Win98.
