Is that a rant, a lament, an expose, a story, a guide or what?  What are you
looking for?  You want everyone to agree with you that EQ is boring at level
55? Or you want a pep talk?

Everyone has slumps in the game.  When that happens, some people quit, some
people take breaks, and some people just play through until things get
interesting again.

To be honest you picked a class that is in high demand, but is designed to
serve a very particular purpose.  You buff, you heal, and when healing
fails, you rez.  That's what clerics do.  After 55 levels of that maybe you
are getting bored doing the same thing all the time.

You say you are bored with the game, but seem unwilling to do the things
that would make the game fun and interesting again. Like learning to play a
solo character.  Soloing can be a lot of fun and it's a great diversion from
constant group play.  Talk about challenging yourself-it's all up to you and
what you attempt.  You don't have to depend on a group to pull fast enough
or pull harder MOB's, it's all up to you.  Not to mention that some of the
best solo classes also are great grouping classes (bard, beastlord, shaman)
so if you get bored with one way of playing you can try another.

Maybe you don't want to play a soloing character, so why not start a
completely different kind of character?  How about a Warrior?  Might be nice
to experience the game from the other side of the group.  Jump in to the
melee and mix it up a bit.

There are so many other things in the game you can do besides group and exp.
What about tradeskills and quests?  I took a break after I reached 50 and
spent a whole month just dong the Coldain Shawl quests and raising the
various skills needed.  I had a blast and it was a nice change from constant
leveling.

So anyway, if your bored and you really want to keep playing and not be
bored, then try something new and it should get interesting again.  If you'
ve really had enough of the game, then quit playing or take a break and play
again when you feel like it.  There are no rules, it's not all or nothing,
so play if you want to, and don't if you don't.
