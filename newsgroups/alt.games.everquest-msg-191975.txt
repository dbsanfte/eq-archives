As far as I know all Paladin stuns are unbreakable.  I've certainly
never noticed them ending early when I've cast them on mobs that
were being meleed (to be sure they're all pretty short duration
anyway).  But then Kaev has pretty much stalled out at L55 so I
haven't paid a whole lot of attention to higher level spells.

I never realized Whirl til You Hurl could be broken, but then I only
used it a couple times (my trio of puny Enchanters is led by a L17).
Anyhow, thanks for the info, it's good to know that mezzes aren't the
only breakable stuns.

As far as I have been able to tell stuns always generate the same agro,
whether they stick, or are resisted, or the mob's immune.  I've know way
to know that this is 100% true, but I've certainly used stuns to build
agro many times on unstunnable mobs.

Heh, after reading today's patch message I wonder if that's still true?

It helps that you get the immune messages nowadays.  Used to be that
somemobs (like most giants) you could tell because you would get the
message that they were stunned when obviously they were not.

Hmmm, sounds like learning all this first hand would be a first-rate
pain.  In my line of work, FM (----ing magic) is how we describe truly
evil hardware/software bugs (or, much more rarely, things that are
working that really shouldn't be).

Hmm.  Well if I were still interested in progressing with Kaev I'd be
asking you what spell he was using.  I think I'll just go rot some more
red cons with my Druid instead, I'm getting lazy in my old age and "easy
mode" EQ hasn't gotten old for me yet.

PoP again?

Not Burning Woods itself, Forest Giants.  I've stunned all three flavors
of them that spawn at the camp in the NE corner of the FV zone, for
instance.

Hmmm.  Back when I hung out in FM fighting the Mountain Giants they
were unstunnable by the spell "Stun" in the old-fashioned way (i.e.
you got the "xxx is Stunned" message even as the giant cheerfully
countinued chasing and pounding the Druid you were trying to pull it
off of).  Cease, Desist, Holy Might (Cleric dd+stun, Paladin gets it
at L49, I might be remembering name wrong), and Tishan's Clash (Wizard
dd+stun from a weapon proc) certainly all failed in exactly the same
way on higher level Mountain Giants in DL.

Thanks for the info.  I had no idea that non-mez stuns actually varied
in their ability to affect mobs.
