For the record, they NEVER said they could pass down
equipment from EQ to EQ2.

What they DID say was that if you owned both EQ and
EQ2, there would be an "heirloom" item made available
to you, (effectively as a trophy to say "I had a character
in EQLive who was THIS leet"), and it would be non-
unbalancing, most likely a house decoration item. Also there
was something about guaranteeing your name in EQ2, but
I've not heard about that bit of it since I read the initial
article.
