My vote is that there are a *lot* of zones you can fight xp mobs in,
regardless of your level. But if you want to group, you either need to
BYOG or go where everyone else is. Nowadays, that's Oasis, Crushbone,
Paludal, etc.

Imagine what it would be like to wander into Rathe Mts, frex, hear "Fire
Beetle valley needs melee", "Lizard camp 2, looking for one more" "Undead
tower camped", "North Giants camped", "Paladins camped", "Sphinx group,
needs healer". As opposed to what it is now -- 15 people, all 35+, fighting
over the giants and leaving the rest of the zone go to waste.

It's kind of sad, in a way. There are a lot of times I'll wander through
a zone, see some green (or red) mobs I never knew were there, and wonder
what it's like to camp them, and wonder if anybody does...
