Hi

I have a non fancy 9800pro with a AMD64 3400 and 1Gb of memory.

I had a lot of trouble with crashes in both 2d and 3d after I installed 
SP2!!

It overwrote my ATI 4.7 driver with Microsoft's 4.3 ATI driver, due I 
think to the Microsoft drivers having the later file dates. After 
rolling back, removing and flushing the system. Then I installed direct 
X9.0c then the 4.9 drivers, finally re-installing SP2  I have had 
absolutely no trouble since.

As for shadows no appreciable lag. But I turned them off as they are 
grotty and visually bugged to hell and beyond

The way they go through vertical surfaces so you can see the shadows on 
the walls on the outside of a building from the people on the inside the 
building!!

Then the shadows on people in buildings follow the sun outside not the 
lighting internally!!

Finally they are all the same shade of grey regardless of the 
surrounding light levels or even if the sun is behind a cloud!!

They will need a lot of work before I switch them on again.

I hope this helps
