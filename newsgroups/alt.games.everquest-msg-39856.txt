Ya, i did a spawn check and had a druid go to where the place he is suppose
to spawn, then i went to the that guy that gives the quest for the staff
which includes u to give him the belt, when i hailed him and tlaked with
him, the druid told me an orc spawned but he couldnt get to it even with
track, like it spawned under the world, then it killed itself, i did this
numerous times and the same thing kept happening, an orc would spawn but you
couldnt get to him then he would kill himself, ohwell i might write verant
and tell them about it, thanks for the replys
