*whew* just read about a hundred posts on groups LOL so I think I got a
pretty good idea of what my concept is:

1. Tank - warrior (hands down best tank)
2. Secondary tank - ranger (tracking, pulling, taunt), SK (taunt, pulling,
pet), Pally (taunt, lay hands)
3. Damager - monk (FD pulling), rogue (uber taunt)
4. Buffer - shaman (best buffs, healing, melee), bard (group buffs, minor
crowd control, melee)
5. Healer - Cleric (best heals, stuns, undead spells), Druid (healing,
snare, skins, DS), shaman (see above)
6. Nuker - wizard (nuclear bombs to finish off a mob), Mage (useful spells,
good DD spells, pet), Necro (DOTs, pet, snare)

I have found this formula for a ful group to be the most successful for me
so far.  Then again I havent done any planes raids yet.  And lately I am
rarely in a ful group.  Usually a 3-4 man pickup like follows:

1.  Tank
2.  Monk (Me)
3. Healer/Buffer
4. Caster

Tank needs to have hi taunt skill. These mini groups rock!  I went from
24 -27 at outer Paw in groups like this.  The only time I had full group was
when we went INTO Paw.
