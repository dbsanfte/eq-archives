Brad McQuaid stated, and later the tradeskills guy reiterated, that
WHICHEVER is higher amongst int or wis affects the tradeskill. So the
old thing that if you are an int enchanter to also raise wis for
success is a croc. You ONLY need one or the other to be high. 
They apparently help the possibility of gaining a point, though its
been said that whichever is higher may also affect success. In any
event its ALWAYS whichever is higher which makes sense because it
would otherwise be pretty unfair to Int casters if wis affected
success and int did not. So get ONE or the OTHER as high as possible
and it sorts it out.

The tradeskill guy stated for sure that Str affects smithing, its the
secondary skill.

Some players seem to think he stated that dex helps tailoring, but I
never found any concrete info about that.

No other ones are known or have been mentioned yet. Its important to
note here that they MADE str affect smithing then mentioned it, it did
NOT before that. So in other words shooting in the dark is pretty
useless, something either does or does not and they'd probably say
when they implemented it.

If you'd like to possibly become more confused about it than less by
reading the message boards and seeing how people think everything from
pausing every so often might help to standing on your head.

Ah ok though this bit is good, I guess the tradeskill guy DID confirm
to her about dex for Tailoring and Fletching:

"As of May 13, 2001, the following information was confirmed directly
to Niami, by Yakatizma (tradeskills developer at Verant) with regards
to stats and tradeskills. This is the MOST recent information we have
available, despite at least a dozen different message board threads
from folks trying to pull information from old threads, other sites,
etc. When we/I know more, it will be posted here, but please, in the
meantime, accept that this is as recent/accurate as it gets. Debate it
all you want, as Verant has been known to be wrong before, but please,
folks, don't expect me to re-re-re-restate this information in every
new message board thread that you feel like starting. ;) 

INT & WIS: whichever of the two is higher will affect skill increases
when practicing ALL tradeskills. The higher either your INT or WIS is,
the greater the chance you have for a skill gain while tradeskilling.

STR: higher strength will give you an added bonus to your chance at
gaining skill increases while smithing. 

DEX: higher dexterity will give you an added bonus to your chance at
gaining skill increases while fletching or tailoring.

CHA: higher charisma, along with faction, will affect your buying and
selling prices with merchants.

Stats have no impact on your chance of success or failure when
practicing tradeskills. (Only your current skill is supposed to impact
your chances of success or failure when creating an item.)

Yes, this is subject to change/debate, but until otherwise corrected
by Verant itself, this is the last official word we have on the
subject."

Oh and then this was added recently:

"According to the October 2001 Fan Faire in Orlando, the bonus for
secondary stats in tradeskills, such as STR for smithing, may not kick
in until the stat is 185 or higher. No further details are available."

Ouch
