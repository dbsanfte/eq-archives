Well, I believe that the login problem was mostly congestion, I had the same
problem at the same time, kept trying, eventually I got through.  Could have
been down for a while in there too, hard to say, but I suspect that everyone
that was dumped out of EQ, 99% or so of the players, was trying to get back
on at the same time.  I know of two people who did not go LD, both connected
through the same cable modem.
