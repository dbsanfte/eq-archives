I was going to jump on you there, but I see what you're talking about.
You're not saying it's "just in", you're quoting Casters where they
posted on 6/10 "This just in".

It is old news, which I think is what DTs reacting to. But I suspect
you were posting it to head off the inevitable "wtf" posts.

Unrelated...

I'm really fucking crabby tonight. I installed an update patch for one
of my programming toolkits, and it took 30 minutes to get Delphi
unconfused about package names.

Then I started getting weird system errors, and rebooted. My sound
card software (SantaCruz) quit showing the volume control in the
taskbar, and the Windows control panel sound applet wouldn't come up
at all. Had to screw around for an hour to fix that mess, including
downloading and reinstalling the SC drivers.

Then my hosting service is all buggered up tonight, so my web sites
are not working consistently and my email is completely down.

So here we are, and hour and 45 minutes after I sat down to start
programming, and I've only just gotten done dealing with a load of
crap.

Fuck.

Must remember to clean up my language.
