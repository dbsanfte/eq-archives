	I have always believed that a camp is a camp and the "play
nice'  rules just made rude people have an excuse for being even
ruder.  I think once you have claimed a camp its yours till you leave.
I have no trouble notifying you if you want a tell when I leave,  but
please,  if i get on early to camp an exp spawn or a rare spawn.  Then
you can wait for me to finish.  Usually 99% of the people are of a
similiar view and appreciate the tell when I am done.  
	I have had run ins with the share campers occasionally,  and I
find this is the best way to handle it.  I tell them theres a list,
and name off a few friends that are online. 8)  I tell them Ill put
them on the list.  I know... I know,  Its not nice, but come on, pick
another spawn.
