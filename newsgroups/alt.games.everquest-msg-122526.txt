I might add that you can cut down on the number of fizzles you have to
endure by casting the same spell more than once just in case:

/cast 1
/pause 80, /cast 1

That way if the first one fizzles, you will try again automatically.
If the first one is successfull, you will just get a "You have not
recovered yet" message on the second cast.
