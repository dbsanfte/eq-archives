If I pull an orc from Orc 1 in East Commons from a distance with a spell
or arrow, he can be guaranteed to bring many of his friends. This seems
to be true in all outdoor camps I've seen, but there are some dungeons
where this is not the case:

1) Kurn's Tower: I can agro a skeleton and drag it all over the place
without agroing others in the camp. It can pass directly over other
skeletons on the way to the pull point and they won't agro as long as I
stay out of their agro range.

2) Sol A King Room. Yesterday the room was populated with three Solusek
Champions. I opened the door from a distance, backed up and cast Stun on
the center gobbie. Only he came out. Same was true for the other two
Champions when they were pulled later.

3) In Sol B, a room with two Greater Kobolds. I cast Soothe on the one I
did not want to pull. It resisted (of course) and attacked, but his very
nearby friend did not agro.

In what other dungeons or areas have you seen this behavior?
