...and some at very low levels.

I always donate for SoW when offered by a lower level player. If a 70 
shaman drops one on me, I guess I just consider it more a professional 
courtesy. Not that I take them for granted by any means, but more like I've 
taken enough of their time already, and the mere 5pp I feel SoW is worth 
would be more of an insult than to merely thank them genuinely for their 
kindness.

I don't know. That made more sense in my head...
