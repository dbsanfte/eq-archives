> whats better, a wu's stick or a goranga club???

Wu's Trance Stick is a 7/18 with a Smite proc, goranga is a 12/23 with no 
proc.

Ratio on Wu's is 0.38
Ratio on Goranga is 0.53

The level of your monk weighs heavily into the calculations from here...

Not counting the proc, your compared modals (level assumed, 30, strength 
assumed 100) are:

Goranga : 1.08695652173913
Wu's : 0.833333333333333

This of course assumes that you have your 1hb skill maxed.

Around 40 or so the Wu's really steps up and gets much closer:

Goranga : 1.26086956521739
Wu's : 1.05555555555556

Generally, I find the proc of the Wu's to be worthwhile, and I would carry 
it primary from 35 on. Allocate your Goranga to your offhand and you will 
be set.
