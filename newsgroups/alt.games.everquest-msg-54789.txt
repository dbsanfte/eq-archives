I've had a thread on our server board and the Safehouse for the last week or
so about trying to convince VI to re-open Miragul's Highway (system for
firepot 'porting).  This is no firepot, but it's in the right line to reduce
the travel time/costs of casual players.

Maybe they've been reading it!


Incidentally, for the lower players in Iceclad, this could be a good way for
dealing with a bad pull... run to the gnome and get a ride back to NRo =)

I logged on yesterday just before noon to use a little free time to travel
to the mainland.  I got from the EW Ulthorks to Iceclad and swam to the
island.  I waited 30 mins for the raft, petitioned, and had to camp.  I
logged in last night, waited 20 mins, petitioned, got a fairly fast response
about the gnome way back on the docks.  No MOTD, though, no warning at all -
maybe Joshel the Large could have muttered something.
