I'm sure I'll give it a try, but to tell you the truth I'm not expecting
to get hooked.  I love the idea of a good SF MMORPG (I liked what little
I saw of AO, may go back to it), and I loved the Star Wars movies, but I
have a hard time believing I'm going to want to spend two or three hours
a day in that universe.  I think my tolerance for Wookiees, Ewoks, etc.,
is going to be pretty low.

Wow, look at the pretty margin!  And I didn't even try.
