Yeah, but my point is that even after rebooting and waiting 30 minutes
before reconnecting to my ISP, I still immediately get the 1018 after
selecting my character. I never even get into the game and it's kicking
me back to the Server Selection screen and a 1018. I don't even have a
fancy setup, just a single PC on a 56K dial-up connection. I know it's
not my ISP because even when EQ gives me this crap, I can do all other
normal Internet activity without a problem.
