I think that compeition as well as the item affects price.

eg, the merchant in sro by ortalus offers verry little for items.  Same way
with merchants in oasis, they charge and arm and leg for water.

Selling arrows to a merchant who sells arrows is a different price than
selling arrows to any other merchant.
