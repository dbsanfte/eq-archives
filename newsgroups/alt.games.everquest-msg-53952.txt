>>>they were going to delete all characters who were not played for like a
month and that were below level 2.<<<

>>>people with mules got panicky<<<

Proving once again that people are stupid.

Let's see .... notice that characters under level 2 not played for a month
will be deleted. Log in mule and play him for 10 minutes. Level 2 character
has been played, no risk of being deleted.

duh.
