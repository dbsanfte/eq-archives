Ahh, I see where you're going with this.  Remember he's going to
have to get to what, 39 for a 75 % rezz?  44?  So you may find that,
just to get him up to the level to do this you'd have to 2 box that
high.

Unfortunately no, what lull and it's relatives do is reduce
the aggro radius of a mob.  IE - if a mob would normally attack
you when you got 50 feet from it, lull will make it so you'd
need to get within 5 feet (made up numbers).  Long ago, before
they revamped Splitpaw to a 25+ dungeon, it used to be a 8-17ish
dungeon.  I got stranded down in the bottom with my bard when
I got disconnected and wasn't able to get back for an hour.

I was able to get out by creeping up the hallways and lulling
each of the gnolls then strolling right by them.

What lull doesn't do is erase the credit for the damage
you've done to it.


2 boxing a support class isn't terribly hard.  The key is
setting up hotkeys.  I do this with my cleric for my mage -

hotkey 1 is
/target Mairelon    (my mage)
/tell Mairelon [ %t ]

hotkey 2 is
/target Dhargo      (the cleric)
/tell Mairelon [ %t ]

hotkey 3 is
/target Goner       (Goner is my pet's name)
/tell Mairelon [ %t ]

Hotkey 4 is
/cast 1             (Complete Heal)
/g Complete heal on [ %t ] - 10 seconds

Hotkey 5 is
/cast 2             (Heal over time)
/g Celestial Heal on [ %t ] 748 in 24 seconds

Hotkey 6 is
/cast 3             (fast heal)
/g Remedy on [ %t ] hang tight

Hotkey 9 is
/target Mairelon
/follow

Hotkey 10 is
/sit

The others vary depending on what I'm doing.
I also have pauses in their (like 1 or 2)

So you can see, I don't even look at my other
computer (in fact they are on a KVM switch, so
I can't see both at once - I use a keypad to
control the 2nd comp when I'm on the 1st).

I just reach over and tap the 10 key
then the 3 key:

Dhargo tells you "Goner"

Then the 4 key

Dhargo says to the group "Complete heal on [ Goner ]  10 seconds"

I drew aggro
10 1
Dhargo tells you "Mairelon"
6
Dhargo says to the group "Remedy on [ Mairelon ]- Hang Tight

5

Dhargo says to the group "Celestial Heal on [ Mairelon ] - 748 over
24 seconds.

pet gets it back

10 3

Dhargo tells you "Goner"

In your case you have one less target.

I want to move, I just type 10,9 and he jogs
along behind me.

You might not want to do this in a group, but it certainly
makes "soloing" a lot more fun.

Heh, I'm probably going on a lot more than you needed :)

Blame it on a boring day.
