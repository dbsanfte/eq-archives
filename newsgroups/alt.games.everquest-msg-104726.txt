    I got a little queasy at the Freeport docks the other day.  A friend and I
were waiting for the boat, and she had to go AFK for a bit.  I suggested she
autofollow me first, so I could drag her onto the boat if needed.  She did so,
since we are friends, and she trusts me.
    Less than five minutes later, I accidentally scraped her off into the bay.
I jumped in in a panic and tried to drag her to shore, but to no avail.  A few
moments later I saw her hitpoints plummet, then her life bar grayed out
altogether.  And I started to have an odd feeling in the pit of my stomach....
