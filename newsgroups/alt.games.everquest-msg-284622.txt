I have a L10 ogre warrior on the Combine (progression) server.  Just went to 
look for the tome for my L10 discipline.  Allakhazam lists sellers in WFP, 
POK, and EC tunnel.  Theres no POK yet on this server, and they took out the 
vendor in EC.  Did they add a vendor for the 'evil' races, or is my only 
option to get faction up with freeport?  The tomes are no trade, and it 
doesnt look like the sewers come out anywhere near the vendor.
