There's no tic based marker on weapon swings in EQ1, unless they added 
it in the past month or so since I stopped playing.

With a long enough parse, you can detect a difference in weapon swings 
over time with as little difference as that between 41 and 42 delay.

Haste also affects weapon speed; with a /18 weapon and 70% haste you'll 
see a lot more than one swing per tic.  Again, it was not difficult to 
detect a difference between 70% and 75% haste.

When watching speed differences this small, it would be very noticable 
if there was tic based interference in the swing rate.
