You can theoretically get Kromzek and Tormax faction up without 
seriously thrashing another faction.  But I warn you, it is -very- 
tedious.  Camp the caves in Thurgadin... The goos occasionally drop dwarf 
heads that can be turned in to Captain Bvellos in the bank.  You may have 
to have him charmed (if that's possible, I can't recall :) It would 
certainly be irritating to hunt with him charmed if he had his GBS 
equipped...) This will give you sizeable +hits to Kromzek and Tormax, 
and only a small -hit to CoV.  It's about 200ish heads to get 
Kromzek up to Ally from Dubious, and probably more like 800-1000 to get 
Tormax up.  Kromzek is the good faction to have for exploring... most of 
the see invis giants are on that faction.  Very few mobs are actually on 
Tormax faction, and they're usually killed as soon as they spawn.  You 
-still- can't explore back in the temple of zek, though, as that's all on 
Guardians of Zek, or something like that, which there is no known way to 
raise.  Kinda like the Guardians of Veeshan in the North wing of ToV. :)

The Kromrif are bloody useless.  Tell them to get stuffed. :)
