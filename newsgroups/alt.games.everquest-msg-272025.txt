Little to no HP buffage, and crappy gear will do that.  Greater Healing 
is the spell I think, that's what, 300 to 400 hp?  A 57 enchanter with 3 
to 4k hp at level 57 would not be at all unusual.  Enchanters get squat 
for hp for levels, so most of it has to come from gear and buffs.  Most 
57 enchanters, other than serious twinks are not going to have access to 
really great gear.
