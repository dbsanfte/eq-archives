Langseax of the wolves  I recommend a druid or ranger to
help you track.  You will probably want to do this in a
group at 19.  Of the two mobs the one that drops the head
for the LoW as opposed to the Lang is a bit tougher.

You can also start your crafted quests.  Easiest is the
bracer most likely

You could also start looking up quests to raise steel
warrior faction to be able to do the Hero Bracer quest, when
you get a little higher.
