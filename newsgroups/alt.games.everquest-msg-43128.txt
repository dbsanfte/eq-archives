But that would require working papers in most states, which the parents
or legal guardians would have to sign. Then there's that whole problem
of getting up to the jail for the signatures when the the donut on the
front left side of the pick-up is flat. And since they built the
interstate, almost nobody drives past the old trailer park anymore, so
you can't even hitch hike there.
