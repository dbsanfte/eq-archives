They get to have fun.  There are things in EQ (and every other MMORPG I've
seen) that are incredibly fun the first time you do them, less fun the
second time, and downright boring the 10th time.  Twinking lets them go
through the boring parts faster.

I'd like to see them do something in EQ to speed this up...perhaps make
/testbuff available on the regular servers, to people who have a level 60 or
above on their account?
