Actually, it kind of makes sense that one of the (if not simply the) best solo
class is also pretty good in groups. Druids must be able to do a bit of
everything in order to solo well. Necros solo well, too, and with their
powerful DoTs (better than druid's) and built-in tank; they are also pretty
welcome in groups.

Again, the downside for druids is that, for every skill we have, there is
another class that does it *better*. Want damage over time? Ask a necromancer.
Want direct damage? Get a wizard. Want augmentation buffs? Find a shaman. Want
healing and defensive buffs? Humbly petition a cleric. Wizard ports are
slightly better (no sanctimonious guards at the landing pads) and there is no
druid spell capable of carrying a group to any of the outer planes (one would
think the Plane of Growth, at least, but NOOOoooo!) Need a tank? Don't even
bother asking us; even a mage is better at tanking (via her pet.)

Yeah, we are second best in everything. But find anyone else able to do
everything :-P
