Drop to 64 after two *ressed* deaths? That's pretty hardcore...

I try to stay three blues in, enough to take one death plus one
more during CR without un-dinging. It gets away from me sometimes
though...just last week I had a double death and was greeted by
the "DONG! Welcome to level 64!". Doh. Of course the rezzes
picked me back up. Most people I have talked to keep a bigger 
buffer than I.
