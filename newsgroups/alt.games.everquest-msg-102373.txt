I thought it was something like that yes.. But I had a full install,
so it should have been no problem.. But apperantely some files got
lost (well, actually a whole bunch of them).. 

Reinstalling everything worked tho.. I was already thinking about
that, but I wanted to know if anybody here had the same problem (it
takes so long to reinstall & patch everything)..
