Monsters really hate getting slowed.

Monsters don't like people who sit down.

If you want to do either of these, you have to wait until someone is doing
something that the monsters like even less.

Wait until the melee characters have done a bit of damage before you slow or
sit.  Or get a Shaman to handle the slowing...Shaman are more beefy than
Enchanters, so can take it better if the monster comes and beats on them.

I'm just guessing here, but I'd say haste is more important than slow in
this case, because hasting will help the melees keep aggro, and your group
was having trouble keeping aggro on the melees.

If you talk in game like you do here, it won't matter.  Mez will have long
since worn off by the time you finish telling the group about it. :-)
