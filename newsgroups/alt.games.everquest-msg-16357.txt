I was in a group up in the Pool Room in Sol B.  I was the puller,
and we had cleaned out all the Kobolds in the immediate area,
so I was running way down to around the Circle room for fresh meat.

I saw a Kobold running through, which was odd in itself (the spawns
there are stationary), but what the heck, so I got its attention
and ran back up to the Pool Room with it.

About 20 seconds later, there's a flood of new Kobolds coming
into the room.  Apparently the one I grabbed was part of a train
that someone had been running with, and by aggroing him, I had
aggroed the rest.  Oops.

Well, we had a good group so we gave it a shot, but then we noticed
that the Kobold Noble was one of the adds...

For those of you unfamiliar with hunting in Sol B, the Kobold Noble
is an Enchanter, and a real bastard.

He charmed me and the other tank, and we started beating the snot
out of our cleric and spellcasters.  They sensibly began to run
like hell for the zone line.

Now here's the funny part...   I knew that after the Noble and
his cohorts were done killing the rest of my party, he'd kill
me as well.  However, I was quite encumbered from fighting
there for a while, loaded down with Fine Steel and plat.  So
when the Noble and crew ran downhill after my groupmates as
they ran for the zone line, even though the Noble's charm was
directing me to run along with him and attack my groupmates
as they fled, I kept falling farther and farther behind due
to my encumbrance.

So by the time the Charm wore off, I was WAY behind "enemy lines",
all by myself -- the Noble and his gang were down by the zone
line (my friends had made it out safely), and there I was
all alone in the Carpet room.  So before they returned, I
hung a right and ran out the "side" exit tunnel to the Sol A
zone.
