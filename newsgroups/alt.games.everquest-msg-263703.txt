The group shared debt thing is interesting. It's designed to lessen the 
impact on someone who takes a fall for the group (e.g., an overpuller or 
resisted chanter), and in those situations I think everyone is happy to 
share it. But then you have a moron in your group who keeps dying 
needlessly, you don't feel too supportive of the system.

Here's something that ticks me off. When you're grouped you can click on 
someone's name in the group list and see where they're at relative to you. 
You don't see it on the map, you just see their name off in the distance so 
it's a very rough guide toward their location. People call it a waypoint but 
it's not. Anyway, sometimes when I'm selling scrolls in Antonica someone 
will group me so that they can see where I'm at and come to my location to 
buy a spell from me. I accept, and they start making their way toward me. 
Then I see their health going down and suddenly I get a message that I'm 
sharing their debt. Then they disband out of embarassment or frustration and 
all I've earned is debt. Ugh.

I haven't found out either, haven't had more than 3 shards down at any one 
time. I suspect you just stop getting any penalty, 5 shards being a pretty 
significant hit, probably equivalent to entering Uqua, stat-wise.

Well, I mean before you get your shard back. Check it out, even at low 
levels the debt is good sized right after the death, but goes down a lot 
once you get your shard back. Interesting thing about this system too is 
that there is no grace period. You get these death penalties at level 3 just 
as you do at level 20.

Yeah, I don't know either.  Worst I've heard came from a guy who ran and 
swam all the way to Freeport from Qeynos when he was like 10. He died 
several times, lost all his shards and said he incurred about four levels of 
debt. He logged out for 72 hours and played another alt during that time. 
Haven't seen him since though, so maybe he got discouraged and gave up.

Yeah, my worst debt has come from wipes, and they seem to be a *lot* worse 
than if I'd just died alone.

Wow, that sucks, wasn't aware of that dynamic. You should haven't to share 
the portion of debt that is associated with non-shard recovery, it should 
only be that portion that would remain after recovery. Only the owner of the 
shard should be hit with the non recovery penalty.

Group experience is lower per mob than solo, but faster of course because 
you're grouped. In general, you'll find that once you're in the teens you 
will still be able to easily solo, but you'll gain exp faster in groups.
