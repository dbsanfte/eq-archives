HS is the best experience in the game.   Just bring a full group (don't expect
to be able to add anyone once you're there).    Also, be prepared to spend a
great deal of time preparing to enter it.   A bare minimum of two and a half
hours of camping is required for each member of the group.   Half the time a
suggestion that we hit Howling Stones results in ending up in Ill Omen or
Kaesora instead : P

And bring an Evac'er, or your melees will be SoL when it's time to leave.
