Yes, I know what Optus@Home is, I live in Australia too. I am on Telstra
ADSL, and if I am VERY lucky I will ping 250ish, but on average I will get
300 ish. I know six or so other people on ADSL / Cable here in Adelaide and
they say the same thing. Now I know all the Optus users will say Optus is
better than Telstra, and that may be the case, but they arent good enough to
provide sub-50 pings. Also I work in the for ISP, and I will say it again,
there is NO WAY anyone from Australia is getting a ping to the EQ servers
that is below 50, like the previous poster has stated.
