I'd say the best guide is:

1) level

Spiderling silks etc are nice (going to hunt some rockhoppers and sell all
but flawless, then make boots and gloves and sell them) but the REAL money
is up at the top end, selling things like ornate patterns and molds. I have
a friend who solos the critters that drops them and he has millions of
platinum, sigh! Whereas as a low level (57) type, I am buying and I have
2000 plat to my name.

You want to be rich? Get high level, raid, when you have elemental gear you
can be a seller and you won't find a lot of things to buy unless you go for
a plat sink like tribute, casinos, etc. I can't see myself ever getting
there but I would say most people can commit more time in solid chunks, and
they should really aim for the elemental planes and forget about everything
else, unless you are using a macroing program to tradeskill i suppose.
