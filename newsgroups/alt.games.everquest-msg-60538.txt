I've played a cleric for most of my EQ career.  When a mob is mezzed, hate
still builds up from healing.  Yes, it's true a mob will agro a chanter if
it get's mezzed, but more often than not, the cleric has cast a few heals
during this time, and so now the mob hates the cleric even worse.  I know
this from experience.  As a cleric I would piss my pants whenever our group
had 4+ mobs mezzed and I was healing.  Once the mez dropped, my shiny armor
got dented.

And I've grouped with chanters who were focused on AC.  They had their
Defense skill maxed.  Had nice armor items (with high AC.)  And had shammy
buffs with AGI over 150.  And still, I saw these chanters get beat down to
chunky salsa when the Drolvarg Captain resisted his mez.  My healing spell
takes 4.5 seconds to cast.  (Superior Healing.) I didn't even have 4.5
seconds to save the chanter.  (I was 48th at the time, the chanter was 51st,
if I remember correctly.)

The moral of this story?  Chanters get beat down no mater what their AC is.

And as a side note, I've seen a LOT of chanters walk away from a group
because the tanks didn't know, or forgot to taunt a mezzed mob.  Teach the
tanks while they're young to taunt the mob first.
