True. 
Guk supported what, a dozen groups? Sol B 5-6? Oggok -- two, maybe 
three. Grobb, two.
Permafrost. Where would a group of 45's hunt there for experience? 
Goblins are green, giants inside can get very nasty. Giants outside of 
the Permafrost support maybe 2 groups.
Point is -- I do remember spending 3 hours and up on lists to experience 
groups. That means there were other people on those lists. That means 
there was not enough content available at high levels
