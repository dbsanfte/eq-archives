This time I knew it was coming. Ever since the higher-level people left
for Acropolis, Kryptic Rage had been on a downward slide. There were
efforts to recruit new people but the recruits didn't last, or didn't jell
into
a tight group of friends. Eventually my only remaining friend left and I
started looking at my character select screens with an eye toward the day
Adas came up untagged.
  That day was Wednesday. /who all Kryptic Rage has returned nothing
since then. I have to assume SOE declared us moribund and pulled the plug.
I'm a free agent again.
  How long should I stay like this? I have a hankering to work on my alts.
A mere few days could see Ada-P on FV server hit 37. Neuv should hit
Gunthak, then Dulak, and gain the ability to solo for some fun things. I
could have Rab do more of his epic, Ada-S do more VT shard farming,
Celune get into here 20's, and make that kitty BL I've been wanting to.
So many ways to have fun, and so much time...
  Or is there much time? It might be in my better interest to join many of
my old friends in Old Content, where the momentum seems to be right now.
OC claims to be about the older expansions - they refuse to do Luclin, will
only do planar flagging to get us geared up for the real stuff they want to
do,
and LDoN's only for AA's. Raid targets will be original, Kunark, and Velious
era. I'm hoping they can get Seb AE groups together for some mad xp.
  At the moment login servers seem to be clogged, but in a few days...
