Its a way of saying that.  However, it is normally a lie.  What it means
more often than not in a pickup group environment is "I can pretend to want
that so I don't have to random and hope to get it".

It also means "I came to this camp where I knew item X dropped which I
need, and will claim it on a NBG basis.  Oddly, you won't see me hanging
out at that other camp over there where item Y drops thats good for your
class.  If I did, I'd expect it to be randomed... but really, why should I
bother when I can camp only items that I will automatically get 100% of the
time, instead of ones that I can get 1/6th the time?"

Sure, for many of us it means "if something drops you can use, its yours",
but that merely puts us at a disadvantage against the people who DO lie
with NBG, either getting items that aren't actually upgrades so they can
sell them, or working things so they never camp items that aren't for them.

This is ameliorated to some extent by the fact that many mobs drop more
than one type of item, and items that are good for more than one class, but
still, in the end, its a serious edge for those willing to lie cheat and
steal.

Since thats the case, if you aren't among friends and Are concerned about
being ripped off, NBG is highway robbery.

That said, I usually go NBG, because I'd rather get ripped off than be
percieved as going against the grain, and I really don't care enough about
it either way to fight the good fight.  If I observe people being equally
nice about things, I often end up putting them on my friends lists; its not
the greedy person thats benefitted there, its me and the other non greedy
people.
