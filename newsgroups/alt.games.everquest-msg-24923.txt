Hi,

Created a cleric last night, dark elf of course :)

after i managed to loot some money to buy my DD spell strike
i noticed that it did 7dmg on more than one occasion, i was lvl 2
at the time, correct me if i'm wrong but did it not do like 4 dmg
until lvl 4 then do 5 dmg and so on?

/Regards Berth (Thotamon lvl 18 DE necro luclin)
