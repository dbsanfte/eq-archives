Tweety, or Sanya, as she's named for her duties in DAoC, was canned because
she had a website where she was openly insulting the playerbase.  She knew
that sort of thing was prohibited, and yet she kept it up until they got rid
of her.  For all your complaining about EQ's CS, would you really like to
find out that on top of all of that, you're also being mocked publicly on a
GM's personal website?
