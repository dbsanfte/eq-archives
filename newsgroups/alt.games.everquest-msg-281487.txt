Almost missing the point all together, ranger was using the wrong spell to 
pull with, not whether he should be using Jolt/Cinder Jolt which have the 
uncanny knack of not landing when you want them. I pull Creator very happily 
with any of the dispell magic line, not much difference in range and very 
easy to peel off by any tank class on the way back, plus has chance of 
knocking out a defensive buff at same time. A single arrow hit is more than 
enough to peel the mob off or the first opening barage of melee by your 
waiting tank. Carry a Jolt if you want, but a root spell is just as good to 
drop mob off infront of your tank to taunt or slap around.
