	Well, no.  Being stronger than other people doesn't make you any better
than them.

	Conclusions and opinions aren't knowledge though.  He would not be
infallible.  He could draw the wrong inferences, or adopt belief systems that
are out of touch with reality.  Like some commercial mud designers we could
name. :-)

|At worst, you have several beings of equal power in the universe.

	Maybe someone else can find a way to extend what is possible, or apply his
abilities in ways our guy hasn't thought of.  There's that fallibility thing
again.

	If there are multiple beings of the same type, perhaps I'm better off
signing on with one of them instead of this one.
