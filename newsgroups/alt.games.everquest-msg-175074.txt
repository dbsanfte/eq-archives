    Windstones for tailoring? You don't need windstones to do acrylia
tailoring.

    There's three paths to take at your skill level:

(1) Acrylia. Relatively expensive to buy in The Bazaar, trivials out low (at
least Studded does). The advantages are that you can do all the work in The
Bazaar and Shadowhaven on your own (assuming some Brewing and Smithing skill
on your part), and if cash is an issue there's some pieces that can be made
that still make money (at least on my server). You also have a high success
rate because of the low trivial point.

(2) Solstice robes. The cheapest per combine item the average person can
make, takes you all the way to 250. Almost all the items required are
available in The Bazaar, all if you can imbue emeralds. The robes also sell
very well, even today. The disadvantages are the extreme time required to
gather components for combines, the possible requirement of hiring an
emerald imbuer, the difficulty of getting gem enlaid chains, and the low
success rate at lower skill. Depending on how expensive chains and imbuing
are, though, you should still be able to cover costs well - /hug 5% minimum
success rate.

(3) Velious tailoring, in particular arctic wyvern tailoring. The components
that need to be hunted are in higher supply in The Bazaar than for acrylia
tailoring, and sell for less. The disadvantages are poor sales (most of the
pieces are crud), having to go to Thurgadin to make bonings/studs, and a
poor success rate to help pay for supplies. There's also the massive hidden
cost of coldain tempers when making any item that uses studs.
