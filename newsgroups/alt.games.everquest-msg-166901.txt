I agree with what you are saying here.  The situation that made me
question if the genoid's is a camp is that there was a single wizard
near the bottom of the hallway at a specific spot.  It was just us in
the whole zone.  It looked as if he was medding.  It looked like he
killed two  before he was OOM.  I ran all the way to the top of the
hallway and must have passed 5 genoid's by the time I got up there. 
He certainly was not holding the spawn rate.

Right.  Just like I mentioned above, he really didn't have the hallway
cleared at all.  I've seen other players that can legitimately solo
the entire hallway in a short amount of time and control all the
spawns.  When I ran to the top I saw the gem collector so I decided to
kill it.  I invis'd past the Wizard so he didn't see me pass him. 
What he doesn't know can't hurt or bother him.  It was a tough fight
as a Level 40 Bard.  There were times I had to mez it just so I could
heal myself. The risk was worth the reward.
