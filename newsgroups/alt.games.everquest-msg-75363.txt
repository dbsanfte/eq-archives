I'm sorry, but "Jobner" is not a blank canvas, it's a stupid name.  And if
you're the type that thinks that said silly name is cooler than it is, then

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
