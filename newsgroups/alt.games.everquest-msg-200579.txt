    No, as last time I checked you earned no XP by Ranger Gating to bind or
hanging out in the GY, waiting for your corpse to drop from the sky.

    Yes, it does. Even beyond the blindingly obvious "it kills you faster",
it requires you to gear up your character to a greater degree than other
areas of the game. Thus, you must have spent more time playing effectively
to XP there than if you picked another area to XP. Even in your philosophy,
more time = harder.

    Plus all lost opportunity costs of waiting for the corpse, plus all lost
opportunity costs of organizing a group that can have success in that more
difficult area. Remember all those people in line to do trials? Ask them if
all they lost when they lost a trial was 4% of the experience deducted for
death.

    And entirely relevant if he's right and you're wrong.

    Newest wizard recruit: FULL AA's, and that means all of them, plus 30
banked, plus 99% done the 31st point. He still goes out and does XP. He
replaces the XP lost on raids, he powerlevels friends, he kills
blues/yellows/reds that also drop items he can sell/use. The necromancer he
was in a contest with also has full AA's. At least one enchanter in my guild
is over 400 AA's, as was a warrior that recently went to another guild. They
all still do XP with groups, regardless of the utility of getting Improved
Charisma IV or whatever crap they buy once they're that high. They want to
say they have it all, and they enjoy playing the game.

    Perhaps if XP wasn't slow, it wouldn't be that uninteresting for you.
Maybe calling for XP nerfs isn't the way to bring enjoyment back into the
game for you.

    Another guild necromancer has been farming Nadox for the past month and
a half, earning the odd AA point and a lot of sellable loot (he's after a
charm). He's very psyched about the upcoming XP change, because it'll make
the entire zone light blue or solid blue and he'll be able to use it as an
XP camp AND a cash farm. Before the change, he was going to get his charm
and leave; after the change, he's going to stay and farm the living shit out
of the place. He's not the only one thinking this way.
