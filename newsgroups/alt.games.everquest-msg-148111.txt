I think force feeding/drinking yourself halves the natural lifespan of
the food/drink but it definitely stacks so say:

1 store bought flask of water would last 5 minutes naturally.
1 store bought flask of water would last 2.5 mins chugged down.
5 store bought flasks of water would last 12.5 mins chugged down.

Around 5 seems to be the amount I can chug/eat before I get the
"explode" message so that's the maximum amount of time you can assume
your stat drink/food is safe in the top slot before having to do the
trick again.
