Actually, although you can no longer see the number of players on a
server, you can see the population rank. If you still have the setting
marked for population, then the servers with the lowest amount of player
population will be at the top of the server list, and most populated
servers at the bottom.

Thus, you'll notice that the PVP servers, and the Role Playing server
are the least populated servers and are at the top.
