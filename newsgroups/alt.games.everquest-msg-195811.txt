There'll be banded mail for sale in the first two hours.

Then, when enough players have farmed the lower level mobs for plat, and
bought the banded, there'll be plate for sale very quickly after that.

Yeh, but the camps are already so well understood, that a 'guild' of folk
can raid say Ak'annon, kill the Minotuars, get that axe, and still get it
before they normally would.

I started on one of the European servers, no initial movelog, and within a
few weeks this was not the case.  You have to consider the people who play
characters in rotation, who can spend 24 hours doing nothing but levelling
a druid the hard way, but then use that druid to level a bunch of other
characters, and use those characters to level other characters, etc., etc.

It was slow when the first servers came out, because people didn't know
where to get stuff, didn't know where the easiest good loot was.  You can't
put that knowledge back in the box - and it will result in a race to be 65
first.

It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying.
