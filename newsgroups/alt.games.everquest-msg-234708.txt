Yep, that's about as far as many mages go with aggro management!  In
addition, these same mages seem to think the rest of the group all
*love* Rooted mobs...  :D  Use the Water pet, dammit!!!

Bought 'em all, and very useful too.

Heh, this is another spell I like  :)  My 32 mage also has 100 Bind
Wounds, too which (if I recall) is as high as non-melee's can take it.
It always saves the healer's mana if people can bandage to 50% during
a lull.  That said, it is AMAZING how few melee-types bother with Bind
Wounds skill, at least in my experience, anyway.
