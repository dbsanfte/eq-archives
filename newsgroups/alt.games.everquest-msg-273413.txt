Hard to say. I've resisted buying OoW so far, but I'm missing out on 
groups and drops. It doesn't take long in the modern EQ before you'll be 
able to group in OoW... or missing out on groups because you don't have 
it.

Furthermore, the box propaganda for oow has enough vagueness to suggest 
that its relevant to all players, not just high level ones. And most 
gamers know that in multiplayer games you generally need the latest 
expansion if you want to find other players to play with.

DoN, on the other hand, if its successful, with its guild tools could 
very well become a defacto requirement, just as PoP's PoK was... even to 
players who would not see even the Plane of Tranquility for another 
year.

Around here:

EQ is 19.99
OoW is 19.99
DoN is 29.99

EQII is 34.99

Even not including DoN, EQ2 is cheaper around here.

The value of more content is highly disputable. Most of its obsolete, 
most of its abandoned.

Good luck with that :) It can be done, but its a herculean effort.

Meanwhile in EQ2 at least the content and focus is still geared towards 
you the lowbie/newbie. And most of the playerbase is in your level 
range...

Many potential players know all this, factor in that EQ2 is newer, and 
cheaper, and more likely to get future expansions than EQ1 is...
