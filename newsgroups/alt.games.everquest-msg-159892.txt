Here's how procs work, according to one source:

A given proc checks on a regular timer (each weapon uses a
different timer for its proc)

BUT it only checks on the next swing after the timer is up.

So say you have a weapon that might proc once every two seconds,
and a delay of 4 seconds.  The weapon will proc at best once
every four seconds, since its only checking at that interval.
Now get a haste such that you are swinging every three seconds.
Weapon will check proc, then check proc in three seconds, and so
forth; your proc rate enjoys the full effect of the haste.  Now
get more haste, such that now the thing is swinging every two
seconds.  Still get full haste results there.

Try another weapon.  This one has a proc timer of two seconds and
a three second swing timer.  Proc check every three seconds.
Haste to two seconds, proc check every two seconds.  But haste to
1.5 seconds, and things get funny.  Check proc, then next swing
don't check proc.  Next swing check, next don't, so on and so
forth.  Proc rate can be worse than 2 seconds (if swing is worse
than 2 seconds) but can't be better no matter how fast swing
gets.

Figuring out what the proc timer is on various weapons would be a
challenge, of course, but something along these lines might help
figure out whats going on with the proc and hate mystery
