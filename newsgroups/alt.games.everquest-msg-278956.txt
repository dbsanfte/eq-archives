That is one of the key features I like, and didn't even think about it
until this morning.  After waking up way too early, but not really
enough time to do anything else, I hit Delving before work.  It was
great that it was just a short run to the teleporter and I could do
something productive while waiting until it was a more reasonable time
to wander into work.

I like the fact that it will be there to do that no matter what level
that character is.
