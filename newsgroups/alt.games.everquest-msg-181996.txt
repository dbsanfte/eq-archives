Why would you (LC, not you personally) care if they teamed up or not?  The
only reason I can fathom is that you would believe this will hold them from
gaining access for longer than otherwise.

The real issue I see here is that them gaining access, and using that access
the way they do is blocking you, LC, from further progress.  If you knew
this would happen ahead of time, why reach an agreement at all, if you did
not know, why would you care if they teamed up or not?  You specifically
state that the no teaming up clause was insisted upon by LC.
