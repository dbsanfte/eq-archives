Remove the hordes of hi-levs flooding the bazaar and what exactly would 
you buy there that was 'better than level-appropriate'?

It bears directly on your claim that you've got 'great gear for [your] 
level without the help of a single person'. The truth of the matter is 
you've got 'great gear for [your] level' with the indirect help of 
several hundred people who are much higher level than you.

I'm not criticizing you for it, its a legitimate part of the game, but 
don't kid yourself; you didn't get it on your own. The first wave of 
players did, and the people who play boycotting the bazaar might be... 
but you relied heavily on others to get your kit; you just don't know 
they're names.

If we reduce it to a personal level: you hunted 60 lq cat pelts and then 
gave them to hi-lev Gogomon in exchange for his services to penetrate 
Lower Guk and bring back an FBSS for you (or whatever). I call that 
having substantial help from higher level players.

The only difference with your technique is that its more 'efficient' to 
use the bazaar than rely on the barter system.
