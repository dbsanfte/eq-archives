This is only an issue if the mobs are so "inappropriate to your level"
that they're now light blue or green.

That's an invalid comparison -- as long as they're not green/LtBlue,
you get exactly the same number of exp points for killing a level 43
mob at level 55 as you do at 51.  The AA movement should be identical,
per kill.

I think the problem is his memory.  I certainly don't recall getting
anywhere near "a full blue" of exp from 4 kills at 51.

This much is true, blue cons now give about 75% of the exp they used to
give before the patch.

Yes it is.
