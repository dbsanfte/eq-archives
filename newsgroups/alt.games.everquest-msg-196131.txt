I too have a now almost lvl 6 DE Mage on Stromm...  :)  WOOT!  That DE Newbie
armor is a DRAG to get... LOL  I guess that is what happens when you can't
bring out your main to go kill the stuff and then loot it with your
newbie...hehe... :)

Having a GREAT time!  Love the chaos that surrounds the over crowded Newbie
Zones...  

Am now off to EQ atlas and Alla to read up on that Befallen quest... hehe
