*chuckle*  When my first couple characters were in the 10 to 15 range
the LFay Bandit and Nybright Sisters camps were among the most
contested on the server.  Back then most folk didn't stray too far from
home until they were forced to, and that was (?still is?) the best loot
available on Faydwer for those levels.  Probably quite a good even
nowadays if you've got no competition.
