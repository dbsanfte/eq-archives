Think of it as a monk switches to a 2hb while the warrior next to the monk
is still using his 1hs weapons.
Lets say the monk scores 2 hits of 50 and 63 points on those 2 hits.  The
warrior in basically the same amount of
time using his 1hs weapons would scare say; 35, 32, 28, 31.  The  monk does
113 points as opposed
to the warriors 126 points.  Now expand that out over a short time and the
warrior soon has agro again.
As you also stated this is ignoring, weapon procs, kicks, taunts, etc
because this is just a look at the ratios
of DPS per weapon categories.  So kind of answering your question is
switching the weapon types changes
the damage ratio each toon is doing per tick, thereby allowing the warrior
to regain agro.
