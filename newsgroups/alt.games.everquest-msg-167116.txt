Oh this is the best one yet ...

I'm quitting EverQuest. I can't stand that asshole Hatekiller anymore, I
hope he's satisfied that he's driven me off.

Besides this, you should all know that there are martians planning to invade
the planet earth.  I have to start preparing for this onslaught, so I don't
really have time to play EQ anymore. If you'd like to stay safe yourself, I
suggest that you cover your head in tin foil so that they can't get you with
their brain interception rays.

I hate this game. It's so unfair. I'm never, ever coming back, so fuck you
all. Especially Sandcrusher. Fuck you.

Love and kisses,
Borisdatroll
