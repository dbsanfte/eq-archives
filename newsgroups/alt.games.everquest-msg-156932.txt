You may want to look at coldain skin gloves and coldain skin boots.  They
arent expensive either and have decent stats.  My 58 cleric is still wearing
them.  Maybe get a Goblin Soul Caller for your neck, and possibly a belt of
the Cenobite.  These arent huge upgrades...  But they are pretty nice...
and dont cost too too much.
