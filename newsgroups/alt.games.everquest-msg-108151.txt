    Always a good policy to have.  I remember my surprise
the first time that happened to me.  I was level 16 shaman
at the time, being invited by a level 3 rogue.  I was way
red to him, of course.  Did he think that perhaps I could
power level him by hunting baby mammoths?  Did he want me to
watch his health while he battled bear cubs and
spiderlings?  Did he just want to hang around me because of
my (character's) gravity defying breasts?  I dunno, because
he never did say a word to me. 
   It doesn't happen often, but when it does, I just assume
that the inviter (new word!) is at the very least, being
rude and not worth grouping with.  Even if they are of a
reasonable level to join up with.  They don't have to buy me
dinner or take me to a movie first, but they do have to at
least say "Hail.  Wanna join me?"
