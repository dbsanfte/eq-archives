[snipped good post about enchanter worries]
Except from the part about mezz macros it could have been written by me.
It lists all the reasons my chanter is more or less retired for.
The only thing it does not list is the damn boring exp groups afraid of
pulling more than one mob at a time and running screaming to zone when
it happens. It usually leaves me with two mobs mezzed in camp waiting
for them to return. :)
Since it doesn't get better with the lvl65 crowd I don't regret
switching to bard. I have similar tools and it doesn't bother me when
someone is just to dumb to grasp the concept of /assist. Bard Songs
don't generate as much aggro as enchanter spells. So I'm seldom the one
getting the beating after somebody choses to hack away on a mezzed mob.
And it doesn't cost me 300 Mana for a single mezz. :)
Don't get me wrong I love being an enchanter in a good group. Such a group
can pull of amazing things. I don't mind the occasional death. It
happens. But the usual pickup group just don't know how to deal with an
enchanter. Or just utilize him/her as slower only. *yawn*
