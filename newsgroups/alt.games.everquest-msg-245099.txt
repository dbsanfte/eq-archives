While we're at it, let's get rid of different zones, classes, and MOb
models too. Everybody should be running around East Commonlands
(renamed just Commons) killing bigger and bigger moss snakes to level
65. The little ones could be on the east side, the big ones on the
west side. And, you could work left to right as you progressed.
Against the west wall would be the raid level MObs--huge moss snakes
with half a million hit points that quadded for 4,000, had an
unresistable 3,000 point AE, and kicked for 1,200 in order to maintain
the original vision.

Or, maybe that's a horrible idea and variety is a good thing.
