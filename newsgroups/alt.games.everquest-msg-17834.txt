Well give us your ideas and we'll see what we think.

Try to avoid the dumb ones like Dabasher, DaMezzer, Danuker etc or anything
that makes a sentence.
Bards always seem to have clever names (ones with musical overtones but
aren't too obvious) or Stupid names (ie pop and rocks stars or Bands, Axl,
JonBon or missplellings of them the worst I've seen is "Amusician" hope he
loses that one) but for some reason they are forgivable on Bards, almost.

Everyday I see more and more stupid names while in EC. Mules called
Myecmule. People using the letters EQ followed by a slang term for their
class (Eqtank)
Rogues called things like Stabsya Inderbak, the list goes on.
Hard to role play with a Warrior called Imatank or a Dwarf called
Whaaaaazuuuup <sigh>

CF
What do p.a. play, btw?
