OK, is 5M enough?  2M?  Whats your cleric's average mana?  Thats the rough target.  I don't
believe it mind you, are you really claiming that you never ever pay any heed at all to your
cleric's mana?  Cause if thats the case you might as well not bring a cleric along.

Flexible will win more fights?  The lower your healer mana is when you pull, the less room
you have for disaster.  At some point, its not going to be enough.  You aren't being
flexible, you are being inane.

And when they happen, you die, the girl dies, everybody dies.  And its your fault.   Because
for no advantage other than a couple minutes over an hour's run, you have been running
around with a tiny mana pool on your cleric.

OK, if you don't sit around, neither does group B.  Because by definition group B does
exactly, exactly what you do.  If you pull at 20M, they pull at 70M.  If you pull at 10M,
they pull at 60M.  If you pull at 0M, they pull at 50M.  They always do exactly what you
do.  Except of course, wipe OOM because their idiot puller thought "oh thats enough"

Whatever you do, they do.  So stop trying to say that what you do is going to make the
difference.  If it isn't "have less mana" then it doesn't count for the purposes of this
discussion.

No, I'm trying to point out an alternative to your trying to make the arguement that 20M is
better than 80M.  You keep trying to somehow make it so your group's mana regen rate is
higher, but by definition for the purposes of this arguement it isn't higher.  You keep
trying to somehow make it that your group moves faster, but with the sole exception of
whatever it was you did to initially get to 30M, it isn't faster.

If you can prove otherwise, you have an arguement, perhaps even a winning one.  If you
can't, then the alternatives are that you are either a troll, or just a poor loser, unable
to admit defeat.  The latter seems more likely, trolls generally spell more poorly and don't
have this much in depth knowledge of the game at their beck and call to try wriggling out
from under with.

Or "you lose".  Come on, either return the volley or hop over the net and shake my hand like
a good tennis player.  No shame in it.

Its not a question of the next mob, its the next 60 mobs in a row.  You aren't pulling LOM
just this once, its continuous, its policy.  And you aren't getting mobs any faster than
group B, remember, they are pulling at exactly the same rate as you are, and we've bribed
the employees at SOE to see to it that they and the mobs get all the same rolls.

There's exactly one point at which group B waits while group A pulls, and its the period
during which group A goes from 80M to 30M.  To make matters worse, you claim that that magic
point happens outside the dungeon itself, instead of waiting for FM, your group actually
enters LOM.  Zoning into a situation where you don't know what mobs are going to be there,
who in your group is going to zone in slowly, who is going to go LD (and we've seen a lot
more LD on zoning post LDoN patch) instead of taking a completely safe couple minutes to med
up just in case the worst happens when its the most likely to do so?  Doubly zany, and it
throws away the only advantage group A had.

Then I just don't care about your methods.  Do you care to continue with the discussion of
what would happen if your group was equipped with normal gear, and/or had only 4 members
instead of 6, and/or was doing "difficult" instead of "normal"?  In other words, if there
was any challenge to them for you at all that wasn't due solely to your own personal uber
tactics and skills?

I start at 80M, you start at 30M.  If I do exactly precisely what you do, I'll never ever go
under 50M, because I'll be spending the same as you, and you can't ever go under 0M.
Remember, my group has exact clones of your group, with identical play styles, and all our
rolls come out exactly like yours.  The mana will indeed keep flowing in, but for my group
just like for yours.  Except that when you go OOM, my group has more mana LEFT than your
group had when you pulled.

Group B pulls at 80M and finishes the next fight at 85M.  They pull at 85M and finish at
90M.  If they've gotten up to FM (which is annoying) and drop to 70M or 80M on a tougher
fight, they are just as ready to keep pulling as you are.  Identically, completely just the
same amount ready.

How can you not see that this pull rate is not just sort of the same, but exactly identical
to your pull rate?  It is just that, BY DEFINITION.

Stop trying to evade the central issue; pull rates are the same, mobs die just as fast,
everything, everything everything is the same, with three exceptions.

1) group A stays under 50M, group B stays over 50M, unless a disaster needing more than 50M
occurs, in which case group A wipes and Group B is fine

2) Group A pulls faster than group B for a few minutes at the beginning of the mission,
unless of course they Entered the mission already LOM

3) Group B runs the risk of hitting the FM bar 50M sooner than group A, if pulls are so slow
that they actually can't keep a roughly steady pace.  On the other hand, if this occurs,
group A is violating the agreement that they are going to stay under 50M (which is average
around 30M, as surely nobody is pulling at 5M)

I don't think there's any real risk of that though, given your aggressive stance on pulling,
it doesn't sound like your group ever gets over 50M without deliberately doing so.  If you
DO stop to med up past 50M, Group B simply pulls when reaching  near FM instead of waiting
while you med the rest of the way to whatever your goal was going to be, and so makes up
that much of the time they lost when you stole a march on them in item 2)
