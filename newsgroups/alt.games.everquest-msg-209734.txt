I have a Gnome Wizard, lvl 9, and I just tried the first armorquests
from GM Xalirilan. Im supposed to gather 4 things, Ive done that.
Those things are supposed to be combined in "Assembly kit", then put
in sewing kit.......

Is assembly kit and sewing kit same thing? I got a Thinkered sewing
kit from GM, but when I try combine the things, it just says it can�t
be combined in this container......

The intruction more precise says:

You say, 'I want to craft a bracer' 

Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'Bracers are a wise idea and will keep
you well guarded young Celebus. 
To create your bracer material you will need to combine 1 Grikbar
Kobold Scalps, 1 Plague Rat Tail , 
1 Minotaur Scalp and a Cloth Wristband in your assembly kit. Once you
have created the proper material
 take it to a sewing kit along with this pattern to fashion your very
own Bracer of the Collective Initiate.'  
Reward(s): 
Bracer of the Collective Initiate

I found out htere are som different types of Assembling kits:

but wich should I use?

Ive tried just about anythin for a couple of hours now, just can�t get
it to work, please help!
