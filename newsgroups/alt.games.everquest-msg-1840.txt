I always hated kiting. I usually use Ensnare then nuke to half or one third
depending on the difficulty of the MOB then damage shield and melee.

I still melee at 38 but its getting harder and harder and it depends on the MOB
and how tough they are.

A really mana efficient way to kill for me has become Root/Ensnare/ DOT/DOT
and then I sit and med till the dots or the root runs out then I recast and sit
back down. It has made it almost too easy since root and snare stack now.
