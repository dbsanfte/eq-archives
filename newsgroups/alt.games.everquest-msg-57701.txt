I'm in Canada and we have a lot of people from other countries.  No one
walks up to them in the mall as they talk to each other and say, 'Hey,
you've got to speak English so that we can understand a conversation that
we're not even part of.'

I'm sure if they've got something to say that they want you to hear (ie.
Train!) then they'll switch to English.

I'd just as soon 'hear' someone speaking Cantonese or Swedish in OOC than I
would D3wd1sh.
