Son there are some things in life you are gonna have to learn the hard
way.  One of them is that there is no rule book that lists every
possible thing you can and can't do.  Sometimes you'll need to be able
to look at the big picture and figure things out for yourself.  This is
one of those times.  If the developers had intended for guards to kill
things for you so you can get the exp w/o intended risk we each would
have our own assigned guard at creation to do just that.  Play the game,
earn your way or be a lazy scum bag exploiter.  You choose, I don't care
what you do myself, but you should.

btw, the non fact rule I didn't quote has actually led to disciplinary
action against several accounts that I am personally aware of.  Not bad
for something that has no basis in fact eh?  Sort of makes you wonder
about that claim you made that the only offense one could commit 
involving a guard would be to train it on someone.  Does it make you
wonder about what else you don't understand?  It should.

th
Interestingly enough, spellcheck insists that scumbag should be scum
bag.
