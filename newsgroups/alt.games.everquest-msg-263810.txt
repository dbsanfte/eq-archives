Well, given that I don't watch TV when I play EQ, that is not my 
complaint.  I do like the idea that you can, based on "skill", get 
different results from using the components.  I just don't like what I 
have seen described of the way they chose to implement this.  I am not 
sure that I could suggest a good way to implement it.

/hug Hammer of the Ironfrost

I should note that you don't have to apply yourself to the mind numbing 
tedium of farming ingredients in order to become a GM in most any 
tradeskill, there are plenty of folks who are perfectly happy to do that 
part for you for a price, leaving you with just the mind numbing tedium 
of clicking combine, autoinventory...
