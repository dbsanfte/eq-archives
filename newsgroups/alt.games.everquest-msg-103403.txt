Had the shield at 35, and boots by 40... up to Kirn now... the joy of
it all.  Have never had a spirit not talk to me for level, but HAVE
had them not respond due to faction.  And after shield of Falsehood,
there are no more gems involves, so it is all faction based on
actions..... latest example - before I turned in the combined 6 pages
to the spirit in the tower in EJ, went to the one in the lake to con
faction, and hailed it repeatedly.  No response.  Turned in combined
journal, and the reaction was immediate.  This at 52.

Got real lucky on the Ghiosk books..... one of the 01_uberguilds was
beating on reavers, and pulled Ghiosk out, and sent tell to zone that
it was first come, first loot... I was a happy camper.

And your epic'ing a lvl 1 would stop as soon as CoM came up, unless
you actually planned on taking him in there.  The combine on the 6
journal pages/merchant letter/etc are definately no drop.
