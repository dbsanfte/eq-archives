Gaaaaah!
1) Where did the ports go?  What happened to them that you need
something to take their place?  Stop.  Take a deep breath, and
think this through all the way.  Some Druids charged individuals
for ports <to> some places, many other Druids found it very
annoying to be presumed to be a taxi-for-hire by other players.
Many Druids help out guildmates by porting them <to> places, and
although some bore this burden gladly that does not make it less
of a burden.  These <non-group> burdens are what the PoK ports
have superceded.  While a Druid's porting capability means that
her group could get <to> places more easily, the really big edge
it gives is that they can get <from> any place back to a safe
place or a gathering place or a staging area quickly and easily,
and that a group could try to escape a situation gone sour before
they wiped (via evac).  These last two, the most valuable part of
your porting ability from a group's perspective, are not even
remotely affected by the PoK ports!  And your ability to get your
group <to> a place where you want to be is actually simplified by
the PoK ports because most anybody can get to PoK quickly, no more
port/med/port/med/port/med to gather the group.  So, you have lost
nothing of real value.  No harm, No foul, Play On!
2) There are 14 or so classes in EQ.  There are 400,000 active player
accounts, according to Sony.  I would be very surprised if less than
100,000 of those active accounts include a L29+ Druid.  I don't know
about you, but I do not want my in-game "identity" shared by 100,000
other players.

The attitude you describe is 90% of what it takes to be valuable to
a group.  The other 10% is a natural consequence of actually playing
as if that were true.  The key is that, rather than deciding what is
good for the group, you observe, adapt, follow when appropriate, lead
when necessary, and don't hesitate to speak up when things seem to be
"broken" (not the way I speak up here tho, tact and discretion work
lots better than sarcasm and venting, heh).  It sounds like you already
know this, but for some reason fastened on your group ports as a sort
of security blanket that validated you by making you seem obviously
useful.  get over it.  If you play with the attitude you described
above you are a valuable member of any group worth being a part of.

Passive Druids are not useless, but they aren't (usually) nearly as
valuable as active Druids.  Pulling is good, it takes advantage of
some of your special abilities.  Spot healing is reactive, sometimes
necessary (and it is important to do whatever is necessary).  But
Druids are better at hurting than healing, and you and your groups
are gonna do better if you adopt tactics that take advantage of that.

Pull/fight/med/pull/fight/med/pull/fight/med/GoStarkRavingLooney!!!
I manage to tolerate an xp grind about once a month (I've had the
same "main" character for over 3 years, still only L54).  There's
one whole helluva lot more to EQ than grind groups.  Even the raiders
recognize this, tho they're so obsessed with taking out "the next
target" that they grind like madmen to gain levels and AA so they'll
get tougher so they can advance to the next target so they have to
grind so...  As you can see their approach looks to me like just
another variation on the grind (I left out the "pharm the mastered
targets for loot" part that is also a big deal for them), they like
it tho, and it's their time.  Anyhow, depending on the group and
what you're up to, you don't necessarily have to spend all your time
parked on your ass.  /ramble off

Why must you have some bright flashy instant gratification TV

special push one button and it's over mutual assured destruction
pull out and nuke 'em from orbit sort of thing?

Well, I think we just got tired of bashing the dr00ds, the horse
was not only dead, it had been pulped and spread as fertilizer.
The dr00ds are still out there, but now we mostly just ignore them.

Old habits die hard.
