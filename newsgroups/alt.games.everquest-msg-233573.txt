In this particular example - the necro and his pet are soaking up mana
needed to keep the ranger up and swinging.  The necro can lifetap and feign,
so no excuse for a necro to need heals as far as I'm concerned.  Bonechips
are cheap and plentiful, again, don't bother healing the pet.  Keep the
ranger and yourself propped up.

Verthandi,
28th Necro
