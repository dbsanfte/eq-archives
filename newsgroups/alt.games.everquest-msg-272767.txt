An argument that assumes the burden of early disclosure falls on
the vendor, not the vendors customers, and that there is sufficient
choice in the marketplace for the customers to obtain an alternative
vendor with better security practices while still providing the
required functionality at a competitive price point.

I've not yet seen that market ;) Report the bug to Sony, if nothing
happens in a week or two then email the bug to their head of CSR
outlining the possible consequences. If nothing happens then post
it on their forumns ;)
