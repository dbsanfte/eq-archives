Instructions large races can't follow:

"Get the !@#$#!@ out of the doorway/hallway/only escape route!"

Instructions tanks can't follow:

"Get that !#$!#@$ mob away from the wall!"

Instructions casters can't follow:

"Please stop wandering off to kill other stuff/reading a book/watching 
tv/cooking dinner while we're in the middle of a fight and you're 
supposed to be healing us/slowing the mobs/controlling your pet, who 
just dragged 30 more mobs onto us."

Instructions beggars can't follow:

"Shut. UP."

Instructions mobs can't follow:

"Ack!  Stop hitting me!  I'm only the healer, dammit!  You want the 
tank!  He's the one making you hurt!"
