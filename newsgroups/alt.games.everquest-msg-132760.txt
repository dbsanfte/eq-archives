Sometimes the guild has raids that they say are 55+ because "aggro gets out of
control."  Me being 54, and that they were going to CT where mobs are blue to
me, I feel I must find out more about this.  Does being lower level really
cause more aggro when there are 2 groups of mostly high 50's pounding away at a
mob?
