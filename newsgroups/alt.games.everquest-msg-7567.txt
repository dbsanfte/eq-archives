This rant is more for all pay to play games.

I know that these companies need the monthly fee's to keep the servers
running, but whats the point of the huge price for the software?  When EQ
first came out it was almost 60 bucks Canadian.  Since you can't play the
game without paying why not pump out CD's like AOL and just make money from
the monthly charges.  Or sell it at like 10 buck the way it's priced now.
Or have a free download.  If it was free to try I'm 100% sure more people
would get hooked.  When the game first came out, if you bought it and didn't
like it you blow 60 bucks, at least now if you hate it its only 10 bucks
gone.

Like planetside is coming out soon but, I'm not going to pay 60 for a game I
may not even like, and then pay monthly.  I'll just do like I did for EQ,
wait for a year until the game is dirt cheep and then buy it.

Well thats my rant, thanx for your time
