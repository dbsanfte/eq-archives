So what you ACTUALLY meant to complain about is that the components for
Fletching recipes with trivials above 202 only drop on Luclin. However,
those components don't spontaneously destruct when someone brings them
to Norrath, you know(*). Maybe you could interact with one of those mobs
you see running around, the ones that don't always respond to Hails, and
have a slightly different blue color for their names (some of them have
purple names for no good reason). Some of them might offer a quest by
which you could obtain the components you want. Beware though, they
don't always use [ ] around their quest text, or even mention them at
all. Try just expressing what you want in normal language.


(*) anyone else remember some pre-release blurb for SoV that suggested
that some items might not be able to be taken off Velious?
