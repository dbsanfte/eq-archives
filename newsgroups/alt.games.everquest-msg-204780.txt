My pc was freezing up at the login screen, so I just reinstalled all
expansions of EQ.  Now, when I run it, I get a "Connection Error,
contact Sony" blah blah error.  My connection is fine.  I just tested
it, and everything's coming back fine.

What's going on?  

Also, I have LoY on another computer... can I redownload for this one?
 Or do I need to buy it again for this PC?

Thanks for any help you can give...

-J-
