Heh, actually, it was that way in Beta, but they changed it a bit. You
still find a book, but they are somewhat hard to get to in some cases, and
can no longer be bought.

More significantly, though, the reward isn't any attack bonuses or
whatnot, but instead a book and trophy for your house. For example, I have
a halberd from the Gnoll one that hangs on my wall in Qeynos.

The gnoll and orc books are easy to get to.  Higher than this you have to
start going into places like Stormhold, Enchanted Isle, etc etc.
