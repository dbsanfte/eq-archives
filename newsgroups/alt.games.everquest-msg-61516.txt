I'm not powerful enough to kill willowisps on a regular basis yet; I've killed
about three so far, and had to have help with finishing off two of them. Got a
lightstone off one, burned out lightstones off the others.

I also got killed by one once; I was sitting back letting my pet fight it after
I hit it with  a Poison Bolt, just meditating and casting Mend Bones whenever
my pet ended up with less than half its normal health; to make a long story
short, I ran out of mana, my pet was killed, and I couldn't zone fast enough to
get away; the wisp had a little over 1/4 of its health left.
