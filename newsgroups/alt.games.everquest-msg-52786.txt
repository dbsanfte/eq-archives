Well, lets assume for the sake of arguement that offense and defense
have the same chance of going up with each check.  Lets further
assume, for no reason at all, that your weapon swings as often
as that of the mob slamming away at you.

Normal characters would then see offense and defense go up
at the same rate.

With a DS on, though, you'd be getting literally twice as many
checks on offense as on defense... one each time -you- swing,
and one each time your -opponent- swings, while your defense
only goes up on your opponent's swings.

Of -course- your offense is going up quicker with the DS on!
