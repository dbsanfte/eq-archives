I think if its 900p to the vendor and you couldn't sell it for 1k... 
then youll just blow it out on the vender.

But if you could sell it for 1k, why would you bother holding out for a 
lousy 100pp over the vender price? I'd still sell it to the vender.

But if there was actually a demand for the item then I'd sell it for at 
2k maybe 3k... on the assumption that if people are going to settle for 
1k they'll just dump it on a vendor and be rid of it. 

I agree 10k is a little high... except that I might also assume that 
other players will be making a lot more pp in this system selling 
*theyre* droppable junk for large amounts of pp. So perhaps 5k or 6k is 
where I'd put the price...
