Ok, first off... no harm, no foul. Don't assume I was upset, just
pointing out that you were making an assertion that I did not agree
with, and which might be ill-aimed at the general populace before you
know them.

Yes you did, and I was saying that you might want to re-evaluate that.
I disagreed with your actuall premise (the context you then re-cited),
and while I'll never say that I know everything about software
engineering, I don't think that's at all the issue here. I've been a
release engineer, software developer, systems admin, toolsmith,
architect and several other software and systems engineering roles,
and don't see anything to suggest that EQ is any more in need of dying
"in a couple years" than Netscape 4 was. True, Netscape needed a lot
of work, but they didn't say, "ok folks, throw away your bookmarks,
delete your configs and don't go to the same Web sites anymore", they
just re-worked the code and released a new (in this case, open source)
version.

All but the open source part could easily be done with EQ, and IMHO,
open sourcing the client would be a smart move as well, since it would
force them to deal with macro and packet-sniffing type problems on the
server-side where that sort of security belongs... but one thing at a
time, we don't expect SOE to wake up and smell the coffee in all areas
at once.

SOE has instead chosen to treat this like a regular video game, where
you might spend a few months on a character, but it's no big deal to
throw it away and start a new one. What's more, they seem to think
that people are playing EQ in large numbers because EQ is a good game.
They're dead wrong. EQ players play EQ because of EQ players, and
unless SOE can solve for that particular riddle in their EQ2 release,
they're hosed, as is the EQ player base :-(

thanks ;-)
