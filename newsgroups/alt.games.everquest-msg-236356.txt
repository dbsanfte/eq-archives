That's not a pointing device issue - that's an EQ 3D engine issue.

Mouse targetting can be very tricky with some mob models (the gnats
in the sewers were giving me fits the other day when I needed to quickly
target an add for slow.  Ended up targetting the potential add before
the pull then assisting the puller - slow the main target, Ctrl+T and
slow the 2nd target.)
