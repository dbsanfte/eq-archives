Thank you for that. I did get a new one on loggin. It did not however solve
the exsisting problem. I'm still crashing to desktop just before the
character select screen.

When I turn everything to the settings I had before the last patch, I get a
msg that I don't have enough memory (256mb) to run eq and it crashes to
desktop. When I turn everything off and low res and as low as anything can
go, I don't get the memory msg, it just goes straight to desktop.

It all worked fine before the patch, so I'm a little reluctant to start
playing around with drivers and such.
Would it help to reinstall dx8.1 and sound and video drivers?
