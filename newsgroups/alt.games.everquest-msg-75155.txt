Hand to hand I wouldn't worry about but, you are going to use 2 handed
slashing as a pally. You can either take my word for it or just check out
other high lvl pallys. Do NOT neglet 2HS. Depending on how lucky you get
with cash flow and drop items 2HS is something that most pallys use. You
will lose the shield very soon in favor of the dmg that a 2hs puts out.
