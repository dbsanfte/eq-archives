I have some basic quuestions,sorry for this,never played
pet classes much.

At which level should I give weapon(s) to the pet?
Should I give 1 or 2 weapons ?
What about damage/delay?
What about other pet gear,is it worth it at low levels?
And how do I find no rent weapons and gear in 
Bazaar search?

My current tactic is to debuff the victim with slow and
suffocoate sphere,maybe 1 or 2 more debuffs depending on 
con of mob,and tank for pet.This works pretty well so
far(enc has only 120 int,but 1200hps unbuffed).
How long can I expect to work with this tactic? -
My goal is to make him 49 for the enchant spells.
