Can I at least rise to the level of peeved?

What's sad is that I invented EQIM.  Well, not
really, but check out this "wish list" post of mine from
9/9/2002:

# >Something just like /w all friends, but *without* loading EQ.  In

#
# Or slightly more ambitious and even more useful, an "out-of-game"
# client that lets you do the full range of /tell, /guild, /who,
# etc.  And preferably in a text-based client that doesn't require
# a game-ready video card (yes, Virginia, people are still often
# confined to computers without 3D graphics cards at times).
#
# Occasionally it would be very handy to pop in for a minute
# or so and see if you can catch so-and-so online to ask a
# question or deliver some info, but you either can't load the
# full game from your current location, or don't want to.

So SOE grants my wish and...  It's too buggy to use.

/sigh
