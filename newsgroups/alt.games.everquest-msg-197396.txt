The thread on what you'd do if you won a big lottery kind of reminds me of
another question my friends and I have speculated on: suppose you could send
a single short message to a past version of yourself, to try to
retroactively change your life?  What would you send, and to when?  Let's
rule out messages like "invest all in Soandso Corporation", since those are
too easy. :-)

One of my friends would send a warning about EQ.  He basically completely
stopped his life for EQ.  I think he only managed to get out because he was
in a top uberguild in the Velious days.  There was enough time between
Velious and SoL that the top guilds finished all the high end content.  If
Sony had been a little faster with SoL, my friend would have been doomed.

My first obvious choice would be a warning about a job interview.  In 1982,
I was a senior at Caltech.  I wasn't really interested in one interview I
went to with a small company that was recruiting on campus, so didn't try
hard, and so didn't get an offer.  I wasn't interested because I had decided
that I was not willing to move away from all my friends and start over in a
state I'd never even visited.  The company?  Microsoft.  Getting a
programming job at Microsoft in 1982 would have been about the equivalent of
winning the lottery...I believe everyone then got lots of stock options, and
Microsoft has done pretty well in the stock market since then. :-)  So,
"work for microsoft!", sent to my 1982 self before that interview, is an
obvious candidate for my message to the past.

However, there's a certain friend of mine that I didn't meet until *after*
1982, and so if I sent that message, and it worked...I'd never have that
friendship.  Possibly become a billionaire who never meets that one friend
vs. a great friendship (but sometimes a very trying friendship...the friend
I'm thinking of is the EQ addict, and that has led to some hard times
between him and his friends)...not an easy choice.  I think I'd go with
keeping the friend, and send something to help myself deal with the trying
times...maybe "Soandso is worth it, barely", and trust my younger self to
correctly interpret that "barely" part. :-)
