No offense taken.  If someone has a rational reason why my class is
busted, I'd prefer to understand it before the nerf bat strikes. :)

You're close, the high end slows are 75% (shaman), 70% and 65%
(beastlord).  Look at it from the other angle though.  After the slow
has landed, the mob is attacking at 25%, 30% or 35% of its base rate.
A beastlord slowed mob is delivering 40% more damage than if it had
been slowed by a shaman (35/25=1.4).  I won't try to engage in the
debate about how/whether Slow has wrecked EQ, but I understand that a
better slower is noticeable.  I'll agree that beastlord slows beat the
heck out of an unslowed mob, though.

At lower levels, the effect is less dramatic.  At 20, we get a 15-22%
slow (depending on caster level) - nice, but not drastic.  Segue to a
long stretch until 50, when we get a 35% slow - a third less damage is
definitely significant, but not by itself overpowering.  At 60, I just
got a 50% slow.  Half off all melee damage is a lot, I'll admit.  Now
we're entering the realm where one could argue that the existence of
slow itself is breaking EQ. :)  If I 50% slow two mobs, I may as well
have mezzed one instead.

To which, I say, thank goodness.  We only pass out a few, but it's nice
to have *something* unique that isn't superceded by someone else.
Rangers and Paladins have HP/ATK buffs that compete favorably with
ours, and Rangers have a DS that stacks with others, I think.  Every
class should have something unique to offer, I feel.

Beastlord healing is on par with Ranger healing.  Paladins are somewhat
better at it.  A recent patch message (a few months ago) re-affirmed
the developers' intentions to keep ranger and beastlord healing at the
same level.

I have heard that LDON was the best thing that ever happened to the
group desirability of beastlords, rangers, druids and shaman.  The
versatility of a hybrid is a good thing, but comes with a tradeoff.  A
druid can't beat cleric healing, but they bring other things to the
table.  In an ideal world, the specialists should bring enough to the
table to be competitive with the hybrids.  I can slow almost as well as
an enchanter, but my crowd control (off-tanking, basically) isn't
nearly as good, and my mana regen and haste buffs are inferior, to say
nothing of lacking Lull or Charm.  Where a beastlord shines is that we
can substitute for a number of classes in a group.  If we have a shaman
or enchanter, I can stop duplicating their talents and concentrate
instead on dealing more damage (e.g. swap out my buff or slow spellgem
for another nuke).  If I'm the main slower and buffer, that's takes
away time and mana from killing things quicker.

I have heard the same thing about us supplanting others, which is why I
mentioned my limited experiences.  Perhaps yours are different.  As a
beastlord, my perspective is skewed - I can only observe whether I am
invited to groups with specialists who supercede me.  Have you ever
been part of forming a group in which someone said, "let's take the
beastlord instead of the shaman", for no other reason than that?  In a
group with a ranger, I'd rather invite the shaman, but starting with a
druid, I'd rather take the beastlord - it becomes situational.  Or, I'd
rather invite a friend than a stranger.  Sometimes, I'll take whomever
I can actually find, but that's another story. :)

Oh, I'm not complaining.  At least at 60, I don't feel left behind on
the power curve, all things considered.  As to haste,
rangers/tanks/rogues/monks all get double attack.  Beastlords do not,
although we can get up to 15% double attack with AA abilities.  That
alone makes haste less effective for us, although one might argue that
we're on par with knights, who do not get dual wield.  In fact, one of
the more viable strategies for improving beastlord (and bard) melee
damage is to go for weapons with big procs (e.g. Delightful Orb,
Dedgerex's Cudgel, Ethereal Destroyer, etc.) instead of more favorable
damage/delay ratios, especially since we can self-buff our dexterity to
help the procs fire more often and get AA's to boost proc spell
effects.  Anyway, no one is seriously arguing that beastlords need
double attack, since we already deal substantial damage with our pets,
which, say, rangers don't have.  I haven't done any parses, but my
informal experience suggests that my pet outdamages me.  If my pet and
I are each fighting a different mob, he usually kills his before I kill
mine.  At the very high end, some beastlords have complained that this
is no longer true (this is part of an argument for more/better pet
foci).  At the end of the day, when I upgraded from a 22% to 31% haste
item, my total DPS did not go up by a factor of (1.31/1.22), but only a
part of that - since I failed to likewise upgrade my damage from pet,
nukes, etc., which are substantial fractions of the total.  Making
beastlords scale correctly is a difficult challenge, regardless of
whether you think we're underpowered at the high end or overpowered at
the low end.

So, while beastlords are only second best, they are a lot closer to
first place than to not having the functionality at all?  I can
understand what you're trying to say.

Where I continue to disagree is your assertion that beastlords are
something "wrong with EQ".  Beastlords are not sufficiently overpowered
that everyone is dumping their main for a beastlord.  I understand that
necros still put everyone else to shame for soloing prowess, and there
are plenty of druids and such around too.  Beastlords are not perceived
as a "make-or-break" class, like cleric healing or warrior tanking or
KEI/Focus/Virtue buffing might be.  Beastlords do not have a monopoly
on any abilities that "break" the game.  I am inclined to agree that EQ
would be a better game if Complete Heal disappeared and high-end Slow
were toned down to saner levels (with the attendant required
rebalancing) - lack of either of these abilities can change whole
encounters from go to no-go.  However, I don't see the beastlord class
as having, in and of itself, a deterimental effect on the game.  If
beastlords are overpowered, it is not by enough to tip the game as a
whole.  In other words, I disagree with you about the scale of the
problem, because I don't see the evidence for it being that large.
