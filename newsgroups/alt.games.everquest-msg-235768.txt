Your specific example suggested that the earth was not created 4000
years ago. I can't prove that. Nobody can. All the evidence in the
world doesn't help... the evidence could have been created 4000 years
ago too.

Quite probably, and I won't disagree. But we don't have any reason to
beleive there is a religious agenda in this case.

Contrasted with some of the bullying I've seen allowed by, and even
perpetrated by teachers the 'child abuse' of misinformation may be
preferable. Then again... there is systematic misinformation being
spoon fed in schools to... conforming to whatever the PC outlook du
jour is.  Not to mention that fairly well adjusted kids are inducted
into hate groups (like white supremists schoolyard peers)

Finally the people I've encountered who were homeschooled excel in
life, and tended to be better for their experience...even the
religiously raised ones.  I've had the fortune of not expeiencing some
cult-homeschool for white supremists though.
