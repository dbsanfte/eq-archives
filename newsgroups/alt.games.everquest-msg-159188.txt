With the Bazaar almost all transactions are done with the seller being
AFK. Makes it impossible to trade. On my old server (Innoruuk) there
is still an active trade/auction channel going in the Bazaar, but I
have no idea how well it works. When I want to buy something I search
the bazaar vendors (who are mostly AFK), and if I don't find what I
want, at the price I want, I leave.
