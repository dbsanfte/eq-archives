Incidentally, my reason for choosing one of ther other has nothing to do
with these wonderfully logical explanations.  It has to do
with....tada...you guessed it...parses. :P  The resident AA Guru of the
Rangers Glade put together enough evidence between himself and his friends
that for Rangers, combat agility was a big help, whereas combat stability
was not.  

I cannot speak for other classes, of course.  With the DS's I am capable
of, it would be rather nice to have mitigation instead of avoidance, as I
could pincushion a mob...but them's the breaks.
