I'm probably giving up one of my secret spots, but:

Cazic Thule Sewers:

The mobs near the Swirling Red Mass spawn drop the rare spell components
for Remove Greater Curse and Divine Intervention, each of which sells
quickly for about 50k on my server).  All mobs are in the low to mid 50s
and none hit for more than 300 (most around 200).  As a cleric soloing
here I see about one rare spell component drop per 4 hours, and get
about 1aa per 90 minutes (or box a 50-something alt and level them at
the same time).  You can add to this the rare occurrance of a Boots of
Flowing Slime drop, plus random tributable drops from other named.
Classes more suitable to farming would probably do better than myself -
can only keep the first 5 rooms clear before repops.
