Well, as I've said elsewhere, a game that starts you out on a beach 
collecting seashells pretty much tells you everything you need to know about 
the game's "vision", all in about the first minute or two you see it, if you 
just take the time to realize it, and I guess I was a bit of a dunce for not 
realizing it the first time.

At least this go-round I was smart enough to finally realize it before 
actually paying anything for the privilege.  :-)
