Kael armor has the highest AC, though it's not that much higher than
SS armor.  For tanks though, and even non-tank plate wearers like
bards and clerics, it's the best armor.  The finger-wigglers would
probably prefer to get SS gear, but it's so close that I've never
heard a caster in our guild complain.
Of course the real reason to be allied with giants is to kill dragons.
I may be strange, but to me the end game is killing dragons.  Killing
dragons is what I really look forward to doing, even easy dragons.  I
did kill a ton of GD giants when I was in my 40s, but only because
they were easy to solo.  After getting to know both the giants and the
dorfs, I've come to the realization that the dorfs are evil, creepy
little freaks, while the giants are stoic and honorable.

plus dorfs squeal when you bash 'em
