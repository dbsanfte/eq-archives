Add WC to the BEEPED up tracking zones. Half the time you CAN track a person,
it have 3-4 spots in zone that the tracking will lead you to, unless you are
already close enough to the person.
So standing at Orc 1 tracking a person at Orc2 will report him as being in the
middle of the damn forest, around in middle of zone. If you pass close enough
by him on the way to where you THINK he is, the tracking find the right
target, and you can find him.
