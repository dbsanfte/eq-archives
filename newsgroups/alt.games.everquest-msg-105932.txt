NO. I am trying to point this out to you. *In the context of what he
is talking about*, which is what the PERCENTAGE haste measures, delay
decrease IS NOT THE SAME as speed increase.

Though he calls it damage increase, his own examples show he was
clearly referring to it as such to differentiate it from delay
decrease.

Damage IS increased over a set period of time by haste. But it comes
from attacking more often, which would have been a better way to put
it.

I'll put it another way - in the context of his argument, HE IS RIGHT.
Haste is measured by the increase in attacks (which has the REAL
by-product of increase in damage), not by the reduction in delay.

He definately could have phrased it better but there's no reason to
believe he ever thought haste was actually increasing damage PER HIT,
as you seem to be implying.
