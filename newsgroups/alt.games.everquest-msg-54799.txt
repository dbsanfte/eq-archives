The rathe one is broke though, the maddening priests don't have the
drop so its nothing to do with you reminding people

See above ;) People were doing that quest basically within the first
hour, the last part just does not exist. This event will go on and on
there until they turn it off totally.

Yeah there is such a volume of lore stuff which is specific to only a
few classes that tons of it is rotting even though people call out
locs. They were green and xp or blue to my dark elf 37 and all green
and no xp to my 55 druid except that big blue drake thing with the
dragon roar (ouch)

My 55 druid with some tov armor and such got a couple things I can
actually use, the 1 ac 4 wis, 20 mana and 20 hp earring ( I usually
just wear bd earrings around since I became a res nut but I figure I
can store one until specifially needing reses) and even better the 3
wis 10 MR 10 FR and 10 CR shawl, which is really a good improvement
over the 4th or whatever shawl quest with its 4 cr (I kinda have given
up on the other ones since I've been not bored enough to want to
collect 75 spider silks in velks). Both are Clr Dru Shm. We got a TON
of the earrings off the wretched mares and they are lore so we were
calling out locs a lot.. finally one mare dropped 2 shawls which we
got then the next one dropped one too! So we called out the next
making someone quite happy. So I really like the event a lot since it
got me to like 206 base wis with 93 base Mr, 90 bas Fr, and 99 base CR
all the time.

Archon is always there as a primordial malice trainer (cleric, my dark
elf can train with him now after killing dorn and gix quite a few
times (only brought them to indiff.. ahahah! I am so naughty...) )
But this archon is indiff to my wood elf instead of scowl, says
something different and is not a trainer. Since that quest is broke we
though perhaps he was what you are supposed to kill but no such luck
although it was fun because it took like an hour (he has a freaking
huge load of HP) It was very fun to see tons of people from several
"uber" guilds beating on him and actually starting to argue over how
to possibly loot and who started him before he died, it ended up he
dropped nothing anyway and nothing changed. He also respawned before I
was done fully medding up which I thought was pretty funny.

Its almost a good thing that the quest is broke, as you say pretty
much. This is really a boost to people's items and general morale. I
got on my 37 dark elf cleric twink and ran it there to get the earring
(beats a forest loop, good combo with her ivandyrs hoop ;) ) and it
took her like 4 seconds after zoning to get one because, just as I
hoped, someone had killed one just inside from feeroot to the left
where they were spawning by an undead spire. She saw the corpse and
asked if there was a spare earring on it? and they said yes loot it ;)

I also saw a friend get an okay 10 on some resses warrior neck thing,
saw some okay unique sk bracers and various other things. These npc
events were about the best I've seen verant do them ever, much better
than dumping dark elves too high for the people in the zone into east
commons or dumping Fayd in lake of ill omen. Some clerics even set up
a res station by the zone to lake rathe, fun ;)
