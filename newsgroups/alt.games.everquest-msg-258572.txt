Exactly, I'm really looking to be as efficient as possible. Root/DOT
the mob, hit my manastone 7-10 times while rotting it, chloroplast
regen, maybe a spot heal to be safe. Repeat over and over again, have
very little downtime, have fun killing constantly using manastone
to full effect.

Doing it the way Lance suggested doesn't really save me mana or time
at all, I don't think. Kill a mob or two using up all my mana, (saving
300 mana to port out), 30 sec zone loadtime, spam my manastone till
I'm almost dead,  chloroplast and 250 mana to heal up, another 70 mana
to gate back, 30 sec zone loadtime. Come back to find somebody took my
camp spot. I've done the back and forth zone thing, I don't find that
fun at all.


Great thing about manastone is being able to cast it while fighting
and it being instantcast. Works great when you are totally out of
mana, mob starts running from you, click on manastone twice, and snare
that mob. Then click on manastone 4-5 more times so you have enough
mana to cast a direct damage spell to obliterate it (instead of
standing there for the next 5 minutes trying to melee it to death).
