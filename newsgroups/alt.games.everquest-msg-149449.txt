Doh!  Nothing like having it in big letters on the main page...

I was looking all over www.everquestlive.com, figuring that since
the original offer was for existing subscribers, it'd be
on the "live" site (which is for current players) if it was
available at all.  I never thought to look on the front
"marketing" site.

Thanks much.
