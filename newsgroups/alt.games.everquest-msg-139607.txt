Maybe I just misinterpreted your post.  This bit:

Sounded to me like you meant that "the reason behind such things now
[gay pride]" is to force it into the media or the streets.   I was
trying to say that the reason, if any, is unimportant.

I did get that.  I think we just miscommunicated.

On a side note, that drastically changed this year here in Ottawa.
The media covered Pride Week in much the same way as they did the Jazz
Festival and other events.  I don't know if its just the social
change, or the impact of 50,000 participants, but the seemingly
overnight change was startling.

> if one group is afforded a day, then so should all.

We agree there, and I am a proponent that every groups should get off
its butt and celebrate its uniqueness and its part in the diversity of
our soceity.  I go out to the Chineese/Vietnamese new year
celebrations here, to the First Nations Pow-Wow, etc.  I've even
attended some religious events (even if I didn't care for the
religion).   I have the advantage of living in a national capitol with
a high tourist trade, but its fine by me if we have a festival every
week.

I love christmas personally, but our family xmas traditions are based
on things older than Christianity.  I don't personally have a big
problem with Chritsmas in our society*, but it is a good example of a
culturul event and religious holiday which are inescapable to those
who would rather not participate.

(* OK, I take that back, I have a BIG problem with stores selling
their xmas stuff before the Hallowe'en stuff is off the shelves!)
