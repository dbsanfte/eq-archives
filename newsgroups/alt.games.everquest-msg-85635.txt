  Right now, active characters can take anywhere between 5 and 25
minutes to get disconnected.  I've never heard of a 5 minute+
lagspike, and if a character survives 5 minutes linkdead, it's
safe to say they probably weren't intentionally disconnecting
themselves to escape some sort of danger.

  I personally think they ought to go back to the way it was a
year and half or so go, when you could log back in while your
character is linkdead.  Back then, going LD was a minimal
hassle... even with my slow compute, I'd be back in the game and
playing within 2 minutes of going LD most of the time, and when I
got back in, I still had my pet and all my NO RENT items.  Now
it's just a huge pain.
