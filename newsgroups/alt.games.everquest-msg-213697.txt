Easy enough to find this in PoK.

And this.

Considering you're basically looking at being a solo XP machine, not
*too* much use for this.

I like Sean's idea of taking Quiescence over this.  Outdamages slowed
PoP tier1 mobs, so you gotta know it's nice :)  Also nice for when the
cleric is having trouble keeping up with CHes in group.

Ensnare = upgrade and lasts like 11 minutes instead of 1.5 :)

I'd go for single target mez over AE.  I forget what the lvl 65 one is
called.

On the right track with pets here, but as I recall the necro pet is a
rogue.  You want something like the bst or mage earth pets, a big beefy
tank :)

I'd go for a succor here.  Not as quick as FD, but more useful for
groups :)

Mine would look a lot like Sean's, but with a snare instead of the magic
nuke (not a lot of stuff that you'd XP on is resistant to both fire and
ice, and more stuff is resistant to magic than those as I recall).  And
maybe a mezz instead of canni4.  I'd be somewhat lom, but like I said
before, KEI is easy enough to find in PoK :)  As for getting out of
sticky situations, throw a q-heal on the pet and pop a thurg gate potion
:)
