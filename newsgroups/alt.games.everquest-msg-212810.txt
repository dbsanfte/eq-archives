First, since you have DSL, make sure you have a DSL filter on EVERY phone in
the house.  If even one phone is without the filter, you will have problems.

Second, visit a tweak site. I suggest http://cable-dsl.home.att.net/. It has
a lot of useful information.

Finally, consider getting an UPS or a line conditioner for your DSL modem. A
small change in voltage could cause your modem to lose connectivity. Less
than a second will cause LD. (This is how we solved our LD problem on a
cable modem.)

Your video card can cause lag, but it won't cause you to go LD.
