So at what age would you protest a kid being tried as an adult?  At what age
would you scream at the TV, "are you NUTS?  I don't care WHAT he did, that's
a KID, for chrissakes!!!?"  Twelve?  Nine?  Five?  Two?

Because I've seen pictures of kids under 10 with a very old look in their
eyes (and quite frankly, no prosecutor is going to try to try a kid as an
adult if they can't get pictures of them looking much older than their
years).  Jazz says, if they have a hardened look about 'em, try 'em as
adults...but he didn't answer my question either. :)
