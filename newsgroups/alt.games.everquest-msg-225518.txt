Aha, looks like a much better explaination for what we saw; he was 
indeed getting resists, and since TW can break early, the resists would 
happen while the mob was in run away mode as often as not, leaving us 
with what looked like a mob that wasn't snared until after it started 
running.

He wasn't dishonest after all, merely incompetant.  Since he also wasn't 
trainable (on other issues, not this one, which we didn't understand 
well enough to try and correct) that still lets him out of the "group 
with this guy again" list, but its much more forgivable.

Splendid
