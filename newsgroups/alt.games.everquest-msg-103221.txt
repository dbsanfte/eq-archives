I really fucked up.

Call it beer muscles. Stupidity. Lack of experience. What have you. I
got the guild wiped out. On a REALLY impressive scale.

I was happily camping the Ogre in the Karanas for some Bat Skull
earrings for my wizzie. (Didn't get them.)  One of our remaining druids
who didn't have the epic part from VSR came in guild chat and said VSR
was up in KC. I checked the /who all GUILD.  I had ten people from my
regular raid force on. Two clerics (including Tiru who isn't even IN the
guild). One chanter. Me and the other MA. (Both 55 tanks.) A few others.

I'd been out at a card party and fairly buzzed. I determined that last
time I'd beaten VSR we only had eleven, and I was *SMARTER* now, so ten
was "just fine". I called the raid. Everyone came. (Hell. I'm the
fucking RAID LEADER. And an ELDER in the guild. Of COURSE they came. All
ten of us.)

I'll spare you the details of the bloodbath. We killed VSR and two of
our druids got thier epic rocks. ON THE THIRD TRY. I died four times, as
did Tiru. The second cleric died three, as did the SA. The ONE chanter I
had... I don't know. She died about.... oh.... six hundred times. If she
doesn't quit the guild tomorrow I'll be shocked. Frankly, I still don't
know how we even killed him on the last shot. There were only four left
alive when VS went down.

We won. But what a fucking cost. I serously fucked this one up. I let
pride and anger get the best of me and threw an undergunned force at a
mob we barely had a chance at... over, and over, and over again. If I
try to add up all the hours of XP grinding that was lost in the deaths
taken from my raid force tonight, I'll cry.

Man. I seriously suck.

I was going to say somthing profound. But I think I'll go to bed.
