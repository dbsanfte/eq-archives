Earring of the Solstice quest is worth doing, since all parts are
buyable. I also like Lizardbone and Iron Scream earrings.

Get a Valorium Ring of Gallanty or two if you can. Also, many servers
have routinely sold 8th Coldain rings.

I like my Imbued Granite Spaulders for the saves. Also, there are some
decent rogue shoulders that are a random drop off of PoS giants.

If you've REALLY got plat to burn, go for Stanos' Wicked Breastplate.
Otherwise, I'd shoot for the Acid-Etched Chain Tunic.

RBG, for the stats.

Don't buy anything else for your weapon slots. We're one of the few
classes thats epic stays useful for a *long* time.

Once you get the epic, check out Cloak of the Maelstrom, Lodizal
Shield, or Hierophant's Cloak.

I used Idol of the Thorned in that slot forever.

Precedent. They used to be 50k. People don't want to admit that
they're ancient now.

LSoEE stops being particularly useful as you get into the 55+ game.
That's when I sold mine, as the conditional damage became more
conditional.

Doing the epic in a day means picking a day when the translator MOb in
Rathe is up, Phinny is up and willing, and book in Hate is spawned.
I've heard of one rogue on Torv doing this, but it required insanity
and more than a little luck.

Iksar and Vah Shir are useful, providing you're agnostic. Vah Shir is
a real pain to get, though.

Not much. + Lockpick helps in exactly two places once you're at 200,
IME.
