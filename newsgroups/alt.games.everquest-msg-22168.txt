You can't really split hairs too much when selling things. If you done that
you would likely never make much plat. Some things you just can't really
role play while playing the game effectively.

You should go check out Sullon Zek, or maybe even one of the PvP Teams
servers. This sort of behavior is pretty much expected there, and you can
freely attack members of the races you're against.
