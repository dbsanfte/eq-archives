The way it works now is part of what makes the game interesting.  There 
are several problems with coming up with your "accurate" conning system.  
The skill level of a player, as well as his class, equipment, spells he 
has, and the exact makeup of the mob he is attacking can be huge factors 
in whether or not the person can take on the mob solo.  Attempting to 
build all of that into the conning system would be difficult at best.  
So, instead, they give you a system that tells you the relative level of 
the mob, and then lets you learn from trying whether or not you have a 
real chance at taking down the mob.  Even with blue cons, if you read the 
message, it does not say that you have any guarantee of being able to 
kill the mob.
