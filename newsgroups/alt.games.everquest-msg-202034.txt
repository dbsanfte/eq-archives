New Inny is a mini-ring event.  Once you kill old Inny he poofs (no
corpse) and another NPC spawns who walks a little bit away, summons
any surrounding mobs (dark blue to 65 - Tier 1 yard trash level prety
much) and spawns new Inny as the same time.

Unfortunately when someone dies you get new spawns (Imps) not unlike
the skeleton part of Carprin cycle which tends to get out of hand
quite quickly when people start dying.  Anyway with four groups the
adds beat us up and took our lunch money pretty quickly.
