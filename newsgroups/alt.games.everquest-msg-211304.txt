Well I did check the druid ring vendor a few times with no luck, the only
place I've seen them on vendors was in High Keep.  Bought a few off bazaar
mules (under 2pp only, no gougers encouraged) and have subsequently seen
one drop off An Alligator in Feerrot.  Sol A looks like a potential
camping spot, my list shows it with a 55% exp bonus, hmm, have to look
into that.

Aye, I maxed out research skills and intend to always do so before risking
research components, the darn things are too hard to come by (and in the
case of the spell scrolls, too expensive) to risk doing anything else.  12
to 16 to 20 to 24... well that sounds like a -lot- of words risked, or
heck, even just used, the savings would have to be pretty good to make up
for losses.

Aye I concentrated on getting the water pet because thats the focus I had,
although I ended up making a Fire pet first because I ran out of parts for
Water and had the shard and scroll for fire to try.

The trader bags in the bazaar are 10 slot giant size containers that make
great bank bags for just over a plat.  The bag and box you suggest might
be handy for actually collecting the darn stuff though, as the trader bags
weigh in at 25 stone apiece...
