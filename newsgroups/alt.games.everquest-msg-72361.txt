1) So, for those of you who have played the beastmaster, what's the verdict
on the class?  How about it's solo-ability?  And I really don't mean whether
it's solo-able as a twink with two lammies and a fungi.  Is it a fun class
to play?


2) What's the best place to hunt on Luclin for a 20 lvl druid in terms of
good loot as well as xp?  And what's the most popular place for 30+ if I
want to find a group for my ranger?

Thank you all.
