Koadics Endless Intellect and Clarity 3 are one in the same. If you
are a class that uses mana, you benefit from C3. It increases your
WIS, INT, and regen rate for mana.  This does not mean you can
suddenly run out and kill any mob of your choice. It does mean that
you will spend much less time sitting in meditation to regen mana.  A
donation is exactly what it says, a donation. If you are unsure about
what is acceptable to the Enchanter casting the spell, ask if a
specific amount is OK.......'Hello so-and-so, will you cast C3 for xx
plat ? '      Unlike SOW, KEI is a group spell, so watch for the
Enchanter to invite you into a group, then click follow.   After he
cast the spell on you, click disband.   IMO, if you are a caster, I
suggest you play without KEI for a bit until you learn your
limitations, recovery rate, how to pace yourself, etc., then when you
are fighting in a group, and  KEI runs out, you dont panic or feel
like you suddenly have to abandon your group to go find another 'fix'.
