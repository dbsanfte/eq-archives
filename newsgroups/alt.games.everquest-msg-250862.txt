Having done this lots, I can assure you it works.

Before they changed how reclaim worked I actually gained
mana during the process - now it's a low mana drain.

1.  Summon SoM (highest DPS pet available)
    400 mana base, 360 with Spec Conj, 320 with SCM3.
2.  Pull with Burst of Flame (5 dam)
3.  Wait for the mob to get very low HP (don't wait
    for 1% - you'll lose more xp that way, SoM will
    take level 30-35 mobs from 10% to zero in a combat
    round.  If that happens too much, switch to 
    49 fire)
4.  Reclaim - get from 300 to 240 mana back (depending
    on how much you spent.)
5.  Have PL'ee finish mob (helpful if the PL'ee has
    nukes or a pet)
