That's too bad.  It would be very interesting to see 6 Warriors group.

That's not as absurd as it sounds.  Consider the case of 6 Warriors fighting
a melee mob.  The Warriors are doing 6 times the damage of a solo Warrior,
so the mob goes down in 1/6th the time.  This means the mob generates 1/6th
the damage it would against a solo Warrior.

If the 6 are taunting, so that the mob is spreading the damage equally among
the 6, each Warrior takes just 1/36th the damage they would have taken
soloing that mob.

So, starting from all Warriors full health, if they can find a mob that a
solo Warrior could get down to 97% before dying, the group of 6 could take
that mob.

If they limit themselves to mobs that a solo Warrior could get down to 94%,
the group of 6 could take those mobs on 1/2 health, and so with bandaging,
chain them with low downtime.

A 6 Warrior group in an area where most of the fights are against melee mobs
could actually be very effective.
