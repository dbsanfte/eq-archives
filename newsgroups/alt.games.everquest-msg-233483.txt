Hi all

Who gets what?
Played in a group all low level (10-11) Ranger, Necro and me - buffed
the ranger with centre and holy armour then went in ranger as tank but
soon necro picks up adds (too many in fact) so I have two guys and one
pet getting hurt - so I heal ranger as much possible then healed necro
and pet his adds are a pain because he brings them too close so when I
root there on top of us, anyway mana is at zero now so have to melee
to kill mobs.

So should I bother with the necro and pet and stick to ranger (tank)
or is there an order clerics should stick to...I have read ealier that
the tank is my main focus?
