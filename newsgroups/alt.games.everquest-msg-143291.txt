What motherboard are you using?  You mentioned the ASUS site, so I'll have
to guess that you're using an ASUS board.  I know when we were evaluating
workstations, the ASUS Socket-A mobos didn't fare well with Crucial memory,
nor with any memory manufacturer that used the same chips (Micron, I think,
but I can't remember offhand.).  The machine wouldn't even boot with a
Netgear NIC installed.  The memory-compatibility caused huge stability
issues, even with the 4-in-1 drivers installed.

We called ASUS tech support about the problem, and they don't test their
motherboards whith that memory, nor do they support anyone who uses that
memory in the motherboard.   That kind of lapse in testing (Micron supplies
a huge number of resellers in the US) makes me think twice about ever buying
anything from ASUS again.

And yes, the 4-in-1 drivers make a huge difference in the stability of your
system.  The standard Windows drivers just don't cut it.

BIOS updates are also super-important, as I've seen them increase the
stability of the ASUS Socket-370 boards we used to use.

I run an EPoX 8KHA+ (VIA KT266A chipset) with an AthlonXP 1800+, 512 MB of
Crucial PC2100 RAM, a SB Live!, a Netgear FA311 NIC, and a GF4-Ti4200 on two
boxes at home (wife's and mine) running WinXP as well as my buddy who has 2
of the same, and neither of us have any issues running EQ.

I'll have to say from my experiences with other mobo manufacturers that ASUS
just screwed the pooch on this one, and it's their implementation of the
chipset that is goofy, not the chipset itself.  At my office, we use 25 of
the EPoX boards in a nearly-identical config (different video cards) for 3D
modeling and game design (including heavy programming), and I haven't had a
single machine crash due to hardware failure.

Just my $.03 (I'm worth more than the next guy *G*)
