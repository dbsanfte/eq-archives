/nod I agree got my druid up to 30th level, definitely without pl etc,
not sure on /played but i would guess it's gonna be between 60 and 70
though.  I never saw the gate collapse til recently, and now I seem to
get it at least once a week of playing.  My baby necro got killed
because my gate collapsed yesterday, which really sucked since i was
bound in EFP and died on the aviak island in OOT, nothing like a 20
minute wait for a boat to do a cr.
