It is nice to hear that you are happy with FV!  I've run into many people
who have the attitude of 'been there, done that, didn't see what is so great
about it'.  For me, I think it would be a lot of fun, however FV went up
after I created Cory and I am having a blast playing her so I'll stick with
her until her Epic...  LOL  That's the plan anyway...

I have been a gamer since the early 1980's...  Perhaps I'm a bit older than
most here...  I started playing on the original Chainmail ruleset and then
moved on to AD&D which I have played for close to 20 years now.  I've also
had a great time with the White Wolf worlds of Vampire and Werewolf.  I
mentioned previously that I used to be a Star Trek Con geek...  What I
neglected to mention is that I'm still a Gen Con geek... hehe

Anyway, I live far away from all of my r/l gamer friends now, so EQ was a
Godsend when my Mate introduced me to it.  He has dabbled in most every
character and class over the course of the last 3 years.  He really seems to
like the Dark Elves.  I couldn't be happier with my half elf Ranger however.
My hunting partner is a Halfling Druid and I've pretty well decided that a
Druid will be my next character.

Of course, now we are in the process of paying off the balance of this
computer, buying the needed tweaks to get it Luclin ready and also buying a
second puter that is already up to Luclin specs.  It will be nice to have
our accounts on two seperate computers for a change...  LOL
