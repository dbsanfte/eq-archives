Correct. And if you're lucky, the two or three walrus types that hang
there are alone and indifferent. However, there's one of those enraged
bultharks or whatever they are called that paths up and down around that
corner. If he's there, he aggros and then all the walrus types aggro as
well. One of our druids died there before she could finish loading and
even try to run to the WW zone during our last DN trip.  That's all I
meant by "new definition of safe".  I might be safe, but then again, it
might be a firefight as soon as you land.
