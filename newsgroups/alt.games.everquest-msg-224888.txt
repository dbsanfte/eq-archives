I always start out on the Shadeweavers side, as that is the lowest level 
area in PC, doable at level 8 if not earlier.  As you level up (rapidly), 
you move in deeper, and mobs get progressively harder until you end up at 
level 24, and have a few mobs that are still dark blue and the bandits 
left as the only options.
