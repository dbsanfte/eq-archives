Does that prove they are neutral?   Almost everybody in EQ has
friends/aquaintances/allies/enemies/rivals/people they dislike.. either
personally, or through their guild.

Thats an EXTRA 3 hours on the next rage pop.. 6 hours on the one after that,
after 4 pops thats a whole half day longer for everybody camping it (and
rising as more are missed).  Its not like Rage pops a lot, and cleric epics
aren't the fastest thing entering EQ.

its one of the worst exp zones I've ever been in :)  And I spent a long ass
time there

My guild raids most days... it's hard to plan raids because of the random
spawn timers etc.. and if you delay, or wait till raid day.. chances are the
mobs going to be dead.

Are you suggesting every guild has to put a halt on their raids for half a
week, while one of them camps a cleric?

The first SF rage we killed, the cleric said /guild RAGE UP!! at the very
moment we charged Zlandicars lair (really awesome timing....)  2 guilds were
forming for it, but luckily Zland dropped in <1minute, with hardly any
deaths, we rezzed/looted/ported to SF, and won the race.   That was fun :)

Aye, I was refering to James' servers 'rotation' idea

to me thats bs.. if I get stuck behind a lazy ass and he can't be bothered
to kill Rage, then hes resctricting me and every other cleric on that list.

Thats the norm on Prexus :)

Send it where?  Does it get posted on the web?  How do you know the SS
wasn't altered by the list admin, to try and help/pressured into helping a
friend?

e.g.. when Prexus biggest guild first killed Dain, they got as many chances
as they liked to learn the start.  They got to practise on a (easier 350
dain).  they were also able to use whoever and as many fieends as they
wanted...  but, when they put the Dain rotation together, they got to set
whichever rules they wanted...

Namely you got once chance, it had to be a 425 Dain, you had 12 hours to
kill it, it had to be %80 of your guild in attendance

Well to be honest it only takes 1 or 2 people to check most targets... (I
suppose PoF and PoH would be the exception to this)

Maybe i see it a bit differently, because were doing higher end stuff than
PoF and PoH (except maybe Cazic occasionaly).. but at the higher end, there
are less guilds (albeit each one a lot bigger).. so keeping tabs of guilds,
to make sure raids don't conflict isn't that difficult.

Yep, if your a casual player, or like that type of raid.   Theres also a lot
of players who like spontaneous raids, players who enjoy the rush of a race
to get the first killable force etc.

If that voice is big enough, why should it be ignored?

> but living on a server where rotations and calenders are respected
is -much- less hassle

I've lived on a server that had calendars/rotations, which later transfered
into an FCFS server, so I've seen both sides of it.

I remember when people from other servers would taunt us on our boards,
about our 'handbag' approach to mobs (still using a rotation etc)

Arguments occured then.. arguments occure now, thats just part of EQ..
thatsjust part of any community really.

At first I was sceptical to FCFS, but now Im very much all for it.
Myth 1: Theres no honour between guilds in an FCFS environment

Not true... I see day in day out examples of honour, good will and nice
guestures from guilds racing each other.  Yes theres assholes, guilds who
jack your mobs and train you.. but these people existed a year ago in a
rotation environment, and did the exact same thing.

Yes theres nice clerics... theres nice monks.. nice druids.. nice warriors..
theres also loot whore evil bastard clerics, monks, druids, warriors etc
etc.

Clerics who pocket 5k in gems, after spending ~70pp on dots
Clerics who gate/log before doing an auto split/loot randoming..  the 60
cleric who ninjad our guildies AoN and Lodi shield.

The clerics who only made the class, because the thought of phat masterloot
coinage, and rez donations tempted them

So sorry, but I really have to disagree with that last part of your post.
