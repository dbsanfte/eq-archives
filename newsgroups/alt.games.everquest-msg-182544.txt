I had fun playing a Bard to level 20.    You get your "Sow" song, locate
corpse, and regeneration early.  All these help to drastically reduce down
time.  I played my bard almost straight to 20, then haven't touched him
since.    Iksar SK was also fun.  I didn't think my druid was fun until
after 19 when he got self ports.    If you don't mind down time for medding
a Mage can be fun to 20, in your teens you can solo any yellow, but that
takes a full bar of mana and then takes a while to med back up.  I played
all of these without any twinking.
