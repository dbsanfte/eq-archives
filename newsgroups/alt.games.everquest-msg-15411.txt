LOL- KB Catnip - hehe. One year for Christmas I had received as a stocking
stuffer from my mother a CD for my cats - entitled "Classical Cats".
Contained within the CD jewel case was a small bag of Cosmic Catnip.
Needless to say I thought little of the catnip until I came home one night
from work to find the 300 CD Rack in my office on its side and CD's
everywhere. Naturally it was puzzling, as my two cats are usually quite well
behaved - then I noticed the C. Cats CD was open and I saw the small shreds
of plastic left over from the small baggie of catnip in the CD. Some animals
will do anything for a buzz - lol. My other cat had the infallible ability
to bring up my quicken program almost every time she tried to sleep on the
keyboard. Note that it was a female cat nosing about in my money - makes
sense to me.
