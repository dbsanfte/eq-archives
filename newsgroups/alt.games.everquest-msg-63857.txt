Oh, can I play too?

I've met George Takei and Walter Koenig.

One of the dentists my wife has been to was George Takei's niece
(or maybe cousin, I don't remember).

Scotty, err I mean James Doohan is supposed to live somewhere
around here, but I've never seen him.

Once, in the '80s I was passed on I-5 by a black Jag.  The Jag had a
very small 'Saint' symbol on the back. (some of you may know
what I'm talking about). I wasn't able to catch up to see if Roger Moore
really was driving.

One of my brothers went to school and played football with Danny Bunz.
Now he runs a bar and grill in Roseville, CA called Bunz and Company.

I used to roleplay with Ilan Mitchell-Smith.  I liked him.  Nice guy.
Kinda quite. Of course he had to endure the first hour with the rest of us going,
"Dude!  You got to shower with Kelly LeBrock!"
--"No big.  We had cloth on."
"Dude!  It was Kelly LeBrock!"
--"No big deal, really."
"Dude!"
--*sigh*

Oh, and I used to be a Pyro in California.  No I didn't set things on fire.
(Fire! Fire! Fires cool!)  I used to launch the big fireworks.  Nothing over
8" though.  That requires an electronic shoot.  Much more fun launching the
 rounds with a road flare and 4' of quick match. *evil grin*

Okay, so it may not be as good as yours, Lokari, but it's still cool for me.
Can I join the I r0xx0r club too?
