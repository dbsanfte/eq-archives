I thought that line was from the EQ manual that came with the game.  I
recall reading that line when figuring out what race to play, and I have
never had the Prima guide.

Speaking of Prima...I wonder why their EQ guides suck so bad?  I've got
their DAoC Atlas, and that thing is very good, so sucking is not something
Prima inherently has to do.
