Ok, I guess we have to agree to disagree on this point.  I maintain that it
is accepted 'standard practice' (from what I have seen) to pay for ports in
advance, and you apparently have had the opposite experience <boggle>.  I
wouldnt hold it against anyone that chooses to go elsewhere but if they
whine about it they go on my ignore list.

As has been said before in this thread, the risk of a porter screwing the
customer is way smaller than the risk of a customer screwing a porter.
Mitigate the larger risk.
