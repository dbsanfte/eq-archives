I think very few Muslim countries would take Afganistan's side in this one.
Iraq (of course), Pakistan, maybe Iran.  OTOH NATO is already declared with
us, and Russia hates Afganistan.  Though they wouldn't help us outright, I
don't think they would oppose us for that reason.  China is a question mark,
but they will probably grumble and then do nothing since Afganis are not
oriental.
