Yeah sony share the love.  Nerf Druid tracking and give Ranger version to
Beastlords.  Then us Dark race types can have tracking.  Not having it and
being in a guild thats requirement is KOS any non dark makes it a little
tough to explain what the Ranger was doing in zone so long when an Officer
shows up to "HELP" you with your wandering around looking for that random
spawn. ( A Dire Wolf Stalker commes to mind).  OR as I have said before give
Darkelfs and or Iksar a version of rangers.
