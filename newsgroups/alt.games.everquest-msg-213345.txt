Does running a higher resolution actually increase your field of
vision?  I know that it gives you more room to place your various
sub-windows, but if I'm standing in a crowd at 800x600 and then I
switch to 1024x768, will I see more of the crowd?  Or will they
just be drawn with more detail?

And the same question about the viewport.  If I have a viewport
that is smaller than the screen, and then I increase it to be as
big as the screen, will I see more people?

I assume the first one is no and the second is yes, but I'm at work
and can't test it out.
