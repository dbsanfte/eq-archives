Bizbee, nice to see that someone actually got my point.  Totally agree with
your statement about them only using part of the genre title   I personally
don't see the recent patch as a nerf to soloing, or even a nerf to "soloing
+ mad xp" but was more just commenting on their attitude implied and
sometimes expressed that everyone should/must group.  I love grouping, when
I get a good group, but recently I've really enjoyed soloing with my
beastlord, to me it helps you really get to know your class with its
strengths and weaknesses.  Though I still try to group every now and then so
that by the time I do need to start grouping for epics and such I'll have a
handle on playing my class in a group.
