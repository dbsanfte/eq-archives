When something's rooted, it will fight to the death, no matter what state
it's in .. I've beenr Root/DoT kiting Slate in EC lately, and even when he's
down to nearly zero hp's, he'll still attack me if i get too close .. As
soon as root breaks though, he tries running ;)

So no, Root/Fear doesn't work ..
