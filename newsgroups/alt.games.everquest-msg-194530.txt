Yes, into the brew barrell  put 1 hops, 1 malt, 1 yeast and 1 cask.
Usually all buyable from the one source (http://www.eqtraders.com ->
Trade Supplies)
Then press combine
If successful I get 1 mead and if really really lucky my brewing skills
goes up.

Otherwise I've lacked the skills, but still created something new (weird

Check your recipe and make sure everything is unstacked.

You do know about cntrl+Left click to automatically pick up one of an
item (makes any trade skilling so much easier)
