Actually... I ported a level 37 Elven Enchanter to Antonica last week.

She wanted to "go to antonica" because she had never been there. I assumed
she leveled in Fay until she got high enough to go to Kunark..

I started my first chacter there, so I guess it's why I think everyone's
been there too, lol.
