   Many who play and enjoy EQ benefit from taking a break once in a while. 
I know when I did that in the past, I enjoyed pursuing some other hobby or
interest.  Many in this newsgroup have tried City of Heroes, and many have
found it to not be to their long term liking.  If you want to try to be a
villain instead, but don't want to wait for City of Villains, you might
want to check this site out.

   Just so you all know, I am saving up for the anti-matter anti-earth, so
don't get your hopes up on that one.
