    This doesn't explain behaviour in dead spots, though. I can name one
dead spot where I'm almost within melee range of the mob when it freezes in
place. It isn't moving directly towards me, as you say it should.
Furthermore, this isn't a "dead spot" as much as it is a "dead line", an
entire line where mobs won't attempt to path and freeze when you go there.

    When I petitioned the spot and got a GM to note it, he told me that it
wouldn't likely be fixed because that requires a zone download, but that it
would be watched. This was a GM, not a guide (although not a GM-Admin). All
of this seems to support my interpretation, that even if you're sufficiently
close that mobs will check against pathing to see whether to beeline you or
take some other path.

    James
