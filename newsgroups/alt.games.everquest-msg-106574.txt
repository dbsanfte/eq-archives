    I'm trying to get a feel for how a card that does hidden surface removal
fares in Everquest in some of the choppier spots for me. For instance, like
running through the kitty cat home city, even with a Geforce 2 Ultra, it's
friggin' choppy. It would seem as though a card that doesn't render anything
you can't see, would run EQ pretty well since it seems as though Umbra
doesn't do much of anything other than eat up CPU cycles.
