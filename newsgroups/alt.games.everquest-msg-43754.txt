I've just started playing as a Warrior and like it a lot.The only thing that
I don't like is that when you buy something off a trader you can't tell what
the
stats are for the piece your buying.For example,I want to buy a sword,is
their
any way to find out it's stats before I buy it,like it's hit damage and
stuff.
Also,is their a way to find out what level a player is at when you right
click on them?.

Thanks very much


Paul
