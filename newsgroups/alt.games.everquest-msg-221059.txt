Not sure about currently - but I used Legends over a year ago and tried that
but they did check and send my characters back to servers of origin. They
even got a bit keen and sent my "created on legends characters" to a
different server than I requested as well. It ended up taking over a week to
get sorted out.

I still managed to concentrate all but the "no drop" gear on to one server
though as I used the "created on legends characters" as gear mules. Any
character created on Legends you get to choose where they get transferred to
once your legends subscription expires.

BTW - it was a very nice server to play on.
