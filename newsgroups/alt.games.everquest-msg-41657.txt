Come on DT, you must see through this EverQuestsDaBest by now.

The word troll gets thrown about with such abandon, that it is fast losing
it's original meaning, but I believe this one is the real McCoy. I first
suspected a few posts ago, when he wasn't bothering to follow up any of his
original posts. Then I read the one from the rollercoaster group about
"retards" Even I found that one quite funny.

This post absolutely confirms it. I don't believe he's someone who has
bought an account, I think he has probably played for quite some time and
knows quite well what he is doing in EQ, and this newsgroup. I also think
that he has posted here before, under a different name.

He's quite good at it as well, seems to have got you and bizbee at each
other's throats, by temting bizbee into a tentative agreement with him. And,
whilst attacks on bizbee have some minor entertainment value, I'd rather see
you Americans pulling together at the moment.

My sympathies to anyone who has suffered in this tragedy.
