Similar to Biz, I reformatted my HD last week and had to reinstall EQ. I
did it as mentioned in another post, and it seemed to be working fine.
But our guild was in a non-raid mode and I was pretty much on one
character in about four zones. I saw nothing wrong.

Today I logged in my CR mule rogue in the Hole to go check to see if the
Ratman Guard was up for one of our SK's. The rock golems and ratmen were
all bald naked humans.

I was reminded that the Hole was an "optional zone" not part of the
original Antonica/Kunark package I bought. I had done the thorough file
check when I reinstalled, but on the patch interface I hadn't checked
off optional zones and velious and SoL.  I ran it again today with those
things checked, and got another monster patch download, but when I was
done, all the models were there.

Biz may have already solved this, but in case anyone else is doing
anything similar, remember to check all the boxes besides the language
ones when you run the thorough file check, or you don't get all the
models. 

All fixed now here.
