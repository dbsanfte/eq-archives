Thank you!!!

Finally someone comes up with a source for the argument that Charisma does
not affect faction gain/loss.

Most of what I've seen in this thread up to this point has been mere
contradiction and confident assertions, without any sources or evidence
sited.

Brad's statement is an 'argument from silence' meaning he didn't mention
faction -- which isn't 'absolute proof' that cha doesn't affect faction
gain/loss -- but it's a mighty good indicator that it most likely doesn't.

Thank you again, dstep.  That's a large part of what I've been looking for
in this thread.


P.S.  For 'Absolute Unquestionable Proof' one would probably have to use
ShowEQ...a method I don't recommend due to the potential consequences to
one's account.
