It's not the fools heading for 60 that worry me... I know they're just gonna
EBay the account stripped of gear while they work on the next char. (check
out the sales of nekkid 55+s to see what I mean... they're selling for
around $250-$400 these days... and there's a lot of them about)

It's the ones who are intent on "ubah phat lewtz" and don't care who they
tread on to get it :o(
