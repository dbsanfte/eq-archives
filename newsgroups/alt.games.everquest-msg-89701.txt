Several things:

   1.  Making Ronium, which is a required component
       of each of the Armor of Ro (Paladin quest armor)
       pieces.

   2.  Ronium (and thus Sands of Ro) is also required
       for the Ivy Etched Boots (Ranger) quest.

   3.  Potters can use a Sands of Ro (and other ingredients)
       to make a Small Wisdom Deity (WIS+2, CLR/DRU, Range
       slot item).

   4.  It's one of the necessary ingredients for making
       the "fish food" which triggers the Royal Fish
       to turn into Princess Lenya Thex for the Paladin-only
       Shield of the Silent Watch quest.
