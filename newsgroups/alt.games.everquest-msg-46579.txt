Keeping in mind I'm a newbie, I have to say, my experience seems to
indicate that druids aren't all that great at soloing.

I have a level 15 druid who usually hangs out in West Commons to join
groups at the dervish camp.  But soloing?  Forget it.  My druid doesn't
have a snowball's chance in hell against two dervishes that con blue.
I can handle a single dervish that cons blue.  But that usually leaves
me fairly drained of health and mana.  And requires a lot of luck
because I need lots of room to kite.

On the other hand, my level 10 mage can handle things that con yellow
with ease.  Two blue mobs?  No problem.  Three blue mobs?  I can
probably handle it.  If I get into trouble, I let my pet take the heat
while I make a tactical retreat.

Because I'm so new, I'm probably just playing my druid incorrectly, but
as far as I can tell, I'm using all the correct techniques that have
been suggested to me, and still, my druid is just not effective as a
solo character.  My magician rocks.
