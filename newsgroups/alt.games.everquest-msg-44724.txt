I can only confirm that I have not been having any lag problems on Vazaelle
for the last week. I'm near D.C. on the east coast of the USA. I've been in
Velious, not Kunark. Judging by the .de on the end of your newsreader I'm
guessing you are in Germany (Deucheland (bad spelling I'm sure) and that the
damage to the Verizon (local phone company) building in NYC may be the cause
of your lag. I'm in the internet infrastructure biz and know that many many
circuits were lost and had to be rerouted. Of course I have no way of
knowing the status of the circuit you may be using or it's termination point
to the USA.
