Disagree. I say give them a Pali state and wall them off. Israel can't/won't
due to the need for the labor.

Give them a Pali state and wait, if they go to war with you, wipe them off
the map. But just going in a killing civilians defines Israel as an
oppressor rather than a defender.

Drop the whole Death of Israel thing, it has been dropped from the Pali
charter since 93. It is rolled out and rehashed every time. The only thing
it does now is its utilization as a thinly veiled justification for Israel
to do whatever the hell it wants, without international acceptance.
