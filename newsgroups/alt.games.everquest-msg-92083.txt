Oh, puh-leaze!!!

ALL of the regular servers would be able to benefit from the "Legends"
status if Verant would take their collective heads out of their asses.

Instead of having one server at $40, why not just jack the price of all the
servers up to $15?  This way, they will make more money in the long term
instead of a short burst of cash they'll get until the players realize
they're getting ripped off and either drop EQ altogether, or go back to
regular servers.
