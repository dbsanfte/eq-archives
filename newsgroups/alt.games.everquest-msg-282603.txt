Or maybe it's just me.....

My berserker is now 45 and can deliver serious punishment.  I mean
brutal.  He's a friggin killing machine.  My DPS was more than our
wizards for a single mob, and we both knew we were counting so he was
nuking more than usual.
My point on the above is simply............  RARGH GET SOME!

Now my point for the post; I get bitch slapped silly.  If I draw aggro
I get worked hard and fast.  not like a robe mind you but more like a
monk.

As I understand it a berserker is supposed to be able to serve as an
ST.  Yea right.

At 45, having kept aggro from our warrior for most of 30-40, and
having solo'd for 3 hours one day, my defense is....wait for
it.....here it comes.........80!  Jeezus H Kryst people!

No joke, here's how it went one day.

lvl 38 berserker in Gulf of Gunthak with a cleric partner.  defense is
62 at the start.  I pop Infusion of the Faithful (255 to all stats,
500 to all resists) and go to town.  Non-stop killing and tanking.
Even after IoF wears off we continue down that bloody path for another
2.45 hours.  When the dust settles  my defense went up 3 points, to a
whopping 65.

Now I admit I'm dumb as a bucket of hammers, but even when my int and
wis were at 255 it went up only 2 points.

I'm dyin here.  Am I just the most unlucky Troll Berserker in the
world?  Is there an easier way to get defense up?

Thanks.

~F

PS.  If someone else holds aggro, I will own you!
