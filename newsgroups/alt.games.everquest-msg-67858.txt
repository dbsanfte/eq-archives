I'm running with all options on on the following:

P4 1.9ghz

512M RAM

Geforce 3 TI

SBLive

Everything seems to run fine with everything on (including particles and
such) except for a few zones, where I have to bring the clipping plane in
(Twilight Sea, for example). I don't think you really need more than 512Mb
to fit everything into memory.
