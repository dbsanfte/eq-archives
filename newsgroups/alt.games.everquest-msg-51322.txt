All of this statement except "don't know they exist" relates to my "never
deteriorates idea".  This isn't *my* idea, by the way.  It's a basic
economic theory which applies to real world economics.  Item deterioration
or lack thereof, is the reason for a saturated economy and the fact that
tradeskills are not practiced.  I really find it surprising that anyone
would argue otherwise.

Certainly the companies that design the MMORPGs including VI themselves have
realized this and implemented item deterioration in some form or another in
the new MMORPGs.  This quote is directly from the Star Wars Galaxies FAQ:

"6.04 Will there be item decay?
Yes, to promote a healthy, player driven economy we intend to design Item
Decay (where certain items weaken with time or use)."

Of course not.  That is why trade skill items can not be made for a cheap
price.  Initially they can, of course, but it is *much* more expensive to
learn to make banded armor than it would be to buy it.  They got that part
right.  What they *didn't* get right is that after a server is in existance
beyond a certain point in time, there is no more market for banded armor
because the economy is already saturated with armor that is much better.
The reason it is saturated is because once it comes on to the server it will
never leave of its own accord or through its use.  This *includes* even the
very banded armor the player would have liked to sell.

Can't you see that as the supply increases due to everlasting items, and
demand decreases, also due to everlasting items, that the value of the items
that the poor guy wanted to make and sell with his tradeskills decreases to
nil, and the tradeskill are useless due to these truths?

Okay, you got me there.  It isn't true that they don't have enough money to
get started with tradeskills.  New characters can make patchwork leather and
files and short beer, etc...

If, as their skills increased, they could produce items that were comparable
in quality to things people might find elsewhere *and* things would
degenerate with use over time, then there would be a steady market.  These
two factors would make tradeskills used, and useful, throughout all levels.

No.  The U.S. does not have such a gap.  The U.S. has large lower, middle,
and upper classes and sub-classes of each.  Poor third world countries with
a small artistocracy and a massive peasant class with a miniscule percentage
of the population in between are representative of my example.

Right.  An item that might take a player some 6 hours to acquire can often
be bought for very little cash.  *why* can an item that takes a very very
long time to acquire be sold for a relatively low amount of cash??  The
answer is because both the cash and the item are devalued by a saturated
economy.

Bingo!

The consumables and services are good ways Verant can get money flowing
again.  The twink gear is another shining example of severe economic
problems... the same problems that prevent me from playing a succesful
Blacksmith, if that was what I wanted to play.  I *could* be succesful at
blacksmithing, but I would have to fund my own hobby by fighting monsters.
My blacksmithing trade could not sustain itself, which is representative of
the problem.

Those are some of the problems of a level based game with a curved economy.
The solution it seems is level based equipment.  Level based equipment that
detiorates over time seems to be the route that the newer games are taking.

Right.  Once they have them, then they have them for life.  So on a long
enough time line, everybody who wants the item will have it.  Then, you
could threoretically extend that timeline into eternity and they will never
need it again.  So there will come a point in time that the gems are just
sold back to the vendors because no one will need them, and because the
quest item is no-drop *it* hasn't become a barterable part of the economy
either.  Result?  Saturation and stagnation.  VI has to go *back* to the
drawing board and come up with another item or idea to get the economy
moving yet again, because it doesn't regulate itself.

LOL...  right!  You are arguing my point for me, and I really don't think
you realize it.

It isn't useful.  That's my point!  There are so many of them on the server
already that will never leave, and so many things much better than a widget,
also that will never leave, that the widget, which was at one time useful
when the server was new and the economy hadn't saturated itself with
everlasting items, is no longer useful.

<scratches head> yes.  That is what dictates supply in a self regulating
capitalistic economy.

Items deteriorate in DAoC so players will need to replace their supply, and
price is dictated by merchants who sell similar equipment yet at a lower
quality for a price which is set 33% higher than the cost of the materials.
Trade skill items are better than those found on mobs, with exceptions being
quest items, and both the trade skill items *and* the items from mobs wear
out over time, including the quest items, and need to be replaced, so there
is a steady demand.  To boot, all equipment is level dependant such that
items wear out faster when used by a character of inappropriate level, and
trade skillers need to be of an appropriate level to use an item before they
can make the item, so that economic curve that we discuss elsewhere is
effectively flattened.

Because there is a steady demand and a built in profit margin there is a
steady supply of people who *enjoy* doing trade skills.  All of the
variables... the cost of supplies vs. the regulating retail price at
merchants, the rate of item deterioration, and the success rate at producing
items can all be dynamically adjusted by the designers to tweek the economy
as needed and keep cash flowing.  If Greenspan had such a tool his job would
be gravy.  It's a wonderful economic model for a game.

Given time, the market will become saturated with high end items as well,
and the entire jewelcraft practice will slow down and stop until such time
as VI introduces some new incentive into an economy that can't regulate
itself.

<shrug> so wait a while longer on your server.  As more players reach the
higher levels, and the market becomes more saturated with money and items,
both will be devalued further.  Besides, there will always be some sort of
bartering system, regardless of the inflation level or what is used for
currency.  I never said there wouldn't.  My point is there is no viable
economy that could possibly be based on anything other than fighting
monsters.  It is a saturated economy that can not regulate itself without
constant intervention from the designers.  That is what I'm saying.

<snip pointless debate>

I will simplify my point to this.  EQ is a game about fighting monsters and
getting loot.  You can't feasibly make any money in the game doing anything
else.  This is because of an economy that does not support deterioration of
the items that are introduced into it.  If you want to role play your
character as an entrepreneur and fruitfully parcticipate in some aspect of
an economy, such as tradeskills, that *includes* but is not *based on*
fighting monsters, you'll have to do it in another game.

This is a fact.  If you don't believe it, then we must simply agree to
disagree.

Best Regards
