Leather padding is 1 ruined pelt + 1 silk thread
silk thread is 2 spiderling silks (not stacked)
ruined pelts can also be made by using a skinning knife on "higher" quality pelts. I.E. HQ cat pelt can be made into a MEDQ pelt
then a MEDQ pelt can be made into a LOWQ pelt. LOWQ pelts into ruined pelts.

All of these are made using a tailoring kit or in a loom found in most towns.

www.eqtraders.com is a great site for skill learning and recipes.
