Give it what you like.  I don't troll, in fact.  Any comments made in reply 
to my message are appreciated, and to be fair, some good points have been 
made by some of the people who put some thought into their answers.

Don't be so quick to assume that someone who's wrong is automatically a 
troll.  Sometimes people just get things wrong.
