I've played both extensively. Halflings have handier abilities but i get
flirted with by total strangers as a wood elf. This isn't something i really
enjoy unless i knew the flirter IRL, so it actually could count as a
downside except i spend most of my time as a wolf (and one stage, a tree).
Fortunately trees are rarely sexually harassed. ;-)

Also the wood elf starter city is insane. Now the 'find' command makes it
alright but it used to be  a nightmare. Falling off that place was certain
death, and noone ever thought to include railings. On the other hand,
crushbone is a fantastic starter zone, and sometimes i go there and kill the
zone as revenge for the early years of deaths at the hands of the legos (and
worse) that would train you down... but you can get PL'd there pretty easy
too now since emerald warrior faction is useful for a charm in dulak
apparently. Never got it, alas.

p.s. for cheap thrills, create a halfling rogue and sneak and hide around
the epic mobs in Kithicor. I usually ask them how their day went and give
them a hug, before letting them teleport me back home. Such generous folk.
