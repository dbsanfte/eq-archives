Society's role is to protect people from other people, not from 
themselves. As long as help is available to those who may want to break 
out of an addiction, that's as far as society's involvement should go. 
What you need to get into your head is that, generally, people do drugs 
because they *want* to -- because they enjoy them. Certainly, they can 
be addictive, but that is an assumed risk the users take. If one has to 
be a slave, it's better to be a slave to your own choices than to 
someone else's.

And fortunately, good sense appears to have prevailed in that particular 
issue; not least because nobody yet has come up with a legally workable 
definition of "alcoholic". And, believe me, I've known my fair share of 
them...

/shrug. There are lots of different drugs, and lots of different people. 
Some become wrecks on perfectly legal substances, some remain productive 
and tax-paying while enjoying substances somehow deemed illegitimate. 
The legal status of one substance or another is entirely arbitrary, and 
thus an inevitable source of injustice and abuse.

Being caught with one gram of LSD or five grams of Meths carries a 
Federal mandatory minimum sentence of five years without parole, for 
first-time offenders... Of course, individual states can hand out 
harsher sentences.
