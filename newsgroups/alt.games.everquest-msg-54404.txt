Hmmm, you silly people and your gate hammers.  You're an enchanter,
why can't you bank in FV?  I thought the gate hammer put you in a
place with no aggro mobs.  My guildies with the hammer have never had
a problem hunting KC, but thinking about it they may all be able to
feign.

You might be able to, as long as you don't go much further than UZO or
guard.  I was in Disco today with a 54 enchanter and I had to take
over mezz when things got a bit hairy, she had way too many resists.
Everyone was 54+ and we were pretty much exactly appropriate.  If you
were to bring those three, I would recommend 3 other melee classes
54+, but that's just me.

I wouldn't group with them, and I don't think anyone else would
either.  Druid would be resisted too much, rogue damage table too low,
and both would be aggrod all the time.  If you're looking for a
dungeon I would recommend City of Mist, very nice 45-52.

I have alwasy loved Lower Guk, but I know folks who swear by SolB,
Permafrost is nice if you can take the giants (are they ice or
frost?), but they may still be too tough for you.  The pit there is a
full-on blast, hell the druid can charm stuff there and pretend to be
a pet caster, and the exp is as good as anywhere I've been.

I participated in Test of Tactics tonight, a pick up group because
only two teams were entered, our servers oldest remaining uberguild
and my guild.  I went with my guild and friends 2nd team, we only had
11 of us instead of the 18, and were summarily owned.  The only reason
I mention this is that after the GMs rezzed us, they gave us illusion
gnome.  I got a couple screenshots before the TL'd me to my bind.  I
will never get a mask of the tinkerer (bastards waking the sleeper),
but I've been a gnome!
