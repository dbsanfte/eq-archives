There is no real template.  There are several melee and melee-hybrid 
classes to choose from.  The archetype tank class is Warrior.  So, let's 
assume you start out as a warrior.  The next is race.  The warrior's 
primary stats to worry about (regardless of what Verant might say) are:  
STR (damage), STA (how long can I keep swinging this axe), AGI (improved 
chances of not getting hit), and DEX (how well do the weapons I use work).  
I suggest you go to the following link for more data:

http://eq.castersrealm.com/creationguides/Warrior.asp

Other class types to consider are rogue, shadowknight, paladin, and ranger 
depending on whether your play styles fit these classes.  See the same 
site, http://eq.castersrealm.com/ for more data on these classes.

Be safe and good hunting!
