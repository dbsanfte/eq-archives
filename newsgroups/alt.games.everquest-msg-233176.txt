There is a difference between "Call to Corpse" the AA abiity that allows 
for a reagent free corpse summoning once every 72 minutes, and "Conjure 
Corpse" the 39 necro 51 SK spell that allows a corpse to be summoned at 
the cost of a jade inlaid coffin.

The spell Conjure Corpse is dropped by the Ishiva Mal in Split Paw. The 
AA ability is tougher to obtain.
