Did you need that extra stamina, then?

Nothing readily available, best I can see is the Vah Shir claw earing from
Maidens. AC5 +4sta +6dex, I wouldn't trade my cougar claws in for anything
with less AC, I could well go for these tho.

> jagged bands
Sorry, don't know of any..Fire emerald rings offer strength and dex but no
AC and unless you are a weak race and struggling for str I would not drop
the Jagged Bands for anything other than AC/HP rings.

> straw spun belt
Not much going there, Sarnak Hide Belt AC9 +4str dex and wis, drops in
Charasis (pricey to buy) or Smiters girdle AC10 +3 to all stats (even more
pricey to buy) drops in Scarlet desert. There are others but I'm not going
to suggest taking more than a 2pnt hit on AC for them.

> spider fur collar

Nope, again, I'm looking at 8ac or more and I don't see anything on
allakhazam's that is readily available

I traded AC for the (16) Stamina of crusty legs but I need more AC there so
will be dropping them soon.
As a barbarian who should have some decent physical stats I wouldn't trade
AC for Stamina or Strength especially now you seem ready to compromise yet
more AC on sorting your Dex out.
