That's a horrible idea.  You'd have to create three seperate mules just 
to sell stuff.  Personally I still like the idea of a "no spells no 
pets" zone.  And while we're on the subject, how about "you cannot be 
over this height to enter the zone"?  I'm getting awfully tired of 
getting stuck in a half dozen ogres and barbarians while I'm AFK, or 
when I zone in.  :p  I say, we just admit that halflings are best used 
as mules, and make it a halfling-only zone.
