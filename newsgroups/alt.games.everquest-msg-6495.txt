I played a necro and went to Nejana.  I buffed up my pet and gave him
two fine steel daggers. 

This was the time you could give your pet a fast weapon and it would
use the speed of the weapon.  Well my pet got charmed by the enchanter
and preceded to whoop my ass.  I could not cast one spell because I
kept getting interrupted.  The pet was hitting me for 29+hp.  Yes the
pet conned blue to me.

 When I came back for my body there my pet was with the two daggers
still in his hands and two bodies lying next to him.
