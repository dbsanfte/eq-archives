When a person invests their time, money and mental power on the
painting of the cistine chapel they wouldn't have agreed to do it for
no benefit to themselves every time they turned up for work.  On the
other hand when they put their time, money and mental power into
leveling a character in EQ they gave their word that they would not
sell their character to anyone.  By selling their character they broke
their word.  This would imply that their word cannot be trusted.  We
(and anyone buying the character) do not know the seller and the only
information that we have is that they cannot be trusted to keep their
word.  To buy a character requires some trust that the seller will not
take it back and the only guarantee that we have is the seller's word
that they will not rip us off.  People were pointing this out to any
person that may wish to buy the account.
