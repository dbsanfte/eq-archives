Well, 3 named mobs (MotG, Proggy, FA) can drop a few each (before they would
sometimes drop 1.. now its a few every kill
Then the 4 warders (dragons) drop 4-5 loots each, prismatic+random loots

Well you need the right sort to drop...   1hbs, pokers, 1hs, bows.. and in
the time to get these needed ones, you may get excess 2hb's

Their ratio is 13/20 (15/20 for monks/bst) and thats not bad.  They have a
ton of stats (like 5 to every stat and resist and 50hp/mana) which makes it
a pretty nice weapon anyway.. I still use primal fistwrap in my offhand
(since revamp the weapons are called prismatic xxxx, but its the same thing)

It stacks with shaman buffs.  And no, its very unlikely you do have better
weapons already.

Theres been extensive parsing over the years, and avater comes out as around
a 30% dps increase.  30% is HUGE like you will never see such a leap again!

But even without the 100 to every melee stat, the 100ATK is HUGE.  If you
think primal is a ~30%dps increase, stackable damage throughout your guilds
melee, you can now kill mobs much faster than ever.  Kill mobs who you
couldn't before (eg huge ae but small hp fights), and kill mobs where you'd
never have had the mana before

In a word, no.

Btw there are other loots in ST again now, with the introduction of the
warders.
Off the top of my head..

priest masks with a focus effect of extended buffs
direct damage masks for int casters
flowing thought shields
priest boots, sightless velium eye.. and more
