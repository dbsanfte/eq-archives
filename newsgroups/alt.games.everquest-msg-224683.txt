I didn't finish my thought here: The problem unique to DOTs is that 
while you can cast that nuke that does 25% of the mob's HP total so it 
lands at 50% and thus get full use, if you land a DOT that would take 
out 2% per tic for 20 tics (a whopping 40% of the mob's HP total) even 
at 100% of the mob's health, if the mob dies in 10 tics then you only 
got in half your damage; now the DOT is doing 20% of the mob's total, 
less than that 25% nuke.

Shaman have two lines of DOTs, a relatively fast one that takes only 5 
or 7 tics to completion, and a slow one that takes what, 20?  30?  I 
forget, but its a lot to reach completion.  If our shamans stick to 
their fast lines and we pick large enough targets they should be able to 
contribute decently... but my point was that this sort of thing needs to 
be factored into our thinking.
