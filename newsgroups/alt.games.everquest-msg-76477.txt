Dark Elves have benefit of a high natural Int, ultravision and racial
sneak/hide (IIRC).  They are almost universally reviled, though.  They are
KOS in almost all of the Old World cities.

High Elves have a high natural Int and infravision as do gnomes.  Gnomes
that are agnostic seem to be accepted almost everywhere, while the elves
will be KOS in the evil cities.

Then there's that Erudites.  Very high Int, but nightblind (though that is
only a problem in dungeons that do not have continually burning torches,
now).  Accepted in most cities.

Humans are nightblind, but with a 75 base stat in everything, have no
significant disadvantages.

Take your choice.
