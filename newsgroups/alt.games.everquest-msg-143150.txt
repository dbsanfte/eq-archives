Just for the record, we've been fighting a *LOT* of chromodracs lately
and I can tell you that "first buff" thing is no longer true, if it ever
was. Even though we're fear kiting, so we dont' get dispelled every
time, there's always the occasional resist and and/or early fade fear. I
probably get debuffed three times an hour on average. It's hardly ever
the same slot or same buff twice. Appears to be completely random. It
takes my j-boots one time, dead man floating the next, and maybe my
manaskin (You BASTARD! Another peridot down the tubes) on the next. And
they aren't always in the same slots either.

That said, the more crap or instaclick replaceable buffs you have on
you, the lower the chances that a "good" buff will get taken, so it's
still a very positive thing.
