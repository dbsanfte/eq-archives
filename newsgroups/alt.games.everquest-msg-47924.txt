Record sales = record returns. Easy math.

No, I played the DAoC beta for  2 months.

The dev team has their head up their ass thinking they can release the game
while it still needs another 4-6 months of testing.

It has varied terrain...as long as you change realms. Within realms, it is
endless bland sameness, with occasional sparkles of something vaguely
different.

The classes are all almost direct clones of one another. The melee classes
in particular.

The problems with DAoC boil down to one simple thing: IT IS THE MOST BORING
GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. I have more fun playing tic-tac-toe than DAoC.
