The best general approach is to actually try it.  Just
have everyone bring a coffin and make sure you have
a necro available for summon corpse for the CR.

It's not like you'll lose all your stuff or even that much
XP.  If you're in HoT you've got a 56+ cleric and
someone probably has an SK or necro that can do
the summon corpse.

Get everyone together in a zone where they can bind
and make sure everyone is bound there, especially
the druids.   Then port in, run over, die, all pop-up at
bind spot (with the porter(s)) and you all run back,
get your corpses summoned, and resolve NOT to try
that again for a while.

/shrug

It's a game where you're constantly at bat, regardless of
how many strikes you get or outs you make.  As long as
you make it clear that they have to support the cost in
coffins, go for it.  If you lose badly, you just get your corpses
summoned and either try again or decide to put that off
for a few...
