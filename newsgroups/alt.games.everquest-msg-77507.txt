Getting multiple groups to work together in a coordinated fashion is
the hard part.  Our guild held the first large scale raid I'd ever
participated in (and I think the first for most of the others there),
and it was total chaos.  Effective communication, a well understood
goal, and a clearly defined plan are far more important than who is in
what group.  Everyone should be familiar with the zone.  Everyone will
know their job within their group, otherwise they couldn't have
reached their level, but now each group needs to know thier job within
the raid.  This concept will be new to people.

This is my limited experience.  Looking forward to hearing what others
with more experience have to say.
