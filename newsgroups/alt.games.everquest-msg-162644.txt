Fine. *Way* trivial was incorrect. How about "trivial enough"? If I am
good enough that I can't get better by making it, then I should be
successful more than 50% of the time, simply put.

Again with the "You've No Right to Complain because You've Not Lost as
Much as Me" club. I never even implied a concern for how much money it
cost me. It was negligible. I have every right to voice my opinion
that it's a flawed system, and that opinion is valid regardless of the
magnitude of my loss.

Sure. But then, my next 10 should produce a better success rate,
right? Or maybe the next 20? Or 40? That 1% rate gets thrown out the
window at some point when you continue to fail so often.
