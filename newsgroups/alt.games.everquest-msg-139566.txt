Yeah, that's what I did...but it gets expensive.  Spending points was
basically the only way to keep research up when I was at the research
levels, because the practice research system was broken--some of the things
needed for practice research did not drop.

The main problem was getting the damn runes.  Perhaps the Bazaar has made
that easier, or made it easier to find people who are selling the research
spells.

Probably what I'd do if I seriously wanted to do another research class is
go to the Bazaar with my Wizard, and try to buy all the important research
spells for the new class.  If I could find them all, then I'd start the new
class.
