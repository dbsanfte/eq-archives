Malachite is THE cheapest gem in the game. A mage can easily farm the
newbie zone outside of any city for enough silver and copper to buy a
stack of malachite. It wouldn't take more than 10-15mins.

Mages can summon food, bandages, bags, focus items, armor for their
pet, and magical weapons. 

No other class can outfit themselves as well from a totally naked
state. A mage could level 1-60 without buying a single piece of gear.

>Necros can fear kite petless. 

They cannot summon food or water, or any other items to help them or
their pet fight better.

>Beastlords get their pets without reagents, have good hth skills, and keep their pets healed damn well.

I would have ranked BL #1, but they lose out overall due to the fact
that they cannot bind, or gate. I am surprised so few people have
figured out how powerful the class is. My "start from scratch BL" on
the FV server fights 90% as effectively as my fully twinked (50+ monk
gear and weapons) one on my old server.

>Wizards don't need pets at all. Enchanters can charm something...

Both can fight naked, but they fall behind pet classes in overall
power if they are forced to fight naked.

>meleeing...

Monks are the premier Melee solo class, if they are properly twinked.
Untwinked they are decent, but only after they get FD and mend over
100.
