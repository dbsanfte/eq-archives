One tank (war, pal, sk)
One dedicated healer (dru, cle)
Two DPS (melee "dps" classes, wizard, mage...necro, I guess...since they
have pets)
One slower (enc, shm, brd, bst, epic rng)
One ANYTHING, though a druid would be great for CC, heals, snares, track,
NUKES

And, of course, if not covered above:
One pocket cleric and one pocket 60+ enchanter <g>

Track has little for completing your mission.  Once you get anywhere near
your Ass/Resc goal you start hearing commotions or yells for help.  For
nameds afterward, sure.
