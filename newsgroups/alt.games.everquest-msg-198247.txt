Previously, you could only click out of VP (which are situated behind big
badass dragons).  Or rez out.. make a corpse outside.. make one inside.. get
rezzed in, loot, then get rezzed out.  Major pita.

Guildie tracked it when the servers came up, said there is now way more
mobs, and a lot sees invis (nothing much saw invis prior)... I will give it
a shot i guess - just wish my shaman and girlf's cleric were keyed.

The last time I did VP, it was post-PoP as we were 65 (altho totally
spelless of all 65's, and most 63/64), we tried doing a single group.  Bard,
me (puller+tank), shaman, cleric, rogue, and Wizard.  We were doing ok
(melee for 500 was still a big thing then!) until a wurm split into 2 on
death, and they proceeded to eat the casters.  I don't know if mobs can
still split... but its a real bitch

It wasn't AoE groups (e.g pull 25 mobs whilst chanters chain stun, then PBAE
kill them) - it was bards, solo, pulling 40 mobs, spending 30 mins to kite
them in a big basement, and making multiple AA's in the process.

I do agree tho... it required some serious AA's, and some serious skill -
and seriously skilled bards are hard to find.  Why nerf something that was
only achieved via exceptional playing?

Or they will just drop the shitty torden(?) ring pouch every time! Yippe...?
You see that a lot in PoP, on many named.. pull a big badass yellow or red
con named, only for him to drop nuffin.  Bleh ;/
