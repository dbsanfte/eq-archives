> Difficult to program, for one thing.

Nah not really . Npcs use a diffrent base set of characteristics for atk def
dammage and ac . If a caster just went to the standard table when ld and
then dissappeared 30 seconds later it would work far better .

Right now going ld as a tank class dosent hurt at all . If you where gonna
die you still die , if you where going to live you still live .

A caster though always dies when going ld in combat. No matter how trivial
the combat was . If when ld he went to ac of 20L, atk 20L , dammage 2L like
a normal npc then he would only die if it was appropriate.
