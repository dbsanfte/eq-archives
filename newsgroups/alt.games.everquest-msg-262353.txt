I've done a lot of DC soloing, and I've found that DCed pet's regen
rate largely depends on the zone.

In Veksar, Acrylia Caverns, Nadox and Kael, a pet who is at 30-40% would
heal up to full in around four or five minutes.  (I'm going by memory
here, I might be off by a minute or so.)

In Old Seb and Nurga, resting for the same amount of time results in a
much lower gain in health.

So the general rule seems to be, if the zone is original Kunark or older
it gets the slow regen rate, otherwise it gets the fast regen rate.
