in EQ2 I made a character called Poodooo, it wasn't intended to be that word
at the begining but just a noise, a made up name.
after the talk about names etc. recently does anyone think that this name is
against the rules?
and if so how can I change it now I have made the Character? will a GM do it
for me?
Thanks
Ceri :o) (I'm not really that worried, I also haven't played since just
before xmas, I've kinda got into one of those, log in, not sure what to do
for 30 mins log out again times.)
