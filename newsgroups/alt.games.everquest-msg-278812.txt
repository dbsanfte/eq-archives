52 twink raiding isn't a very good guide.  Higher levels (yes, even just 2),
newer spells and gear from at least one extra expansion, etc., made it a far
different fight, thus why they level limited it to begin with.  I'm pretty
sure I could 3-box either of them now with a set of level 52 twinks (maybe
I'll try that someday, the guild lobby summoners make me brave).  As well,
with all of those mentioned and many many more, you look for ways to keep
clerics *out* of the AE so as to keep them CH'ing.  As I recall, Naggy was
often pulled to his doorway and the clerics stacked behind the walls on
either side of the door to avoid the AE.  I forget the details on Vox as I
did it a helluva lot less (and had a much worse ratio of wins even still).

With a smart tank, Trak can be MT'ed just fine and always could.  Just sit
down soon as you're tossed.  Regardless, you just have another warrior ready
to step up.  Gore required the efficiency of CH because the slow made it
such a long fight.  Sev...  well, I never had much luck with Sev back in the
day.  I've soloed him recently for revenge.   =)  The fear didn't go off
often enough to make CH a bad idea, though it was definitely supplemented by
spamming right after a fear to save the tank.

Velious really cemented the CH chain, no doubt.  Mobs like Vindi and AoW
just wouldn't be doable without it, and all raid mobs had exponentially more
hp to chew through, while dps upgrades didn't keep up.  Made for loooooong
fights.
