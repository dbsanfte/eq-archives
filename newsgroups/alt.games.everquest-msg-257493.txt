Not sure I like this... Given the lack of shadows, sometimes the only 
cue for the size/distance of a mob was the relative size of the name 
above it. If you couldn't see some mobs name, it meant it was BIG and it 
was FAR.

I think that the implementation of the DX9 engine was a missed 
opportunity to add at least lenticular shadows and some form of depth 
cueing.
