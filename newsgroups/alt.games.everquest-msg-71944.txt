I'll try to avoid saying anything biased :)

Either game will probably improve while you're playing the other- you may 
not be interested in playing both at once, but at some point, you may 
tire of one, and want to try the other.  I'm thinking it might be worth 
the extra initial cash to switch to whichever game your friends want to 
play.  For a lot of people, that's the most important aspect of any 
MMORPG.

DAOC isn't all PvP- it's actually mostly *not* PvP, with lots of people 
looking forward to it when they get high enough level.  And even at high 
level, most people spend the significant majority of thier game time 
playing PvE in thier own realm.

I don't know, I haven't played EQ in about 2 years, so I'm in no position 
to make any comparisons of that nature, I guess.  DAOC is a huge game 
world, but doesn't make the most optimal use of the space for levelling 
purposes- I think that might be the complaint you're catching onto, but 
it's not an issue untill after 30th level or so.  How fast do you plan on 
levelling, assuming a similar rate as in EQ?

> I'm enjoying the characters in EQ and the Quests.  But it seems like DAOC doesn't have the same component.

DAOC borrowed a lot from EQ- DAOC has named NPCs, named monsters, more 
quests than any MMORPG I've played, although they're still pretty simple 
(go to X location, kill monster Y, obtain item Z, return)  DAOC also has 
lots of character types and races, pretty comparable to EQ, AFAIK.

> So if I went with DAOC would I see the same game (more or less), better graphics, smaller world?

There are some differences in the gameplay itself, but not much, I guess, 
except for the RvR aspect.  Both games consist primarily of sitting 
around on a dungeon floor, fighting whatever the puller pulls, ad nauseam 
at higher levels, unless EQ has changed dramatically since I left.
