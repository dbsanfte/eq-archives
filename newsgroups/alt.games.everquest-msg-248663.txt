Not exactly. The big problem with mass transit is that it takes longer to
use it to get somewhere then a car does. Ever use a boat in everquest?
Waiting on the boat had to be one of the most annoying things in Eq. Yet
that boat left every 15 minutes far more reliably then mass transit ever
does.

The only places where mass transit works are areas with very dense
populations and inadequate roads. Well maybe the new levitation trains in
china that go 300 mph will add a new twist to the same equation.

You want me to go wait in an unsafe, crowded , smelly place for 30 minutes
to take a bus ride for 2 hrs to get someplace 30 minutes away? Sure wish
everybody else would do it and get off my damn roads.
