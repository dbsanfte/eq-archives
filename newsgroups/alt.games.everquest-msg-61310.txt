Was in Everfrost hunting Mammoths with a small group...  my Druid friend and
a Shamaness and myself.  We position ourselves near the Perma entrance near
the zone in order to bail if we get a bad pull.  We are very careful, but as
we all know, bad pulls can and do happen.  Anyway, I tracked several
mammoths so I ran out to pull one.  Crossed that part of the river to pull
from the area of land between the river forks.  Nowhere near the ruins.  At
anyrate, I pull this mammoth and am running her back to the perma area when
someone yells across the zone, "The ISLAND is camped!  Stop Kill Stealing
from us!"  I did an OOC and explained to them that I didn't see anyone
fighting that mam and I would never pull someone else's kill intentionally.
That was not what happened however as they then explained that THEY were
tracking the same mammoth and had approached to see me running it back to my
group.  All of this was in ooc across the zone.  I said to my group, Did
they just say that I stole something from them that wasn't really theirs to
begin with?  My group was pretty sure that was the case.  Before we could
respond, someone else in the zone told the other group to shut up since you
cannot camp an entire portion of the zone and someone else told them to go
right ahead and camp the ruins since nothing spawns there.  My partner said
Running around killing things does not equal camping and on it went.

I can't get over the gall of some players in this game.

However, there is another side to this coin.  I was hunting in SK yesterday
outside Splitpaw.  There was a Druid soloing at one of the spires.  We were
camping the middle spire.  Each and every time she needed to take a break to
med or whatever she would announce that she would be afk and that for the
next however many minutes, people were free to pull from the spire she was
in front of.  I was shocked!  Did I just hear someone willing to SHARE a
spawn???  I thought I was the only one in the game who would do that.
Apparently there are good players as well as idiots.  I just wish there were
more of the good than the bad when it comes to camping and KSing.  Of
course, as generous a player as this Druid was, she had 3 gnolls stolen from
her during the course of our battles in the zone.  Whatever.

I guess I just needed to vent... sorry to ramble.  In short, most everyone
is guilty of popping someone else's kill now and then.  I've done it several
times myself.  As soon as I realize my mistake, I back off and do an ooc
apology to whomever was fighting that target.  Mistakes can be forgiven.
Outright nasty cannot.
