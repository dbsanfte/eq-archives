As a stopgap measure they could just warp underworld mobs to their spawn
point.
I had this problem in WC when I was hunting lightstones for the adventurers
staff. Al the willowisps were clumped together under the world at one spot.
I just cast low level earthquake to release them.

Havnt tried COH but I did try lineage2 (since Ive canceled my eq
subscription... yeh I know I have no life posting here :P)
Lineage2 is realy nice graphics, but the xp/money treadmill is awful, and
the game is (consequently) full of bots.
Everywhere I went there was some uber twinked bot killing everything in 1 or
2 hits. I cant compete with a program that runs 24/7.
Unfortunately WOW isnt due out till te end of the year now, but maybe there
will be an open beta before then.
