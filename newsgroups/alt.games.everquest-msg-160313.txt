I wish they'd allow non English speakers to split off of the US servers...
There is a sizable French population on mine (they have like 4 guilds) and
they are annoying because only one in 30 will even admit they speak English.
I've even gotten into KS disputes with one group from one of the ... less
well reputationed guilds on our server, and they kept spouting French at the
GM, and pretended they could not understand what he was saying. (He finally
got through to them the next time they KS'd my group, while he was watching
(visible even) nuking the mob away after we had agro, by porting the entire
group to Arena and /silencing them for a few min... Though I got a long
stream of French about 10 min later.)
Now they may not understand English, but it seems to me it would be very
very hard to play this game without it, unlocallized, as every message that
the game sends you is written in English...
