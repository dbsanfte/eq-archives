If you think DAoC is going to offer more "substance beyond hack-and-slash" 
then I'm afraid you've got another think coming. It's going to be the same 
old formula, with the names changed to protect the guilty.

What I think is funny is how people are willing to go pay $13 a month for an 
EQ clone without any actual feedback about what the long-term gameplay is 
going to be like. Sure, I guess it's something to kill time on, and hey, 
maybe it WILL be great. Maybe.

When is someone going to actually make an MMO-ROLE-PG?
