Nothing wrong with Wurmy at all, *especially* before the main hand damage
bonus begins to kick in. At current prices its *insanely* good. On TT
at least it sells for 2k or so.

People lauigh at it because they're moronic idjuts who read about Furors
latest weapon and assume that uber at 60 means uber at level 1.

Duuuuh. Same holds true for a lot of the class arguments, actually. Sub
50 dont let anyone tell you you NEED that warrior. Hell, even post 50
you can generally get away with buffed secondary or even tertiary tanks.

I main tank in chardok and seb all the time - buffed have about 3500 hp,
1020 AC which sucks compared to a warrior but *is enough* to make CH
efficient enough for me to not cripple the group.

Anyhow... The real answer to your question is too many people quoting
websites without a fucking clue what they're talking about.
