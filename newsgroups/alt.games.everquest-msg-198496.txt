Normally, this occurs when there is an update to eqgame.exe and you have a
running firewall, such as Norton Internet Security.

If so, before you start the game, make a change to the status of eqgame.exe,
then change it back. For instance, set eqgame.exe to Automatic, then back to
Allow (for Norton).
