}> There are toilets in Oggok.  And there's a bathroom in Mistmoore.
}That little pool thingy in the little room upstairs in MMC?

Yea.  On our server at least, that camp has always been called as 
Bathroom.  People usually take the bedroom next door, as well.

}I've been in Oggok a lot without noticing any toilets, where are they?

Up near the top of the Shaman guild somewhere.  I haven't been there in 
ages.  And they're probably meant to be chairs, but they always looked 
like toilets to me.

Of course, the -real- toilet is the entire PoD zone. :)

}> Get out and explore a bit!
}Generally speaking, I think I explored it all during the years I played,
}with the exception of the higher end PoP zones that I never got access to.

Aww, chill, I'm just riffing off your deliberate misinterpretation of 
Faeandar's remark.  No real criticism of your explorations meant. :)
