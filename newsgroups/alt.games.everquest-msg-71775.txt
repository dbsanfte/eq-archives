And even that one, IMHO, won primarily because it glorified
the acting life (and writers, while lampooning
producers and directors).

Quick, now, what profession makes up the majority
of the voting Academy?  How could they *not* overwhelmingly

appreciate?

Pack the Academy with war veterans, on the other hand,
and Saving Private Ryan would have come out on top.
