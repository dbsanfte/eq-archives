The uber items are made by the crafters, can't people just forget the
idea of 'uber drops'?

Speak for yourself, I don't play games to 'show how superior I am'. 
I'm just there for fun.  So far, SWG has provided it.  I'm liking it a
lot, it's been two weekends already I haven't left my house, and any
free minute I can I play it.   I haven't had this fever since EQ. 
DAoC didn't do it, AO didn't either.
