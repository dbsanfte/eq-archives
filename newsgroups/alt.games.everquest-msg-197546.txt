Alright, I'll bite.

For the most part, I like playing EQ.  Recently, I started a wizard.
His Divination skill STINKS, because I don't cast many Divination
spells.  But when I do, I need them to WORK, not fizzle.

So tell me, how can I get my Divination skill up and make it not be
work?  Because, you know, chain casting some stupid lowbie Divination
spell to get the skill up so I can continue to enjoy the game sure
feels like work to me.
