Well to certain high levels 4k plat is peanuts and it takes a fair amount
of time to max a language (OK Ok we arent talking in the league of a big
raid but its still not a 5 minute hand in for an MQ).

Im told a bunch of quests require you to use the right language to trigger
the quest....high level quest, need for languag quickly, rare language
means demand for teachers - especialy since said teacher knows that each
person he trains can go train say an entire guild or do as you did if
really necessary. All he has got is the need to do it NOW on his side.
