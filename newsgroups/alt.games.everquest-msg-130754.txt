Hehe, if you wanna see BAD invisible walls, head to TD.
TD connect to IllOmen, but thats in the middle of the zone, so out in 
the ocean theres a big square of invisible wall (due to it being a zone 
line you cant cross while swimming). My monk found it getting a little 
too much to the left while running to the Iksar Master for the Shackle 
quests. Were AFK while swimming there, and when i got back, i were stuck 
at a location that i knew werent the zone line (think neg 3000 on the 
north/south barrier, and know that one go to 13000 or 14000), spend a 
few min before i found out what was wrong.
