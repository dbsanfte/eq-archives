For the same reason any class should group...  You learn how to do it.  The
higher end game isn't going to be about soloing, and anyone who grew up not
knowing how to work with other classes is going to be screwed.  45+ is not a
good time to learn that skill.

More importantly, you make connections and friendships, and those will help you
out a great deal in the game.  I've seen many lifetime soloists begging and
pleading and offering huge amounts of cash for help getting corpses or
rezzes--and I've seen many lifetime groupers who only had to ask a friend, and
aid came at no cost.  And when you finally decide (or need) to group, or when
you want to go to the planes, and it's between you and that other Ranger that
they know is a good group player?  You'll lose out every time.

That--the connections/friendships--alone is worth it.  If nothing else, group
part of the time for the learning experience and solo the rest of the time for
the blue-and-orange experience.
