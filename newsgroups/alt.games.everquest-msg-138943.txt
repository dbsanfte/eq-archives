They have a different attack (Tail Rake). It replaces one that Humans
get. It does the same damage and has the same recycle delay.

>Humans have.... hmm....well I'm sure you can think of something.

Iksar have longer FD animation.  Point Human

Iksar are hated everywhere in the old World and many parts of Luclin.
Point Human

Only 1 time in 53 levels did I have a problem with Human night
blindness. I had to kill a fire beetle outside Freeport for an eye,
because I couldn't see squat in Najena on a corpse run.

Regen is overrated (unless your monk is born with a Fungi.) Once you
hit level 20 a monk will rely on Bind Wounds to 50% then Mend (every 6
minutes) to 70%.

Buying regen with AA is a LOT easier than suffering a 20% exp penatly
from level 1-60. By the time you get to the levels where you start
playing with AA this is a huge advantage for Humans.

With equal skills and gear the Iksar will have an AC advantage. The
Human will have a faster bare-handed fist delay (1 point faster from
level 25 up)

Human vs Iksar is a VERY balanced trade-off overall. Min-Maxers with
PL/Fungi support will generally pick Iksar. Once either race hits the
end-game it all comes down to gear, and racial differences fade away.
