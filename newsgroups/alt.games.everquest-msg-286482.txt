Any xp you lost from death will be returned regardless of your shroud
so if you rez a shrouded corpse while not shrouded, or rez a normal
corpse while you're shrouded, you will get back the lost xp.  Also you
do not return to shrouded or undhrouded forum from the rez so if you
took goblin shroud to seb, unlocked, then died and got unshrouded and
rez, you will return as unshrouded.

There were a few exploits with the shrouds.  

This was a big nerf, before the nerf the xp you gained in shroud form,
is transferred to your normal form at your normal form's level.  Get a
level 5 shroud, grind in forgotten hall and you can walk away 10AA per
hour with no death penalty.  This was nerfed very hard and I think
some people who used macro program to afk grind were suspended.  Right
now the xp you gain is adjusted for shrouded level.  IOW for a level
70 player using level 5 shroud, no AA xp and maybe 1% normal xp per 6
hours session in forgotten hall.

Another major nerf: Before this year, you could shroud to level 5, buy
the cheapest summon stone in GL and get all your corpse back
regardless of the corpse's level.  Now you need to buy stone that is
correct for the unshrouded level.

Other exploits: shroud before you accept rez, then unshroud and you
don't have rez effect anymore.  This is probably still live and
probably won't get fixed as it's not ground breaking.  You're just
shaving a few minutes off the rez effect.

Also you can keep your summoned pet without the suspend minion aa.
Your pet with all buff and pet toys are preserved in shrouded form
even if you died while shrouded.  I do this because sometimes it's
hard to find a set of high level pet toys when I needed them.
