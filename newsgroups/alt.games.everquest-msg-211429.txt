The sooner I have my defensive AAs and am capable of tanking more reliably
in Teir 3, the happier I will be.  NOt that it wouldn't benefit the group
to have a smart good plate tank, but given the choice between a dumb plate
tank and a well-equipped, well-AAd ranger who knows how to position and
keep aggro, I would suggest the group opt for the ranger.  I end up
tanking anyways when there is a not-so-bright MT:

1. mob aggroes enchanter/shaman/nuker
2. Foxeye waits a few seconds to let the MT get the aggro
3. Foxeye doesn't want enchanter/shaman/nuker to bite it, so casts snare
4. Foxeye politely waits for the tank to then take aggro back from her
5. Foxeye waits
6. Foxeye waits some more
7. Mob dies
