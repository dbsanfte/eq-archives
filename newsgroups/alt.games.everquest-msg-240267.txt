It's only vicious if it's negative. I happen to like most of the ideas they
have 'liberated' from other devs. And those other devs could learn a thing
or two. Oh why must I be bound in the middle of the city? When I die, I'm
headed right back out (why not, I have all my gear in most of these games).
Let some spellcaster be able to bind me at the gate, so I can get on with my
life in a hurry.
