Have just made my first ever eq character hit level 30 any ideas where to
hunt next?
Often go solo as I wish to do trade skill (I know I must be mental) and I
find the loot easier to get and nobody gets upset when I stop for a while.
Now ive just hit 30 although the new skill and spells as a beast lord are
good the damage you take is tremendous and the resulting experience is
sooooo low.

Any ideas would be gratefully received

Thanks
