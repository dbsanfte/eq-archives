Here's the thing about Jaundiced bone, the lowest mob who drops a piece is
level 48 in Karnor's Castle.  Luckily, most pieces are fairly cheap, about
1 - 2k aside from the obvious BP and Legs, which go for 60-90k  on Fennin,
and the Bracers, which are also quite expensive.  I'd suggest you do the
Totemic quests, but some pieces will be difficult with you and a 34 druid.
