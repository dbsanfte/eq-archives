Nope.  The fact that there was no honourable method of gaining it at the
time simply *should have* meant that it wasn't to be used by any Paladin
(self-restraint, what a concept).  As the power suppression would only apply
while owning the weapon, it's not like it's a fatal error.  When I learned
that killing the Shin Lord was the only way of getting a Ghoulbane; I simply
gave up instantly on the idea of ever getting my Epic.  When the quest was
implemented, I had a Ghoulbane 2 days later.  No, ALL non-quest Ghoulbanes
should have the ability-suppression factor.  It should have been that every
so-called Paladin who got one should have suddenly found that, until he got
rid of the weapon, he had no magical / god-given abilities at all.

As for the KOS in PoG, I don't see the relevance (are there Paladins of
Tunare?), but I certainly wouldn't have any objections, and the same for the
Fiery Avenger turn-in.

Imagine, if you will, a world that had started with 2 types of rogues, one a
sneak specialist (Thief), the other a damage monster (Assassin).  Imagine
that poisons actually were varied and useful.  Imagine that ranged weapons
could be poisoned.  Now, just suppose that Assassins were focussed on making
DD and DoT poisons, had the ability to poison HtH weapons, and did things
like Backstab.  Thieves, on the other hand, focussed on making blindness,
sleep, snare, root, and debuff poisons, had the ability to poison HtH and
ranged weapons/arrows, but didn't do Backstabs.

Think you could find a viable use for both types of Rogue?

A Hospital Corpsman isn't channeling power from a God to do his healing;
he's channeling power from the Mayo Clinic.  I'm not removing the Shaman's
ability to heal / buff others, I'm simply making it harder when it's not a
member of his "tribe".

Yes, I believe that the factions with regard to Rallos Zek are somewhat
screwed up.  However, Rallos Zek still has nothing to do with *raising* the
dead, only with killing the living.
