Wow - thanks a heap for all that info. I haven't renewed my Allah's
subscription yet so couldn't look myself and I noticed a lot of the EQ sites
have fallen behind in updates so was reticent to jump right in. Is Allah's
still good updatewise?

I did some charming in Echo caverns last night and tried using the lowbie
Hide skill to break charm but that was not reliable and failed more often
than worked. I have a Wind instrument alreay in hand when charming so I
guess this is one thing I just need to twist in for the majority of the
time. I will definately pick up one of those goblin rings though, as lot's
of mobs in outdoor zones good for kiting are animals. Again - thanks for
that.

I haven't figured exactly what is happening with pet / victim targeting
exactly yet as it seems to have changed since I left. I think I used to have
to charm Mob1, target Mob2 and sick mob1 on him and retarget mob1 again for
the next charm cycle. Recharming used to require re-sicking pet back onto
target as well unless I took a hit off Mob2.

These days the charm seems to stay targeted on your original near death pet
even though you have changed target onto the now healthier mob. I think I
need to wait for charm to completely break before retargetting another mob
singing another cycle. Hmmn - maybe this is the way it always was as well -
my memory is pretty fuzzy with barding.
