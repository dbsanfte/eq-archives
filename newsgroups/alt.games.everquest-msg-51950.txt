Actually, a character won't ever have a *lot* of *spare* coin, as there are
constant costs of upkeep in DAoC.  But *relative* to a first level
character, they may well have a lot of spare coin.  I mean if a level 30
twinks down a few gold to a level 1 that will buy him some awesome starting
equipment for his level.  So, I don't think twinking has been completely
eliminated, but it has certainly been brough under a fair degree of control.

It is also much more difficult to twink since you can't drop something on
the ground with one character and pick it up with another.  As Dan said,
twinking would require two accounts or some very trusted friends.

Still, hopefully, that gear that is bought by the first level player will be
bought from trade skillers.  I have high hopes for the economy in DAoC.

Best Regards
