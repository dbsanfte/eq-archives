}>Warrior:
}>- Not taunting before breaking mezz
}On a mob that doesn't give an actual message upon a successful taunt
}(ie: 99% of eq mobs) how would a warrior know whether his button mashing
}had been successful or not? I could taunt 10 times, and still not be
}successful, while the rest of the group stands around tapping their
}feet.

Aye.  I -think- you can check for success by assisting the mob, if you 
really want to.  The way to tell if the warrior is not taunting is if the 
enchanter gets wailed on -every- time you break a mez instead of oh, just 
most of the time.

}If it's an easy group, I'll break every mes the second I'm ready to
}engage, firstly with slam, then taunt, disarm, autoattack mashing. it's
}really not worth standing around taunting if the group is ready to kill.
}If you're standing around anyway to space a spawn, by all means
}taunt/disarm.

Many times, I'd appreciate you not taunting, actually.  If I'm using AE mez, 
I still manage to screw up and mez myself a fair bit, so if the mob comes 
over and whacks me, it'll wake me back up.  But in general, taunt is good. 
:)

}If the enchanter doesn't want to get hit, he should be memblurring, not
}relying on a warrior's taunt, which can fail as much as (parsed) 94% of
}the time. By all means tell the warrior to hold until you've slowed,
}tashed, crippled, and then memblurred before breaking mess if it's
}imperative you don't get hit.

Memblurring is an incredible waste of mana for that purpose.  You see, it 
fails about as often as taunt does.  But taunt is free.  Cripple is also 
pretty much a waste of mana.  Mez also has a memblur component, so if I 
don't have to debuff further after the mez, there is a slight chance the 
taunt is unnecessary.  But I wouldn't rely on it.  In general, I'd say one 
taunt tends to work about 30% of the time, two taunts about 95%.  But I 
haven't parsed a particularly unlucky streak.

Either take the fraction of a second to taunt, or, if you really want me to 
memblur, realize you can't pull as fast because I am going to have to med.

}What defines bad play? 
}Not working with your group. Simple as that.

Yup, good answer, but I think the OP wanted more specifics.

}A bard playing manasong during a pull would be a 'good' player?

No, manasong while you're out pulling, not when the pull actually arrives.
