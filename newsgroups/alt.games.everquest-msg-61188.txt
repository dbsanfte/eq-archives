To clear the air on this, since I didn't originally have the words to
try to research it, I made the run to Free Rot to check it out. The ogre
merchants outside conned ok to me for some reason, but the bouncers were
scowling. I was debating my options on the path down the hill from the
entrance when I suddenly saw a DE run past at SoW speed heading for the
gates. I caught his name and shot him a tell. He was kind enough to grab
me two copies of the level 20 pet spell, for which I tipped him
handsomely. Problem solved. 

The other ones I was able to research to get the full compliment of
spells. One future stopgap will be avoided, as I met a nice female DE
necro in W. Commons some levels ago who just *gifted* me with the 29 pet
spell, saying it was a real pain to get. You meet some of the nicest
people in the evil/death related trades, ya know? ;-)
