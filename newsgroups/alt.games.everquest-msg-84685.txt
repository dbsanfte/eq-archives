Ok, last night I talked our usual guild grind group into heading up to
the moon to see what's up there.

Holy social aggro, batman!

We were:
40 Cleric
44 Warrior
40 Warrior
45 (or 44?) Shaman
50 Druid

Future efforts could include a slightly younger warrior, a 43 wizard
and/or a upper 40s SK...

We ended up putzing around in Dawnshroud for most of the time - was
interesting, often times didn't have to pull what with wolves 'leaping
out from the bushes' and popping on us!  Highly social dinosaurs and
shroom as well... Was kinda fun, but we were living on the edge a
couple times there!

For a group around that range, any thoughts on other places up there
(where there = Luclin) to be?  I think we can make Dawnshroud work if
we find a better pulling station, but had to wade through a fair
amount of tough green and cyan kills.
