I think you need DX 9 support in the hardware. I just got a new Nvidia card
recently and that was one of the selling points of the thing, that it had
support for DX 9 features in the card. You can probably get a DX 9 card
these days for somewhere around one hundred fifty bucks on the low end if
you want, which would be quite an improvement over what you have now. A good
source for mail order that I like to use by the way is www.newegg.com I have
no relationship to them, just thought I would let you know they are out
there.

I don't know anything about old Voodoo cards. But I am guessing they would
not use an AGP slot? Does your PC have an AGP slot for a newer card?
