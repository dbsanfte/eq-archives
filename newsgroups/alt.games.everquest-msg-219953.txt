    Easy rule: songs stack with spells, always. Not many exceptions to that,
and the ones I can think of are ones where it's obvious (like that Selo's
thing that does a short buff wiping out SoW).

    My guild no longer needs as many bards. As long as we have enough to get
AE resists/mana on everyone, and one for overhaste/group resists on the main
tank, we're fine. Would Rizlona's be nice on a group of wizards? Yes, it
would. But that means the bard is just DPS, and we're going to look at that
DPS versus the DPS of another wizard, or a ranger, or a rogue, when deciding
who to recruit next. And something tells me the bard won't win that fight.
