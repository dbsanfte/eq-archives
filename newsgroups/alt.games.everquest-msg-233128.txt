I have the same problem; same response.  My additional question is,
I've heard that the bag can be "upgraded" in several steps until it
is 100% WR.  My monk is slavering at the very thought.  (Well, he's
an Iksar, so he sorta slavers a lot in any case. :-)  Does this
upgrade involve LDoN adventures, and if so, do I have to have the
bag already when I do those adventures, or does it simply improve as
I accumulate adventure points?

Since I get to split my game time among LDoN, tradeskilling, and
various faction-improvement quests, I've been mostly avoiding the
dungeons while waiting for the /claim bug to be fixed, because I
didn't want to "lose" potential upgrades to the bag.  Am I right
to worry, or should I just go ahead and dive into the dungeons?
