I dont know what they did but it seems to me it was something along the
lines of giving every PoP mob a chance to drop an ethereal that goes up
slightly with the mobs level.  At some level, the mob gains a chance to
drop a spectral parchment.

Last night in PoN we got 3 parchments in 3 hours which was way better
than I've ever seen at any camp outside of the basement in PoJ
pre-patch.
