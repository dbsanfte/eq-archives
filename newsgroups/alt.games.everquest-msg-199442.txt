Well, you may not consider it, but many Druids have done it, and back
before Elysian was a gleam in some dev's eye.  Druids with gear that
was notably inferior to what my Druid on FV wears used the porcupine
tactic in Sol A and elsewhere in their 30s.  Now my Druid on FV has a
175 Defense (that's pre-50 cap, correct?) so he doesn't let anything
beat on him anymore, but while he was levelling up he melee'd at the
start of each level until his Defense hit level cap.  I suppose its
time I got him a better wis/mana/hp item for his primary hand tho, he
never attacks anything anymore except as a "take that you jerk" sort
of thing from behind once a mob that snuck in a hit on him goes snare
dumb (Riposte hurts!).
