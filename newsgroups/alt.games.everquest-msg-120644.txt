Not everyone enjoys exploring dangerous zones.  There's only two under-50
fun zones on that continent (CC & ToFS), and one of them is in BFE.

I'm not speaking for me...I know Velious pretty well...I have since my
enchanter was level 40 or so, and I've been known to hunt in GD in the 20s,
but I don't expect everyone else to know such a BORING-ASSED-looking
continent like that.  Miles and miles of Everfrost....
