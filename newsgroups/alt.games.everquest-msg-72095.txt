I have recently heard in a couple different places about AMD processors having
problems with locking up. I have been thinking of upgrading my computer. Mostly
upgrading the CPU and motherboard. Right now I'm using an AMD K6-2 500 mhz. I
had been thinking of getting an AMD Athlon, but after hearing this, I'm
wondering.. would a Pentium be a better choice?  Or do I really need to do this
upgrade? I know I need to upgrade my graphics card and add RAM. 

Would it help to upgrade to WinXP?  Right now I'm using Win 98 SE.  Sorry for
being slightly off topic. I would sure appreciate any info on this.
