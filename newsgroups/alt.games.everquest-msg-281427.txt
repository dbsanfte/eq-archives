The monster mission cheats are spelling the end of EQ. People who have 
been loyal and enthusiatic players are leaving. You can't expect people 
to stay enthusiastic about a game after spending a couple of years 
developing a toon and have some newb able to pass it up in a couple of 
months with MMs.

When 20+ AAs can be had in a day without even having to be at the 
computer it makes a joke of the hard work put into toons by people who've 
been playing for years. Used to be that if you said you had 400 AAs it 
was respectable. Now people shrug and say "I got that many last month 
while I slept".

Many people in my guild have quit EQ, and many friends I've talked to 
said they are going to if something isn't done. These are just those I 
know. That means there are a great many more. 

Unless Sony does something really radical really soon like taking the 
time and trouble to find what AAs were from MMs and taking them away from 
regular toons and making them applicable only to MM toons we'll soon see 
the death throes of EQ1. They can't turn it into an easy teenie bopperish 
game like EQ2 and expect the long term players to stick around.

E-bayers get ready. There will likely soon be a large amount of very high 
level toons available. Of course, you'll just use them to whip through 
the zones and yell "Yay! I done EQ!" and cancel because you're not proud 
of a toon you worked hard for, but no one really loses but Sony who 
deserves it for being so short sighted. As soon as some newb uses MMs to 
pass my 600+ AAs I'll sure cancell in a hurry. Want a 70 chanter with 637 
AAs? It won't be anything special soon, though. Any idiot can do it with 
MMs. You'll be passed quickly unless you cheat too, even though it's 
taken nearly 3 yrs. to build.

Bad move Sony! That was really dumb. Your loss, as your records show I'm 
sure. If not yet, they soon will.
