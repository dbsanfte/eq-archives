Those are some of the fairly high end cash gems (dating back to original
EQ of course) that drop in the game, and they drop in the zones you
would expect them to from that perspective. You'll see a fair number in
Old Sebilis, particularly at the guard camp and a few other camps. Plane
of Growth is insane for them, the most I've seen in fact. Hate can also
bag a lot of gems while you're clearing the first floor trash. In my
experience, those are about the three best spots for BD's. Diamonds
follow suit. Rubies drop in a few more places than that, e.g. I've
gotten them off random mobs deeper in The Hole.

Level? These are all zones for high forties at a minimum, fifty plus
preferably, and of course you won't be soloing any of them except in
very bazaar and unusual circumstances.
