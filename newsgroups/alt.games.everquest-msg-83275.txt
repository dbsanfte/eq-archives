First of all u didn't even address the real issues of my earlier post. Game
Programmers are leaving verant. First clue here is that point Most say its
personal issues or better offers. In the gaming world that means I don't
like the way this company is heading. This post was a warning that service
on EQ is not going to get better but worst most of the people who started eq
and loved the game that they created are gone or packing up. the first ones
to know that the ship is sinking is the crew. Have u tried lately to get
help on a chatroom. nearly impossible as far as the numbers on sat. night go
DAOC is new and EQ is old keep watching i bet u will see the numbers start
changing more and more every week. So to my point is Programmers leaving,
Poor Customer service, Bugged Luclin, and the age of EQ are all warning
signs that continuing to invest monies into eq may not be very beneficial
