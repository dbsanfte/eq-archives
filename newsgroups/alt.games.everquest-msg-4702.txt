Yep, and he is succeeding, likely beyond his wildest dreams. I've
nowhere near your 20 years in online discusions, but I've been around.
I've never seen any ng that had so many people jump on the trolls'
hooks as a.g.e. has recently. 

Right now the FA trolls own this ng. Any sort of stupid post they make
is almost guaranteed to draw at least 100 responses, including those
from people, such as yourself, who should know better. Even if you
don't reply directly to their posts, you're still feeding them.  Of
course I can now be added to this as well. :P It's kinda pathetic how
easily people here are trolled, these gimps would be reduced to ashes
if they tried this crap in alt.slack. 

And no, I'm not the me who has been trolling here recently, I'm an
entirely different one.
