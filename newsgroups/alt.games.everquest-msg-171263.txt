Err, i probably missed something, but exactly how does the nerf hurt 
wizards?

As manaburn were (mis)used before:
6 wizards teamp up, use MB to be able to beat up every 32K HP mob in the 
game within a few seconds. This were used by some greedy people to take 
several epic pieces "hostage", meaning that if you wanted your epic, you 
had better save up a few 100K to buy the pieces from 32K mobs, since the 
servers Team MB would be the only one able to get them.
On my server, FoH had a MB team that basically held Gore and a few other 
mobs hostage for a few months, untill the nerf. They would have a 
spotter in DL, then the MB team would leave SSRa and go kill Gore 
(disregarding any normal guilds gathering of course), and kill Gore, 
then port back to SSra and get CoHed back to their own raid. Since most 
guilds that need Gore need a 3-4 group raid + buffing and sorting 
groups, MB Teams are able to move faster, and thus beat the raid force 
sitting and buffing up. For my guild, that meant seeing 3 pops of Gore 
in a row being taken by team MB while we were buffing up.
As example take a look at this page, shows exactly WHY they nerfed manaburn.

As manaburn are used now in raids:
Basically, unless its a mob that REALLY need to go down fast (Trakanon 
is a good example of this), its way better for the wizard to use normal 
nukes. My guild had quite a success with having 3 MB wizards, since they 
just find out who are gonna do the MB, and the 2 others nuke like mad, 
and mob goes down. Basically MB is now a way to get a big chunk of mobs 
HP gone fast.

As manaburn are used now in groups (and you complain aboiut wizards not 
getting groups):
Never met a wizard who tried to use MB in a group. You loose all your 
mana, so will hurt group for the next 5 min till your medded up again, 
and your normal nukes would be a LOT more effective.
Would like input here though, any wizards ever been using MB in a normal 
XP group?
