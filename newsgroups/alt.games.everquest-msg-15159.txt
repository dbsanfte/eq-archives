Generally this works, but I have found problems using PAT/NAT overload
on Cisco routers.  I eventually ended up completely revamping the
internal network at a previous workplace because Everquest wouldn't
work.  I did fix a bunch of other problems, and learned a bit more
about LANs (real network engineers only care about WANs).  If you're
using a true 1-to-1 NAT everything should work fine; if you're using
1-to-many NAT (PAT), then there is a slight chance you may experience
problems.  Upgrading to the newest version of NAT code should fix it
in most cases.
