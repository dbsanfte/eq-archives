Huh? the red scales are by far the easiest to get . Ragefire , naggy ,
talendor all drop them and all are fairly easy for dragons .

The hard parts of the warrior epic is the spiroc lords blade , the blade
from the queen in chardok , and the golem ball from fear .

If you are actually doing the bard epic instead , concentrate on the white
scale , that is by far the hardest to get .
