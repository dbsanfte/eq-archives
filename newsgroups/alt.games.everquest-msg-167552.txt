After which, NVidia will release their next one which will be better yet,
and so on.  Best advice I can give is get the best one that fits within your
budget.  Either one will work very well for EQ and most other games.  Sure,
one or the other will be somewhat better, but, next month, there will be yet
another newer and better one.  And if you wait just a bit longer...
