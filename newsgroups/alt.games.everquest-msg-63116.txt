I can top that for weirdness...I've seen parts of zones that were
mysteriously lossy.  For example, I was in Rivervale once, and if I
got near the PoD, my packet loss would shoot up to 30-40 percent.  If
I ran back toward the Misty zone, it would drop back to 0.  I went
back and forth about 10 times, and every time, when I got near the
PoD, the packet loss went back up, and every time, when I went back
toward the zone, it went down.

To make sure that there wasn't just some periodic lag spike that
happened to have a period equal to the time it takes me to run between
the zone and the PoD, I then grabbed a D6 from my D&D dice, and
rolled, and multiplied the result by 10, and waited that many seconds
before going back to the PoD.  At the PoD, I did the same thing to
decide how long to stay before going back to the zone.  I did this
about 10 times, rolling at both ends to generate a random time from 10
to 60 seconds.  The packet loss continued to jump when I got near the
PoD, and drop when I left.

There were only a couple other people in the zone during this, and
they weren't casting spells or doing anything else I could see that
would induce packet loss.

I've seen a similar thing in Cabilis, near the trainers in the Shaman
guild (which was very annoying for my Shaman!).
