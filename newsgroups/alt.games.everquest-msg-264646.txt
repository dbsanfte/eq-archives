What would be the point? AO is Funcom's only MMORPG after Midgard was
put in the freezer, and the same goes for Shadowbane and Wolfpack. 

I notice below that you meant that they "pooled" together for such a
service. Remember the smaller subscription base means they need the
whole subscription fee more than big SOE, which has better economies
of scale due to their EQholics.

No, and the reason is called the Prisoner's Dilemma. The company can
either 

1) Join in a "multiaccess" partnership with X others, and get
   $A/X+1, with potentially the same - or more - customers using CS
   resources, or

2) Go it alone and receive $B, where $B is probably less than $A but
   more than their cut of it.

Also, being the first to propose that to another company will be
interpreted as saying "we don't believe our game can go it alone and
want to ride your game's coat-tails."

That would mean replacing the multiple billing systems with one
centralized one, and either route all gameplay traffic through some
proxy, or trust the game servers to report client connection times to
a register, and trust the game clients to validate with the same to
prevent an account from "multiplaying". I don't think any of the
existing smaller players would want to take the risk.

See, even with this system the companies can lose out. If an AO player
plays only 10 hr/month, Funcom still gets the full $8-$15. But under
your system, if that 10-hour player spends 40 hours playing
Shadowbane, Funcom will only see 1/5 of the combined (say, $20) fee
($4). That player can still generate as much CS costs as someone who
subscribed exclusively.
