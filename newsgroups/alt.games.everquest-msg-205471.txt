Assuming you meant stamina there.  I have the opposite experience, and, 
believe me, I have done a lot of swimming, as I used to use the TD fire 
pots for transportation a lot.  Never had EB, and, depending on the alt, 
no levitate or sow, just swim to the spires, swim down, fall to the 
floor, click on the pot.  It's a very long swim from any of the zone in 
spots to TD. My main has always had stamina over 100, my alts mostly do 
not, except for the warrior I believe.
