Most you dont need.
I wouldnt buy Pogonip, Resist fire, Dismiss summoned (unless you need it
obviously), Sunbeam, Spirit of cheetah, Charm animals, tremor.
Wolfform is also of questionable use since it doesnt work with treeform
(your cheapest self heal)
Looks cool tho and the faction can be useful (brownies anyone?)
