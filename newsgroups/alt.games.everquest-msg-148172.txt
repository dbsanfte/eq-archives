I spent quite a long time in the Bazaar yesterday evening (about 10PM-12AM
Central Time).  Compared some prices and what I could afford with about
500pp.  Here is what I bought.  I'm a LV23 Dark Elf Necromancer.

HEAD: Savant's Cap - 2 AC
+3 INT, +3 WIS
Effect - Reagent Conservation II
30pp

FACE: Blood Weave Veil - 4 AC
+2 INT, +2 STR, +2 AGI, +1 WIS, +1 SV Poison, -2 SV Fire, +2 Disease
125pp

BACK: Kunzar Cloak - 2 AC
+2 INT, +2 WIS, +7 MANA, +10 SV Fire,
90pp (saw it for 2pp but didn't get to the guy in time)

WRIST: Polished Bone Bracelet - 2 AC
+3 INT, +3 WIS
100pp each, bought 2 of them

NECK: Golden Star Amulet
+4 INT
50pp

I currently own an Advisor's robe (+5 INT, +20 MANA, 8 AC, +2 AGI, +5 SV
Magic), but can also buy a Green Silken Drape (+3 INT, 8 AC, +9 DEX, +9 STA,
+15 SV Poison, Effect = Affliction Hast II) for 50pp (saw a few selling them
for various prices, 50pp being lowest.  At my LV, given the formula of "Mana
= INT*LV/5", then the 2 INT I'll lose only lowers me 9.2 mana and I lose
another 2 AGI but gain 9 DEX & 9 STA, then the +15 poison resist, and the
hast II effect.  Is it worth an inventory slot just to carry around?

Anything else I should save up for?  I'm currently in ill omen hunting
goblins when I can find them, also sarnics too.  I've gained a few pp, as
most mobs drop at least 5+ gold, with the occasional 2-3pp.  I hope I can
start gaining more pp soon because this being my highest LV character (and
no one to transfer coin/items with anyway), I'm not in position to have a
higher LV kill a few mobs & twink me with coin.
