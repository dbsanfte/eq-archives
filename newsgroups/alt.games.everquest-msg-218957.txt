A real man would just admit his fault and apologize.  But noooo,
you have to keep at it.  Loser.  I never whined *once* about my
failure rate being too high.  My comments were *always* in the context
of saying it was odd that you can't improve anymore even with a 1/3
failure rate.

Nobody's accused me of trolling yet.  Inventing more bullshit,
Darkspanky?  Quit while you're ahead.
