$12.95 now, about $17.95 later.  That with the fact that the "customer
support" crew is shrinking at astronomical rates, servers looking for senior
guides, newly appointed elder type guides, etc.  Sooner or later, the
continuous mandatory upgrading, increased rates for LESS service and the
lack of content will bring the fall of EQ1.

Speaking of Business 101, just how much longer does a product or the
manufacturer thereof fair when everything above is said then done?

It's quite simple really.  The entire point of MY inital post is that Verant
is getting lazy unfortunately and cheap.  Will this bring the entire company
down to its knees entirely?  Nope.  Though, it sure as hell will open the
doors for other companies to rip them to shreads sooner or later,
unfortunately, I forsee it being sooner than later.

Don't take my words as if I -want- to see this happen, however, as
a -realist- I can admit and -see- that it's going to.

You wondered just how I "assumed" it would take all but 5 or so hours to
"re-patch" the zones in which the Holloween events were in last year.  Good
question, however, even with minimal programming experience and some logic
(which many more than few that read these newsgroups have) one can easily
conclude that since the servers WERE down for 4 or so hours the night before
Holloween to implement an entirely NEW zone "re-patch" (ie. Swamp of No
Hope), just how long would it have taken to "re-patch" zones for which they
already had tested and proven zone "re-patch's" for?

Create 50 text files using a standard name set within a directory once.
Copy paste those text files to a new directory.  Change the contents of
those text files in the new directory so that they are "different."  Now,
copy paste those newly changed text files by the same name of those found in
the original directory, into the original directory, overwriting the
original text files.  Guess what?  You just did a "re-patch."

In essence, its apparent by the current trend of laziness that Verant is
caring less and less of its game and it's customer base.  Business 101, you
are a dollar sign.
