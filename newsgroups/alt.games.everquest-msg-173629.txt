> And still not a single one seems to "Grab that BST looking for
group!!"....

You know, I think it's just a matter of not very many people really
understanding the power of a BST.  Every time I've grouped people have been
amazed at what I can do (and I'm only lvl 31).  But a lot of people I've
asked to group ask me what class, I tell them BST, and they're like, naw,
that's ok, we'll find someone else.  We kick ass, though, as people who've
actually grouped with one of us knows.
