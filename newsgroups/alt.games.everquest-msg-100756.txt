I'm sorry, but I have to stop by and add this...

If you plan to get into a future career of Usenet flaming, you really
need to hang back and read a LOT more. Look, I'm not dissing you for
trying. Hell, there's people that seem to have made a lifetime goal out
of flaming Bizbee. But that was one of the lamest attempts I've ever
read. Really.

You could have at least worked in a couple veiled comments about his
mother or his ambiguous sexual preferences, or ..... something.
*Anything*.

Sorry, but I have to give your paper a failing grade. Bring in a new one
tomorrow. This time, with *feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeling*.
