Thanks - you made my day, best laugh I have had in a long time. Good to see
being a jerkoff doesn't always pay...

Will paste the good bit below:

"Five rough-looking men stepped out of a black sedan and burst into the
Seoul PC cafï¿½ where Paek Jung Yul hangs out with Strong People Blood Pledge,
his clan of online gamers. "Is the wizard here?" demanded one of the toughs,
asking for the player who killed his character in an online game called
Lineage. The "wizard" was there, alright, and he was feeling bold. He
boasted that he had offed the gangman's virtual character just for the fun
of it. Bad idea. The roughnecks dragged the 21-year-old into the urinal and
pummeled him until he was covered with real-world bruises."
