Well, I was thinking of a file on your own computer kinda like the 
friends/ignore file. This would be much easier for soe to implement and thus 
more of a chance of it actually happening. It would also be portable too so 
you could copy it from account to account and puter to puter. In order to 
have an account tagged it would have to be server side. Also there's always 
the slim chance that the person who was stupid in one encounter may have 
eventually learned their lesson and figured out how to play the game. Or 
their main was a cleric/wizzy etc that usually sat and casted and you 
happened to get stuck with the alt tank that they didn't play too much.
