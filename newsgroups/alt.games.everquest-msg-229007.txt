Are you suggesting we give stuff to random people in the zone? Why would
I notice them, first, we're talking about Sol Ro tower, not Sebilis.
It's a bring your own group zone, and we already had a full group. If we
had a spot and a guild monk was looking, he'd have got it.

Actually the flowing water staff is still going for 80-120k on my
server. Guess people like it better.

Maybe some familiarity with what you're discussing would help here.
Chitinous drops like candy in a part of a zone no one hunts in. If you
happen to have crappy luck on the vt shard dropping, it's quite easy to
walk away with 3 or 4 belts and 2 or 3 legs _each_. Yet, again if you're
doing vt shards before most other guilds on your server have, you have
items that are still relatively valuable for people who can't get them
themselves. Most of the time you're saying "someone loot those legs
before they rot". Of course it's easier to imply I'm somehow ripping off
a guild group, rather than having sat in that boring camp for about 60
hours helping others after already having got my shard.
