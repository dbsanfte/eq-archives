Are you kidding? I play on Vallon-Zek and After the first bad pull if there
had been no apology or change in behavior there would have been a can of
whoop-ass opened on this guy (If we couldn't have taken him out we'd have
informed every person high enough to do so within a 3 zone radius of his
actions). Kiter's have a responsibilty to not pull mobs across the path of
others. Repeated Intentional EXP loss is grounds for getting people
banned/suspended on our server (not sure on the nice servers I've been on VZ
too long). If that person was a GM they were ill informed of the rules.
