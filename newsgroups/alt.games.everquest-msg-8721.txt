I think I suceeded in beating out everyone in the stupidity department on
Friday evening.

Went to Permafrost for the first time early Friday evening to meet up with a
couple of Guild members...forgot to bind on the way in so one of my group
said "go ahead and bind here in this room...it's safe." We were camping the
Goblin Preacher for the Runed Circlet which is an extremely BORING camp.
After about an hour and a half of killing green gobs we were getting REALLY
bored and decided to go check out the Kings room.

It got really ugly and even though the mobs were all green we all the sudden
found we were fighting off 6 or 7 at a time and they just kept
coming...chanter dropped first and the entire group agro'd on me at
once...ranger tried to save me but couldn't in time...respawned in what I
thought was a safe spot only to get killed in a matter of
seconds...respawned again and tried to quickly mem FD...got it off but it
didn't work...they killed me anyways. Guild member shouted to pull the plug,
so I ctrl alt del the game and figured I'd come back in 20 minutes and see
if I was off the hate list.

Well...10 minutes later I came back and got ready to fire up EQ
again...clicked on the icon and the game immediately opened up. I hadn't
close the application...I had only minimized it. I was standing in a huge
pile of my own corpses. I finally made a run for it with literally almost
every gob in Permafrost on my tail and made it to the zone with a sliver of
HP left.

When I went into Perma I was 2 bulbs into lvl 31. I finally got to a safe
place to med and saw that I was now less than half into lvl 30. It took 9
lvl 57 rez's just to get ding 31 again, which is where I finally stopped.
When I finally left the dungeon about an hour later I passed about 4 more of
my corpse on the way out.

NEVER bind in a dungeon no matter how safe you THINK it is...
