I wasn't sure what to snip, so I didn't snip anything.  By my understanding
what your saying is that the giants give low amounts of exp and high amounts of
loot to make up for it because they are in a low level zone?  So if you were to
put those EXACT same giants into the Overthere you might get that great loot
AND awesome EXP because the zone multiplier makes the final outcome and the
level of a mob is the constant? 
 
   Interesting if true, good way of doing it to. I always just assumed each mob
was given an experience number from birth much like the Diku-Muds of the past.
