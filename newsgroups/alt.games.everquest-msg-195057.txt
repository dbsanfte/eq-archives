On average its once every couple weeks.  Sometimes its several days in a
row, when they do a large patch, then discover that they messed something
up and have to patch and patch to try and fix it.

They try to patch during the least used time of day, but some of us end
up caught with that being our main play time.

It is frustrating, and the fact that they don't have a web page or other
mechanism that accurately tells you when you -can- log in is even more
so, but you get over it eventually.  Just one of those things.
