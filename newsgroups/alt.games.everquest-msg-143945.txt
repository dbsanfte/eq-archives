if I considered someone to be a friend, and I had an extra pair of boots of
flowing slime, you'd better believe they'd be given to a friend FOR FREE.

Without my friends in this game, I wouldn't be where I am.

If I had an extra copy of Sunstrike, I have several wizard friends who would
love to have it, and nothing would please me more than to be able to give it to
one of them for free.
