Haven't read the constitution lately, have you?

I don't have an exact quote right now, but this is about how it reads:

1 - In a time of war, where the state raises its own militia,
2 - The citizens have the right to keep and bear arms,
3 - And this right cannot be taken away.

Most people read lines 2 and 3 and ignore #1. That's where this whole
argument comes from. People bending the truth to their own ideas. We
Americans do NOT have the right to keep and bear arms all the time. We have
the right to keep and bear arms if there's a war and the state requires a
militia made of citizens, which is no longer needed because we have an army.

If I remember, I'll grab the exact quote from the constitution and post it
tomorrow, unless someone beats me to it. =)
