My main is a 54 Shaman and his wisdom is only 187 and hasn't moved since
about 48 I think, and won't.  Go to any Mana calculator (Castersrealm
etc...) and enter in numbers and you'll see that the difference in lets say
a lvl 50 with 185 Wis and a lvl 50 with 200 Wis is about at best (don't
remember the exact number since its been a long time since I did this) is
about 80 to 100 mana.  Big deal.  With 200 Wis I'd be able to cast 2 more
SOW's.... Wow!  The majority of the spells I use are 150 to 350 mana per
pop, or more!  So even if another 13 Wis got me an additional 200 mana I can
live without it.

At about 48 I started upgrading gear to get AC up since I don't like getting
hit for 165+ a wack.  Especially with only 1600 HP's.  At 817 AC I don't get
hit every time and with a mob slowed 75%, if they pass my pet after I've
pulled them and argo on me I just stand there a few seconds and take 200 or
300 HP's dmg at most until the pet pulls them off me.  No big deal.

As a Cleric you'll want to get your Wis up to at least 170/180 but also try
and get gear with AC along with the Wis... it can be done but probably not
until your in your 40's playing somewhere like DL.  Anytime I lead a group I
make it manditory that casters (especially Clerics) get to loot equally with
the melee's... this really becomes important when you start playing in zones
with better loot.  In DL for example theres a fairly common tunic that drops
off Giants (can't remember its name as its been a while since I've played
there) that sells at a vendors for about 60/64 plat and KC's loot rocks....
just left there 3 or 4 months ago and made about 3K net in 2 levels.

At 36 I'd have to say your a bit on the low side Wis wise for a Cleric but
if you pick your groups wisely you'll have until 49 to get it up to 170/180
and then you'll be Ok.  Until I got Greater Healing at 51 I avoided playing
the healer role in groups but only because my heal was for only 260/300
HP's.  Good luck and good hunting.
