Which you illustrated with the allegedly outrageous prices for
Leather Padding.

You need to define "screwed up economies".  The economy of every
standard rules server I've played on has been very similar.  The
economies of Test and Firiona Vie vary somewhat from this "norm".
In the case of Test the variance is almost entirely due to its
very small population, selection of goods for sale is narrower
and much more variable and prices are quite variable also.  For
FV the difference is due to almost nothing being NODROP (there is
often a better supply of items of a given power for a given slot)
and very little twinking going on compared to other servers (there
is a much smaller market for many goods), so prices for many items
are a lot lower than on standard servers while the lack of a twink
market limits the market for tradeskill ingredients.

The demand for tradeskill ingredients on FV is much much lower than
on standard rules servers, see above.

You really ought to define "screwed up".  I've explained above the
(fairly obvious) market forces that make prices different on FV than
they are on other servers.

Standard rules servers have much healthier economies than FV, IMO.
The no-NODROP thing makes a mockery of quite a few instances of
item balance and risk/reward planning in the game.  FV is the only
server where I've seen multiple instances of a non-level restricted
12/23 1h-blunt go begging for buyers at 300pp.  That, to me, is far
more "broken" than 20pp (or 30pp) per for Leather Padding.

Well, my name's not "dude".  But that aside I'm more than willing
comply with that request.
