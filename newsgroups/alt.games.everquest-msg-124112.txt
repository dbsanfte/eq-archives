I'll give it a shot, if I can get through the Warrens.  I followed the
instructions to get to the Warrens this weekend ( thanks to the folks
that provided directions ) and got there without a problem....but once
in, gezzzzz, could not believe the number of Kobolds.  Everytime I'd
stop for a sec to look at a map or explore a bit, I'd have a train of
them on me.  Luckily I had bound in the pool room just outside the
zone, had SOW and Gate ready to go. Five times I wandered deep into
the Warrens, close to the thrown room and into the prince chamber, and
everytime, I was getting ponded so hard I could not cast, had to run
back for a few minutes to get some space between them and me then cast
gate to get away.  Would hate to get killed deep in there and have to
get a corpse out.  The warrens is a tuff place to solo at lvl 15, but
would like to get to stonebrunt to check it out....and of course,
there's getting back.....perhaps I should wait til I get a port spell
:-)
