	What gauls me here is that I can't do the quests.  The story of the game,
such as it is, is told through its quests.  Locking high-level PCs out of the
quests is a near-mortal wound to anyone who enjoys exploring or roleplaying.

	BTW, there is a quest in Stonebrunt that should be damned near impossible
for anyone to complete, at least not without cheating.  It requires
Crystallized Shadow stuff from ToFS, and drops from "spiritlings",
multi-colored and very low-level Wisps in Stonebrunt.  If you're low enough to
get the spiritling drops, you ain't gonna last thirty seconds in ToFS.  The CS
stuff is not NoDrop, AFAIK, but if you can afford to buy it you probably
aren't low enough level for the spiritlings, either....

	I wouldn't give a rat's ass for anything that drops in the Warrens in
terms of loot, and so far the only interesting item I've seen come out of
Stonebrunt is Footpads of the Tiger, which is at least equal to and maybe
better than Monk PLANAR boots.  And they're on a mob my guild's Monks would be
TCC'd out of.

	They MUST, because that's all that ever happens.
