One of the biggest things that starts to get old for me on a server is 
when I begin to get gear that far exceeds what I could legitimately 
obtain on my own through hunting/camping. Unfortunately, it's a *very* 
easy trap for me to fall into, especially once it becomes the norm as it 
has for most servers.

I usually start by telling myself that I'm just going to farm enough to 
get a couple of decent weight-reducing bags and halfway decent weapons. 
While farming, I justify over-farming by telling myself that I should get 
more than I think I'll need just in case I have trouble finding decent 
deals on the gear I'm needing. Add to that the fact that I am able to 
gain xp through much of the farming in EC, and I end up spending several 
levels doing little else.

Then there is Bazaar syndrome. That's what I call the scenario wherein I 
perform a search on the type of item for which I'm in the market, and end 
up deciding that nothing I can actually afford is suitable, therefore, I 
need to farm some more. Keep in mind that all I'm looking to replace here 
is likely a fine steel longsword or the like.

Of course, while I'm out there farming, I decide that I don't want to 
experience Bazaar syndrome again, so I end up over-farming still more. 
You can see the vicious cycle this tends to become for me. 

Anyway, I've decided (again) to roll up a new character on the newest 
non-transfer server (Stromm) in hopes of a) avoiding the strong desire to 
twink even a little, and b) giving myself the best chance possible of 
playing with others who might tend to be a bit less twinked on average 
than other older servers. I've tried it on other servers, and it sucks 
being the only one you can find taking a purist approach to character 
development and equipping.

I went with a warrior, due specifically to their heavy reliance on gear. 
My thought is that as a warrior, I will come to value each little upgrade 
I may be able to come by that much more and hopefully recapture a bit of 
the magic, so to speak. :P

So, there I went, a brand-spankin' new wood elf warrior, charging out to 
smite some sylvan bats and decaying skeletons with my trusty training 
sword and little else but my wits....and got my Rallos Zek lovin' butt 
handed to me repeatedly by white cons. O_o

Seriously, I was level 4 before I could even compete with a white con'ing 
mob. Blue mobs were only netting me 3% of a level's xp at best, and a 
mere 2 or 3 of those normally spelled the end of me. I guess I'm just 
spoiled, but it seems to me that I remember those first 5 or 6 levels 
anyway just flying by with no deaths. Naturally, that was with at least a 
full complement of moderate twink gear. ;)

It seems I've got a long road ahead of me, but I'm hoping to keep some 
perspective this time around and make an effort to smell the roses along 
the way. :)
