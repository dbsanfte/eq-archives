If it makes you feel better, I couldn't solo squat in the 50's and spent
many an hour "/lfg on" in Sebilis.

When I finally got a fungi tunic (about level 57 or so) I could solo a blue
drolvarg in Dreadlands, albeit with downtime while waiting for mend; most
karnors/velk/seb mobs would eat me alive though :(

Now though I can kill certain spiders in Velk, and not even lose 1 bubble of
hp... guess it evens out :)
