  Maybe it got carried away by pests.  Have you had your place fumigated
for house gnomes lately?

   Of course I care!  We all care.  C'mon, everyone, group hug for Biz!
   Besides, if I had some sort of weirdo tech problem and asked for
help, and you had a clue for me, I'm reasonably sure  you  would pass it
on to me.  And you would probably be curious to know if it worked.  So
keep  us all posted, it's an interesting problem you have.
