It's not all that common knowledge.  There's a fat lot of us who simply 
don't care what other guilds have done.

Of course, that may change if my guild gets much closer to 'uber'. :)

Although I guess on my server I know this much:  Eternal Wrath has done 
everything, Sphere of Transcendance and whatever Vallis Scortor are 
calling themselves these days are huge so they must have done some stuff, 
and Fury of the Fold just absorbed Deathrow which used to be Tides of 
Valor, so they probably get the 'jackasses per square inch' title.  
Although I've met some of them that were all right actually.  Maybe it's 
just Zilor.  Oh, there's some other guild called Exiled Alliance.  I think 
they might be uber, but I'm not sure.

Damn, I gotta stop reading the server message boards.  I really didn't 
want to know all that. :)
