There was a report in the newspaper here, not long ago, of a person who had
started a company that actually plays their characters while they are at
work. It mentioned UO specifically, and also said 'other role playing online
games". It seemed clear to me they were talking about EQ, because they
mentioned levelling.

I think that some people play the game to make money, if they enjoy
themselves as well, that's just a bonus. Some people go out to a golf course
or tennis court just for a bit of exercise and social intercourse, others go
out there to make money. Some just play the game, some play the game to make
a living from it. The point in my first post here was, that it doesn't seem
all that "mind-boggling" to me.
