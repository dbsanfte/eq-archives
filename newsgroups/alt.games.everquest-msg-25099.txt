If a grif is hitting you, you are doing it wrong. Fear animal, snare,
DoT, nuke nuke, whack whack dead. Half mana, full health, and looking
for another. If you have caster crack of some form, try 2 or 3 at a
time, snare all, AE hail, run circles around them. If they don't move
too far, you get full damage out of the AE. Very mana efficient, but
hard to finish them off without crack. Med up, rinse and repeat.
