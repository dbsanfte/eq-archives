Nope, AB. But if you read other followups to this thread, you'll
find that this sentiment isn't unique to me by a long shot. And
it shouldn't be, it's the group's time I'm taking away, so if I
get some cash, I should share it.

Well, isn't it rude of you to ask for the rez, then? You just asked
for their time, and if they ask for compensation, they're the rude
ones? See what I have a problem with understanding here?

You're spending their mana to save your time, why be surprised if
they ask for payment? You have to understand where I'm coming from
here, I hope?
