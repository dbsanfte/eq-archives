christmas day....my neighbor comes over and asks for help with her
computer. She bought "The Sims" game for her daughter and they didnt
have a CD-Rom drive in their computer so they bought one and had
trouble installing it. Turns out she needed to remove the jumper from
the back of the CD drive. Then I find out they are on windows 95, 2mb
onboard video, 20mb of ram and a whopping 164mb hard drive. they only
had 5mb of disk space left and i had to splain to her that they
couldnt install sims cause it needed 300mb of disk space. Shes a
single mom with a kid and they are on a tight budget so just telling
them to upgrade is like telling her daughter she cant play with her
xmas present. I posted this thread as sarcasm to the people wanting to
sue verant (which they indeed are nuts......this country needs
loser-pays-court-costs-of-opponent kind of tort reform) but it seems
that for what a lot of people need in a computer, the older models
work quite well. Im sure this wasnt even a pentium....probably a 486.
They paid only 125 for the whole system. Imagine how far weve come in
10 years. It used to be 10mb of disk space for our games and now its
1.5 gigs. EQ is truly fantastic now and we bitch about waiting 10
minutes for a patch.



p.s. since i build all my computers and have several spares (due to a
bad MB here, a bad power supply there...good reasons to upgrade in my
mind hehe) I was
able to set them up with one of my old systems a P2 450mgz 128mb
ram.....much better than a Packard Bell 486.  >^..^<
