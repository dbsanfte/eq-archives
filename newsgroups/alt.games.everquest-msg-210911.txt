Yeeek - I thought my Erudite SK was a little on the weedy side but DE

Since when did the Salvatore novels introduce an antihero rip off of Elric
- Elric was unusual but in all too mny ways he was very much
Melnibonean....Drizzt Do'Urden was a pretty standard fantasy RPG motif of
'everyone knows this is the bad guy, but actually he isnt he is the
complete opposite'. Elric could be REALLY bad bad if he wanted, Arioch
not being the nicest of chappies, he was an anti hero, DD is a pretty
standard rise above the rest straight hero concept. At least they didnt
let DE's take ranger...

Amen to that :)

Damn I was hoping my use of "other" would go unnoticed, had seemed to uptil
then.
Yes that is how it read but that was poor proof reading by me, sorry.

Should really say;

"not to mention every anti hero rip off of Moorcock's Elric" or "not to
mention Moorcock's Elric and every other rip-off of him"

From what I've read Drizzt was based on a character from another TSR novel
(Darkwalker on Moonshae) called Darryth or something. The author of that
book, Douglas Niles, hadn't elaborated much on the character so Salvatore
used him as the inspiration for Drizzt. If you are fan of Salvatore's
character and haven't read Darkwalker on Moonshae then I suggest you don't,
it's not worth the time, it's a poor rehash of the Dragonlance novels (evil
coming to destroy the world) which of course is just a ripoff of LoTR but at
least DL had some style to it (even if the franchise was flogged to death
and then some) and the only likeable character in it is a Hunting dog.
I carried on reading Salvatore long after I realised I had outgrown the TSR
D&D novels, basically because he can write action like no one else I've
read, especially the so called action/adventure authors like David Morrell
and Eric V. Lustbader.
I haven't read anything by him since Starless Night (I think) but I see on
his website he is still writing the Drow novels.

Anyway, my Dark Elf was inspired far more by Elric than he was by Drizzt.
