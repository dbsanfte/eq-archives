The Bob asks:

EQ says its my WIN based modem, I have tryed all the different settings
except the advanced options with a string setting. I cant seem to find a
init string setting for this BCM modem. So, if any one can help me out I
would greatly appreciate it, as I miss playing EQ immensely.

>> Although I havent been in the technical sales for past 2 years I remeber
the WIN based modems as causing quite a bit of problems before the EQ days.
Most people would tend to stay away from WIN modems.  Might look at
replacing the modem...

hehe better yet, if you can afford the mony, go get a cable usb modem and
subscribe to cable service or some other broadband. Bleah v.90 56k....
