SCM, hands down.

The description for SCM is entirely misleading and gives you no idea what
the spell actually does.  SCM3 gives you a 10 percent mana savings on *all*
spells.  That's on top of whatever focus items you happen to have.

SCF gives you a chance on criticals even if you don't get criticals
normally.  As a cleric I *could* get SCF but I won't, since nuking is
something I seldom do.  SCF will be useful to you as a mage, of course.
Just not as useful as SCM.

Just my two cents.
