Hm. If that is so, it wouldn't be "evolution" in the classic sense. That 
would require that cataclysmically stupid people don't get to reproduce. 
That is in fact not the case, and in addition, smarter people tend to 
have fewer children later in life, if they have any at all.

If humanity is in fact evolving, it would be at the memetic level, not at 
the biological level.
