(I didn't get to go pickup my Surefall ports last night, as I went on
my first trip to Fear instead. I pulled a wonderful train of half a
dozen monkeys and other critters out of the path to our first camp
when my invis dropped/I got aggroed.
I just wish I'd gotten a picture of them all turning to charge me
after wiping the floor with someone else :) )
