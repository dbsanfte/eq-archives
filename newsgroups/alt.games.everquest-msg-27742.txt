Man ... most of you ppl have some major issues to deal with in your
life ... first off .. unplug from you 'puter once and a while and live
a real life.  Most importanty ... never forget:

              "THE MEEK SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH"
 
This is true ... and if you would unplug from you puter long enough ..
you would notice that the vast majority of all the
"high-school-too-cool-football-jocks" you went to school with, are
still there.  Either in school still or "hangin" out trying to pick up
"chicks" half their age or ... they just work as a "custodial
engineer" or a "Nourishment Distributor".

Think about it kids ...

If a kid gets bullied around ... is it cause enough to shoot everyone
... wait a minitue ... they did it cuz they were bullied right ... so,
if they have the guns now ... they have the "power"... Now who is the
real bully?

If you can't handle high school and the stoopid ppl there ... your
done for anyways ... move to a polar region and hide under a reallllly
cold rock!

Later.........
