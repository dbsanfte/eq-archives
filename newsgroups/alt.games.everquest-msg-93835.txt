Same problem with the lava rocks. Tiru is still needing a bunch, even
after finding a wizard who sold her a stack and a half. They drop once
in a blue moon in lavastorm and Najena. Then, there seems to be noplace
else to get them until you can hunt in Skyfire. Our last trip there
still only produced two in a long grind. I don't think the drop rate has
been improved at all.
