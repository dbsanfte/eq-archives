As others have already noted, your puller was an idiot. Don't give up on
it yet, but don't group with that guy. We spent many fun and profitable
levels in RM and I was generally the puller. I can think of maybe once
or twice where we had unmanageable adds and had to bail.

It's a *huge* zone. The puller just needs to find a giant, pop it, and
then head back, but needs to WATCH where they are GOING. The nice thing
about a zone that size is that you can always "take the long way home".
Two more giants in the way on the hill? No problem, bail down into the
channel and pull them there. Two in the channel? Go the other way. It's
an outdoor zone, so as long as the SoW capable people keep the puller
Sow'd, he/she can outrun those slow giants all the live long day. And
for that matter, there's not reason for your party member to die, even
on an overpull. If you keep everyone sow'd, when you see you have too
many to fight, then you have a hot button for everyone to "RUN TO ZONE".
Might want to tie in a /shout TRAIN warning as well. You can run to Free
Rot easily from the Giant area.

Give it a chance. Great zone at your level and the money is still good.
