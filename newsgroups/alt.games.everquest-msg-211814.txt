Read the orginal post again, you seem to have gotten confused with your own
drifting of the thread.

It is a 34 ranger comparing what a ranger can do from 0-34 relative to a SK
or Paladin. "totally irrelevant to any knowledgeable player" is kind of a
stupid statement to make since we are talking about a relatively new player.

Taking damage<tanking>, damage<weapons>, special abilities were mentioned.

There is nothing absurd in my post. The reason why rangers are worse at
being a tank is because the other classes have better available equipment to
them at lower prices.

In another post I pointed out that using a ranger's special abilities means
they are typically broke too since they are fear kiting animals.

He is right, zero to ~34<I would probably put it at ~5-29 myself since under
5 doesn't make a diff and after level 30 things are better> is tough for a
ranger. It is a difficult class to run well during those levels.
