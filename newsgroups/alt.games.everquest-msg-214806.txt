Beastlords, hands down. Maybe it's just my luck, but I rarely see the
same number of high level beastlords as I do other classes, and all
the ones I've grouped with have been huge attributes to the group.

Sad, too, because the Beastlord is a fantastic class to play. The
buffs, the pets, they're very fun for the people who want to play a
Shaman but still get into the thick of things.
