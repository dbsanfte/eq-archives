Try to be coherent...

"If your [sic] too high to kill the mob"?  Let's face it, a
level 60 is hardly "too high" to kill a Kobold in the Warrens.
Perhaps you meant "too high to get exp from killing a mob".

Furthermore, it's not true that high-level players "dont [sic]
get any loot", my level 52 Paladin was getting various kinds
of decent loot in the Warrens just two days ago.
