Must admit that LDoN, as fun as it is, got out the worse in me when 
joining groups. Im a druid, so usually only get guild groups anyway 
(someone need to explain to the last 95% of the EQ population how druids 
work) but when i get pickup groups, im only taking them now if i know at 
LEAST 2 person in the group, or i know the guild the groupmembers are in 
and know them to be good players and/or well equipped players. Getting 
tired of pallys that fully buffed got less HP than me (can happen, 
believe it or not, i get around 5500 hp fully buffed, been with a 65 
pally that had 5100 fully buffed), and people who are just playing so 
bad that they should never be allowed in a group again.

Can single 2 examples out:
Made a group of full level 65s, with a 4700 hp pally as MT (who actually 
adapted VERY fast and did an impressive job), and with a 65 cleric with 
best AA title and epic. That should mean the cleric know how to play, 
right? But no, the first 30 min me and the necro was wondering how she 
managed to run oom 3 times in 30 min with KEI on, untill we found out 
that she used Elexir to heal instead of Cheal, with her argument after 
we complained being that it was the same mana and just as good spells, 
and sticking to that even after i went to a cleric site to look up her 
spell and seeing that it only healed for 2K total. Her reason for it: I 
get aggro all the time if i use Cheal.
Then i tried to explain to her that when a 65 druid can do first snare 
on a mob, and then our Cheal because shes oom, she should bloody well be 
able to do it too. Then she tried, and get aggro from around 33% of the 
mobs. Reason, cause she sit around 0.2 sec after casting a spell.
Whole group was talking in guild chat (3 of us in same guild) and in 
tells to each other about her, and was shocked how a 65 cleric could 
play like that. Everyone ended up putting her on ignore after we failed 
the adventure, so we dont accidentially group with her again.
And just to make it even more fun, one of my guild clerics was in guild 
with her and got kicked for being british (go figure), and could inform 
us that her clerir was PLed from 1-65, all officers made clerics like 
that to fill in the lack of clerics on raids.


And then i had the pleasure of grouping with a chanter who just LOVED 
the nice pets in Everfrost and insisted on having them, and then 
managing to wipe group twice due to the pets being in the way of her 
mezzing, so she couldnt target (hard with a pet taking up half a 
dungeon, stupid rotten elephant mobs). Most impresive thing about that 
group was that we actually made it, was a kill kill mission luckily.


Luckily i got a few people with less life than me in guild that wanna 
take me down in the dungeons, so i dont risk grouping with random 
morons. AND it will make the problem with having to leave for raids a 
lot smaller (having laid raids off since LDoN release so the last people 
could get their VT keys finished, and try out LDoN.
