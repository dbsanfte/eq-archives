Worst begger i have met was actually TWO different gnomes in Steamfont, within 1
hour.
Start begging for 10pp for money for spells. I give my standard answer, that i
need money for my own spells.
Then he beg for some equipment, and i tell him i dont have any.
Then he say im lying, because he saw i was auctioning a 75pp Large Fine Plate
bracer before, and i can just hand it over (why a gnome want a large FP bracer i
still dont get).

After the initial shock of seing a begger DEMAND the stuff i auction for sale I
tell him to get lost. He bitch a little and leave.

20 min after another gnome show up and ask for the same. Then i ported out,
there is a limit to how much begging i can stand.

Havent been to Steamfont since.
