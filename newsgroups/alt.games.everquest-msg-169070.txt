Actually i'd have to say you could do quite well in PoG.  Let me clarify,
half of PoG.  The West side is full of wanderers that are around 52ish and
drop armor 'rarely', but do drop spells, gems, etc. occasionally as well.
Your group could handle those just fine.  The problem with the west side is
that its on an 8 hour timer (i think, maybe more maybe less).  So you may go
there and it will be empty.  Also anyone can enter, but you have to be able
to gate/tp/port out.

Another problem with Plane of Growth is that many people do go there in
small groups to farm blue diamonds etc.

There is the faction issue, as other people have said, but remember Evil
will always triumph, because Good is dumb.

If you do decide to do PoG, zone in invis and run west, that wall is
relatively safe (one treant wanders by very rarely).  Then head north and
eastish to find mobs....Have fun.
