	Those HG's don't drop anything but coins and non-magical junk anyway, and
it's a lousy place for EP if you ask me.

	Oh, bollocks.  3 days ago I walked into Runnyeye on my way from Everfrost
to Nektulos (I walk most of the time).  All the nameds were up and I was the
only one in the whole freaking place.  Where were all the poor suffering
lowbies?

	They were in Lake of Ill Manners (sic) levelling up.

	The simple truth is that no one goes after this stuff because it is not
worth the trouble for anyone who can get EP for doing it.  Going after Lord
Pickclaw while he's blue would require as much effort as a Kael raid requires
for my guild, and the loot just isn't worth the trip.

	And yes, I killed all the nameds.  Nyah.
