Raiding is pretty challenging. I think the hardest part has to be 
controlling the bored raid members. Some are morons. Are there walk-thrus 
that people can use on places they aren't an expert on? I've been on several 
Chardok raids, Grumm raids and various others in PoF, PoH... Just curious 
what the big leaguers use.

brews on Tallon Zek, Torvonillous, CT, ...)
