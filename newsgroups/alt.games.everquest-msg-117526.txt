I see.  We're using different definitions of 'hold' here.  By hold, I
mean expect them to follow the agreement, not leveraging them to
follow it.

Well, one could imply it by the way you smacked down the original
poster.  Or is it infer?

Yeah, I agree with you on that.  I do think that Adam was pretty much
correct about his assessment of the act though and was pretty much in
the right to complain about it.  Maybe the hit that IC's reputation
takes over this will be enough to discourage them from behaving like
this in the future.  I doubt it, but there you go.
