Well you are right about the top end, but Ancient spells do still drop.
Ancients drop off Lord Seru, Vulak in ToV, and off nameds in VT.  Ancient
spells are no drop and many are useless.  I suppose if you were really
interested you could go to Lucy and look up the ancients and see if there
are upgrades with PoP spells.

Of the two Necromancer Ancients one is useless and one is marginally useful.
Master of Death is a lich spell that has a specter illusion, which means it
can't be used with a horse, it takes 63 hp and returns 44 mana per tick.
Comparatively, Seduction of Saryrn, level 64, has a skeleton illusion, so a
horse can be used, and takes 63 hp and returns 50 mana per tick.  Lifebane
is a poison based DD doing 1050 damage for 340 mana, a 3.09 ratio.  The PoP
upgrade to this spell is Neurotoxin (level 61), which is a poison based DD
doing 1300 damage for 465 mana, a 2.8 ratio.  Both have a casting time of 6
and a recast time of 4.  Lifebane is a better ratio spell, but I rarely find
myself in a position where I am nuking and need to be more mana efficient.
I don't have Lifebane, but if I did, I doubt I would use it much, if ever.

The only Ancient that I ever hear anyone really hoping for is the Wizard
spell Greater Concussion, which decreases hate by 600 as opposed to the 400
from Concussion.
