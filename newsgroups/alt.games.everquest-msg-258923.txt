The finest box-art by far was for the Psygnosis Amiga games.
Really sturdy boxes too !

Shadow of the Beast 1, 2, 3
Leander
Menace,
Obliterator
etc, etc. 

I have a pristine collection of most of these classics, 
including sealed packs of T-shirts that came with the
SoB series and some of the others.

(and an Amiga ot two to run them on.......)

However, recently I did go through and destroyed at 
least 100 (non-descript-art) boxes to get my game-collection
down to a reasonable storage-space. Large transparent
plastic sandwich-bags in stackable Tupperware totes are
fine storage containers for un-boxed games/manuals..
