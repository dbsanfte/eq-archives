Snip thanks I will try that idea. It seems I had fallen for the it's a 
higher level it must be better syndrome.

Hehe! I finally broke the 3000pp in the bank last week. Everything I 
have is from Quests or drops. Except my Centi Short Sword and Ivy-Etched 
Tunic (Both presents from characters doing their epics wanting a 
tracker, In the case of the Ivy Etched. As a 14th level ranger I was 
slaughtered after the NPC they had spawned (After handing a book in from 
memory) decided I was more fun to play soccer with than 11 high level 
characters all a lot closer to her than me. (Must be my size again 
<grin>)

I finally got my baking and brewing high enough to make Giant Steaks and 
Qeynos Afternoon Tea (Hehe! a must for some one from England <grin> )

Hehe! I died 3 times getting my rune off the NPC in Mistemoore. The 
silliest was while the party was resting. A NPC spawned in the middle of 
the group. and with all the others there including an Ogre warrior it 
decided  I was the appetizer it wanted. I died before another group 
member said in /Gsay "Oh! What happened when did you die" ???

Humm! I must stop being polite and ask for more. To English I suppose.

Hehe Doing that, at least under English law I could only be arrested 
"For behaviour likely to cause a breach of the peace". Rather than 
"Indecent exposure in a public place" (An English law oddity. To do with 
the gender of the offender <grin>)

Hehe! Goes to dictionary and tries to find out if DEBIL is an insult or 
complement <grin>
