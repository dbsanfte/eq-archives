Ah, thanks to person in other post for explaining what blogging was.

However, I can't think why you'd want to see one. I think for the most
part it would be very boring.

"10 am:  I was once again in EQ. Why on earth am I here again? I get
on and try to think of things to do, rather than getting on and trying
to think which thing I want to do THE MOST!"

"1 PM: I am still waiting for a pickup group for an LDON dungeon. I
started my own but we do not have the requisite classes, for my level
range, which are needed to succeed."

"3:30 PM: Well, I got the LDON pickup group. We did not have an
enchanter or enough support classes. The one cleric was always nearly
oom, since we had no mana regen classes. Once again, as the timer was
down to the last half hour everyone in the group freaks and starts to
rush it. We of course wiped again. This is getting rather old."
