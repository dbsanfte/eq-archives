I play all of the expansions on a lower spec system [Celeron 300A, 128
RAM, Voodoo3 card, Win 98SE on 56K], though with none of the new models
for PCs bar the cat people...and thats a RAM issue.

I find it has that. THe social aspect depends on what player guidl if any
you join, and how outgoing you are. Roleplaying itself is relatively rare
except on certain specific servers. THe theme is very much get out and do
the hunting thing...although there are a variety of interesting quests to
go do for anyone in addition should you want this. 

Part of the problem with quests is that as a server gets established, with
nothing getting destroyed, the high level kit eventually filters downwards
meaning that the rewards for quests may appear quite weak for the level at
which they are acheived.

Tradeskills are there for use rather than generation of cash though you
can use it that way moderately effectively once yo uhave sunk cash and
time into it.

THe traditionalist view is that you have to be on the level grind to enjoy
the game...camping this spawn and that, waiting for the next piece of kit
etc etc. This newsgroup is generally a bit more diverse than most, but I
for one dont sit on the level grind and camp for hours (a 2hr timeout
limits that for a start)...a lot of very high level limits get quoted down
as truisms for all levels of play...I am quite happy exploring seeing
whats in a zone, gaining levels slowly as I go to open up new areas and
see the sights. Exploring has to be careful and I've not been everywhere,
but I've been a lotta places and Ive seen a lotta monsters, done a few
quests and Im enjoying myself...yeah sure there are guildmates who joined
when my main character was lvl 25 and they were 15 and they are now at 30+
but what they do doesnt interest me.
