It's not normal.  While I just did skim over your message, no computer
should be making a constant loud noise, at least so loud that it bothers
you.  For reference, my sister actually just got a p4 1.6 as well (hp) and
it is quiet.

Probably the two most likely suspects.

1 - power supply fan
2 - cpu cooling fan

How I test these things is wait until the sound comes back and then jam a
pen or similar type object into the fan so it stops.  Once I pinpoint which
fan it is, I replace it.  *warning* that is how I do it, if you stick the
pen in too far and ruin the power supply or kill yourself, don't blame me :)
