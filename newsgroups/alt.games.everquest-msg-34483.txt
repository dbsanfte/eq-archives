Damn straight. The bard got himself in over his head, simple as that.
That's one of the disadvantages of kiting - you're by yourself, and
therefore have no one to back you up if you get into trouble. He
implicitly accepted that risk when he decided to kite.

Further, although the bard no doubt knew he was kiting the named mob,
it's nothing short of moronic for him to expect every else in the zone
to be keeping up to date on his every move. You've got your own fights
and group to worry about, and aren't responsible for knowing what some
kiter is up to over the horizon.

He was an idiot, plain and simple.
