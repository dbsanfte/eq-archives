Yes, it was almost too late. The GM said that one more day and he would
not have been able to do a restore. One day delay was my fault when I
misstyped the email address but 2 days delay were Verant's fault due to the
automated reply back asking me for information that I had already given them
in my original email. So then I called Verant and got a guy that seemed to know
his shit. He told me to get a hold of the Lead GM on my server, he told me that
the guides don't have the power to do anything about this kind of a problem.
So I finally got the Lead GMs email, once that happened the ball rolled and
I got my factions back.

I sent in a feedback email about the whole situation and the delays.
I hope someone in power reads it and improves their system some how.
