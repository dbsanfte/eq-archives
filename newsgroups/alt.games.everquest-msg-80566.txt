You can still somewhat "chain-pull" in the OT, and that will keep a chanter 
busy with mezzes and haste.

My new answer to level 30 hunting grounds is Dalnir.  Enough adds to keep a 
chanter busy, plus the stunning to keep the ( often pulled ) casters from 
nuking and healing.  Find 5 other good players who want to: 

a) have fun in a new place
b) get an 18% EXP bonus on top of the full group bonus
c) learn a new place - exploring is a GoodThing(tm)
d) make ok cash
e) get away from all the childish /shout and /ooc comments

I'd take 2 tanks, a chamois ( in case it rains ), your chanter, a cleric, 
and a monk ( easier to find than a rogue in the OT ).

I recommend levitating everyone for the run through Wars Woods.  I always 
took the direct route, which can kill anyone under 1.5k HPs if you don't 
have lev - at least on the reverse route.

We masterloot now.  Everyone gets the same cash, cleric gets the 'dots ( 
could try to make a case for your chanter, if you want ), and we keep a 
port class toon at the entrance of our current dungeon to do the selling of 
gems / fs weapons / other crap and the banking of the gold.
