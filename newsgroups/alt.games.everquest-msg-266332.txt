Kind of a funny exchange at the Fan Faire in New Orleans.

In the C.S. forum, one of the reps had just said that the selling of in-game
items was a bannable offense. I asked if he could compare and contrast that
statement with the fact that the Online Survey that SOE had set up in the
Fan Faire staging area included a question about whether a Sony run online
service that sold game items would be cause to a) continue to play, b) stop
playing, or c) have no effect on decision to play.  The answer started off
as "UGHHH, No comment." and another finished by saying "Customer Service is
dedicated to upholding an adhereing to any and all policies set forth by
SOE."

The "deer in the headlights" look was priceless though.  ;-)
