That and the fact that they allowed the programming community's insistence
on hitting the hardware directly slow down developement of new chipsets.
If they had been willing to break all the code that relied on hitting the 
hardware rather than going through the API, we might have seen AGA years
earlier, and several generations of chipsets.

Add to that the fact that the guys running Commodore at the time were 
crooks, and the Amiga was doomed.
