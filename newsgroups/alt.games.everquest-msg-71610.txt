Certainly, but does it have the gazillion or so possible misspellings?

The Dragonlance books, and in fact any of the books published by TSR,
are much better if you read them in your early teens.

I spend an inordinate amount of time on the IMDB, do I knew about that

I'm also looking forward to seeing Brad Dourif as Wormtongue. If his

role.
