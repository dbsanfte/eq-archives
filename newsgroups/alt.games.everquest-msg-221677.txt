Yes, I'm sorry I didn't explain that part. For each armor
part (actually, it's body part, I believe, not the armor
itself) that you want dyed, it takes one 'A Vial of Pris-
matic Dye.' Your head is red while the rest is white? One
vial. Your head is read, your leggings are blue? Two vials.
And be sure that's what you get 'A Vial of Prismatic Dye.'
I've seen some people selling 'Prismatic Dye' in the bazaar
but there's still another combine to be done before it can
be used.
