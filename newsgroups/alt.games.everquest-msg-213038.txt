But were you dead or zoned out when the mobs died?  Because if I follow the
rumor correctly, that was part of the formula for poofdom; mob dies to a
later wave of a rain with the caster of the rain not in the zone.
Presumably this is with a groupmate or PLer still in the zone and having
done some damage to the mob or something.

Sounds like a minor inconvenience, something that would happen rarely and on
the rare occaision it did, what the heck its only one mob.  But imagine a
high level raid situation, where sometimes in a close call/near disaster
half or more of your raid force may end up dead.  If rains are being used
heavily, then the odds of one of the waves of one of the dead caster's rains
getting the kill aren't all that bad... and if thats a dragon or god or some
rare epic mob that you just lost then the "it doesn't happen often" thing
isn't going to mollify you much.
