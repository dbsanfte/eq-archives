I don't know about 'fault' but you definately have an obligation. You 
can't go around 'roleplaying' in an environment where people don't 
realize it. When you do its called 'lying' or worse. Imagine you were at 
the mall "roleplaying" a shoplifter or an escaped mental patient and 
refused to come out of character...

Granted EQ is a "Roleplaying Game", (or at least that was 'the vision' 
once upon a time). But the bottom line is that most people aren't 
roleplaying, and won't realize you are. You owe them little, but you at 
least owe them the courtesy of letting them know that you, at least, 
*are* roleplaying.

Wandering around norrath pretending to be a vulnerable little elf waif 
wizard in constant need of 'big strong heros to hide' behind is fine. 
But you owe it the people you are with to make it clear that every 
aspect of that little elf waif wizard is a fabrication if there is any 
evidence they haven't figured it out.

Nobody says you have to switch to 'real life' mode either. But you are 
having a conversation with somebody, and they *did* switch to real life 
mode... (perhaps they were never even in roleplay mode). And its 
improper to interact with them as 'a character' knowing full well they 
aren't reacting to you in same.
