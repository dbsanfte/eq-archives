Heh, grouch. Actually, those lines they speak out are on some kind of random 
timer that comes up maybe once every third battle or so. I still enjoy 
hearing them when they do, and it's one of probably a pool of 3 or 4 that 
cycle, so you don't really hear the same line but every 1 in 10 or so. 
Still, I hear your point and have had a similar reaction when I've 
encountered really obnoxious ones.
