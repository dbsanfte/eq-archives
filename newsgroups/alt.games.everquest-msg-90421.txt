The other day I hung zoning (don't remember where I was zoning to,
more importatant things quickly cropped up)  Also unable to kill
program, num lock stopped working, couldn't alt-tab out or bring up
alt-ctrl-delte, completely locked up PC.  Decided to give it a while
since I wasn't in a hurry and didn't want to end up being dead when I
came back on.  Went to get some food, came back like 5 minutes later
still hung, so I had to do a cold restart.  Couldn't boot back up.
Unable to detect bootable OS on partition.  Tried safe mode, etc
etc...finally had to boot into Windows 2000 to get it to repiar the
hard drive.
