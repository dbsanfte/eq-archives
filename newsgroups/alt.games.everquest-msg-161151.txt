Good combo. My roomates a shammy and I'm a warrior.
Works well together, espically now that he's got sow.
We're both Barbs so we spent a lot of time in everfrost
and blackburrow (great loot there but your a twink so
no need to worry about that I guess). Oasis is a good
spot for some nice exp too. Just watch out for the specters
and such.

Happy hunting
