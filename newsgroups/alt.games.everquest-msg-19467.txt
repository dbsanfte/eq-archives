When I first decided to make a Druid I figured I would do the same thing.
Anon and duck the ooc. 14 finally arrived and I was so happy to have sow I
forgot to turn on Anon. After the buzz wore off, I got my first tell. A guy
wanted me to come to the mouth of dungeon in Lavastorm.

I was doing poorly there, even though it was supposed to be a haven for
druids at 14. So I asked him to meet me at the opening of Najena (sic). He
said something like, "I don't have sow so it would waste my time to come all
the way there and get it." So I waited a few seconds and didn't respond
right away. Then he wrote, "Hehe I guess it would be just as much of a waste
for you. OMW." The realization was priceless.

So, long story short, (too late) I never use role-play or anon. Even after
getting tp's. I always explain my position to beggars and let it go. Even if
the explanation is as simple as <fighting busy>.  But my ignore list is
pretty big. Some people just suck, even when you treat them like adults.

Good Luck All
