For experience, go to Cazic Thule.

For serious cash but practically no experience, kill Hill Giants in the 
Rathe Mountains.  They drop up to 63pp in cash.

It seemed like I gained more experience in two hours killing stuff that 
conned blue to me in Cazic than I did in two days of killing HGs that 
conned red to me.  Fair enough, with the sheer amount of cash you earn from 
HGs.  If you got exp from the HGs, who would ever do anything from 30 to 
40+ but kill HGs?
