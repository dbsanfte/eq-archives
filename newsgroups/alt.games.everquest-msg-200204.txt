LOL, You wear armour forged from the elements themselves by the greatest
smiths in the lands. You carry Weapons prised from the dead fingers of Gods,
you have accomplished all there is to do in the land, the heavens and all

Sorry I no nothing about the encounter but your post did make me laugh...GL
for next time, anyway
