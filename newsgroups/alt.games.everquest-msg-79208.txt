When are you going to grow out of the need for running to zone?  Or gating?
The guards were put there as another venue for getting rid of mobs, just as
those other two "more mature" options were.  It's not our place to say
"they're going to have to learn to survive without them eventually, so let's
make them learn earler."  That's just sheer condesention.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
