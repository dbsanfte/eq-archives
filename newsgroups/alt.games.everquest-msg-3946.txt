The difference is, once an enchanter gets to level 16 and gets the Breeze
spell, they get to call some of the shots.  They can yell at people.  They
can instruct tanks NOT to go off saving the cleric...that it's the
ENCHANTER'S job to keep the healer alive (and vice-versa).  They can
instruct everyone that if they don't start using the FREAKING /ASSIST
command, you're gonna take your mana and go home. ;)

Bards at 20 probably get a little more say (breeze song) than before 20, but
I seriously doubt if they can get away with being as bossy as enchanters. :)
