}Ok.  I've been to -some- of those nations, and seen first hand what they're
}like.  You talk about history and likelyhood.  Extrapolation is nice, but it
}dosn't always tell how things really turned out.

No, this is true, but if you go insulting 1.3 Billion people, the odds are 
pretty much on my side, I'd say.  And it -sounds- like you're saying that 
wasn't what you meant.  So it -sounds- like, basically, we don't disagree 
(much). :)

}> However -you- got on your soapbox and proclaimed that "The people of
}> islamic nations are also brainwashed to believe that we will destroy
}> them", and follow it up two posts later with "They haven't been taught
}> western notions of reason and logic.  There is no socratic method in their
}> education.  Can you blame them for believing the only thing they can
}> hear?"
}If you will look back, my statement is as a response to the suggestion that
}the Islamic people are all evil and idiotic.

Actualy, it was in response to a post about Kamikazes, but believe 
whatever makes ya feel good. :)

}My statement is an accurate
}description of the state-run media and education in many Islamic nations.
}Do you think you can run an article or advertisment sympathetic to America
}in an Iraqi newspaper?  This is the isolation of ideas that many Islamic
}governments maintains.

No, and I have no argument with your assertion that there is anti-American 
indoctrination.  Although that word 'many' strikes me as something that 
could get you in trouble.  

}> generalization of a humongous group of people?  Not to mention rather
}> bigoted?
}That's me, the big racist.  You got me pegged.  I wondered when someone was
}going to play that card.

No, actually, I don't think you're a racist.  If I thought that, I would 
have just killfiled you and been done with it.  I think you have made a 
statement that could be easily interpreted as bigoted.  (Hrm... need a 
word that means 'religiousist', but doesn't sound stupid...) I don't think 
you -meant- that statement to be quite so broad and sweeping, but being 
that it's a broad, sweeping statement that could offend a -huge- number of 
people, I thought ou might like the opportunity to clarify.

}> This is the entire reason I'm bothering to argue with you about it.  If
}> you wanted to make that "There are some people in certain Islamic
}> nations", I'd be inclined to agree.
}I thought that was understood.  Of course, since I was responding to an
}attack on -all- arabs, I guess I forgot to put that caveat in there.  Next
}time, I just won't try to defend them.

You mean, all the Arabs that flew planes in suicidal attacks on US Naval 
vessels during WWII? :)  Well, ah, you mean the intervening post here, 
between your two.  Ehh... I guess I can see how you can say that.  Still, 
responding to an unjustified attack with an unjustified attack seems a bit 
of a strange tactic.

But Ken clearly oughta be in my killfile.  Except, well, he seems to have 
run off somewhere... :)
