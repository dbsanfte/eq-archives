On Jewelcraft, it varied. I think I averaged about 80 to 100 per skill up,
though at least once I got 4 skillups within 10 combines (230-234). I
remember 230-240 going very fast, but the last run (240-243, to have 255
with my geerlok) was very very very slow. Though I have not done that much
since 243 (which took 419 combines at 242... argh!) and I'm at 245 now just
making a few dozen things for guildies.

1 in 3 it looks like from my reading. I personally wouldn't know, I failed
firing my artisan's seal (pottery, triv about 50 or so likely. My pottery is
195 and I have the geerlok) for my first attempt and havn't tried since.
