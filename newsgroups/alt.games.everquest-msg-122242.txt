1) Read this report.

Effects of Raising and Lowering Speed Limits, Report No. FHWA-RD-92-084

U.S. Department of Transportation
Federal Highway Administration
Research, Development, and Technology
Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center
6300 Georgetown Pike
McLean, Virginia 22101-2296

The simplistic summation is that people will drive at the speed they
consider appropriate for the conditions, irrespective of the speed limit.
Further, lowering the speed limit increases the number of accidents.


2) Amusing quote:

"In fact, two thirds of all accidents in which people are killed or injured
happen in areas with a 30mph speed limit."

Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, in the UK.

If faster is deader, then this should be impossible; the 2/3 number should
be on the faster vehicles, not the slower.



Now, no argument, if you're in an accident, faster causes more damage.
However, slower gives you more chance to be in an accident in the first
place.  There's lots of documents out there on both sides of the fence, and
most of them seem to have a dearth of hard numbers.

Two important things that show up are A) faster drivers pay more attention,
and thus get into fewer accidents; B) for any given area at any posted
speed, people signficantly under the posted speed get into more accidents
than people significantly over the posted speed.

I've been in 9(?) accidents in my driving history, with all except 2 being
at or under 30 MPH.  First one, I found oil dribbled down the road (very bad
when you're on a motorcycle).  Second one, I took a rock head-on (destroyed
the front wheel of my bike).
