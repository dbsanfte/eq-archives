Perhaps.  I guess I was psychologically averse to tailoring in general.  A
year or so ago I began working on the Coldain Shawl quest.  It was going
just fine until I needed to get my tailoring skill up.  That entailed much,
much farming, and I quickly grew weary and frustrated.  I even tried
creating a ranger alt for the sole purpose of farming pelts.  Finally, after
much pain, I simply gave up.

I forget which of the a.g.e regulars once comment about advice given to
someone who was starting up tailoring:  "While we're at it, why don't we
tell him just to hit himself over the head every fifteen minutes with a ball
peen hammer.  It will certainly be less painful and, quite likely, more
profitable."  That echoed my sentiment exactly.  =)  So when it came time to
get leather padding for my smithing, I never even gave a thought to making
my own and just bought stacks and stacks of other people's padding.

I've started to do the same thing with Celestial Essences, just to avoid the
tedium of making them myself.  Easy enough to justify now that I have oodles
of plat.  =)

I think I'm solely responsible for the recent price rise in Essences of
Sunlight on my server.  Used to be you could get them for 150 or 175pp each.
I bought all that were available in the bazaar and started advertising to
buy them for 200pp each, even going so far as sitting in Skyfire and
auctioning.  Every time I entered a new zone I would put up a "Buying
Essences of Sunlight, paying 200pp each".  This was pretty successful as I
got lots of "I think I have a few in the bank" responses.  Now, however, the
few times I see Essences of Sunlight for sale in the bazaar, they're going
for 225 or 250pp.  I've switched tactics, however, and started selling
Heraldic for stacks of Essences of Sunlight.  This, too, has been helpful.

Grr... conflicting testimony.  I actually wrote a guide on blacksmithing and
posted it on the EQtraders message board.  I originally talked about how you
could use a 15% item and EE bricks to go from 192 to 212.  I changed it to
193 to 212 after reading that guy's testimony.  Now reading yours, I'm
confuzzled.  I think I'll change it back to 192 because it makes more sense
to me and because I trust you, James, over a complete stranger.  =)

Human heraldic doesn't use sheets of metal... it's measured by the number of
Infused High Quality Rings you need to make a piece.

Never actually tried to figure out the exact cost... let's see...

Large Bricks of High Quality Ore from a vendor.... about 40pp each.  I can
usually get 20 of then enchanted for 100pp, so make if 45pp.

Celestial Temper requires a bunch of cheap stuff and a blue diamond to make.
I've been averaging about 800pp per blue diamond, so let's call the rest
trivial and just say it costs 800pp for one Celestial Temper.

Velium Rings require a large brick of velium and coldain temper.  Been
averaging about 25pp per brick of velium.  Throw in five plat for the
component costs of making coldain temper, and say it costs 30pp.

Add that all up... 900pp per Infused High Quality Ring.

I also need an Enchanted Chain Jointing, which needs another brick of
enchanted ore.  However, each brick produces two Chain Jointings, so call it
23pp.

Leather padding - 25pp.

Royal Temper - Rain Water and Griffenne Blood is cheap, relatively speaking.
I've got oodles of those in the bank.  It's the Essences of Sunlight that
are a pain, and it takes *two* of those to make one Royal Temper.  Call it
400pp per.

Now, the highly variable part... which deity is it for?  For my Deity,
Rodcet Nife, it takes an imbued opal.  Opals are 18pp each, and I can imbue
them myself.  For that order of a complete set of Fetid Heraldic Armor, I
had to pay 400pp each for 30 black sapphires, and paid 1K to have someone
imbue them for me.  Fierce Heraldic is a popular item; I can find shamans to
imbue the gems easily enough and they're about 20pp each from a vendor.
Let's go for Fierce Heraldic.  Call it 25pp per imbued jade.

Add that all up, add in a few more plat for various sundries and failures in
the sub-combines... call it 1500pp for a one-ring item, 2400pp for a
two-ring item, and 3300pp for a three-ring item like a breastplate or
greaves.  Imbued gem costs for deity-specific Heraldic armor might add
another 400 platinum to the costs.  So I might be kissing goodbye to 3700pp
worth of components if I fail a breastplate combine.

Clearly these costs would go down quite a bit if I farmed all the items
myself.  But I consider a few hundred plat to be worth the hours I'd have to
spend farming the components.

Also, a step in making celestial temper requires that I combine a blue
diamond and jar of acid in a pottery kiln to make blue diamond powder.  That
uses my pottery skill.  That's the point where failures are truly expensive.
I don't get many failures - it's trivial, after all - but I'd still like to
see the failure rate go down.

Whew, that was quite an effort in calculation.  Glad I did it, though... now
I know exactly how valuable maxing out my skill is.  =)

Ah, good to know.  Thanks for the advice.
