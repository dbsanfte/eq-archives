Well, that's going a bit far.  What she asked for was that we show
individual restraint.  That's not unreasonable.  This is, after all, a
ng about a game and we have to anticipate that a fair number of
younger people participate or at least read.

Waving censorship around is a red herring.  We're not talking about
the government stepping in and whacking you for using rude language.
It's just about a sense of decorum with the understanding and
information that younger people are present.

The use of specific words intended to shock fails to so do.  If
anything it allows many of us to simply score such writers as juvenile
and kill file them.  That's a pity because, with effective writing,
those could be the people with the most intriguing ideas about game
play.

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
