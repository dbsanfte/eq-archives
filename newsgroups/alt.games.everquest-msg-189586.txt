    Low level enchanters also don't have a lot of the tricks that a higher
level enchanter has to make charming safe  and efficient. It's a class that
really picks up steam as it levels.

    Psst - get some HP gear and focus items. My Erudite necromancer is
twinked to the gills, but never really gets below 60% health mostly because
of her HP gear and her Affliction Efficiency II item. If she had Mana
Preservation II, like off the amazingly easy to get PoK quest ring, she'd be
just flying. It's amazing how much difference focus items can make.
