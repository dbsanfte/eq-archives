only in terms of sales - it dont effect the gameplay... its just that
most people would rather be playing something that *looks* cool rather
than something that plays cool...

even when it was GTA1 and it was an overhead 2d style game, the gameplay
was cool and the graphics were a bit naff - obviously because you can
actually see further down the road you are driving in GTA3 this has
improved the gameplay, but that is only because an overhead perspective
is not suited to the driving parts of the game... it has nothing to do
with the actual quality of the graphics...
