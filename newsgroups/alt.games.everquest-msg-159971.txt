This is probably obvious to everyone else but not to me. I have loaded =
the EQ atlas skin which turns the less than useful help file in to a in =
game atlas very useful (available at EQATLAS.com )for those of you like =
me with no sense of direction. But my point is I also have a new player =
interface, each time I load one it replaces the other. The eqatlas =
specifically requests it is set up in her own folder with all the maps i =
want to use, I wondered if I put all my skins in one new folder if that =
would work.

Anyone any comments.
