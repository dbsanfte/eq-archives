Exactly, plus the pottery skill is one of the EASIEST to raise... and
CHEAP. you can master it in about half an hour on small bowls. The
easiest zone to do that in is thurg since the ingredients are all
right there near the wheel and kiln. If you want to get beyond the 103
the small bowls get you, go for large bowls to about 122 or so. 

My druid dropped the small bricks and pieces from Crystal caverns for
my dark elf who then made many of the unfired potions. All she has to
do is use one of the gate potions on her to gate to thurg.. then once
there and it is expended use the quest device and the small pieces and
fired part of the potion to make a new one. The unfired and fired
potions are NOT lore (though they are no drop)
