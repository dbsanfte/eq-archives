the next best weapon for you is the
Bone Bladed Claymore, 2hs, magical,
about 30 to 60 pp,
ask for it in East Commonlands,
the Bone Claymore origins in Befallen.

dont pay more than 60 for it, better is the 
2hs sword  from the gypsie in South Ro.
its 105 pp , and is magical,
works up to lvl 25.

The next best would be then a Tower Guards Blade or
a Ghoulbane, which is given to Pallys in Guilds.

You need a magical weapon from now on anyway.
Don't know if they fit your race, I'm human.

Pally Senamax, Karana, who was never frustrated,
'cause others hit with 50..
