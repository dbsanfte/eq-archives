ROTFLMAO!

Wow what a screw up. Of course anyone that did this is in for a big
surprise if Verant can go through the logs and nail them. If it was widespread
they might have to do a rollback.

All they have to do is make the necklace NOT work with any
of the enchant mana and metal spells. Somebody is kicking themselves
at Verant right now, probably along with several team members as
well. hehe
