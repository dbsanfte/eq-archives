Without the invis song you get at 19, the only practical route is through
Tenebrous Mountains...

PoK -> Shadeweavers Thicket (Shar Vahl book) -> Shar Vahl -> Hollowshade Moor
    -> Grimling Forest -> Tenebrous Mountains -> Katta Castellum

HM, GF, and TM all have mobs that run fast, see invis, and have large agro
radii. You should just put up Selo's and trust to luck that you won't get
jumped and eaten.

The trickier part is getting back. The tunnel from TM to GF is kind of
hard to spot, particularly if you're travelling at high speeds and have
several large, hungry, red-conning mobs on your tail. Having a good map
will somewhat alleviate this problem.


Once you hit 19 and have invis song, a much more sensible route would be

PoK -> Nexus -> Shadowhaven -> Echo Caverns -> Fungus Grove -> Twilight Sea
    -> Katta Castellum

Invis is absolutely essential through FG, and marginally convenient through
EC. The reverse trip is just as trivial. If lag is a sufficiently common
problem for you that you doubt you can keep invis up all the way thru FG,
you should probably reconsider your career choice :)


My advice would be to wait for 19 before you go. Bring enough cash to buy
all the Combine instruments while you're there. Song of Sustenance by
itself simply isn't worth the time or risk of a trip to Katta through
Tenebrous Mountains.
