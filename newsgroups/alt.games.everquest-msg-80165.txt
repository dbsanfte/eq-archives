Velium Spear - procs at level 25, effect Velium Shards
Cold based attack, and resists are checked on it.
Maximum damage from proc is 12... 

No, it isn't worth holding on to all the way to 25, for any reason
other than being magic.  There are a lot of other stickers out there
do better damage, and either have better proc's or better modifiers,
and aren't an arm and a leg to own.  Once you have the money for
something new (count on between 400 and 500pp for a fair low/mid level
spear) either vendor it (5pp avg) or give it to a new player, and make
their day.
