Hi , 
 I was reading the thread about whether or not guilds are overrated. I
have been considering joining a guild, I am a lvl 34 Druid on E' Marr.
I want one that is kind of laid back and friendly. Serious players,
but not really too serious. Anyway , how would I go about this? Ask in
game for guild leaders of various people I see around?
Thanks,
  Linda
