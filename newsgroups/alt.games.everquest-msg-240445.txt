As a rogue in HHK I used to work on my pickpocket on the guards near the 
zone into Highpass. Got up to around 145 skill in that and easily made 
plat pickpockets off of guards that would eat me for lunch at the level 
that I did it. One I pickpocked the Ancient Cyclops at 31... made 11 
plat in one swipe. Pickpocketting between groups is a good way to 
suppliment your income. I don't do it in groups because I didn't 
appreciate it before I made a rogue.
