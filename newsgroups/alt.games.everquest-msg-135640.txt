Sure you can, it's not hard.  If you know how to set static IPs (shame that
you went that way...it's a pain to maintain after a while) then you know how
to tell what YOUR IP is.  Chances are your router will have .1.1 at the end
of its address, but if that doesn't work just go to a dos prompt and type:

TRACERT 4.2.2.1

The first address will either be your computer or your router.  If it's your
computer, the next one is definitely your router.

Ok, say it's the default one of 192.168.1.1.

Simply open up your favorite browser and type 192.168.1.1 in the address
line and hit enter.  You should get the login screen.

Unless they've changed it (or you have), the default user name is blank, and
the PW is:   admin
