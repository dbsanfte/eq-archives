Is for necros to have an AOE mez.... I gots a single target, why not an 
AOE? I did crowd control all last week, and gosh it would have been 
easier with an AOE mez, instead of one that lasts just 18 seconds.

Have managed to keep 2 mezzed for a brief time, and learned that 
screaming terror is the BEST way to get the pet to back off any target.

I am a necro, and I want to do everything!!
