Oh hell, it doesn't even have to be ebay.  I know plenty of folks in their
50s who really suck at their class, and who I KNOW have been playing their
class for all those levels.

Just because they're higher than you doesn't mean they know jack squat.  If
someone 30 or 40 levels higher than you says something patronizing to you,
just respond, "LOL, you're an idiot" and /em chuckles as he walks away.
