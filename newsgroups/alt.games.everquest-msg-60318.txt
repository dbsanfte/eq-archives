I'm writing Casper R. Aquino to alert him he is being removed from
usenet.

Giggle.

As someone else says in the reply, he has it redirected to go to:
news.admin.net-abuse.email
But I've retyped in alt.games.everquest instead (yeah, because I have
no life either)
What a strange person to bother to cause trouble like this.

What ever happened to those happy bygone days of someone just coming
in the group and posting "you all suxxor and are fegs!" insead?

Am I right in assuming that newsgroups basically last forever? I mean
last time I checked I still have the ones for now defunct 80's
computer games like shadowcaster and some very old joke group of the
sweedish chef.bork.bork.bork etc.
