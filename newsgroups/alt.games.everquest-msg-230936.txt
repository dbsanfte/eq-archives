Did major fun upgrade to system last night, lots of good toys, and rounded
it off by getting LDoN through digital purchase.  Was just rounding up a few
odds and ends when got an invite from unknown character to join an LDoN
group - Hey, why not!  Great way to end the session.

Asked them to explain tactics, goals, how the thing worked before and
during, whilst sitting around healing and regening mana [did a lot of
that] - got nothing.  Basically no communication, no expanation on what, if
any, tactics we were using.

Heard lots about good drops and good ep in LDoN, drops were only so/so, ep
was about half the rate I was seeing in Paludal Caverns for the last week
[granted as I went from 17th to 26th ranger the rate had slowed, but still
way faster than we did].

Party was me, cleric, shammy and bezerker.  Into it, 'bout half to
collection goal, cleric goes link dead!

Later, no word of explanation from either of the other two, the bezerker
stands up from healing and sprints back towards enterance.  Then he's out of
zone.  Never saw him again.  About 5 skeletal remains from goal.

Followed shammy back to enterance, asking where bezerker was and just
generally trying to find out what the hell was going on?  Stop before zoning
out - nothing for five minutes, then shammy goes link dead and I am there
alone...

Will be back at it but am pissed and disappointed and had to let the world
know!

[Also cranky from lack of sleep - bet ya couldn't tell, huh?]
