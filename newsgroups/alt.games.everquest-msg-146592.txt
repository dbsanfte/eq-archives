I notice the slowdown when clicking the first item, subsequent items are faster. 
The first item often takes about 5 seconds to get to my inventory, during which 
time I usually click it a few times to ensure it registered the click. It doesn't 
seem like a freeze-up or lag though, just the game giving a delay for whatever 
reason.
