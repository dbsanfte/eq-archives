As you can see below, I play a warrior myself.   Overall, I've been fairly
happy with being a dwarf, although small size is our only real advantage.
And we have the very real disadvantage that we can't wear the cultural /
religious Rallos Zek armor.

For Ogre, yes.   They have the one uncounterable advantage that they do not
get stunned from the front.   No other race gets that.   It only really
comes into play when tanking raid mobs though...  so, if this is just going
to be your twink alt, you might not be concerned with that.

IMO, the penalties are not all that bad.   A 10 or even 20 percent
experience penalty won't really change your game experience all that much.
You still get to the same place eventually.   The early levels go by too
fast for it to matter to you... and the later levels are so long that a bit
more tacked on won't be much different either.   The faction penalties
started to mean less when Velious came out, and completely lost all meaning
from Luclin on.  The armor penalties for Iksar have likewise become
meaningless.  They can't use a few types of plate armor dating from Kunark
era, but nothing added in the last four expansions has excluded them.

For myself...  Personally, I can't stand the large races.    You can just
carry shrink potions to deal with it, but they get expensive and annoying to
use.   I can't stand the night blind races either, although this was a much
bigger problem back when I was first starting out.   Vision has improved
since then.

Having slam to interrupt spells is probably very nice at low levels, but
it's meaningless once you're over 55. (Kick gains the same stun ability
then). Regeneration would be nice if you soloed a lot.   But a warrior won't
likely be doing much of that anyways.   Even good / poor stats can be
overcome.  Gear grants so much these days that if you get decently equipped,
a gnome can have more HP than I did back when I was working my way up.

Play what you want is the best advice I can give you.    Each race has its
own advantages, if just small ones.   Ogre has the one huge advantage for
raids, but maybe Stalwart Endurance AA to max (anti stun) will counter even
that.

Just... whatever you do...  don't be an Assling.  For the most part that
particular combination seems to be played by insufferably annoying idiots.
