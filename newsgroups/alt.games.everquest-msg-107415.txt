On your Rogue?  I thought it just appeared in your hand when you dinged 
51.  /g, d, & r  Actually, I'm starting the rogue quest myself, I really 
want that mask.  Let guild senior bard loot the book this run, I'll get 
back up there and get it soon enough.  The quest isn't completely trivial, 
but considering that I'm trying to do it for an illusion mask, it's not 
that tough (or I'm just a glutton for punishment).
