You can gain a full bar of experience after you hit 60.  Until the point where
you would have hit 61, had it existed.

And yes, if you haven't gained any experience since hitting 60, you will
de-level to 59.  In 60, you lose just over an orange bubble of experience on
an unrezzed death, and about a quarter or half a blue if you get a rez.   The
level does fill up relatively fast though.  Much, much faster than 59, but not
quite as fast as AA levels.
