there's been a huge splash over sites like
http://games.slashdot.org/games/05/04/20/1438221.shtml?tid=209&tid=98n and
of course http://mobhunter.com/000058.html,
http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,67280,00.html

This is big stuff. I don't think they've thought this through. I can see way
too much potential for crime here. I mean, when i search on everquest i get
flooded with exploit sites and sites advertising hacking software. Not to
mention litigation: you nerfed my item which was worth $1000 and now i can't
give it away!
