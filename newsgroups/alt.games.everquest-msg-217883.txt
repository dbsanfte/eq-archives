The problem was HOW you said it. You implied that the reason I
couldn't afford to upgrade my system was because I didn't have a job.
That's just outright fucking snobbish arrogance, not to mention
disgracefully ignorant of the realities of life.

Also, your statement is akin to saying that all the homes in your city
should be "upgraded" to fancy homes because "why should those of us
who can afford them suffer because of those who can't?". It's an
attitude of pushing out the under-priviledged to pander to the comfort
of those who are better off. Feed the rich, sweep the poor under the
carpet. That attitude is disgusting.
