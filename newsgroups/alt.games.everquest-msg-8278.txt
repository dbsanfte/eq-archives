About what?  Graven Image or guilds in general?

If it's the former you should've asked before you joined, I know nothing about
them so I can't comment there.  But you should get to know them, group with
your new guildmates whenever possible and figure out whether these are the
people you want to associate with, and more importantly, outsiders associate
you with.
