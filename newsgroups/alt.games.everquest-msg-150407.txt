Yeah, but it makes us non-dual-wielding Paladins happy.

Speaking of which, they've *finally* gotten smart and are putting
some 1-handed PAL/SHD-only weapons in the game which put out damage
close to a good 2-hander.

This means that there's finally a good reason to use a shield.

Before, the choice was:

  1.  Use a good 2-hander and produce reasonable damage.

  2.  Use a 1-hander and a shield and suck mightily, since
      the 1-handers were designed with warriors/rogues in
      mind who were expected to be using a second 1-hander,
      thus 1-handers produced only half of the "damage target".

Now, thank Brell, there are actually Knights running around
sporting shields, which is the universal RP Knight image.
Verant finally snapped to the idea of making hard-hitting
1-handers feasible by restricting them to the classes which
can't dual wield anyway.

So now I'm having fun with my 17/22 one-hander, and
using Bash again for the first time in 40 levels.
