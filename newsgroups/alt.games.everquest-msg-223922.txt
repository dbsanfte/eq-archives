Most people moving to a different server won't need to move to a different
account, though, so it's only $150.

What's really ridiculous about that price is that you have a choice:

1. Move 3 to 8 chars to a different server and account with items: $375

--OR--

2. Move 3 to 8 chars to a different account on the same server, with items:
$125.  Move 3 to 8 chars to a different server on the same account, with
items: $150.  Same net effect as #1, for $275.

So, do it one step for $375, or make more work for both yourself and Sony
for $275.

Which other games have transfers?  The only other one I play is DAoC, and as
far as I know, there are no transfers there (other than the ability to have
one character cloned onto the test server).  They do support transferring an
account to a different person, and it is possible to get items in-game that
let you respecialize your characters, so it would be possible to simulate a
server move if you could find someone on the other server who wants to come
to your server, and swap accounts with that person.
