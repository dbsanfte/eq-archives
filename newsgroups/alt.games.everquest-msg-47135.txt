    Um, Bizbee, his main is a pre-Kunark druid. Given that he had to get his
51-60 spells as drops, and not from EC, when he got them I imagine he HAS
done Skyfire. One of the big complaints of people during the Kunark era was
that Skyfire was one of the places people felt "forced" to visit to level to
60 and get spells.

    Assuming he wasn't there to gack Talendor back when his guild did that,
he was likely there trying to get his post-54 spells, or soloing. Or passing
through to get to VP. Before they upped the drop rate off the other mobs in
Kunark, Skyfire really was the only place one could go and expect to see
spells drop.

    Re-read - he didn't call necros and mages "crappy". And he neglected to
point out the shamans and druids rotting crap, and the wizards kiting crap.
8)

    And the stats he pulled out are good, and show his point. That a
well-balanced party is much better off in a Kunark dungeon than in Skyfire.
The only thing he didn't address is how many well-balanced parties are out
there, and how many need to adjust where they hunt based on composition.
Juggs may be better XP for the downtime, and have near the same drop rate on
spells, but I ain't going down to Juggs without a high-level enchanter or
shaman.
