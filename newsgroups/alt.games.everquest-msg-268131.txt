Hello,

I am an ambitioned DAoc-Player and only thought "Well take a look at 
EQ2, maybe it`s fun". I wasn`t really expecting much consideruing the 
huge Hardware-Recommendations but I was completely wrong:
1) This game is amazing, great graphics, easy gameplay, nicesound. Only 
thing is the small inventory. I don`t carry anything and it keeps 
overflowing.
2) I have a Athlon 2800+, 1024Mb ram, Ti4200 (64Mb), and the balanced 
mode in 1024x768 is more fluently than DAoC will ever be. I actually 
think about altering my loyalties...

The nice bug of mixing german and english phrases is neglectable.
Whoever thinks about starting: GO ON! Best MMORPG I`ve ever played.

Ciao
Frank
