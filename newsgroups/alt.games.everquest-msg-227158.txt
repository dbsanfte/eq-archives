 >Anyone know what I'm talking about?  Anyone know of a fix?

I've had that happen before. I had my pause fixed for just
after the casting time of panic animal and it would work
fine sometimes. Other times, it wouldn't because lag would
make the casting time longer. As another poster recommended,
put a short /pause between your last doability and the attack
command.
