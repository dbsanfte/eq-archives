One of the major problems I have in this NG, "Doodism" aside, is that
posters seem to have no pride whatsoever in their ability to form a coherent
sentence (much less a correct one). (yeah, so I should just delete it from
my NG list and go on with my life, except that I would miss SO much if I
did) Apparently they think that, because they play such-and-such a class in
EQ, and are (OMG) level 60!! that they are 'gods' in everyday life as well.
Does anyone have any idea why that might be? (oh, and please give me an
answer, if -anyone- does!!!) Are we simply having to deal with 12 year olds
who can't spell, much less punctuate a sentence, posting to the group? What
IS the average or mean age of the group anyway? Does -anyone- know? Is it
just a personal gripe of mine, to see illiterate people posting, without
caring whether anyone can actually -read- and comprehend or make sense of
their posts?? I know I'm not alone in this, for I've seen posts on this same
subject -- much good that they did.

Ok, just a 'fix', something to make me not shudder or quake when I see
things such as "you're" (hint -- it means YOU ARE, and is a contraction),
exchanged for 'your' (which is the possessive form of the pronoun)... 'YOUR
doll... your troll... your book... your dinner...' )

OMG, I guess that this means that I have transformed (magically, of course!)
into my geology instructors.

Sorry for the rant, I just couldn't take it anymore. I'm really NOT this
anal...
