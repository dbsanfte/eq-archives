Ah, I'm not talking about particularly beefy articles.  The old PC Mag was
the type of thing I'm generally interested in.  I'm a PC Generalist and need
to keep up with Windows-based PC information, along with touching on stuff
like Linux, FreeBSD, etc...stuff that my bosses will probably ask me about.

Regarding a later post, thanks, I'll check out Maximum PC. :)
