Wow, interesting stuff! I had no idea it worked out like that (where 
training points aren't crucial). I haven't noticed my 1H Slash skill 
going up much on its own, but I guess that's because of the speed of 
leveling at this point.

Thanks for the info. Oh, and good tip on the bow thing, as a paladin it 
would have never even occurred to me to think about bows. It's cool that 
I can (and should?) use them in the later game.
