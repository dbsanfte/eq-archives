Yes, you will need to put a point into it to start it off. No, you will not
need to go back to Surefall. There is a ranger trainer in Kithicor, just
beyond West Commonlands. He is located in a three-building cluster along the
zones right-hand wall (if coming from Freeport), just out of sight if you're
actually on the wall. Check your tracking ... "rangerish" names will appear
on it. Follow them and you'll find it.

As many others will tell you, DO NOT GO THERE AT NIGHT. Between 8 pm and 8
am, it's a level 50 zone. I'd wait to about 10 am or so, then go. Start to
leave around 6 pm, just to be safe. Just be smart about things and you'll be
fine. I've done it many times, so it's not as bad as some say.

Hmmm ... I forget. Wait, no, I recall. I bought mine at around that level -
also based in Freeport at the time - in Rivervale, which is just off
Kithicor. The little fellows sell the spells you'll need until 22.

Seems like an awfully low rate. Make sure you're doing the cheapest possible
arrows for your level, but arrows that are not trivial to you. You should
get a point or so per stack of supplies (or set of stacks, to be accurate),
often more. I imagine the rate will increase as your skill gets past 30.
