Well, first, head to the EQCleric forum here:

http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/

Lots of useful information about being a "good" cleric.  Check the FAQ and
read some of the other posts for some good playing tips.

Just some general advice:

Pay attention.  Don't multi-task or watch television.  Be focused on your
party's health and be ready to heal them.  If you stay focused all the time
and actively respond to requests from your groupmates, you'll already be in
the top 20% of clerics serverswide.

Learn how to heal before you do anything else.  Once you feel comfortable
healing, learn how to do some basic crowd control like rooting off adds.
Don't focus too much on learning how to nuke and tank - those are bonus
skills, not primary skills.  You'll never get into an uber-guild by bragging
about your tanking abilities.  =)

That's it for general advice; if you have more specific questions, let me
know.
