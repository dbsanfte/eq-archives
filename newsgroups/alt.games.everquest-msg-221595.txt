I'm just glad I mostly group with friends, so, if I am the only one 
practicing the tradeskill in question, I get the items.  I don't sell 
them, heck, I don't even care if I make something from them, I just want 
more chances at raising my skill.  With my pottery skill, I often make 
just the unfired item, and then trash it, as most of the skillup crap 
doesn't sell worth a damn to players, and, often merchants won't buy it 
at all, or it costs more to fire the item than what the merchan will pay 
for it.
