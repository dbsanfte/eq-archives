> What is needed as far as programs to start?

Just buy the game, install and away you go.

>  I see that there are alot of
> different games?

Hmm you mean expansions? Just get the trilogy or a original, you
can always add more expansions if you like the game and want more.

> Can I play more than one character with one account?

Yes, you can play 8 characters per server. There are over 30 servers now
so that is a lot of character slots. You can only play one at a time however.

> Are there any other games like Everquest out there?

Yes several. Dark age of Camelot, Asheron's Call and Ultima Online
are the main ones.

>
> I used to play AD&D years ago and this looks similar.  Is it?

Yes very. 95% of everything in EQ is ripped off straight from AD&D.

> Thanks-looking forward to joining a game soon
