Heck, even when I was younger that 16 I'd rather be driven around by my
older buddies than ride a bike.  Bikes were what kids rode, and I damn sure
didn't want to be labeled as a kid anymore.

Nowadays, after having spent 25 years in a car instead of on a bike, a
century is a much, much bigger deal.  I know a lot of people who would have
to stop for a break in the middle of a five mile ride.

Age can be brutal.  That's another reason why I game.  You have to age ...
can't stop it.  You surely don't have to get old, though.
