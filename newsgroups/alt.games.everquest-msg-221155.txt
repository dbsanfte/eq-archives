Subject: Cleric ego issue and LDoN?

My husband has a lvl 39 Pally on Torv...  Tonight he was trying to get an LDoN
adventure and the group was set except for a Healer...  There were a total of 3
clerics online in the level range, so the group sent tells to them.  One was
already in a group, one was ready to log...  The last one sent a tell back
asking 'what percentage of split do I get?'  

The person in the group who was talking to this cleric told her she would
receive an even split just like everyone else.  She then informed him that
since there is a shortage of clerics, she demanded at least 20% above the basic
split or she was not interested.  

My question is this....  Is this cleric a sign of things to come, or is she
just full of herself and her class and if she keeps that attitude up, will
never be able to find a group?  I personally was floored.

In my LDoN groups, everyone gets an equal share except that any peridots that
drop go to the cleric.  

Input?
