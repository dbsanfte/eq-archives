Since I've had perm illusion I get fewer odd requests, however for a
year or so before that I was plagued with requests for teleports - it
seems that a bloke in a dress carrying a big stick is automatically a
wizard!  The fact that the stick was a Staff of the Silent Star which
shares the same graphic as the Wizzy staff was at the root of the
problem.

When I'd respond with why did you ask, the number of people who came
up with the excuse "I didn't know what an Illusionist / Coercer / etc
was" wa s quite incredible.  The most worrying aspect was when guild
mates would ask the same!
