I'm one of the Optastic Four of the IRC channel that SG has frequented
for at least a year now.  I've only kickbanned her maybe twice in all
that time, and only for five or ten minutes each.  Do you seriously
think that _you_ irritate me?

Anyway, no, unless a unique CD key is part of the deal.

Owner of 2501 Netstalker Points awarded by Corwin of Amber, mainly
because Atma's just too damn attractive to get away from.

Gave 7499 Netstalker Points to Cypher because there's no such thing as
a good day on AGFF without JT bashing!

Owner of David Watson, rec.arts.anime.misc
