Recall that the stated assumption was that 100 light blues gets you from 
18-19 in EQ1, and 100 oranges gets you from 18-19 in EQ2. So, if you can 
kill EQ2 oranges at the same rate you kill EQ1 light blues then your 
relative advancement would be the same. Yes?

That sounds consistent with what I've heard too. And is suggestive of 
the fact that EQ2 isn't really any less solo freindly, by design, than 
EQ1 "was".
