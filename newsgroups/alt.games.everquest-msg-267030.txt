A few hundred thousand fans with little or no alternatives; until now that
is. And just *why* would you say this is an *antiquated* principle? Seems
pretty much up to date to me.

This would be true if they had, perhaps, taken EQL and melded it with EQ2's
new features. But that would have had problems in and of itself. How many
hardcore "raiders" would keep their accounts with EQ2's raid *smallness*?
Not too many I would think.

How are they destroying it? Just because *you* are a bit peeved about it
doesn't mean the majority of EQL players are ready to quit over this.
Matter of fact I've seen many people from EQL state emphatically that they
*won't* play EQ2 and are staying with EQL for as long as the servers are
up. Will this change? Possibly but it can't be said that it's all SOE's
fault. Blizzard, NC Soft and the others might have a thing or two to say
about it before it's all done.

Some of those complaints are arising in EQ2 already. So?

Aha! But by complaining that EQ2 shouldn't have been introduced and all
money and time investments should have been made into EQL kind of
contradicts this statement. Face it, capitalism is about *choices*, not
simply about making money.
