I am comparing what is available to other classes to what is available for
rangers. An 18 damage 40 delay 2hs weapon that is available for paladins far
outshines something like a 5 damage 31 delay Jaggie Pine Crook. Likewise
Pine Scout Longsword is only 6 damage 27 delay.

No question, but processes at level 1 cure disease which is/was important
when hunting in Qeynos Hills for rabid wolves/bears or when everything in
the Karanas was rabid. Rangers hunt the same area w/o this advantage.

Bullshit back at you. You are comparing what is available to a level 30+ to
something that is available to a level 1. It can also be used by Paladins
and SK as opposed to some of the other decent drops that can't be used by
rangers.

I used the wrong abreviation. SSoM which is 6/22 and the crappy tag sticks.
