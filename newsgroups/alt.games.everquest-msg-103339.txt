  Are you sure about this?  If so, this does indeed explain it.  85 mana
still does seem a little high to me, but it's a lot better justified when 6
people get the effects of the spell instead of just one.

  Hm, I'm not convinced on this... why would +8 ATK through a strength buff
be any less effective in combat than +8 ATK from a pure AC buff?  It seems
to me that your bottom line ATK stat is what should matter.

  Maybe... in my experience, stat debuffs haven't earned a lot of respect
with most players, but maybe the way ATK is calculated for mobs is
different, and a straight ATK debuff is more potent than a strength debuff.

  Well, SKs already have pretty strong taunt spells if we need them...
Clinging Darkness is a very mana efficient, very effective taunt in my
experience, but any Darkness spell is good.  I have doubts that this ATK
buff is much stronger of a taunt than the Darkness line of spells.

  I don't think that it does, but I haven't tested it.  It's possible that
this is a group AC buff though... in which case the spell is quite nice.
