We had a similar issue with a level 49 Paladin in PoI.  He followed
us quite a way into the zone begging for an invite despite at least
two different people telling him politely we didn't need or want him

Had a roamer aggroed on him it's debatable whether or not he would
have made it to the zo alive but *STILL* he carried on.
