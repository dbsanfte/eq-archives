So your answer to my roundabout question in my last sentence is yes,
then?

No matter, I was more interested in this post of yours:

This is a perfectly valid reason, but it overlooks one other potential
development that I feel would be worse.

Someone mentioned how E-baying brings in outside economic factors into
EQ, but he was focused on how that would enable rich people to get
ahead of poor people by simply using their real life wealth to
manufacture ingame wealth and power for their characters.  I think
that misses the inverse of that.

Imagine instead if everything ingame had a price tag on it, a real
world, real dollar price tag.  For example, instead of thinking of a
fungi tunic as being either a great twink item, or a saleable worth
60k (on my server), it was thought of as six hundred dollars: six
hundred real life dollars.  You get a fungi, you can turn that fungi
into money that you can use to buy Xmas gifts, pay your mortgage, pay
off student or car loans, solicit prostitutes, whatever.

And worse, _everyone_ in the game views it the same way, or at least,
everyone with whom you'd be competing for drops.

Fact is, it would stop being a game at that point.  Also, try to
imagine being a guide in an environment like that.
