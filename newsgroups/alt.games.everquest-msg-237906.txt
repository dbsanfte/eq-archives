Good advice, L1, and I thank you for it.  I'm done with EQ, but it is advice
I should have taken.  In fact, there were quite a few stretches of time
where she was all but forgotten in my mind, particularly as I would play my
alts instead of the main character I met her with.  But she always crept
back into my mind after awhile.  I would log in my main, and it would remind
me of her, for ex.  Best thing for me was to quit.

As for her, she was logging in to relax and play, but she also wanted to
share her personal life.  Her escape was my capture.  She didn't want to
know about my life unless I volunteered things, but she volunteered
information with no concern as to whether or not I cared.  She assumed I
did, and she got me to care.  I didn't say, "You know, I really don't care
about your husband or your life, let's cyber and then play the game,"  but
maybe I should have.  It would have kept things nice and distant in my mind.
I am who I am, and when a person told me her problems, I couldn't ignore
them.  I tried not to get involved.  Not hard enough, I think.
