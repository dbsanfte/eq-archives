    In terms of progressing to other zones, your flag for Tactics isn't good
enough. You'll need to kill Behemoth in PoI at some point for that.

    You have the flag for VZ. Without the prior Behemoth flag, though, that
doesn't help you much.

    They do stay with you. You'll have loads of fun running back and forth
between the Seer and Maelin when it comes time to untangle those flags, but
they stay with you. So congrats! :-)
