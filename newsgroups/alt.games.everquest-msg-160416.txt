Slowlt but surely the family Drakar has been expanding, and taking on lives
of thier own on Vallon Zek. The youngest  Drakar child, Kyrdra is my wood
elf warrior. Due to role playing reasons, Kyrdra will never touch a
non-bladed weapon. I am aware that I am cutting myself off from a large
portion of the weapons that are available to a warrior by doing this. I am
wondering however if I have doomed her to a life of mediocrity as a main
tank. So far in any group that she's been in shes able to get and keep aggro
with no problems at all, however aggro-management at 28 is a far different
beast then aggro-management at 50+.  Due to a FINE allegiance Kyrdra has
been spoiled rotten as far as weapons go. 2 Lammies, 2 Centi LS's,
Wurmslayer, a Centi SS, and an Argent Defender ( what can I say.. shes likes
to collect blades :) ) What she has now should last her well into her 40's
but what about at later levels ? Will my role-playing decision to not skill
up Blunt, or Piercing skills be a crippling disability, or is there a large
enough pool of 1hs/2hs weapons to make her a viable MT later on in life.

Either way I am fine with the answer. I just want to know now what to expect
at later levels.
