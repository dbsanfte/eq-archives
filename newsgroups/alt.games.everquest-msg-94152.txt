Subject: velious armor graphics with luclin

Today, I bought a netted kelp tunic (again), hoping that by now verant would
have fixed the luclin graphics issue with velious armor.  My netted kelp still
looks like leather.  I went looking through the eqclient.ini file and found
this line <LoadVeliousArmorsWithLuclin=FALSE>.  Change that to true and check
out what happens.  I had a huge bronze axe that came straight out of my right
ankle. And I had another one stick to the side out of my right shoulder. 
Anyone know how to fix this issue?
