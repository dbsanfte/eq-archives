Honestly at this point I'm just going to go for the new ATI Radeon 64mg.
I've had enough with nvidia's crap. Their support for their cards blows.
I'm not even talking about Tech Support, but their website!

Also, if you check out the EverQuest supported cards page you'll
notice a lot more support towards ATI cards.

3dfx and Glide? BAH! Go to 3dfx.com! They just got bought
by nvidia!

Why EverQuest programmed a game heavily on Glide is besides me.
It isn't even an industry standard!
