Well, yeah.  That's why you were half right.  If the merchant's trade 
balance leaned towards player buying instead of player selling he'd 
still get a lot of trade but his prices would always be good.  There are 
vendors like that, tradeskill ingredient vendors that are off the path 
to the bank in some zones don't see much junk dumped on them, but they 
do a fair bit of trade selling to PCs.

I figured that's what you were driving at.
