Thank you for the tips!! :) I knew we would need magical weapons to hit the
Wisps, and Ive managed to get a bloodstained fang for my wife, and a
Vellious Hammer for me. IVe not been able to get magical boots yet though. I
think I simply havent had enough cash yet. As to the fire elementals, Im
thinking that Expulse Summoned might be good against them no ?

Also, how does one actually get to the Island ? Is there a shuttle that I
can take in Kaladim ? or do I need to get tot he boat that leaves from
Firiona Vei ?


Sorry for all the questions... Im still very much a rank newb to EQ Im
afriad.

Kyrann - Druid of the 14th Season.
