Keep the boats, but also put in the portals.  That way anyone that wants to
sit and wait at the docks, then sit and wait on the boat, and then sit and
wait when the boat zones, then sit and wait while it goes on to its
destination, still can.  More importantly, those of us who have done it a
time or two and no longer want to, don't have to.
