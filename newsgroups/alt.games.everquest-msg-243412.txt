You can't just stay away.  Suppose I want to get into a high-end raiding
guild.  They will have minimum requirements for equipment, level, AAs, and
things like that.

People who can buy the equipment with RL money, rather than spending days
in-game acquiring it like I would have to, can be spending that time getting
AA's, leveling, etc., and will have a significant advantage over me in
getting into that guild.

One of the points of role-playing games is to separate the characters from
real-life factors such as how much wealth the player has.  RL markets for
items destroy that.
