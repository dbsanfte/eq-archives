Tradeskills are a nice hobby to engage in when you are bored with exping,
collecting platinum, farming stuff, and running around enjoying the
spectacle of the EQ world.

You will not make significant money at them until you become highly skilled
at them.

They are a huge time and money sink, and the only real use for them is to
complete quests and make very powerful high level items, the materials for
which most people never even get to see.
