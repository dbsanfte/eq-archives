CPU = AMD Athlon 1ghz or higher (The Intel P4s are very nice, but AMD
offers the absolute best bang for the buck. Mhz to Mhz AMD Athlons are
faster than P4s in most benchmarks)

RAM = PC2100 DDR 512mb or higher (You can build a system cheaper based
on PC133 SDRAM, but DDR solutions are a great value now and offer
better performance.)

Motherboard = VIA KT266A chipset (SiS and ALI also make very good
Athlon DDR motherboards, but the KT266A is the performance leader at
the moment.) DON'T skimp on the motherboard. It is the heart and soul
of any system. You can have the fastest components available, but if
you put them into a crappy motherboard the system will be dog slow and
unstable.

Sound = Philips Acoustic Edge or Turtle Beach Santa Cruz (SBLive cards
have problems on some AMD systems. EQ hates SBLive! cards running
under Win2K/XP)

Video Card = Nvidia GeForce 3Ti200 or ATI Radeon 8500 (You can find
both cards on the net for under $150.00US. The ATI offers better image
quality, but it suffers from slow driver updates. The GF3 seems to run
EQ faster and more stable according to most reports post Luclin. Both
cards have 64mb of DDR memory which really is a "must" if you want to
run luclin models smoothly.)

Harddrive = ATA100/133 7200rpm 2mb Cache drives built by Maxtor offer
great performance. You can pick up a 30gb drive for less than $90.00US
at most online retailers.

Case = Enlight 7237/300 (This is my personal favorite for price and
performance. It is a mid-tower case with a 300w powersupply, and NO
sharp edges. Installation of complonents is very easy due to slide-out
motherboard and drive trays. For $50-60.00US it is a great little
case.)

My favorite online source is www.mwave.com . They have very good
prices, fast delivery, and are very quick to replace defective parts. 

Online hardware review sites:
www.anandtech.com
www.tomshardware.com
www.hardocp.com

My system (it is more than 6months old)
AMD Athlon 1.2ghz
512 PC133 SDRAM
Iwill KK266 Motherboard (Via KT133A chipset)
Philips Acoustic Edge Soundcard
Maxtor 7200rpm 2mb cache 30gb HDD
Enlight 7237/300 case (upgraded with 435w Antec powersupply)
ATI Radeon 8500 (250/250)
Toshiba 16x DVD
HP 8x CD-RW
Sony 3.5 Floppy
Linksys 10/100TX Network Card (connected to a cable modem)
WinXP Pro

I run EQ with all settings maxed. The only zones I have slow down
problems in are the Bazaar and Shar Vahl. These zones are problems for
all EQ players running luclin models due to high polygon counts.
