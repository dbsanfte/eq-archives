Armor route one:

Ornate Chain Tunic 136 to 138
Electrum Ornate Chain various pieces till 149 (mail)
Gold Ornate Chain various till 151, then Mail till it caps
estimated 155
Platinum Ornate Chain up from there to maybe 160
FS plate various to 188... really like to nail down the progression

Alternate Route
Platinum Ornate Chain in likely order of difficulty till I have
a full set for my bard, and then move straight to FS plate
no matter how far along I am... figuring the higher trivial
is offset by the attempts being much cheaper... and setting
up some lowbies to bring in padding wholesale

Bergh the cheap lazy smith
