Hm... I despise FoH and the idea of FoH as much the next guy, but I have 
to admit I laughed my ass off the first time I read about that incident. 
If it was well carried out and the target guild didn't realize what was

smacks of brilliance, if only for the "I'll be telling my grandchildren 
about this" factor.
