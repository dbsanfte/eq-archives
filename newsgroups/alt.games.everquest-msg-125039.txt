Thats a horrible amount of time to wait for somebody to kill a mob.  The
faster the mob dies, the faster he pops again, the faster another person
gets their epic.

With calendars and lists you can find Rage being up for 11 hours at a time
etc.. thats totally wrong IMO for a mob sooo heavily contested.

In a FCFS environment, Rage lasts ~10 minutes... and Im willing to bet as a
result, my server has seen more epicfied clerics since the change than your
server with lists has.

Anyway why should certain mobs be on a rotation?   Can I get exclusive
rights to The Drolvarg Captain in Karnors?  I mean in my low 50's I needed
that Jade mace as much as (if not more) that some 50's clerics now, who
"NEED" their epic.

Nobody said epics should be easy.. nobody said every single player will get
their epic.. if an FCFS'd rage means tough competition to be epicfied, so be
it.. its an exclusive club to be a epic cleric - maybe newer expansions will
reflect more what an epic quest should entail.

Smaller-medium guilds banding together, are almost certainly more likely to
have a force in Skyfire first.

When I see smaller guilds camp rage, I see THE WHOLE GUILD in Skyfire
exping, I see smaller guilds join up to get each of them an epic cleric.
These guilds can easily 'exp' and get spells in there and be happy.

Most large guilds (on Prexus) carry on with their normal raid life, making
it a priority to get into SF as soon as they are told its up... if they have
just pulled a mob though, or just wiped out they waste precious time getting
to SF.

The last guild to get Rage on prexus is a small guild who wiped on Wuoshi ~5
times or so, with a normal sized smaller guild dragon raid, 40ish people.

I had originally gone with my monk/cleric, and 3 guild wizards to manaburn
kill it, but decided to help the small guild kill it (they were largely low
50's/low resists people so were perma feared/stunned).

It was a while back so i don't remember specifics, but I may have been the
only thing close to a tank that they had left alive (also got kill shot)...
point being - these guys are a small guild.   They can't form as fast as one
of the top guilds, they need a lot more people to kill the same mobs.. they
still got Rage though.

The rage before that, I don't know much about the guild, but I think they
are a PoF/PoH level guild.. again very small in comparison, and they still
got Rage.

A personal friend of mine (leader of a tiny guild) got her epic, because I
took my guild there and FCFS'd it when he popped (she had been FCFS'd twice
the previous week, and spent every moment in SF)

Yes the camp blows ass... but to say the little guys have no chance, really
isn't true.
