Do you have the old account/password? If not I think you can get the
password emailed to the registered email address if you still use the same
email address (or have access to old one Hotmail, yahoo, etc)

Not sure about getting account that you've forgoten from Verant Help. ?

If so you can reactivate your old account and it should still have your old
character on it. And if you want to pay the 50$ you can get that character
transfered between accounts (without losing items on the same server)
