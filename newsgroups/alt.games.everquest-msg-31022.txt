I just got my gnomish necromancer to level 6. I'm very tired of Steam, 
and was looking for some ideas on where to hunt. I've never played an 
evil aligned character before, so having to be careful of dwarven and 
elven guards is rather confusing. Is there a particular zone I can go to 
that I might hunt in, without fear of a guard's footsteps, that isn't 
Steam or Ak? I don't really care about vendors (all I need is 
food/water/bank and I have my level 8 and 12 spells in the bank already
) and I have ports and binds available to me through my guild. I'd like 
to get out and see the "evil side" of the world. This necro is not my 
main character, just a darkside experiment, but I'd still like to get a 
view of as many aspects of the game as possible.

Thanks in advance.
