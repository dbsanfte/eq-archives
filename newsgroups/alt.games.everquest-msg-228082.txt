Heard about this in the a.g.e. chat tonight, went to check it out.  Works
like this.

You pay ~100pp to a "waitress" (merchant) for a token, which is no-drop.
(Token was 112 to me, with 66 charisma.  As far as I could tell that's the
only denomination right now.)  You then give the token to another NPC;
different NPC's give different types of prizes--some carry ones better
suited for casters, some for meleers, etc.  Hailing each will tell you which
is which.

At this point, I don't know what happens as I didn't have the 112pp for a
token. ;P  I presume they hand you something back at random, or you lose or
token.

Prizes can range from more tokens (I heard as many as 10 were returned) and
gnomish fireworks to no-drop stat food (+2 or +3 wis/int/str), droppable
illusion potions, and one nice item was a no-drop +35 fire resist stone that
goes in your range slot.  Nice raid item.

You can also win a "golden ticket" that you can use to "spin the big wheel
for big prizes" with another NPC.  No idea what he gives out.

That all I've got.  Maybe someone who was able to play will add more on or
make corrections.
