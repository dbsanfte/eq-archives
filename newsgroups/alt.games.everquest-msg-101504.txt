This is funny.
My son who has played for almost 3 years found 2 friends at his highschool
that have started.
1 of them convinced the other one to buy the game. That one decided to buy a
level 50 paladin to not have to level etc etc. The other guy couldn't afford
it but got some old gear off the level 50. So my son rolled a new toon and
they both are twinked in level 20 ish gear playing level 14 characters.

But the funny thing is the guy that bought the level 50 isn't having any fun
and can't get the hang of the game even though he has done the tutorial
several times..

My son only said well buying characters isn't very smart and what's the fun
in that.
