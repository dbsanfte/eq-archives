I took 3 NooB's under my wing and sett them for the next 20+ levels.  I was
going back to paineel to get my new spells and stoped by the bank.  I had 1
slot open in 7 trader satchel's.  I was thinking about guing up to the
bazaar and setting up shop for a couple of day's , then I remebered how
gratefull I was to get stuff as a lowB.  So i grab a bunch of stuff and
headed to the Noob playing ground and did a shout "jewlery ..  get your free
jewlery"  I had about 15 toon's come up 10 of witch wern't happy just
getting one piece when I was obviously giving out more.  I got 7 "that's it,
got anything else, can I have another"  (4 Golden Fire Wedding Ring -  +4
AC, +45 HP; 2 Sapphire Electrum Earring-  +4 STR, +2 Int;  1 Rose Platinum
Engagement Ring- +4 Int); 3 "Like  I can use this junk"..  Mind you they had
nothing in the slot I gave them an item for (1 Rose Platinum Engagement
Ring- +4 Int, 2  Gold Topaz Earring-  +3AC, +8SvD); 3 Grab and gone( more of
the same50 - 120 Jewl.Craft stuff) and 3 truly great people, and I hope up
and comming players.

First player.  LVL 2 ShadowKnight.  I gave a Silver Black Sapphire
Necklace( +25Hp, +25mana).  She was very greatful, said thankyou acouple of
times and ran off to Paineel.  I think she sold everything she had looted,
because she came back and tried to give me like 6g5s.  I handed it back with
about 100p added and said thanks but I was the one in the giving mood =).

The second one Lvl 5 Necro.  I gave him a Batskull Earring (+5 int, reagent
consevation 1)  HE said thanks and then gave me 4 stacks of bone chips.  I
turned around and Paid him The high value of them 100p

Third player.  Lvl 3 Cleric.  He got a Batskull Earring ( +4str, +4wis). He
thanks me and tells me not to go far, that he has some friends comming.  I
tell Him I will save a couple of nice Items for them and He letss out a
laugh.  About 10 minutes later 3 High lvl Char's 50+ one 63 Druid. show up
and start buffing the shit out of me.  I tell them all thanks and they send
me an invite.  I accept and see the name of the LVL3 cleric on the list..
Now I know why he was laughing.  They go to work on buffing him and doing a
couple of group buff's.  One of them had MGB and did a zone wide for
everyone to get around us and trough some regen and ac Hp Str buff's on.
When I do an inspect on him I see that he has justabout every slot filled.
No Helm.

Well I say to myself "self what should we do now"  I decided to do some more
shairing.  I ran back and got all the appropriate items I could find for
these three player's

The shadow Knight got some plate armor a good shield and a couple of wepons
and some more stat jewlery ( pulled out the good stuff HP Int mana Saves)

The necro got all my LVL1 focus items ( I had all but improved healling and
enhancement haste)  And Some other items He was exstatic his INT was up to
186.  Saw him day before yesterday (lvl 14) went and got all his lvl 16
spells and then took him to Kerra Island.  Broke the first 2 spawns for him
and told him good luck. With the zone xp modifire (20%) he should be 20
today

As for the Cleric with friends in high places.  I Trough him my now replaced
Batfang Headband (+2AC, +3wis, +3Int,  Extended Enhacement II).  It was
perfect it was the only focus he was missing ( Not a huge one, but still a
big one for a cleric).  HE said thanks and to put him On my friends list.
as He and his friends already had.

I felt good about giving the stuff away.  Sure  I could have mad a few K if
I had set up shop up stairs, but it wouldn't have been as rewarding.  And
speeking of rewards.  The guy that was playing the Cleric had  lvl 55 Barb
War.  I was up inm PC and got a tell from him asking where I was.  I told
him after I asked WTFRU.  And a few minutes later he shows up and hands me
the Hand of the Reaper (+5ac, +15int, -30CHA, +10 SvM, +20 MANA,  Secondary
Mellee Necro Only  with a sweet graphic)  We talked for a few minutes, and
He told me right after we got bone He went to Halas with this char and did
the same thing.

You make some of your best friends on EQ by being nice.  YOu keep them the
same way,  and they may even group with you if you know what you are doing.
The realy good freinds are the ones that will tell you that yo suck at the
char youare playing and that you should try a diferent class.  ( never been
told that one before ;-))
