Got mine back sort of.  I had to change the screen resolution 2 steps
higher.  But I can't go back to the resolution I like or it goes away again.
I tried moving the window to centerscreen and going back to normal
resolution but no joy.   So what I did was up resolution and change the chat
window font to max.  Looks clunky because at that size it comes out BOLD,
but at least it works.
