You're right about the geerlok not changing whether you can skill up,
but sometime after LDoN they patched all the sales prices on tradeskill
stuff so that nothing can be sold for more than the vendor cost of the
components.

As an aside, that patch basically broke Pottery, because of the two-step
combines.  You spend a bunch on components to make an unfired item, which
NPCs buy and sell for at most a few coppers.  Then combine that with 1-2
firing sheets and get an item that, due to the patch, sells for at most
the cost of the firing sheets (plus a few coppers).  So now anyone who
wants to master pottery is looking at making back almost nothing on their
successful combines, unless they're making something PCs will buy.
