Also keep in mind that all available data supports Hormesis (sp?) not
LNT{**} which is the basis of a lot of the outcry against nuclear (fission)
power.

IIRC, burning hydrogen only gets about 30% of the power back that needed
to be spent making it.  Without a serious, non-fossil fuel, source of
energy to generate it, defeating the storage and distribution hurdles will
be a waste of time and money.

Where we fell down (IMO) is the late '70's.  First, we dumped all that
money into the shuttle instead of developing an actual reuseable launch
vehicle.  Second, the end of the oil crisis and political pressure from
oil companies caused research into solar power satellites to be 
discontinued.

1400 W/m^2 - that's the solar power at earth's orbit.  A satellite 
array in Geosynch orbit gets the full amount 24 hours a day, 360
days a year (around equinoxes it loses about an hour a day - ish)

With orbital costs tied to the energy costs of getting a load into orbit,
rather than to fixed administrative costs(*), we could have been exporting
power and synthetic fuels for quite a few years now.

* The shuttle program employs 20,000 highly paid technical workers (there
are some who say that the main purpose of the Shuttle was to employ the 
huge standing army of technical people that was put together for the moon
race.  And that it succeeds admirably).  That's 2 billion a year before
we even launch one.  The last estimate I saw of cost to orbit in the
shuttle is $10,000 a pound.  I'm not even going into the near criminal 
travesty that was the X-33 (so called "X" - those guys wouldn't know an
X program if it bit 'em in the ass.)

** LNT = Linear No Threshold.  It's the notion that the smallest amount
of radiation is harmful over a long enough period.  Hormesis is the theory
that small amounts of radiation actually help.
