I have all the expansions. I bought the Gold Edition to start with and ended
up buying LoY because I desperately needed the maps. I have an awful RL
sense of direction. I get lost in my own town. Since I bought LoY, I'm much
happier.

I get bored too easily. I need to find other places to hunt. But then again,
the comfort of a familiar place is nice sometimes too. It was refreshing to
head back to Everfrost and Blackburrow for a bit after being away so long.
It must be my barbarian roots.

Thank you VERY much for all the info. This is the kind of stuff that you
don't find in the manuals and it can be hard to get somebody to explain in
game. I know that I had no clue about the different roles in a group like
you explained. All I knew was that somebody pulled and somebody healed. Once
in a while we had somebody rooting. I never even knew about any of the other
stuff! Thanks again for your help.
