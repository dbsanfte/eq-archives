Alt-Tab doesn't work in EQ. You'll need to hit Alt-ENTER, believe it or 
not. This will put you in windowed mode. (Warning, depending on your 
sysem, your screen may get a good bit darker.) Most people also find 
that their cursor is locked inside the window, so frustratingly you 
can't hit the minimize button. If that happens to you, hold down 
SHIFT-ALT-R and the cursor will release so you can minimize. When you 
are done, ALT-ENTER will get you back in full screen mode if you wish.

Well, to get every bell and whistle, yes. And having PoP will make 
travel incredibly faster. But in my opinion you miss out on a lot of the 
initial wonder of the game that comes from just traveling and sight 
seeing. Take a look around. It's a huge world.

Hang in there, it gets better.
