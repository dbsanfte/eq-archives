Yes -- but because the copyright holder doesn't choose
to protect their copyright, not because they have the right.
Certainly an owner can sell their old games.  But another
company can't buy them, recondition and repackage
them and compete with the copyright holder.

More to the point, you/I don't *own* plat.  We own
accounts.  You can't sell something you don't own.
And there's plenty of precedent that you can be deprived
of the right to re-sell access to something -- Sony's
servers in this case -- as well.   (Bans on sub-leases,
for instance.)
