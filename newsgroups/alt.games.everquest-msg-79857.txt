 There's no story changing going on, you're just not comprehending what
I was saying. That's what we had there (8). Based on that encounter is
why I said a warrior and cleric can probably take him. Apparently I
worded that wrong or something as you're now the second person to bring
it up. You never had an encounter and said 'Gee, we probably could have
handled that fight with three people instead of six"?  That's what I was
trying to express.

 You asked if I even played a Monk. I answered and gave examples proving
that yes, I do play a monk and do know what the quests involve. It has
nothing to do with making me a better monk than anyone else.

 You're going on the assumption that it will be an insanely long camp.
How about going to try it before just assuming it is going to suck? I
know people that have gotten it within a few hours of arriving. Of
course on the other side of the coin, I know poeple that have had
insanely long camps. My advice is go when you can get xp. Bring a group
with you. Have fun. Get some loots even. Everyone assumes they have to
go solo camp Raster when they are 60 and everything is green. The xp at
Elder area is great at level 44-45 or whatever it is.
