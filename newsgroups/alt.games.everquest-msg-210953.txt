From the shadows, the mysterious "Chris Monster"

Given what you said here, most likely you had a form of lag. You were
receiving packets but not sending. It kicked in sometime after you
pulled them. Then you pulled out of it, and reappeared to the mobs
(most likely the server just thought you kept running before then,
then finally got a correct position update when you resynced).
