But the fulfillment of this obligation to myself supports my obligations 
to society. How can I fulfill my obligations to society if I've chosen 
to fry my brain, and live my life as a tweaked out junkie or worse?

That's a pretty selfish perspective. Do you really beleive screwing up 
your brain only affects you? Do you live in a vacuum of human context?

If you choose a course of action likely to screw you up permanently not 
only do you become unfit and unable to fulfill your obligations to 
society you become a burden on society. To me it seems self-evident that 
deliberately choosing a course of action that will bring about these 
circumstances is morally wrong.
