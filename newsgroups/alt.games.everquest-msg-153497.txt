Clerics aren't really going to get hit that bad, IMO.  A
7500 heal is still far and away the best in game.  In
current equipment, it's still a *complete* heal for all
but clerics in the top guilds.

The mod rod change will change tactics some, but not as
much as it'd seem.  Instead of waiting, clerics will just
have to mod earlier and balance out their mana better.
Instead of setting them on the ground where wizards
"steal" them, they'll be directly summonable to the target.
It'll be different, but not in a massive way.

Monks soloing at the higher levels are about to have fun,
though, and "Team Manaburn" just went bye-bye.
