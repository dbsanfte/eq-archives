Was thinking of doing The Conspiracists: Arbogast and Miller quest in 
Katta for my cleric twink. (I don't know... sue me. I periodically get 
in a mood where I just want to go do some long arsed quest just for the 
heck of it if the reward is worth anything.) The details are here:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1495

We were talking about having my 61 wizard and my wife's 61 necro do the 
killing bits, parking the cleric in the right areas for looting any no 
drop stuff, etc.

First off, the loot. A couple of items that look like they might not be 
too bad for a mid twenties cleric to tote around.

Cloak of Truth

Weight: 13.0 Size: LARGE
Slot: BACK
AC: +15 Str: +10 Dex: +5 Cha: +5 Wis: +8

and

Shimmering Mace

Warrior

Slot 1: Type 4

Questions: Do you suppose it's worth it to get these two items? They 
don't seem to be level restricted. Will the early quest mobs you have to 
speak with even talk to a lower level character I wonder?

Are any of the mobs required going to give a problem to a couple of post 
sixty characters? They don't look that bad, except possibly the Ahkeva 
Ruins bits. Getting the two Akuel Xi Ans Vius is either going to require 
killing some Shadow Reavers, according to one account, or possibly going 
after Rygan Anisher.

I haven't spent much time ever in Akheva, except running through on 
raids quite a while ago. Don't know if that's feasible for a small group 
or not.

Anyway, it looks like a kind of fun quest for my twink and my main. But 
you hate to start on something like this only to find out it was for 
nothing.
