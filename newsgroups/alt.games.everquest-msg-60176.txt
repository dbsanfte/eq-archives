Only prob with all this is that over the course of the game(espicially
in the first few months)the in game year has been reset.It has had
it's year altered and reset alot of times.I think somewhere around the
second year some folks complained about this(again fuzzy memory but I
think it was end first year start second).At that point I think they
started making sure the in game years flowed forward.But it's likely
we'll never know when it started or what year it SHOULD be now. =)
