"IV. Find the guy responsible for the Wood Elf Illusion Crown Quest and 
beat the fuck out of him. There's nothing I enjoy more than taking a twink 
to Guk, doing a /who and seeing 18 lvl 65 players AEing the fuck out of the 
dead side while little fucking Timmy the lvl 42 paladin and his stalwart 
group of adventurers are left with dick in hand, crying their little eyes 
out."

Too funny.

children, it's blood... blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may 
be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.'
