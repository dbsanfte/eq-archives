Yeah, no shit on the officer thing...it's a pain in the ass sometimes.

On Zeb I normally hear 2-box referred to as "hydra or dualling."  Whenever I
can (except for raids) I dual my enchanter and wizard, since wizzies require
no brains but they come in handy for punting people.  I've dualed in Fear
and Hate but add guild leader responsibilities into that mix and I have to
make sure I have aspirin & Rolaids nearby to handle the stress (and I don't
even lead the raids!).  Once we learn the trick to breaking Fear without
wiping out I might just start dualling them again, but until then I try to
avoid it.
