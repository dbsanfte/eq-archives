You *do* make some very good points, and for a seasoned EQ player such as 
yourself, it isn't such an issue as far as I'm concerned. I just can't 
help but think that if *everyone* uber twinked, how many people would 
have any clue about their group responsibilities and tactics once they 
reach a level appropriate for their gear. Also, if everyone were twinked 
to that degree, why would anyone play a warrior?

So it's hard for me to see where it's not harmful for a minority of the 
players to practice this degree of twinking when it wouldn't hold up as a 
rule.
