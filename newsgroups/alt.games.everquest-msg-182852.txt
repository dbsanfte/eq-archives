It's true!  Somebody told me so last night, because I was 2boxing (I had to
correct them though, I was actually 4boxing at the time... would of been 5,
but the chanter was unavailable)

Lemme think where our members are from...

UK: 3
Holland: 6
Sweden: 3
Denmark: 3
HK: 3 (only 1 is particularly active)
Alaska: 10+
Rest is Canada, USA, places I don't know

Add to that the unemployed people, retired people, college guys and 2
boxers, and you have an Emp force :)

We did him with the graveyard shift once, 3odd groups when he popped
sometime after 2am EST (if we miss even 1 pop, we lose the luxury of VT all
to ourselves, hassle free) - so its not like all that big numbers are
needed.

I guess... the only Euro (Brit) guild I know has either just killed, or in
the process of killing Vindi, so they aren't exactly a raid focused guild
