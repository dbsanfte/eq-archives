hi, I had a character on sullon zek and was getting killed a lot when it 
got to level 8, so i took some of your advice and started a new 
(agnostic) character on fiona.

got to level 4 quickly thanks to help from some very kind strangers. now 
i have these 10 extra training points. how to spend them? it seems that 
any skill that has a non-zero value will get better if you use it 
(although fade seemed to always be hard so i am trying to do a lot 
of: frost bolt, fade, pierce). so i was wondering if i should spend these 
on jewelry, swiming, fishing, hand-to-hand etc. i have 10 trainings 
saved. what should i spend them on? is it too early to fool around with 
jewels? does a wiz have any use for pottery etc.?

apparently this is a roleplaying server. i read the doc and toggled 
/roleplay (it seems to toggle) but the doc says you're aloways in this 
mode? i seem to be anonymous if i do a /who no matter how /anon is 
toggled. apparently you can still kill npc's (that are not monsters - 
advice on this would be nice to know, but i am obviously not going to be 
doing it for a while).

so what does it mean to be in /roleplay mode. do we just /bow and /wave a 
lot or what?

there seems to be enought people around and they are friendly so i expect 
that it will be easy to find groups (but i have not been in one yet as i 
just played two sessions for s few hours each).

any pointers will be appreciated.

thanks
