~400-500, about half of whom are testbuff or near-testbuffs. On a
stable night about 150 will be raiding, up to 200 in certain
situations. ~30 traders in bazaar is currently about normal (note Test
used to max up about 80 back before the DX change). I'd lean more
towards the 400 than the 500.

It is a bit unusual that no one at all was in BB, that's where
testbuffies sometimes hang out hoping to get a testbuff ldon going,
unless they are all in PoK screwing around as they so often are.
