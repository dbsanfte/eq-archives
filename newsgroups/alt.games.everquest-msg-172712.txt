I believe the rumours of the nerfing of this quest are greatly
exaggerated.

I ran it at least half a dozen times since the last patch. Each time
earned (sub-51) about a blue bubble of experience (slightly over at 49,
slightly under at 50). At 51 exp earned dropped to about 1/3 blue.

Of course I'm trying to get levels by grouping as well - if I'm going
to do nothing but the shopping quest I might as well have EBayed my
character... I can imagine the day that having a character described
as "Thilcaned" will be an insult. :-) But at least you need to hit 35
first.

(I wonder what's happened that requires a ten-*HOUR* patch?)
