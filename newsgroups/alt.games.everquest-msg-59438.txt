My Wizard has a black cloak, raw silk armor on his neck, hands and legs, a
cloth cap, and a violet robe (I sold the robe the guild gave him and bought a
better quality one from a vendor at the guild). But only the robe shows up when
I view my character.

I realize that only certain pieces of gear actually show up on character's
bodies, but....where in Freeport can I get some cheap gear that a Wizard can
wear that WILL show up, particularly a cloak and head gear? I'm sick of looking
at him in just that violet robe.

And is there any place in Freeport that sells patterns for raw silk armor, or
the armor itself? I've searched just about every vendor in West and East
Freeport, and a few in North Freeport.
