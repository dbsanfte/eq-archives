Yep, sounds right. You dump 10 points into sta for 30 hit points at 
level 60. Not really worth it. Of course none of the stats really are.

If a cleric I'd dump 10 into wisdom instead, simply because the new
wisdom cap with AA points is 355 or something. Yeah, everyone says you
will easily make 255 but that is not the max anymore. You won't be
easily making 355 or anywhere near it, so every bit will help.
