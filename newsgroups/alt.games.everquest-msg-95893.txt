Yep - I like them and I am guessing I am not the only one either. I started
up a female half elf druid and have never received so many drive by buffings
and healings in 3 years as I have in the last 3 weeks....  I have this

sad about the EQ playerbase - but I am not the sort of person to look a gift
horse in the mouth.
