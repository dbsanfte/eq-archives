Read TwoHead's guide to shaman buffing further up in this thread -
especially the part about memming and casting buffs one at a time.
There are very few buffs you HAVE to have memorized all the time. The
only one I always have (outdoors) is sow, as I might not want to stop
to mem and recast it and usually get asked for it a lot anyway. I also
keep invis memorized if running invis - never know when the pesky
thing is going to drop. Other than that, I swap in buffs when they are
needed and use the slots for more vital spells - chloro or pack regen
sometimes stay memorized if I don't have anything better to do with
that spell slot.

You see, there are two ways to hotkey spells. You could make a social
hotkey with a little message and /cast 'x' - which I suspect you did -
or you can make hotkeys of the spellgems themselves. I used to have a
panel of gem hotkeys, sit and spellbook, I could see what spells were
memorized. After they introduced alt key casting, I don't need that
anymore.
Oh, and try to keep your heal spell and whatever else you might have
nearly permanently memmed in the same slots all the time :)
