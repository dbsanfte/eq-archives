Well, at first I thought, "How could they possibly have screwed up
spell research worse than it already was?!?!" Then I gave it a shot.
I've gotta tell ya', though the sub-combines might drive one a bit
mad, the drops required are *much* more accessible. With the help of
Allakhazam.com, I know where to go to get the hides and pretty much
just what mobs drop them. No more killing all mobs you can find of the
given level range in hopes that the research components they drop
happen to be the ones you need.

After working with it for a bit, I've gotta say I think it's a pretty
nice improvement over the old system. Everyone can now clean out their
banks of all those words/pages/practice components/etc.
