He has a point.
Using Sony's method of class balance the following is always held
true:
Class aint bitching - OVERPOWERED nerf em 
Class bitching slightly - Just right
Class sounds like a 2 bit whore that just got stiffed - Underpowered,
ignore at all costs
Class = Bards , dont dare touch that code! No one works here that
knows how it works any longer.. Delete from eq2 at all costs.

works for me....
