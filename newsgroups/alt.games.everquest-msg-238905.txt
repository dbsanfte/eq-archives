Hi All;

As with many people I'm sure, I'm stuck with the "what do I put AA points
into next" type question.

Play style;

I'm in a family style, non-raiding guild.  Most of my time I'm in pickup
groups doing LDoN's or BoT, HoH, etc. I farm for most of my tradeskill stuff
in the lower difficulty places where I can solo.  I like to melee (where and
when appropriate) using my summoned hammer and Yaulp VI. I have all
expansions.

My current 115 AA's with 6 more to spend;

Metab 3
Run 5
Healing Adept 1
Healing Gift 3
Mental Clarity 3
Spell Casting Mastery 3
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery 1
Celestial Regen 1
Divine Rez 1
Inate Enlightenment 4
Celestial Renewal 1
Div Arb 3
Radiant Cure 1
Exquisite Benediction 1

Since I don't raid I don't see the need (at the moment) for MGB

With having the 1st level of Radiant Cure, Healing Adept, Exquisite
benediction and Celestial Renewal I can't see the benefit of getting the
additional levels of these. Unless of coarse you feel there are more
importance in these than I can see.

I've read several forums and various discussions on AA's. One minute I think
I know what I want, then the next minute I read something else or someone
else's point of view and think that, that's better.

I have found over all, that the people in this NG seem more knowledgable and
having for more time in EQ than I do (1 year) have far better experiences
and wisdom to share.

So I appeal to the Clerics among you. Please share some of your thoughts and
reasonings for your suggestions.

Thanks much, in advance for your time and thoughts.
