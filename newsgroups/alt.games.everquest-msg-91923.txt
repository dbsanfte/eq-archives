Especially druids. The Elysian armor is to die for (and it's chain
instead of lederhosen!). Peach colored AC 26 plate helms or 12 ac, 15
<stat>, 6 all resist bracers aren't too bad, either.

(BTW, I was in ToV for the first time last night. While I was there,
we got a SS plate BP for our #2 warrior, and I got a SS bracer :) )
