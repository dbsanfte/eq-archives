Well, he was not up. There were no rangers in zone and all my guilds rangers
were tied up in Kael, but one of our top druids stopped by and saw Zordak,
and that pretty much means she had the range to see naggy, and he wasn't
there (Zordak up = Naggy down as I understand it).

Was another patch this morning to reset things again. I had always
understood Naggy to be up after a patch, but I'm getting the sense that he
might not be (though it's quite possible that someone had already gotten him
yesterday). Perhaps it's one of those ramdom 24hr spawn things. I know that
naggy's a week or so (plus or minus) on death. I wish they would nerf him
down at least a few days.... ;)
