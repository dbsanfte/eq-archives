The game is suppose to be challenging--otherwise it would get boring
real fast.

Some suggestions:

Get a druid in your group, have him bind in FM and port to Misty to
sell for the group.

Sell to the vendor in LOIO. Drop your copper and silver on the ground
when you get encumbered.

At your level, you could probably hunt in FV near the vendors and
bank.
