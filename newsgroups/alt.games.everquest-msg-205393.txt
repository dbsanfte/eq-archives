OK, I did all the parts of the shaman epic up to the Hole at least
once in order.  In addition, I did Ghiosk books two more times, the
student log stuff three more times, the woe/envy -with- gem handin
twice more, and then one last student log which told me my faction
was maxed out.

None of this really tells me how big any given hit was, since I don't
know anything about the size of each faction level or any of those
details I was asking about.

But since I'm there, I guess I don't care as much except in a
theoretical sense.
