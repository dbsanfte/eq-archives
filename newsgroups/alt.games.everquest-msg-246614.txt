My M.O. with pickup groups has been to put a group together for one of
the easy ones (Tak, MMC, MM) and, if the group turned out to work well
together, suggest Ruj or Guk for the second adventure. I have never
noticed a point differential in Guk when using the same group as a
Tak, MMC, or MM.

The way I've gotten a lot of people enthused about Guk has been to
point out the Type 7 FT 2 augment for the low, low price of 1150 Guk
points.
