   Heh.  We have no lots of things, last I checked.  Which has been a
while.  I simply cannot get on, and I don't have the disks to reload
the game (I am hoping that they are in a box we have in storage here
in Missouri).  Lenny thinks it's my modem.  With luck, I will be in my
new house by the 5th of next month (though in my limited experience
escrows tend to run long, and back with broadband shortly after that,
so I don't really feel like buying a new one.

   Anyways... you're right on at least one point, Dan.  With so few
members, running this guild is not exactly tough.  I am hoping though,
that when I get back on there will be enough of us to at least form a
group.  ATM, we have no active Rogues, Beastlords (though my real main
on test is a BL, the character that is the GL, and the one I plan on
playing in our groups is a Cleric), Enchanters, Shadowknights, Necros,
or Magicians.  I am not sure if we have any Druids, Rangers, Wizards,
or Monks that will be actively playing.

   To put it another way.. I only know of Me (Cleric), Bravefoot
(Paladin) and Lenny (Warrior).  And to be really truthful, until Lenny
and I get jobs and know our new scheduals, I don't even know that we
will be playing.

Just as well for right now, I think.  With the large influx of
/testbuff proddies that have come over, Test is in a bit of a turmoil
right now.  I'm hoping that by the time I can actually get in the game
again reliably, things will have settled down.  When that happens, I
will start a new recruitment thread here in AGE.


Anyways, the like to the ezboard again is
