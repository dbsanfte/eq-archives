Shhh, don't tell anyone, but the Wyverns in CS are also great for
tank-types to solo, if you can find one not being kited by a druid/wizard.
They're the only Velious mob I've found that my mid 50's Paladin 
can reasonably solo while blue without massive downtime or getting 
the snot beaten out of him.

(If anyone knows of any others, please let me know, the Wyverns are
starting to go light blue.)
