About 6 months ago, I had a necro alt tthat I needed to get into the same
guild as my other chars. Well, I had to run from qeynoss hills to lake
rathe. When I got to SK, This guy decides he needs to afk a while. I sit
around KFC for a while... and what spawns? Quillmaine *with* cloak. Now that
wait was definitly worth it!
Pity its my necro that scored the cloak. I get DMF floating anyway, and it
would have been nice for my cleric. Oh well, guess ill MQ it off to some
mage for their epic.
Anyone MQ'd this? How much do people pay for this? (Quillmaine feather
cloak)
