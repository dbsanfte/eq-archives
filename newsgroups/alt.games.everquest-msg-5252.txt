	That's what I have w/out the wheel tho (I assume by wheel, you
mean the wheel in the middle that lets you scroll up and down).  They
don't even make the Trackman I have anymore, tho the closest I've seen
to it was a cordless model that I hope to get someday.

	Unfortunately, I noticed that w/ the drivers on this mouse I'm
unable to highlight and copy anything in icq.
