CHanneling is only one point, do you even have channeling yet? No
point in putting a point in it until 9 when you can cast in any event.
Oh i think you are talking about when 9, one point is fine and more is
a waste the same goes with when you get meditate at 12. 

Don't spend the points unless you feel you need to for some specific
reason is what I find. Many of the spell things like alteration go up
of their own accord naturally, my sk has never added a single point to
them and they all max. The only things you need to add one point to
are new skills you get like channelling, hide, meditate, dodge, bash,
parry, riposite, etc.

Its better to have those extra points in case you some day get a great
weapon and want to start it off well or want to start a tradeskill and
take a shortcut to the max beginning of 21 points or whatever.
