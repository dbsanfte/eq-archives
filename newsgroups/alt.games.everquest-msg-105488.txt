No, you attacked like a vicious little rat in a corner, probably
because you realized you had screwed up your first post here and
needed to regain face. 

Yes, some people actually think this way. That blurb the other girl is
repeating ad nauseum labels you pretty well.

You set yourself up. Blame no one but yourself.

People who post "Why don't you play DAoC?" are asking an innocent
question too. See how well received that kind of post is.

Who cares? It is not relevant. I simply explain why your post can be
seen in a negative light. You don't have to think that way yourself.

And were set straight. You just won't admit it. Your ego doesn't let
you admit it. Especially now that your boasting was leaked to this
newsgroup too.

Of course. Someone thinking that EQ was hacked is most likely an
idiot, not a newbie, and despite your feeble spinning thats exactly
what you thought.

Why? We knew exactly what you meant. You're just trying to weasel out
of it.

"I can't get to EQ or its site, I think it was hacked!"
