ok, i've read all the stuff on this newsgroup about crafting, and according
to what i've learned i should be doing everything right, but i can not seem
to make even the easiest items!  i was trying to make essence of wild swing
(which is a level one combine), and the only thing i could not do is make
the main component pristine, so it had to be one level below that.  anyway,
i ended up with the apprentice 2 version, which is pretty much useless
because apprentice 2 is sold at venders...  so, what could i be doing wrong
here?  should a level 7 artisan really fail a level 1 recipe!?!
