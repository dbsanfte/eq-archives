    Not surprising to anyone familiar with necromancers. 8) Wait for the
higher levels, it gets even scarier.

    There should be a "general vendor" that sells spells like Root, Bind
Affinity, Invis, and the Shielding spells. Look around for that vendor -
should be there.

    If you have a steady supply of victims, you always keep it up. Health
goes down, mana goes up, so lifetap to hurt mob, life goes back up, mana
goes back down. I usually click mine off if I start to go too low on mana
and life combined to 'tap back up - as you level and the efficiency of your
lifetaps increases, it gets to the point where it never comes off.

    The latter. When you have this buff up, you have a lifetap proc with
whatever weapon you use. If you've ever had Boon of the Garou (that
enchanter werewolf thingy), you've seen a lifetap proc. By somewhere in the
level 16 to 20 range it was going off for me roughly once a fight, and
tapping back enough life that it was like a Lifetap with a 1:1 damage:mana
ratio. Is that worth it? Well, how often do you melee? And do you have a
fast weapon? Mine was 19 delay, so expect to proc less than once a fight.

    Yes. At later levels you get undead-specific Lulls, Roots, Fears, and
(most fun of all!) Charms. As a necromancer you are master of the dead, and
can do with them how you please. And since you're evil and all that....

    Kurn's would be fun for you. You could also pull undead junk outside in
the Field of Bone, so you'd have a lot of options. Just not a lot of
support - things like food and drink could become an issue without Iksar
friends.
