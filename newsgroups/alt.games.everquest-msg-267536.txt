My point is that "regardless of the odds" is no way to run a risk 
assessment.  The odds are very much the point.  If we try to live at 
zero risk, we risk not living.

She's "willing to take the chance" she says.  You're amazed that she's 
willing to take a .000016% chance but not a 1% chance... I'm pointing 
out that the reason is probably in the difference in the odds.

So google me up some cases of asthmatic or heart attack deaths 
attributed to
spicy food... I don't see any but I guess it -could- happen.  I'm 
willing to
multiply whatever number you come up with by ten, again, on the iceberg 
theory.

I'll wager, though, that the odds are going to be on the allergy level 
rather than the food poisoning level.  I've got (admittedly mild) 
bronchial asthma myself, and I'm in far more danger watching an Eddie 
Izzard concert than I am from spicy foods... in my case laughter is NOT 
the best medicine.

And if our thief is suffering from a heart condition so delicate he can 
die from the increased heart rate from eating something spicy, then he 
really shouldn't be stealing... an activity very likely to involve a 
racing heart as he risks getting caught.  Proving that the spicy 
actually caused the infarction, rather than the heart pounding as he 
realizes that he's given himself away would be... difficult.  Are you 
suggesting that we shouldn't try to catch thieves as it risks them 
getting excited and dying on us?

While this isn't a felony, I'll point out incedentally that all injuries 
or deaths occuring as a result of a felony in Florida are attributed to 
the felon; if a cop runs over an old lady while chasing the guy down, 
the guy is up on murder one (not manslaughter, as he deliberately 
comitted the crime).  I'm thinking if the guy dies as a result of theft, 
he ought to be on the hook for his own death; suicide is illegal in most 
states.
