If it's anything like enchanter research spells, then the items should drop
off mobs level 16 to 21.  Also, even with maxxed research skill, at level
21, the level 16 spell will not be trivial to make, and the items are a
royal pain in the butt to find.  After failing on 3 level 16 spells, I go
one set of the correct components, and found a high level enchanter to hit
combine for me.  Still had a chance at failure, but much less so than me.  I
can see why people get quite discouraged with spell research, and do what I
did, find someone to do the combine.
