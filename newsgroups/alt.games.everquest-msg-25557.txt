Strong case?
/em chuckles at Jacobson
How about, "they don't feel like letting you play anymore, cancel your account
at any time they wish and refund the remainder of your pre-paid subscription fee
on a prorated basis."?  That would be about the end of the story, I think.
  I would *love* to see a case like this dragged before a RL judge. Admittedly,
a lot of really silly nonsense makes it into the courts in these litigation
minded days where everybody has a lawyer and thinks they deserve to retire at
age 25 on the proceeds of a fat law suit against somebody's insurance company,
but even today I would think a judge would look at that, become slightly ill,
and throw you out of the courtroom with a stiff pronouncement that you look
seriously into getting some mental health care help and a job that takes up more
of your free time.
