     To my knowledge, this is has happened once, though I wasn't there at the
time.  A paladin named Medhai, or something close to it, stripped down (and
presumably was in /role, as are most people on FV) and shouted he was selling
KEI.   He got a full group, each of whom had donated, then sat down and camped. 
The fact that I know about it without having been there points to the kind of
reputation this guy has.

    I don't sell temp very often. I simply don't care to spend my time that way,
though I appreciate those that do.  But if I am in the PoK, not really busy, and
a bunch of folks are screaming for it, I will hit my "temp whore" hotkey.  It
goes something to the effect of "Now casting temp at the main back.  Please at
least cover the cost of the stone (11 plat). I'm on the green lizard."

    So, though I don't actually use the word "donation", I would guess that most
who see my spam would say that I have if they've just done a quick read of it,
as I would assume most do.  The norm on FV is 20p for temp.  I've had a few
people who do fork over the 11 plat I'm actually requesting, or one peridot.  I
do cast on them, and don't rebuke them in anyway.  But I do also think that they
don't really get it.  If they want to be able to purchase these buffs in the
future, doesn't it make sense to offer some small bribe to keep the buffers
coming back and doing this boring duty?  I've also had a few who have donated as
much as 50 plat, though not as often as the minimum donators.  

   When I pay for kei, and I do considerate to be a payment rather than a
donation, I give 20 plat, which again is the standard on FV.  Given that KEI
doesn't cost the enchanter a component, I think this is a fair return.  But from
my experience, I would guess that several of them do get one copper or a fishing
grub.
