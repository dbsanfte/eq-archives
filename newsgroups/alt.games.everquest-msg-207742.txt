Just did some of the quests today for my 15 erudite magician.  As soon as
you come up the stairs into the casters guild area, there's a fellow
standing straight ahead in front of the fountain who gives out the quest for
all casters.  Got the bracers which were AC1, Int1, Cha1.  Nothing great but
better than the dusty burlap I had on.  Got a couple other pieces, also + to
Int and Cha.  He also gives out a quest for a staff.  Have yet to complete
that but look forward to replacing my cheapo shiv lol.
