As has been said here many times though, the size of your mana pool only 
matters for encounters where you'll burn it all and have time to med to 
full beforehand. Aside from that, it really doesn't matter how large your 
mana pool is, within reason of course. If you have twice as large a mana 
pool as the next guy, you're still going to wind up sitting on your butt 
just as long. X mana spent takes Y time to med back.

By the time you get to the point where your mana pool needs to be as big as 
you can get it, you will likely be able to get the gear needed to make it 
that way.
