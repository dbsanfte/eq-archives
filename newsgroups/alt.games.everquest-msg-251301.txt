"This is the explanation I got - they didn't want an exact quote as the dev
who answered wasn't directly responsible for the change so I'll give you all

Mana regen on horses was an unintended side effect that was allowed to exist
with the understanding that the downsides of horses, e.g. not being able to

Again, don't shoot the messenger!"
