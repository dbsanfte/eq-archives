Funny you should mention that.....

I was out looking for some things for a new Warrior that I Was making, and I
saw someone selling a Lamentation for 250 plat.  That was at lese 1k Less
than anyone else on the bazaar wa soffering one for. Needless to say I
headed out for this trader. Needless to say I couldnt find this person. I
was able to triangulate to where he SHOULD have been, and once I had that
info, I Started randomly clicking in what appeared to be empty space.
Bingo!! Up pops a vendor window, with a shiny new Lamentaion as the first
item. I purchase it, and not 2 seconds after I had purchased it a Gnome
appears and starts swering at me. I gleefully ignored the little creep and
headed out to give a shiny new bauble to my swordbabe :)
