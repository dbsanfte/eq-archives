Why shouldn't a woman ever be the president?

Part of the job description for the President of the United States, is to be
the commander and chief of the armed forces, there is no woman on earth that
I know of who is qualified to do that, certainly not Hillary Rodham Clinton

What should women be able to do then?

A woman should never have a job that requires making decisions that might
lead to the death of another, that would include the President of the US or
Governor of any state, prison warden, certain judges, etc.

Women would make good mayors, sherrifs, senators, judges, lawyers, medical
doctors, business leaders, congresswomen, educators to a point, military
leaders to a very small point. Scientists and engineers to a point.

Women should not get Phds or other doctoral degree, although a medical
doctor or law degree is ok if used wisely and is not pursued to the
exclusion of all else in one's life.

Women should not be the President of any country or the governor of any
state, or a member of the highest court in the land, or any position that
involves commanding an entire army or state militia, but can participate in
all other government positions including sherrif as a sherrif involves
keeping the peace and not warfare which are two completely different things.

Women cannot be the head of a church, or one of it's leaders but may be a
prophet or teacher.

Women cannot be the head of a university, but may teach there, they can be
the head of a junior college or lower and teach as they will in all those
levels.
