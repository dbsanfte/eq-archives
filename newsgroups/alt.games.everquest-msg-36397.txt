Hard to say.  There was that time in Lower Guk when we had *5* FBSSs drop
over the span of a few hours.

Then there was the time in Tower of Frozen Shadow when 3 Tserrina robes
dropped, which is where I got mine.  Very distinctive look, you don't see
many of them.

But I think the best was when I got into the Magi camp in LGuk.  He spawned
15 minutes later and dropped the Shiny Metallic Robe.  I won the roll.

You got really lucky.  Conventional wisdom is that you get one FBSS dropped
a day.  When I was doing the Guk thing, we had people say things like "Oh
well, screw it, I'm leaving" when informed that the FBSS had dropped two
hours ago.  I spent a LOT of time in the Frenzy group.  Best EXP in Guk.

The kind of infantile child that I wouldn't want as guildleader.
