I don't think they ever avoided borrowing good ideas from other games,
I think they simply didn't like those ideas.  Brad McQuaid is quite
opposed to many of the changes that have been made to Everquest in the
last few years (see the Vanguard web site for what he thinks a game
should be like).

Not that I played back in the days of the iron-fisted Vision. ;-)

Or, alternatively, their view of what was a good idea changed as the
"old guard" left.
