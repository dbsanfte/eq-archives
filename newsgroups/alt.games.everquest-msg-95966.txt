I bet there are some guys ( and maybe some women ) who normally play in 1st 
person view, but, switch to a "behind" view when playing their female BL.

I was playing Messiah the other day and I posessed a "commander" ( humanoid 
female alien kinda chick ).  My wife comments: "How come all the women in 
the games you play have nice asses and tits?"  My reply: "Because they know 
I have a short attention span."
