Allegedly, Sony is adding more high-end solo content. I'm lucky that I
have a good group of friends from EQ1 to group with, and the pickup
groups I've been in have, with one PAINFUL exception, been very
good...good enough we're adding recruits to our guild from the random
strangers we've grouped with. You also have to look a little for solo
content -- for example, there's very little right outside Qeynos for
me to solo at my level, but at the Oracle Tower and the Steppes,
there's plenty of yellow and white mobs for me to kill.

The "Everybody wins!" model of questing - where, when you all have to
kill a Flummoxing Norgler, you ALL get credit for it, not just the one
person who loots the Flummoxing Norgler Spleen, really changes the
dynamic of the game. Instead of "Get away, that Norgler is MINE!!!",
you get "Hey, you here for the Norgler? Me too. Wanna group?" Since
you'll run less risk and get the same reward for the quest, ad-hoc
groups at spawn sites are a lot more common and friendly than in EQ1.

Yup. Here's the thing -- if they weren't, everyone would be a master
tradeskiller, and then, they'd be worthless. A good tradeskill system
should reward patience and attention to detail. Those who want fast
action and fast results should stick to hacking things. In a
well-designed system, only a small percentage of the player base
should be tradeskillers, but those who are should feel rewarded for
their efforts, not obliged to do it because their guild mandates it or
something.
