    There's a few options for you. One, take the boat from Freeport to
Butcherblock, then from Butcherblock to FV, jump off the boat before it goes
into the city, and run to LoIO. This would be so amazingly dangerous a route
that you should discard it out of hand. The second option is to get on the
raft in Oasis, go to Timorous Deep, avoid/kill the low level ogres on the
island there, get on the Bloated Belly, jump off the Bloated Belly before it
docks in the OT outpost, do a WIDE circle away from the outpost and run home
through Warslik's Woods. My monk did this at about your level, so it is
possible, but I did have Feign in case anything went wrong. The third option
is to get a port to the Dreadlands, and either run DL->FV->LoIO or
DL->FM->LoIO. The run through DL would likely be riskier than taking the
evil boat, unless you zone slowly. The final option is safest, but will cost
the most - ask a wizard if they could Translocate you to bind. This
teleports you directly to your bind point, which I assume is somewhere nice
and safe in Cabilis (my level 40 Iksar monk still has his newbie bind
point). Good luck!
