I play a 54 Ranger and do a lot of soloing in JPF. The other day I noticed
that I started my hunt with Wolf Form (WF) and my Lupine Dagger proc'd and I
got the red message "spell would not take hold on target" and so I stripped
off all my buffs except the WF and tried it again. Sure enough the Greater
Wolf Form (GWF) did not take. I then stripped the WF and like 2 hits later
the GFW took.

I am pretty sure I have never had this problem before.
Did they change something in a previous patch?
Thanks D.
