First, arming a pet does nothing for the pet's dam/dly unless the dam
of the weapon is more than half of the pet's "barehanded" damage, in
which case, it will do double the weapon damage.

Second, after level 39, the pet will not "dual wield" barehanded. You
have to give it two weapons for it to swing both hands. After 39, it
will swing both with or without a weapon.

Last, yes, stats on weapons do help pets, as do stats on armor.
