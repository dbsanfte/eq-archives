It is annoying, particularly given that it is all sorted alphabetically.

Examine the fuel on the merchant, it tells you what level it is for.

Precisely, which is why I hated the dependencies, particularly for my 
first chosed tradeskill.  My secondary tradeskill is now 2 levels higher 
than my primary due to this exact problem.

Level is not the important factor though.  In theory, the fanciness of 
the con does tell you about how difficult it is, just have not got it all 
figured out yet.  I did look through the options to turn it off, and was 
not able to find it, it is not obvious anyway.

Don't have a horse, so has not affected me, have heard complaints about 
the runspeed without sprint though.
