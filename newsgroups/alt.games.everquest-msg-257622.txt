They seem to be scaled to the model, but in an exagerated way. I
think the idea was to make them larger when you got further away
so they could be readable. No being 200 feet from something and
see the tag but not be able to read it... but they over did the
scaling way too much.

I thought they were fine the way they were.

//sigh//

If it aint broke.... dont fix it !!
