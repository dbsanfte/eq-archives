Yep this is true. I played offhours during that time (as in, I logged
in after midnight). The server population at that time of night, then
as now, was nowhere near what it was at primetime. I had *zero*
problems with lag, the game worked perfectly well when it had the
bandwidth available on ITS end.

After a couple weeks they added a third ISP, and at some point after
that put in a major pipe as an upgrade (OC-4 or something?). From that
point on, lag (true lag, as in latency, not framerate) was a nonfactor
in EQ (other than raids) until several years later.
