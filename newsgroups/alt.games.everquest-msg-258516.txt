Both.     Quests are the benefit to uberhighend raiders.   But they can make
very nice droppable things that non-raiders would use.   Didn't mean to
imply it was *only* used for quests.

I would be very amazed if they are not in the bazaar on your server.
Search for Velium Gemmed weapons.   6 on sale at the moment on E'ci, but
usually there are even more than that..  Those are all tradeskill made,
using drops from highend GoD zones.   Although I have to wonder about the
price James quoted : p   they're 20k on E'ci.

Because 400 mana = 7500 hp, perhaps?

The stats on two handers are generally 150% of the stats on one handers
dropped by the same mobs.

Pretty meager compensation for taking hundreds to thousands of points in
additional damage over a fight.

If you're willing to use it longer until it procs.   It varies by weapon,
but in general off hand wielded weapons take a pretty severe penalty to proc
rate.

And honestly...which weapons are you referring to?     The last one that was
regularly swapped in until it proc'ed, then swapped out was primal, during
the Velious / Luclin era.  (longer for some of us *grin*)

I suppose a soloing melee might use a slow weapon until it procs.   But
soloing melees isn't exactly what class balance is based on.   Nor should it
be.
