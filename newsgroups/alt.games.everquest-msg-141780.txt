Pozs are not that hard once you get over the ick factor :p That whole arena
area was being farmed for armor a week after velious opened and is no doubt
why the drop rate is so low now.

A balanced 55-60 group is fine for the area . What you cant have is multiple
adds so pull carefully. A druid/mage team pulling with snare coh works
great, or a monk who is always laying down and a tagger will work.

The sad part is that the armor really isnt that good though. Useless for
monks and and casters. Will be upgraded quickly even on clerics and tanks if
you raid just a little.
