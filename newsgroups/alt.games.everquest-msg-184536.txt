My suggestion would be a class that can heal. My ench has been sitting at
lvl 51 for a looong time now (mostly cuz I never play the ench any more,
bards're too much fun). But I could get 52 very quickly if I could just keep
my darned pet healed! Enchanter pets provide good damage output, just they
have all the hit points of a large rat with dysentry. So something that can
help heal is, IMO, A Good Thing(TM).

Enchanter/Druid for me (as enchanter) really worked very well. You get good
offense, snare, and healing. Oh, and teleports, which pre-PlanesOfPingpong
were very useful =) Druid/Ench combo gets particularly sick in certain
higher areas... guild has a pair with Dire Charm... heh perma-charm giant,
perma-charm wolf, what more do you need for sick damage output?
