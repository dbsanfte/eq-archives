I didn't log on 13-Feb so on 14-Feb I was updated with whatever recent
changes had been made. I noticed that I no longer get combat music when
hitting the auto-combat key. I still get zone music but that's it. I
asked and some other people mentioned the same thing. Has anyone else
seen this and is there a fix? It's not that big of a deal but after
hearing it for so long combat seems eerily quiet now. In fact, last
night I didn't realize that I hadn't hit my auto-combat key and was
chasing mobs around and wondering why they weren't dying, until I
noticed that the flashing target box wasn't lit. I need the music back
because I'm dumb!

=====================================================================
I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
