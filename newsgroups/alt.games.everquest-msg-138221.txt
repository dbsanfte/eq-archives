A RL Friend has an Axe of Dismay on loan from his Guild Leader, he lent it
to me and as I was about to return it I hit delete instead of closing the
window I wanted....I just froze, I didn't destroy but I took the next step
real carefully in declining the option to destroy the axe.

As said you'd have no problem doing this part, the X scale isn't no
drop...For the other 2 I'd suggest sitting in bazaar and joining whatever
auction channel your server has and ask to buy A and G scales...Wurmy's are
less than  1K now so the scales are prolly not worth that much to people...I
wonder if your druid friend couldn't just kite some hill giants in Rathe and
make the plat to buy one? With the Bazaar as it is I have seen some silly
prices, it truly is a buyers market, I'd be surprised if you couldn't pick
one up for 500pp.
