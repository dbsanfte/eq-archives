I dunno, Richard. I like you, (on Usenet... not *that* way, silly) but
at the end of the day what it sounds like is that you're getting upset
because you, as only a recruit, are asking the guild to make exceptions
to guild policy for you and change their routine and they don't want to
do it. Our guild is not a "raiding guild" and don't require members to
be part of the raid force. However, if you *do* join up with the raiders
we have, benefit from it, etc. and then start picking and choosing when
you are going or not, you're going to find yourself invited less and far
lower on the list to have a raid called to get you your epic or
what-have-you.

In raiding guilds, even more so. They already provided reasons why they
were raiding, and by signing on as a recruit you agreed to those
policies. Plus, it's a guild. By being in it, you also made an unspoken
agreement to follow the instructions and policies of the GL, the
officers, and the Raid Leader(s). 

I can sympathise with your dilemna, and fully understand your reasons
for wanting to do what you wanted to do, but again... at the end of the
day you were bucking the leadership and the rules. Even worse as a
probationary member. I really don't see where there's a question. You
asked. The answer was given. You didn't like the answer, but that's
pretty much the end of the discussion. 

Of course, I'm speaking as an elder in a 50+ guild and one of our Raid
Leaders, so my opinion may be a bit biased.  But if you through me in
that RL's position, I'd be looking a Monuel's application with a bit of
doubt at the moment.
