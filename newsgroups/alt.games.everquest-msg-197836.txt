First of all, IDWYS, you sound like a tit anyway.  Secondly, do you
*honestly* think there will never be patches to the perfection that is
Shadowbane?  No patches means: no new content, no bug fixes, no server
maintenence...just to name a few.  If that's your bag, have fun with
it.  Sounds like shit to me though.
