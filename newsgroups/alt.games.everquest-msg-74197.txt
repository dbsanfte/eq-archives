After moving to Antonius Bayle I've been guildless for a while but I want to
join a guild. My main is a level 31 necro (temporarily level 30 again after
an extended tourist trip to luclin!). I'd like a guild where that is an
average kind of level, but that I could also join with a lower level
character or two.

As a necro I'm happy soloing, or playing as a member of a group.
I'm looking for a guild that is primarily about having fun rather than a
bunch of high levels characters doing all they can to get XP and new
"stuff", although some of that is fine too.
My main reason for wanting to join is so I can take part in more organised
trips out to various dungeons and places rather than relying on pick up
groups going there. Obviously I'd want to be able to help out other members
whenever possible too.

None of the pick up groups I've been in have had any guilded members in so
it's been difficult for me to find out more about the options on this
server.

So are their any guilds there that I might fit into? And what's the best way
to get an invite? To contact members in-game and group with them for a while
to see how it works out I suppose.
