Says so on the page: =A9 Business Wire 2004=20

What ever gave you that impression? From the terms of use:

"You agree not to use the Business Wire Site for any other purposes,=20
including, without limitation, to store, aggregate, reproduce or=20
distribute information available on the Site in any manner  [...]"

The quality of truthfulness is orthagonal to the quality of ownership.=20
Don't post copyrighted material unless you own it [1]. But if you do,=20
please set the line wrap correctly.

Sorry, I can't find the part in that paragraph where it says you can=20
post it where ever you like, even if the line wrap is set correctly.

Actually, I don't really care if you choose to violate the law; but if=20
you're going to do it on usenet, at least set the line wrap correctly.

[1] Fair Use doctrine permits you to quote a portion of it, and then you=20
could have added the link (as you did) to the full text. That would not=20
have violated the authors rights in any way. But if you do, at least set=20
the line wrap correctly.
