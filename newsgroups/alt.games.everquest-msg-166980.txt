Yeah, I'll have to try that, thanks. It turns out I don't have much 
patience for AA grinding either, so I re-dinged (re-dung?) 54 and gave 
20% XP to AA. At least, with that ratio, both xp bars grow at the same 
speed.

By the way, thanks to all the people who recommended I got an Earring of 
the Solstice. Awesome item.
