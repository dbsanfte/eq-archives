This is more than enough, in comparison, I use a xp2100 (oc'd to 2400),
512mb ddr 3300 RAM, GeForce 3 Ti 128MB Graphics card, Win2k Pro.

My ping to the UK server (Venril Sathir), is around 100 (I think it may
actually be based in france but am not sure, did  a tracert the other day
but forget the outcome).

From the symptoms (ack how do you spell that ^_^) you describe, it sounds
more like a Frames Per Second problem, most likely your graphics cards
drivers.  If you are using XP, I cannot help much except to say, update your
drivers to the newest version, install DX9.  Also update or try using a
different mouse (try a usb mouse if you use a ps/2 and vice versa).

Check your virtual memory settings.

I ping around 5-30 on UK Counterstrike servers, on  a cable connection,
remember, these servers have a far far lower load than your average EQ
server, I think.

As I say, check your drivers, disable fast find (not sure on this, heard it
is a default setting in XP, I am no XP expert as I have hardly used it).

If the worst comes to the worst and you really cannot figure it out,
re-install, use win2kpro, and never look back :P

To sum up I would check these things:

Graphics card + Drivers
Sound card + Drivers
Mouse + Drivers
General Bios Settings (possibly set to pci init, or not set to apic, any of
those funky settings :) ).
RAM type and clock speed
Hard disk drive

Check with your cable  / dsl provider whether they are having any problems
(I doubt this is it as your ping is fine in other games).

Most of this is probably obvious, dont change many things at once, stick
with one thing, work through it logically and generally you will find the
problem easier (format + re-install is still my favourtite sure-fire cure
though).

On a side note to any gurus who may read this, I cannot change my own
virtual memory settings in win2k pro, when I change it, it just hards resets
my machine and the values I set dont remain, any ideas? :)
