But RNG can be your friend. I got my eye the third griffon I killed,
nearly first time in the zone.

But I don't like downtime. Quadding means you are oom at some point.
What I like to do is root griffon, griffon, anaconda, anaconda etc
epic dot, winged, velious bracer.. reroot redot as needed, be nearly
FM when all four or so die.

I'm betting it takes about the same amount of time but the difference
is its all more active. I'm not just sitting doing nothing and medding
up.

On the tribunal its nearly always empty, with no one else doing mobs
so for me as a 56 druid it is a good xp zone. I get a couple light
blue griffs and blue anacondas at a time and leisurely kill them.
There are a couple good spots where I'm lazy as heck doing it since
more pop all the time it seems.

I got tired of any downtime long ago so never really took up quadding.
Its too downtime intensive, too selfish and too messy. Its dependant
on other customers not enforcing their rights to also get some spawns
from the area. Catch as you can by sight with rooting and doting just
works better. Most "quad" zones have static spawns which make it even
more unlikely that someone will just let you have them all. You have
to share, so its a silly strategy to get locked into. Jaggedpine is
great for the randomness.

Besides all of that, griffon and anaconda meat have some value while 
plat shoots which are a forage are also used in several baking skills.
For a druid like me its just a great zone. For the most part its aggro
free in wolf form, trained potatoheads are the only things likely to
ever bother me but at night when I play the zone is empty nearly all
the time. XP is not everything, but though I only play a couple hours
every few days I have got an AA half point screwing around in
jaggedpine.
