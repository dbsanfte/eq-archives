    That's a bit like saying its up to the tanks whether they feel their
time is best spent taunting the mob off you before you die or taking down
the one they're on. Tanks have at least as much of an idea of what your
buffs do for them as you do.

    As a tank ill quite happly make sure I die before you do, but when I ask
for a particular buff it's not because I'm a greedy buffaholic - it's
because I see it as necessary, and I'd be quite a bit pissed off if I died
all the sooner protecting you because you refused to buff me.

    A druid who refuses to buff and an enchanter who refused to cast their
best haste for the group? I would overlook both of those characters next
time they were LFG. Alacrity lasts a long time, not as long as augmentation
but long enough, and if you're in a melee heavy group your mana is better
spent upping their output than anything else you've got to offer, unless you
find yourself oom when mezzes are needed.

    Sure, argue the point, discussion is good, tactical discussion is great.
But to flat out refuse? Tanks do a lot of things in a group that wouldn't do
solo, and would really rather not do for their own sake, but do for the good
of the group. Casters do too.
