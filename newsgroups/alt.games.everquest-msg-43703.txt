I am not a farmer, and I could really care less whether a mob that is green has
an item (if I want to twink I'll go to EC with a pile of cash, or make stuff
for my newbie). I still voted against, for the same reason I support radar
detectors being legal despite the fact that I rarely speed, and by little when
I do. I don't believe in being forced to behave in a way that someone else
dictates.
