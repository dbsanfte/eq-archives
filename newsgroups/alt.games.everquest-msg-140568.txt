Since I'm both lazy and paranoid, doing nothing is a lot
better than checking a price that may be manipulated </snip>

Lol boy wonder if you interested enough to look for the items your wanting
in the bazaar or do you just look at the vendors standing next to you and
hope they have what your looking for and pay whatever prices they want.
Your probably one of the people that try to sell items in bazaar for days
with outrageous prices and when noone is stupid enough to pay what your
asking then you flood the zone with one line /auctions selling useless junk
for inflated prices COME SEE ME! and by god if that doesn't work you
probably won't hesitate to take it to the auction channel.
The mentality of yourself and people like you discgust me.
