Lake of Ill Omen, that would be LoIO, not oiol.  If you are doing it because
your are dyslexic, then please accept my apology.  If you look carefully at
your keyboard, you will find two keys that are generally labeled "Shift",
they come in very handy when you want people to read what you have to write.
Another key that I have found very handy is the one right next to the ","
that you seem to have found.  It has a "." on it.  You will find that more
people will be inclined to answer the questions you are asking if you make
at least an attempt at writing in something approaching the generally
accepted norm for English.  If you don't you are likely to find a lot of
replies more like this one to most anything you ask.
