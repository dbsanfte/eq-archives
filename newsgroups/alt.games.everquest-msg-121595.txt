First, I was already aware that the Constitution only protects us from
Congress.  That does not change the fact that others can and sometimes do
violate rights to free speech.  That was just the point I was making.

As for the company having the right to do what it tried to do, maybe it did
and maybe it didn't.  The specifics are a bit detailed and not worth
bothering over.  I am sure the company wanted the employee to not write the
paper because it did not like the publicity it saw itself getting, then
withdrew the proposal to terminate the employee more in fear of getting
still more publicity than of the threatened lawsuit.  I should say, though,
that the employee never accused the company of any wrongdoing, and the death
did not occur on company property, nor due to any actions taken by company
employees.  The company's only involvement in the matter was that the guy
killed and the guy complaining to the paper knew each other from having
worked together in that company.  I think management was being overly
sensitive, and in proposing termination, violated his rights to free speech.
Not his rights as expressly secured under the Constitution, but then again,
the Constitution sets the very lowest level rights can ever be legislated
to; many laws exist to give the public even more rights to free speech,
among other things, and I suspect that the organization violated those
rights.

You from America?  If so, then your network television is regulated by the
FCC.  The stations censor themselves to avoid stiff fines.  I can't say what
the situation is in other countries, except Germany, where soft porn is not
unusual on ordinary TV broadcasts at night.
