I had the same experience, albeit after being out of the trading game for
a few months -- cleared out my mules of all the variously rat-holed
foraged, and looted stuff, and 15 minutes after turning trader on, was
12kpp ahead.  The problem is, prices on things to buy have increased at an
equal -- or greater -- rate.  People seem in the last week to be buying
stuff up to convert plat into items.  From what I've read, there's a
reason for this..  Hope they fixed the bug, if that's what it was.

Anyway, the reason for posting is, have you tried a horse?  The rope 
bridles top out at 9.5kpp, and are well worth it for the mana regen alone.  
Slower than dirt, but you can always /dismount or click the icon off and 
run to the next place you'll be standing around.  I'm so enamored I've 
gotten one for my 52 druid and 38 ranger alt both.  This is after sitting 
down and trying to find something to buy that would qualitatively improve 
my toons more, and failing.  As someone else noted, if you can fill a 
focus slot with the same money, that might be better, but if not -- go for 
the horsie.  The best thing about this option is, NPCs haven't currently 
spiked their prices in response to the dupe exploit. :)
