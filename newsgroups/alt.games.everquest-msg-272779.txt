I'm attempting to use Everquest 2 on a laptop for when I travel.  It is
a Dell D600 with an ATI Radeo 9000.  The game loads fine but when I get
into it different areas are colored strange and it drags.  I updated
the video drivers to the latest. version and I hae the same problem
with colors and the screen updates seem even slower.  I checked the
compatability with SOE and it passes and shows to be compatible.  I
wonder if there is a setting in the ATI stuff that is causing problems.
Anyone have any suggestion?
