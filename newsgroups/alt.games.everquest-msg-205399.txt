This is a quick explanation of how an EQ Casino works, and a quick bit
of math to show what a rip off they are. Using /random, the random
number generator, you challenge a player to roll better then a certain
number, and they bet against that. There are two parts to this, one is
to get as many people as possible to bet, and two to create the
illusion that they will win.

We all know about the first part of this grift. Endless spam messages.
Shout a thousand times to get a hundred people to bet a 10pp at a
time.

The second part is the illusion that you will win. I am here to tell
you that unequivocally you will lose. You can not win the casino
racket, unless you are the house.

In almost every wagering system, the house always has the advantage.
At 1% this is considered fair, they win 51% of the time and you win
49% of the time.

When it gets to 2% (52%) or 3% (53%) it is a tough house. At Poker
houses, in Florida the house keeps the first ante of 25 cents, the
rest of the bets go to the winner of the hand. Unfortunately, the pot
limit is $10, so you don't win big.

Casinos in EQ as they are run now, are unfair, because the winning
percentage is very high. Here is an easy analysis of the average
ripoff casino.

/shout Come to another_loser_00's casino, roll 650 or better on
/random 1000 and win your bet. Minimum bet 10pp. I am in the worst
place possible for you to use the bank in peace and quiet.

If you roll over 650 on a 1000 that occurs 34.99% of the time and you
get 10pp. If you don't that occurs 65% of the time, and you pay 10pp.

To calculate the odds of winning you multiply the odds of each
condition occurring and multiply again by the ways you can make that
condition. For three rolls, if you wanted to know the chance of
scoring at EXACTLY one win, you multiply the odds (0.35 and 0.65) and
multiply by the number of ways to make that. There are three ways to
make one out of three.

CHANCE_OF_1_OUT_3 =((0.35)*(0.65)*(0.65))*3= 0.443

That is you have a 44 percent chance of making exactly one win and two
losses. In that case you lose 10pp.
 
For at least one win you add the chance of one win plus the chance of
two plus the chance of three.

CHANCE_OF_1_OUT_3 =(0.35)*(0.65)*(0.65)*3=0.443
CHANCE_OF_2_OUT_3 =(0.35)*(0.35)*(0.65)*3=0.238
CHANCE_OF_3_OUT_3 =(0.35)*(0.35)*(0.35)*1=0.042

TOTAL CHANCE = 0.723 (rounded) or 72%

To skunk three out of three:
CHANCE_OF_0_OUT_3 =(0.65)*(0.65)*(0.65)= 0.275 or 27%

If you do this ten times, you may win three times (rounding) and the
house won seven times. You got 30pp and you paid in lost bets 70pp.
You gave him 40pp. If you have good luck you win five times and he
wins five times. You lost nothing, and you won nothing. This is called
a push.

Let calculate how often the win or push condition occurs. You have not
lost anything. That means you win or break even. Anything besides you
winning or pushing means the house wins.

TOTAL_CHANCE = CHANCE_OF_5_OUT_10   CHANCE_OF_6_OUT_10  
CHANCE_OF_7_OUT_10   CHANCE_OF_8_OUT_10  CHANCE_OF_9_OUT_10  
CHANCE_OF_10_OUT_10

CHANCE_OF_5_OUT_10 = ((.35)^5*(.65)^5)*262 = 16%
(262 because there are 262 ways to make 5 wins from 10 chances, look
it up, this is basic probability)
CHANCE_OF_6_OUT_10 = ((.35)^6*(.65)^4)*210 = 7%
CHANCE_OF_7_OUT_10 = ((.35)^7*(.65)^3)*120 = 2%
CHANCE_OF_8_OUT_10 = ((.35)^8*(.65)^2)*45 = 0.4%
CHANCE_OF_9_OUT_10 = ((.35)^9*(.65)^1)*10 = 0.05%
CHANCE_OF_10_OUT_10 = ((.35)^10)*1 =  0.002% (36250:1)

Out of ten rolls, you win or push 25% of the time. You push, 16% of
those times. You actually win anything only 10% (9.5%) of the time.
That means you make 10pp or more 10% of the time, break even 16% of
the time.

That means the Casino wins or pushes 75% of the time. They win at
least one bet or more 59% of the time.  Like I said a rip off.

Spread the word. Post this on guild message boards. Tell them Srie on
Morell Thule did the math, and she is a crafty business woman! You may
