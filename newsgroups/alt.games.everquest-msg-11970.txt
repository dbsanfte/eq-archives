Well that wasn't as bad as I expected, only two rangers responded and
both were spot on when it came to assessing the problem.  Its not the
ranger class that has the issue with sucking up heals, its a subset of
the class that is made up of players who never figured out that sucking
up too many heals is bad.  I agree with both of you, rangers who know
when to stop climbing the hate ladder do good work, its those other ones
that just have to be on top that give them a bad name, same as with any
other class that shouldn't be there.  I put rangers in the same group as
wizards, I'm always concerned when we add one to the group till I see
how they play, but playing with one who knows what they are doing can
make for a very good show.
