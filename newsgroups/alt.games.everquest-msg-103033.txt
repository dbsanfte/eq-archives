Actually verant said they were randomizing all higher uber spawns.
Perhaps they count VSR as one. This was in order to stop people from
"spawn timing." That was the exact way that I got VSR, I knew when
someone killed him and just continued checking from 5:30 am my time to
7 am and he finally popped, before this more recent change.

Now they just need to randomize hadden from 1 minute to 6 hours
instead of 6 hours ;)
