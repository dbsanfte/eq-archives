Yeah, but to get to the "easier" dragons, you kinda have to go through
Aary (I guess you can gimp them now that most are perma-rooted).

As for "significantly weaker", not anymore.
In some ways the "weaker" dragons are more of a pain now.  Vyemm is
perma rooted.  Given this, positioning him is drop dead easy, making
his AE mostly meaningless.  So you have to just deal with his 1150
pops.  Tough, but not impossible.

In some ways, I consider that Hoshkar clone to be more of an annoyance
since that Disease Cloud can still fuck over your melees making aggro
control tricky (unless you have someone chain curing the melees).

Try it with a 55 warrior.
Even with top of the line droppable gear from PoP, a level 55 warrior
would simply get chewed up and spit out by the AEs alone.  5 level
difference is HUGE when it comes to resisting AE nukes.

And good fucking luck having that 55 warrior hold aggro when Aary
drops that -300 ATK debuff on him.  Whiff, whiff, whiff, whiff, slash
for 1 hit point, whiff, whiff, slash for 3 hit points, whiff...yeah,
great taunt there.  Oh let me guess, he's going to use that uber-leet
TAUNT skill on a deep fucking red con dragon right?

>NAKED 60 BARDS have tanked nToV dragons (bored uber guilds back in the day)

A naked level 60 bard, fully buffed with level 65 cleric/shammy/druid
buffs would have what about 3000 to 3500hps (?) and will have sub-1000
AC.  Tank Aray with that?  Right....

Now a level 65, when Aray cons yellow, may be able to tank with
sub-par equipment--at least until someone gets Turgur on Aary.

When level 60's were the maximum (and I mean pre-Luclin), the
"tankers" were warriors under defensive.  In order for a level 60 SK
to tank, they would need elemental drops from PoP.  Oh wait!
Elemental drops from PoP *requires* you to be level 62+ to even equip
it (most require level 65)!

Now, you want to tell me which level 60 SK is going to tank a quad
900+ dragon?

Golly no shit.
Never would have figured that out.  Oh wait, I did mention what's
going to fuck you over is the AE and not the melee.  Darn.
