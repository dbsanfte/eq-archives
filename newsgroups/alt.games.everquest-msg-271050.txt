It's just distance. The mob you're targetting is out of a set distance
the pet won't cross. I do believe it's somewhere between 150-200 units.
When you or the mob walks into this range the pet will attack and even
follow the mob out of this range then. So order your pet to back off
unless you want it to jump the mob as soon as possible. :)
