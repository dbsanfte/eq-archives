Yes indeed.  Though honestly if you have such problems aggroing through
walls you may need to look at how you approach pulls.  Only place I can
think of where aggro through walls is a true problem is on the way up to
Saryn.

Or perhaps your definition of "complex" is at a much lower bar than mine.

I so agree, particularly after losing another collection mission by one item
(which of course dropped on the next kill).

If *I'm* losing collection missions, they need to be tuned.

Doesn't sound like you were paying attention during that class.

My experience with literally hundreds of other clerics over the past few

So you don't adjust your healing and sitting when you need to be more
careful with your mana?

Or you do?

One way or the other.  Either you switch into a more efficient mode of
playing with necessary (as any good cleric does), or you don't.  This
doesn't mean that the entire rest of the time you never sit down (or maybe
it does to you, if that's the only concept you have of being efficient).

Please point out where in the bit you just quoted the cleric in example is
using mana at all, much less wasting it.  I talk about catching a tick, and
you see it as "espousing wasting mana".  If the best response you can come
up with to me is random inane comments, why bother?

I'll say it again.  Parse some mob DPS with various sorts of tanks. 
Seriously, you might be amazed at what you find out.

Again, random spouting, no matter how many numbers you throw at it, is still
nothing more than random spouting.  Your "every 22 and a half seconds..."
and "every 37 and a half seconds..." are obviously talking about having each
person as a permanent tank, respectively.  Great, now you've shown why
groups choose warriors to tank instead of rangers.

Welcome to 1999.  Now, add 4 years experience to that and you may see how a
celest followed by a CH produces a full health ranger at the end of a fight
where the warrior went LD.  I'm pretty sure that's what the original
discussion entailed, though you've snipped vast portions and then proceeded
to try to respond to that which you snipped, so I'm not sure.  Not
coincidentally, you seem to be confused as well.  Tell me, did you feel you
had won a large victory arguing that warriors make better tanks than
rangers?  :P

Makes one question why you brought it up at all...

I always thought temp (and virtue for that matter) were overpriced.  You pay
for the duration, not the actual quality of effect.  So, in a rough
situation it might be wiser to drop a symbol and hero.  First of all, this
spreads out when you spend the mana, giving the ability to toss a heal in
the middle if necessary for instance.  Secondly, this adventure is gonna be
over soon anyway, so seeing as you're halfway through already the duration
shouldn't be an issue (and you're going to want to reset the timers between
adventures anyway probably, at least I generally re-buff virtue between
adventures even if I know it should probably last through another run).  And
of course, finally, the symbol and hero will act as heals themselves when
cast mid-fight (as would temperance, but on top of the very long casting
time of temperance, see above for various reasons it may not be the best
choice at that moment).  In other words, adjust.

As far as my monk goes, I was *much* farther ahead of the "average" monk
about a year ago.  These days you can get uncomfortably close to my
hardcore-raiding-required gear by simply dropping a few hundred thousand
platinum in the Bazaar.

Perhaps I'd agree.  But then I'd go farther and say that most everybody is. 
It's a throwback to the old days of mass quantity grinding.  I simply still
remember how it works, while a lot of people have apparently lost that
knowledge.

I'm curious about this statement.  You want me to go spend 40k on a twink
ranger that is probably dressed in about 40k worth of equipment...  I don't
get it.

And then you want me to go through a hard adventure, apparently while
pretending I'm doing the normal difficulty that has been the subject of most
of this discussion...  I still don't get it.

And then you want me to find a whole group of level 50-ish characters with
not a single twink in the bunch...  now I *really* don't get it.  That's so
unlikely on my server that I'd sooner bet on getting hit by lightning... 
twice.
