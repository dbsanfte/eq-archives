I disagree.  My prices are at the upper end anyways and I know that.
They are set there so that people can haggle if they want or make a
lower offer and we can meet in the middle yet it will never cease to
amaze me that people can see OBO or "Prices Negotiable" and then
simply pay me what I am auctioning it for.  

I I just said prices are negotiable, why would you not at least ASK if
I will take 275 or 250 for an item I am listing at 300?  If I say
"sure" you safe money, if not then you pay what you were originally
willing to pay anyway:-)
