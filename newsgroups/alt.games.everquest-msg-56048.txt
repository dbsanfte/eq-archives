I've yet to find a spell that was like this. (Granted, I've never played a
wizzy past 10 ;-) If it's available to more than one class and sold in
that classes guild then another class can buy it and scribe it. I've done
that for many of my enchanters "research-only" spells that happen to be
available to shamans.

But... looking at eq.castersrealm.com they only list two known locations
you can get the spell (lists as Vendor?) Great Divide and Skyshrine.
