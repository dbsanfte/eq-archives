Thanks for your ideas.
But yep, tried, AGP 2X instead of 4X, Can't reinstall directx8.1, it's XP
and it comes with it and tells you to "rack off".

I am going to try to go back to win98 now.
My prob was that I am using 2 40G seagate barracudas in raid mode 0 and when
I fdisked the array it reported it as being only a 10G drive.
XP with the raid driver loaded during install quite happily set up an NTFS
partition for the full amount.
Just discovered that fdisk has a purely cosmetic limitation of 64G, and
though it was saying it was a 10 gig it had partitioned it properly. :)

All that ramble is to say I thought I was limited to XP and am happy to go
back to win98. *crosses fingers*. hope this fixes it.
