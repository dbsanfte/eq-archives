I had first found this on the www.everlore.com board, and had meant to
post this but didn't get around to it.  The actual thread is at:

http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=ffc3d6f27d0b450b317e216353bf9a55&threadid=23527

I never even knew this player but I was moved reading about him.

For those of you on Bristlebane, I'm sure you've heard of Xoleres
Whitewolf... for the rest of you, 

Xoleres was the first and best legend of Bristlebane. He was a good
man, a great leader, and a friend to those who crossed his path. 

He led the first Vox slaying on Bristlebane, and was a force in the
first killing of Nagafen. In fact, the GM's later replaced his surname
with that of "Dragonslayer". He founded the guild known as Ring of
Valor - for Bristlebane old-timers I need say no more than the guild's
name to elicit the honor associated with this name. 

In February 2001, as Xoleres was driving home from a friend's house,
he was killed by a drunk driver. 

Recent EQ scams made many skeptical about his death, but after some
confirmations we determined that this was true... either way this is
not the point of my post. 

Last night was his memorial service. Over 60 people attended,
including our Server GM. The logs can be found here.

Rest in peace, friend.
