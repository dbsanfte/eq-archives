Dan, while it may show up two posts above this thread in your newsreader
using your news server, there is no guarantee at all that it has even
reached his.  Just something to keep in mind when making observations such
as that.  It so happens, it is in the same place for me.  OTOH, I see many
replies to posts that have not shown up yet, or, in some cases, ever.
Propagation is spotty.
