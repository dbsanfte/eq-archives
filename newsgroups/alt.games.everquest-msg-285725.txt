I played Vanguard all through beta and it did one thing faster than any 
other MMORPG has been able to do.  It bored me to tears.  In just 6 
weeks time I found that anything was preferable to logging in and 
playing VG.  I forced myself to login and test because that was what I 
applied to beta for.

I already own games similar to VG that are not only better but well 
established also.

I am happy for those that like it.  I wish I was one, but I am not.
