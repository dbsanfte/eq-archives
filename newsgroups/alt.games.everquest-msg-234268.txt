Sorry, don't know the deal, but will answer generally based on what I know
about EQ and the usual "free" trial period.

No, when you buy Everquest you pay for the software and then you get 30 days
free playtime before your credit card starts getting charged. You will have
access to the full game, doing anything and everything that any of us can do
and will be able to continue with all of your experience, skills, characters
and possessions when the 30 days expires, but you'll have to start paying
the monthly fee. The default is to automatically renew billing unless you
explicitly cancel, so they will keep charging your credit card until you
tell them to stop.

Yeah, see above.

There's no "trial" characters, just a trial "period", during which you are
playing full EverQuest and not paying for it.

> 4. Will I have access to everything on basic EQ?

I think I answered all of your questions in the first paragraph. ;-)

Good luck, see you there.
