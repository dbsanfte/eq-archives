The approach you take depends on your level.  At level 12, I was able to buy
them with benevolence to keep the guards from killing me, then casting minor
illusion while standing next to a merchant, so that the merchant would talk
to me.

I don't know how well the brownies like Dark Elves, so you may also want to
try Illusion Gnome, too.

At higher levels, Illusion Spirit Wolf is all you need, assuming that you
haven't killed any brownies.
