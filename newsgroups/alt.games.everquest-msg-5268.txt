Sounds like you forgot to hit the Optional Patch button.  I did that too. :)
HOPEFULLY you did that with your enchanter and not your monk 'cause when you
do patch and log in you'll be at 0,0 in the zone...and that is a square room
with no door.  If it's your monk you'll have to petition.  If your
enchanter, either petition or gate out (depending on where you're bound).
