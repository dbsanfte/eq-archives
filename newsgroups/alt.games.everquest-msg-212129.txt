According to Lucy, Spirit of Shrew (80 mana) and Pack Shrew (320
mana) also give Ultravision, duration of both is 36 minutes.
Spirit of Shrew class/level SHM/29, DRU/34, BST/39, RNG/44
Pack Shrew class/level SHM/34, DRU/39, BST/44, RNG/49

This is just from the spdat tho, no items shown and I've not played
on Test in months so I've no idea if the spells are really available
even there.
