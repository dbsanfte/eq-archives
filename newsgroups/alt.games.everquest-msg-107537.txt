"-All- He wants to do is show that a character having a higher AC 'stat' is
not necessarily better prepared for combat."

But that's not shown in any conclusive way.  He introduced variables that
not only *might* influence the results, but in fact "common knowledge"
suggests that those variables are a *bigger* impact on the test results than
the actual single variable he wanted to test.

/em goes to look up Myasthenia Gravis

Damn, we're screwed.

No, actually he wants to test whether a quarter and a penny come up heads
the same frequency of times.  The penny he flips high into the air, the
quarter he drops flat onto a table from an inch high.  If you bias the tests
enough, you can in fact prove that quarters never ever land on tails.
