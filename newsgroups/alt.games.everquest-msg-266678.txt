ROFLMAO! yeah....thats the one. i like players who are creatively
obnoxious to the point where its comical and you never know what
material they are gonna come up with next. I have a monk on 7th hammer
named Linvarweni and i ooc as a paladin LFG. its just not the
same....yes imitation is flattery but to not do it right is lame.
