I have an Iksar BL alt (lvl 10 - I don't use him much right now)

Depends on if you plan on twinking your BL or not. If you do, then go with
1hb or Piercing. If you don't, then go with Hand-To-Hand, because you'll be
able to fight right away and you can pick up a Polished Steel Ulak cheap.

When you get high enough to dual wield, go for a 1hb in one hand and a
hand-to-hand weapon in the other. (The BL epic weapons are hand-to-hand, but
there are a lot of nice 1hb weapons out there)

(For the record, I twinked my BL with a Crystalline Spider Fang and 1 Dex
item (Executioner's Hood) and it procs enough to make it worth using)
