I agree.
It seems that 1-10 is trivialised, but the skill and equipment/cash lag
will catch non twinks out.
The bonuses 10-30 need more investigation, but even if it is now really
easy it definatly is not trivial.
From these results it looks like 30-50 is OK (In fact almost exactly
what I would have done)
And we know that 50-60 has not changed.

So I guess we can stop worrying untill eq has another bithday.
