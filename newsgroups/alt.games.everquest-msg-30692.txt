From what I've heard, the griefers rarely make it past level 10.  If you can
make it past that level, you'll be ok.  But while you're under level 10,
your whole day can be ruined by one person just because they think it'd be
fun.

I've been there before.  No thanks.  If a game came out with a workable PvP
system, with appropriate checks and balances in it, then I might be
interested in checking it out, but so far that hasn't happened.
