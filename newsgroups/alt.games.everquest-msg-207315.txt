I think it depends on what you consider "risk". 

Personally I see "risk" as the potential for yourself group or raid to
wipe. The "risk" is in the encounter you face. Corpse/Wipe recovery is
nothing more than a time sink. It's about as anti-RP as you can get.
It really isn't even very "risky" if you plan ahead and have the right
tools/mules (corpse draggers/summoners).

I also don't consider forcing players to bring along a "Corpse
Summoning" class or face a 2-3 hour CR (and possible multiple deaths)
as a valid way of making certain classes more "raid friendly". It
merely encourages players to produce mules or park alts nearby.

Finally one of the main reasons why I quit playing at raid levels and
stay a perpetual lowbie is the fact that far too often players get
"trapped" in raid situations. When you have a limited play schedule
you simply cannot afford to be get routinely stuck for 2-3 hours on a
bad raid recovery. I might still be playing at raid levels if
"graveyards" were common to all raid level zones. I would gladly take
an EXP death in order to camp out when my play session is over and I
don't have the time to go through a 2-3 hour recovery that usually
results in the raid being called anyway.
