In what concievable way is this an "exploit"?

Some mobs hate each other, like some will frenzy to help each other
even if you aren't KOS to them directly.

The only way I can imagine this is an exploit would be if the newbie
guards were used (as they are deliberately overpowered to protect newbies)

On the other hand, newbies use those guards every minute of every day to
save themselves from death... should every account on every server be
banned because I'm -sure- they all did this at least once.

Use the example I post where I pull Drakkal wolves to Coldain.  Are the
coldain
guards here?  I could just as easily pull Coldain to the Drakkal wolves,
would you
say -those- are guards?  I use the term "guard" very losely in the post I
wrote, but
did make a point of noting that I meant -any- mob that will attack a second
mob,
not just the strict meaning of humaniforms in uniforms patrolling city
entrances.
