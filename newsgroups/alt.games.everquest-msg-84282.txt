Actually, I did say that soon after SoL came out, and no one flamed
me.  :-)

SoL was clearly rushed to hit Christmas, and it shows, not just in the
poor rollout, but in the cheesy rules.  E.g., CotH not working in a
lot of places.  I can understand CotH not working in, say, PoA,
because that zone came out before CotH was added, and CotH would make
the zone a lot easier than it was intended to be.  All the SoL zones
were designed after CotH was added to the game, and it is very cheesy
to simply make the spell not work there.  Maybe I'm just getting
conservative in my old age, but it seems to me EQ had a wonderful
unity back before Kunark.  Kunark introduced some serious problems,
but they were managable.  SoV was a pretty good expansion, but started
a serious round of mudflation.  With SoL, things have become too
disjoint...it's more like it is now the Everquest suite of games,
rather than a single game.
