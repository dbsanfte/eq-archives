Hate to break it to you guys, but explosives are already in game. The
quest to get the crest of the fauns in WL requires you to mix up
explosives (combine crushed herbs and crystallized sulfur in a special
container) and blow up some construction the giants are doing. You take
about 1000 pts. of damage from the resulting blast. =P If you survive,
you get proof of the destruction which, when turned in, gets you the
crest.
