-- Did the FM route last night with no problem. Had levitate, at one
point it ran out and so did Invis. vs. Animals and a Burnyai
"something" was strolling my way, I didn't take time to con it and I
got back up and going before it got close enough to bother me.  Thanks
for all the advice.  I have another question which exposes my
ignorance though: Is Invisibility a Shaman spell? If so, what level
should I have it at? I think I am up to speed on my spells but may
have overlooked a few.

Thanks again,
- Robert.
