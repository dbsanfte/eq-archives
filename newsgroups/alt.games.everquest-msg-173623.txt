Actually, in a case like the situation Lance describes, with bids
rather than fixed costs, the casual player gets a better deal in
terms of loot/raid than the regular contributor because he doesn't
usually have to spend as many of his frequent flyer miles to get
his toys.  OTOH, old reliable gets the new toys when they're still
new, and so has a bigger/faster/louder/brighter/fancier/whatever
kit (complete with shrunken ruler to create the illusion of larger
penis) than the part-time players.
