Since you can't "own" a mob, there is no "should have".

Contrast it with the EQ system 42 has elaborated upon.
Where you'd get 100, 100, for the first two
Then on the third one - you tanking, someone doing "massive damage"
sounds like they did the majority of the damage so you'd get 0 exp.
The last one you'd get 0 for since you only did 5%.

Seems like the 245 in CoH is better than 200 you'd get in EQ.

In CoH you'd also get influence and possibly an inspiration or
enhancement for number 3 as well.

And it all depends on if that behavior is permitted or not and if you
are permitted to "own" a mob in that game.

Frankly, i'd have walked away and let the golem kill the vultures and/or
pull a few more golems in.

Amazing how vultures go away when they get killed trying to leech.
