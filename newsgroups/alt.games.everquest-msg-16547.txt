Los Angeles...Van Nuys to be exact...you know...porn capital of the US...

Can't throw a rock in this town without hitting a stripper in the head...all
those poor strippers laying outside my place with big lumps on their
heads...heehee

Was actually caught offguard last night...roomate and I decided to head to
the movies...girl I know works across the street from the theaters at a
restaraunt and is the spitting image of Angelina Jolie...so we went in for
dinner and to ask her to go with us...she had already seen the movie but we
invited her for a drink after work...decided to skip the movie and go to a
real bar...followed her home so she could change...next thing I know I'm
standing in the living room of her house surrounded by nothing but beautiful
women asking if I'd go to a bar with them...

EQ...what's EQ?

Invited me back on Saturday night for dinner...for some reason...getting to
lvl 40 just doesn't seem as important as it did before.
