Well, sure.  The math is simple and obvious.  That doesn't make
it "stupid" for a player to split the xp tho.  It's a game, it's
supposed to be fun, not everybody gets a kick out of minmaxing
game mechanics.  Some folks enjoy watching both xp bars fill at
the same time.  If there's anything "stupid" involved here, it's
taking an choice that's totally subjective, with no impact on any
other player, and pronouncing any way other than John's way of
having fun with it "stupid".
