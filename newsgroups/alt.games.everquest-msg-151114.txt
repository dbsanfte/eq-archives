I still have 8 characters on Tunare, plus a couple scattered on other
servers... but kitty is the one I'm focusing on most now. I've found
that he can almost keep up with my druid's quad-kite killrate solo
meleeing. ><

As far as the pet's damage output goes, it's weird. No, he's not quad
or even triple hitting anywhere remotely near as often as before, but
it seems the damage output is close still between the upgraded proc
and higher hit accuracy. I still would rather see their double-attack
skill boosted back up, even if that means lowering their accuracy back
down a bit. More chances to land a hit tends to mean more hits
overall...
