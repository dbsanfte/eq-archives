Anything that you can simply buy at a jewlery or spell component
vendor probably won't sell too well. Exceptions might be given on the
really expensive stuff, like rubies and the like, if you're willing to
sell them for far less than a vendor's cost.  That being said, I have
yet to see a ruby fall off a mob...

You might be able to sell Peridots pretty well.  They're used by
clerics in thier symbol line spells, and they'll never pass up the
opportunity to pick a couple up on the cheap.  Otherwise, only the
very high-level gems, the dropped only stuff like blue diamonds,
Janciths, Black Sapphires, and Diamonds sell at all.  These are all
used in the very high end, very sought after jewerly market, and
vendors do not carry them in bulk.
