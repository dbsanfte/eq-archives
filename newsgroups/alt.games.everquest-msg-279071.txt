I think the rewards are definately sufficient.  RoV and RE have amazing
drops and XP.  I think the main problem with getting a group in those
dungeons is they are not easy.  If you get in a bad group in RE, you
can easily wipe multiple times, especially on shard recoveries - same
with RoV, but to a lesser extent.  Because the dungeons are hard, a lot
of people are afraid of pick-up groups in them (I was in one last
weekend - it was an accident waiting to happen, both the tank and the
necro were doing their best to wipe us).

If you do get in a group, the XP is crazy and the drops equally so.
The Tempered Clay (34^^^ golem) drops T4 stuff, including rares - I
wouldn't be surprised if all named did in RoV.  The legs and chest
quest in RE are great for that level range.  Even the normal mobs drop
great vendor loot and high T3 spells.  It isn't unheard of to burn
through levels while you are there, because the mobs are closely packed
and seemingly endless.

Another reason they are left alone is because it is so easy to solo
now.  You don't need a group if you don't want one.  A lot of people
don't like pick-up groups, and would rather solo than deal with them.
You can't solo very much in the dungeons, so people stay in the outdoor
zones.
