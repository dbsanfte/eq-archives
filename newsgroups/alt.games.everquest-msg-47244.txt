Im white but I wouldnt say im 'proud' to be white, anymore than im proud to
have brown hair. The colour of my skin is something I had no choice in and see
no reason to draw pride from the amount, or lack thereof, of pigment in my
skin.
My ability to fart at will, now 'there' is something to be proud of! (wonder if
thats a genetic thing?)
