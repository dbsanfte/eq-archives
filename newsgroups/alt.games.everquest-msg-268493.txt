God, I hate that. From the WoW site on the RP server policy:

I include that third point because, note that it doesn't say the
general channel is included in the "Absolutely no OOC" list.

As for people claiming "hi" isn't "RP", what the hell?! Are these the
nutjob morons who think you're not RPing unless you speak olde english
all the time? Nevermind the fact that none of the NPCs talk like that
and there's no indication that the dialect even exists on the
world.... And you don't have to be "formal" to be RP, either. Sheesh.
I hate that crap. RP nazis that give the rest of us bad names...
