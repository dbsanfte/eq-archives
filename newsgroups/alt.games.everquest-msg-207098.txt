Glad you made it, the first time is by far the best.

That is such a classic comment on how most people value gifts from
strangers (or institutions IRL).  I'm a firm believer in charity,
but the most effective charity will always be programs like Habitat
for Humanity that require the recipient to make a substantial
personal investment before the reward is realized.  I'll never stop
being amazed at people's ability to discount something's value to
nothing if it didn't cost them anything to acquire, regardless of
how difficult it might be to replace.
