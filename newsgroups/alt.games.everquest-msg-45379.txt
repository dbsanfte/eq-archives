Exactly, but only ever 45 minutes.
You thought the same exact thing that I did initially but think of it
this way:

You are on the spires in south ro and the box comes up (at the 45
minute point) and  you go to the auction zone or wherever. Now, you
figure "oooh I'll just take the shortcut to this other zone now" sure,
problem is, you have to wait 45 minutes ;) 

Add it up and taking the boat even if its to velious or kunark is
faster.
