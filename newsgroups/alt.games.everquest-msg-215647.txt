Well I have to agree with you there, too, I've played several female characters, one
was my first character over 30 in fact, my "main" for at least 6 months back a couple
years ago.  Mostly I've stuck with males instead, but all in all its all personal
preference and no biggie; playing a female doesn't make me a bitch any more than
playing a troll gives me the ability to regenerate damage rapidly when wounded... and
given that I make swords for a living IRL, I could sure use that ability!
