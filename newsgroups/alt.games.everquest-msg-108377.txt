    This group would make use of a necromancer nicely. Someone pulls, pet
tanks (with cleric watching health) while mob is
Tashed/Scented/Darknessed/DoT'ed, and then fear kite with the rogue piling
on the backstabs. If you're pulling undead, the cleric can be fearing,
otherwise it falls on the necromancer or the enchanter. This group would be
able to play with all sorts of strategies, given the sheer number of buffs
and DoTs it has available.

    Outdoors, this shouldn't be much of a problem. If a pet breaks a mez,
have the necro fear the add, then back off the pet. The big problem with
pets on the wrong mob is that you have trouble getting them off the mob -
Fear does that nicely. The group you posted also wouldn't have problems
getting a pet off an add, what with all the stuns available to them.

    That's just a stupid cleric, then, not a limitation of the necromancer
class.

    At lower levels I look at the necromancer as a plate tank replacement.
Most of their services revolve around damage mitigation via fear kiting.
They also have a pet to soak damage, some damage dealing with DoTs, the odd
Tap/nuke, pet, and resist debuff, and can mana transfer, heal and mez in
emergencies. That's a lot of functionality beyond "can u deal damage?"

    Wizards suffer in groups not tailored to their abilities because they
lack utility. That is not the case with the necromancer.

    That's not all you can do, though, is it? You can also (at the level of
the enchanter in the OP's group) Tash, nuke, DoT, fear, and cast some
non-standard buffs like Berserker Strength and your AC line. Casting any of
those increases your worth to the party.

> Necros tend to buff their own pet

    Heh. Not if they're grouped with a shaman, an enchanter, and a cleric
they aren't. Well, they might take over Spirit Armor from the cleric
depending on how the workload is distributed. The necro pet buff at that
level is a miserable spell that doesn't last long and has a long refill
time - I'm sure they'd love to clear that spell slot for something more
useful.

    No, it means that you now have mana to use in other ways. Drop a nuke on
the odd mob, or Berserker Strength the main tank just before the pull comes
in to save the cleric a bit of mana. Or keep it in reserve in case of adds.
This line of thinking is almost as silly as a cleric saying "I hate
enchanters, their slows and mezzes mean I don't heal as much".
