Fair enough... It's just that I think that it wouldn't be an altogether 
bad thing to start opening up old keyed content (Sebilis, HS, VP, VT, 
what-have-you) as new expansions come out. This way those players at the 
Uber end of the bell curve who can get keys enjoy all the content 
undisturbed by the hoi-polloi for a year or so, and afterwards players 
who solo or are members of small, innefectual guilds can also have a 
shot at some nice loot.

In fact, if this was the default policy, then *more* new dungeons could 
be keyed, thus preserving even more content for Uber players early on.
