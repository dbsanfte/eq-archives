Granted, dead is dead, but consider the lengths the person in each 
example goes to - the proximity to the actual "wet work" they must 
endure.

I would be willing to consider the possibility had I seen the photos of 
the posed dead Iraqis of which you speak. You've mentioned them several 
times, yet they've not been part of any of the coverage I've seen. I 
guess I can't say that it didn't happen, but if it did, then yes, I might 
feel a little differently about the distinction I've been trying to make.
