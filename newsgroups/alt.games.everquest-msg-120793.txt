I don't know where ' respect ' entered the picture here. We were 
discussing empathy and compassion. Do you not understand that
people who commit suicide are not thinking rationally [ with some
exceptions ] and are deserving of compassion and not deserving
of contempt and derision. Some people here have said the most 
ignorant, vile things with respect to guy who killed himself. That 
is what brought me into this, are you justifying those remarks ?

As for the mother, I don't, you don't and no one but_she_ knows
her motives. We all can speculate and surmise until the cows come
home, but none of us have a monopoly on the truth.

Absolutely, and I would. Do you think you would be undeserving of
compassion given the psychological state you would have had to be 
in, in order to chop off your own hand ?  On the other hand, if you
were juggling knives, fully aware of the risk of cutting off your hand,
elected to juggle them anyway, and cut off your hand, my feeling
would shift from compassion to one of, " What a dork ". 

>I save my compassion for those that are not victims of their own
>stupidity.

People who commit suicide are not victims of their own stupidity. 
They are victims of an irrational mind and are fully deserving of
your compassion and realization that, " There but the grace of 
[ God, fate, genetics, circumstances etc  ] go you or me. "

>I never set myself up as a role model. I merely expressed my opinion.

I was being a smart ass.


>We are all free agents and responsible for our own actions. For any
>action (or inaction) there are consequences. 

No we are not equal in that respect. Some individuals are simply not 
capable of making reasoned rational decisions. We are all one step 
away from a myriad of mental disorders which could jump up and bite
our bum now, when we are relatively young, or later on in life. In
addition, thousands of kids are raised in an environment which during 
their formative years put the boots to them psychologically and often 
manifests itself later in life in irrational actions. Instead of dismissing
those people and thinking they're goofs not worthy of our respect or 
compassion, we should all be thanking our lucky stars for so far, being
' normal '.

All of those activities you mention have had lawsuits, scandals, etc but 
I've yet to hear anyone take it personally as if it reflects upon themselves.
Even situations in football where the fans have actually been the problem,
no one has applied their behavior as being representative of all fans.

And neither does this silly little law suit which is going nowhere IMO,
reflect or affect the EQ player base. My point is I think you giving the
suit much more importance than it really has. The story was publicized
many months ago and died a swift death. The attempt to revive it has
already fallen flat.


>I am outraged that this woman is stupid enough to blame a game for her
>sons ulitmate end. 

But you fail to entertain the possibility that perhaps she _really_ believes
it was responsible. Ignore for the moment whether her belief is right
or wrong. Why do you find it so hard to concede the _possibility_ that 
she_might_be sincere in her belief ?

I am outraged that she did nothing to stop him,
>despite all of the warning signs. 

You don't know that she did _nothing_. All you know is what has been 
reported, and you can bet your boots, much of the negative accounts
has been Verant generated. That is standard operating procedure.
If this ever does go to trial, [ which I don't believe will ever happen ] 
I'd bet the farm we all will get a different picture.


I am outraged that there is a Lawyer
>willing to take her suit, 

..come on...if that outraged you, you'd never stop being outraged.
You'd be healthier getting sick over it like me. Every day spawns 
another 100 bs suits.

and I am outraged that major media outlets
>waste time and bandwidth reporting it. 

They are scum. They sell soap. That's all they do. Most shows are
nothing more than infomercials. Star Wars comes out, and *cough*
serious newswoman Connie Chung *cough* does an hour on CNN
interviewing the ack'tors ? Bought and paid for bullshit disguised
as ' news '.

I express this outrage on
>behalf of myself. I only pointed out the size and existance of the
>community to show how small and insignificant this woman and her son
>are.

Yes, but haven't you heard, size isn't everything ? I'm not saying your 
feelings aren't real, I'm just saying I believe we should be more 
compassionate and less judgmental, especially in light of the fact 
that we don't _know_what went down. Don't you find it a wee bit 
contradictory, that you express outrage on behalf of the EQ community
for being judged prematurely solely on the basis of this woman's suit,
yet are ready to judge her motives and the relevance of her claims based 
solely on media reports without benefit of a full and public hearing which
would occur in court ? 


>>You get bent out of shape because of some perceived misconception

>No I get bent out of shape when people think empathy and compassion

OK, let me ask you another question then. Let's say you felt compassion 
for every single fool who screwed up his or her life. How would that make 
you less of a person ? Or are you willing to consider you might actually be
a better person for it ? Did you feel disdain for Mother Theresa and think she 
was a chump, or did you admire her compassion for all people and purity of 
spirit ? When reading about Dr. Albert Schweitzer and his Reverence for 
Life philosophy, did you think, " What a sucker ", or did you reflect upon 
the connection we all share as living creatures on this planet, and while some
are richer / poorer, smarter / dumber, more or less functional, all will end
up as food for the worms, and to not try to be as generous as possible towards
all people would be somewhat of a wasted kick at the can ?
