That's a peculiar opinion to hold, considering that homosexual behaviour 
in animals is well documented, and pretty much (at least in mammals and 
birds) as common as it is amongst humans.

Perhaps the "primary", but primary doesn't mean only, and certainly 
doesn't mean most important, now that a sizeable percentage of the

Certainly religion has nothing to do with morality. And certainly, one's 
choice of sexual orifice has nothing to do with morality either. If you 
think it does, I'm afraid you'll have to do a better job of explaining 
why.
