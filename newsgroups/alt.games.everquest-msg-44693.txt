Make a level 1 Erudite Enchanter, give him the money, start from scratch.
(Might not be the best race/class combo, but it's pretty close.)
If you don't want to do that, well, make a mule with high charisma to do
your purchasing and selling, try to use a character that can go into
Freeport, where you can find just about everything you could need for
smithing.

If you don't want to do that, or even if you do, go check out
www.eqtraders.com, it is back online, just checked.

For learning you want high INT, which you, as a Troll, do not have.  For
successfully making items, you want a high STR or WIS, you have that.  For
buying/selling, you really want a high Charisma, as a Troll, well, you know
about that.  The Erudite Enchanter gives you great stats for learning most
trade skills.  If you really must learn with your Troll, then at least make
the mule for your dealings with merchants, it will make a big difference in
the long run.  Personally, I did it with my stupid barbarian shaman, he at
least has the STR/WIS, going for him.  It was expensive, I did not create a
mule.  I am currently at 142 or so in smithing.  Did I mention it is
expensive?  What you have left is not enough to really get your smithing
going.  How high are you looking to get it?  Banded? Fine Steel?  Getting to
the point of making Banded is not too bad, going much beyond that gets very
expensive.  You should know that you will not be making money with smithing.
