I stayed at the orcs in Misty (slow as it was) until I hit 14 and got
Expulse Summoned, then I did my mid-teens in Lavastorm hunting sprites and
such.  The summoned line spells works well on those critters.  Set up shop
near the Najena zone and wear 'em out.

Then, much as I hate to admit it, it was off to the Lake of Ill Manners for
Sarnaks and Gobs.

Hope this helps!
