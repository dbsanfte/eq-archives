One of the best xp groups I have been in in DL we had a chanter pulling for
us.  We went nonstop, always had at least one mob standing around waiting
his turn to be killed.  But, I have to admit, I was kind of dubious of the
idea when the enchanter first proposed it, being as enchanter just don't
start with all that many hp.  Unfortunately, I have not grouped with any
other enchanters that had the inclination to do that.
