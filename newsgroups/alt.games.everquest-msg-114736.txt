The Bazaar is a HUGE problem...or will become one.

If and when they implement the player-merchant system, there will be
2-3 times more people crowding into the zone. 10fps now will be 1fps
then.

That whole zone needs to be rewritten with a lower polygon count. (or
retextured with smaller texture files from old world zones that are
less complex)
