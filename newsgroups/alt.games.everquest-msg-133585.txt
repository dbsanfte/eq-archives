}I am an iskar monk trying to get my new shackle.  I need to talk to The
}Great Ompwomp, but his little ogre standing behind him hates me.  I am feign
}deathed my way up to summoning the dancing skeleton, but he refuses to give
}me the hand.  Is this quest broken?  I have died 5 times now trying to get
}this to work.  I am playing on the FV server, so just leveling until the
}ogres are green to me does not work out because of other quests I am trying
}to do.  Any help would be greatly appreaciated.  Thanks!

(1) get to a fair distance from Oowomp, headed away from the other ogres.
(2) plink him wth a throwing star or something.
(3) pull him a bit further away and FD.
(4) hopefully you can now get his attention and do the quest without 
    interference before he decides to walk back to his spawn point.
(5) get him to summon the skelly.
(6) tell the skelly "I will return the fist".
(7) party.
