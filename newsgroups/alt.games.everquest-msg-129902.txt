You got it.

To the original poster, Verant _have_ announced this policy, and it reads
as follows:

"Linkdeath is caused by client or network issues that will exist well after
release and can not be compensated for by programming.  Linkdeath can never
be proven and can actually be used by players to purposely avoid dire
consequences of their actions in the game.  Consequently, dying while
linkdead is not considred to be death by a bug, with the one current
exception of players going linkdead on boats and drowning in the ocean".

Resurrections are only given to verified bug deathsi, by Guides or GMs.

Guides and GMs will respond to your petition regardless and let you know
the score, and usually verify that your corpse is still reachable (as
it could have ended up halfway across the zone post-LD).  

Kind regards,

Tris.
