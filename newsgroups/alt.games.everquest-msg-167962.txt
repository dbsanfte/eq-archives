Hi all,

Just getting back into EQ and was noticing a change in the in-game HUD
design... I have seen some screen shots that actually list the name of the
spells next to the spell icons, as well as a number next to your name and
the other names in your group denoting the amount of life each has
remaining. I can't seem to figure out how to make my screen look that way,
and would like to... any help would be appreciated.
