Well, the +STA items will stil help on Max HP, but the changes will
mostly be to the Stamina bar, which honestly wasn't used that much,
especially once you got it over 100.

Why else would you need STA maxed aside from HP anyways?

It sounds like the Invigorate line of spells will be worthless now, as
they'll only add in +END buffs, not END regen items along the lines of
a KEI.  As they're going to award the buffs in the aspect of balance,
I'd watch for Paladins or SK's to possibly get them to offset their
loss in desirability once the patch comes into effect.

Just my 2cp, of course.
