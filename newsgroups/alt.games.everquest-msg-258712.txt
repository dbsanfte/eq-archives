The idea is quite good. But PoK books are out since it's not included in
Classic or Kunark.
You can find another NPC in Highpass Hold but it's nearly impossible to
get to as a lvl7 warrior.

Don't dismiss the newbie quests. They are quite nice! :)
To find the npc for it just run around the house where you started and
hail everyone. Usually it's a grandmaster of your class.
That aside I would recommend switching to druid or necromancer too. It's
damn hard to get a foot on the ground as a starting warrior. :/
Unless you play on firiona vie there is no reason not to keep your
warrior and just experiment with other classes.
