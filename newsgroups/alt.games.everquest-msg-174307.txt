I have a lvl 40 wiz on the Veeshan I've heard Wizards can quad kite and I
don't see how. With KEI I can solo 2 DB mobs, or 1 even mob before my Mana
runs out. So how is it possible to take on 4? Any advice/tips on how to do
this and where to get exp at 40 besides DL which I am so tired of would be
greatly appreciated Feel free to email me at Saul_soultaker@hotmail.com
