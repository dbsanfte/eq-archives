I've been on the cleric end of that game, I know how its run.

You can't get 8 kills in a row by using melee and a smaller nuke than 
the big boy on the block by using atone.

You sure can't get it when the kill shot is a 2k nuke from the mage.

You -can- arrange to get it 50% of the time, perhaps 100% of the time if 
the mage is (as we often do) throwing his nukes in early and then 
sitting.  (just atone after he's done cast your nukes after you atone, 
and rely on warrior plus your nukes to outdamage mage pet plus chanter 
pet plus cleric melee and pet)

But when the mage wakes up and says "hey, I'm being KS'd, whats up with 
that?" and starts actively trying, I don't think you can hope to hit it 
100% of the time.  Part of why is that cleric nukes take time to cast, 
and you have to cycle after the atone.

But the main part of why is that you simply don't have the burst damage 
to compete, not when its just you and a warrior.

You and a wizard, sure, time it so atone lands just before wizard hits 
the big gun, you'll blow everyone out of the water 100% of the time.

But a warrior?  And a cleric nuke?

I just don't see it happening.  Sometimes the mage nuke is going to land 
after the atone.  And when the mage nuke gets the kill (as it did at 
least once), then no way; you've thrown away all the warrior damage save 
the last few seconds worth.
