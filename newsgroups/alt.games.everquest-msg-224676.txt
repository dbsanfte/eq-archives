Solo does not require the most strategy, it requires the least.  This is 
because you always know exactly what skills and abilities you have to 
work with; with a group you have far more of those skills and abilities, 
leaving you a lot more choices.  And grouping tends not to be with a 
static group, but rather with different combinations of people with 
different classes, plus different gear and personal skills and preferences.

Soloing is perhaps the most difficult way to play, depending on your 
class.  My cleric soloed half of each level from 35 to 61, and it was 
indeed rough going.  But my bard soloed 90% of each level from 1 to 57, 
and I don't think I'd ever call what he was doing particularly 
difficult.  My shaman soloed 80% of each level from 1 to 52, and again, 
difficulty was only as high as he wanted it to be; he -could- find 
easily single pulled mobs and play a no difficulty game, it was only 
because he wanted more variety and challenge that he'd get into places 
where multiple mobs were dividing his attention that I'd say he did some 
difficult things.

For my mage, soloing is either nearly impossible, or easy as falling off 
a log; pick on single blue targets... heck even white or yellow targets, 
and I can solo anything.  But give me even a single green add and I'm 
often left running back to recover my body; if I can't get the mob off 
me and onto my pet -quick- then I can't nuke, can't keep my pet alive, 
and frankly I can't stand up to the beating even if my pet -can- solo 
his target.  With SOW I was able to do much better, but thats not really 
solo because I can't SOW myself, unless you count buying the bottle. 
Now that I have run 2 (and working hard on run 3) this may change 
dramatically... I'll be able to kill two or three easy blues at a time, 
as long as my pet can take them without any help from me as I run the 
adds around him waiting.

Several times now I've been in LDoN groups which ended after success due 
to people having other committments, and I've stayed behind and soloed 
quite happily thru several mobs.  If I had some way of splitting or 
mezzing, I don't see what would stop me from staying the entire half 
hour each time (invariably after three or four mobs I manage to pull two 
or three at a time, and gate out while my pet nobly takes the bullet for me)

The only reason you need a group for LDoN (assuming you are a serious 
solo class, which mage isn't quite) is if you want to actually succede 
on a mission.  And I'm not sure bards can't do that solo, naked.

Not that I disagree with most of your post, just picking a nit
