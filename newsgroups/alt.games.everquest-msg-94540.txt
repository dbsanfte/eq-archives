OK, for exploring and SEEING zones, do a bard.  they have awesome
abilities in this matter and can do a whole hell of a lot.  Advantage
to a bard is that a bard can almost always get a group after lvl 30
and is hands down the most powerful overall class.  Necro, druid can't
get a group (usually) and a monk, though he can get out of agro by FD,
honestly can't solo well.  (I've played all of these classes to 50th
or higher)

XP for druids is now much better than Necro because necro's now take a
huge XP hit  when their pet outdamages them, which is most of the
time.

For moving around and seeing druid or wizard spires, pick a druid or
wizard (obviously) but I don't think that's really what you want to
do.

Racially, be a human and agnostic.  you can go into most any city
(ogres, iksar and troll excepted)
