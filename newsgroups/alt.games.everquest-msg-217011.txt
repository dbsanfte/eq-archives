For a while they had hp updates in your target window being very
accurate but lately I've been noticing especially in ch chain fights
that while the MT's hp bar shows full on my target window I still end up
healing for 2-3k sometimes. It could be because we're doing fights at
the extreme range of ch, including extended range items, which I hadn't
done much of previously though.

Getting hit with Xegony ae sure makes me wish I had a 20% range item
instead of just 10% though.
