    Yeah, the new ones are peachy. Let's see, we have Dalnir's - the zone
where one coerced gnome turns all the other mobs into nightmares to kill,
with claustrophobic tunnels and lots of caster mobs. At least you don't need
a snarer, since the mobs path into the wall at zone and stay there. City of
Mist is nice, since you can exploit the torch near zone-in, but don't cast
on those ghost goos or you'll train the entire zone on you! And those other
three you listed, and, well, that's it for the OT-DL level dungeons in
Kunark.

    What do you have in Velious? Crystal Caverns, a solid zone if
inconveniently placed, and ToFS, an internally keyed dungeon not well suited
to being a pickup zone (how do solo melees get out/get to groups?) And
that's it.

    What do you have on Luclin? Hmm, what DO you have on Luclin in that
level range that isn't outdoors? I honestly can't think of anything,
although Echo Caverns might qualify (forget the level range on the
critters).

    And we agreed that the pre-Kunark dungeons stank. So what dungeons did
you want these folks to go to? CoM and CC and that's it?

    You should start listing the alternatives first. You might be surprised
how many are outdoors.

    Stop right there. Did *I* say warrior/cleric/enchanter? Hell, no! But if
you're doing a dungeon, you're gonna need the following:

-some form of reliable crowd control. Unless the dungeon has wide open areas
and few casters, Root is unacceptable for this purpose. Bard, Enchanter,
Necromancer are good classes for this. Classes that can consistently single
pull, like Monks, can replace this depending on conditions.
-some form of healing, emphasis on healers that aren't also engaged in
combat. Shaman, Cleric, Druid, and sometimes Paladin can all fill this slot.
Necromancer in a pinch.
-some sort of tank with the ability to Taunt. War/Pal/Rng/SK work well,
Nec/Mag/Bst in a pinch but you're asking for it.
-snare, to avoid train death. Druid, Ranger, Necromancer, Shadow Knight,
Wizard. Enchanter, paladin, or cleric if you trust chain-stuns, and you
shouldn't.

    Roles for every class in there, pretty basic. But if you're missing one
of those pieces, you're SOL. Maybe you can pull to zone with what you have,
but you won't be going inside.

    Ok, you tell me: without referencing a specific spot (so no "don't need
snare at Dalnir zone, n00b"), tell me how to work around those four
requirements I listed above in a dungeon.

    Real noobs have no idea what the trinity is. They just log on and want
to play. It's only us "experienced" players that seem to get a thrill out of
sitting around LFG at zone-in, or LFG over /gu while rearranging the stuff
in our bank account yet again.

    Funny, I've known more people that get burned out on being LFG for
hours. Or who can't stand how they might have a few people online, but
because they don't have classes that can fill some of those roles I
mentioned above can't go do fun things. As someone who was once part of an
all-dwarf guild, trust me on that last part.

> Its easy, and its boring, and it has little or no reward.

    The reward is fast XP. Never forget that. Earning that next set of
spells is a big incentive. I agree with the first two things, though.

    Better for what, though? Loot? Agreed, dungeon loot is better almost all
the time (as long as mudflation hasn't totally devalued what you're
camping). XP? Factor in the deaths, and the time spent LFG and it's outdoors
all the way. In a world with mudflation, which of those two factors do you
think will win out in the end?
