Hi all,

I'm still playing my bard.  I've made it to 14 and he still rocks.  With all
of the HQ bear skins and GLSs I've gotten I started up grading my armor.
I'm carrying a shiny brass shield, I like it even though I know it's not all
that uber.  I wearing a lockjaw tunic (got my STA up to 75), a split paw
hide mask and belt.  Magic and posion saves.  Legs, shoulders and hat is
still patchwork.  Boots are reenforced leather.  Gloves, neck, arms and
wrists are banded.  I was looking funny already but now I added a bronze
helm. hehe  My wife said I look like a poor flash gordon.

But, I also have a jagged band on each finger (well, just 2 fingers).  Does
anyone know what the usual price for that is?  I bought them from a vendor
for 71pp each.  Both are 5AC and 3STR.  I felt they were worth it.

Lewis
