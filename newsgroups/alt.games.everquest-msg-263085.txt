People have a right to be irritated. LoE was by and large a case of "Buy 
an EQ2 beta slot, and get a free game. (A game that isn't particularly 
interesting, and which many purchases didn't even bother to install.)

This is fine, but it signals the first time a company has effectively 
*sold* beta slots. In effect, it signals the first time video game 
players have agreed to shell out money to play a game that isn't even 
considered by the developer to be ready to release, never mind the 
critics/reviewers. A game that isn't even finish.

Its fair to somewhat cynically say that this will herald in a new era of 
software development, where they won't even start writing the code until 
they've got adeuqate buy in to justify it. 

/ranting beings
Much like new Condos in major cities. It used to be they built the condo 
and hten sold htem. Then they started selling them before they built 
them. And NOW there are condos that you have to shell out several 
thousand dollars to purchase an 'invitation to the preselling'. (ie you 
pay a few thousand bucks for the priviledge of being allowed to buy a 
unit when they start preselling them... 

Essentially you are putting a deposit down on an artists conception of 
what the building will look like, and a few brochures about the various 
brands etc that they will be using for the plumbing fixutures, 
carpeting, etc.

Then when they actually get going (ie they have sold enough of these 
'invitations') you are invited to a show unit that will look 'more or 
less' what the end product will be like inside, and your 'predeposit' 
entitles you to at that point buy a unit (still in advance of them 
lifting a single shovel of dirt).

Worst you *can't* wait until the building is built and then buy a unit, 
becuase they won't build it until 70% of the units are sold... and whats 
left are usually the itty bitty units right next to the elevator or have 
some retarded floor plan... unless you buy from someone who got in at 
the pre-selling invitational ... for an extra 20k or more.

(Granted I'm just bitter... I went to a 'grand opening' to a condo pre-
selling recently, and the place was 75% pre-sold when it opened; all 
that was left were one bedrooms...I had to sit in an outside queue for a 
couple hours while they brought people in a couple at a time... and they 
wouldn't tell anyone anything about what was available until you got 
inside (and hell... given that it was the grand opening to the PRE-
selling... we assumed there would be a large number of units left). 
Bloody waste of time.)
/ranting ends ... maybe

This is where gaming appears to be going. First they wrote games and 
sold them. Now they are all available for 'preorder' (what is that 
anyway... an interest free loan to Sony for the development of the 
game?? And in exchange I get a copy the same day everyone else does 
except I'm not at risk of not getting a copy and having to wait another 
day or two! God no!!! Not that!!) ... and now SOE has upped the ante... 
now you can pay to play the beta in the form of the LoE bundle. Buy 
purchasing the LoE bundle for an EQ2 slot you legitimize the practice, 
and soon it will be buy a 30.00 EQ3 tshirt and get into the EQ3 beta... 
or buy a tshirt, mug, and a copy of EQ2 and we'll let you into an 
'exclusive' earlier phase of the same beta. And for 1000 and your first 
born you can see the alpha and have an npc named after you. =)
