I happily porcupined it up into the low 20s, at which point the mobs
started hitting hard enough that "come hit me" root wasn't cutting
the mustard.  I still do it to max out defense (136 at level 30, gotta
work on it a bit more) but the mobs I'm fighting will do 4 bubs of
damage to me while taking less than one themselves from my
Dark Ember (offense and 1hb maxed) and DS combo (14 points
per blow at level 30)

Yes Treeform means I get the HP back just as quickly as I get mana
back, but as a tactic its far from effective at producing kills.

My AC is 505, hp somewhere in the 600s (less than what I had
at level 20, actually, been trading in mana/hp gear for WIS gear.
Maybe thats not what you meant by good armor class cheap stuff...
