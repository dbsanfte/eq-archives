: I always wonder what kind of morons think that people would actually
: join/buy/whatever from someone who has so obviously misrepresented
: themselves--same with email bullshit. All I can figure is that whoever
: comes up with the marketing strategy has a mental age of about ten.

I always enjoy seeing "Missed you last night", "You blocked my IMs"
(particularly funny as I never IM and never run any IM programs), "About our
conversation", etc.  I know before I even bother to open them that they are
trash.  Now, it seems, the latest way to get around blocking is misspelling
words in headers and in the body (makes me feel real good about the idea of
doing business with someone who can't even spell what they are selling).
