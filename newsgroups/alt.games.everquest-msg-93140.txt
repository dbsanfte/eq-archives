I wouldn't care if my cap was 300, you still wouldn't see me in the front
lines fighting mobs.  Unless of course they also gave us double attack, dual

watching the battle...  if I *really* get bored with that, I play my rouge.

My answer - it wouldn't matter, we would still be butchered on the front
lines even w/our precious plate armor.
