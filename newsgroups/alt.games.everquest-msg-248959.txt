Congratulations! Fly is one of the best powers in the game, not only because
of its obvious and tremendous utility, but it's also the most fun power.
Breathy and I have spent hours flying around looking at the city, climbing
to the highest rooftops and exploring. Your flight speed will increase every
level but at some point it won't hurt to drop one of those flight speed
enhancers in there since greater flight speed is not only more fun, it also
= less endurance cost.
