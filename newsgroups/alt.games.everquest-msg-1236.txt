I don't ever symbol anyone with Marzin other than the chanter except
for very difficult breaks.  It is idiotic.  Sometimes for a pulling
monk if he is likely to get hard by wizards.

I mean, why?

The jaspar symbol I will keep on myself and others, if I have mana for
it.

I don't agree about this.  I have never seen a planes raid that didn't
drop some REALLY nice gems, e.g. diamond, blue diamond, etc - 50 level
rare gems.  I always get reimbursed cash, though, for symbols.


 The cleric is still EXPECTED to buff the entire

Again, IMHO this is poor use of mana, not to metion pp.  I will always
symbol (Marzin) an enchanter.  If I am in pull group, I'll symbol the
monk.  If I have a warrior who is the main tank and is taking
horrendous damage, I will certainly symbol him -- saves me a ton of
mana by making complete heal hit for an extra 700HP, on average, every
time I cast it.

Well, you are clearly a guy who is a pleasure to play with, and you
will get the benefit of your good character by enjoying the game.  I am
the other way, I have never charged for a rez.  If I can do it, it's
free.  And at level 57, I still have the devotion of one of the best
enchanters on my server, since when he was in his 30's I would
repeatedly run to the bedroom of LGuk to rez him and his friends for
free.

And also, the people I play with are happy to reiumburse me for
reagents.
