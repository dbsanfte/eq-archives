Yes.

My characters that do this keep a stack each of food and drink in
two top level inventory slots.  I regularly right click (have the
slots hotkeyed for ease of access) both, usually getting the "...
you will explode!" message, to make sure that I am at or near my
limit in case events distract me.  SOE has stated that you do not
get full benefit from forcefeeding in this fashion, various posters
here have stated that you get half credit.  My Druid and Ranger
characters just use foraged stuff, my non-foragers use Iron Rations
(Hearty meal, iirc) and Water, because they are readily purchasable
almost anywhere and it keeps stacking simple (the expense is too
small to notice).

Only difference I have heard claimed is that Vah Shir consume more
than others.  Beyond that, there are definitely some zones where you
consume more drink (NRo, SRo, Oasis for sure), and there's an AA to
reduce consumption.  Don't know if there are food/drink consumption
differences for any other zones.

Nope.  And if you don't have an open slot that's several more clicks
to eat/drink (open bag, pick up stack, put stack in slot, right click
[repeat until explode messsage], put bag back in slot, put stack back
in bag, close bag), which is why I don't fill my inventory with bags
anymore.  The benefits from the food/drink are quite nice, well worth
not having as many inventory slots available to carry junk, to me at
least.
