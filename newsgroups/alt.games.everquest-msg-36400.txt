Unless there is an enchanter in the group where druid roots will break mez, he
should definitely have it in.   Crowd control is the responsibility of the
casters.  All of them.  Arguments along the lines of "You were supposed to
root it!"  "I would have, but the tank was down to 1 bubble of life and I had
to heal now!" help nobody.

Spirit of Cheetah and Gate are both spells that really say you don't trust the
group.  Basicly you're sacraficing almost 1/4 of your combat effectiveness to
spells that can only save your own hide.  At the very least Gate should be
Evac.
