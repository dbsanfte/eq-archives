Yeah, that's what I thought, but some folks think differently.  We did
take a mage down two yellow bubbles exploring ToV, with level 56
rezzes.  Of course since our necro guildleader was running the mage,
necro, and cleric, it's possible that he wasn't quite as efficient as
he could have been.

Exactly, but I really couldn't think of other reasons to need to use
ShowEQ.  I don't think it's the spawn points as much as the levels,
hitpoints, and resists that you want to find out.  Maybe I would use
it for groundspawn, but I can't think of any I need that I don'
already have.
