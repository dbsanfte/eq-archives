Aye  :)  There was a player in our guild who needed that ring for his
Epic, and we did the whole thing with 3 of us - a 70 Beastlord (me) a
70 Druid and the Shaman who was about 50 to 53 I think.

We could have borrowed a Rogue (there's often a Rogue sitting there
practicing Lockpick), but we just used Shrink to get through the gap
in the door.

If I wanted the permanent Key, I'd use a Rogue Shroud, like many do
nowadays, get behind the key vendor using sneak/hide and buy the key
that way.  Saves time, anyway  :)
