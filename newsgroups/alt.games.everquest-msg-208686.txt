While it's not the best-run MMORPG out there, take a look at Ragnarok
Online (http://enweb.ragnarok.co.kr/r_main.htm). Their software and
all new content, including "expansions", is completely free. It's
about $12 a month to play ($15-ish if you use the ECheck, PayPal, or
other alternative to credit cards).

Problem being, Gravity has a lot of flaws, mostly stemming from being
very new to doing business outside of Korea. They have set up an
American office for customer service for International RO (iRO), but
it's still showing its youth very much.

It's an amusing game, though. I played during the last open beta phase
and even for a month after it went live (Someone off a fansite
actually paid for a month for me...). Sure, it's not for the serious
power gamer, though. But if you're looking for something that's just
simple fun, that's got it.

There are free, private servers out there, but they're illegally run
and hard to find...
