There are places where it is useful.  It will cause all the mobs hit by it 
to aggro on you unless someone else has a fair amount of hate built up, 
but, that is one of it's big benefits too.  It gets some of them slowed, 
some will resist usually, and, it pulls the hoarde to you.  Others have 
already mentioned some of the places it is handy, which matches my 
experiences.  I have used it in a few other similar situations, but, it is 
not used often.
