You do have a point there. Maybe they can manage to pull it off without 
leaving you feeling like you're missing something

Second 'm', actually. ;) Yes, I do wonder if that will create much of a 
feeling of detachment. Time will tell.

Ok. Now we're getting into "load of crap" territory. Preventing 
killstealing can in no way be described as a bad thing on a PvE server, 
period. There's no debating that point.

Gutless because we'd like to see the ignorant, selfish, childish behavior 
addressed? Gimme a break. Griefing is bad. The fact that people would 
like to see it greatly reduced doesn't mean they don't want to play with 
others. It means they don't want to play with assholes.

Does the term "carebear" refer to a game that discourages jerk-off 
behavior? Cool. Sign me up.
