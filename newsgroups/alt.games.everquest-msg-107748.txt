The canned response indicates nothing more than he's using a so-called
canned response. Let them explain the problem again for more details.
"I'm stuck under the world and need out" doesn't tell the guide HOW
they got stuck under the world, which is relevant information.

Generally, this is the norm for ALL tech support to use a "canned
greeting". Even for tech support guys who get a summary of the problem
as soon as the call comes in...
