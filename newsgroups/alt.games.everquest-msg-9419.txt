You are far, far more patient than I am, then.

Not only do I not care to read what some people post, I really don't
care to spend the time that getting into a flame war with any of them
would entail. Easiest for me to just KF them. Save me time, saves the
group bandwidth. And I doubt any of them has information to offer that
I couldn't find elsewhere, should I choose to look for it.
