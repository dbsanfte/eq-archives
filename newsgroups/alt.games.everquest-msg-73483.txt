ICS?  I wouldn't think so...EQ doesn't take that much bandwidth to play,
I've heard of many people using ICS to share a phone line without too much
trouble.

*shrug* I'm at a loss though I'm running into similar problems occasionally
on one of my computers.  It certainly couldn't hurt to remove your firewall
for a few days to see if that clears up the problem.  You didn't mention if
you meant a software or hardware firewall...when you said it I assumed you
meant ZoneAlarm or something similar.  I'm using that and have no problem on
two of my computers.  If you mean a hardware firewall that's kinda over my
head though I would think that if you're able to connect at all then it
SHOULDN'T be a problem once you get in (that goes for software firewall as
well).

And add that RAM...it shouldn't make a difference either but who the hell
knows these days? :)  EQ is SOOOO screwed up right now.
