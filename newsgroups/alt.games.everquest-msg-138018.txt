wow...that's really interesting. Did you hear enough to garner any
information on what may cause these varying levels of hormones in the
mother's body?  (don't get me wrong...I fully understand fluctuating
hormones in women's bodies).  Did the time frame during the pregnancy have
any impact as well?

OK...I realize that you said you were kinda sorta listening from another
room, so you probly won't be able to answer those questions.  What
show/channel was it?  My curiosity has been piqued.
