Not sure exactly, a couple months back more or less.

In Great Divide, go to the far south end of the stream, there's a little 
tiny castle sitting in the water there, click on it and you are in. 
Bring a gate method, as far as I have been able to discern there's no 
way out except by tapping on some trees just north of the zone in and 
finding the one that dumps you in the water in the middle of Cobalt 
Scar, a long walk home.

Fun zone though, at least so far, and much better looking than POD or POI.

Splendid
