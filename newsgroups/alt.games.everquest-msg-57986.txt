Have you installed any virus-scanning utilities?  If so, disable them
and see if that helps.  I have seen memory-resident virus scanners
mess up more systems than I can count.  The symptoms often involve
slowing the system, or certain activities, to a crawl.

If nothing else, try going to the Task Manager (Ctrl-Alt-Del), and
nuking EVERYTHING except for "Explorer".  Then try your games.
If that solves the stuttering, then the culprit is one of your
memory-resident programs.  That's why these sorts of problems can
just "suddenly" arise -- it depends on when you installed a piece
of software that decided it needed a permanently running memory-resident
portion.

95% of the memory-resident crap can be dumped with no ill effects
whatsoever, and often give noticeable performance boosts.
