What would you expect?

All things considered having someone's alts in your guild is never a 
great thing. You will always be 2nd fiddle to the main guild. I'd have a 
policy of no-alts without mains. Its not strictly enforceable, and it 
won't help you with your problem, because the guy is still going to know 
his friends from your guild, who he will want to take with them, but at 
least you would have set the expectation is that *while* you are in 
*this* guild you are with *us*.

I'd just ignore it as inevitable. People are usually more loyal to their 
freinds than to their guilds (and should be). If a former member is 
recruiting their friends out of your guild there is nothing you can or 
really should do to prevent it.

Its pretty takky to recruit members from other guilds in general, but 
theres not much the 'victimized' guild can do about it, and if the 
people are going to leave, then they're going to leave. Adding policies 
to try and keep them isn't going to have a positive effect on anybody.
