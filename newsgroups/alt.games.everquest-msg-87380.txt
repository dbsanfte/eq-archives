I am an admitted impatient-turbo-clicker when I tradeskill.  I set up in 
the most efficient manner to get the most tries in x amount of time.  I set 
up the containers in the perfect place and I keep that CTRL key down while 
I click like the wind.  Impatient is an understatement.

I need to work more on brewing ( failure rate on Headys are incredible 
when they are trivial for some reason ) and I haven't started smithing.  
The word "bits" already gives me chills, and I haven't even made one.
