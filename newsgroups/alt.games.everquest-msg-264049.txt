Granted. But the thing I is I liked to listen to his story. Just sit
there and let him talk. Was quite fun.

I don't buy that. ;) Neither dark elfs nor erudites would allow to be
packed away in such slums. At least they would throw the trolls and
ogres out of their part of the city. May be there is a story to it. Some
hints are there when you talk to the citizens there. But I doubt I'll
ever find it out as I'm not going to buy EQ2.
