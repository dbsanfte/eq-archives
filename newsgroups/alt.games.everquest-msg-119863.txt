Actually after reading this article, I could almost argue that CNN is
pointing out how stupid she is.  Before even talking about the part of
trying to sue Sony (and then only mentioning it), they wrote allot showing
how much of a bad parent she was, how much her and the rest of the family
saw this coming, and rather than helping out, or even doing nothing, they in
some ways helped out (and did nearly nothing the rest of the time).  Like
I've said (in other posts)...she loves her fat pocketbook more than him from
what she's shown.
