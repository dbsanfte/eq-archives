I was a bit upset with the $9.95 originally until I realised what it was
about. The money is well worth it. This is NOT a game where the
company may fix some bugs here and there and provide a free update
patch for it (ie, Quake., Unreal, Rune...) This company is continually
adding on and improving the quality of game.

Its worth it. You'll be addicted. And your relationship with partner will
always
be in jeopardy. You'll say your going to bed at 12am then end up sneaking
your way in at 3am. When you do sleep, you will be plagued by dreams
that'll just make you get up and play anyways.
