Agreed. And this is something I can still remember disputing here and
not really "getting it" until much later on. When you are particularly
in your low levels, almost *ANYBODY* can take on yellows alone and have
a chance, and on a good day, sometimes even a low red if all the cards
fall your way. That starts to slowly change as you move into your teens,
twenties and further and further as you go into the thirties and
forties.
  Right now in mid forties, the majority of high greens could take me
down if I tried to solo them. Or even if I won, the downtime, even with
bandaging nearly 190, would be so bad I could go take in a movie while
recovering.
(Disclaimer: Once again, this post does NOT apply to solo druids and
necros.)
