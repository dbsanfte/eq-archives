Wrong.  Making as much money as possible by providing the service is
the goal.  Pricing does not have any natural relationship to costs,
except insofar as costs set a minimum at which it's worth the trouble
of offering the service.  Pricing has to do with the market.  If they
can get 10,000 to move at $75 and 20,000 to move at $25 guess which
option is the responsible choice?

Discouraging player transfers is unimportant unless player transfers
in some way hurt the business.

A handful of whiners on usenet hardly constitutes a dissatisfied
customer base.

But you won't play their game, because you'll consider the price they
charge to provide the level of customer service you expect outrageous.
