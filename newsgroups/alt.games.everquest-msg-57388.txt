"> I'd say any of the Karanas, LoIO if you have a thick skin.

What is it with LoiO and people being, less than civil.
I spend a great deal of time there on Karana and rarely ever had any
trouble. Sure, some kill stealing went on, but what do you expect in a zone
with such wide open areas. If you cannot be bothered to look after the mobs
you root, you shouldn't whine about it when someone takes them. Other than
that and some name calling here and there, I never noticed any ill manners.
People are always very polite, very helpfull.

I moved to AB now, so maybe it will be worse there.
