   Hmmm.  I don't have anywhere the MMO experience of the original poster,
but I gotta wonder about this business of Lineage and Lineage II having a
better community than either of the EQ's.  That certainly isn't the
reputation the enjoy, at any rate.  That said, I can sorta see where Bill
is coming from on this. There have been many times that I was in newbies
area, fighting along side others my age, who seemed intent on ignoring me. 
I think that EQ being the most success of the MMORPGs to date (in terms of
raw numbers) attract a certain mindset of players.  The ones who think that
winning = getting to the highest level asap.  Social interaction, unless it
is with someone that can PL them, just isn't a priority and in fact slows
things down.

   But...  I have seen bad behavior in other MMOs.  The only other two I
have played besides the EQs are CoH and The Sims Online.  TSO was hardly a
game, but even so I ran into griefers there.  People who were just being
annoying for the fun of it. Heck, the only stalker I've ever had to deal
with was in TSO.  CoH is the game I'm into now.  A nice bunch of folks for
the most part, but there are idiots there as well. In fact, I think that PU
groups tend to be a lower quality than the PU groups I joined or formed in
EQL, if only because the CoH crowd seems to have a much less well developed
sense of group tactics than the EQ crowd ever did.

   So, basically, I am wondering about the original premise of the starting
post.  Yes, there is bad behavior in the EQs, but there is also the same in
other MMOs, which I have seen even with my limited experience.
