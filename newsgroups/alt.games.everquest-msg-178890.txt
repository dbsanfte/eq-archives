And now for the truly bizarre!!

On the advice of a guildie, I removed all WIS items on the assumption
that if more produced negative results, then less should do the
opposite. Sure enough, at base WIS, 3 skill ups in one stack of bait.
Can't be! Added back the WIS items, and 500 bait later no skill ups and
3 more broken poles. Removed the WIS items again, 2 more skill ups
within the next stack........went out for a beer!
