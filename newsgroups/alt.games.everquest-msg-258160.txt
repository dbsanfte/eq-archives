I tried this and wound up with an 8k .ini file as opposed to the previous 
10k, so that particular difference wasn't necessarily huge. However, I 
did see slightly better graphics performance and what also seemed to be 
more image detail than before. I was running with all models and graphics  
settings maxxed before, so I'm pretty certain it isn't just a case of the 
new config. upping the graphics settings.

Good find. Thanks!
