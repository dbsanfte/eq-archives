GD fang, and yes, in order to teleport into the various Velious places, you
need to first go there, and pick up the key (fang) which is a ground spawn,
lore, nodrop (I'm pretty sure, will have to check) item.  The spawn time is
fairly quick, so if it isn't there, hang around for a few, it will respawn.
I only have one of them with my druid that went exploring, and haven't used
it yet.  Each key will allow you to tp/be tped into that Velious zone, and
any other previous zones.  You only need to keep the key from the deepest
zone you have been to, don't recall the order off hand.  I believe the
Cobalt Scar key is the last one that allows you to tp to any of the rings in
Velious.
