Glad someone else enjoys this zone, seems that when people start going
to velious it's the snow cougars that is the "entry" mob, not shure
why, tizmaks range from 25-31, cougars from 27-35 meaning lot tougher,
and as far as i know they drop no loot, while tizmaks do, maybe not
uber but the best so far is the velium great staff with my charisma of
63 i get 4pp 6gp in thurgadin for that one, not shure about them
kodiak claws since the 2 kodiaks i dropped (even con) had no loot at
all :(

Also SW of the dragon ring i can usually pick a tizmak when he wonders
by, in over 1 level i had 2 adds, once a red feral cave kodiak, that
one hurt a bit, glad i had feign death memmed :)

As a druid you can also use harmony to single pull from the cave
entrance, not shure if my screeming terror can do that so i take the
strays, but duoing with a druid is very nice, the druid snares and
DoT's and i DoT, pet was parked on the sideline :)

So at 27 i guess the tizmak warriors can be doable if not to many
resists, believe the cougars in  IC has to many HP and seems a lot
easier to get adds there. (Tizmak warriors are 25 - 27 according to
allakhazam)
