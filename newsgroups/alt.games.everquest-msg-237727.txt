You may be surprised at how many of us still use dial up *these days right on
par with tin cans and string* and understand ALL about going LD and not being
able to log in.  :)

I'll betcha they will all understand.  I live in the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan where the snow knocks out more than our cable...  LOL  I was in the
midst of an LDoN once when suddenly I was sitting in the dark.  Power was
knocked out for 4 hours because of snow.  Same thing happened to me another day
only that time it was only for 3 hours.  hehe

People understand crappy weather and they understand crappy connections.  No
worries.
