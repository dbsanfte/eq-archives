To ba fair, SOE is also notorious for broken quests, mobs that don't 
spawn anymore, quest texts mispelt, insufficient faction, (too much 
faction!!), bring me an X, where X is a rare drop of a rare spawn 
halfway around the world that in a zone that is way green to you,... etc 
etc etc...

Most EQ quests are not meant to be solved by individuals, they are 
almost required to be a collective effort, and allakhazams (et al) as a 
forum for hosting that collaboration is both inevitable and desireable.
