 Well on a lvl 29 pet I found Velium shortsword\longsword proc'd. and
on a lvl 34 the summoned: fists of ix(something) proc'd. I haven't
tried the blades since lvl 29 pet where they didn't proc. Considering
the dmg they do (150) probally wouldn't but I'll try again.

 Anyone know what lvls the pet needs to be to get them to proc, you'll
save me around 30pp. :)
