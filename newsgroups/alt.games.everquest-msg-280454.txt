Hi...

Am looking for a raiding guild with start time around 9pm PDT/PST. I am
in an awesome guild at the moment that raids at inconvenient times. Am
Anguish flagged and geared, so would prefer that, but at this point
even GoD would be fine as long as I am in a better time slot. Level 70
Rogue, 410 aa's. DPS machine. Willing of course to change servers, etc,
however just wish to get the feelers out there if a guild fits this
profile (hence why not saying where I am currently).

Thanks....
