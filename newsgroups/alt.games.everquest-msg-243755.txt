I'm sure they've thought of it. The likely conclusion is that while it
might work in the short term, in the long term it would only encourage
more people to try, in order to themselves get bought out.

Also from the sounds of it that would be a fairly expensive thing to
do. If they felt it was necessary to save a new game (say SWG or EQ2)
then it might be worth it, but I am sure they just don't see EQ as
important enough anymore.

The wording was clever but yeah it's virtually certain that was the
case. Actually I believe the later quote FROM Sony confirmed that
while they were approached, they saw no positives coming from such an
action.


A way out for future games that want to avoid this would be to draw on
the real life problem of metallic currency - it's *bulky*. Couple that
with an absense of a bank system. Suddenly you've created an economy
where its feasible to use coin for small purchases, but anything of
great value will be bartered. You would have to make sure there was no
other "stackable" item that would replace coin, but I bet you it could
be done. Just need to think outside the box.
