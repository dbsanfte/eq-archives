Heh.  It doesn't have a long recycle time (well, compared to other
disciplines) but if I was to actually try soloing something with my warrior,
the *last* thing I would do is use defensive.  Defensive will reduce the
damage the warrior takes by about 30 percent on each successful hit.   It will
also reduce his damage output by about twice that.  Defensive is not for
keeping you alive long enough to kill something.   It's for keeping you alive
long enough for the rogue you're grouped with to kill something.

Once again this is pretty funny.   I used a bloodpoint for several levels in
my 50's.   The idea that that 80 point lifetap would fire off enough to make
any significant difference is pretty laughable.
