    *cough* 24 epics *cough*

    But point taken. It's actually worse now than it should be - Ragefire is
broken so he's only popping every five days, rather than the two to three
days he should be popping at.

    Cry me a river, then go camp one of the several weapons that are better
than your epic. If you know of any other item in game with unlimited charges
of right-click 96% res, let me know. I've all but given up on getting my
epic until VI pulls their heads out of their asses on this. Glad I have a
post-epic weapon, the Wand of Casual Blessings, so I don't need the epic for
the stats.

    Green scales also can drop in Veeshan's Peak. But yeah, that two
*chances* for a drop every week, versus the two to three guaranteed drops
for a cleric when Ragefire is fixed.

    From the cleric's perspective, not a lot has changed. When it was in
Nagafen's Lair, you had to clear the giants every so often and had to clear
Nagafen if he popped. However, the average Ragefire camp was respected - if
someone was there and had been clearing giants, they got Ragefire. The
exceptions were exactly that - exceptions. Now, you need to clear nothing
but unless you're on a server like Morel Thule nobody respects a Ragefire
camp. First guild there in force gets him, barring petitioning a GM to force
a roll-off. On my server, putting Ragefire outdoors has drastically
increased the number of conflicts between guilds over the spawn.

    The mage epic is similar to the cleric epic: there's nothing that can
really replace it. The mage epic has a couple of bottlenecks - Magi P'Tasa
and Phinigel are the biggest ones. Quillmane is in theory farmable, since
the rare cycle that produces him is known, but it's not easy getting a
ranger that knows the cycle to help the mage (and pet tracking is usually
too late). What keeps it reasonable is the limited number of mages in game,
and the fact that the epic pet isn't considered essential to raiding. The
same limitations on the cleric epic don't work - there's a boatload of
clerics, all of whom pretty much need their epic to raid effectively. (I
channeled a 56 res through Rumblecrush pounding on me last night to box a
cleric, but not every cleric can do that.)

    The warrior epic is very dissimilar to the cleric epic: you don't need
it, it isn't even that hot, you just want the look and the achievement. I
don't begrudge you that, those are valid reasons to want it. But in terms of
"how good are you on raids", you don't need it - there's many other weapons
out there that are as good or better. Heck, my guild scoffs at weapons with
14/20 ratios and 500 point DoT procs, and that outclasses the warrior epic
by a fair margin. So the improvements are out there. When people ask about
the easiest epics, the first four to be named are rogue, wizard, shaman,
druid. There's a reason why cleric isn't there.
