*sigh*

Read again.  I say with 100% confidence that level 50 mobs (these
particular spawns are level 50 mobs ALWAYS) are 100% *light* blue at
62 and 100% *dark* blue at 61.  You do the math (tm).

Conjecture 1: Static spawning Level 53 (Bvellos) giant in Kael was
light blue to Monk in my group last night who I think was either level
62 or 63, he was ANON and I forgot to double check.  He did mention
that all the Senior Guards near the Arena were [now] light blue, their
levels vary though and none are as high as Bvellos AFAIK.

Conjecture 2: Deep-ish Chardok mobs were reportedly light blue at 65
on a cross server chat channel, I believe the mobs in question are
around level 55 (Miners) so that would mean that the higher you level
the less and less dark blue mobs you'll find.
