Where!?!?!?!?

I thought my favoured supplier was damn cheap at around $65 (45ukp).
Then again, with that fairly small (in real terms) price difference, I'm
happy to pay the little extra if I know I'm getting high quality memory
from a specialist memory supplier (www.crucial.com if you're
interested). Would certainly be interested to browse their other wares
though if they're flogging memory that cheap (crucial.com if you're
interested)
