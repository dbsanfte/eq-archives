Due to discussions in another thread, I set out to prove a point.

Made a wood elf ranger, put all points into strength, and loaded
him to look at stats.

STR 95
STA 75

30 HP
17 AC
22 Attack

Then I made a troll shaman and put all points into stamina.

STR 108
STA 139

26 hp
14 AC
38 Attack.

Hmm

Wood Elf Ranger, with all points into stamina
STR 70
STA 95

31 HP
17 AC
10 Attack.

Those 20 swing points made 1 point of difference in HP, and 12
points of difference in attack!

The shaman with 64 more points in STA then the str ranger had 8
-fewer- HP!

When you are next naked, please report your stamina, class, race,
and level.  I'm interested now.

Paax, 30 bear, Morel Thule
