For when it's going to be out, they have said "Summertime" for quite a
while now, such as in a VERY recent interview done by "Mobhunter" that
was linked to on just about every major EQ news site.

As I recall, they've said the new interface will do away with the
"windowed" mode, which makes the question about chaning for the
spellbook moot.

Specifics haven't been talked about much. Not an uncommon "marketting"
practice not letting the public hear much about an upgrade before it
comes out. Keeps people interested that way...
