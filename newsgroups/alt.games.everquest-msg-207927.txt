I disagree.  If you're fizzling critical spells at L10 you can fix
it with a pretty brief practice session.  Then when it happens to
you again with your new spells at L12 you can, again, fix it with
a pretty brief practice session.  At this point, assuming you're
sufficiently clever to have any hope of playing a decent Enchanter,
you realize that you have to keep your spells skills up as you
level unless you want to endure some rather miserable play sessions.
OTOH, if you PL to 24 and then discover that you can't cast any
spell higher than L4 worth a damn you are in for quite a bit of
unabted tedium to get your casting skills up to a reasonable level,
AND YOU STILL DON'T HAVE A FUCKING CLUE HOW TO PLAY AN ENCHANTER.
Oops, er, um, sorry about that.

Bullshit.  The OP was gonna PL her to 24, she wouldn't be able to rely
on casting a haste even once on a full bar of mana.

Oh yeah, I forgot, that's how everybody PLs, they stop every 15 minutes

to go to PoK and practice casting.  silly me.


Enchanter gets mez at 4, tash at 8, slow at 12, and haste at 16,
IIRC.  PLing to 24 seems like an awful idea to me when you get
your key abilities at low levels where the death penalty is small.
IMO, it makes a lot more sense to PL an Enchanter _after_ L20,
when you've already had a chance to learn something about how to
play the class.  PLing an Enchanter to 24 sounds like a recipe for
frustration, not a pathway to fun.
