> Great story, Bob.  =)  Good luck on the Efreeti.

Thanks!  We went back in tonight and I'm very happy to report that the 
Golden Efreeti Boots fit just fine! As an added bonus for the nostalgic, 
their special ability is even called "Flowing Thought".

> Give Sony credit where credit is due: they know how to make quests.

That they do. I hadn't expected to see Nektropos Castle and the mysteries of 
the Everling family topped, but Solusek's Eye continues to amaze me and 
there's much more to go. Having finally conquered Vyr'drais the Vicious 
recently, enabling our guild to get the Speak like a Dragon quest, we are 
now able to converse with Lord Nagafen and get started on Deception, the 
Prismatic event. We can hardly wait.

BTW, Kesha (L41 Swashbuckler) sends her regards and /hugs.
