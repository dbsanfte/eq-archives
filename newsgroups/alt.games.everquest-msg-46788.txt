See Lokari's site: http://www.lokari.net/everquest/tailoring.html  THE
definitive tailoring site, IMHO.

On Luclin, I would get exactly 47pp for an entire set of tailored raw silk
armor and that's 1 pp/armor class point.

I would sell entire sets only and never lacked for buyers.  Now, hm...that
was four or five months ago.  But I'll bet the rate is still the same.

It's a very profitable enterprise IF you are harvesting the silks yourself.
Hunt the Giant Spider or Large Spider.
