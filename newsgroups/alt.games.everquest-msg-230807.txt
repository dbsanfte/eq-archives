All my guild's clerics seem to keep them equipped.  I know that some of them
have looted the random cleric hammers that drop throughout the game, some of
which are probably pretty decent stat upgrades.  But even then, those random
cleric hammers rot more often than not for us, because clerics have epic,
which will *never* be replaced, and if they actually want to melee they
summon their own weapon that matches and generally exceeds any of the drops
anyway.  I rarely see any clerics wielding those dropped hammers, and any
bidding on them seems to have come to a halt completely for the past couple
months in my guild as the clerics all come to the conclusion that epic and
summoned give them all they would want.

I watched that cleric hammer off Blood rot this past Friday, and the one from
Sorrowsong two weeks before.  I don't even bother getting them for my twink
2-box.  :)

I do expect when we start seeing 150+ hp items drop that might convince a
cleric to keep epic in a bag.  Maybe.  I probably still wouldn't bother for
my twink, because the convenience of a hotkeyed rez stick for a 2-boxed
raiding cleric is just to big.  :)
