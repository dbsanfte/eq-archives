In theory, you can successfully combine an items with a trivial of >250
at skill 0.  But you'd have a horrid success rate.  And you could get a
skill increase off of it as well.  In terms of your question, if you want
to try a 240 trivial item at skill 180 and don't care about the failures,
go ahead.  You'll get skill increases and you will get some successes.
The general "rule" is to simply "make whatever gives you skill increases
(i.e., non-trivial items) that you can afford."  For most people, they want
the skill increases AND the financial benefit of successful combines
(selling the result for 1pp is still better than losing it all, right?) so they
attempt whatever is likely to successfully combine, i.e., items close to
their skill level but above it.

I'd suggest looking at www.eqtraders.com in their forums to see if there
is a generally accepted formula but I've never heard of one.
