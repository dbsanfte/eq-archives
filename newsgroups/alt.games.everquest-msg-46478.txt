OK. What great fun. Starting a new character on a new server where no
one's twinked, no one has two plat to rub together, and no one can
speak to each other.

I love it. ;-) (Call me twisted)

The dorfs in Kaladim are having great fun playing merry hell with the
elves and vice versa. No one's level 12 yet (many are close) so
running to the commons becomes a serious adventure (forget HHP or
getting over to Qyenos). No one can bind which means the trips are
extremely dangerous..

Again, great fun.

Helping two groupies find Pristine Scarab carapaces and knowing
without doubt that the resulting breastplates are, at least for now,
probably the finest armor being worn on all of Norrath is also great
fun.

So now to the point. I'm now a 9th pally. I -really- want to go wisp
hunting as that'll produce the best plat+exp for my level. The trick
is: No magic weapons. Getting a magic weapon is HARD to do on a
seriously untwinked, no-one-can-bind and no-one-can-teleport server
where the highest level characters are just now hitting their 10th and
11th seasons. To top it off, the only quests I know of that are
do-able by my level require a trip of no less than two continents, an
ocean, and an unpredictable fight at the end of it. (With trips
through Kithicor Woods and High Hold Pass thrown in for good measure..
the BloodForge Hammer quest) I can strip naked and make the run, but
HHP alone would probably be the end of me because I can guarantee you
that at these levels, NO ONE is fighting in HHP yet. SOWs aren't
available... those that can cast invis on me don't speak my language
so I can't team up for the run. Swimming to the Teleport room and
tangling with dragons and raptors in Timorous Deep just for the
short-cut to Erudin is also out of the question.

Ideas?

Well I can maybe get a summoned dagger but tangling with wisps armed
only with a dagger is not my idea of a good time. Alternatively I can
save up 50p and go buy a Combine weapon. Ugh. 50p. Seems like an
absolute bloody fortune (and is) on this server. Would take days to
save up that much - could make that in a day fighting wisps but it's
the 'ol Catch-22. I've managed to scrounge a total of 10p, 3 of which
I just spent on my 9th level spells.

So... Any ideas? Anyone at all?

Other than that, I'm having an absolute blast on this server and will
likely stay here once it goes live. There's nothing quite like the
sight of 6 dorfs, all wearing scarab helms and screaming at the top of
their lungs, charging into the gobby camps of Butcherblock or tearing
ass through Crushbone with all the Legos in the zone hot on their
heels.
