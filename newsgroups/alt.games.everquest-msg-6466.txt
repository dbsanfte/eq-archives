Obviously your understanding of abuse is as poor as your understanding
of rape.  However the context is not abusing a woman or raping a woman,
its abusing a rule, or raping a rule,  I think you are a rational person

learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
