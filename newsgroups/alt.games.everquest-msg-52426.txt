By you, perhaps.  Again, you make the classic mistake of thinking you speak
for everyone.  I beg to differ.  I personally know a number of people who
have made eBay transactions and I don't shun them, nor do any of their many
friends.  In fact, I daresay the threat of being shunned by you doesn't
phase them in the least.

Again, I can say that I personally know people who have both bought and sold
on eBay who have an extremely large circle of friends and do a great deal of
socialization.  So, while much of this argument on both our behalfs is
theory and conjecture, this one point of yours is factually wrong.  Also,
you make reference to a class system and place those who are opposed to your
ideas in the "underclass".  However, your class system is only valid within
your own paradigm and actually has no bearing on anything or anyone outside
of it.

But if they twink me I'd still have the same advantage that seems to be such
a threat to you.

Suppose I want to start afresh, but simplify the first ten levels which I

It is?  Okay.  To you it is.

Over who?  You?  What if they are not competing with you?

Yes, you associate broad behavior sets and personality types with a very few
traits and actions, and this is where you exemplify your narrow mindedness
and ignorance.
