Wow, 99.00 bucks. And I paid 399.00.

VooDoo5 5500 is an excellent card and anyone who bashes its performance is
probably using a Paradise or Bali card anyone. I wouldn't worry.

 I run 5 Different systems. I have two set up with EQ. One being an Athlon
1ghz with a GforceDDR64, the other Being a PIII850 using the V5500 64. Side
by side, I see very little difference in playability with EQ. I have
640PC133 MB RAM on the PIII and use Glide exclusively on the VooDoo. The
only difference I have ever seen is with the frame rates in Unreal playing
on the hub. The Gforce does edge out the VooDoo a bit.

 Don't knock your 99.00 card. I think it was a great price for an excellent
card.

Keep it in Glide, you'll be very happy.
