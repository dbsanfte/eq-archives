My personal opinion?  A lot of kids out there run their households, are given
very few rules, and aren't taught proper etiquette.  Why should they behave any
different online?

I didn't say a word.  After the group, as we were running back to the WF camp
he shot me a tell: "sorry I didn't listen to you.  I guess thats why you are
the brains of this group, and I am the brawn."   We had a good laugh, and 4
more people added the idjit to their ignore lists.  
Over, done with, gone :))
