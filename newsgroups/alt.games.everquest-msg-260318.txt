These are perfect examples of where Brad's theory didn't
pan out in reality - these things happen.  However, throwing
everything out when just a few game mechanics needed tweaking
was a bad idea.

Camps?  Have names spawn randomly in the zone from any mob.
Spellbooks during combat?  Don't allow anyone to med if they
or any of their party members are on a hate list.  Balance
the game around NOT medding during combat.

If these (and other) things had been done in beta, I don't
think this game would have some of the horrific problems 
it does now.
