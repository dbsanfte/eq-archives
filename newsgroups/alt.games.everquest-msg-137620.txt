I think you need to read it slowly, here let me help you:

The first statement says that there is a rumor that they will be
making another expansion after POP and the closing down.
What you left out was the part about it being called "Exodus"
which doesn't exist, so he goes on to say in his 
second statement  that that is NOT true. There is no "Exodus".
It does not exist in any way shape or form.
Which means ( for those of you that don't know) " a departure of many
people".

No "Exodus", no expansion after POP.

Now where in his statement does he confirm a expansion after POP?


Got it, good.
