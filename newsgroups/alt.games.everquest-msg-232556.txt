From personal experience, BoT camps are quite doable for a shaman healer, 
given a level 65 tank with decent equipment and AAs.  Quiessence is 
enough for almost all the healing, with the odd quick heal needed when 
slow is resisted mostly.  I much prefer having a druid or cleric to heal, 
as when the shit hits the fan, my heals are, to say the least, 
innadequate.
