Never encountered a stupid customer? Tens of thousands of people? Um - we
are not at a marketing convention, we deal with reality here don't we? You
can leave your motivational speech at the door.... really, it's allowed.

Yes - we have some very great "people" people too working as technicians.
They always leave cheerful but sometimes frustrated customers, because at
the end of the day the problem isn't always fixed.

I have never seen a session of foot stomping, feet pounding or any outbursts
at all in this job. We would be immediately removed. We all use humour as a
safety valve. Remember humour?

Who said I can't stand the heat? On the phone I am a different person. I
have almost inhuman patience and I never display anger or exasperation <on
the phone>. I am the tech that customers are consistently asking to be put
through to, and you know what, it's not because I am Mr Prozac cheerful or
blowing sunshine up their asses either. It's just because I have the
patience and experience to get problems fixed.

That doesn't mean I have to like people though. As a matter of fact, it is
one of the reasons I dislike people so much, all that time being impassively
bomabarded by stupidity.
