My babbling cut about xp cons ;)

That is because, as I said, the con is reflecting the xp you'd get not
the level of difficulty of the mob. Its always been that way. The
thing is that more newb mobs are going to be easy when green because
of the type mob they are. My example of a firebeetle is because it is
a strict melee (warrior say) mob with no special abilities, damage, or
ac so its going to be cake for ANYONE when green.

The green messages are sort of like that.. there is no problem then
there is "possibly cause you trouble" when its higher green and
probably xp. They are fixing this I think, on the test server they are
having light blue cons which I think are just any greens that still
would give you xp. Once again though, this is only about xp. Its
always only been about XP. A full green is only green because it will
not give you XP.

yeah I get you and I think it should be more precise but its not.
Abashi or Absor or someone has answered this on the EQ boards several
times and their answer is always something like they don't want you to
know if you can survive a mob for certain, it takes away risk. So
conning will always just refer to xp sort of.

>at least be a bit more informative.

Yeah they do, they always meant xp as far as I know but it just
happens that on lower creatures that also meant they were easy since
they had no special abilities.

Yeah, its not going to change. However, they are adding that light
blue con evidently if it makes it through test. I'm pretty sure after
they do that we will know that NO green will give us xp since the high
greens will all be light blue. However, will a green still kick your
butt? Possibly they will still destroy you because its just the xp
they give you for your level that reflects their con. 

Really the reason verant did that was to not have all the work of the
exact way that you'd want to do cons. I mean think about it, to really
make con reflect a mob's power vs YOUR power, they'd have to make an
othmir warrior blue to my 55 druid while making it red to your 55
warrior because my 55 druid is not going to get hit while your 55
warrior HAS to get hit. The con system would be incredibly complex and
use a complex formula to calculate abilities on both sides and just
like Verant says we'd be left with no ability to take chances. 

The first time dragoon zytl, in WC, was blue to my druid and I tried
him he destroyed me. He did a couple more times also but suddenly he
was still blue to me and very easy. The difference was that I had more
hp, ressed his fear more, and had better spells to deal with him. I
like it that way because it made it so I was taking a chance to feel
how powerful he was the first times I fought him. If instead I conned
him and it said "he will kick your butt!" then later when it knew I'd
res him more and had better spells "you will kick his butt!" where is
the fun, the exploration, the sense of danger?
