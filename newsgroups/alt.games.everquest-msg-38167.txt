Seen this happen to Shardwurms too.  You pull em out of the cave and they
pop back, except on top of the mountain instead of inside.  Its a pain to
figure out where they went.

P.S.  Quad kiting druids are only good for cooking.  They stole my Ulthorks
and now they're stealing my Wyverns.  And to top it off, they're usually an
antisocial types.  Certian ones I have marked down and will NEVER invite
them to group on any raid.
