A discussion on the AGE group late night made me think. We all
complain about a few things, themes begin to repeat. One repeating
theme is names. Now that the game is getting mature, there are fewer
names to pick from. I am sure we can pick better.

A few thought names that were obviously stupid, like Qtelf,
superdeathwarriorman, killah, cannibaschronic, among others deserve
our derision and scorn. My apologies if these are your character
names.

I agree, and I have a little clue for those who don't agree. People
will judge you. Absolutly, you are judged everyday. You are even
pre-judged. All the time, and more than you think. Of course, judging
you on the basis of race isn't permitted, but I think that is pretty
much gone in America.

Walk up to a big-sales-store and ask for a job. If you walk up with a
suit and a slick haircut and say, "Hello, I would like an application
please"; you may get an interview. Walk up with a jacket with a big
reefer leaf on it, jeans and an eyebrow ring and say, "Dude, can I get
an application. Do you have a pen? What is today's date? How much do
you pay? I can't work Saturdays, that's my party night!";  you may get
an interview, for comedy. Walk up with dirty pants and a ripped tee,
and say "cough hack - got some change please?"; you may get the door.

This is the same thing with names. Sorry all, this is a creative game.
How you present yourself give us every right to judge you.
