I didn't look at your magelo..it's running late in the day...but my
enchanter is level 62 in case that makes my opinion worth something.

As long as your CHA is around 120 unbuffed, you should be fine.  If you're
worried about getting stuff to stick, just keep your best CHA buff on
yourself...but I have never seen any difference between a CHA of 120 and
200.
