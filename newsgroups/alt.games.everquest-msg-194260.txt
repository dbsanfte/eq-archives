Why indeed.  Until you can answer that question, working on the premise that
it's true is kinda silly.

There isn't one.  Trust me.  There is a spot where you can potentially call
to, as long as you call everybody that can feign first and then have as many
people called while invisible as possible before somebody's invis breaks and
the fighting starts.

The places I'd recommend for that are either in one of the far corners of
the square by Prince or behind the fakewall in the hallway before King. 
Both have advantages and risks.

Nothing.  You fight different things.  One path might be a bit easier, but
if you're doing the royals (and plan on winning) then nothing else in
Chardok will be difficult enough to matter.

You can pacify anywhere the mobs aren't immune.  Whether it works or not is
entirely dependent upon the intelligence of your raid force.

And my absolute best advice is to not plan on CoH'ing at all.  It's risky
and completely not necessary.  If you've got a force capable of taking the
royals, the stuff on the way down should be a cakewalk.
