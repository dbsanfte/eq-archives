I got the spell this morning for 75pp, couldn't pass it up even if it 
seems pretty useless.  Reagents, however, I see three traders selling, 
one at 200pp, one at 195pp, the third at 190pp.  They have 10, 19, and 
34 units, respectively, so SOMEBODY thinks they sell at those prices.

I made a couple of the gate necks and put them up at 10pp, no takers in 
5 hours.

How much does a gate potion to Thurgadin actually run, for a melee?

Splendid
