Drop it, monkey boy.

I seem to recall the server scan on Everquest.com always being
"broken" before. I also definately recall a few recent mass LDs where
rezzes were offered by GMs. Yes, when there are massive connectivity
losses, they do reimburse.

But, guess what? Sometimes it is your ISP/computer/region that's the
problem. Duh.
