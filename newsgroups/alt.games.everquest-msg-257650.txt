Yeah it does, to be honest. The whole deal about meditating is shutting
yourself off from the real world, entering a state of true relaxation.
Entering such a state during a battle would be tough, but I like to think
masters are able to meditate at any time except when they're pounded on :)

I agree it's boring though, and would love to see a system where mana regen
is fixed regardless of state.
