Sounds like fun.  I have not gone there with a pickup group.  Went with my
shaman at 52, 53 Monk, 54 Paladin, 54 Cleric, and a 52 Rogue.  We did not go
deep, we just fought in the first few rooms, and killed mostly blues, a few
greens.  No deaths.  I did go on a crawl through a large part of the zone as
well once, when I was level 49 or so, with 3 or 4 groups from the guild.
Again, we had fun, no deaths, we did not take on any of the Uber mobs there.
I think the best drop we got was some beer summoning goggles.
