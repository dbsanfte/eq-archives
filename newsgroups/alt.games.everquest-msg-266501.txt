The playtime was in reference to his changing work schedule.  If you are an
"East Coast Raider" and you aren't in the game during east coast primetime 5
days out of 7, you're not going to be able to jump guilds and get anywhere
close to where he is now, unless he wants to raid with the Koreans of
course.  =)

And maybe I have a skewed view of AAs in a raiding guild.  I've been told
more than once that my guild has higher AA requirements than all of the top
guilds.  I know I've been shocked more than once while grouped with people
from one of the higher guilds to find out just how many AAs they were
lacking that I considered standard for anyone who raids.

I think you just described most any "raiding" guild.  Attendance,
number of people who disappear as soon as the raid is over, number of
members, number at raids, etc.  =)
