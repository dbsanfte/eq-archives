Just comeback to the game, after a being away for awhile, and wanted to roll 
up and erud necro, when I went to character sel the necro option was greyed 
out. I have downloaded the optional zone files, that give you access or used 
to give you access to paineel, but no luck. Anyone know whats going on. I 
have EQ ori and Kunark and Vel, and I seem to be able to access the pok.
