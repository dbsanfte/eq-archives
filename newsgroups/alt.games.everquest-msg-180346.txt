But to be fair he did say he was a druid.

I remember when they used to smack my mage so bad, damn he struggled at 35..
a) to get a damn group b) level c) keep his level

So i made a human monk.. I saw other humans interact safely with goons..
werd im safe in OT!
So the goons are trained near me, I just stand fighting..
smack,smack,smack,smack,HT,dead.

I *still* kill goons whenever Im in or near OT.. heck 1 time I even went
pulling goons from the outpost (till the General agrod, HT'd, and made me
run like a girl)
