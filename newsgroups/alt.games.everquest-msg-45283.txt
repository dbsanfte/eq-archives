Actually I think the Millers in Question here are the ones in QH which
actually have a tension of sorts with Surefall glade and the
rangers/druids there, so from a roleplaying stand point it could be seen
as protecting the animals of the glade, since these two are hunters and
promote poaching.

I do agree it's in a grey area of ethics do you kill them cause they
promote poaching or do you not kill them as they aren't truly evil
either.  I have left them alone with my druid, but that's just my
preference.
