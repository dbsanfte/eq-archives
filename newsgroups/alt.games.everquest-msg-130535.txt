}terrorism..

Have you noticed that 'motive' and 'justify' are two completely different 
words?  They're even spelled different.  Just something you might want to 
think about.

We don't have to justify terrorism to try and understand why it happens 
and what might lead someone to do something like that.

Just like we aren't justifying someone murdering his wife when we finally 
realize it's because she always burnt the coffee.

I haven't once seen anyone in this thread try to 'justify' terrorism.  
Although a few people have suggested that there may have been a motive.
