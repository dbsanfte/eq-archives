I'm not sure what you mean by "claimed a couple on my main".
In my experience, when I've claimed the Veteran Rewards on a
character (and clicked the confirmation box), I got all of
the rewards the account was entitled to.  I wasn't given a
choice of individual rewards on each character.

Further, Wrath of the Wild isn't a Veteran Reward, and neither
is Ardent Recovery.  Frankly, it sounds to me like when you
went back and looked, you were looking at the wrong tab in the
AA window.  Try clicking on the Veteran tab?
