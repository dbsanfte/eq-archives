I think you'll like SWG then.  Now, keep in mind I'm not a dev so I might be
a bit inaccurate here, but this is based on the many hints the devs have
given.  To make something with a tradeskill, you have to make a schematic (a
design for the item).  Your schematics do not "fail" and make you lose
everything you put into them.  The schematics you can create are based on
your current skill.  You create a schematic and, after buying the
appropriate materials, you can either create a prototype (which destroys the
schematic) or feed the schematic into a factory you've built, and that
factory, so long as it has the necessary materials, will continue to create
that item even when you're logged off.  The prototype and/or the items
produced by the factory can be sold, traded, or given away, as is your
choice.  Then, every time one of those items is used, even if you're logged
off, you get an experience-point dump that can be used to advance that skill
(or any other skill, for that matter) further.  So, say you want to learn to
build droids.  There will be some schematics you can make with only the most
basic skill, which you can get without experience.  You make one of those
schematics, buy the necessary materials, and feed the schematic and the
materials into your factory.  Log off and when you come back there'll be a
heap of droids waiting for you at the factory.  Take those droids to your
NPC-run store and put them on the shelves.  Log off, people buy a few of
your droids, and use them.  When you get back, you suddenly have (1) a pile
of exp points you can use to train your next skill point, and (2) a pile of
money you can use to buy whatever materials you might need.  Isn't that
something along the lines of what you were thinking of?
