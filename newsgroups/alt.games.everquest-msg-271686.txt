In my comment above the point was that Apple has produced many 
innovative products over the years whereas in contrast Microsoft has 
not. Where Apple has produced many models of ever improving computers 
and peripherals over the years along with the software to go with them, 
Microsoft has only developed software primarily. And where Apple was 
first to introduce a graphical OS to personal computer users, Microsoft 
was a distant second. In terms of desktop features and design, many 
features seen in Windows today, made their first appearance in Apple's 
operating systems. And even today, while Apple has moved ahead and 
married their elegant interface to the rock solid, reliable and secure 
UNIX operating system (ok BSD), Microsoft continues to regulary patch 
thier poorly designed Windows to fix the endless parade of security 
flaws that continue to rear their ugly heads on an all too regular 
basis. The very successful Apple iPod is just the lastest example of 
innovation from Apple. And prior to that it was the iMac line of computers.

I'm sorry, but who you have working in your research dept. does not 
define how innovative your companies products are and certainly does not 
change the history of these two companies when compared side by side in 
terms of what they have actually brought to market over the years.

As someone who has worked in speech recognition development for example, 
I can tell you that Microsoft some time ago spent a great deal of money 
hiring some of the best and brightest talent in that area to work for 
them. But in the meantime, they have not shipped anything worthy of 
note. In fact, I do not think they have shipped anything at all. 
Meantime, Dragon Systems has released some very impressive speech 
recognition software and has actually been doing so for a good number of 
years now. Who would you call an innovator? Dragon Systems who actually 
brought the power to create text documents on computers to people who 
because of disability could in no other way ever write? Or do you think 
that the Microsoft think tank folks in the speech area should be called 
the innovators?

Research is all well and good and of course needed. But research groups 
do not define whether a company ought to be considered innovative or 
not. I don't care if they are furthering human knowlege or not. That 
knowlege is essentially useless until you put it to work and actually 
produce something that benefits people. In my book, performance is 
measured in terms of tangible results, as is innovation.

Tell me, what has Microsoft invented? MS-DOS? Well I guess. But of 
course it was preceded by CPM and better still of course, UNIX. Windows? 
Well, sort of. Except windowed interfaces for PCs were really pioneered 
in Palo Alt Research and the first commercial implementation on personal 
computers was done by Apple. Internet Explorer? Well, not really. They 
got the source code for that from an already established browser and 
Netscape was the first commercially successful browser until Microsoft 
bundled IE free with Windows and killed them. Computer hardware of any 
kind, like say the iMac which I think most would agree was an innovative 
product, particularly the first ones? Umm, nope not really unless you 
want to give them credit for making mice and keyboards but of course 
they didn't invent those although I will give them credit for producing 
decent ones. Has Microsoft created any kind of portable music player 
like the iPod? Nope. Can they really compare to Apple in terms of 
producing innovative products. Well, I don't think so myself.

And as far as advancing the knowlege of mankind goes, just what has 
Microsoft actually accomplished to this end that is of any real value 
today at all? At least the collective minds working on Linux have 
something of real value to show for thier efforts. Ditto for the good 
folks at Mozilla. Microsoft does have competeting products in these 
areas but unfortunately, they are inferior. Yes, one could argue that 
Windows XP has a more polished interface than say KDE on Linux (and that 
is a debatable point) but unfortunately, under the covers Windows fails 
in many areas particularly in terms of security, where Linux shines.

Do you really believe there is no R&D at Apple? Do you think Steve Jobs 
just sits in his office and says to his staff, "OK guys, I just had a 
great idea called iMac. Here it is, now go build them. Oh, and when you 
get done with that I want you to start manufacturing something else 
we're going to call the iPod." Give me a break. Of course they have R&D 
at Apple. These products don't just invent themselves. And what about OS 
X? Do you think that just created itself? Who designed that interface 
and the marriage between it and BSD? Was than an immaculate conception 
or something?

OK, and why does every other player support WMA? Because Microsoft built 
it into Windows so to speak when it became the default format for their 
media player. So when Creative Labs and the rest of them want to sell 
Portable players to the Windows using masses of course they need to 
support WMA. That hardly means WMA ever needed to come into existence.

I'm glad the iPod does not support WMA. There's no need. My daughter is 
a Windows user with an iPod and this has caused her no inconvenience 
whatsoever. I plan to get an iPod myself. But I would never pollute it 
with WMA files even if it would accept them.

Actually, iTunes does work in Linux with a product called 
Crossover-Office by a company called Codeweavers. Word, Excel and a 
number of other Windows applications run in Linux as well with this same 
product. Not that I would want to run those mind you, but for those who 
need them the opportunity to use them in Linux exists today.

Many of today's most popular PC game titles run in Linux now too with a 
product called Cedega that translates DirectX9 calls to OpenGL calls. 
Although it's still best to keep a partition running Windows available 
with a dual boot setup for PC gamers to ensure they can play anything 
they want to. World of Warcraft and EverQuest play perfectly in Linux 
with Cedega for example from what I understand. EQ2 does not yet but it 
too probably will soon would be my guess.
