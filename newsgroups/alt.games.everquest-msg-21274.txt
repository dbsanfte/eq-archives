This stuff makes me laugh.  It's a game people.  Names are for
characters in a GAME.  If the person that creates the character
likes the name and it is not profane then it is just fine.  I
realize Verant is a bit anal about this (obviously so are some of
the players) but lets get real here.  There are around 3000 accounts
per server and I would guess an average of 3 characters per account
so that is 9000 names not counting NPC.  Not an infinite amount of
names for sure, but some are more popular than others it seems (I
can't tell you the number of Thor's or a variation thereof I have
seen).  Does this offend or bother me?  Not in the least, but then I
am not a self-righteous individual that gets my sense of self-worth
from a computer game.

Myself I limit my names to 5 or less letters.  My reasoning is just
to make it easier for people to send tells or to make note of my
name if they feel the need.
