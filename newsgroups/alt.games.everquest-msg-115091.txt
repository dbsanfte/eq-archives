Hear hear.  Buy them potions.  I still sow people if I'm not otherwise
occupied, but I do fund my tradeskill habits with SoW potions.  They have a
tidy profit margin, and I rarely fail at making them anymore.
Unfortunately, few of the other potions are sellable, as they are just too
expensive to make.  I have sold countless SoW potions, 3 10 dose shrink
potions, 1 10 dose Purity, 2 10 dose ITU potions, and 1 10 dose DS potion.
I have completely given up on even trying to sell anything but SoW potions,
I do make others to order, but that is the only way I will make them, or for
my own, or my guilds, personal use.
