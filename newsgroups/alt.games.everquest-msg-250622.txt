I wouldn't bother with memblur.

I'd just haste/clarity/rune/buff the power levelee, and slow/debuff 
mobs, and use a level appropriate animation, and maybe a few low dots to 
accelrate the dps provided you don't exceed the power levelees.

Pull a mob, debuff it, let your pet engage it, dot it if the power 
levelee is doing adequate damage...

The lowbie will chew through mobs as fast as you can pull them, and work 
up his skills in the process. XP should roll in pretty fast, not as fast 
as what some other classes can accomplish...but...

The disavantage to druid powerlevelling is that you usually get a gimp 
at the end who then has to spend a fair bit of time working his 
skills... after you factor in the extra time to work up the skills is it 
really that much faster??
