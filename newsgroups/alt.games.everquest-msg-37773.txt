The only thing I can think of in your level range is the first of
the Symbol of Tunare quests. The reward is, IIRC, Initiate Symbol
of Tunare, which is a neck slot with 2wis. Names and actual vis
bonus might be wrong, this is from my bad memory...

OK, still going from memory (Don't read this! Spoilers! RUN AWAY!)

Talk to your guildmaster in your hometown, I think his name
is Yeloarn Bronzeleaf or something. He'll want you to give
him four bone chips, after you give him those he'll ask
you to get him four ghast hearts. These hearts drop off "A
rancorous ghast" in Lesser Faydark, wandering mobs which
are on the same spawn as other wandering undeads. Getting
four hearts is a major PITA, since they're rare drops off
somewhat uncommon mobs, and there are many dangers in the
zone (Brownies, Teir'Dal Elites, Shadowed Men).

The Ghasts are undead and should be green, maybe low blue
at 18, so load Sense the Dead and your best Undead nuke
and start killing all the wandering undead you can find.
But stay in the northern part of the zone, and keep your
Divine Aura ready in case you meet Brownies or other deep
reds!

HTH,

Rune
