yes try all and see what you like. you have 8(i think)character slots per
server and like i dont know...lets just say a lot of servers so you have a
lot of space.i started with a wood elf ranger.and also if money is holding
you back they have the origanal game in just a jewel case for $10..later
down the road you can get the expansions.
