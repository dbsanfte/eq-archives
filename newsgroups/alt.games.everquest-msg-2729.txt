LOL!

The other day I confused a couple of newbies myself.

I got nuked by the Iksar Crusaders in the Field of Bone while trying
to turn in bone chips to Trooper Mozo.  Thankfully I had had the
foresight to bind at the Kaesora entrance in the same zone, so
I dragged my corpse to safety and looted all but one item, then
went shopping for a cleric nearby who could do an exp rez.  I
found one, but he was in Kaesora at the time and wouldn't be
out for about an hour, so I told him no rush and parked my
corpse at the Kaesora entrance and then went about more of my
business in FoB.

When the cleric was finally ready, I happened to be in the Pit
helping out a couple of lowbie Iksars (buffing, etc.) and
letting them inspect my armor (FoB seems to have a lot of
first-time newbies, and doesn't get a lot of traffic from
high-level characters, so you can still get many oohs and
ahhs if you pass through with a level 50 character, unlike most
other places in EQ these days).

Just then, the Cleric asked me if I was ready for the rez, so
I told him yes, and asked the lowbies if they'd like to see
a Paladin teleport.  They seemed puzzled but said yes, so I
cast Divine Might (which makes a strange spell effect, like
cannibalize), then pressed "Yes" to accept the rez.

Poof!

They're probably STILL trying to figure that one out...
