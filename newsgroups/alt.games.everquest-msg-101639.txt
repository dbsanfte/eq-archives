I figured out how I did it, we were waiting on the rest
of a raid force to go into the hole, and we started taking
out the entry Elemental warriors.  Ungrouped, I just set
my pet to helping him.  I looked at my log (curiosity got
the better of me.)  *5* procs of the swords of runes in
the pet's hands :)

I can see why the nerfed them, if they did that with
that kind of frequency angainst any target, they were
way broken.
