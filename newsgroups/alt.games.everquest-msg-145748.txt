Its a diabetic cat.. ITS A CAT. Time to bring it to the vet for the
big sleep and get another parasitic feline. 

Who is that comedian who tells that joke? Its a joke where
the doctor says all this stuff wrong with his cat and what it
will cost and he goes, "Uhhh.. can't I just get another cat?" Then
he goes on to say "I mean they are FREE! ITS A CAT!"
