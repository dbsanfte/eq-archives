But that's just it. It doesn't matter if the time overrun is caused by
incompetence, equipment issues, a full moon, or because Bob the programmer
forgot to sacrifice a live chicken to the server gods. If the vast majority of
your downtimes go significantly over the estimated time, then you need to start
increasing your time estimates. The inability to do that could certainly be
seen as incompetence or, at the very least, lack of interest in customer
service. I doubt many people would say, "Oh, look. The servers are back up
early. Those bastards!"

The road traffic in my area is famous for being bad and unpredictable. If I
arrive at work 45 minutes late most days, it's not because I'm a bad (or
incompetent) driver. It just means I need to adjust the time I allow for
travel. If I arrive at work early, my boss isn't likely to complain.
