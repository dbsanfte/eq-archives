Hi. I've been playing EQ since it's inception on a WIndows 98 system, but
recently got a new computer running Windows 2000. Whenever there is a disk
access (ie. auto saving my character) the game freezes during the disk
access. If you play a bard like me this can be more than annoying. I have no
doubt it's some sort of configuration problem. Does anyone have any ideas as
to what I can do to correct this? Thanks in advance...
