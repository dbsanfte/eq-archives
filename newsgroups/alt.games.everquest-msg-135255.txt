Okay, I'm going to give this a shot before I tell them to take their game 
and stuff it where the sun doesn't shine.

When the last mega-patch came through, I lost the ability to play EQ on 
the computer I was using at the time.  About a month ago, I got hold of my 
GOOD computer, managed to get more memory installed, and actually got EQ 
up and running again.

And now this patch comes along, and I'm back to the same jerky, unplayable 
frames that I had before I bought new memory.

Help?

Running a Rage Pro Turbo AGP 2x video card
320MB of memory
I have none of the Lucelin models selected
Dynamic lighting is off (though it ran fine when it was on pre-patch)

Thoughts, recommendations and fixes greatly appreciated, because I'm 
sitting here wondering why the hell I'm paying $13 a month for a game that 
I can't play every time they decide to "fix" it.
