Well, Kscum.. 

its about time we revisited this most interesting
subject, there hasn't been a decent thread about
it for hours.

What I usually do is rush out to the tattooist,
and have the name of the offending mongrel
inscribed on my forehead in reversed red
lettering. This enables me to remember his or her
name with a simple glance into the magnifying
mirror attached to my monitor.

I can thus ensure that I will never again help,
accidentally or otherwise, that most miserable
creature who dared to defy all known standards of
honesty and decency, and is, in all probability a
sexual deviant.

Another method is to say "fuck off"
