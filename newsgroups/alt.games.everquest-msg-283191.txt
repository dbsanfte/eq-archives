I want nothing to do with anything SoE gets it's talons into.  No way
I support a company that changes how a class is played 10 months after
release(Warlocks in EQ2)...or lie to their customers and say a world
wide quest to unlock a race is in game...only to find out later the
quest wasn't there and people wasted hours and hours and hours trying
to find/solve it.  To hell with that company.  It's no wonder WoW is
crushing them.
