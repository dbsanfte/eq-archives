That's correct. Sadly Yahoo considers every vbulletin forum a spammer.
I won't be surprised if other message boards suffer from this same
problem. I'll search through vbulletin.com to see if anyone has thought
of a way around this.

Very true, but I don't think that there's much difference between
someone new to newsgroups finding it in his/her Outlook Express while
totally unaware of the Usenet guidelines and those finding it here. We
do offer (or will, rather) a lot of information about correct usage, on
the contrary to Outlook Express ;)

You're welcome there/here either way :)
