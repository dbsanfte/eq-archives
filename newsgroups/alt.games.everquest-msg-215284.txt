    It's fixed as of two days ago, when my rogue was playing across from a
51 WAR twink from my guild that had both. I don't know about the proc level,
as the person was 51, but Lucy still doesn't list an "effect level" so it's
likely still level 1.

    No, the proc rate on both of them is pretty miserable. I know this from
listening to the same level 51 warrior complain about how poor his proc rate
was, with full shaman dex buffs and whatever DEX bard songs can add, and
from having effects turned on and seeing directly how infrequently he'd
proc. For the sake of comparison, for every proc he got on either his sword
or hammer, I was getting one proc from my mainhand Gomdurig.

    Zero second stuns. They interrupt spellcasting, but do nothing else that
a solo warrior would care about. Compare this with the Adamantite Club and
Baton of Royal Stature, monk weapons with 6 second stuns, or the Tranquil
Staff with its 12 second stun.
