Well, nothing would beat the stupidity of that, if there were only one,
ever.  Given that a new Faydedar spawns at some point after the previous one
was killed, it would not be entirely out of place.  (Not to mention, in the
case of Faydedar there are two, aren't there, the triggered one, and the
normal spawn one).  Your point however is valid, it would be a pretty boring
game if all those named mobs only spawned once.
