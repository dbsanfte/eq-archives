You did the right thing not to rez the KS'er. These type of players in
RM are becoming more and more common. Since the GMs really wont do
anything about it, the only justice that can be served is by the
players. By getting a bad rep and people start to stand up to this
kind of crap, it will get harder and harder for this "person" to play.
What really sucks is that everyone pays in the end as they nerf the
drop rate of the giants.

As for not rezzing the rogue, the same principle applies. You dont
have to rez anyone you dont want to. You are not breaking any SOE
policy by refusing to do so. This is what i dislike about pickup
groups and generally tend to avoid them. If you are in a good guild
this can be avoided. If someone is in the guild that is like one of
these players, they can always be repremanded and removed from the
guild.
