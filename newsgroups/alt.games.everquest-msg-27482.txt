Dont ask me why im posting this, just want to.

I was doing the tome quest in neriak. I gave the alcoholic caster loads of red
wine, tipped him 70 gold and he replied with the next part of the quest which
tells of a barkeep who has taken a [Vow] of silence. I said:
"What vow?"
no reply from him.
"Tell me of this vow" 
nothing.
"Will she break this vow?"
he is still silent, i get annoyed when this happens.
"What fucking vow are you talking about?!"
"Vow"
"Listen, i want you to tell me about this fucking vow please otherwise i am
going to kill you, vow"
"Tell me about this vow you alcoholic bastard, i gave you a load of wine now
fucking spill the beans about this damn vow"
Then a green message appears in my chat window:
GuildMember_01 tells the guild "Roflmao, youre in guild chat"

I am always doing this! arghhh. Maybe you just had to be there. :)
