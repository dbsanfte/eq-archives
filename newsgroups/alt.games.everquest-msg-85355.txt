There are a lot of seemingly inconsistant facts outlined in the game.  Here
are a few things that may assist you.

As for choice of god, upon the collapse of civilization, what force provided
justice and balance in the northern wastes?  That could explain the limited
choices for the bringers of justice.  The shaman are not well known for
their tollerance whereas the previous gods were very tollerant in
comparison.  Strict rules for harsh times.

The loss of pure clerics (shaman are a priest class NOT clerics) isn't to
hard to understand in a harsh frozen waste.  Those with "lesser" beliefs
would fall by the way side, leaving only the strongest sects to survive --
in this case, the shaman of justice.

As for your spells, they are classed.  That means that others have them as
well.  Heal and harm, cure and infect.  Knowledge of 1 also points at
knowledge of the other *if* that knowledge is persued.  Being as shaman are
potion makers as well, having folks out in the wilderness "researching"
isn't to hard to understand especially as all races that can have shaman are
large, hardy folk who can more easily survive.  The fact that they are in
the wilds may also allow them to discover certain other things (i.e. spells)
to provide to others who may pass by.

From a barbarian perspective, let the small soft city folk deal with their
gods as they see fit but, for the northerners, the rules and regulations
outlined by the Tribunal are NOT to be played with.  Thus one of the
earliest quests you can get is to hunt down a fairly nice fellow who has
broken the rules and bring his head back to the guild.

Fun discussion line no matter how it turns out ;)
