So, your cat spends its life locked in a house, with no exposure to
the outdoors, and gets to enjoy itches it can't scratch every now and
then, but at least it has a responsible owner. Meanwhile, everyone
with cats who don't get those itches anymore and hence aren't bothered
by them, who might have pet doors so the cats can go outside and enjoy
more mental stimuli in addition to the occasional company of other
cats (they ARE social animals, you know. I had one stray die in our
shed, and another cat sat with it all day to keep it company), are
lazy and poor pet owners. Am I understanding you correctly?

Now this would be taking things too far. Ever heard of the cases where
gypsy or retarded girls have been sterilized against their will? It's
not right, and yes I do draw a distinction between animals and humans.
Even though we all have feelings, an animal won't have the same
understanding of something missing. There's a huge difference between
pure instinct procreative mating and what we humans do.
