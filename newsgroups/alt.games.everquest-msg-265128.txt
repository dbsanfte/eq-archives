   In fact, his version of the FAQ looks fantastic.  Alot more links than I
had, so it's easier to navigate.  And the new form allows for more detailed
answers/essays to be posted as separate documents, for the more
encyclopdiaic approach some seem to favor.

   I haven't seen the text only version, but I am very confident that it is
in very good hands.
