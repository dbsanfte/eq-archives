Of course there is no 'rule' or 'law' that requires the MT to do these
decisions, but it has been my experience, that in most cases the group keeps
on swingin away as long as the MT keeps on fighting. It would be nice if (in
the case of a new MT, such as myself) the more experienced players would
warn the group in the case of an 'emergency' (regardless of their leader/MT
status). I have also seen the more experienced magic users / clerics just
take off without warning when they run out of mana, or the fight is going
awry -> please people: communicate!
