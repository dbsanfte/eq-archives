I installed over the top of mine, I bought singly all the expansions as they
shiped. To get to the inventory I just press I and it pops up fine. Check
your mate has installed in in the same dir as the rest of the expansions.
There should only be one Everquest dir. IE look for others like EQ Trillogy
etc.
