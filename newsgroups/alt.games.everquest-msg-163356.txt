Maybe not positively; your AGI drops when you're very encumbered, and that
affects movement speed; when your AGI drops below about 50 you start to 
walk instead of run, and when it drops to about 5 you stop moving
altogether. It could be coincidence that over-encumbrace drops movement
speed and modifies AGI as well, but they look pretty well connected to me.
