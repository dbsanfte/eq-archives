I was working on VP key quests this past week and needed to get to
Timorous Deep.  Since I was in Warslik Woods already, I figured I'd go
via The Overthere.  I had my dark elf illusion up, and Selos Song of
Travel, and verified that none of the guards see invis.  Some tubby
ogre starts yelling that the boat is almost here, so I ran out onto
the dock to wait, and was immediately slammed by an undead mariner
down to less that one bubble of health.  Thankfully I was able to
restart Selos and run at triple-speed to Skyfire zone.  
I came back much, much, much more carefully the second time.  Slid
through the edge of the outpost, and sat about 200 yards off the dock
levitating over the water, hoping that the mariners didn't want to go
swimming.  The ten minute wait for the boat to appear was as scary as
anything I've done in many levels.
