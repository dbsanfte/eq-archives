You are welcome.  I should add that the test was not necessarily entirely
conclusive, one weapon was a 1HS, the other a Piercer, so if your skill
levels were not identical in those, then that could have an effect.   There
are some situations where faster is better, such as that raised by someone
else in the thread, where just about all your hits are for one point anyway,
or when you are attempting to raise your Dual Wield skill level.
