I've got one of each, and the lizard (on my newbie Necro) is the nicer mount
just for the targeting.  The horse fits the character of my Enchanter
though, so no regrets there.

On a side note, I can't *imagine* being a necro without a mount now.  I
tried it for a whopping 10 levels and it makes a huge difference.  (Yeah, I
twinked her with a lizard.  I can't believe I did it, but I did.)
