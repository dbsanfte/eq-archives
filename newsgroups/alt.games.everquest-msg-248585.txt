This is the big problem with mass transit.  If people have cars, they will
use them.  If the government really would like to encourage mass transit,
they need to make it useful enough that people will feel that they can get
by without a car.

To get that level of confidence, they need to not change routes.  In
particular, cancelling routes that have low ridership is wrong.  They do
that, and then end up with systems that only server people on a few routes,
and since the people who ride on those routes also need to go to places not
covered, they need cars.
