They've made no indication that the maps will be saleable.  I think that
would be a genuinely Bad Move[tm] (my enchanter owns this trademark since
deciding that charming a yellow con mob to destroy the rest of the zone with
would be a Good Move[tm] (no really, he decided to do it on his own!  I had
nothing to do with it!)).  All they've actually said they're going to
include are maps of starting cities (hooray, i can finally start that DE and
not have to wander around lost in Neriak for an hour and a half trying to
find Nektulos!) and newbie zones (hooray, no more wandering around in
Nektulos wondering where the fuck Neriak is!).  Besides which, there's
already UI mods that include maps of all zones in a low-alpha window, so I
don't see how this is any more spoilery than already exists.

It's not like you _have_ to use the new system.  In most cases, I probably
won't.  But that doesn't mean i don't think it's a good thing overall for
new players or even veterans who have trouble with navigation.  There are
people out there in their 30s who can't find their way from the bbm druid
circle to gfay (or vice versa).
