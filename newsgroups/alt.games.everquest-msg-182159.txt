It happens to me all the time. I'm running around solo, looking for that 
next mob to kill. I spot one not too far away, standing still, facing the 
other direction. 

I take off running toward it, thinking, "Don't move. Don't you dare move 
you cursed little mongrel." I imagine myself picking up my pace, even 
tilt my view down just a tad to lean into your stride, like that's really 
gonna help.

I'm almost there. The mob hasn't moved. It's still facing away from me, 
oblivious to my approach. A smile spreads across my face as I begin 
incrementing the xp bar in my head. I imagine myself lurching forward for 
that first surprise attack, intent on doing maximum damage to this 
unsuspecting critter - heck, I've even been known to jump that last 
stride to execute a predatory pounce.

Then, just as my finger hovers over the auto-attack key, but a split-
second before it decends, the mob whirls on me and >*SMACK*<. I nearly 
wet myself and my world slowly turns for the next few seconds while I 
mash the directional keys in a futile attempt to come back to my senses.

The fight goes down. I win, as expected. At the end, I have the xp I was 
counting on in addition to an elevated heart rate.

/em shakes his head.

I still suffer from the illusion in the heat of the moment that I'm 
actually able to sneak up on mobs, though I know darned well it's not one 
of my racial or class abilities. Heck, even on my characters that *do* 
have it, I never think to use it.

Rumble <--- sometimes a hammer doesn't even drive the point home
