Though I've not parsed it myself, I've never seen any information that 
stated overhaste songs do not stack with haste spells (it would be much 
more difficult, if not impossible to ever reach the haste cap without 
haste spells, much less have a need to exceed it), and since haste spells 
are the same haste type as haste songs, it would stand to reason that the 
overhaste songs would indeed stack with the normal haste songs. Reed's 
Song Spreadsheet supports this reasoning. It can be found here:

That makes sense. The potion would be the same as a haste buff (spell) 
and therefore would not stack with a normal haste song.

Curious, is that a self-only 25% haste clicky or targettable? I could see 
benefits to it, including the fact that it would be a static buff as 
opposed to a song that needed twisting. Also, on less developed servers 
such as the progression types, being able to free up a song slot might be 
giving up a small percentage of haste than on more developed servers, 
where much of the bard functionality has been somewhat marginalized.
