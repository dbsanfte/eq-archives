I don't know where it's specifically stated that killing bankers is
considered distruption, but since the GM's will intervene over it, it must
fall into that category.  It is an interruption of the game because the
banker is a necessary NPC no one else can do what the banker does.  What if
you need money for a rezz but can't get any out of the bank because the
banker is dead? Or you need the extra coffin you keep in the bank? Or you
need some of the batwings or bonechips you keep in the bank?  In some zones
it wouldn't be that big of a deal because there are other banks nearby, but
even with POP, Highkeep is still somewhat remote.

Kael is probably a little different because the zone is a MOB city and not a
standard city and the majority of us are KOS there.  There aren't a lot of
people depending on Kael as a place to do their banking.
