Good idea for a post. Here are a few of my impressions. Hopefully someone 
can correct me where I'm wrong.

I was under the impression that a mob gives the same number of base 
experience points to anyone who kills it. That reward would just naturally 
be less of a percentage gain for players a few levels higher. Add to that 
base number any ZEM, group or yellow/red mob bonuses as well as any 
class/race modifiers that still exist.

Regarding pets, I understand it to still go by the "do at least one point 
and get max pet class xp" rule, as long as no one outside of the pet 
owner's group outdamaged the pet owner's group.

As far as damage shields go, I've done a good deal of power-levelling 
lately, and I can say that DS damage is not considered if the person 
wearing the DS does no other damage. I can't say for certain if it counts 
100% otherwise, however.
