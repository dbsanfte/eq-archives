	Perhaps better, to make both of ya happy, would be a filter 
in whatever your list of quests looks like where you could 
manually just change their order to be by zone given, order 
given (chronological), zone destination (but only for those 
quests that have revealed such info already), level, quest 
type, etc...  Then ya wouldn't have to read the text of 50 
or more quests to find the one you know is there but forget 
where in the order it is, but ya wouldn't have a big 
exclamation point or arrow or some such out in the game 
world telling ya how to do anything either.
