people were crashing on zone, and /tells wouldnt work to specific zones
(people didn't receive the tells you sent)

they said all the servers would be coming down for 15 minutes, so we did one
last big pull (we were AE'ing D1+D2 in Seb) and figured we had time for a
small AE from D1 to the zoneout, when the white "world coming down" message
started spamming the screen.  We succored to the zonein and froze/got
booted.. I think as soon as they set the servers to shut down, all zoning is
disabled and you get booted
