Actually, I don't believe it was a 'bug', rather a side effect of a
jerry-rigged fix for the problem of not being able to sit on a horse.

If it was a bug, they could've just as easily make you dismount to med,
but clearly they intended medding to be done on horseback. Unsure why
they couldn't implement /sit since you don't need a separate graphic
(eg: sham bearform)

I doubt medding while attacking was a bug simply because it's so
obvious, even cursory testing would've discovered it. If that was the
bug, just add something along the line of "IF horse=yes THEN med=no'. I
think it was simply under-estimated how powerful it would be for soloing
hybrids who would never have any downtime whatsoever. Even kiting druids
still expend mana faster than they can med it to be effective soloing,
and have downtime after fights. 

Whatever it is, nerf, bug fix, tweak, it's targetted specifically at
hybrids who were medding while meleeing, rather than all casters medding
on horseback.
