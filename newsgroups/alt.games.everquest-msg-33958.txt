Hehe, first time i have ever seen anyone calling quests for cheats.

Oh, and another way to get easy XP if you can port to WC, is to head to
Lake Rathe, a gnome on one of the islands, cannot remember which. Hes a
part of one of the epics.
Talk to him, and get the coin from him.
Bind yourself in front of him.
Port to WC
Find the NPC that roam the forest a little south of the entrance to Kith
(again i cannot remember name, long time ago).
Hand him the coin.

That give you ok XP and no faction hits (or gains).

Gate to Lake Rathe and repeat untill your damn tired of it.
