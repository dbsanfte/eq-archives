A.  What video card?  If it's a voodoo 1/2/3 then it's not supported.
B.  Mouselook or keyboard to turn?  I've heard the keyboard is *really*
      sensitive.

People with PII/K6-2 processors in the 400-500mhz range are getting
decent framerates, but they usually have a non voodoo card.

You were playing in first person.  There are no 1st person animations,
and Mythic hasn't committed to including them.  Their design revolves
around 3rd person.  (They are considering the 1st person animations
after enough people posted about it).
