I'm at 132 right now.  Just dropped like 80pp to get it up to that the
other night, although I got back a bit of that when I sold those
arrows and bought stuff for my normal 1/150 arrows.  

I'm sure it mitigates a bit of the cost at once you start on the
silver since, according Aoenla, silver nets you 10 arrows per
successful combine, but still that got to be expensive to be shooting
for just and exp grind.

And, on a vaguely related note:  What is the relationship between dex
and archery.  IIRC, dex is taken into account, but to what extent?  Is
it worth it for a Ranger to put a lot of plat into dex gear?
