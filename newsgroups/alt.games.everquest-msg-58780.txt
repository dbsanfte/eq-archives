Of course, usually you'll be "nominating" them after the chanter
whispers in your ear and tells you which one (s)he thinks should be
next, based on which one got mezzed first, their experience and previous
success in mezzing various types of mobs, mana remaining, etc.

Oh, and make sure you taunt the next mezzed mob a few times before just
starting to whack on it. Chanters will love you for it.
