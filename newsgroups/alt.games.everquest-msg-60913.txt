I was going through the /help command last night (looking up the no drop
thingie) and found there are 2 new /commands in the game

/bazaar
and
/trader

both do nothing on their own (just typing /bazaar), but putting anything
after (sucvh as /bazaar on or /bazaar test) yields the following message:

"You must be in the bazaar zone to use this command"

There was talk of adding a bazaar with SoL so I guess these are features
that will help with trading/selling/buying junk.  Anybody heard particulars
on these?
