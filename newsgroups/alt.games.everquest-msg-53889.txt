(I'm a newbie as well)

A high level character saved me from a fight I probably was going
to win. I think it's because the female high elf makes the most
horrific sounds when she get's hit. After it she said she was
sorry if the help was not needed.

My response was something along the lines of "I would much rather
lose a kill than a life". Even if I disagree with their judgement
the fact that they took time to help me is very warming. 

As to the other threads, I do not beg or have any respect for
those who do. I don't inspect since I found the command to turn
it off...not sure why it is on by default.

The only thing I will ask for is a bind affinity after a long run.
As a melee class it is not something I can do myself and I am
very poorly suited to long, nude, corpse runs. If there were
NPC merchants who would sell this service then I would use them
of course.
