I was leveling a shaman in late ldon and hence got interested in
research as a way of getting the rediculously hard to get torpor and
malo spells. I also spent a couple of days and keyed up my rogue alt to
group with a few friends in VT while botting my cleric main on another
computer in hopes of getting the spells there. One thing I noticed was
that the rare parts of torpor and malo seemed to be relatively common on
the few ldon raids we did while I was keeping an eye out for them.

I don't think I ever saw 118 right drop on a regular ldon 65 mission,
dispite helping a friend do his last 20 missions to finish his ldon
charm over the period of a week. I haven't done a lot of hard ones so I
don't know if it drops there, but it hasn't in the few I've done.

From what I can see, the new research drops seem to follow the same
rules as the old research drops; that is, they drop from mobs you'll
typically be fighting about 5 levels past when you can memorize the
spell.

GoD drops are very odd. In the past few weeks of doing trials I've only
seen a couple of pages drop. I think I've gotten something in the order
of 10 copies of 117 left, and very little else. Even from yellow mobs in
koad'tiz trials I haven't seen one rare research drop.

On the plus side, I found the upper 50's spells for my shaman were
non-existant in the bazaar yet I was able to find most of the research
parts for them for relatively reasonable prices. I assume this is
because so few people hunt where those mid 50 spells drop, so in that
regard research fills a nice hole for people.

Another odd thing which is supposedly intentional is that Ferubi mobs
drop luclin spells. Mostly the same ones that dropped in Ssra temple,
and not the rare ones from there like RGC. We thought while doing the
smith raid that it was a bug and it was supposed to be the new god spell
drops but a gm (not a guide) assured us this was intentional after
supposedly checking with the coding staff. Personally I think they copy
and edit loot tables from other zones for new zones, possibly to avoid
the kinds of bugs they had in the past where high end items dropped from
the wrong mobs. Why else would quest stuff from permafrost have been
dropping in Miragul's lab in ldon.
