>What were you planning on hunting in WL by the way?

Tigerraptors for their hides for tailoring, and the portal spells for my 39
druid.  She ported in herself but there was no one else in the zone, *at all*
at 7 PM.  Everything on track was dark blue to red, and she is a chicken.  (I
have the EQ maps but really, they don't show very much....  I confess!!! I was
afraid!!!  I just made 39 and didn't want to lose it.)  
So we figured send in the adults for this job :)  
Plus the ranger has *good* tracking and could "scope out the area" for our
lower level characters as a possible hunting area later....
The wizard "ports in" much faster than the ranger tho due to my crappy old
computer and I didn't want him getting fried before I even got there.
After reading these posts I'm not sure it's worth the risk just to farm some
pelts, though I would still like to get my portal spells.
