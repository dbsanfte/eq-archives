Hey Guys And Gals,


As a 46 druid I neglected learning to quad kite proficiently.  I am a
grouping person mostly.  I am on a job now that forces me to play on off
hours.  I find it hard to find groups a lot.

I have read all the quadding guides on all the web sites but they don't
tell you where to do it.

Specifically I would like a zone for levs 46-50 that I can quad in.

My only quad experience  was a while back in Iceclad and I was quadding
wolves (kind of).  I never really practiced it much.


Also one more thing.


When I group, I am in either SolB or DL.
DL is getting light blue and lava is very hard to find groups in.  What
are a few other populated zones for a 46-50 Druid.


Any help or advice would be great and much appreciated!

TIA
