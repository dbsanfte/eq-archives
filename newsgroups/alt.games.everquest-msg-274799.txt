Ok...I hit level 11.
Made my citizenship.  Took me two days to find that dwarf in the Ardent 
Hills.
Choose Warrior...gonna lean towards beserker.

Is there something I should be working on?
I have 6 silver...so so armor, so so sword (3-9) or something like that.
Ive quested, killed, etc....but, wondering if Im missing something critical 
here.

Storm
