What I don't get is the logic behind whining over that. The fact is
that the way they go about "milking every last dime" out of customers
is BY improving the game experience. I don't give a flying rat's ass
what their reason for doing it is as long as they deliver a good game.
Why the fuck should I care? It's a phenomenally stupid thing to whine
over.

"WAAAH! They're only making our game better to make themselves
richer!!" So fucking what?
