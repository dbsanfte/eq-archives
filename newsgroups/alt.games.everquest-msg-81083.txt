YOU ARE JUST BEGGING TO GET FLAMED!!!
DO NOT POST THOSE KIND OF FILES HERE!

Here is my suggestion to your dilemma.

Most banks have debit cards that act like credit cards and draw from your
checking account. I suggest you check out that avenue rather than propagate
the use of programs and scams that cost Verant money. Heck those devices
working or not cause the cost of playing to go up as Verant has to hire and
program to defeat those devices. Think about it and don't do it.
