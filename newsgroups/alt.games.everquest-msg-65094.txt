Hello,

I just installed Luclin, and am having problems. The old world loads
fine but I do not notice a difference other than it being really dark.
I started a cat and the system boots out when I try to load it
I have

Athalon 1.3
256 MB ram
Geforce 3 ti200

I was asked about reolution and which new models to use when I first
booted up, now I can not access that screen. Any tips?
Thanks,

-Eric
