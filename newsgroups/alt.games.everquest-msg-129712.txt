> Ahhhhhh, ...stooopidity ??

good guess... but next time look into your theories to make sure it isn't
just meaningless bullshit.  it is.
here's yet another link that might educate you.. yes, you've seen it
countless times before.. you simply refuse to inform yourself.
www.amnesty.org  please read my post regarding the moral justification of
suicide bombing.. great quote can be found there.

don't believe me.  i cited my sources.  my sources cite their sources (ZMAG
sources are listed at the bottom).  research it out for yourself, if your
will is as strong as your ability to spit out meaningless bullshit.  and
your sources?  unsupported opinions?  hardly a credible source.  here's a
lesson for you in simple terms a person of your ignorance may understand.
DEBATE = ARGUMENT + SUPPORT, SUPPORT = RESEARCH.

quit applying theories and start applying FACTS.
