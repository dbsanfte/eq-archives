Unfortunately, the vociferous fundamentalists use a single passage in the
New Testament (Matthew 28:16-20) as the springboard for beating everyone
else over the head with their views.  And they tend to get the press by
making huge announcements where they announce that they are trying to
convert all the Jews or boycotting Mickey Mouse.

It is this practice of taking 3 or 4 verse passages and making sweeping
philosophical stands that has driven me away from the church I attended for
years and years.  My wife still goes there, and she takes the kids there ...
but the issues I have are too large to overlook.

Another thing that tends to be a staple of fundamentalists belief is that
Christ is returning soon ... really soon .. like 'maybe day after tomorrow'
soon.  When people honestly believe that the end of the world is neigh, when
everything they see in modern society tends to be viewed through the filter
of Revelation, then they tend to try to walk an even straighter and more
narrow path ... and they become extremely intolerant of those who disagree
with them.

That's just my opinion, of course.  But given that I've just left a Southern
Baptist church, I have seen quite a bit of that philosophy with my own eyes.

fwiw
