Run one of the real time log parsers, have it track tells in another
application window (or another machine if you have that luxury) and toggle
back to that if you miss something.
Personally I do have a second computer so I run it there with it breaking
out, shout, auc, guild, say, and group messages. It is real nice if I go LD
and can't remember the person that sent a tell just as I was crashing etc.
