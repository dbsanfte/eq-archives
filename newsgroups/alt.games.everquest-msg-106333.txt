AHHA "now that many STUPID ASS players have given us the idea."(my
made up quote)
Dumb ass twink alarmists mucking up the game.

From an objective point of view though, you really have to agree that
if any one item should get a nerf its this. Since stats and other
things items can give you hardly matter, in order to make twinking not
be a big deal (from Brad McQuaid, producer of EQ in early 2000 in a
post explainging statistics) that only leaves outrageous items like
the fungi which give a player back hit points faster than he can lose
them. No other item in the game will give any level 1 or above player
who can use it such a boost.

The best reason to make all new fungi drops level 50 or more, would be
to make them affordable for those level 50 or more who want to buy
them. The old ones would then double in price overnight,  making
anyone owning one happy while everyone level 50 or above wanting to
buy one for themselves would be happy.
