It's as much a roleplaying game as you make it. People can turn an IRC
chatroom into a RPG, EQ is FAR better at supporting an RP.

Hmm, I dunno, ignore them?

What's the point of roleplaying, period? Enjoyment. Fun. The
environment itself isn't the only element in roleplay, but the other
roleplayers you choose to play with. I often talk about the RP
guild(s) that I am in on Tunare because they are, by far, the best RP
group I've seen in EQ. I've forsaken levelling for a week at a time
before to roleplay an extended storyline or several storylines that
blend into each other with them.

It's not the environment itself, but the dynamic characters in it that
matter. By "dynamic characters", I don't mean NPCs. PCs, GM controlled
characters, or whatever. ( And if you think the environment in EQ
doesn't change, three words: Kithicor. Runnyeye. Befallen. )

Like I said, it's as much an RPG as you make it. If you choose to play
it hack-n-slash, all it is is hack-n-slash.
