Don't worry about it too much, your stats still sound about on a par with
any Gnome/DE/WoodElf Warrior at startup.
It will make _some_ difference but not a massive amount. I was recently
comparing my 60 HUM WAR to the 60 BAR WAR in my guild. He has maybe 2-300hp
more than I do at the present time but at least half of that is from his
equipment rather than his base stats. I, however, am a mere 20 pts of AC
behind him and he has SoV BP and Legs compared to my Indicolite. My human
has 154 unbuffed STR at 60 (179 self-buffed, 220+ with a shaman) and this is
plenty.
So basically if you aren't prepared to put up with being light a few HP at
level 60 the by all means re-roll the character. Personally I wouldn't
bother ;)
