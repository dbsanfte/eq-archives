As you may, or may not, know...my playing EQ2 is a temporary thing.  To
make a long and boring story short, my husband doesn't want to play EQ2,
but conceded me one month of it for the benefit of the Norrath-based
webcomic I'm writing.

And my time is up in a day...on the 9th. :(

He told me today, though, that as a holiday present to me, and because I
have a big-arse week off at christmas (company is very sweet to us like
that), I can reactivate my account then and he'll play with me and it will
be much sinful, MMORPG lazy fun-ness!

What I can't help but wonder is...*look around*..is he having more fun
himself than he'll admit?  Probably not, but...I'm so glad I can be a
game-glutton over the holidays.  I've ALWAYS wanted to use that week off
for some game or other, and it's never been conveniently timed (relatives
visiting, us going to Maine, etc. etc).  No other game out right now is
doing it for us, so...yeah, YAY!
