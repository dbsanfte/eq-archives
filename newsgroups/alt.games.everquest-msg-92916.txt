Memory .... More Memory .... 512Mb at least

If you don't have much SDRAM in your machine, think about a CPU upgrade too.
You can get an Athlon 1600XP (1.4Ghz) and ECS MoBo K7S5A for $170 -
including shipping (pricewatch). I run that setup with GF3 and 512MB PC2100
and it flys - I play at 1600x1200, full textures, and max clip plane too.
The 1800XP processor is like $25 more.

Your GF2 should be fine, sound card too.
