Some guy in the EC tunnel on the Tholuxe Paells server was saying he was
trying to get 5kpp for an item called "Sow boots" he said they were sold in
Sol A for 5kpp and that they had just been added after the patch. I have
never seen them and 5k seems a bit to much for a merchant to be selling
doesnt it? anyone heard about these. stats?
