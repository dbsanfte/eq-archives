    Thanks for this excellent reply Dan, thanks to you other guys too but
Dan wins the cigar this round ;)

    In answer to the patience thing my 36 SK with int 85 and dex below that
I think made it to fletching 160 or so and I only stopped that because the
best bow I can make is utterly useless to me now (archery needs serious
de-nerfing for it to be useful beyond about lvl 20 - I guess that doesnt
apply to rangers but it sure applies to a human SK). I didnt know how much
difference a high int or alt stat would make then...... now ive read this
post I'm intending on spending a stupid amount of money on the chanter
before i even buy a sharpening stone :)

    What's a geerlok device? Is that something different to the tradeskill
trophy?
