Davian is right here.

You said :
I haven't leveled in a week (3-4 hours a night) since I dinged to 51.

Meaning that you are currently level 51

Then you said :
I spent 6 weeks getting through 54 *flexes* :)

Meaning that at some point you were level 54.

That means either you typ0ed or you suffered 4 levels of death (OWCH!)

I really don't know why your pants are chaffing.
Totally clear now ?
