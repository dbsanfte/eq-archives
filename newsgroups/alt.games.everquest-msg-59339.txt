Agreed.  You can start heading to Iceclad doing Cougar groups around
27 or 28 or even earlier if you have people going with you so you have
a good group.   The money isnt that great on them (none) but they drop
Bloodstained Fangs (20 to 50pp) and Cougar Claw earrings (150 to 250p)
on occasion (prices MT server).  The experience is very nice.  I
picked up 3 yellow at level 33 the other day doing them in a full
group of 28 to 36 chainpulling.  We went 2 solid hours before having
to take a manabreak.  The next day I went with a group with a bit
different makeup (2 Druids, 2 Enchanters, Warrior and Cleric) and I
got a little over 2 yellow at 34 but we did have a bit more often on
the med breaks since the casters would often cast out and I was often
bringing multiple kitties.=)

Great Divide is nice and yes at 28 or so you can do the Tizmaks (I
leave them alone - 1 less mob to watch out for).  You can also get
into Kodiak Cave groups and Dire Wolf/Giant groups.
