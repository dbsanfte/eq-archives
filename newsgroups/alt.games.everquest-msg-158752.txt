>So your gripe is that druids and wizards charged too much?

No, my opinion is not based on a "gripe", nor is it based on the cost
of paying players for ports. 

The fact that Druids/Wizards could make better than decent PP by
porting people around was an obvious flaw in EQ from day 1. I am
amazed it took Sony/Verant this long to address the issue. "Easy
Money" is not part of the vision. Time and time again Sony/Verant has
"nerfed" trade-skill items or turn-in quests that allowed players to
make money with no risk. Porting is no different. In fact you could
easily argue that it was the easiest "Tradeskill" to master (all you
need to do is level a druid to 29-34) and the most profitable (no
material costs).

So the question needs to be asked why did porting for pp grow into
such a huge part of EQ?

The answer is simple. Faster Travel. People want to play EQ, not sit
around waiting for boats or running through huge (mostly empty) zones
(West Karana for example). People are willing to pay for convenience
and to save time. This fact turned a cool "class defining" ability and
a useful utility into a much desired commodity. Thus porting for pp
was born, and with it the creation of the "dRoOd" class. 

The real victims of the situation are true Druids that have been
hounded into going anon by port beggars and are forced to live with
the stigma associated with their class.

That is total BS. I played a Druid for 51 levels. Prior to Luclin I
could make more PP per hour porting than I could fighting 30+ other
people in Rathe Mountains for Hill Giants. By the time I rounded up a
couple of paying customers I had medded back the 300 mana it cost for
the previous group port. It was beyond trivial. It was fun for a
while, but it felt like cheating. I eventually quit the practice and
ported for free whenever I had the time.

For tradeskills you need to farm dropped items, or run zone to zone
buying from lowbies. Failures on combines are always a net loss, and
as mentioned above Sony/Verant has made sure that tradeskills are not
profitable. Tradeskills are "nerfed" enough as it is. It would take
months (maybe even years) selling at grandmaster levels to recoup the
cost of skilling up. Even the highest level items are barely sold
above the cost of components.

You completely miss the point. It was never the "fault" of the people
selling the service. The fault lies with the shortsightedness of
Sony/Verant, and the fact that they failed to realize how important
fast travel was to the player base. 

Non-Port travel is extremely tedious in EQ and is not "fun". Why do
you think so many players despise Druids? Part of it is class envy
(Druids really are an amazing class), and part of it is the fact that
paying your local druid was the lesser of two evils. Better than
wasting 30-45mins travelling, but certainly not a "fun" thing to do.
There is a HUGE underlying resentment towards druids, because of their
monopoly on fast travel. (Wizards get off the hook because they were
broken so long few people played them or whored them out as port
mules).

I have a 51 Druid on one of my 3 accounts. I have nothing to be
envious of. Travel was never a problem for me or any of my characters.
That being said the "flaw" I described above has always been obvious
to me. Sure I made money porting (until I abandoned the practice long
before Luclin), but that doesn't mean the system wasn't flawed or that
I couldn't see it with my own eyes.

I didn't throw him away. I just don't play him anymore. Want to know
why? Here's a little hint........I haven't needed a "port-mule" since
the release of Luclin.

No one was "nerfed" by the release of PoP or Luclin. Every spell in a
druids book still works the same as ever (except for Harmany :-/ )

Only the port-whores have reason to complain, and as stated before, I
have no sympathy for them.
