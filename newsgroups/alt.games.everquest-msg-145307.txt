Not THAT way, you freaking bunch of circus posse perverts.

I got the new flappy yesterday. (Level 54 wizard "pet" if you can call
it that.)  Plus 20 to all resists, FT2, and finally a new graphic. He
looks just like a drake, instead of that stupid imp graphic.

I'm still smiling about it.

No... I guess I didn't have any fucking point to this post at all.

/sigh
