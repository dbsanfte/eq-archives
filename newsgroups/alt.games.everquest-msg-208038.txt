I didn't see Carbon's original post; my news server didn't carry it.  I'm
obviously posting an opposite opinion.  As I said, if you take thirty
seconds to edit the key with which zoneline you're heading for, it's not a
waste of time.  If you just got to the zone to fight in, you're probably
going to be medding up thirty seconds after you pre-fight buff yourself
anyway.

You talk of taking responsibility for yourself.  Fine.  Let's talk
responsibility.  If a train flattens a group and no shout was called, it is
the Trainer's responsibility.  If train was called and they didn't get out
of the way, it's the Trainee's responsibility - both in my opinion, of
course.

And, lastly - common courtesy isn't.  It's often not courtesy, and it's
certainly not common any more.
