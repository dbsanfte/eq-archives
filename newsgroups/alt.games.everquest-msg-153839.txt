As Bizbee mentioned: you ran into a group of fucking idiots. I have started
grouping recently on a baby druid (23 now) and I do not find it as enjoyable
as soloing. There is an induced stress from resposibility/performance and it
seems less like fun and more like hard work.

Even things like taking a piss and getting a fresh beer took planning.

For people who find grouping fun - all the more power to 'em. I find it more
enjoyable to help people from out of group. Drive by heals, damage sheilds,
cures etc. All the fun, most of the socialising but none of the
responsibility.
