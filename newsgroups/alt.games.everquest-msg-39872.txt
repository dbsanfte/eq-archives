Hasn't DAOC been in beta for a year? Verant was in full spin mode by
then. Monolith actually have an online RPG that has been running for
over a decade on AOL, and they've still managed to keep their
integrity. Maybe they'll turn into Verant, maybe not -- I'll be the
first to pitch a bitch when and if they start becoming as incompetent
and downright dishonest as Verant and Funcom. But as of now, they seem
to be head-and-shoulders above the rest in terms of customer support.
