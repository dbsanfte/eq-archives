So, a significant portion of the potential buying pool will completely
disregard the new zones, the new graphics (OK, personally I am not
buying anything that makes gnomes look like halflings) and the new
race, because they can't make a pure caster character with the new
race? Perhaps I should be huffy because I can't make a good character
Iksar.

What would be the point of demanding all types be represented?

Other races having beastlords could be explained by shamans or
whatever going to the moon, learning about the beastlords, and
bringing the teachings back to their own people.

Racial swimming is a no no. Very high agility.
