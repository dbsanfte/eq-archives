I like the fact that necro's have less down time (with mana regen) but as a
recently DING'd lvl 34 druid who is experimenting with quad kiting you
cannot beat the exp if you find a good spawn spot. Last night I was quading
the gnolls that roam the hill in SK and getting at least an entire blue
bubble per quad with no risk to me.  But that can be a long spawn depending
on how busy the spires are. I also tri-kite the crazed goblins in BB for
great exp as well. MY WIS is only 142 and I can do it as long as I get no
resists. I found the bad part of quad kiting is lag, I died so fast my
computer just didn't realize it.
