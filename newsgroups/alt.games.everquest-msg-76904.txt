With my Druid, who is level 7, the money was made mainly from batwings
and bonechips and CB belts.  I simply banked them and waited.
Eventually you hear "WTB Bone Chips - paying 5pp per stack" or the
same for Bat Wings.  These items arent in nearly the same supply in
Gfay as they are in say EC as a rule.  The CB Belts which normally run
1pp on the server the Druid is on fetch 3pp from me due to volume.  I
wait to sell until I have at least 40 to 50 of them banked.  If you
want them you will pay extra for the benefit of getting that many all
at once.

With my cleric it was a combination of silk threads and animal pelts.
She has been fortunate enough to have hit a fair number of HQ Bear
Skins which sell for 20pp on that server.  I think she has managed to
loot 6 of them by level 7 for a nice 120pp.  The silk threads she will
simply hook up with an aspiring smith who wants to make leather
padding but hates hunting spiders.  She was getting exp for the
spiders as well as 10 to 20pp per stack for silk threads.  It adds up
pretty quick.  When she gets a bit older (which will be eons from now
as I just dont really play anyone but my main for the most part) she
will earn money from Silk Swatches as well which go for a minimum of
40pp on that server.  

There is a lot of money to be had, you just have to know where to
look.  I recently ran into a young warrior who at level 9 had hardly
anything on and wanted to know if I had anything she could do to earn
money.  I told her what I need (spiderling silk and pelts) and told
her to save them for me and told her what they were worth to me.  We
will see if she comes thru.  If she does, I will likely advance her
the money to buy some armor although I told her if she gets me MQ or
HQ Cat pelts I will make her some armor.

As someone once stated, everyone twinks to a certain degree as you
cannot forget what you learned on the way up and you use that
knowlege.
