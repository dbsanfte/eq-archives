I escorted one of our warriors to EK last night for scale & hand turn
in. He accidentally turned in his spiroc blade instead of the hand. I
had to log before he got in touch with the server GM (he got his items
back :) ) but he was so upset when he found out what he'd done he
talked about quitting the game if he'd have to get the items over
again.
