I'm surprised they said anything at all in the patcher. Historically, 
SOE has always communicated via their official boards whenever there 
were server downtime issues. Did you play EQ1 prior to EQ2? At least 
that is what I have seen in the year I have been playing EQ1. In any 
case, where they did use the patcher to make an announcement I can see 
why people would expect further word to come from the same place. On the 
other hand, if no further word was forthcoming after a reasonable amount 
of time I know I would have gone to the boards looking for it if I was 
anxious to play. It does seem reasonable that one might expect a company 
to use their official message forums to communicate with their users. 
Just my two coppers, or whatever the cheapest coin in EQ2 is. I just 
installed my copy today. I'm glad I didn't bother to try to log in with 
it as I had other things to do preparing for the upcoming holidays. lol...

It is a little frustrating sometimes when a game you pay for and love to 
play or even just want to check out is unavailable unexpectedly and for 
some unknown amount of time. But such is the nature of the beast with 
complex software systems. I worked in software development (in testing 
mostly, although I did some programming as well) and I have to tell you 
that I marvel at how reliable these games are in general. In a year of 
playing EverQuest there really has been very little unanticipated 
downtime. Personally, I think SOE's record is pretty good in terms of 
reliability at least with that game. And I have a lot of playtime so I 
am on often at all hours of the day and night. I think I have seen the 
Stromm server crash once when I happened to be logged in. The better 
part of my guild was fighting under water for a drop somebody needed for 
something too when it happened. Oh, well. I can live with that. Stuff 
happens.

Having said that, I do have to note that I found it humorous they were 
patching the patch again recently. But as one person above said, shit 
happens. And in software development with its high degree of complexity 
it really is kind of amazing that shit doesn't happen more often than it 
does. I know from having spent so much time in a test environment that 
try as you may, no matter how diligently and carefully you work, you 
simply cannot anticipate every possible scenario when software goes 
live. It isn't humanly possible, at least not at this point in time. Of 
course, there are times when marketing drives a company to release code 
before it should and you can fault a company for that I would agree. But 
the fact is, you could test software for years and still not touch every 
line of code in it in every possible way. So yes, things do happen and 
as a PC user who's used them for as long as they have existed I have 
learned to accept that there is no perfection.

So when the servers go down I don't get all worked up about it even if I 
do feel dissapointed that I cannot play. I don't know about you guys but 
as much as I enjoy EverQuest, I do have other games to play when it 
isn't available, which again in my experience over the past year has not 
been that often.

Sometimes when I read angry and bitter whining complaining bitching 
posts over games I wish I could reach out into the ether and just shake 
the person bitching. Do you realize how completely unimportant this is 
in the grand scheme of things? Does it occur to you that life is too 
short to get upset and raise your own blood pressure over a game when 
there are so many to choose from? I mean even if your PC blows up and 
your console melts down, life is still pretty damned good isn't it? I 
left software development to return to nursing where I care for people 
who are dying. Let me tell you, it really helps me keep things in 
perspective when I spend time caring for them. I guess what I am saying 
is don't sweat the small stuff because it is just small stuff. Really 
small stuff. It's just a game. Don't like it? Play a different one. 
Don't like a particular company? Never buy thier products or play any of 
them. Play something else instead. UO ain't the only game in town 
anymore. There's plenty to choose from.

Did SOE piss you off today? Well don't let them do it again. Cancel your 
account and go play WoW. But I'm telling you right now that Blizzard and 
every other game software developer under the sun is going to make 
mistakes. Every MMO will have downtime including unexpected downtime. Do 
yourself a favor and accept that the world isn't perfect and you'll live 
longer and be happier too.

Sorry, but I get pretty tired of seeing threads like this when there are 
so many positives to focus on instead. I remember when Flight Simulator 
was kind of it for games and you could count the polygons on your 
fingers. Todays computer entertainment is amazing in contrast to those 
days. The virtual worlds we have to play in are just incredible. 
Personally, I think it's a lot more fun and enjoyable to talk about the 
good things in them and share stories and advice on playing better and 
such. People waste way too much time bitching about stuff they really 
haven't got a clue about. The current crop of MMORPGs are technical 
marvels folks. It should come as no surprise that there will be some 
problems in beta, during launch, after patches and occasionally at 
completely unexpected times. You try coding something better and more 
reliable. I'd like to play it.

By the way, for some software that is truly excellent and highly 
reliable see the shameless plug and check the links below for Mozilla apps.
