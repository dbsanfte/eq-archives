I've never felt *harassed* by either.  If I'm in a group or busy I just say so.
 I've never had anyone pressure me *ever*.  If this *were* to happen, said
player would be added to my ignore list.  
That said, I will knock myself out to rez someone or port someone IF I can. 
And I've never once *set a price* for ports, and I don't take money for rezzes.
 Maybe I'm just lucky.  I never advertise buffs for donations, but when asked I
willingly do so.  Please remember, a dot costs 10 plat plus change.
