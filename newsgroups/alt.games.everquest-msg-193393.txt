If you're afraid of what will happen if mezz is resisted, try root, mez.  If
mezz doesn't work (if you're not using GOK or Apathy on red critters you
should be) then tash and try again.

Meanwhile, with the critter rooted, a friend of mine created a macro that
says "%t is ROOTED.  That means MOVE AWAY unless you want hit!"
