Well, I made a really, really silly move last night.  I had been ToV 
farming with my guild and decided it was time to call it a night, so asked 
for a TL out.  I have an armor MQ to complete in Kael, so I asked for a TL 
to Wakening Lands.  Just as I hit the confirm box I realize that I have 
made a classis tactical error; heading into a possibly deadly area without 
Selos memmed.  I was hitting my book hotkey constantly, and immediately 
upon loading I was staring at my book and memming Selos.  
I get blasted by AE, look up, and see the cursed dragon Wuoshi standing 
on top of me, trying to make me a snack.  I know there is no way that I 
got Selos memmed in that short time between zone load and AE blast, but 
sure enough, the gem is loaded and ungreyed (thank you for fixing bard 
song memorization times Verant!), so I fire it up and run like 
a very frightened bard (I'm good at that).  I get a bit of distance on the 
scaly bastard, swap in a drum, and shout that he's on my ass and heading 
to Kael.  I zone, click the BP a time or two to top off health, and tell 
the guild that he's up.  
The guild decides that ToV is pretty much done for the night, and that we 
might as well kill Wuoshi, so I go out to keep the portal clear.  For some 
reason Wuoshi is now sitting in front of Kael, near whatever it is those 
Giants are alwasy trying to build there.  I sat watching him, until he 
warped back near his spawn point, and then I took him on a long, scenic 
tour of the zone, while letting my guild port in. 
The guild ported in, ran to Kael to buff, and I ran at warp speed to zone 
and clear aggro.  I clear aggro, zone back out, and find Wuoshi is camping 
the Kael zone, which makes no sense since I can run BACKWARDS much faster 
than he can chase me, and I've run from almost the SS zone to get some 
distance.  Anyway, I pull him away from zone a bit, people zone out, and 
we start fighting right in front of Kael.  We quickly realize the error of 
our ways as we're all stunned, unable to attack, unable to cast, taking 
a decent amount of damage, and the Giants are now starting to help Wuoshi 
(probably an accidental AE).  We zone back to Kael, regroup, and get ready 
to try again.  
This time I and another bard kite him around manadraining while the guild 
gets in position.  The tell me that they're ready, and I start tracking to 
them, and am immediately stunned by a passing panther, and eaten by 
Wuoshi.  Luckily the other bard was able to pull him in, so I watched the 
entire fight in /guildchat nekkid.  The fight lasted probably 4-5 minutes, 
several times longer than any previous Wuoshi fight.  Everyone had PR over 
255, and MR well over 255, yet were still stunned and useless for most of 
the fight.  
We lost two people other than me in the fight, but I really think this 
fight was more difficult than Klandicar.  Was Wuoshi recently buffed, did 
we have a bad streak on the RNG, did we overlook something basic that we 
never overlooked before?  
Anyway, even with the annoying 30-second stuns we got a couple middling 
toys and kept the vital transportation hub clear of nasty dragons.  I also 
proved that it IS possible to port into Wuoshi, unsowed and unselod, and 
survive.
