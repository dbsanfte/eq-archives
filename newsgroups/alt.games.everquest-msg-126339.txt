The chimp has been saving up carefully and has finally pieced together a
kitty of just over 9Kpp for his baby sister bard and is currently wondering
what to go shopping for.

She is currently decked out in odds and ends the Chimp has collected on his
travels with a few items snapped up from auction as well. Not much is
optimised for a bard, ie, most of it is chain class and not plate which I
guess is where the major problem lays.

I was thinking of getting hold of a Iksar Ceremonial Breastplate for the
regen effect first of all but I have not had much experience on plate
classes yet - is the 19ac goign to cause problems? I have the mandatory Neth
Chit breastplate rotting in the bank of course, but no self respecting bard
would wear a plate look breast plate with all other items chain look, so I
guess getting rid of chain items without going backwards is pretty important
as well. Bards <do> have to keep some modicum of dress sense at least ; )
The weapons are more than adequate for the time being though.

I had a look at the Lambent gear but that seems decidely outdated AC wise,
so I guess I just need something to tide me over till I can work on the
twightlight quest armour. Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

Also, the Bard is wood elf and believe it or not I was stupid enough not to
add stamina at creation so +sta items are regarded very favorably. Currently
only 80 stamina with items and running out of wind during fights is quite
common already. I am considering remaking her on this point alone.
