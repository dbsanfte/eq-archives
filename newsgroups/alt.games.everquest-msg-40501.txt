Is there a definitive list of how many levels below your level mobs will
remain "blue" to you at various levels?  We were killing time before a
guild event by hanging out in Oasis killing spectres this weekend. I
noticed that about half of them were blue, the rest green.  Specs
allegedly run 33 to 37.  So at lvl 47 I was guessing that I "greened
out" at about level 35 mobs. This got me thinking about the question, as
this will be an important factor in deciding what to hunt and where
later on. And will it remain constant, or does the spread keep
increasing. Twelve levels worth of blues seems like a lot to me.
   And lastly, I didn't once get a green where I got xp. Have I outgrown
the "high green" stage where you ocassionally get xp and skill increases
on borderline greens from here on out? Or was that just random bad luck?
