Yea.  Spell Haste is good. It's not godly, but it's good.  Thing is, as 
you get closer to elementals, you're going to get a -lot- of opportunities 
for a Spell Haste item, so I wouldn't devote a lot of time to specifically 
seeking one out.  Ornate Boots may be really easy, though, they were down 
in the 5-10K range on my server last I checked.  If you can get that FT in 
another slot, that could be a nice upgrade.

Also keep in mind that you only really need spell haste for detrimental 
spells.  People waiting another 2 seconds for buffs ain't gonna hurt much, 
but getting the mob mezzed 1/2 a second faster can be a big deal.  So the 
"*** of Solusek" spell haste items may be good for you.  Leave the "*** of 
Mithaniel" for the healers.  My personal favorite of the three spell haste 
items I've ended up with is Gauntlets of the Burning Prince.  They truly 
truly kick major butt. :)
