It's much funner to take the piss out of attractive people anyway :D 
Unattractive people are used to comments (ie, my next door neighbor, who 
is about 3 times as big as I am, once commented on how it must be 
unfortunate how I couldn't get a good job due to my weight.  Uh... wha?)

To make us certain they went to some "models online" site and stole the 
pictures? :)  I like the guy who did one picture of himself in negative.  
"Look, I'm even hot when I'm blue!  Right?"

I think the one that disturbed me most was the chick with the mirror 
over her bed.  ::eyes it::  And I'm fairly sure that's just a bra she's 
wearing in the third picture...
