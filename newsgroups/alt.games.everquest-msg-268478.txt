Hooked on Phonics has really gotten a bad rap over the past while (most
probably due to those jackass-stupid commercials).  In fact, if you were to
check, you'd find that pretty much everyone in this newsgroup (who's over
40, anyway) learned how to read phonetically.

The two main methods of reading are phonetic, where you sound out the
individual letters and pattern-match variations in sound until you come up
with a match, and wholistic, where you attempt to learn the pronunciation of
the word as a whole by it's context in the sentence.

Now, as context does not give pronunciation guides, the wholistic method
falls on it's face immediately.  But, when I was heading into junior high
and high school, that's what was catching on in the elementary schools.

Instead of going through rote "A is apple, Abe, awful, B is Baby, C is
Carrot, civil...", the educators (they weren't teaching, they were
educating) felt that it was less of an imposition on the little darlings if
they could proceed at their own pace and learn words in context instead of
being force-fed a bunch of sounds and having to learn which letter could
represent which sound(s).

If I give you the word "antediluvianism" you may not know what it means but,
if you've learned phonetics, you'll have a very good chance of getting the
correct pronunciation.
