Then you're not there for experience, correct, you are there for Cazic?

And presumably for the items which he drops, not the experience gain from
killing him.

To use your phase...  I know what experience you get there in a two group
clearing of the zone.

The point is it's still peanuts compared to the rate I was gaining in a 6
person group in Siren's Grotto.  While I haven't been that far, I hear Dragon
Necropolis is even faster,  assuming your group is powerful enough to survive
there.   So, I'd still contend that anyone going to Fear just for experinece
gain is being a little bit stupid and quite a bit selfish, considering the are
taking the Plane from a lesser guild who could actually use the armor drops,
rather than letting them go to rot.   Uberguilds have other options.
