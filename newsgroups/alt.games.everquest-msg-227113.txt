I have 2 different 128 mb radeon 9600 pro's. One from ATI, one from...
Sapphire? Anyway, the variations between them are so small as to be within
the margin of error for the benchmark (meaning they've they have both won).
They also both work fine with the generic ATI drivers.

The only think I know to look out for is that there is one company (not
visiontek) that puts out nearly a dozen cards based on the 9600/9600pro, but
their clock speeds and ram speeds vary widely, so you have to be very
careful.
If it were me, I would definatly go with the 9200SE 128 MB. I assume PCI
because you don't have an AGP slot?
Unfortunatly, I am not familiar with VisionTek directly.
