I always found casting rune on tanks in combat creates way too much aggro, I
normally use beserker spirit but in the situation descibed that would have
cycled far too slowly to be of use. Hope you got some plat/gems at least to
cover the use of God knows how many peridots...I don't imagine Rune 3 would
last more than 2 hits, up there.
