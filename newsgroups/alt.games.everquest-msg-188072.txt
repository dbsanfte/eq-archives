Actually, the MT has a personal interest in keeping the cleric alive
-- the cleric's death DIRECTLY endangers his own life and the lives of
the rest of the group.

I still say restoration of lost xp when the loss of xp wasn't in any
way the cleric's fault is a courtesy.

Of course, after all I've said, in a cleric's place, I wouldn't refuse
to rez a group mate. The worst I would do is grant a lower % or even a
0% rez to get the person back to the group if they've been acting like
a complete tool...
