I have retired my main, and have started playing a mage (twinked) and am
level 10 now. I am wondering what minimum level is for Paludual. I can solo
yellows in Nro now without any problems. I'm wanting to know if I can go at
12 when I get new pet or maybe wait until 16. TIA for help
btw if you would like to see my gear my magelo is,

The reason my int is not higher is because of my hp and mana items.
