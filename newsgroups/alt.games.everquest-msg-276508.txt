I should add that at this point, I rarely play EQ1 at all to XP anyway, 
mostly I just log on for guild raids any more, so, the changes will 
actually have minimal impact directly on me at this point, unless they 
actually somehow make shaman more viable for groups, and I find that 
going LFG or trying to put together a group from the maybe dozen others 
that are LFG (usually including at least 2 other level 70 shaman, zero 
clerics, zero druids, and an assortment of necros, mages, the odd 
enchanter, and sometimes tanks) suddenly becomes easier.
