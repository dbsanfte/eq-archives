Well, there are (at least) 356k characters (one of my
characters is at position 356,617 on the "most deaths" list on
eq2players.com), and with 4 characters per account, that's a minimum
of about 90k accounts.  One of the mods also said there were 170k
accounts, IIRC, sometimes in first week, but I can't find it with a
simple search and can't be arsed to trawl through all those posts (I
think it was Faarwolf, if anyone is really that interested).

If characters are removed from the eq2players.com listings once the
account goes inactive (should be easy to check once the free month is
over, for all those who don't like the game), then we will always be
able to establish a reasonable lower bound on the number of accounts,
at least until they start allowing more characters.
