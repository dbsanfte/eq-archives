Haven't you learned yet that 30 Verant minutes is WAY different than
real time? Of course, that depends on which side of the "emergency"
patch you are on. Before the server goes down, time runs much faster,
then after the server is down, time runs much slower. I believe the
latest edition of Stephen Hawking's "A brief history of time" has an
appendix on this anomoly. =p
