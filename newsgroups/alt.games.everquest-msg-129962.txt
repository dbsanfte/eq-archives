All you have to do is say a key phrase to GM Glox and he ports you down
there, can do it at level 1 even.  BUT unless using spoiler sites, you
shouldn't know the phrase until you do the earlier quests, which you can't
generally do until you're powerful enough to handle Glox down there.

BTW, level 16 necro also works.
