Hi:

I'm about to add an EverQuest section to my personal Website, and would like
to use the EQ gem images (the ones in the eight gem slots for casting
spells) to my pages. I've seen a download for these on the Internet ages
ago, but sadly I'm not having any success in locating them again. Ideally,
I'd like to have a high-quality image (1024*768) for each gem that
represents a different spell type - I've tried playing /gems and taking a
screenshot of the gems in the hope of editing them out in photo editing
software, but sadly, my screen capture isn't that great.

Many thanks to you all .. safe hunting ..

Stevie.
