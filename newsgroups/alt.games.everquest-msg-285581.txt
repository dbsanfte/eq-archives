I may have just missed these, but I don't see:

Group Hug: Move close to the caster, or move close to your group leader, 
an incoming spell will hit everyone in group if in range of the target. 
  May apply to buffs, or to heals, or to cures, or for a port or evac. 
Or the speaker could just be overly friendly.

Huddle: See group hug

Evac: a group port, which might be to certain zones which don't have 
normal group ports, or might be to the zone line.  Under calm 
circumstances, this is simply a transportation mode, although it still 
calls for a "group hug" so as to avoid being left behind.  Note also 
that this spell line includes a chance of leaving people behind even 
when in range, and will definately leave you if you are running Divine 
Aura or Harmshield.

EVAC!: as an exclamation, this refers to the use of an evac, almost 
always to the "succor point" in the zone, to escape impending disaster. 
  Used by the porter, it is a call for a group hug, and to go to all 
lengths to keep aggro off the caster so the spell can go off, used by 
anyone else in the group, it is a call for the porter to cast her evac 
spell.   Used in a group without a porter, it is a call to begin making 
out your will.

GO GO GO: command to EVAC!  unfortunately also used as a command to 
attack a mob, hopefully you'll figure it out in context.
