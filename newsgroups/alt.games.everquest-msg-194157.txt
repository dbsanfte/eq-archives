Tarnation seems to stick to lots of mobs that will shrug off other stuns.

Other than high end or "immune to stun" mobs that aren't, though, all stuns seem
to resist about the same...

Except that Stun (the no damage one) seems to actually be resisted -less- than
other stuns, possibly because there's only one chance to resist it instead of
two.

I have a hotkey

/cast 1
/cast 2
/cast 3

where spells are
Stun
Holy Might
Force

This always casts the cheapest available stun; if Stun is available it casts
that and then won't do the other two (giving message "you can't do that while
casting a spell).  If Stun is down but Holy Might is available, it says "that
spell is not ready" casts Holy Might, and then gives the "you can't do that
message" about Force.  If both Stun and Holy Might are greyed out, then it casts
Force.

Even if clicking the hotkey as fast as the "all greyed out" cycles I'll rarely
get a situation where all three are grey.  Using "stun when target starts
casting" I'll usually only cast stun with occaisional Holy Might's

Something else to do is to get a good shield (or a crappy one, but might as well
have good stats in every slot) and bash bash bash.  Max out this skill and you
have a decent shot at interrupting casts with it without spending any mana at
all, and it works on many stun immune mobs.

The damage on the various stuns is just an insult, by the time you get a damage
stun its impossible for anyone who isn't twinked to the high heavens to kill
any  blue mob with the stun damage you get, even blowing a full bar on the
project.  Damage to mana ratio is terrible on them.  Stun (the level  5 no
damage one) sticks better, is cheaper, and as a bonus, won't break mez (often
I'm stunning a mob so it will stop beating a chanter long enough for him to mez
it.  If his mez sticks before my stun hits, a no damage stun won't blow things,
but a damage stun will make me look a total git!)

Bergh
ps oh and while we are at it, Root and Flash of Light are better for most uses
than their higher level "upgrades".
