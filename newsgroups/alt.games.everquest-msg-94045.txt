I believe it does. There are supposedly three separate checks in an ID
attempt. First, the ID skill, then the kick has to land (which presumably is
dependent upon your Kick skill), then the Fear spell has to land.

How the ID skill level figures into that process, I haven't seen a good
explanation of. What I have read seems to indicate that there are 3 separate
checks involved. I'd be happy to see something substantive to the contrary,
or that explains the sequence better. But I suppose the only person who
really knows is the guy who worked on that segment of the game code. There's
a lot of hearsay out there that somewhat obfuscates game mechanics issues...
