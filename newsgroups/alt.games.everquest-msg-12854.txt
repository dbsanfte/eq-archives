I'm not trying to get anyone to like it. And for RP'ers it must surely
grate. I just don't see it as a bad thing.

I'm sure some of the people (kids) who use it are just as bright as the
average EQ player. Every age group has their own way of speaking, and I'm
sure that if the plz'ers knew how much it annoyed the older ones, it would
only add to their enjoyment of doing so.
