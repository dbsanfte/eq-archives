1. There are no faction issues from a druid (or cleric) killing animals,
unless the animal is on a specific faction, ie "your faction with wolves of
norrath has gotten worse"
2. GOTO 1
3. Normal animals will attack:
   a) Anyone that they would normally agro
   b) Anyone who is sitting down.

NOTE: Normal animals wont attack druids and rangers in this way.

4. Not unless you hit the wolf, or  healed or buffed the cleric. NPC druids
at the rings dont like you to attack wolves (probably bears as well), where
they can see you doing it.
