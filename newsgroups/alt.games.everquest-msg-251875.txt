My guild is basically casual. We have no obligations towards the guild
but we do raid 4-5 nights a week (weekends are mostly for exping,
adventures, quests, trying new zones etc). Our current level is
farming VT and knocking on EP's door (only RZ and SolRo to go).

For most raids my raidleaders normally look around in the guildtool if
there are enough people online for a raid. If there are a raidcall is
given in guildchat and via guildmotd (to notify people who log in what
is going on). 
As soon as there are enough people in the zone we drop a few basic
buffs on the maingroups and start clearing to whatever we are going
for.
Latecomers are cohed in (we have 1 or 2 dedicated coh groups
normally).
We have 5 raid-able mages, and usually within the first 10 min of a
raidcall a mage is present, we have an account of which all the
raidleaders and officers know the login with a magebot who can be
logged in by one of the duoboxers if for some reason no mages are
online.

If no coh or running behind is possible, like with agnarr, or
impractical we wait 30 min max after the raidcall. MGB's are fired
around the 20 min mark so the buffers can med up to full before we go
in. Around the 30 min mark we ask if anyone is still moving to the
raid. If so and are close enough we wait, otherwise they're out of
luck (doesn't happen often after the first 2 or 3 times you do this).

We are still a friendly and casual guild, but we can race any other
guild pretty well (and we did outrace several, even when they cheated
by breaking server agreements).

My guild is dutch-only. Maybe that's why we're so good ;).
