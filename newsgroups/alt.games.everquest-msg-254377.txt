If the guy has done all this then he's *not* clueless, can probably keep agro
because he has his taunt skill up, and will for *sure* be hitting the mob.  
We'd let him tank.  Of course this is a *totally* different guy than was
described in the original post.....
OTOH, I've been totally frustrated in groups, having to cast 2 complete heals
on a warrior in one round is a great way to get agro, and not being able to sit
down and med sucks.
It sucks even more to have to say every 10 minutes *oom hold pulls* because
agro is ping ponging all over the place so not only am I healing the MT and the
ST I have to heal the chanter and the wizard too and *no one* can sit down and
med.  It's nerve wracking and dangerous, and shouldn't be ignored because you
don't want to hurt the warriors feelings.  
(Of course this scenario is a *lot* different than the Original Post too but
we're off on a rant).
I feel guilty when there's alot of downtime due to me medding.  And sometimes
I'm sure the problem could be that *my* cleric just has an insufficient mana
pool for *my* level.  In a group of friends or a LDON I'd tough it out.  In a
group of strangers I'd find a replacement for *myself*.  That's what *I* would
do.
