Yet that is what you try to do.. very ethical.

The millions of people who have died may not care, but their families
and friends despise stupidity like that.

Which describes that your immune system has been severely weakened or
even
destroyed by the HIV virus.

Nonsense. Official figures indicate that the fight against AIDS is
working in the US, and the numbers across the board are dropping.
Though it is still the leading cause of death among African Americans
ages 25-44 (perhaps that is why you try and discard it, eh? Who cares
about them blackies - but then that is the tone of this entire thread
isn't it?!)

Yet you just claimed the list was growing. Ho ho.

HIV destroys the immune system. Ergo,  the symptom of  a decease is
the seam weather you have HIV or not, the indication that you have
active HIV is that you get a truck load of decease&#8217;s all the
time.


> HIV is a retrovirus and unremarkable in this regard.

No, its the Human Immunodeficiency Virus - is a virus that kills your
body's "CD4 cells." CD4 cells  help your body fight off infection and
disease(CD4 cells are also called T-helper cells).

Those rare circumstances being, having sex with Someone who is HIV
infected,  sharing drug injection needles with another person. It also
can be passed from a mother to her baby when she is pregnant, when she
delivers the baby, or if she breast-feeds her baby.

If you are very luck.

Serious readers beware, all those links are to minority groups who
vehemently believe that there is an evil conspiracy trying to deceive
the world into think that AIDS is dangerous, when in fact it really
isn&#8217;t. (The millions that have died probably had a traffic
accident  or something.)

Here are some links which do not see the world though X-Files eyes:

http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/dhap.htm
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_533000/533475.stm
http://gbgm-umc.org/africa/aidsafri.html
http://www.unaids.org/


Of course if it ultimately boils down to "we only care if it affects
US" , the people in this thread can argue the numbers are on their
side:

The United Nations health program on AIDS (UNAIDS)estimates that
10.000 children in the US are HIV positive (in 2001), Compared to the
250.000 children in South Africa.

And even the fact that the number of children who have been orphaned
(children being below 15 years of age) number 660.000 we can rest
assured it must be the flu or something.
