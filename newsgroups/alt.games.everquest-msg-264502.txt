    I wonder if this can lead to a griefing tactic.  GriefMachine runs up
to a desirable mob, smacks it, then /yells and trains it onto someone
else.  The victim is forced to waste time and energy killing it, while
GriefMachine runs off and does it again.  Could also be used to screw over
people who are camping a particular mob for a quest drop.

   I hope I am wrong, and if I am not, that people will be well behaved
enough not to do this.  But I have played EQ for a while, and I have to
admit that my faith on this subject might be a bit thin.
