What is also interesting is that commonly voiced among the members of the
EQ2 community who quit EQ-L is a sentiment that PoP was when they quit
because it ruined the game for them (though Luclin is often mentioned as
the beginning of their downward spiral).  For someone to say that PoP was
the *best* expansion shows how this was certainly a devisive point in the
games history.  Hasn't it been said that it was a time when you saw a lot
of people quitting balanced by an influx of new members?  I remember
reading that somewhere.  We are most certainly dealing with very different
"breeds" of gamers.

Anyhow, I agree with everything you say about the awesome-ness of Velious
and the not-so-awesome-ness of PoP.
