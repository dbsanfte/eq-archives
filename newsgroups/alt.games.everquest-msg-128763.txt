VI does occassionally set the MOTD to say something about the language
filter <not> being an excuse for foul language, so it's hardly
surprising that they (presumably) make an effort to train the GMs and
Guides not to say anything stupid like that.  OTOH, I have twice had
a guide suggest that I use /ignore when I reported offensive speech
(not simple vulgarities, but extremely offensive racial/ethnic slurs
coupled with threatened violence, both times on ooc).  Both of the
offending characters disappearred shortly afterwards (same day) and
did not reappear anytime I was on in the month or so it took me to
get around removing them from my friend list (needed: "/who all ignore"
to make it easier to keep an eye on dickheads) so perhaps the Guides
eventually bumped the complaint up to a GM (or others complained and
were answered by a more useful Guide, who knows).

Only person I know of who was suspended (banned actually) for language
was a PK moron (i.e. he was a PK, and he also was a moron) who had just
been reinstated from a suspension for harassment and spewed a bunch
of obscenities at a GM investigating another harassment complaint
against him.  The GM actually announced his banning server-wide (this
was less than six months after EQ first went live, iirc).
