I've actually done this once or twice. I look for mid 30's druids in
EC, figuring they have to be there raising money, and I offer them
100pp+, very politely, with a "Of course, I understand entirely if
you're too busy or dont feel like it".

So far none of them have complained... think I've maybe done it
3 times in 3 years (one of those "OMG I need a port NOW" moments),
twice to druids, once to a wizard.

I was amazed they were as friendly as they were, actually ;) Still,
I suppose an unanon druid in EC is pretty much screaming "pay taxi
for hire" in some ways ;)

Why do I only look for mid 30's druids? They're the ones with ports
to places I wanted to go for whom anything I could feasibly offer
for a port (at those times) had meaningful enough value to be
worth interrupting their time.
