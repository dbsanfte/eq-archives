Did you even play EQ 1 when it first came out? It took people two months to
get to level 30! I'm sure EQ2 has a better balance of equipment, too.
Meaning a twink warrior won't have too much of an advantage over a
nontwinked one. That's where EQ1 went wrong, everyone had a twink gaining 25
levels per day and making all the 'newbs' feel like they were just wasting
their time. The reason levels go so fast in EQ1 is because everyone knows
the best way to level and there are higher levels to buff the hell out of
you, even if it is just temp. I suppose you remember Hell Levels in eq1?
Surely they implimented those into the sequel, maybe the reason it takes you
400 kills instead of 60 is because now every 5 levels after 10 is a hell
level instead of every 5 after 30. Seeing as how my comp is too crappy to
play EQ2 I have no experience with it and these thoughts are probably all
100% wrong, but they are damn good speculation!
