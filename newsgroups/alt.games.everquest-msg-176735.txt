You know, people often joke about this, but Repetitive Stress Disorder
(aka Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) is potentially a very serious problem.
I know a woman who has a bad case, and sometimes she has to go for
days on end without using her wrists for anything, and that includes
using the computer.  She's facing the possibility of surgery, with
no guarantee that it will help at all.

I'm a big fan of tradeskills myself, although I've only recently begun
the seriously click-intensive ones (smithing and tailoring).  If you
think Minotaur Hero's Brew is rough at 9 items, wait until you're making
something like Wu's fighting tunics.  It's also a 9-item combine, but
four of those items (heady kiolas) are themselves 3-item combines, and
three of those items (silk swatches) are themselves 2-item combines,
for a total of 27 items, not including what it takes to acquire the
viscous mana.  And that's only to get your skill to around 158!

Whenever I feel my wrist start to ache or tighten up, I finish the
stack I'm working on and take a break.  That acrylia armor simply
isn't worth a life-long disability.  :-)
