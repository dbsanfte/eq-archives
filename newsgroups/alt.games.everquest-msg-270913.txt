They did the same thing with a 50 inch Plasma TV I bought WITH CASH and actually tried to make me pay 2500 more for another one after admitting that they sold the one with my name on it... I refused and THEN they refused to return the money.  

Calls to Corp did nothing.  I had to sick a TV reporter on the manager.. still took 14 days for the refund.

Bait and Switch Buy is more like it.. Wouldn't piss on the store if it was on fire.
