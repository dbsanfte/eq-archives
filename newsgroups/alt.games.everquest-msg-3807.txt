Hi, I've put Everquest in the shelf for over 6 months and now I'm getting a
little excited about starting it all over again.  But I have no idea what
server I want to be on.  I still have some friends on the old server but I'm
not sure if its good start a newbie character on an older server (I play on
Tribunal).  I'm afraid that it would be difficult to find lower level
characters to team up to hunt with.  So what does everybody else think?  I'm
thinking about playing on the roleplaying servers.  If they still exist, can
anybody please tell me their names?

Thanks
Dave
