There you're carrying it to an extreme. He didn't say "perfect", he
said "alright". Nobody has said the system was perfect. There has yet
to come a game that has any of its systems perfect.

Anyway, point being that nobody here accepts my "observations" such as
the one you made without any sources and data cited to back them up,
why should I accept yours?

I do hate to break it to you, but, much like in real life, the only
way to get reasonably better at a trade is to actually do it once the
basics have been learned. You want to get better at sewing? Then sit
your ass down in front of a sewing machine and sew.
