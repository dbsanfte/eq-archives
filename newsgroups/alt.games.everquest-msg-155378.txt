Group or not, depends on the zone for me.  If you are in a zone where trains
can from, going solo there is not a good idea.  You may be able to control
the mobs, but not all the player in the zone has mobs under control.  Train
will run you over.

I group to lvl faster, and solo to get my skills up.  If you group a lot
your skills begin to lag so badly that at higher lvl you become dependent on
group to survive.  I have been soloing a lot lately to keep most mob
fighting skills toped off.  For Pally at mid 20s that means 1H slash, 2H
slash, 1H blunt, 2H blunt, Archery, Offence, Defense, Bash, Dodge, Parry,
Double Attack!  It takes forever to have all those skills up!  In fact I
need to kill myself many times so that I stay in lvl while my skill can
catch up.

Twinked PC lvl faster too.  But when you get to higher lvl, mobs become
stronger and twink effect diminishes.  At that point you don�t have the
skill to fight it!

I also solo to �farm� green mobs with PP.  I see lots of farmers out there.
When you are at low lvl PP is hard to come by.  So when one get to higher
lvl greed takes over, and one try to acquire more money.  ........That
reminds me I g2g Mammoth farming.  Cya ;)
