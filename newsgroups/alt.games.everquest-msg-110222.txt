A 2 second delay would be a pretty extreme example. A 5-7
second delay is more common.

The answer is the first, not the second. Basically, each
Cleric in the rotation makes a key that starts healing and
tells the next Cleric in line to count to X and then start
their heal. When you see your name, you count out the time
and then press your "heal button."

Shorter delays obviously mean more healing power, but a
faster mana burn rate (thus requiring more Clerics for
prolonged fights). A delay is selected based on the expected
damage output of the mob (slowability, etc.).
