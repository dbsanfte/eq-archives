First if they are inviting you at 24 they are a more fun/grouping guild (and
this is what you want at this level). They usually have no time commitments
and just use it as a chance to get to know people and group with them.
One thing I would do before joining is look at the members and their
levels.If they are of a like level then give it a shot get to know more
people and hopefully find groups that work well together and learn to work
together.

As to why they want a newbie, why not? They can teach you things and you can
help them out and maybe even come up with a new perspective on something.
Heck they may just like you :)

No matter what people say, people join guild all the time and out grow them,
it happens.If you wait to join a guild until you find the perfect one, you
will never join one. Every guild has its share of dumbasses.

Later if/when you make the 60's you may consider a raiding guild, here you
would be making a time commitment, so ensure you understand what they
expect.
