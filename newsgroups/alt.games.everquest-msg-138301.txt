Hi all,
While wandering (oops crawling I should say) through the Bazaar today I
decided to do some selling due to some pickups from a Venril Sathir kill.
I duly typed /bazaar to give me the trade lists so I could check prices and
BLAM back to my desktop I went (happened four times in a row).  No changes
to my system at all in the past month or so.  Game has been working fine up
to then.  EQ works fine outside Bazaar logged on to travel the zones .. no
problems.
Is anyone else having this problem and do they have a solution?
regards
@ndrew
