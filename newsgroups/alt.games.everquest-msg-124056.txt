i had  a generic sound card that popped a lot on eq so i bought a new
phillips magnavox harmonic edge sound card and with that one it seemed to
always skip, got a sound blaster and i constantly heard loud footsteps even
when i wasnt walking and no onw was around, then i bought a new comp with a
build in yamaha sound card and the sound finally works.  its weird playing
eq with the sound on.  btw i had a p3 550, and the sound first messed up
when i installed xp, and i now have a p4 1700 and the sound is good even
with xp
