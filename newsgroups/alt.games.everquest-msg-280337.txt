At work I use an open source (free) utility called Synergy
(http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/) to control two PCs with one keyboard
and mouse. You set it up so you can move the mouse pointer back and
forth between two screens and whichever screen the mouse pointer is in
is the screen to which the keyboard input goes.

This doesn't solve your problem Rumbledor but I thought I'd mention it
as the discussion is on 2-boxing. I have not yet tried it at home with
EQ so it might not work but it certainly works very well on my machines
here at work.
