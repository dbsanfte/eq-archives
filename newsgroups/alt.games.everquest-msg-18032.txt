This should be in an FAQ, and probably is somewhere.
The recycle time on the Divine Aura line is about 15 mins.
This is to stop you being totaly invunerable.
You have to wait for 15 mins after meming the spell before you can cast
it.
This is so that you can't cast, sit, forget, mem, cast.

It is very confusing, but if you wait long enough the spell will become
available.


HTH,
