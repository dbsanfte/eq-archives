Greetings to a fellow Druzzil-Ro resident )
The rings you reference are of a kind that are player-made. Specifically, by
a person who has worked quite a bit on their Jewelcraft skill. Since all
magic jewelry requires the use of enchanted bars of precious metals, you
will find that MOST high-ability jewelers are enchanters, since they are the
only ones able to cast the "enchant [metals]" line of spells.  Some others
who are working on tradeskill-related quests may be Masters (skill over 100)
or GrandMasters (skill over 200) and they will have the skill to make some
useful items, but still will need the services of an Enchanter to make the
enchanted bars of metal for them.
That being said, anyone who is advertising for the 6/65 rings will have the
skill needed to make the lower-end types (4/45, 5/55).  My suggestion to you
is to purchase the 6/65 when you can ( I bought mine at 800pp many months
back), and avoid the lower ones. A dropped alternative is the Jagged Band
(AC 5, +STR ??) that is found in the lower parts of Unrest. Last time I saw
one for auction in the auction channel the seller was asking 50pp.
