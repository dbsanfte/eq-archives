similar problem, different zone.

the instanced zone in CoD (i think, still get all my EQ/EQ2 zones mixed up 
sometimes) for the "forgotten potion - into the hive" quest doesnt seem to 
be working.  ive zoned in twice but was unable to defeat the mobs.  leveled 
up a bit and went back, and now the door doesnt even highlight on mouseover.

i submitted all this in detail, and wonderful customer service tells me to 
right click on the door and check something,  even after i told them i cant 
interact with the door.

so looks like i'll be deleting the quest and starting over again.
