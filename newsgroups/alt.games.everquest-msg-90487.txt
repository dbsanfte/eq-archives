In the video options within EQ, turn the "screen same size" or "screen same
resolution" or however it's worded off then on again, or vice-versa
depending on how it's already set.  That should take care of it.  I used to
have to do this everytime I logged on, now strangely I only get the mouse
cursor at character selection screen then it disappears as I enter the game.

Good luck,
Sean...
