Vah Shir are KoS in Cabilis but being agnostic they should be able to gain faction very easy. Grobb and Cabilis are the only places
that anyone has found the blast of frost spells. I have Iksar friends so getting the spells was not a problem for me. Cabilis is the
only place I know where all the spells can be gotten that easy. The poison spells in the ogre/troll area is in innothule swamp.
I have been informed that the missing spells in Shar Vahl for the beastlords are supposed to be quested but as of right now the
quests are either broken or undiscovered.
