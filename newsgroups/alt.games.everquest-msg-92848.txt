Hey all,

Thanks for the help earlier. I bought Luclin and 256Mb more RAM. But turns
out my weinie little Voodoo3 3000 card just ain't going to cut it. So I am
going to buy a new card tomorrow. Now my question is which one. I am looking
at a couple and hopfully someone will be able to help me out.

First off I found a place that is selling the GEFORCE 2 MX400 64MB for $90.
I also seen the GEFORCE3 Titanium 200 for $204. I checked the stats on the
two and I do realize that the GF3 is better in a few ways. But I wonder if
it's worth the money to go for the 3 ... or will the 2 handle my needs. Pre
Luclin I was running no problem at all with my rinky dink 8MB card. Please
keep in mind these are Canadian prices.

Anyone have any insight on this? I really don't want to spend more money if
it's not totally necessary.

Thanks all!
