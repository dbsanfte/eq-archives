A few reasons:

1) Now it *matters*. In Kunark the one group content was doable by one 
group whether they had VP gear or not. Ditto Velious. Ditto Luclin. Sure 
the raiders had it a bit easier, but groups weren't holding out for raid 
eqipped tanks to roll around sebilis, velks, ssra... etc.

2) For the last few expansions the raiders and 1-groups have been 're-
united' in a number of zones. Back with endgame Luclin, through PoP and 
God the two groups have been kept pretty separate. Many primarily 1 
groupers haven't been more than a single zone into GoD, and are only 
just now hitting elementals etc in PoP. It might have cropped up 2 years 
ago except that we weren't playing 'together'. Raiders were all deep in 
the blocked zones.

Starting with OoW, and now DoN many high end zones are 'immediatly' 
accessible to everyone who buys them... so for the first time since 
Luclin players with endgame raid equipment are literally rubbing elbows 
with people in bazaar gear.

Nope. More regularly available during peak time (or the fortune to be in 
a guild that raids within their schedule). That's the -only- thing many 
raiders inherently have over a significant number of 1-groupers. 

There are a lot of part-time / incompetent one groupers. But there's no 
shortage of competent 1-groupers who put in enough time yet do not raid.

So your your saying you put up with monotony too? I can accept that. You 
get much better gear out of it though. I still see a problem.

Time put in != reward

So its merely a happy coincidence that the way you find most enjoyable 
also happens to be the most 'numerically' rewarding? Lucky you.

Indeed if the same gear dropped from raiding as grouping what would you 
care? You just asserted you're directing your effort in the way you find 
most enjoyable... you can continue to do so, and you'll still get 
rewarded for it. So what do you care if people who don't find your way 
of playing enjoyable (or who can' play like that) are equally rewarded 
and having as much fun?

Or is being elitist part of the "fun"? ;)
