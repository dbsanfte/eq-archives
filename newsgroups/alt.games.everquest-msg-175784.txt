Our war isn't against Iraq or North Korea at this time, it is really against
the false government we choose to live under bearing the name of the United
States when the United States ceased to exist about a month ago. Like I
showed you earlier, the Federal government no longer has any legal
authority, of course you can't get a fair trial anymore so it's likely a
moot point anyway.

All I can suggest is that whatever individual states there are that don't
want to live under this regime should band together, create a new Federal
government based exactly on the old one without the terrorist act, take over
the states that oppose by force, then take over the world again with
England, France, Mexico, Canada, Israel and Australia

Lets say Washington leaves the Union creates a new federal capitol in
Washington and then forcibly takes over California just by driving a single
tank into the state capital. If you did that then the rest of country would
probably follow suit. It really would just take one well calculated and
planned act of military defiance, preferably with no casualities to break
people of the deception they are under. It may take more but there must be
some a rogue general out there somewhere in command of a militia or army of
some kind and I'm certain it must be in Washington.
