Hi all,
    First off, I'm not that new to eq, I first played in '99/00 and returned
in 2003.  But for the life of me, I can't figure out macros.  For instance,
I want to eat whatever is located in slot 2 when ever I hit the left mouse
button.  Is there a way to do this?  Have I overlooked something?  Any help
would be appreciated.

Second, what is up with the Hill Giants in WC.  One of these conned dark
blue to me (a 34 cleric) so I figured, np.  Well, after nukin' him several
times with Wrath, I had to root and sit to med back up.  At this point he
was at 51% and I was at 69%.  Are these just waaay underconned or am I just
waaaay too ambitious?
