As a Cleric, I get to have that same feeling whenever I have spare mana.  I
routinely sit around the passage to Rivervale and buff people coming out.
If I see a newbie fighting a fire beetle and having a tough time, I'll toss
a few buffs on 'em, and heal 'em up for good measure.  Drive-by buffing like
that is one of the biggest joys of the Cleric I've enjoyed so far.
