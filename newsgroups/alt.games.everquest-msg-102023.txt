    Yeah. I was a guide recruit for a while before I realized I just didn't
have the time for it. Sometimes, a petition would pop up and everyone would
immediately try and grab it then curse, in a joking way of course, at the
guide who did get it. :) Other times it seemed like no matter how fast we
worked, the petitions coming in were faster than we could get them done.
There were even times when I wasn't on duty and would check on the guide
website the amount of petitions in the queue and see something like 20 or so
and no guide or gm on duty. Since I was an aprentice, I couldn't log in
unless a full guide was on so there's nothing I could do.
    Also, it does list an account ID number but does an automatic /who all
ID# whenever you pull up the petition. So, you get a list of any character
on their account even though the petition is in another character's name. I
guess it saves time and maybe hasn't been in for very long. I enjoyed being
a guide for the short time I was one. Some people were never happy with
anything you did, but others were extremely polite and made it enjoyable. I
guess that's like any job dealing with customers though.
