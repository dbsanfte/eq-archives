Lots of good discussion on this topic.  Suffice it to say I agree
with most of the other posters: it'd be a terribly lame thing for
Verant to do.

This idea leads me to another interesing idea: what about giving
characters the abilitity to change classes?

I love the FV server so much that I put up with the one character
rule.  I played a wizard to 24, then deleted him; I played a mage
to level 30, then deleted him; now I'm playing a druid (level 15
right now).

I'm wondering what it would have been like to have my original
level 24 wizard switch classes.  Switching from wizard to mage
would have been pretty natural (no race change necessary, no
stats change necessary; in fact, for the most part, no equipment
changes necessary either -- with a few exceptions).

It'd sure have saved me a LOT of boring "lets go through all the
low levels again" time.

I'm not sure how switching from my 30 mage to a druid would have
worked, though.  First, it involved a race change, from high elf
to wood elf.  Second, it involved stat changes; that is, I put
most of my bonus points into wisdom instead of intelligence.

And, needless to say, lots of equipment changes.

So I'm not sure ALL class changes (especially those that require
race changes) are feasible.  But some seem natural, and I think
it might make a cool addition to EQ.  Perhaps you'd need to
discourage rampant class changes by imposing some kind of penalty.
For example, perhaps you'd need to lose 1/3 of your levels, or
something like that.

Or perhaps have class (and even race?) changes involve some kind
of quests...

Just thought I'd mention it and see what people think.
