That sort of thing would've been great at the game's inception.
I have to wonder whether it would interest very many players at
this point in the game's life tho (if I had to guess I'd say
that less than 1% would be using these zones "as intended"
within a month or so of release).  The overwhelming majority of
players seem to care little about anything save level advancement
until they get to the high 40s (or even high 50s).  This is
certainly true of the overwhelming majority of players with whom
I've had conversations that were more-or-less on this topic. They
generally can't understand how my "main" could be "only" L54 after
well over three years playing the game.  I wish I could think of
ideas for "special" content that was geared specificly toward the
non-uber, with mobs and quests that were interesting for groups
and small "raids", designed to prevent soloing (let the soloers
twink their alts elsewhere) and somehow kept uninteresting to the
"ubers", with all or nearly all of the loot tagged NODROP.  But
everything I've considered is unworkable one way or another, most
for the same reasons I think your idea wouldn't work in practice,
not necessarily because they're "bad" ideas, but because the EQ
that exists now would prevent them from being successful.
