I wish they had duplicated the method of Anarchy online for giving out
missions. Try that game even if its just to see what I mean, and Im
sure theres even better out there. Perhaps I would still be playing EQ
if LDoN had never happened but the horrid way SoE implemented LDoN
insured I would not. This is an old trait of bad game design, making
what should be easy and player freindly into another aggrivating time
sink. 

Yes you "can" rationalize the current mission system just like you
could believe in the "Lone gunman and magic bullet theory", Santa, or
the easter bunny. All are equally respectable.....
