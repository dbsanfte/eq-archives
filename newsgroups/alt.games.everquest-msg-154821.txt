I dont see how this will change anything, Azalar will still be a human 
druid and Xezor the halfling druid
Unless your saying when the chars are transferred back to Antonius Bayle 
they will have the names Azalarx and Xezorx at which point i can ask 
them to change Xezorx to Azalar and maybe Azalarx to Xezor?
