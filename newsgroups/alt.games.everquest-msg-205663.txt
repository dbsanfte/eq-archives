2 months after release?  Not sure, it's when the Dragoon dirk
started dropping and was a guaranteed drop (they messed up the
loot table, in about 2 weeks it went to 1 in 10)
  
You could go to CB and pick one up for 10pp.  Considering it 
was as good as a Well Balanced Rapier (the best piercer we had 
to compare it to) that was an incredible deal :)

All I know is that 2 druids of my level and I owned the High
Shaman and his captains down in the bottom of Split Paw - got
a RTS and sold it for *25* pp :)
