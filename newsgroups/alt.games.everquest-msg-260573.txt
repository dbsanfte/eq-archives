Guild ran over to Kael this afternoon to take out Vindi.  I ended up 
group leader with my 56 zerker, and was posted over to one side and told 
to take out one of the Temple Guardians who would come with the pull.

Vindi and two TG's came in, I pulled one off with a snare, and went to 
work.  I don't think I ever had aggro on him for more than a few hits, 
mostly he kept ping ponging between an SK and one of my group mates, 
each of whom were sitting on opposite sides of the area we were fighting 
in, and sitting down to draw aggro, while I chased him back and forth.

I hit me Inspired Rage buttton, so every hit landed for a while, works 
on both regular and Frenzy damage; him moving around was annoying 
knowing that if I let him get out of range or "cannot see target" at any 
point I was definately giving up solid hits, not just "well maybe I 
would have missed anyway".  At any rate, I don't think I was close to 
doing the majority of damage on him, casters in the group were landing 
up to 3200 damage nukes right and left, but however it happened he soon 
fell.

Meantime, a 65 SK had the other TG all to himself; he might have had a 
healer (must have?  I dunno, I didn't get hit enough to see how hard one 
would be to off tank), but I came up and engaged with it at about 90%. 
My disc was off by now, but I was on an open back and doing fairly well, 
plus I called in the rest of the group on the target, and soon enough he 
was down too.  Vindi next.

By now the rest of the raid had Vindi's back, with the MT wedged into a 
corner facing out.  There was a lot of ruckus, and a rampage message, 
and someone died.  Beating away on his back, suddenly I was getting hit 
repeatedly... no, just three times, but he'd never even turned around. 
Rampage message up there.  Beating away more, I get slammed around 
again...he's now down to 25%, but I'm at 25% too, I get a heal, I get 
slammed back down to 12%.  Now I slap my reckless disc, which gives me 
12 seconds of automatically riposting every blow... except apparantly 
not rampage hits, I take 3 700 hits and I'm down.

Vindi dies, I get a rez, no biggie.

Loot is his heart, his head, a necro spell, and the Vindi T Shirt, which 
oddly is not Berserk wearable, despite the fact that it fits shaman of 
the same races.  Whats up with that?  I'd even have worn it despite it 
being less AC than my Ornate BP; same HP and +10 attack and higher Str 
bonus.  If I'm MT I wear my fungus patch anyway, if I'm not MT, then it 
seems to me it would help me do damage more than my Ornate one will.

But my raiding mantra;  "I will die, I will not get any loot" holds 
true, I'm gratified to see.

Grage, 56 Berserk, Luclin
