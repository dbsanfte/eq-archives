I concur. Once it pulses once on a target, you have about 15 seconds 
(technically 18, but I'm allowing for the time it will take to refresh the 
mez by restarting the song on the original target) during which the target 
will stay mezzed while you switch to other targets each in turn and repeat.

I always enjoyed CC unless the group was relying on me to contribute DPS at 
the same time. I could do it easily enough, but it became more of a chore 
at that point than I cared for.
