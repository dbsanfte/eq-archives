Not good enough.   If you want to play that way, fine.  I don't.

In a game that takes several hundred hours of playtime to even *get* to your
final class, and several thousand hours to fully explore it, asking a player
to start from the beginning every time they want to take a break and try one
of the other classes is completely unacceptable.

It is for me.   I don't have the time or the inclination to restart every
time.

It's a poor business decision.   That it's costing them sales already.  For
myself, it may not have cost them the original sale, but it will still have an
impact.   The end result is going to be that once I'm tired of playing my
first four characters, I'm most likely going to leave for the next game.  For
Sony this is still a bad thing.   They need to keep players long enough for
them to form long term friendships.  Because that's what keeps people paying
their monthly fees and buying each expansion as it comes out.

Considering that the costs of offering additional character slots on each
account are almost nothing, I can't see what they could possibly think to gain
from this.   Other than perhaps the mistaken belief that a significant number
of people will buy second accounts so they don't have to delete their
characters. I don't know about you, but for me that's even less likely than
deciding to delete my characters, change classes and play again.
