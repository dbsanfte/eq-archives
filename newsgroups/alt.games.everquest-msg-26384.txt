The thread on "skydiving the Hole" got me wondering...

What's the largest sheer drop in all of Norrath?

That is, where can you take a step forward and fall
the longest distance before you hit something?

Note that it doesn't count if you levitate, run off a
mountaintop and over a valley, then drop lev.  You have
to be able to just step off into the abyss.

Hmm, maybe we could also discuss related topics like
deepest ocean trench, longest possible melee corpse
run, etc.  "The Guiness Book of Norrath Records".  :-)
