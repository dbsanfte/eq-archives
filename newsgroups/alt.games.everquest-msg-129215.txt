> How many of those were holding weapons??  950???

950?!  women and children too?  i suppose the many leveled buildings were
housing terrorists too?  oh, let's completely ignore the fact that there
might be innocent people in those buildings... don't try to spit that
bullshit on me or anyone else in this thread.

> There you go.. Justifying terrorism...  So, you shed no tears on 9/11,
> right??

hahahahaha.. trying to throw the "terrorist" label on me?  are you out of
bullshit to throw at me?!
the deaths of countless innocent people CANNOT be justified in any way (for
like the hundredth time).
Quit wasting my time by having me repeat statements I've already made
repeatedly!  check my previous postings!!
have those statements already left your mind?????

Isreal is oppressing the Palestinians with force that the Palestinians do
not, comparably, have!
100 dead is horrible (isreali), but 1000+ and the oppression of many more
(palestinian) is worse!!!!!!!
How am i justifying terrorism?  where the fuck have i said its okay to kill
anyone?!  all i've said is to examine the motives!

start truly analzying situations!!!!!  do the work first, then come back to
debate!! quit wasting my time.
