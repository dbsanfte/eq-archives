/agree David Navarro, the MX card is a rebranded GeForce 2.  Would stick
with Nvidia chipsets if it were me.  If gaming is the sole purpose of the
card and not multimedia (video, photography, etc) the TI-4200 is a rockin
card.  The TI in conjunction with a Soundblaster Audigy (w. IEEE1394) can
give you the multimedia capabilities if you need em as well, just not as hot
as the Radeon 9700.  You gotta love the price of the 4200, nice price, works
great in one of my 3 boxes.
