If you want to make sure there is no risk of KSing, you could cast
Siphon Strength on the orcs.  It will help the people fighting it a
little, and get you the faction.  It's only 5 mana, so even on a very
busy server, you could hit every orc without running low on mana.

Scent of Dusk might be good, too.

Another possibility is to cast a beneficial spell on someone fighting
the orc.  E.g., Dark Empathy on their tank.
