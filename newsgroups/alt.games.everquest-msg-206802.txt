I just started a meathead myself, now at level 27 I was going to go to
Highhold keep but took a little stop in Echo Caverns, wow what a blast this
has been, fighting things called Boglings, there are scouts (blue), boglings
(blue/yel), warriors (red).  I can solo the blue and yellows, the warriors
eat me for lunch solo, but with another partner hacking away the go down
pretty good.

Give it a whirl, there is a little secret passage to EC behind the soul
binder's room in Shadow Haven (assuming you have luclin expanstion).
