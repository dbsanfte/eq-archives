Ok then how? A non-pop player cannot group with the other players.
What Ive seen is one player without pop and almost always gets killed.
Everyone has to change plans to accomadate one guy without pop?  No
they wanna raid then get pop. Raids are not a right btw, a lot of

more. Quit being a burden and get real.
