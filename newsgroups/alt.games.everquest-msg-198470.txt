The first time I passed the PoV/PoS trial, it was all level 60/61. The
makeup was Paladin, Cleric, Shaman, Rogue, Rogue, Wizard. The paladin
was in serious VT gear. I was unguilded and in mostly Skyshrine gear,
wielding my Epic and the Horn of Hsagara. The other four were from a
guild that had topped out in NToV and would break up about two months
later. We did it early enough that we went to PoV together because
there were no pickup groups there.

Since then, I've passed the trial of execution about 30 times and
failed it about 50. I've failed it plenty of times at level 65 with
the optimum group setup and much better gear than I had at 61 (NToV
and higher-end Luclin now.) Other than druid and beastlord, I believe
I've gone through successfully with every class at least once.

There is a strategy for every class to play a pivotal role in the
trials. Some classes do better in tandem. Some classes overlap and
should not be used together.

There is no class that can't be pivotal to the trials. There is no
reason the trials can not be passed by a full group of level 60s. If
you want a four or five person murder squad to run a guild through,
there are specific classes that are more suited to that strategy than
others.

I've failed the trial plenty of times now. Most of the time, it's
because people can't follow directions or don't know their class.
Group composition was a smaller problem than either of these.
