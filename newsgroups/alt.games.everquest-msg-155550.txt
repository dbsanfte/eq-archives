    As much as VI tries to fix places so pets can be used, there's still a
lot of pet-unfriendly places. Especially for raids, which is what these
changes are mostly concerned with. I haven't seen many XP groups surrounded
by piles of mod rods, after all. Taking another recent raid zone, Ssra: pets
aren't used on High Priest, Creator, Cursed. Careful use allowed on Arch
Lich. Always used on Emperor. On the mobs where pets are used, they are NOT
used in clearing to the mobs. If you look at other raid zones, I imagine
you'll see much the same pattern.

    Why they can't land their vanilla fire line nuke, I can't answer - Lucy
shows no reason. But the "Shock of..." line has a knockback associated with
it (so higher resists), and the Bolts are, well, bolts. I assume I don't
need to tell a ranger why bolts might not land that often on a raid. ;-)
