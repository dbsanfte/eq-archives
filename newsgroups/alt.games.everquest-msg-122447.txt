[Top posting corrected]

No, no, no. That's the point. It's NOT in the FAQ. I'm just saying it
should be, because a lot of new players do ask about it here. As I'm
sure others have pointed out by now, other players can't pickpocket you.
Can't happen. They just make hot keys to throw out some text making it
look like they do. Just having a bit of fun at your expense, is all.
Childish and rude, sure, but don't worry. You're not losing any money.
Just laugh at them so they know you weren't taken in.
