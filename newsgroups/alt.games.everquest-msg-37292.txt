The only case I've ever heard of regarding AOL and their volunteers was led
by a seriously messed up bitch.  She was nice enough before the car accident
but ever since she'd been SERIOUSLY whacked out.  Bad meds or not enough of
them.  Her first name was Kelly and her screen name was Belza Brat (though I
called her Bellza Bitch).  I seriously doubt if THAT case went anywhere.

I have a friend whom I THINK is still an AOL guide...I'll try to remember to
ask her about the account thing.
