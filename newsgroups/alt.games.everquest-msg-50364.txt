/book 20 is easier, particularly in hotkeys:

Buffs
/book 3
/say Bergh opens his copy of Buffing for Dummies

Heals
/book 5
/say Bergh opens his copy of Field and Stream Medic

Nukes
/book 7
/say Bergh opens his copy of Artillery and You

PB AOE
/book 60
/say Bergh has never opened this page and never will

Just remember that each book "page" really is two pages
long, so you should have a series of odd numbered pages,
rather than the more logical 1, 2, 3, etc.
