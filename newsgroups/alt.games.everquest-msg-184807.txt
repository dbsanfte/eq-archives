Melee crowding. If the MObs are moving at all and have a small combat
oval, DPS can drop precipitously if people have to climb all over each
other to get a shot in.

This isn't consistently useful, but it's similar to zerg-friendly
fighting. You don't MT all the way through Fear to get to Cazic or all
the way through the Deep to get to THO. It's too slow.

Specific to the THO fight, we find it much more efficient to split up
melee damage between multiple Elder Thought Horrors in the final
clearing, with most of the melees ready to switch focus any time one
gets walled. Besides making the kills noticeably faster, it also means
that repops are more tightly clustered.
