LOL, died to that sucker the other day! Another person was kiting it
around and ran right past me. Nothing happened until the other person
died, then I was summoned, bang, bang, dead...

I have also managed to spawn the Fabled Ancient Cyclops, but called out
for someone to kill it for me given my experience with the Fabled
Terrorantula. The AC version rampages and had a member of the server's
uber guild below 50% before a guildmate of his arrived to assist. They
looted and gated afterwards, so I have no idea what it dropped (.

This also brings up a question. During the 5th anniversary celebrations,
do the regular versions of these spawn or am I wasting my time at the
moment? I have not seen Terrorantula or the Ancient Cyclops since they
started.
