Sadly, kids use more profanity than adults. It gives them a sense of
power and a thrill to say (or this case write) "bad words". There is a
direct link between the use of profanity and a persons level of
maturity (and/or intelligence). "Adults" (those with a higher level of
maturity, not any given age) only use profanity to stress a point.
Using strong language to make a strong point.

I would suggest that you use a "Kill filter" on the people (or
threads) that you find using words that you dislike. That way you can
exercise control over what you see, and you will not be offended. You
can then continue reading the newsgroup. There is no point in
attempting to exercise control over others. The anonymity (sp) of the
Internet brings out the worst in all of us.

>It's just polite.

"Polite" went out of style about 25 years ago. It's "uncool" to
consider how your actions (or words) might offend others.
