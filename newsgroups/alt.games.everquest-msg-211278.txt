Yes, it is an outdoor only AOE (area of effect) lull spell, which works on
mobs up to level 40.

The graphics for it are kinda buggy IMO, it should really have the 'harmony'
effect around each mob that it has affected, but as you have noticed, this
is not always the case.

A good place to see how well harmony can work, is Redwind in permafrost,
harmony him, then pull any of the icy orcs, all should be lulled.  That is
around the area of space it will effect max.

I have never seen harmony (aoe version) resisted, only harmony of nature.  I
do get the message 'your target looks unaffected' when trying to cast on
higher level mobs, but even if I cast it on a lower level mob, and a higher
one was in range, I got no aggro (poacher camp in jagged pine is a good
example of this).

Also remember, that even if lulled, if you pull a mob and it touches another
on its way to you, it will also aggro that mob.

Any time you are unsure of what has actually been affected by your harmony,
re-apply until you think all are lulled, then pull the nearest mob.
