Well, that and, in my case, because it may be a few seconds before I'm 
ready, and we can't predict just how long that will be, because I'm 
waiting for a 12 second refresh button to pop up; depending on the fight 
I'm often chain stunning right up till the mob dies, or if its a runner 
I've probably hit snare to stop it for a few seconds before its death, 
either way, I have to wait out the 12 seconds.

Even without the "stun on break" though, you'll see warriors who want to 
taunt a couple times before break, or perhaps the group wants to make 
sure the mob is slowed before waking it up or... well, point is, if the 
mob is mezzed, you have time to do whatever you like as long as nobody 
wakes it up, pretty much what you said, but I'm just trying to add that 
in addition to optimum positioning there's other things to do, in 
particular figuring out how to keep the mob from eating the mezzer.

I have a... motto is the wrong word. Refrain?  Epigram?  At any rate, 
I've said it a hundred times:

"Verant trains us wrong"

Which tells you how old it is, since SOE's been in charge for a long 
time.  But what I mean by this is, instead of the game gradually 
introducing more complex ideas as we level up, it actually encourages us 
to do things at low levels that aren't just too simple, but plain wrong.

Slow, for example, is nearly worthless at low levels; mobs don't hit 
hard, they don't live long... and the slows that you can cast at those 
levels do very little anyway. Yet at the higher end of the game, slow is 
one of the most powerful tools in the box, or was till SOE started 
messing around with mobs that can't be slowed or that "mitigate" slow 
and so on.  Hundreds of examples like this litter the game.

Yours is another; in your case you're actually saving a little time per 
attack by not having an extra button to press, and nobody is doing 
anything that turns this into a Bad Thing (tm); so you spend 40 levels 
doing it wrong, then when you start getting groups with mezzers and 
facing mobs which, in groups of 5 or 6, can make hamburger out of your 
party, or even single can make mincemeat out of your chanter, and your 
habits are all wrong; you were set up to screw up by the Man!

Sloppy writing on my part, it doesn't actually do that: its

/g my target is -{  %t  }-

And the brackets are only there to help people see the whole name 
without confusion.
