 Any class/race combo that intrigues you will do. You will most likely 
be drawn to anther class later on as you learn more by playing for a bit
anyway, a lot start a new character later on.
 
 So start one that catches your fancy and start in on the learning curve
and don't worry about having to start over. You can have 8 characters
available to play on one server at one time, you won't have to delete 
your first one to try out a different one.
