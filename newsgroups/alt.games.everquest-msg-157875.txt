Well, you're not going to teach me anything about the HISTORY of this group.
If you do a dejanews search under the names "Ingot" and "Gaellic", you will
find me posting WAY back when this group started.  I was HERE during the
time when the Druid became everyone's favorite class to hate.  I chose the
Druid when this game first came out, before anyone knew anything about ANY
of these classes.  (You can tell that by the fact that I chose to be a
Half-Elf, arguably one of the worst races for a Druid).  Still, I had to
grit my teeth while person after person piled on, called us overpowered (it
was NEVER true, we were VERY varied, and we could solo fairly well, but my
Wizard, Necro, Monk and my Warrior BOTH were easier to level up than my
Druid was).  People would see us melee fighting at level 5, and nuking at
level 40, and scream we were both fighters and wizards.  They never
understood that we started nuking when hand to hand fighting became a death
sentence.  We're good at different things at different times, not all things
all the time.

The problem here is that Druids became easy to nerf, the class nobody will
ever defend.  Whenever one of the poor Rangers gets hit with a nerf, the
whole game comes to his defense.  (Not that they don't deserve it!)  DRUIDS
however... Every time we try to argue against anything, every else shouts us
down, screaming that we're over powered (hell, Necro's solo MUCH better than
we do, but nobody seems to have this level of animosity for them!).  We've
become the class that VI can do ANYTHING to, and nobody dares say a thing.
They could remove all our spells completely, and everyone would applaud and
STILL call us overpowered.

And so our history is a long list of nerfs and giveaways, until today there
is almost nothing left to us that we can call our own.

Still, it's not like others haven't been nerfed as well.  In general I've
held on to a wider perspective and only let it get to me on occassion.  I
was suprised when I came back to post here however, and found that those
attitudes were STILL here.  IF Druids were ever overpowered, it stopped
being true YEARS ago, yet we still seem to have everyone on our backs.

Well, I refuse to hold my tongue anymore.  I dont' believe we were EVER
overpowered, but if we were when the game came out, the first six months of
nerfs took care of it.  At THIS point we've been castrated down to LESS than
all the other classes, although we are still pretty varied, and still decent
at different things at different times.

Of course, everyone is going to pile on this message, call me a whiney
overpowered Dr00d, and tell me how wrong I am and why, but I've played most
of the other characters.  I know which ones were easiest.

I'll keep my temper, and I'll make my points logically, but I refuse to let
the tide of misguided fools who like to pick on Druids have free reign.
