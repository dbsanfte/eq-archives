Only thing I can think of would be to have pally almost kill some animal
(green/lt blue) then ranger charm it and then invis and kill it. Of course
this is assuming ranger charm works on animals up to mid 40/low 50s and
pally can take them down with out much problem.  Could also probably fear
kite undead with ranger snare and pally fear.
