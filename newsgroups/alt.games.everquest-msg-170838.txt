Don't remind me, I'd like to think there's hope for my own children.

Ok, how about "if they've any sense at all, they must agree."  ^_^

I disagree.  I think we would be better off scrapping the entire welfare
system and having nothing than to allow this abomination to continue.
Ideally, though, we find something that works... though I doubt it ever will
if the government is involved.

I can find a job today, if I had to.  Whether I could find a job that a
welfare recipient would lower himself to do is an entirely different
question.  Given two months of unemployment, the safety net is adequate if
you're willing to hustle to get a job, and not take it as some sort of
vacation.

Allowing them to remain on the dole indefinately is also a major mistake,
and one we're currently making.

I tend to shy away from the idea of subsidized daycare, but it may be
neccessary to make it work.

That's where vigerous oversight will play a role.  Granted, I doubt it will
do much good, since the union would resist firing case workers found guilty
of corruption.
