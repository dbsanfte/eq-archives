Ack, cleric nerf!

After three years of an entirely useless line, clerics were universally
shocked to see Lull spells working, heck, even working well.  I worked my
butt off to get level 65 and handing in parchments to the enchanter vendor
till I got Pacification, and actually found it fairly useful either as a
puller (hard part is convincing people that cleric is a puller class...
spell just as good as harmony, works indoors and out, twice the HP, better
armor, DA and DB in case of emergencies... are you -sure- you want the
druid to go pull?), to help a puller, or getting past mobs such as the see
invis guards outside Kael Arena.

I didn't notice any extraordinary duration on even this level 65 spell,
and if I had, well hey, why not its a LEVEL SIXTYFIVE spell, it should by
all rights be somewhat on the "uber" side.  (yes I know its a level 62
chanter spell, but still)
