The corpse rot timer part of this is incorrect as of a couple of patches
ago.
I died at lvl 5 in High Hold pass on my way from Qeynos to Misty, and
conning the corpse showed a rot timer of 6 days and change - plenty of time
to do CR.

I generally level all my good aligned characters in misty from 1 to 9 or 10.
After the stuff on the Rivervale side of the wall greens out, go out through
the wall and hang a left, following the wall to the top of a hill a short
distance from the arch. I soloed giant rats, large and giant bats, and the
occasional treesnake there, all of which are non aggro, and non social. Done
a cleric, rogue, and mage there so far. The proximity to the guards is both
a blessing and a curse - they're close enough to run to to avoid death, but
they occasionally chase down a chain of critters that brings them all the
way up to the hill, where they clear everything. You just have to wait for
them to leave and wait on the respawn when that happens.
