   Alot of fun.  Really.  I'm having a blast playing
my human necro.
   You didn't choose you character because of the
stats.  If you had, you would _never_ have chosen
human, ever, for anything besides a monk.  And 
that makes your character special.  Sometimes 
people might ask you why you went with a human.
This can lead to some very easy roleplaying.
Some people might not even grasp at first that
you are a human.  I've been asked, after I call
forth my pet, how I managed to create a HE necro.
For all her career, Teadead is going to be just
a little different that the usual herd.
   Other necros might be more efficient.  But I
can still solo yellow at 19, so I'm not going 
to complain.  Faction is a bit trickier.  Well,
that's what happens when you walk the evil path.
_All_ necros are going to have faction issues.
But you can wander most of Freeport and Neriak,
and between those two, most of your shopping
needs are met, even if you want to do trade 
skills.  If you hunt in Kunark, you'll be based
out of the Overthere Outpost rather than FV.
In Velious you'll have to trade with the gnome
pirates, just like any other necro.  And you'll
learn to use Gather Shadows alot.  
    And you'll have fun.
