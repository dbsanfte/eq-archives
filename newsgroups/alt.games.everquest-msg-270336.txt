I'd forgotten that I did some experiments at one point to test the
claim that FD failure rates varied by zone.  (The theory didn't seem
to hold up, but I didn't try a lot of different places.)  My failure
rate then was 3.88% over about 800 trials.  (If the programmed rate
was 5%, then me having 3.88% or less over 800 trials would be expected
to happen about 10% of the time, I think, so I won't dispute the 5%
figure.)

I went back and tried it again last night.  I feigned 2016 times and
failed 30 of them at the skill cap of 200, so I'm guessing the failure
rate at that skill is supposed to be 1.5% now.  (And I think the jewel
merchants in Cabilis now have a worn spot on their floor. :-)
