With the time it took to get the key and one TPW ( still not sure where 6
adds came from in the middle of a battle ), we only made it to the second
floor.  I doubt we will be going any higher for a while.

That was quite entertaining when I backed onto the Ice while positioning to
Mez.  Jumping and pressing forward got me back on track, though.  We
Levitated the puller and she did much better after that.

There were a few exclamations of "That thing was GREEN?  Damn, it hit hard."
from the tank and rogue.

I had an odd problem with the Skellies.  I couldn't target them to save my
life.  F8 would never pick one up and clicking on its head or anywhere else
had a MUCH higher chance of selecting -anything- but them, including a
corpse that was at my feet.  Very odd.  I was in Troll form most of the
time, but I've never had that problem before while in Troll form or any
other form.

With constant pulling, it took him over 2 hours to spawn, I think it was.
Very disappointing.  We went in with just one key.  Cleric had the key, Wiz
had Evac up, and all of us praying nothing went wrong.

We discussed this and stayed in the alcove because we didn't know how safe
it was back there.  I will recommend going back to the exit tomorrow when we
reconvene.

Since some of us gate / ported out and didn't camp there, we will be
fighting back in, so I'm going to recommend we get 2 more of the first keys.
It may take our whole play-session, but I think it will be worth it.  Then,
we will just level up on the 2nd floor and collect keys as they fall.  I
think 3 of these is a minimum, also.

He's the one that has the "Breast Plate" that our Cleric was interested in -
The Crystalized Shadow Tunic.  I just looked at the item and it isn't
wearable by High Elves!  Looks like our "tower raid" is over ( Cleric is a
HIE =)

Thanks for the input - it's always informative and appreciated.
