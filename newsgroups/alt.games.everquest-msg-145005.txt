Kind of wondering same thing. All such content would be released by
verant itself or be placed on known sites like gamespy or gamespot,
not by some guy working "closely" with verant on planes of power.
What exactly could you "work out" as far as displaying a Q and A with
the game makers if 
you don't have a website? That makes no sense. I bet somewhere in the 
correspondance would be a request for cash.
