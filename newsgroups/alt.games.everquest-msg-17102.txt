No, a big part of it is that the high level characters have thousands upon
thousands of platinum pieces to fling in any direction they want.  It's hard
to compete with them if you're counting silver instead of platinum.  I
remember having to scrimp and save for the first several levels and then
blow it all just to get a respectable sword -- not magical, not high
quality, just standard..
