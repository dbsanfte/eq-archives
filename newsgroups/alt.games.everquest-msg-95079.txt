Hi All,

Ok, Figured out the right side where I can assign things like /pet
attack, etc, and how to move it over the the left where I can use "1,
2, 3" etc. However I made a key for groups with "/assist %t" and each
time the target changes this becomes worthless. In other words if a
player is the puller and leaves and another player pulls I can target
the new puller but when I hit this hot key it does not work. Getting
tired of retyping it in each time the target changes. What am I doing
wrong?

Also how can I reassign CTRL-D so I am not disbanded from groups once
a day. Is this done inside the game itself or is there a file I
modify?

Thanks.
