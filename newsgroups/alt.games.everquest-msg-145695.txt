Youll get a better response in alt.animals.felines (I currently have
13 cats and i would have lost an orphaned kitten without the help of
some people who post there)

That being said.....i can understand that if you are familiar with
people here and have grown accustomed to reading their replies then it
sort of makes sense in a way to ask here....even if it is totally OT
because you know who the bullshitters are and who you can take
seriously.

The guy needs a vet who can handle pets more affectionatly. And its
important that the pet owner take part in whatever practice the vet
performs. You have to get to know how to help hold them and make them
comfortable in a scary situation. That being said.....Lucrezia still
bites the hell out of me and my vet is the only person she respects.
She has been beating me up since she was a kitten.
