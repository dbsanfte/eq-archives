Understanding that soloing is both easy and quick with a much lower
agrivation factor EQ is not the game to go solo only in. Having played
3 strong solo classes (Bard, Druid, and Wiz) as well grouping classes
EQ is boring to solo and a hoot with a good group. So much of the
content is designed around raid and groups and just impossible to solo
(LDoN for example). Try AO or one of the others, much better for the
soloist although even there grouping yeilds higher rewards. That being
said you can solo in AO forever if you wish and not really miss more
than 40% of the content as opossed to EQ where I would put it at at
least 75% post level 50. Good luck
