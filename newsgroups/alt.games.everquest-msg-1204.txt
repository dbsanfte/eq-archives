HI all,

I recently upgraded my computer to a 1.2g Athlon T-bird, 256meg, V5, Sb
live value, and Win ME DX8.

I am experiencing major stuttering in everquest. My old system had a V5
with Win 98SE Dx 7a and never had a problem.  The stuttering is the
worst in the 800x600 screen with the transparent UI.

Are any other V5 win ME dx8 players experiencing the stutter.  Im about
to start doing some troubleshooting, but if this is a problem everyone
is having (although my NG searchs haven't turned it up) I would like
start thinking more about replacing hardware.

Anyone else seeing this.

glenn
