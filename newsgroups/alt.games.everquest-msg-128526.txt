been through this one before, according to the ACCC, bnet *is* part of the
package sold here in Australia, I think Pedro sought out the same for some
European countries.  You seem to be getting hung up on what is "technically"
part of the package - here if it's advertised, it's part of it.  BTW access
to bnet, as such, is provided by your ISP which Blizzard take (or at least
took) great care to point out is your resposibiliy and a cost you need bear.
Now, if you have enquired to the respective agency in the US and they have
said contrary, then that is true for you, but not for me as a consumer.
