I am (was) an @home user.  Got shutdown Friday night.  Received a
nice little recorded phone call that I was getting dropped.  Was assured
I'd be compensated two days for every one I was down.  I was back up
Sunday morning (also accompanied by a nice automated phone call.  Now
instead of @home I'm @attbi.com.  Guess I was one of the lucky 10% that
AT&T was able to move to it's own backbone.

Still miffed, though.  Every two weeks I get together on EQ with some close
friends I left behind in Sacramento when I moved up here.  We used to
roleplay on a regular basis.  Champions, Heroes, StarWars, Paranoia,
Call of Cthulhu, etc, etc.  So EQ a way we can still get in some RP.
Every other Saturday night. Guess what night the outage took place on?

Hope you don't have to wait too long before you get service back.
A dialup must be excruciatingly slow.
