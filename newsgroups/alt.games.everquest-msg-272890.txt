Interesting.  When EQ2 came out, I went for the Station Pass, partly
on the assumption that it would let me try out SWG, and partly because
at that time I couldn't imagine giving up my EQ characters.  However,
EQ2 performed pretty poorly on my computer, so my wife got us WoW.

And here is where I think Sony made a HUGE mistake: I decided that
since we weren't  playing EQ at all, and since the station pass didn't
include EQ2, I'd downgrade my account to just EQ.  Well, it turns out
you CAN'T downgrade: you must cancel your account and, once your
account runs out, subscribe to just EQ2. 

I find that WoW is taking up all of my time, so when my Station Pass
runs out, I'm not going to bother starting up an EQ2 account.  And I
suspect I'm not unique in going the Station Pass route and then
deciding to give up on EQ.  I'm sure that Sony thought that keeping
SWG out of the station pass and not providing a way to downgrade
accounts would make them money, and I'm also sure they miscalculated.
