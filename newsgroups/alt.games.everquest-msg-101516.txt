 Well I've never seen that. I even had him fighting the Warlord guy
outside on the ledge. The most Pendle could kill was two and the second
one was close. I did it about three times so far. And how do you know
how high his MR is? MR doesn't mean anything, levels are more important.
That holds true for PCs anyway but I'm sure it's fairly true for NPCs as
well. No matter how high your resists are, a level 30 is going to have a
hard time resisting spells from a level 65 or whatever Wuoshi is.

 I (unbuffed monk) have tanked Pendle for over a minute. He has a lot of
HP but he doesn't really hit that hard.
