How do,

I'm having problems also.  Creative SoundBlaster Live! 5.1 Platinum --
supposedly a tested/supported card.

The drivers are the latest, but getting a bit ancient now (that'a Creative
for you.)  Everything else up-to-date and the supported versions (incl.
DX8.1).

However, when the spell sounds came back with a recent patch, unfortunately
the sound in general has been playing up a bit for me-


1. Some sounds are intermittant, i.e. not always playing when they should.
   Classic example is walking.  Sometimes the atmospheric sound knocks out
   sound of other things walking around etc, sometimes those creature sounds
   knock out the atmos sound, and so on.

2. Sounds from the same sources now overlap messily

3. For some reason, the "clip plane" of the sound from distant sources has
   been _massively_ reduced.  You don't know there's a HG, undead cyclops,
   etc. until it is right on your back.


It sounds (sic) like they've heavily changed the whole sound system to me? 
I miss the old one, the sound was absolutely perfect (for me at least with
the above, supported, card!)


Veering away from this almost, but not entirely...



In general though; I'm edging on close to giving up with EQ.  Can't make my
mind up.  

I play EQ for a short periods of escape and enjoyment-- half an hour, an
hour, normally not longer.

I knew when I started this that my HLF DRU character was probably going to
be both my first and my last, but was hoping the reason why I would stop
would be more "bored now/too repetative".

However, EQ reminds me why I get a bit fed-up with PC gaming -- patching
and fixing things and dealing with the constant technical problems with new
drivers or new program versions is just NOT fun and eats up way too much
time tediously.

Plus, during periods of heavy patching -- the bulk of it is during what are
my daytime & evening hours as I'm in the UK, so I end up simply not being
able to play, full-stop, during these periods.  If I've got an hour free to
play, then I've got *that* hour free to play, not one obscurely set later on
in the day.

I was thinking that when I got bored of EQ, I'd probably got to DaC (as I'm
a bit of an Arthurian-Legend-o-phile as it is.) However, I see no reason for
that to be/become much different to EQ in the sense of inane patching, and
tweaking away everything that is fun/different to the game (tradeskills in
EQ) to stop the "professional" players getting away with too much, leaving
something that is very bland to serve only as a drug to satisfy addiction &
obsessive compulsiveness.  *:(

I'm a computing & video gaming oldie.  However, EQ was my tester into
massively mutliplayer online gaming.  To be brutally honest, it has been a
bit of a disappointment -- seems to be based totally on the drive behind
dick-sized-wars, to be better than you, higher than you, longer than you,
the most indigo'd Flarl Granfer in the world... 

... with radically little "fun" in getting there, which for me is where the
fun is in the game... the getting there, not the having "completed it" or
"being the highest level".

With the quests & tradeskills, when I started, I was hoping for something
that would be a cross between an RPG & a mud & a home adventure game...

...and that seems to be what EQ is, only what it has become seems to be the
_worst_ of those three genres...

...which is a downright shame, as it _COULD_ have been so much more.


Anyway, I'll shuddup now, as I'm sure similar points will have been made
before, and I'm sure that those of you who are reading this group are here
because you have radically different views towards Everquest than I do
otherwise you wouldn't be here in an obscure netnews group.  (I'm here 'cos
I read masses of netnews anyway, and thought I'd try EQ for a bit to see if
anyone else is having similar patch-hassles to me.)


Byeeee...

Ta-ra,
