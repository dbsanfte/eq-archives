210 is good... and more never hurts, but you're reaching a 'glass ceiling'

200 Wis is the cap where mana stops becoming level based... above that,
every extra point is worth about 5.5 to 6 extra mana (depending on which
mana calc you use).

Start looking for +mana items (eg: Ulthork Tunic is +3Wis +35 Mana... will
get you a little more mana than Acrylia Studded which is +8Wis)

Look for effects that wil help you save mana (eg Serp Bracer - Extended
Affliction II, less DoT casting needed, tho Reed Belt has the same effect,
is a good mid level Wis item for waist slot, but is fairly rare)

Look at tradeskills (but only if you have LOTS of time and money to burn)
for the Coldain Shawls and Xanthe's/Solstice earrings... you may decide to
skip the shawls and just buy the MQ for the earrings.
