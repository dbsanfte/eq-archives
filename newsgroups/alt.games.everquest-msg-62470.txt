Today, when I logged in, I dowloaded a few files.
Then I pressed "Play online" and I got a message "Patch program updated.
Please restart Everquest.exe"
I double-clicked on my EQ short-cut and then... nothing! I can't run the
everquest.exe file anymore.

I completely re-installed EQ, updated my video card driver, installed
DX8.1... and always the same: when the Everquest.exe file is updated, I
can't launch it. I see the hour glass for less than 1 second and then
nothing.

My configuration:
PIII 450 MHz
ATI Rage Magnum (32 Mo)
256 Mo RAM

Do you have any suggestion? Am I the only one in this situation?
Thanks for your help.

F. PETIT
