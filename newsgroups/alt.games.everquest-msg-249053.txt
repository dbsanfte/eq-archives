I would like to see a small change in this game.

I would like to see hunting as a tradeskill.  Start out buying a point 
or two just like any other skill.  Once you have that, you go out and 
start killing rockhoppers or snakes or whatever is in your newbie area.

At low experience you make a mess of things most of the time.  You ruin 
pelts, you may not get meat or get stuff you can't use.  As you get more 
points you start getting low quality pelts, then medium, high and 
eventually perfect and flawless ones.  Chances of looting meat gets 
higher.

The other small change I'd like to see is getting a fraction of an 
experience point for every attempt.  After all in real life one learns 
from failures, not just from successes.

Over all I think this is a wonderful game.  Work on clipping errors and 
crash bugs first, but I would like to see these two small changes.
