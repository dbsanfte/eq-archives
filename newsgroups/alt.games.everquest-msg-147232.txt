Uhm...it measures exactly the same thing as damage-per-delay.

E.g., it's like fuel efficiency.  We usually talk about that for cars in
miles/gallon.  For some other vehicles, I believe it is customary to talk
about gallons/mile (which, by the way, is a unit of area, so instead of
saying my car uses fuel at a rate of 0.04 gallons/mile, I prefer to say I
use fuel at a rate of 23.25 picoacres).

(BTW, do you know what the most fuel-efficient vehicles ever made were?  The
old sailing ships...Columbus got several thousand miles/galleon).
