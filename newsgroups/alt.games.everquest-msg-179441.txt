Well, I wouldn't go so far as to whine about it, but I found the charm
slot mildly annoying last night.  Summoned arrows still won't feed
from your quiver into your ammo slot, so I have to manually add a new
stack to my ammo slot in the heat of battle.  Couple times last night
I tried to drop them into the goddam charm slot...
