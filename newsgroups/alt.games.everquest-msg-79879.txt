    If you gave a half-strength dragon to a person to control, they'd go
straight for the clerics, kill them in short order while hitting the "breath
weapon" button as fast as it refreshed, then kill the bards, then kill
whatever was left. And camp the corpses, too. The challenge in EQ is that
mobs are so much more powerful than the players that some co-ordination is
required to take them out.

    Might as well give them to players to play in, as very few PCs go to any
of those places (except the zone lines).
