The "absurdly long lasting buffs" were added as a raid consideration.  It
was in response to complaints about the way Clarity 2 was working.   An
enchanter buffing C2 on all 10 raid groups and refreshing it every 28
minutes had little time or mana available for doing anything else.  (1)
Hell, before the "Mod Rod 2 / Boss HP" nerf, single boss mob fights were
lasting for longer than an hour each!... just the part that was fighting the
boss himself.

The same is true for the Focus line of buffs.   For Clerics it was more of
the same reasons, with the additional purpose of reducing the absurdly high
monetary costs of keeping your group or raid buffed.

Although I don't like what buff selling has done to the game (see my other
rants on how KEI whores hurt "honest" enchanters' group chances).   I do
think that the long lasting buffs *are* still necessary for raiding.   And
none of the various plans that have been suggested for limiting the spells,
KEI in particular,  to raiding have been any good at all.   Either they
would have easy and obvious workarounds (Enchanter invites recipient to a 2
person raid rather than just inviting to group) or they would be harsh and
annoying to raid with (buffs drop as soon as you leave a /raid for any
reason.)


(1) I will note for completeness that this wasn't altogether successful,
since they forgot to give enchanters that something useful to do with the
extra time and mana they now had...
