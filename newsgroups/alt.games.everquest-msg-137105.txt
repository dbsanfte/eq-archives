Hogwash. I'm totally familiar with the laws concerning common 
law. I never_once_ responded to any reference you made to the 
above because I thought it was totally irrelevant to the discussion 
at hand.

Quit playing fucking games. Are you now going to say you aren't

and you know it.

You must be about 2 feet tall cause just about everything flies over your 
head. It has absofuckinglutely nothing to do with whether I agree or
disagree with the ruling. If you don't understand the desirability 
of the principle of the supremacy of parliament, I'm done on this topic.

Revisionist drivel. The appointment of judges was never was a 
consideration intended to " balance power ". Judges were appointed 
in order to preserve the integrity of the bench by removing them from
any obligation or perception of an obligation to an electorate, and 
by extension preserve the independence of decisions. Appointed judges
were _never_ intended to balance or over-ride parliament.

The position of power judges find themselves in today, with 
respect to decision making, was an unintended consequence of 
the prick repatriating the constitution. The country operated 
for well over 100 years with parliament supreme and appointed 
judges. All changed with Trudeau. Today a whacko court can
make a constitutional ruling and parliament has no way of changing
it. No change to the constitution can be made without unanimous
consent of the provinces and the federal gov't-- and therein lies the 
problem.

So enjoy the system you think is so great now, because I guarantee 
you one day it will jump up and bite all our bums.
