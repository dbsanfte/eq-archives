I beg your pardon?  You could equivalently have asked yourself why you
made the post that started this thread.  People post here to give or
ask for information, to vent, to engage in conversation, to do many
things.  Amazingly enough that includes expressing opinions.

Our perspectives obviously differ sharply on the "best" response to
encountering the name in question.  I would have smiled to myself,
and perhaps mentioned it to friends and/or guildmates so that they
could share in my amusement.  You, otoh, had a vastly different
reaction.

It's all water under the bridge now.  My off-the-cuff attempts to
argue my position ended up going in circles, so if you don't mind
I'm going to cede the field this day.  Someday though, when you
least expect it, the faithful will once more march forth to do
battle beneath the banner of the Golden Spud!  And we shall
vanquish all who dare to stand against us!
