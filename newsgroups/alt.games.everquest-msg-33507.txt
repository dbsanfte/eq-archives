Are you sure about Thurgadin?  I saw a KoS-to-Coldain level 60
Warrior trying to attack several NPCs in Thurgadin the other
day, and often failing.  One of his friends dragged his corpse
out from under the noses of several high-level NPCs, and they
never aggroed.

I believe the friend was a Rogue doing sneak/hide, does that
avoid the "drag-a-corpse-and-die" aggro, or is there no
drag-aggro in Thurgadin?
