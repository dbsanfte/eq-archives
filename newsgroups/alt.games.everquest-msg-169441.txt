There are no limits to AA accrual on a per level basis.

You put as much exp as you like into AA, up to and inclucing 100%.  When
your AA exp bar fills up, you get one point of AA.  You can spend those
points, or not.  If you don't, they accumulate.  I believe the max number of
stored AA points is 60.

Until you hit level 51 you cannot put any exp into AA, and of course cannot
spend AA on anything.

Until you hit level 56, you can only spend points on general AA.  There are
at least 12 of these and you can spend 3 or more points in each, so thats at
least 36 AA plus the 60 or so you can save, say 96 AA max pre 56, were
anyone insane enough to do this (this would be enough exp to level from 51
to 52 96 times)

Once you hit 56 and have at least 6 points in general AA, you open up
another 12 or more archetype AA (different table depending on whether you
are a melee, priest, or caster, something like that) and each of those costs
something like 2 points for the first level, 4 more for the second, 6 more
for the third level.  Thats another 144 points worth of potential
expenditure, plus the 36 from general plus 60 stored would be 240 max AA.

Then at 59 you get access to another dozen or so with similar AA point cost
setup seperate list for each class.  Say thats another 144 points maxed out
(its more) then you could have 384 points between spent and stored.

Then at level 61 you get access to two different lists, each at least as big
as the level 56 and 59 ones, so say 288 more points worth, 672 total max
points... although actually some of those are not spendable till you reach
63 or 65, others not till you hit 62, 64... but anyway, by level 65 you
could spend another 612(more or less) level 51s, in theory, plus bank yet
another 60, if you were so inclined.
