Plat dupe bug, people duping plat buying up high level items and selling
plat online for very very cheap. People who buy duped plat cheap ($9 for
10k, used to be $30-40 per 10k at highest) also buying stuff up. People seem
to disagree if theres a dupe bug or not but there is a guy who leads a huge
EQ plat/item/account site who sells billions and billions of plat over every
server. Also there is another guy who is selling millions of plat on PA who
before a few months ago was not selling plat at all, or hardly even a
percentage as much. Several other people as well. It makes a lot of sense to
me. I go into bazaar every day and check the bazaar chat and people are
/auctioning buying dozens of items worth 100k++ which are *in no way
related*. I mean if a warrior is buying stuff for himself hes buying warrior
things. If hes buying stuff for a monk hes buying monk things. These guys
are buying stuff for casters/tanks/priests/monks and buying multiple weapons
for different classes. If someone wants a weapon they dont /auction buying 3
primarys and 2 secondarys two of which are WAR only and one is BST/MNK
only... Why they do it is because the plat is duped so it will probably be
recalled, but the items will always keep thier value. In any case thats my
two cents on the subject.
