Velious has a transparent inventory in full screen mode you can see by
typing "i" for inventory (so you don't switch res to the inventory
screen) It also has transparent moveable windows. I really don't know
how much of that you see in Kunark.

Try going to display and put "Screensame size resolution ON"
That makes it so when you switch the screen mode you are STILL in 800
x 600 or whatever, it switches much faster and you have a black border
around the smaller 640 x 480 area.

Yes, they said that with Luclin they are finally doing away with the
old 640 x 480 change view residue altogether so everything should be
at the same default res you play in. I don't know if you still get
that without luclin installed.
