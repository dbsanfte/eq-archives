Well, if you're just using Bellow, you won't be able to kite very
quickly, but it is almost never resisted, so you could reasonable kite
things several levels above you if you want to spend the time.  As you
move up in levels you will get your chants, which do some serious
damage with the right drums.  I've sucessfully kited up through 55,
and can take down almost any non-caster I can find in an outdoor zone.
