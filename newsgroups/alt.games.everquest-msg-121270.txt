Because they cant keep up with dammage is why noone wants them in a group,
they slow the party down, take an equal share of the exp and can't hold there
own.

I see nothing wrong with in an avarage 6 person greoup the wizard being able
to do 40-50% of the total dammage.  Its the warriors job to take dammage, why
whould they outdammage someone who cant take dammage at all?

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and
others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on
the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
