Where did you hear/read they were banning people for using EQW? I'm curious
because I have used it and asked a friend of mine who is a guide about it a week
or so ago and he said it was not bannable (although he also said he wouldn't
advertise that I used it and muttered something about trojans, viruses, etc.)
I'd like to know for sure because I'd hate to lose my account over something
like that. . .
