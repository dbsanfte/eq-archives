Not really enough to matter. Are your melees having a substantial amount of
difficulty hitting the mob (assuming blues/whites)? Would be unsual if this
were true. Cause you can toss cripple (which for enchanters is like level
53 or so) on a level 10 mob and the people fighting it won't notice the
difference at all. About the only time it really helps is on mobs that
frequently flurry...the -dex cuts down on their flurry rate a bit.

<advice request snipped>

Unfortunately, I've never played an enchanter, so the spell specifics are a
bit lost on me...best advice would be to find the enchanter board (there
must be one somewhere), or find a bored high level Enc on your server and
get some tips from him.
