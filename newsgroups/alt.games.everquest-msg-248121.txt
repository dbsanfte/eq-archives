Yep, that can happen. What I suggest is that you keep your pet close
when moving over complex landscapes like the chutes-n-ladders in CC or
other places like that. Old world zones especially tend to have some
very weird pathing.

Don't even summon your pet until you're in a stable camp if you can
avoid it.
