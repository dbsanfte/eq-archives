I was looking over the new AA's last night, and I'd sort of decided that 
the first ones I would get would be the two new run speeds, since Run 3 
was so clearly the most useful general skill we got originally. I solo 
or duo a fair bit with no Sow'er in the group, I have to usually pay for 
a sow before I go soloing, and it's a PITA if not lethal to have it run 
out on some kites. Thinking if Run 5 is anywhere near a high level Sow 
it would eliminate the problem permanently.

However, the AA description in game described it as "slightly increases 
your speed" or something like that. If it's not even a measurable 
increase, I'm not wasting all those AA points on it.

So... anyone get it and measure it yet?
