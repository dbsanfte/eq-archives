At level 8, berserkers get Leg Strike, which snares the target, at level 
8 for 48%, going up to 55% by level 15.  Duration is one minute

At level 32 I can look forward to getting Leg Cut, which snares the 
target 55%, duration one minute.

At level 54, there's Leg Slice, which snares the target 55%, duration 
one minute.
===================================================================
At level 16 I got Head Strike, which stuns the target for 4 seconds and 
works on NPCs up to level 55

At level 40 there's Head Pummel, which stuns the target for 4 seconds 
and works on NPCs up to level 55

At level 60 there's Head Crush, which stuns the target for 4 seconds and 
works on NPCs up to level 55
===================================================================
Diversive Strike, Distracting Strike, and Confusing Strike, levels 24, 
48, 65, all have the same text, saying they reduce hate and hate generation.

The only ability which actually seems to get any better is the War Cry 
series, which has a higher and higher attack boost with the higher level 
entries in the series.  Of course I've heard that the ability is 
universally despised, as it takes a buff slot and prevents much more 
useful buffs from working, or is prevented by them.  With a duration of 
one minute usable only every 30 minutes, its pretty clear its for taking 
down a tough raid target, and in a raid its very unlikely you'd not have 
whatever it is in conflict with (and that you want to spare a buff slot 
for this ability)
