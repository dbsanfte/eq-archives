I'm a tinker.

The rarity of the dropped components is what drives the prices up on
these.  I tried making them to sell for $$$, but it just wasn't worth
the time invested.  Even the trip to Katta, a city I don't visit
often, is kind of a pain. 

If I was farming the components, I would want 2k for the tailoring and
jewelcraft one, and 1k for the rest.  Don't think they're worth that
much to the tradeskiller who will use them, but that's a fair price
for the time and effort, not to mention the $$$ I put into getting
tinkering high enough to make 'em.

Though I'd probably do the combines for free if someone gathered ALL
the components for me.
