 Don't know if anyone else has had this problem but after going to test
server and repatching back the bats and rats in game have new graphics.
There are pretty awsome looking but the bats are almost impossible to target
and the rats are huge and both puts off so much lag I can't move while
fighting them. I've looked but can't see anyway to delete the new graphics
and let eq rebuild old ones. Anyone else having this problem and if so how
do you get the old graphics back?

 Thank you ahead of time for any help.
