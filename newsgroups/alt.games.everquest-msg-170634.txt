Well, you don't know the numbers as posted above, those were merely examples.

But you can certainly find out a mobs' aggro range via experience.  Find a mob
standing there in sight.  Approach slowly, watching the mob.  When the mob turns
your direction, note your position.  Thats roughly how far away from him you can
get before he aggros.  I say slowly, and roughly, because mobs don't pay
attention all the time, they look around periodically.  If you move in on them
fast, you can get well within their aggro range before they notice... in fact at
bard speeds, sometimes its possible to move right past a mob that would aggro on
anyone slower, because you got lucky and were in and back out of range before
they checked again.

Another plan is to move towards the mob, then sit.  Stand up, move closer, sit
again.  Sitting makes you a more interesting target, often mobs will attack you
from further away if they see you sitting down.

If you really wanted a number, you could note your loc when the mob aggros, then
FD or blind/atone or something to get him to go home, invis up, and go find the
loc where he stands.  A little math and you'd have the exact distance of his
aggro range.  That would apply, however, only to your level and possibly even
only to your faction (I think it takes longer for mobs to attack if glaring than
if scowling... but I'm no expert on this)

Given these problems, I doubt there's a database out there with aggro ranges for
all mobs, but its possible there is one for some... or its possible someone has
hacked the SOE database and has printed out all this information and posted it
on the web somewhere.
