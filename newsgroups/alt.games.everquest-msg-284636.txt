I didn't want to use KOS mobs because I figured, as I ran back toward
them from my bind spot, they'd spot me before I reached them and would
run to meet me, thus gradually getting closer to my bind spot.  Too
much risk of a death loop.

I didn't try Freeport, but since I wasn't allowed to attack the guild
masters or guards or discord priest in Kelethin, I figured all the
starting cities were similarly nerfed.

A Nexus scion would probably have worked, assuming they can still be
attacked.  (When DID the newbie city guards become unattackable?  Was
it the same time everyone got infinite Safe Fall in PoK?)

I ended up using the three Shadow Haven guards at the Bazaar zone line.
Once I was unbuffed and nekkid, they could take me out in under five
seconds.  And when I dropped each level, I could just zone into the
Bazaar, get a fresh SOW (actually used Spirit of Scale, it's faster as
long as I wasn't casting any spells), and zip around checking /cons.
There were a few times when /w all <level> showed nobody of the needed
level anywhere on the server, but I got most of the numbers I needed
for levels 53-63.  Now to find time to ponder them.

I also have a picture of all 124 corpses. :-)  And when I did the
Expedient Recovery, I did it in PoK so I could leave the nice ring
of bodies outside the bank.  (The corpses apparently get summoned
into a fixed number of positions around you, so each body is actually
about 8 corpses on top of each other.  I forgot to loot the first one
before doing the Exp Rec, so it took me a while to find my stuff!)
