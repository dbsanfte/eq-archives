I haven't seen that, but this is beta and players, if they're like me, 
are trying everything they can given these are throw away chars. How 
it will work when EQ2 goes live is anybody's guess, but I can't see it 
being any different. There will always be people you wouldn't want to 
group with, and from my experience in EQLive, they are a big minority. 
I've made the decision not to purchase the game, so tonight is my last 
night playing. I'm off on my 27 cities in 21 day European tour 
tomorrow evening. A Rock Star's itinerary minus the perks, bonuses and 
salary ) Before I leave however, I'd like to wish everyone who will be 
continuing on when it goes live, much fun and enjoyment. May our paths 
cross once again in a future game!

I haven't found debt of much worry so far as long as you recover your 
shard. Working it off takes almost no time at all. I might have a 
different view had I been the gentleman who died many times on beta1 
this morning from various griffon misadventures.
