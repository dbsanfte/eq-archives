Alex I am guessing this was your first visit to SA.  You might either be
further upset or amused, not for me to decide which, to find out that it
is a satire site, not a gaming news site.  The reviews of the games that
he does whether in beta or retail are not meant as serious reviews of
the games, but as entertainment.  If you've never read his review
written during the AC beta you missed some silliness on a grand scale. 
The other sections of the site are amusing as well, especially any of
the JeffK 31337 4@x0r!!!!1! stuff.  If this sort of humor isn't your cup
of tea of course you will not be amused, but I'm pretty certain they
won't mind, they just aren't really trying to impress you with their
accurate and fair review is my point.
