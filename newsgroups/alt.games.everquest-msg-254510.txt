yeah, the only problem is that I'm on the 30-day trial and I don't get 
access to the bazaar. I plan on getting the platinum edition when it 
comes out at the end of this month.

yeah, no gear envy here :) I just want to know what my next goal should be.

heh, yeah. Most of what I read all assumes you're leavel 65+, which I'm 
sure I'll never be. It is difficult to find good low-level stuff geared 
for the true newb to EQ. I guess after 5 years they pretty much assume 
they've gotten all the new players they're going to get. Although, the 
new free trial probably changed that.
