While I hate to let the secret out (ok, it's not *that* much of a
secret) go to the gnoll caves in Jaggedpines. Not at the entry, down at
the dropoff or over in the big room near where the boss mob spawns. One
of our mages solo's there exclusively (or did until he dinged 58 there
anyway.) The mobs have an aggro range of about three feet, and the hit
points of a housecat. What's best is they are dark blue till 57 or 58.

Mage/necro/shammy solo paradise. Very low MR also.
