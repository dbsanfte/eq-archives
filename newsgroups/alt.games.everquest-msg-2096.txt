Not true.  The easy fix to twinking is to put level minimums on all items.
And I do mean all.  If an item is not meant for a particular level range
then tag it.  They are already able to do this with proc's so I'm sure they
can do it with the item itself.  And I'm saying the person shouldn't even be
able to equip it.  Just my 2 copper and I'm sure many people would disagree.
