Garth,

Just have fun... if you die .. don't worry about it.  I have done the quest
twice - first time around the DWGobs in Oasis and Rathe didn't see me ..
second time around they did!

As for the the Hand room ... get an ITU and shout to see if the AM/Lord is
camped .. if so the hand will be camped too.  Shout to see if someone will
guide you to the hand room .. get the rod and gate out :)

Good luck - have fun, I actually started to enjoy dying whilst I was doing
that quest!

Ha!

-BK
