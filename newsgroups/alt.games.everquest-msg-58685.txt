Haven't paid attention to EQ for a while but recently read on another message
board about project m where supposedly on test server a pc can control an npc
and attack other pc's.  Example guy was using was saying he logged into game as
a desert madman in desert of ro and was attacking pc's.  He did say that once
you are dead the npc is gone and you must start over but it sure sounded like a
lot of fun.  Any truth to what I read?  I tend not to believe much of what I
hear on message boards.
