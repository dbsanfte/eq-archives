"Maxium lvl to be assigned a spell has been increased on test from 61 to
255... no real reason to do this other than we may be getting more
lvls....."

uhh, NOT cool! :o(

All that does is allow NPCs to cast as tho they were (upto) level 255.

NPC casters are already smarter... and now we know how PoP is going to make
them even tougher... by allowing them to cast more powerful versions of
existing spells (raising the casting limit means there's now more room to
scale the effects of high level spells past 60... into 'Godly' realms).

Before VI raise PC levels, I'd assume they'd want to add new types of spells
(or else people might just say "Ho hum, more of the same ol' xp grind and
nothing new... let's see what Shadowbane's offering") and I can't see them
experimenting with new spell types while they reckon they're in the middle
of revising the current crop.

... besides... has anyone actually maxxed-out their AAXP yet?
