For 260 pp on E. Marr you _might_ be able to pick up a Slime-Coated
Harpoon.  10/25 +stats, and pretty cheap since Luclin came out.

Serrated Bone Dirk (8/27, procs a DoT/snare) can DEFINATELY be
had for <250 pp.  And they work.  I was dual-weilding SBD's in the
Planes (Fear and Hate were the only two) until a Bone Razor (10/22)
finally dropped...now THAT was uber!

Jagged Chodaki spine (9/22) I've sold on E. Marr for 50 pp before.  They're
cheap as hell because they drop like candy in Chardok and there are
better piercers around.  But for 50 pp if you choose between a Dragoon
Dirk and  JCS, guess which is a better value? ;-)

Sturdy Grimling Mining picks are cheap and not Lore (12/29), BUT they
ARE NOT magical.  That's not a problem on some mobs (actually a majority
in all of EQ), but there does come a problem when you finally do run into
one and you're not ready for it.  29 delay is also sort of slow if you don't
have
some sort of haste item better than a FBSS.  The difference in damage
between my Jagged Ice Shard (12/29) on my alt rogue pre- and post-
getting a Sash of the Dragon Born was pretty noticable, even without
log-parsing.

This is also a good level to be saving your money up for your Burning Rapier
quest.  It does take a while, but it's a lot of fun and gets you "out and
about"
Norrath.  7/20 piercer with some stats and a 37 DD proc isn't bad at level
40, either.

Good luck! Email me your rogue's name and if I catch you on sometime
I might see if one of my other rogues has some stuff to pass along...
;-)
