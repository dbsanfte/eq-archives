    Not on anyone with a real buff up it isn't. And I can't think of a place
where I'd be expected to heal, yet all they need in healing output is what
that helm can provide. Unless I'm PLing, as mentioned above.

    3.12 AC, to be exact. :-)

    Depends where you are and what your AC is like. If you're above or below
the priest class AC "sweet region" for the mobs you're fighting, it'll do
nothing. If most of the damage you are taking is from spells, or AoE
effects, it'll do nothing. Even when you're in the "sweet region", trading 3
or 4 net AC to get 35 HPs is still within the recommended 1:10 swap ratio
warriors follow when swapping AC for HPs.

    Level 56 isn't pathetic, or a lowbie by any standards. :-)

    That seems pretty good. If you have access to full Thurg, I can see why
you'd have that many HPs pre-60. Do you have a Magelo profile?

    I never had Donal's legs, so I don't know how big the jump is without
looking them up. But as someone else has pointed out, it's the biggest jump
of the entire set. I have Thurg quest legs, and don't have the faction to
get Kael or Skyshrine legs (and PoM is just a myth, really). Looking at
every possible cleric leg available on Allakhazam's, with the restriction
that I cannot obtain any of the named quest leggings, I concluded that I'm
wearing my endgame leggings - there's no upgrade to them to be found
anywhere. They're that damn good.
