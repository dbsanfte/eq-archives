Root is one of my virtually permanent fixtures. I used to have a long
duration root memmed most of the time, but had a fast root on the same
page in my spell book incase I should decide I wanted to use it. 
I ended up using ensnaring roots most of the time until 56 anyway,
since I didn't like the mana usage of the higher spells and they
turned into expensive chain cast nukes in situations with mobs
breaking root over and over again when they shouldn't.
Engorging roots > all.
