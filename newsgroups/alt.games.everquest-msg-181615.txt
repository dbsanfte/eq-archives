	Until graphics engines have matured to the point that any given

	and in game navigation systems.

	I'd enjoy navigating by landmarks, but in pretty much every single
	game it's often very difficult simply due to the fact that every
	building, every door, every hall, every tree looks *exactly* like
	nearly every other door/hall/tree/rock in the zone.

	Personally this is why I actually like Neriak (I think I'm the only
	one): Although the zone is a maze, almost none of it looks alike so
	that once you learn it you always know where you are.  In most other
	zones the only "landmarks" are a slightly different curve in an
	identically textured road...  Screw that. :-P
