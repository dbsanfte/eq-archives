You can kill sarnaks, goblins and outlaw Iksars (bandits, marauders,
etc.) till you become dubious to the Trooper guards (who belong to
Legion of Cabilis, the warrior faction); however, you'll still be KOS
to the other set of guards, the Crusader guards (who are Crusaders of
Greenmist, the SK faction).  

To become non-KOS to the Crusader guards, once you're dubious to the
Troopers you need to do the bone chip quest with Trooper Mozo, one of
the guards in Field of Bone near the entrance to Cabilis.  Give him
four bone chips at a time and that will raise your faction with the
Crusaders; I think it takes several thousand bone chips to become
non-KOS to them.

It will also raise your faction with the Swifttails (Monk guild),
Scaled Mystics (Shaman guild), and Cabilis Residents (I think bankers
and some vendors and other various NPCs).

Note:  There is one Crusader, Crusader Quarg, who is on Scaled Mystic
(shaman) faction.

Another note:  The bone chip quest doesn't raise faction with the
Necromancer guild (Brood of Kotiz)--the only way to raise faction with
them I think is by killing outlaw Iksars; however, you can easily
avoid them (there IS one Iksar necro named Grype who hangs out at the
Tink 'n' Babble, near the bank, sometimes, so you might want to avoid
walking by there).

There's a very good thread about raising Iksar faction at:

Hope that helps!
