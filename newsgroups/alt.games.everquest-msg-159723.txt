yes you can invis and give him the carnellians to get the tektite but i
would advise you to have SOW and lev because you will lose invis when you
turn in just like looting so then you run like heck for the zone and its a
merry chase.
then go give the peridot and the tektite to the lord in Sol  temple of ro
for the 3rd scale..the fun part is getting the scales all turned in and it
works smoother with a bit of help from folks that can track...to spawn the
squire you need to hail sir hobble who is usually found out toward the
dogface village just about straight out from the village...when you hail him
have a druid or ranger snare the squire who will spawn in FV and run out to
join sir hobble who is heading to fight with the driders over past the large
iskar statue toward the DL tunnel..the best place to snare and or root the
squire is after he leaves the bridge and before he gets to the statue so you
can run from sir hobble to your compatriot who has the squire snared and
turn in your scales before he starts fighting the driders<who agro on him
and sir hobble like crazy>..then have the snare rooter zone to DL to clear
agro ..it is nice because if several of you have all the scales you can turn
them in one after another before the little guy gets killed or despawns.
