Isn't that illegal in many States? We just got a new 
consumer law here in Ontario, so I'm not sure what would 
happen to subscribers here. Any decent company would and 
should "eat" their mistake. Maybe they have some new albums 
coming out on the music side that they need extra cash to 
use as bribes for airplay )

Glad I canceled when I did! I hate credit card problems and 
I certainly would have refused this.
