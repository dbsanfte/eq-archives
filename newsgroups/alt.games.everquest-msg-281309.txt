Yup, I'm assuming the 'create or not create' check was done at the client
end (ask server if name exists, if it does, tell user you can't create the
character).  Get the client to not do the check, and you can create a
character with the same name, you could NOT log them on if the other person
was on, but once you did log them on ...
