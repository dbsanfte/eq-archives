Since you didn't read what I said in my original post, I'll recopy it to
save the time of arguing with you.

And don't even suggest that I bind myself in the bazaar/nexus/shadowhaven, I
bind myself where it's convenient for me after I die, or somewhere I'm
waiting on a camp so I can gate back after the other person is done.

And as an addendum, porting myself to south ro is close enough for me to guk
to not bother binding at or near guk.
