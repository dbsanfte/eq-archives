I've found this rarely works, sitting seems to be more likely to, for me.

/q drops me out of the game immediately, but keeps my toon there with his LD hat
on for quite some time, and I normally come back, when finally allowed to, dead.

I'm told this is because you remain LD as long as you are on the hate list of
any mob; I don' think thats quite accurate, but it isn't entirely wrong either.

This would mean that quitting before you cast any heals or anything would work
fine, but if you've done anything at all before figuring out that the cause is
lost, you are doomed.

This isn't entirely accurate either, since on occaision I have managed to quit
out after healing... but not often.

If you do want to try quit, DA first should help a bit, or perhaps not.
