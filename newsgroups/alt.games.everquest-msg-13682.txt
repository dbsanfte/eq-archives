im on Thouluxe Paells as well right now all my guild mates around your level
are in LOIO. and the usually stay there untill 26 or so, assuming the dont
need a change of scenery. once you hit 20 the fort holds 4 groups in the
front 2 or 3 inside and 2 out back with allowing constant pulls for
everyone, so its quite easy to find a group, plus theres the Goblin mines
for around your level. and the mill area also.
