My guild is after me to get my epic, although I personally don't think 
its particularly impressive, particularly given the effort most epics 
take to acquire.

I'm not finding much out there in terms of walkthrough for it, just the 
one on Allakhazam; apparantly the principle SK site has been closed for 
a while and nothing has come in to take its place.

So, here's my condensed version, sort of a checklist:

Start:

Talk to Kurron Ni in Overthere outpost
Give him 900pp and Darkforge BP, Greaves, and Helm
Kill him; loot Letter to Duriek.

1000pp to Smaka in Neriak Foreign Quarter for Cough Elixer
Hunt ratman guards in the Hole, loot Dusty Tome of Duriek
Hunt froglok shin lord in UGuk for Ghoulbane, or do quest
Hunt Cazic Thule in Fear for the Soul Leech
Loot Blade of Abrogation off random mobs in Plane of Sky

Teydar in Qeynos Aqeducts will make Decrepit Sheath: quest follows
Drake spine drop from Rharzar in RM
Decrepit Hide off ashenbone drakes in Hate
Enchanted platinum bar
hand to Teydar for Decrepit Sheath

Duriek Bloodpool in Paineel; give him Letter to Duriek, then give him 
Cough Elixer. Then give him Dusty tome.  Next give him ghoulbane, soul 
leech, blade of abrogation, decrepit sheath, recieve Corrupted Ghoulbane

====================================================
Knarthenne Snurl in Toxxulia Forest gives Soulcase
Marl Kastane in Kerra Isle gives Seal of Kastane

Give Seal of Kastane to Gerot Kastane in Paineel, get note to marl
Give note to marl to marl kastane, talk more

Hunt A Chest in the Hole, loot Cell Key
Talk to Caradon in the Hole, give Cell key
Kill Caradon, Kyrenna, loot Blood of Kyrenna and Heart of Kyrenna

Take Blood of Kyrenna to Marl Kastane, get Dark Shoud.
Hand Dark Shroud to Ghost of Glohnor in the Hole
Kill Mummy of Glohnor, loot head of glohnor and wrappings

Give head of glohnor to Gerot Kastane, get Head of the Valiant
Give Wrappings to Marl Kastane, get Will of Inoruuk

Combine Heart of Kyrenna with soulcase, get Heart of the Innocent
================================================================
In COM, give Lhranc Corrupted Ghoulbane, The Heart of the Innocent, the 
Head of the Valiant, and the Will of innoruuk, get Lhranc's coin
Kill Lhranc, spawning Marl Kastane

Give Lhranc's Coin to Marl Kastane, get Innoruuk's curse
