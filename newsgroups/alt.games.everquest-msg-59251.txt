As the others have indicated correctly, dying on the boat happens to
most people early on, and it's a pain. The vast majority of the time,
your corpse rides the boat to the zone line, then falls to the bottom of
the ocean at that point. While there's no guarantee, it seems that the
lion's share of GM's will fetch your body to land for you so you can
recover your stuff if you /petition. If, however, you either don't want
to wait for a GM, or if you get denied a corpse summoning by them, you
can still get it back easily enough. Get out your map of Ocean of Tears
(that's where you died) and look at the course that the Freeport to BB
boat takes through OoT. Find a good landmark to look for towards the end
of it's journey, such as the last islands that it passes. Also see what
the loc of the boat's zone out spot is. Make sure you have a /loc hotkey
in your hotkey bank. Also make sure you have a /corpse hotkey, as you'll
be dragging yours for a while.
  Now, with your map in hand, go ride the boat again. (Try not to get
killed at Sister's Island this time.) Keep on riding until the boat
reaches your landmark, and start hitting your /loc key watching for when
you are getting down to the last thousand yards or so of zone out. Then,
jump off the boat and swim along behind it until you see it freeze up
and zone out. Keep swimming in a straigh line, and soon you'll hit the
zone wall. Then dive down. (You'll be surprised to find that the ocean
isn't that deep, and there's really nothign swimmging around that end of
the zone to be much worried about.) Locate your corpse, hit your /corpse
key every couple seconds, surface, and begin swimming to the nearest
land. Get on the edge of the beach away from any nearby mobs, loot, and
be on your way.
