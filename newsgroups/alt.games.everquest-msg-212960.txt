Well, get ready to pull more of your hair out. I have, in about 120 hours
logged in that bloody zone, seen exactly one essence drop; and it went to
the Enc we had headed up with to get the Essence for. Aside from that, my
luck has been about the same as yours; nada, zippo, zero, zilch. Other Encs
experience the same thing; it seems that Sony, in their eternal wisdom,
decided to nerf the drop rates; whether or not that was intentional remains
to be seen, but it definitely seems to be dropping with even less frequency
than it used to.

I've heard rumours that it drops with greater frequency off the revenants
that serve as placeholders for Coercer T'Val, but again, these are
unsubstantiated rumours and YMMV. I'd say it's worth a shot, though; what's
the worst that can happen?

Also, it drops off both female and male model revenants; it's the armour
drops that are different on the two.
