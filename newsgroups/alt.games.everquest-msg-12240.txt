Weekends are normally none events as far as EQ goes, I rarely hunt, except
for Guild events and mainly just trade and wander a few zones.

Friday;
Nothing to say, to tired when I get back in the evening, sit in bazaar for a
while, contemplate some cobalt Gaunts for 4k, it's nearly 3am tho and I'm
going to bed, the gaunts can wait.

Saturday morning (GMT)
Servers empty (800 from a usual 2500),  Primary is in Antonica, head to EK
to collect some spider silk (Some low level monks in guild can use some
armour) Do I see any Crag spiders? No. If I do spot one on the horizon, it's
on it's back with legs in air by the time I get there. High level monk and
druid are cleaning up the zone of anything with eight legs, oh well.
Head to WK to get some patterns, Kill the Innkeep there so he'll respawn
(off his spot and won't serve anyone) Help take down Swarm Mother.
Leave WK pass thru NK, should be less people on now, maybe EK will have some
spiders. Pass to close to Xannas-whatshisname (he's of his normal spot and
is about the only NPC in the Karanas that doesn't consider me an Ally, in
fact, he hates my guts) Die, in short time.
LOADING PLEASE WAIT...
In Thurgadin, oh dear...no porters or clerics on in guild (only 3 of us in
total)  No one porting from Thurgardin or GD...I log and go out.

Saturday Afternoon
Late afternoon log on, take bard to NK, offer to pay for res or revive (I've
just about managed to stay in 42 but getting to my corpse is more important
to me than exp, I can make the exp back but I kinda need my body for it) Log
back to Primary and try for a port, nothing coming, go wait at Dragon portal
for someone to come in, ask to leave with him. He kindly takes me NK (at
last) and refuses the my donation (thankyou) start to loot corpse when a
51st cleric wanders passed and offers to resurrect me (there's a stroke of
luck) Leaves before I can donate (Run by res'ing, Thanks Docc) Still no
spiders in EK :ï¿½/

Saturday Late Evening/Early hours
Do some shopping, pick up some DF arms for 200 (Ha! And I get told that my
300 - 400 offers were to low) A DF BP for 900 (not too cheap but if I want
the item I don't like messing the seller around) and a few other bits
(cheap) to help out some guild mates. Spend rest of night travelling the
globe with Bard, playing Santa Clause.

Sunday Morning - Sunday Late afternoon
Again, the idea of getting some silk but a few Guild mates are going to hunt
in DL, go with them and drop in and out of group (stop for food and breaks
from PC)
Make 43 (Wow, Saturday morning and I'm nearly 41 again now I've levelled,
unexpected bonus) The cleric makes 2 levels as does the other warrior (as I
said, I took breaks, can't play for that time solid) Nothing much for rest
of day. I have some more bits for my bard to deliver (maybe tonight). A few
items to sell in bazaar. Then I'll prolly head back to DL.

Nothing exciting but certainly a far more successful weekend than I
expected.
I should now concentrate on getting to 45th (I've been told it makes 40 look
like a walk in the park) but I'm such a lazy/slow leveller I may just "Hang
out" for a bit.

Oh well, just thought I'd share that with you
The main point, that I didn't really get across was that it restored my
faith in people (sitting in EC Bazaar can make you more than a little jaded,
seems to bring out the worst in players, me included) I'd forgotten how
helpful some can be without asking for any reward.
