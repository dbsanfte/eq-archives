The 60 paladin I used to team up with retired, and it's rarely a
matter of being able to pick and choose as a druid doing pickup
groups. The main tank might not be too high level or too well dressed,
and if I am the only healer in that group, I prefer my job being as
easy as possible :) 
Also, I know the pain of going /lfg and don't mind adding a nice 6th
person to a functioning 5 player group; it gives more people the
chance to get something out of their playtime. (The 6th has to be
nice, mind you. And same goes for adding a 5th to a 4 man group)
