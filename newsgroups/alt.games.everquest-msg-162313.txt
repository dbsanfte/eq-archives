To me this comes across as a little ignorant. Just because you aren't 
particularly attached to your name (I mean "Lionoo" isn't a particularly 
creative name for a cat) it doesn't mean a lot of other players aren't.

I personally have spent at least a few hours while on a train etc tossing names 
around in my head and playing with the alphabet to think up a name which will 
represent my character in the way I want it to.

To have a GM come along and simply take it for themselves is despicable and an 
absolute abuse of power!
