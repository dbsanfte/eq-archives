I was warmly before going to VP.  After 6 dragon kills and 6 faction
hits, I'm so freaking KOS, if she could, she would zone to chase after
my butt.  

One VP dragon kill == 4 days in Mistmoore AoEing.

I've since racked up about 2 dozen more VP dragon faction hits at
least...I've given up trying to repair my faction with her.
