the reason i ask is because ive just reached lvl10 of being a paladin and im
pretty intent on going farther at an online game. however i want to be sure
i have picked the right one, ive not tried ultima properly and for the
amount of time im going to invest on a game (i can only afford to run one) i
have to be sure ive picked the right one. i just like the sound of ultima
but that doesnt mean i havent enjoyed playing everquest these past few
weeks.
