Thank you for your help(?) Mom er ah Halfpole.  What I am
going to do is collect lots of gnoll teeth (if I can survive
the many trains in BB).  Then I will take all of my gear,
other than a couple days food and water, and put it in the
bank.  Thus my body will have nothing on it if I get killed
(I will lose the gold she gives me for the teeth but the
higher rep is most important to me anyway).  I will post my
results here in case any other Necro would like to know.
Agaib thanks for your reply.
