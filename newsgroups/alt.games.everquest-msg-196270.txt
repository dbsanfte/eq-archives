Grim aura and the shielding line are both self-only buffs.  You can tell
because they have a yellow spell gem.  As a necro, most of the buffs you get
will be self-only.  You get Focus Death at level 12, that's the first in
your pet buff line, and you get Spirit Armor at level 16, which can also be
used on your pet.  To see what buffs your pet currently has, type "/pet
report health" minus the quotes (make a hotkey for that command, it's very
useful).

Check out http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Necromancer for the
rest of your spell lineup.
