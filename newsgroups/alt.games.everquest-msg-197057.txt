Err, twink a Ranger with similar gear to your Shaman and he'll make a
better tank.  My level 15 Paladin Frog twink was tanking Paludal mobs
just fine _unslowed_.

Can my low 50s Shaman tank better than my Ranger could at the same
age?  Well, yes she can, because Turgur's makes almost any mob into a
whimpering puppy AND mudflation means she has better gear at that age
than he ever had.  Once I find time to quest for mini-Torpor she'll
be even better equipped to 'tank' stuff.
