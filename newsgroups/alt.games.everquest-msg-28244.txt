They could certainly "perform" the ceremony, after all, it's basically just
a role-playing event.  Sure a GM has to change the names afterwards, but
anyone could perform a wedding - hell, my paladin has presided over a
wedding before, being the most "priest-like" person in attendance.

Back to the original topic, my guild's guildmistress was married in a
same-sex wedding about 2 years ago on the Cazic-Thule server.  A GM
performed the wedding, and two guides were present as well during the
wedding and reception.
