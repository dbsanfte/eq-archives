Containers (backpacks, sewing kits, bags, dimensional pockets, and so on) 
cannot be put inside containers.

Dimensional pockets and holes (and spirit pouches and probably any other 
summoned container) are NO RENT.  NO RENT objects disappear off your 
character 30 minutes after you camp off or go link dead.  So if you have 
stored anything in them, they disappear into the great beyond also.  This 
applies to about every summoned item; I cannot think of any summoned items 
that aren't NO RENT.

Hope this helps.
