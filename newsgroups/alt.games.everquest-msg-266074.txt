I popped over to the WoW forums, and looked over the EQ2 vs WoW
threads.  I know that, obviously, they're going to prefer WoW, but
some of the crap that was spouted made me more firm in my decision to
go with EQ2.

One guys actually made fun of EQ2's quests, saying "It's all go kill
wolves and spiders <YAWM> nothing new".  What makes it funny (as
anyone who tried the WoW beta will know) is that EVERY quest you get
when starting WoW is a "Kill X creatures" or "get me X wolf hides".

So far so similar, yet EQ2 is insulted on that basis, and WoW is
applauded ?

Odd, and annoying.
