With decent poison resists, he is not too bad, but we do usually do Trak 
with levels 55 to 63.  Last time we did Trak, the adds got us, after we 
killed Trak.  Be sure to have a cleric or paladin in each group to cast 
group heals.  Be sure to have people with their best cure poison spell up 
as it will be needed when Trak is down to prevent a lot of additional 
deaths.  Bards are great for this with their resist song going (great for 
most of the dragons actually).
