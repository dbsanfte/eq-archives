Great place for exp.  A few mistakes, though (IM[NS]HO)

Here's how my necro made it from 21 to 24 in very short time in Paludal...
Set up camp on the ramp past the first bandit camp.  There is a ledge
overlooking an Elder Sensate Reishi (one of those giant shrooms).  This is a
great place to med as nothing will wander past you (only if you get trained
which is rare).  There are 4 easy spawn to pull on 5 minute timers:
#1 is the wandering Patog Fiend that will walk down the path and stop to
your right outside of aggro range.
#2 is the static Patog at the top of the ramp.
#3 The Sensate Reishi at your feet (will not aggro unless attacked)
#4 Bandit on the island just across from you.

Spell lineup is:
Darkness
Shadow Vortex
Leach
Tap
Fear
Heart Flutter
Feign Death
Shielding/Focus Death/Spirit Armor/Allure of Death (swap as needed)

Pull with Darkness, send in pet, Vortex, Fear, Leach, HF, med.  Tap as
needed.  All the kills are easy and you should have no deaths.

Once you hit 23, you can start single/double pulls from the camp.   pull one
w/ darkness and high-tail it to your (parked) pet.  When you get back to
pet, FD (if you have 2) then assist pet and Darkness (if second bandit) and
follow the above.  Fear any adds (they run away from the camp if you get
close to the Reishi).

I had only one death in the caverns and that was because some idiot claimed
the entire bandit camp (which the could not keep clear) and bitched up a
storm in ooc about my stealing bandits (I was single pulling the loner near
the lake and the one on the island).  They trained about 4 or 5 bandits on
me and FD kept getting interrupted.  Needless to say I went down fast
(necros are not tanks, no matter what your father said about being a "real
man").

Anyway, fast experience, terrible loot.  You will need to find the words for
your level 24 spells at vendors or friends.  At 24 I moved to Echo and hit
the Needlite room (forget vortex and flutter, add Banshee Aura).

Forget about Siphon Str (waste of time/mana/spell slot).  Swap in pet heals
and Cure Disease as necessary (3 Cures will get rid of spreading Crud).
Sitting pets will regen even with Spreading Crud (it's 1 hp per tick, I
think, maybe 2).


Good Hunting!  (Just wait til 29 when you can solo in SolA, thats where the
loot will start dropping).
