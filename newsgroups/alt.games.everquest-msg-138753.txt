This is definitely a heat-related issue. Check the airflow in your case. If
you have an ASUS motherboard, use PC Probe to check the temp inside your
case. Open up the case and make sure the video card fan is running when the
comp is on. If it is, check to make sure it's running properly.

You may have a faulty fan, or a faulty card. Also check (though I doubt it)
that your card isn't overclocked in any way; this can create too much heat
for the normal methods to dissipate.
