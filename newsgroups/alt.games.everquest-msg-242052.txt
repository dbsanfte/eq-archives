And the grotesque server lag (up to 2 second latency that is not
attributable to ping time and varies greatly between zones), did
they bother to deal with that?  It's obvious they're aware of it.
The worst I've seen was running a lowbie around GFay, the mobs
there were moving very slowly, presumably as a half-assed attempt
to make the zone playable despite the problem (and, as is usual
with all things EQ, the situation greatly favors casters, no need
for Snare or SoW to kite when the mobs are already effectively
snared).
