    There's a nice screenshot on my guild's site. We'd just wiped to AoW,
and people were about to camp back in. One enchanter had invised herself
before camping, so she went in first. Looked around, and told the guild "He
despawned". The very next lines of text after "He despawned" are the AoW
giving her the beating of a lifetime. Apparently the message was going to be
longer than "He despawned", but she got killed while typing and hit return
out of reflex.
