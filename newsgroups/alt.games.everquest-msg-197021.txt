If you are comparing a low level troll shaman with a lot of STA to a low
level <anything> ranger with average STA, of course the shaman can sponge
better.  It has everything to do with the races available to a shaman
(most with good starting STA) compared to the races available to the
ranger and nothing to do with the class, inherently.  At low levels
before the HP difference based on class becomes noticeable, I'd say the
two classes are equal.  But make it a troll shaman vs a wood elf
ranger...ok, I vote for the shaman. :)  Froglok shaman vs halfling ranger,
though...ok, wow, those are both so annoying I'll pass on making that
decision.

personally, I've always had a very straight-forward approach to the choice
of a sponge.  Compare HP/AC/regen.  Whoever has the over-all best combo
wins the honor of being beaten into a pulp.  

Basing who should sponge based on who needs to learn it for later in their
career...that is a seperate argument.  And I'm not sure I'd go along with
it more than half the time, simply because sometimes I like to enjoy the
ride and not always see my activities at "training".  I'm Foxeye, damnit,
not Half_elf_ranger_39465!
