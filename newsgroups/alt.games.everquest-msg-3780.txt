I think the perception it costs less has more to do with the mana
efficiency of the spells. I don't play a Druid so I will give a couple
Shaman examples. At level 8, Shamen get a Dot, Tainted Breath. It
costs 40 mana, does 10 damage initially, then 8 damage for 7 ticks for
a total damage of 66 damage. That makes 1.66 damage per point of mana
spent. At level 12, the DD Spirit Strike does a maximum of 81 damage
for 75 mana, or 1.08 damage per mana. At 19, Affliction does 30 damage
plus 6 per 21 ticks for a total of 156 for a cost of 75 mana, or 2.08
damage per mana.

I think you will find, if you run both styles for a couple fights,
that what really happens is closer to Dot battle takes two minutes
with two minutes downtime, DD battle takes one minutes with 5 minutes
downtime. As in your example, these are just sample numbers, just to
indicate the trend.
