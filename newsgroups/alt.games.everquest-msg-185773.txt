Well, only the Group Leader can use it (the icon disappears if you
join a group).  I understand why they did it this way but it would
have been better if you could view people LFG while in a group. 
Sometimes the Group leader is busy with other stuff and can't devote
time to it.

The other thing that would help is to release this to all users.  It
was pretty cheezy to require LOY for it.  But this is the new pattern
Sony is going for (no drop spells, interface changes, etc).

I guess the next expansion will add 4 spell gems to those that buy it
(this would guarantee that everyone would buy it).
