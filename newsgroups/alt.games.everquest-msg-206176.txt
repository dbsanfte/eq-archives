You haven't done much to me directly, especially if your character for sale
isn't on Povar, though I don't care for your selling the character at all.
I will not spam your email address nor do anything else against you.  YOU
posted your real email address on Usenet, therefore YOU have made it
available to the email harvesters, and hence, to the spammers.  They'll be
emailing to ask if you'd like a bigger penis and better credit over and over
and over again starting very soon.  Sorry about that, but them's the breaks.
You only have yourself to blame.
