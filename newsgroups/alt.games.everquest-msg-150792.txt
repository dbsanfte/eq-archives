There is a limit as the others have noted, but this really only applies to
folks browsing EVERYTHING at the bazaar. If some is looking for a specific
item (i.e.: Emerald Dragon Scale Tunic) then you'll make the list.

Making a few seperate queiers with more specific parameters will give you
views that will show a better cross-section of what is being sold.

Good luck!
