Yes.  On the bright side, its simple enough to skip over, and bandwidth 
on this newsgroup really isn't a problem.

Or... no.  When I can't find anything new to say, I might skip a few 
patches before the fact that the same old same old still hasn't been 
repaired bubbles back up to high enough pressure requiring me to vent in 
some way.

Thus far, I've found something new or different each patch, either SOE 
changing its behavior, or me finding some facet I'd overlooked 
previously, or acting on new information based on something someone else 
says.

If you just chalk it up to venting, agree or disagree quietly to 
yourself and don't post a reply, you're looking at one post per patch, 
hardly a big deal even if you can't stop yourself from reading it.

Complain, and I'll likely have a reply to address your complaint.  We 
can end up putting more posts up about their crappy information system 
than about any other facet of the game.

If it helps, I also post a bunch about other facets of the game that 
interest me, my signal to noise ratio is pretty good even if you count 
all posts about the patch info system as noise.
