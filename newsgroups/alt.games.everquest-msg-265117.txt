   I have to say I agree with DT here.  I am an altaholic.  I love trying
new races/class/themes.  Being limited to only four per account?  That
would be just painful.  

   I am sorta on the fence about buying the game, now.  I want to see it,
to make up my own mind.  But I know I don't want to play any game that
encourages me to camp for items, or has significant downtime.  I dunno if
EQII really does this, but since these are the main reasons I left EQL, I
am sorta wary about EQII.  Now this news, four characters only.

   I just don't see the point to this.  My gut feeling, given SoE's past
performance, is that they are at some point going to sell additional
character slots or bundle the to expansions as a carrot.  This "let's
squeeze every penny we can out them!" attitude was a big turn off in EQL,
for me, and I don't really like seeing hints of it in EQII.

   At this point, I don't know if I am going to try the game or not.
