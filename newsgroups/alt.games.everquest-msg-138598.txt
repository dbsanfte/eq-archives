    I've snipped a lot of specifics out, but this is exactly what I'm
talking about. If all you want is XP, then warriors solo well. They have to
pick their mobs, but so do other solo classes.

    Jazz - how many places are quaddable? Can you run out, regardless of
where you are, and gather four mobs and blow them to smithereens? I'm gonna
answer my own question - no. The number of places you can solo effectively
(reasonable XP/unit time) with your wizard is limited. The same thing is
true of a warrior. The one additional limitation placed on warriors is they
can get creamed if they try and solo stuff out of that "effective range",
whereas a true solo class like a wizard can pull a big mob, nuke it down,
then sit on their ass a while and make a mental note to not aggro those
things again. With my warrior in DSP, that mob is wolves - I can kill a wolf
most of the time, or almost all the time with certain buffs, but it's a poor
choice for XP and a blood-starved wolf will send me running for zone.

    Hey! It's not THAT bad - it's just average, which was what I wanted to
show. An average person being able to reproduce my results.

    Actually, the other warriors in FG aren't Dachunker. Dach got his points
all over the place - he used to rip apart Centis in Akheva before the NPC
caster change, for example. He, and the people killing shrooms, use the fact
that caster mobs cast a lot of spells that are completely resistable almost
all of the time, and spend a lot of time doing so. *I* solo shrooms, as a
cleric, by standing in one place and chain-casting my nuke on them while
they swat me. They are level 46-49 mobs. The only thing that lets me do this
is shrooms spend a ton of time trying to cast useless effects on me that I
resist 90% of the time. I choose my targets, like any soloist does. There's
a reason places like wyverns in CS, raptors in TD, hermit in SK etc. are
always camped.

    She's been soloing most of her career, though. Went 35 to 40 or
thereabouts doing Ancient Croc in Upper Guk and the dead side zone area in
Lower Guk. I've seen other, braver warriors go and do the bedroom area,
which I would sneak pulls from every so often as well. Then, when I
relocated to the moon for twinking purposes, the first mob I found that was
low blue was soloable. Am I just lucky?
