No, I meant they could have done this from the start with all new
items (from Kunark expansion).  There would have been no nerf cry
since things would have started off unequippable by those under the
minimum level.

The only two conclusion you can reach is:

1.  They didn't think it's a problem.
2.  Or did weren't aware of it being a problem--which is hard to
accept since the whole twink vs. no twink has been around since before
Kunark.
