Go with your first instincts. Working towards that myself. SCFM rocks.
One of the nicest AA's any caster could ask for.

You've pretty much answered your own question right there. Since
Manaburn was nerfed, it allegedly doesn't crit anymore, because it's
"technically" a DOT. (I say allegedly, as obviously I don't have it, but
just go by what I read on Graffe's.) With your 4K manpool, which is
quite nice, I guess you might expect to occasionally see a nearly 10K
burn. More likely to average in the 8 to 9K range though. That's....
what? Less than you'd do with four Sunstrikes, and you'd be totally OOM.

Up to you, but I'd have to say no. I plan on getting it, (see below) but
it's way down the list of AA priorities.

Only if you can find some yellow or red mobs that have less than, oh...
about 6K of HP. And I don't know many level sixtyone and up mobs that
have less than that. Even then you're looking at the occasional death,
because I *believe* (don't quote me on this) that manaburn has the
unpleasant ability to do as little as 1.1 times your manapool.  It might
be 1.5 though. Either way, you're looking at the possibility of the
occasional burn for somewhere between 4100 and 6K. And if the mob has
6.5K, then you're going to be butt OOM, helpless as a baby, and have a
VERY angry and highly singed 6K HP mob on your hands. The good part is
that it should be over quickly. :-)

Manaburn on raids:  There is still a place in some guilds' raid tactics
on particular long fight mobs for manaburn. It's a virtually zero aggro
attack (or at least it used to be. Not sure now.) so for some encounters
the raid would have a wizard open up with a burn to "soften the mob up"
then just work on getting mana up for a while however they could. (Mod
rod, even post nerf. Necro twitching. Whatever you can manage. With KEI
and a horse you can still med up a respectable amount of mana during the
fight and get back into it for the kill.)

If it's a really long fight, you can have several wizards slip in a burn
here and there, thus knocking off some big chunks of HP on the mob. So
with that in mind, I dont' think it's *entirely* useless, but it's
nothing like it was in its glory days. There are other, better AA's for
wizzies, IMO, and you've already identified one of the best.
