Just a small comment on this idea.  I am going to give you a choice here.  I
will either chop off your right hand, or your entire right arm.  You have no
other choice.  Which is better?  Point being, the entire argument of "it
could be worse" to me is foolish.  Between those two choices, if I just
chopped off your hand, I could blithely look you in the face and tell you it
could be worse.  But it would still be a bitch to lose your hand.  YES it
could be worse, but it could also be a lot better.
