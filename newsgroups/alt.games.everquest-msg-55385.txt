Hehe, gotta be luck for that one.
1 cast of spell = 200 mana
then 20 cast of spell = 4000 mana.

Take my druid 20 min of medding to get that mana, dont think youll get it fro
free. Payed 2pp a cast when i needed vials.

Why do we go to IllOmen? Buy the poison vials from Toxdill in WFP, use DE
Illusion and Alliance to get best prices. Then you buy the pearls in the
chanter guild.

Hehe, good luck finding a druid in BB that wanna run all the way to Gfay to
WF  you. Wolf Form break when you zone.

You dont sound like you have played a chanter. its 4000 mana to make the
vials.
