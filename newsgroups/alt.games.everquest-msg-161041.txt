The people buying the padding are likely using it to make some of the high
end armor that sells for quite a few k per piece, so 100pp for the padding
is peanuts in the overall cost to make it.  It's worth it to them to not
have to farm the greens.  Likely what was happening is another seller bought
you out, and marked them up to the more traditional price, and made a pretty
penny off them for almost no work at all.
