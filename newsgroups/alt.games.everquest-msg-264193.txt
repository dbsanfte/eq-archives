I have never played a MMORPG on release day that was finished. Most were far
from it.
Blizzard, because of their sterling record are held to a higher standard
than most if not all other MMORPG companies.
And that's fine. But you know what I'll take bets that this game gets
on-going attention and polish like no other mmorpg to date...Any takers on
the bet?
They are being rushed(out of Blizzard's hands)but they will make up ground
after release...From all accounts WoW in its present state is way ahead of
most a month after release....

WoW and Blizzard have absolutely nothing to worry about....
EQ2 will have its market share, but it wont hurt WoW in the least....
