Although this is true, fails don't seem to affect skill increase
rates at all.  Since you can buy a couple backpack loads
of both bat wings (EC) and Fish (WC) and cart them
off with you to work on in your spit while you hunt, this
is more convenient, since you won't find yourself stuck
with large quantities of frosting.

For a simpler path up from 135, by the way, try Frost
Giant Steaks and Storm Giant Steaks.  STR +4 STA+1,
make 5 at a swat if you cart your meat off to Cobalt Scar...
where you can make the (trivial at 85 unfortunately)
Drake Pickles.  +2 WIS +2 INT, make 2 per meat.  Between
the two, you'll be producing some really nice usable food,
just remember to keep force feeding yourself fish rolls so
you don't accidentally eat whichever your choice of
foods was.   At any rate those Frostie Steaks will get you
quite a bit further along.
