Take another look at Paul's message. It's not so much about the 
tradeskilling itself, it's about the meta game of resource collecting. That 
still may not be your thing but it is a whole other world of activity that 
has its own significant rewards and rules of engagement, and definitely and 
easily soloable. There's something very satisfying about working up each of 
your respective gathering skills to enable finding the resources that are in 
demand. And when you happen upon one of the really valuable rares, you have 
the choice of profitting enormously (you can sell most of them for multiple 
gold) or having a very powerful item made up for yourself by a crafter.
