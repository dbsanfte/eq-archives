}Actually this is kinda wrong. Many species are far closer to extinction than
}you might realize. Many more species have had their populations decimated.

If you need specific examples beyound whales and the ivory trade, 
there's vicuna (hunted to near extinction because they have really really 
soft pelts), buffalo (yummy), rhinoceros (powdered rhino horn's good for 
the libido, don'tcha know) and quite a few more.  And we haven't even 
considered non-mammals yet.  But nobody cares about them because they 
aren't fuzzy and cute.

}Human intervention is one of the primary causes of both the depletion and
}erradication. On the other hand it probably dosent matter much since it is
}fairly clear that species are supposed to go extinct all the time . You look
}for fossils and almost all of those species have no living members today.

The 'primary cause' assertion is very hard to justify.  There are very 
mixed estimates as to what a natural rate of extinction would be.  Humans 
are a cause of some extinction, no doubt, but probably not as many as they 
are accused of.  It seems that if a species is becoming endangered, and 
there is even a hint of a possible human cause, people tend to grab on to 
that as the one and only reason, ignoring all others.  I think we should 
do what we reasonably can to avoid wiping out other species, but we should 
realize that not every extinction is our fault.

}When I was young fish was considered a lower class food. Now it is
}considered as a luxory food. Since I love fish this is somewhat annoying :)

Bah, that's just because fish tastes better now than it did when you were 
young. :)
