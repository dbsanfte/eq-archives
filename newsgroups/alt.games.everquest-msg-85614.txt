I got shocked the other day.  My Warrior has been grouping with the same 
group since Dalnirs and 2 of the people since the early Sarnak fort.  Those 
2 people have "been around" and play -very- well, and bow have level 55 
alts that seem to be quite respected.

We were in CoM and our regular Monk was gone for a week, and we had someone 
join in the group.  They asked about loot, so I told them I was 
masterlooting.  The other Warrior ( one of the 2 original people, the other 
is the cleric ) said "and the Peridots go to the Cleric.", which is what we 
normally do so she can start building up a collection now for later on.

The guy asked why she gets the Dots, and the Warrior responded that she 
needs them for a later buff.  I chimed in that Chanters can use them, too.  
Both the Warrior and Cleric said "What?", so, I told them that one of the 
Runes takes them - Rune IV I thought.

Neither of them knew that.  Is Rune IV not used very much at the high 
levels?
