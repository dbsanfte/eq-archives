My little level 6 halfling rogue is in Velious. Why? ..... Curiosity. I
wanted to see what it looks like over there. so I've been hiding and
sneaking my way around over there. :)

It's kind of funny. All these super high level people keep trying to kill me
just cause they don't like my race (I'm on a PvP server) and all that ever
happens is that I get a message that so-and-so tried to cast a spell on me
and I was protected.
