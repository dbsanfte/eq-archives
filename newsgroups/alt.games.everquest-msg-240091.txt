Not true.  Check out Coprolith's Study on the Beastlord Forum:
http://www.beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=211

There was been some arguing on Paladins of Norrath whether this
indicates that the combat engine has changed since the studies
that showed STR as unimportant several years ago.  It may be that
the old studies involved mobs whose AC was outside the critical
range where ATK vs. AC matters a lot (well known on the flip side,
gave rise to the notion of the AC soft cap).  If the old tests (no
longer available) involved only mobs with AC too high or too low
for ATK changes to effect damage much (i.e. a large proportion of
hits at minimum or maximum damage) then only a very large change
in STR would have had an effect.  Testing done by Paladins unable
to crack 1000 ATK, for example, wouldn't show much change against
even moderately high AC mobs when adding 80 or 100 STR.
