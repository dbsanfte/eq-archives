In game, Infravision will give you night vision with a slighlty reddish
tinge to things, mainly creatures. Ultravision should make night seem like
early dusk and, yes, does have a blueish tinge to everything.

From my experience the Ultravision spells never seem to match up with my
DE's sight with which I have often not noticed night fall. Not exactly sure
why that is, maybe I am expecting more when my normaly night blind Shaman
casts it on herself.

Not ever played a Vah Shir so I can't say what level of infravision they
have, Half-Elves infravision (and Ogres/Trolls as I recall) is not up to the
standard of High/Wood Elves so maybe Vah Shir have a similar level.
