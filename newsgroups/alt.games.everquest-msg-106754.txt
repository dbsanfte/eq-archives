Good thing you limited it to the spires, though - if you had just said
port locations every wizard who decided to test their new Tishan's
Relocation spell for the first time would have gone into involuntary
muscle spasms and twitches from the memory.

It's better now, though. Once apon a time you could port in and find
no less than seven chromodracs hovering in aggro range of the port-in
spot, along with a host of Wurms, Wyverns, and spermies....

    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
