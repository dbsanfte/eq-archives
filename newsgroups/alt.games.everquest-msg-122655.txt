Sure, but be prepared - linguistics textbooks are damnably expensive.
You might want to go with "Swearing: a Social History of Foul
Language, Oaths and Profanity in English" by Geoffrey Hughes.  That's
often accompanied by "Social History of English" by McCrum & Cramm.
If you're feeling a bit frisky, you can try to crack "Language and
Social Life " by Montgomery and Reid-Martin.

There's some fairly interesting, albeit anecdotal correlation between
the use of profanity and violence.  For exaampl,e Southport High
School  in Southport, Indiana prohibited swearing and enforced it
under a "verbal violence" rule. Fighting has dropped off markedly.

If you can find it, The May Clinic's Dr. Walter Alvarez  did an
interesting study on the correlation of profanity and violence.  This
has also been uncovered as a primary tactic in Zimbardo's Model of
DeInvidivualization

Why would you operate from the assumption that it's those who dislike
profanity who need changing?

Intelligence expression, commensurate with a decent level of
education.

Umm. Yes, indeed.

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
