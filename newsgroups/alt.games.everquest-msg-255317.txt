In other words - they put the time in.  So, yes, they do deserve
better gear than those who don't.

Also, newer raid content isn't the old afk for 1 hr, nuke on demand
then afk again.

OTOH - rampant mudflation has made it from markedly better gear
(see Hate/Fear gear vs. the other gear available in the orginal
EQ) to vastly better gear (by an order of magnitude).
