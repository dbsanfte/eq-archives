I agree with Chainbreaker, those of us who like to explore, and 
find those spiffy question mark items on the ground, or forage 
[if it is still in the game=)] and kill along the way can still 
have fun, and take the transport if we find we have to get there 
faster.  Right now, I will frequently run somewhere instead of 
trying to get a port, though I will get a port if I need to be 
somewhere fast. I *like* exploring=)
