Unplayable? No, but significantly slower. 

The reason I stated 30% faster was due to the fact that I was able to
switch on high textures, mip mapping, and dynamic lighting under
options and still see a significant performance boost. (ie 90% of the
"stutters" running through West FreePort with clipping maxed out
eliminated)

I guess seeing is believing. I recommend that anyone running WinME
with access to Win98SE (and the inclination) give it a try. I am sure
they will see an improvement.

Cheers
