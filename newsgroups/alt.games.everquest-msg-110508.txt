    If you are lucky, there will be a ranger or druid nearby. Sontalak can
be Harmonied, and when this happens you can squeeze by him on the left hand
side (facing Sont from outside the tunnel) by hugging the tunnel wall. At
least at level 60, anyways. It's always fun running by a max scowls mob that
would smear you in seconds if it knew you were there.
