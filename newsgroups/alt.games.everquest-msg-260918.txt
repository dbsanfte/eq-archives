So, I wiped EQClient again, then went in to options, where I found every 
single model turned on, and all the animations et al also turned on 
except for texture compression.  Graphics were set to medium and 640*800.

I fooled around with a lot of these, then tried to play and boom, same 
problem as before.

Thinking back, during the patch I'd gone in and changed something, can't 
recall what, one of the models from luclin to pre luclin or something.

Apparantly there's something about changing the EQCLient file thats 
getting messed up.  I wonder how playable the game is going to be set 
the way it comes by default.
