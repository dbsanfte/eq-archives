Hi folks!

I am trying to start a roleplaying guild for evil races on the Morrel-Thule
server. I want it on this board becuase I have several characters on it from
levels 10-26.  A message board/website for the guild is finished. I need at
least 10 people to help me form it.

    The guild is one I am hoping will be able to have guild raids every
other week; will be a place for groups to be easily formed, and questing
help will be available.

    If you enjoy playing in -character and want to help in the formation of
this guild, please respond to this post.
