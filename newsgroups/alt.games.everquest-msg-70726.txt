Have you ever tried it? Go on, try it. Buy an OEM CD and see if you
can get it to upgrade your installation with a full hard drive, even
when deleting these files (all of which I am quite familiar with,
BTW). Hell, we had people call in who we'd work with for hours before
we managed to worm the fact that they'd borrowed or bought a CD from
their friends. I can't recall off the top of my head what the error
messages were (this was over 2 years ago) but even the Microsoft
version of the KB (there's a LOT more to it than is on the web site
that is only available to partners and inside technicians) didn't give
any solutions. Of course, Microsoft probably wouldn't. After that
little revelation, we didn't have to work with them anymore. 

Different OEMs do different things to their CDs. The other problems
with OEM CDs still stand. They are generally tailor made by the
manufacturer to the computer they come with. CD installs the wrong
drivers for your mobo resources? Your USB don't work because the
computer it originally came with didn't have USB ports?  Whoops!
