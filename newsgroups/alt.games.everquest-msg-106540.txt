For anyone who is dyslexic (or has any other learning disability) and
college-bound, I would like to point to the book "Learning Outside the
Lines". This book was written by two Brown University students, one with
Attention Deficit Disorder (which I have) and the other with Dyslexia. The
book is geared towards people with any "learning disability" (I hate that
term). It give tips on adapting to the special needs you have as a student
(eg hints on note taking).

The book was published in 2000, three years into my college education, I
wish it had been available when I first started.
