Each mob has a particular magic resistance, and that is modified by relative
level. Some spells cut through magic resistance better than others. The
druid dots are very good at curring through magic resistance. As you have
noticed, snare quite often gets resisted. Oddly in all my quad kiting, I
have NEVER had bonds of tunare resisted (lvl 57 aoe snare). If you run
eqcaster.exe, it shows what various spells save against (fire, cold, magic
etc), and what modifier for that spell.

I doubt if gorge hounds have higher magic resistance than other mobs of
their level. Mobs ive noticed to have high magic resitance are:
Crystal statues, sentinals, destroyers in velks
Most things in plane of hate (priests especially, possibly due to self
buffs)
POP mobs
