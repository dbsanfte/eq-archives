Dain 1 runs similar to Dain 3, in that you select from a list of 
characters and zone in to GD.  But instead of directing and assisting an 
army, your group is out on its own, making a grand tour of the zone. 
You go to a series of locations, each of which has a set of mobs, kill 
the leader of each, and you can move on to the next.  The Dain is with 
you, and if at any time he dies, you lose the mission.

These fights are much easier than the Dain 3 ones, run them right and my 
"cleric" was able to do some things other than chain mash Perfect 
Heal... do them wrong and I was root parking and stunning and burning 
thru DA... yep, lots more to do than chain PHeal, but usually this ended 
up as a wipe.

We used a variety of strategies, the only one that worked was to have 
the berserker kite the groups of giants away while the leader was 
tagged, and then once he was dead the berserker would grab the next 
group and repeat (this was on 2 and 3).  Any plan involving tanking the 
whole group or off tanking the scouts etc invariably ended in disaster.

This could have been a question of player skill, though, the initial 
group I was in kicked thru Dain 3 twice and Dain 1 once, all three 
successes, then several people got replaced and we started failing. 
Since the first group consisted of 5 competant people plus me, this may 
have had some effect.

Here's the thing with fails.  No reward, no exp, no skill ups, nothing. 
  At least no tasktimer, so you can run another right away.  But in 
normal EQ there's usuallys some consolation even in defeat; not here. 
Even the Military Swords I looted off some of the giant bodies didn't 
come out with us, succeed or fail (they would have made good pet weapons).

Worst was a Dain 3 run in which we wiped out, the army managed to kill 
the General while we were on the way back, and we couldn't find the 
body.  We'd had this happen several times, but ordinarily I was able to 
find it by targetting a coldain and assisting (funny the tricks you 
learn playing EQ all these years); this time, nothing.  Anyway, this 
means no looting the shards of wisdom, so no exp, and of course no seal 
portion or loot item.  But insult to injury, we DID get the lockout 
timer, making this the worst fail yet!
