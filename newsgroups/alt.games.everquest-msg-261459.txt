Burning Affliction increases DoT damage, so is an obvious must have for a 
necro. Burning Affliction II would cover spells up to level 44 (so would 
fit your 'useful to level 45' criteria, and it's available on those crappy 
old serpentine bracers that you see a million of in the bazaar.

The Fine Antique Corset quest in PoK results in a spell haste II item and 
is similarly easy to complete by buying stuff in the bazaar, *if* you can 
lay your hands on a yew leaf (otherwise it's a case of running around 
Wakening Lands for a couple of hours looking for a ground spawn or trying 
to forage one).
