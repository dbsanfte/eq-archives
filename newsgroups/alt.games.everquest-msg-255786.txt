To elaborate on Dark Tyger's take; I was on the Dawn Shard of Istaria
(Horizons) when we opened up the Satyr as a playable race.  It involved a
TON of mining, harvesting, and building, functions of trade skills (the
trade skills system was incredible, absolutely nothing like it out there
anywhere, sadly, its PvE content was lacking).  As well as a ton of monster
beating to finish.

The community had to band together gather raw materials, then to ferry these
raw materials to the refining areas, and lastly the finished products had to
be carried to the mine sites (there where four separate sites) where others
had to incorporate the material into the structures.

Meanwhile, the Withered Aegis (The undead army that was the antagonist)
would mount attacks at varying times in order to interrupt the repair work
on the mines.  Some of the battles where amazing with some of the nastiest
undead on the face of Istaria sweeping through the mine area and wiping out
both defenders and crafters.

Needless to say, the feeling of community accomplishment when we finally
completed reconstructing the mines and passing through the buried portals,
was amazing.  Here we found new lands ruled by the Withered Aegis.  On each
island we discovered there was a machine used by the Aegis to oppress the
Satyrs.  Each of these had to be destroyed, but to do so each individual had
to have an augmentation applied to their weapon that changed the damage to a
specific type (different for each machine).  This augmentation was acquired
through a quest that also involved collecting some raw materials from each
island.  After your weapons where augmented, you had to fight your way to
the machine through hordes of the Aegis and while some beat on the machine,
others had to defend you from the swarming beasties.

It sounds very elaborate, and it was.  It took many people quite a bit of
effort to accomplish and we had fun doing it.  Many master craftsmen came
out of the building efforts, and many a level was gained trying to destroy
the machines.  It was the in depth, type of thing, that I always loved.
Sadly, Horizons is a crafter's heaven, not an adventurer's.

THAT is what an "unlockable" race should entail.
