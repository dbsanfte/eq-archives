When I was at the university, I had a unix account. The year I took
programming classes, they were in Simula. The following year, they
were in Java. Around that time, they decided to change the default
browser in our unix accounts to HotJava - aka. the worst piece of crap
I have ever seen. Most of us wasted no time in setting up our own
shortcuts to whatever flavor of Netscape we preferred.
