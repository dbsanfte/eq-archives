Yep, less points given out = less to keep track of = less work.

Was thinking something like:

1 dkp sign up on forum, eta if going to be late.
1dkp. being there at the begining of the raid.
2dkp per hour at the raid
1-10dkp for boss kill, 1dkp per attempt.


The first is trackable out of game, the second trackable with the raiddump
done at the start, the third by raid dump per hour and fourth by final raid
dump.

True that could happen, maybe a double blind bid system would be better.

Loot officer takes tells of bids, time limit 30seconds, after 30seconds max
bid on item is announced, 30 more seconds to give people a chance to raise
bids or drop out, loot is announced after one minute.

In that system being higher means you will win the loot if more than one
person enters.
