Yeah but barely, and It kinda depends upon taste. My guild went pro
dragon and still gets leet gear in TOV. It just depends on what you
think is the most leet. We finally decided that you can keep both
dwarves and dragons up easily while just killing giants in kael
sometimes since they are such huge faction pluses. Some of us even
kill dragon factions in skyshrine and of course woushi and such when
can and are still warmly. You just don't have that kind of freedom if
keeping giants faction high. 

Really the main thing not to do as a tunare worshipping wood elf druid
is ever set foot into pog with your guild killing there for whatever
reason. I did once for some corpse draggin with good faction and had
no problems because I was not grouped or buffing anyone. One faction
hit there even can be pretty bad.
