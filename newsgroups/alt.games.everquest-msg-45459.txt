It's in short supply because people refuse to hunt the mobs that load
them.

Level 55+ spells drop off, yep you guessed it, level 55+ mobs VERY
OFTEN.  Some level 50ish mobs in Skyfire can load level 55 spells but
are EXTREMELY rare.

Head down to the juggs/reets/shrooms in Seb, suckers drop spells like
candy.

Which is funny as hell since Wake of Karana is about the most useless
spell next to Beguile Plant.

Seriously, it stops rain (and only rain...if it's snowing you're shit
outta luck, Karana puckers up his sphincter when it gets below
freezing) for 400 mana and a 10pp reagent.  Whoopdie fucking do.

Which only reinforces the notion that most people are dumber than
dirt.  PotG, yes.  Regrowth of groves, yes.  Circle of Summer/Winter,
hell yes.  Egress/Succor, you betcha.  Target based cold AoE rain
nuke?  Yeah, that's useful...
