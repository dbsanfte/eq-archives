"Sony's $100 million in annual Everquest income (nearly all of it
profit)" - quote from the article 

i understand the expansions, the name changes, instant messenger,
legends server, server changes, and the game itself are all voluntary
costs. 

"Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, we
have increased our subscription rates. Effective April 25, the new
subscription rate is $12.95/month." - from the sony website
http://everquest.station.sony.com/rates/ 

...but what justified the rate hike if they're making nearly $100
million in profit.
