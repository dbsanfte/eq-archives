I've been offline a couple months now, but as of January there was no
Common on FV.  In fact, while there is a Human, its not what I'd call
"common", the Lingua Fraca seemed to be Elvish, which is odd, really,
because speaking Human creates less Spam:

Splendid says: this is shorter
vs
Splendid says (in Elvish): than this

I'd say Roleplay Lite, but the thing is there -are- roleplayers of
every stripe from "gadzooks, yon varlet's quite the knave" to "yo,
Adrian, I rolled a 6 on the d8, that means I gotta act Chaotic Nuetral
Today", and to whatever degree you want to see... you just have to
look for it.

Not that that's any different from any other server, there's the same
everywhere really, if you look hard enough.  You see more of it on FV,
and I think the reason for it is the other feature... while most
people still don't RP much at all, there's a lot more tolerance
towards the idea than on most of the other servers.

Most of this is a community thing, though, having little to do with
the rules set; TLC doesn't seem to encourage RP at all (and there's a
workaround, which is a good thing or many trade skills and quests
would be impossible) ... other than the fact that on Server Select it
says "roleplaying preferred" or something like that, I doubt it would
be any different than the other servers out there.
