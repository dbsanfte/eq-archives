Surely thats a function of AOE nukes, not DD ones?

My main is a 52 cleric, believe me I'm intimately familiar with the
concept of long med times.

Too, I've suffered thru soloing using root-nuke till it breaks, reroot...
snare nuke is like a godsend to me, since snare -never- breaks
prematurely.  I'm not against the idea of root per se, mind you,
just saying that at 21 it still wasn't functional, perhaps at 24?  Whens
the first replacement nuke?  Whens the second DOT?

My Necro has more DOTs than he can keep memmed alongside
snare, Fear, and the safety net FD.  Druid at the same level has
a grand total of one...which is, of course, one more than my
cleric has.

Srimp Scampi, 22 Druid
Bergh Brelltender, 52 Vicar
Shrouds, 21 Necro

and a host of others
