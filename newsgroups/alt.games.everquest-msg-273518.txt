Is frustration really the same as immersion?  I couldn't imagine only
having a couple hours to play, getting a /tell from a group of friends
to meet them in a zone that is forever away.  Get to the docks, barely
miss the boat and have to wait for the next one (I don't remember the
time, was it 15mins, 30mins?).  Then spend 30mins riding the boat.
Then run across however many zones to get to your friends.  Suddenly,
you are down to an hour or less of playing time.  Yay, immersion!

I could see them leaving the long way around, but not forcing it on
people.  If I want immersion in a fantasy world, I believe
teleportation supports that.  If others don't, I have nothing against
them spending an hour to get somewhere.  Please, don't keep unnecessary
timesinks in in the name of immersion though.
