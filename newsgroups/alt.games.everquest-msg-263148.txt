Thats what I took it to mean anyway, and I thought it was a good point.

If you want tribute points now, you destroy droppables, taking them out 
of the game.

No Drop items vanish from the game when you get better gear, so turning 
them into tribute doesn't help get rid of items.

But if you can get tribute from the No Drop items, then you can go back 
to selling droppables for pp, which means the droppables stay in the game.
