No problem, I understand your disappointment and the resulting passion that 
has fueled your messages. I think it speaks volumes about your character 
(and the quality of the EQ player base in general, could you imagine reading 
this in the Lineage 2 forums?) that you owned up to responsibility for your 
messages. Thank you.

This is one reason I use my real name when I post, it forces me to be held 
accountable for my message content. That's not always comfortable, as you 
know. ;-)
