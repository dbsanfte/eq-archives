What... the hell.

That's not the kind of broken that I was thinking of.

That's a picture of me under broken /dopropertinting (thx nudity) and
LoadVeliousArmorsWithLuclin

Only visible velious texture stuff that I'm wearing though is listed below;
Kromrif legs (tizmak texture on old models)
Nathsar arms (dark blue netted kelp on old models)
Coldain skin boots, but I don't know if those were normal leather or velious
leather.
Grey flesh gloves tint my hands grey there (exact same color as coldain skin
gloves) but I have no idea on the velious texturing of either one.
