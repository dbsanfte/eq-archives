that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Attributions show which quoted text belongs to whom. Leaving them out
makes people go back to old posts to find out who said what - posts
which may well have already been purged, since not every thread
consists of replies within minutes or hours of the post it is replying
to.

You obviously don't understand the difference between "can't do
threads" and "shouldn't need to go back and look at old posts if
people weren't clueless fucktards".
