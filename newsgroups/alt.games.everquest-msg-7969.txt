Great. 
Thanks all.
I have a lvl 51 druid powerleveling my warrior who is not lvl 13.
Kick and bash are only at 14 right now, taunt seems to go up very
quick and is now at 37.
1hs is now at 65.
I alternate between kick one time, then bash the next.
This is great as with my druid there, I can do constant kills and the
XP just pours in.
I am familiar with the warrior tactics, and have been playing EQ since
about a month before Kunark.
I just need to get a warrior up in levels now to go along with my
druid,necro, and wizard I have.
Is fun to play a melee class now after all the casting.

Thanks again.
