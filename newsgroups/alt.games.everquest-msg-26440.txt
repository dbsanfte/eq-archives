Heh... Tell me of a zone where that doesn't apply. :)

In fact, I keep /ooc on for two reasons. To amuse myself with the
idiots' banter as I mediate, and to catch offers of payment for ports.
Same goes for /shout, but I had to change the color to something closer
to /ooc. As far as I'm concerned, it's just two /ooc channels.

Speaking of which, I wish the /channel command wasn't bugged, and I
could turn the channels on or off without going to the main options
screen. >:(
