Well, it turns out that Druids do get a couple of worthwhile spells at 
51... The first Healing upgrade since our 20s and a new animal fear 
spell. This is great, since Terrorize Animal is one of the spells that 
have a permanent home in my spell loadout. The problem is that, for the 
life of me, I can't see where it's an improvement on Terrorize animal... 
It costs more mana, and lasts one tick less, so, am I right to assume 
that this spell will have a lesser chance of being resisted than 
Terrorize Animal, by a mob of the same level?
