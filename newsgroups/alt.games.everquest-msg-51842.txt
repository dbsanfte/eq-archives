Not sure if you're just trying to get my goat here, or if you are serious. I
am hoping that you are just trying to be funny, but the lack of any type of
"just kidding" sign makes me think you truly belive this. If this is the
case, this will also be my last response to you, as it would be clearly
obvious that you believe yourself to be all-knowing and incapable of being
ever being wrong. And trying to have a discussion of differing opinions,
regardless of how civil, with someone who is never wrong, isn't worth the
time.

So, to put my point forth again, regardless of how much you agree with
someone else's "opinion", it still does not make that opinion right or
factual. It just means that the two of you are in agreement. If you want to
sit around the fire, or post back and forth in newsgroups, and congratulate
each other on being right because you agree, go nuts. It still doesn't make
you right.
