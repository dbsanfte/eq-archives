Precisely.

Why?  The banker still has its unique value in that you can store stuff with
her/him, including money.  You could make the requirement that you've got to
first sell to or buy from the merchant before being allowed to do a coin
exchange.  Like how some convenience stores require you to buy something
before they'll make change.  But that would add simply another layer of
programming whereas simply giving merchants the coin exchange abilities of
bankers doesn't.
