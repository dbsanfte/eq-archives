No, Paladins and SKs defensive skills are below those of a warriors (though
I think they should be on par - we are called defensive classes after all).
However, there maybe one small thing also that may be allowing the Paladin
to avoid getting hit as much, though generally this is not so noticable,
especially at higher levels.  And that is his AGI.  The higher AGI you have
the better you are at 'dodging' (not the skill dodge - but when a monster
misses you).  Of course, this isn't that great as I said, and I would
probably also agree with Tukka's explanation of what he thinks is happening.
