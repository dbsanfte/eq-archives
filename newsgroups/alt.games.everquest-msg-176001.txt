If you're twinking a Shaman why bother with the newbie quests?  For
one thing not all races even have newbie armor quests.  Get a decent
weapon and some armor, look for Affliction Efficiency, Affliction
Haste, and Affliction Extension focus items, buy yourself a KEI and
an Aego (tip the Cleric nicely, it costs him a lot more to group
Aego you than it costs the chanter for KEI), and go to town.  Use
spells to poull, and cast them as you fight (if your cast gets
interrupted it does not reset your melee timer, so you either get
a spell of or get a swing in, for skills practice).  Once you're
L5 you have a slow (Drowsy) which will make it easier to cast in
combat.  By the time your buffs run out you should be able to gain
quite a few levels and have significant levels in your skills.  THen,
rinse-repeat.
