Nah, just a faulty memory on my part...  LOL  It wasn't the studded variety... 
It was the reinforced which are considerable lower priced...  hehe  But
STILL...  LOL

Trying to sell Sleeves of the Adept for 3k atm as well as Stormreaper Boned
Legs for 5k and no takers...  I can't figure out this bazaar pricing thing as
it is.  I do /ooc PC on <link item> and never get a response so I use my best
guess when there are not identical items for sale.  

Dunno what happened with those Acrylia legs...  LOL  I blame lag.  I must have
been pricing bread crumbs (I thought) and the cursor never left the legs even
though I had clicked on the bread crumbs.  Yeah, that's it....  hehe  

:)
