I only started playing EQ because there was a group on his sub that
played, so he bought the game, and loaded it onto my computer [his
couldnt handle it at the time] and asked me to make sure that it worked
right, and to start a character on sol ro to tell his friends he was in
game. So i logged in, on dial up and went to bed as it took like 8 hours
to patch. We got up, he went to work, and i rolled up a little female
cleric. I played for about 2 hours in the freeport newbie zone, killing
things, looting and selling, and learning the interface. Got killed a
few dozen times, accidentally zoned into commons...had a blast. The boat
got orders to go underway a month earlier than they were supposed to, so
he enver got a chance to play. He came back, 2 weeks later and i was at
level 12. I get a tell from someone, one of his friends and promptly get
dumped down the pit in runneyeye and made dead. I get laughed at, he and
his friends show up, call my body up and invite me to join a guild. My
husband decides to upgrade his computer, get his own copy of the game,
and start his own account.

I sat with him for a few hours, walking him through different functions,
and gave him IIRC 100 plat to get stuff with. He has benefitted with me
giving him assorted stuff, black pantherskin from working on
tradeskills, drops i got that he can use, but nothing to untoward.
Probably the most uber gear he has is the black panterskin i made for
him. I can sit around playing my own game, and look onto his screen and
give him directions on getting through zones, and one time i escorted
him through a couple of zones to meet someone. He just likes doing his
own thing=)

I think between regular play and tradeskills, i have about 84 days
playing aru, and time spent on other alts of another 80 days 
combined...he has all of 15 days playing and tradeskills and only the 
one monk. We have very different play styles, he likes to dip in for 3 
hours at a time, then log and do something else...he thinks LDoN is 
great. Probably even when he gets to my level we will not group
together a lot.
