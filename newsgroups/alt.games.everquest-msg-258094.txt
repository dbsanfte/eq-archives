It's just not worth it.

Just one mistake with them, and it's enough to wipe the entire raid.   One
person not paying enough attention or, even if they are at the keys and
watching, one unfortunate combination of circumstances is enough to cost all
30 people a death, rebuffing time, possible corpse recovery time and
possibly losing hours of trash mob killing to get to that point.

With the exception of charmed pets... there is no pet that does enough
damage to justify that kind of risk.
