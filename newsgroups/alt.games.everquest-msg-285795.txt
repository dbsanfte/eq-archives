	Well, ya know, it's as much a class limitation as a poorly-designed
quest limitation.  A 43 mage could probably un-heroicize those goblins
in short order, for instance...

	The problem is IMHO that every quest is some variation on "kill
200 mobs and loot 10 rare drops".  Quests should be class specific.  A
quest given to a rogue should be "Sneak into the Orc Princess' boudoir and
steal her panties.  Return them to me for your ahhh reward".  Not "Kill
100 Vicious Orc Elfslayers and return to me 10 Left Thumbs.  And a moldy
orc head."
