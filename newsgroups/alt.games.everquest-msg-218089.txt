snappy comeback.

Pros of the chadish punch out system:
Easy to use (they gave them to a class of first graders, asked them to vote
for their favorite cartoon characters, then asked them afterwards who they
voted for. I think one punched out all the holes, everything else was
right).
Can be counted automatically but does not need expensive equipment to use.
Does not depend on people drawing within the lines (Our county uses a 'fill
in the bubble with a number 2 pencil' system, the machine throws out about
30% and they have to count them manually when people just check, mark
through, X, use a red pen, whatever)
It leaves a 'paper trail', unlike electronic or cog count (lever) systems.
(Big machine, you flip the switches for your choice, pull a lever, and it
increments internal counts for each candidate you vote for. Went out of
style years and years ago cause it's too easy to tamper without proof, and
too difficult to maintain).

Cons:
Apparently, some people can't figure out what arrows mean.
Handling, especially rough handling, can quickly cause other chad to pop
corners on 'pre punched' cards (which is why you should use non pre punched
cards. If it has multiple holes then, someone has deliberately tampered with
it).
If it jams going through the counting machine, that vote card is usually non
countable (it gets spindled and mutilated and pops additional chad out).
Recounts are nearly impossible to do with any accuracy on prepunched cards,
due to chad coming out.
The records are subject to damage making them uncountable from water or fire
(not that many things are not, I'm just saying that's the way it is. Plus
pre punched cards are generally more fragile).

Ideal 'current' voting system (imho):
Electronic, self contained, using dual CD-R's. Software should be open
source, verified by MD5 checksum of all program segments, which will be
written on the CD-R's when the system starts up. Vote cast by using stylus
on stylus sensitive screen (do away with the assholes that will say 'I
leaned my elbow on it and it took my vote down wrong' next election), with a
review of the vote, and a 10 second delay on popping up the 'ok continue'
button.

Immediately writes vote to both CD-R's (which are serialized both on the cd
label and by the machine). CD-R's can store approximately 700 mb, which
would easily take one machine's day worth of voting I imagine. CD-R's are
then collected separately, both sets used to create totals. The WORM form of
the CD-R is ideally suited to this purpose (though there are nodoubt other
systems that would be equally capable, including PROM flash cards (not
EPROM), but I think CD-R would be much cheaper, and just as reliable. CD-R's
can also be destroyed after the holding time post election, and I seem to
remember someone that's recycling cd-r's for some nefarious purpose or other
(insulation maybe). As they are not networked they are reasonably tamper
proof without direct access. Add a keyboard to the setup and you can do
write in votes.

Oh yeah, you use a dumb terminal type interface into the serial port, rather
than a direct connection to the computer hardware. Makes it more difficult
to screw up from the keyboard.
