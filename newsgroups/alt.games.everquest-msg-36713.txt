Note carefully what was suggested -- it wasn't just agreeing
to a price up front, it was remaining anon (so that people 
couldn't see you're a cleric) and not even *responding* at all 
to people who didn't wave a *specific* amount of cash in 
their "need a cleric" shout.

The right thing to do is respond, "I"m a cleric, what do you need?"
(if you're not tied up with something else, of course), and
then determine what the person needs, where, under what
conditions, and what they're willing to offer to make it worth
your while.

If what they offer isn't enough to make up for your time and
effort, then sure, turn them down.

But that's different from the advice that had been offered,
which was to not even respond, much less negotiate, with
anyone who announced that they needed a rez without naming
a price figure in their "need a rez" call.  That's just
being a twit.

So agree on a price before you go help.  But that's different
from not even responding to anyone's "help" call unless they 
wave money.
