I think it's level aggro. I know this is purely anecdotal, and I can't
support it with hard facts at all, but from my observations level is a
huge factor in PoF aggro. Our current break group has a 59 shammy as its
lowest level member. Besides him are 60 Warlor, Druid, and Assasin, 63
cleric and 64 chanter. They tend to get seven to nine mobs on the break
and the chanter generally has no trouble with that number.

When we first started doing fear we'd rush two or three groups in that
included people right down to the low fifties. When we did that, it sure
seemed like we got the entire southern half of the zone on our asses
instantly.

Now we hold back the lower members in groups two and (if used) three,
and only send them in after the zone in area is clear and they run to
the west wall and start working from there. Seems to work best. But we
still have to bring the lower level folks, because we r teh suck, etc.
etc. and the drops from even the trash mobs in PoF are often significant
upgrades for many of our members. Hell, I'm still wearing a Carmine
Turban, and if I got the robe I'd wear that too.
