All 950 were not women and children.  There were women and children in those
numbers.  Locust suggested that the mere fact that they were women and
children made it wrong, as if they were never used as combatants.  This is
plainly wrong, they -are- used for terrorist purposes.

Do you know the number of women and children killed?  We just have a gross
number, 950 palestinians.

Again 950 =/= the number of women and children.  You can't say "*all* these
women and children" without knowing how many _were_ killed.  The numbers may
well play out to be a believeable amount.

That's justification for knowing that they're used as impliments of
terrorism.  Can you dispute the fact?
