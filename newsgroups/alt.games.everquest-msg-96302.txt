Necro buff isn't it?  Maybe what you're experiencing are most likely Necros
with their inner Druid trying to get out.  I mean, as a druid, DMF is
utterly unimpressive to me.  PoTG and C2/3 OTOH are nice buffs - won't find
me clicking those off. ;)  Plus, I think my SoE is alot like DMF anyway.

Maybe I'm missing something too.
