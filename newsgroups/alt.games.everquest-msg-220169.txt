Well, first... mobs of a certain level obviously are not of the same
difficulty.  I don't think anyone will argue that level 58 hobgobins in
Plane of Nightmare that hit for 500 are the same difficulty as level 58
Juggs in Sebilis, which hit for 240.   Why should they be worth the same
experience?  And if they were, who would ever kill the goblins instead?

Then it's an issue of convenience.  If you got the same amount of experience
from hunting in Fungus Grove as you did from Charsis, who would ever put in
all the effort to do the Charsis key quest, and all the risks of hunting
there, one way doors and such?   Just go to Fungus and start killing
instead.  Why run 6 zones from the nearest PoK book to get to Chardok or
Sebilis or Dragon Necropolis when  X zone has the same level mobs and is
much closer?

If ZEM was removed, you would still have everybody super crowded into 10% of
the game area... it would just be a different 10%.   Instead of the part
that gives the highest experience reward, it would be the part that is most
convenient and has the easiest mobs of a given level.
