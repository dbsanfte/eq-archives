Well, he is described in one source as a "right jolly old elf" so the only

question remaining would be, High, Wood, Half, or Dark?  I think we
can eliminate DE right off, as surely someone would have commented
on his jet black skin.  Wood Elves cannot be pure casters, and I can't
at the moment think of a red robe thats druid wearable, while rangers
and rogues don't wear robes at all.  High Elf is a possibility,
particularly
as I strongly suspect the old geezer of being a wizard, in order to be
able to port around Norrath that quickly, more than some levitating
Reindeer are going to be required (besides, noone ever mentioned him
waiting for a boat) but I propose that he's half elf instead; HE vision
isn't as good as HIE, and he is seen to require a light source in the
form of a no-drop nose on his groupmate Rudolph in order to penetrate
the fog in some zones (might be a clip plane issue though, perhaps
Rudolph has a better connection or didn't install SOL, and the rest of
the group just autofollow him)

Hmm, I'm guessing its a form of clickable high level mage summon,
you know, like the one with spin the bottle and fireworks.
