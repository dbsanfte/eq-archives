I don't think you even need the cd keys. Just the cc number and the
original registration email address.

Players seizing their accounts back after selling them is fairly
common, and Sony *doesn't* care, because buying it was not allowed
under acceptable use in the first place.

They may ban an account they think is compromised (though I think they
care less about that now than they did), and they will give account
info to the original owner, but they will never knowingly help someone
who bought one and had it hacked or stolen back.
