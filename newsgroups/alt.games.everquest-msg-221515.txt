    I don't recall implying that it's difficult... or even an ubah
achievment. I just said it gives me a buzz. Both kinds of invis are on
random timers and you never know when one is going to drop on you and create

    Not as dangerous as it used to be in my late 50's when I barely knew the
way, but it's still cool. Is that alright with you?
