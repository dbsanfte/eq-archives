Wow. Not sure what to think of it yet. Too much, maybe? Kerafyrm fell 
without it as it stands. However, I do firmly believe there will be 
additional uber encounters ahead in EQ, for that matter.

I just hope they can pull this off without it playing like the Gopher Smash 
game. It sounds very interesting.
