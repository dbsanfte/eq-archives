    Looks like a ton of minor stuff got fixed. Good patch, if it doesn't
require a repatch.

> - Removed the chance to fail on the two combines for the Pureblood quest.

    One of my guild's clerics had already failed this once, then she raised
her Brewing from zero to do it again. She'll be thrilled to know that it's
been fixed for everyone else now. ;-)

    Oooh.

    Aaah. Useful SHM spells, who knew!

> - Added required level to many Legacy of Ykesha items.

    Heh, I hope this is a typo. In the Dev's Corner, it was stated that
RECOMMENDED levels would be added to LoY items. If it's required levels,
their value just dropped big-time.

    I'd heard he was dropping two hearts. Too bad, I plan to get this over
with next weekend and it would have been nice to help out another cleric.

    Why do I get the feeling there's a /petition in my near future
concerning an epic mob that didn't pop?

    Bah, half the fun of the gnome maze event is yelling at morons to "STAY
BEHIND THE GNOME"!

    Very odd. I was just through there last weekend, and undead were up
along the path from Rivervale to High Pass. Anyone know anything more about
this issue?

> - The Goblins in Solusek's Eye are no longer wearing cloth armor.

    I wonder what they drop now. Ringmail? Small Bronze? Could be a real
cash haul if they've been upgraded to something like that.

    Heh, I bet they messed this up when they set the Froglok illusion to
global KOS. Would have been fun in the crypt in Sebilis - the PH for that
cube that drops the paladin hat would have been killed over and over until
the named cube was up. Free hat for every group that camps the crypt!

> - Niola Impholder now teaches Brewing, Begging and Alcohol Tolerance.

    Is this the rogue trainer in Firiona Vie? She also doesn't train Make
Poison.

> - Plaguebone Thieves no longer flee.

    Drat, my necromancer was having great fun with them. I hope no other
changes were made to them!

    Hmm, that sounds like it could be trouble. How quickly will the NPC that
hands out the keys despawn? Currently, guilds will run him out of keys by
chain-hailing him on purpose, so nobody else can run in and get a key they
didn't earn.

    And some of the mystery of EQ disappears. "What secret door do you
suppose opens when the box is clicked?" "None - it was a bug."

    So that hillside near Chardok won't be crawling with Sarnaks anymore?
Hmm, I wonder where they were supposed  to wander.

    And PoK is buggy in so many ways. I've noticed that people's horses are
getting left behind when they zone. But that's not the really goofy part. On
the French server, apparently if pet owners zone out without getting rid of
the pet first random NPCs are replaced by the pet. They haven't been able to
pass Tier 3 PoP planes because the quest NPC they need to talk to is now a
mage pet named Jonartik.

    Yay, no more people trapped in Great Divide by the ring war!
