Lore is lore whether it's on your person or in the bank. The answer is,
no... you can't do it. You'll need to sell/destroy/otherwise get rid of
the first one before you can loot another. This will become VERY
important later on if you try some of the much harder quests that result
in Lore rewards. Keep it in mind.
