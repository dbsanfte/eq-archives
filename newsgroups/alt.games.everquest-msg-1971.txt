I'm ready.

Potentially there is a possibility for everyone who wants an item to
obtain one. So?

Nobody mentioned all items being nodrop/lore as this single step would
kill economy out right.
What you don't understand is that twinking does not make items 'less' or
players 'more' therefore twinking as such does not address the balance.
If anything it _keeps_ the items in the game that may have been
otherwise destroyed by players who were too high levels to use them
themselves.

Oh, corpses don't vanish _ever_ as well?

Oh, you just don't understand what twinking is. Lemme explain - it is
handing down an item inappropriate for the recipient because of their
level. It is giving them an item they would have not been able to obtain
as yet.

It all depends on the sword and levels of your alt and that stranger.

Why? Is it worth _much_ more? If it is then it's twinking (why bother
taking any plat for it at all?)

It isn't twinking since food isn't inappropriate at any level.

Huh? I get, say, lvl40 weapon as loot. Are you telling me I am
encouraged it to take it all the way to newbie area to hand it to some
lvl10? Or my alt?

And to back it up you are offering what exactly? Your feelings?
BTW I'm curious - which of the words you used do you consider 'large'
then?
And were did you put so much effort into using them that it all made you
forgot what you were going to address (how would economy not exist
without twinks)?
