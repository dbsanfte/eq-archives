"Only"? I don't think so. They have about $50 billion on hand. They
could buy their own consulting company and acquire 50,000 new hands-on
salesmen to put in Server 2003 and SQL Server. They're serious about
entertainment, not just X-Box. There's a lot of room left in cell
phone techs, PDAs, e-money, publishing, music, etc. Gates is still
dreaming of the "electronic wallet". You're too doctrinaire in your
segment thinking. It's not 1990.

The desktop is evolutionary, not revolutionary any more.

They make the corporate-standard laptops. By far the favored models of
road-warriors who can afford them. Desktops are a commodity business
and have been since the days of Leading Edge and Eagle. Commodity
isn't IBM's strong suit.

They make lots of money in notebooks. Why stop?

Not at all like that.

 The PC didn't

No, it took over by doing what typewriters and accounting pads could
do. Mainframes kept chugging away doing what they do. There are still
lots of mainframes around BTW.

Makers

Not even close. I don't know how old you are, but the facts show that
the original IBM PC was targeted at business and bought by business,
and that's when minicomputers took off. Apple and Radio Shack were
hobbyist toys. When IBM signaled that the time was now corporations
took notice. Not before. The $3000 price (an excellent used car that
year) had something to do with it. Those prices held for a few years,
but the cost curves came down fast and lots of cloners were in the
market by about 1987. I bought my first 286 Intel machine that year
from a mail-order company called PC's Limited, a start-up run by a guy
named Dell. There was no way a poor grad student could have afforded a
"real" IBM AT.

 I'd tend to agree that the emphasis now is on pleasing
>corporate customers. That's a mistake. A mistake that's been made
>before.

Well, they have money and are far easier to forecast than household
consumers. It was that way in 1986 too. One meeting with the CIO and
you know how big the order will be. Call the factory.

Baloney.

 And of all industries, the computer industry should know
>best that you either change or you die. 

I see constant change. In fact, I ordered a new notebook today. Far
more capability than a Cray supercomputer of 1986. Far more capability
than my  2-YO desktop.

The improvements are so minor
>and so few and far between in the PC industry now that it really
>*does* remind me of the Big Iron days of the 1970s.

All new industries follow this model to some extent. A lot of the
early "innovation" was shaking out things that didn't work. There were
something like 1000 car manufacturers in the world in 1920 as well. IF
something comes along that is so radically better for most consumers
as the difference between a mainframe programmed with cards and a PC
with Lotus 123 I expect you'll see a huge, lurching shift. What will
bring it? I think a new task set that isn't currently being served.
I've done audit working papers on accounting pads. The advantages of
spreadsheets over stubby pencil was so massive there was no question
the PC was going to win. Show me that kind of gap in any task set and
I'll agree that there's a chasm coming. Until then we're doing fine.

 I hope the PC

Why do you see doom and gloom? Cost per instruction and cost per MB of
storage are laughably low. What tasks can't you do that you want to
do? (Self-programming computers would be nice, but that's not the
hardware's fault.)
