When were these incidents? I ported into Skyfire to give a ride to a
monk in our guild (BIG mistake) when she was FD'd at the wizzy port in
point. She popped up as I arrived and a firefight ensued. AoE's were
flying and my familiar got toasted. I went down shortly after. Got a rez
just fine after dragging to the BW zone. Was also able to recast a new
pet with no worries. Maybe I was just lucky.
