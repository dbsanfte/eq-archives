I call what I do root kiting.  Thats DD+ root +DD (repeat until root breaks)
+ root + DD (repeat until root breaks)  + root... Cleric DOTs are
usable only against undead, and root breaks on DD more often than
not, so this involves a lot of running with a mob chasing me.

Root + DOT +DOT +DOT and med unless root happens to break,
thats root rotting.  Introduce DD into the equation and you will
certainly be re-rooting a lot, and doing some moving in order to
get out of melee range.  WIth the new DOT rules, though, its quite
possible that Root +DOT +DOT + DOT + begin DD/Root cycle
is a faster way to kill things

If he rarely has to re-cast root, sure, but if his plan is to break root
frequently then I say its still kiting.  Kiting = mob chasing you, Rotting
= mob standing still.  I'll grant you its a grey area though....
