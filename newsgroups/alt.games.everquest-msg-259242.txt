I was just thinking about this a bit earlier, and it occurs to me that 
the effectiveness of the two as a function of level are on opposing slopes;

HP regen starts out very effective, and becomes gradually less so, as 
mobs hit harder faster than you can get more HP regen.

Mana regen starts out reasonably effective, but becomes gradually more 
so, as the mana efficiency of your spells get larger as you level up; 
even Cheal (as your tanks get bigger, plus AA add to the effect of the 
heal if your tanks are large enough, or charmed mobs)

Also, at very low levels, HP regen means you can take on harder and 
harder mobs till you find ones that are hitting harder than you regen. 
Mana regen doesn't mean as much, as there's a maximum amount of mana 
expenditure per minute you can manage.

At higher levels, HP regen still works the same way, only its only 
effective on some of the easiest mobs you go up against; for anything 
difficult, you need a healer, at which point HP regen probably isn't 
worth the AC you sacrifice to don it.

At higher levels, though, mana regen -does- increase the amount of time 
you can spend consecutively nuking or healing, and the amount of time 
per minute you can do so, even on the hardest mobs.

It isn't as black and white as I describe it above, but I think in 
general terms there's something to the notion.
