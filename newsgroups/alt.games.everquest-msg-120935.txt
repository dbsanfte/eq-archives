Excellent info!! Just the thing I was looking for. My partner (a 14 SK) and
myself ( 14 Necro) want to explore some of the world(s).  I've been playing
since the beginning but never played an 'evil' character before so I was
looking for some pointers on travel and buying/selling.  We love playing
these characters and want to continue doing so.  And yes, we do look cool.
:-D  Thanks for the help. Any other info, greatly appreciated.
