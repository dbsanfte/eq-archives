I am not sure I understand the RP thing so well myself... (I HATED D&D...too
slow for my tastes) so maybe I am misunderstanding the objectives here. I
just noticed a lot of the same 'terminology here as in D&D. I think she will
like this, simply for the fantasy aspect, even if there isn't a lot of
RP'ing going on.

We shall have to wait and see...
:)
Thanks for the information!
