Let me play devils advocate then Lokari hehe.  When was the last time
Creative updated drivers for their card.  It's been ages since we have
seen an update, and until very recently i don't think there was a
"certified" driver, and it was just for the 5.1 cards, not for the live
value etc...  No DX 8 drivers for the Creative card either.  The overall
lack of support by Creative has definitely got me questioning whether or
not I will buy one of their products in the future.
