Well, no more than you have shown any evidence that you know what you're
talking about.

My druid has a pathetic 60+ days /played (any time someone plays a character
that long it's pathetic...I mean, come on, get a life, will ya?  And it
might be as bad as 90, but I can't remember), the vast majority in groups.

It's been my experience that the average 50+ ranger can't even remember to
manage aggro, let alone cast a spell when required.  This new spell doesn't
help in the slightest.  And that's why rangers are called mana sinks, and
druids are not.
