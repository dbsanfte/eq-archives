Isnt that really what draws us into the SW universe? Its distant but
familiar ties to our own existance? Thats how we identitfy with it so
well. We all can feel for Luke's initial desires and how he feels
"stuck" when we first see him in ep4. How the characters face
challenges similar to our own in life. Its how real the characters
were superimposed on a sci-fi backdrop that made the first movie a
success (as opposed to the cardboard characters of the new movies).

Probably not. The recent crop of movies is proof as well. Doesnt mean
its going to suck tho.

Im not sure EVERYONE will want to be one - but you bring up an
excellent point of balance, something all mmorgs struggle with during
thier entire existance.

Im not so much worried about this aspect at launch or early on. My
fear is years down the road when there is an established base of Jedis
and becoming one has been... institutionalized much like epic quests
are in EQ now. I believe I read somewhere that to become a master -
you have to seek out a master and become a padawin (sp??). In the
movies, obviously a master can only have one student. Will it be
possible in the game to PL-up a bunch of buddies to Jedi-hood?

If there are other ways of being "uber" in this game (as there SHOULD
be), then this may not be a problem. I think most jedi-wanna bes will
find out fast how hard the road is and give up and do something else.

Exactly my fear. As stated above, it WILL be figured out. If theres a
quick and easy path, it will be discovered quickly and the masses will
jump on it. Unfortunately, many want the ultimate rewards for little
work. They cant see the pleasure of actually EARNING something with
hard work.
