Yeah, Not having a link to where-ever these logs are,  and asking for
him do demonstrate(preferably by using the logs) the context of these
statements.  He suggests that I read the Logs.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
