(token comment about the prior topic)

I hadn't thought of it that way, but it's definitely true for me.  I'm
figuring out all my quests based just on the information given in game, where
as before I felt that I had to go to Allakazams or a similar place, to save
keyboard wear (from banging it with my head, after the 50'th attempt to find
the correct trigger phrase, which would be along the lines of "Yes I will aid
you, magnificent dragon of Silver with just a hint of green around the claws"

I did want to ask you if you've seen anyone fighting using a staff yet, since
I knew you were into that for your EQ character : )

In just running around doing random quests, I happened to recieve an Oakmyst
Staff.   It was better stats than what I was using, so I figured what the
hell, I could put up with it until I got something better.

Then I saw him use it.   A wood elf using a quarterstaff... and it just looks
*so* awesome.   It's nothing like EQ1, where all 2 hand blunt weapons have the
same swing, just kind of bash down and repeat.     He wields it like someone
would use a quarterstaff, spinning it about to strike out with both ends,
flipping it behind his back to do a spinning strike .   When he uses the kick
skill with it, instead of just doing a kick, he actually plants the
quarterstaff and then uses it to launch himself in a jump kick kind of attack.

I really didn't think I would like the weapon, but at this point I'm seriously
considering skipping the next few upgrades so I can use it longer, and seeking
out more staff weapons.   It looks that great.

If you havne't done this quest yet on your High Elf fighter, do so
immediately!   They may not be the exact same animations, but if they're even
half as good you'll love it.  (I think it was "Proof of the poachers" quest in
Oakmyst)
