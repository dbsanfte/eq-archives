I don't remember the rest of your questions.. er the answers to those 
questions.

I got a key board for our PS2 for EQOA, and I did do some chatting- but 
it was obvious when some poor sod didn't have a keyboard. They'd hail 
you, and then sit there for what fel like an hour before coming out with 
a new statement. There were shouts, auctions, and chatting with group 
members. Tells were an option too- but I never did that. I think there 
was a way to leave mail for characters too- but I never figured that out.

Only group I was in was completely pick up. Groups are limited to four 
people too.I don't know anyone in real life who plays EQOA... but I know 
several fellow real EQ players.

There's a place that keeps track of what so-and-so has said to you and 
what quest you are currently working on.. but it's not reliable, so I 
ended up taking notes anyway. I do second Bebinn's enthusiasm for the 
quests- that was one of the better parts.
