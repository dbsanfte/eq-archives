Umm, you became a citizen, so you've found at least one quest.  It's likely
there are more that you can do.  Just talk to a bunch of npcs, and do things
they say if it sounds fun.

Along the way, you'll likely meet other people, sometimes group with them, and
probably kill some stuff.  Repeat as long as you're enjoying yourself, then
stop.
