But, secondary stats can affect the liklihood of getting a skill increase,
this has also been confirmed by Verant.  I believe that Dex does this for
fletching in particular.  Your chance of a skill increase is increased by
having a high primary stat (higher of INT/WIS), and a high secondary stat,
DEX.
