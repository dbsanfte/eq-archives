There were around 120 people on during the first evening in AkAnon, and 
180 in Steamfont.  Meanwhile, in LFay there were 11 (people zoning out 
from something scary in either GFay or Steamfont, and people 
travelling), and in GFay there were a whopping 476.

Not only is GFay the newbie zone for the wood elves, but its also their 
city zone, and its the newbie zone for high elves on top of that.  Three 
  populations in a single zone.

By tonight, though, and during the day, it was a different story; about 
half as many people, and more spread out; people had leveled 
sufficiently that they weren't all competing for the same level one or 
two mobs.  Its still a very odd place, especially for any of us who've 
played a fresh toon in the past couple years where most zones are empty 
and even those with players in them have, most likely, a group or two 
worth.
