be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 7
hours.

For those too lazy to go there. Everyone please take note, this is
posted A WEEK AND A HALF in advance. Someone get a freaking google
link to this post for proof when someone comes in here pissing and
moaning about the patch not being announced until an hour before they
bring the servers down...
