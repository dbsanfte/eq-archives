I've long been a Sony supporter in matters of customer service and
value. However, when purchasing PoP recently, it occurred to me that a
new subscriber who wants to experience all the features EQ has to
offer (and who wouldn't) is facing an expense of about $90 (Trilogy,
SoL and PoP) plus the monthly fee just to get started.

I find that pretty ridiculous and can't imagine anyone willing to bite
that kind of bullet to get into EQ.
