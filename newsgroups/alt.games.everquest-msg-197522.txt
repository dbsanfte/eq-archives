The wait time has gone down considerably, at least on EMarr.  Longest line 
I have seen while doing the trials was about 4 groups, and most fail, so no 
30 minute wait.

It still ends up being a lot of time to get a handful of people flagged, at 
best.

Usually the successful flagging group consists of one, or two unflagged 
people.  In my particular case, it was 2 unflagged, but, only becuase the 
other unflagged person was a 61 rogue, so could add good DPS.

While I won't say that flagging was the entire cause of a number of our 
high level, flagged people, leaving the guild, it was the final straw.
