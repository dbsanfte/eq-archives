Just out of curiosity, what are some of the absolute worst names you
have ever seen on a PC?  Here are some of the worst I have witnessed
on the Brell server:

Verizon Wireless
Poopin Nuggets
Dyldo
Chronic
Kehrmit
Biill
Budweiser (well, that one was spelled differently but was phonetically
the same)

I know it's difficult to pick a character name that is either creative
or in the spirit of roleplaying but c'mon.  I think the worst was
Verizon Wireless.
