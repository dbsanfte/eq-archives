Fat lot of good that did me. *harrumph*.

You could have at least told me how we could beat RoF with a fairly
minimal force. (Four groups I think?) The boss mob takes an insane
amount of time to put down. Some combination of god awful high HP and AC
and some insane regen we suspect. Problem is, while you are fighting him
for what seems like forever, as long as you have a trigger guy standing
in the circle, more and more of the other mobs keep spawning. Eventually
they just overwhelmed the chanters and tank mezzers. But if your trigger
guy steps out of the ring to stop the adds from spawning, the boss poofs
on you, even if he's at fucking 10% health.

grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
