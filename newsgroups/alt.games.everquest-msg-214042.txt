While I have seen such things done for trade skill items, I don't think you are
likely to get it working for a rare drop spell; if you have access to two or
three copies of a spell, why not just mem one of them, which would be free,
rather than go to all the trouble of dragging down the price from that one
trader?

The reason this works for trade skill items is that you are trying to manipulate
the market for something you are going to need stacks and stacks of, so playing
games with a stack or two to bring down prices on all the vendors in the market
can pay off, then you use both your own stack and those of your victims, so no
waste.  Danger is that someone might buy your stack at your artificially low
price instead of lowering their price to match yours, "cornering the market" as
it were.

Further, if he's like me, he probably put the item out there at his price and
won't bother looking at the going rates again for weeks.  Meantime you've been
without the spell and without the cash you could have gotten for selling the
other copy at just a bit under his price.
