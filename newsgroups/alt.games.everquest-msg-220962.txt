This new demon god could be younger but more powerful and less 
beaurocratic than the existing gods.  He is huge, brash, and 
uncontrolled when compared to the elder gods who have lived for millions 
of years.  His demons are just like him; huge, powerful, and uncontrolled.

The city of the dark elves feed off of this power.  They have practiced 
the darkest of magics, building in strength.  We already have mortals 
that are more powerful than immortal gods, these are just like those.

Now why a big bat in the Lost Dungeons is harder than Naggy was, that I 
cannot explain.

Mike
