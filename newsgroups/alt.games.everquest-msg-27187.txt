It's not an irreversible hit,  but it's a huge one.  Just killing the live
lucan took one of my char's from ally to apprehensive and had I also killed
his dead version, I would have gone KoS.  I know a lot of Paladins who have
reversed the faction after doing their soulfire, although it wasn't fun
killing orcs and gnolls in High Pass.  But I think your only solution here
is to rid the world of Orc Pawns.
