That's different... BRT, OMW, WB and all that are acronyms used to speed 
communication. Not a problem whatsoever with that, but "plz" is an 
entirely different beast altogether... When you say "please", you are 
trying to be courteous and polite. If you take a shortcut there, you are 
entirely defeating the purpose. What you are telling the other person is, 
basically "I want SoW as fast as possible".

Well, "sow plz" definitely gets a point across, only probably not the one 
the buff beggar intends.
