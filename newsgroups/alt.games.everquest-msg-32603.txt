FLAME!! FLAME!! FLAME!! FLAME!!

Okey, with that out of the way, welcome to the group... I may agree or
disagree with your initial impressions, but they are yours and entirely
respectable. I'll tell you a bit of how things seem to work here,
though. Some people here are a bit more itchy-fingered with the flame
cannon than others, certainly, and some people have particular pet hates
that can't refrain themselves from posting on (like me and the name
threads... sigh), but most of the regular posters are people who have
been playing the game for a long time, and always have at least
reasonably informed insights and points of view. So even when we flame
the hell out of each other, we also respect each other.

On the other hand, when someone's first appearance in the newsgroup
consists of half-baked insults, bullshit and general cluelessness,
compounded with attempts to bypass killfiles and top-posting, he can
expect to be roasted to a crisp. What got that particular idiot flamed
was not that he held an opposite view (in fact, I got myself flamed once
over that very same subject by a poster for whom I have an enormous
respect. Don't think that we all see eye to eye on all or even most
EQ-related matters here), but the fact that he started off name-calling,
and escalated from there.
