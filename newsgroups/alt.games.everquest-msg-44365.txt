Hmmm, maybe it's because I'm a wood elf, but this method always seems
to work for me:

Swim straight at the hole until I'm up against it, then slowly turn 
left as I keep my other finger firmly pressed on the forward arrow 
key-- so that I'm swiming forward and turning left at the same time.

Definitely use a water breathing spell or device to do this, though,
if you're new to the Hole.
