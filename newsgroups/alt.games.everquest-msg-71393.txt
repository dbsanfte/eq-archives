Been there, done that.  I rooted myself right in front of two Drolvargs
once.  Needless to say, I lasted for a few seconds.  Just recently did it
again, but it was just one Cockatrice, so I killed it, ended the fight very
low on both mana and health, but I did survive.  There seems to be a really
bad problem with targeting at times lately.  I can be grouped, sitting and
watching the MA fighting a mob, hit my assist hotkey, that has been set to
assist the MA, and nothing happens, I hit it repeatedly, nothing, so I hit
F8, and I am now targeting the stupid mob that the MA is busily killing
right in front of me.  Only happened once last night, but I can't explain
what was wrong.  It worked fine both before, and after that incident.
