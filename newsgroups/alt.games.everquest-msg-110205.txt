Once when I killed the chancellor in the sarnak fort to get a part for
the HS key, I mez'd a few snarks and the chancellor's dog while I
killed him.  Strangely enough, the mem-blur component of mez worked on
the pet and it was 'indifferent' to me after it's master died.  

When the snarks broke mez, they both agro'd the pet before going after
me.  


My guess is that pets are created with the same faction as an agnostic
human, so anything that is KOS by default to most will be KOS to pets
after they lose their master's faction.
