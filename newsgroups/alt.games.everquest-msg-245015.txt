Camping may not make much sense, but getting run3 at 51 would take
quite a while and if you luck out and run into the cyclops you can get
your Jboots pretty quickly.  I'm level 62 and still don't have so much
as a single AA (but I've had Jboots since long before 51 and am a
bard so I can run fast as long as it's outdoors anyway).
