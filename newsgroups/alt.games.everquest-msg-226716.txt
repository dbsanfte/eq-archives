Given that FD was not the target of the nerf Im still confused. 
The PoP nerf of Monks was completely to damage mitigation. Seems
certain factions thought that nerfing monks would help them. Turned a
class that was a pleasure to play even with average gear into gimps.
Helped exactly no one it was intended to, including whining Furor
(warrior) who then saw Knights fill in the vacuum left by Monks and
then some. Biggest BS nerf in the history of the game imho.

Agreed but I contend its already crashing. Latest reviews of online
gaming place EQ in the middle of the pack with comments such as "seems
to have lost its way". Cant argue with that.

The number of classes make balance impossible. Consider if there were
only 4 classes. War, Cleric, Wiz and Chanter. Very distinct roles that
dont over lap enough to be any problem. Balance is easy then, now give
each class the ability to be personalized by the player by race or
skills and you get the flavor needed without all the glut of upteen
classes with overlapping roles. 

At least I was able to sell of 3 years of plat last month so I
shouldnt bitch, enjoyed it while it was fun.
