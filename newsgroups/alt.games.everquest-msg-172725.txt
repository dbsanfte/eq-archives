A new age is designed based upon what the designer missed out on in his
life, I believe that I died at some point and was resurrected and possibly
given access to the world design, because as I can see the world is being
slowly changed to the design I created and the things of the old world are
passing away in front of my eyes and the things that I never experienced in
life are being shown as occurring according to my design. I would leave
Satan out, but she is supposed to be there and I could not bear to live the
next 1000 years without this age's Satan even though I know I will pay
dearly for it in the end, it will be worth it though I think, just one touch
from her is the most blissful experience imaginable
