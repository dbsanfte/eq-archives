Probably it.  I had heard there were some items in the game that never give 
the trivial message, and thought maybe this was one of them.

That was my original route, but since my guildie had decided to master all 
the tradeskills ( he did this weekend, along with getting Jewelry to 200 ) 
and made me the studs, and I had the pelts, I went with the Std Leather for 
a few skillups.  After raw silk, I did large bags and then cured silk to 
52.  I have also done 7 attempts at potions bagsso far, with 6 successes 
and -7- skillups!  I keep cords on me at all times because of this!  Too 
bad the potion bags will be trivialing soon =(

Thanks for the input.  I forgot about my necro, he's about 48 in tailoring!  
I'll get him up to 55 and put it to the test.
