I've lost my EQ CD's when I moved, and it would suck much to have to go buy 
em all over again.

Obviously I don't need the keys, just the CD's, so does anyone know where I 
could possibly download the CD's from, or does anyone have an FTP they 
could put it on or something?

Any help would be greatly appreciated....just don't wanna have to buy em 
again :\

Thanks!

P.S. - I know I can download the trilogy software (at least I think you 
still can), but I still need the SoL and PoP ones as well. Thanks!
