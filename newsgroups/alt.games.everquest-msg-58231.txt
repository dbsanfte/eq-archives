Oh sure, relevance would be nice, but turning off all EQ broadcast is pretty
much the same as the default DAOC airwaves.   I dare say that in EQ if you
turned off all zone-wide chat you wouldn't be missing anything relevant.
Relevant comments are that rare in EQ.

I've started to take note of stupid names in DAOC btw...they seem to be as
common as they are in EQ (possibly more common).  Prediction:  Adding an any
area-wide chat channel in DAOC would made DAOC & EQ chat identical (making
allowances for different zone, class, race, & ph4t l3wtz names, of course).
Enjoy the silence and lack of "TRAIN!" calls while you can. :)
