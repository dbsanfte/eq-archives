No, it indicates it was a coincidence since you can still play *using the same
ISP* but a different number.  Also, if it was on Verant's side, more than
"dozens" of others would notice it--tens of thousands would.

I said "probably" your ISP since you said you used two different dialups to
the same ISP.  One worked, the other didn't.  It's entirely possible that
those two dialups are using completely different routes to the EQ servers,
meaning the problem could be somewhere else in between.  Have you run tracert?

Verant is using UDP, streaming data over the internet.  Something like web
browsing uses TCP and is inherently bursty.  So if you have intermittent
problems (frequently due to a congested or faulty router somewhere) the bursty
traffic will appear to be largely uninterrupted.  Web pages will still load
relatively quickly.  But EQ's traffic will be ridden with packet loss.  It's a
much more demanding type of app--not so much on bandwidth, but on quality of
service.

*Sigh* Yes, EQ will fail to be optimal when the "network performance envelope"
is blowing donkeys.  However, the entity responsible for that performance
failure is not Verant, as you have already proven.

But all it comes down to is whether or not the data is getting to the
destination--or not.  That's it.  Yes, the protocol their data is using may be
quite complex, but once the data leaves their facilities it's up to the rest
of the route to make sure the data gets to you intact.  If a firewall is
dropping packets, the firewall is to blame.  If your virus software is
censoring your data, it's your virus software to blame, etc.  If the data
doesn't get there, what on earth can Verant do about it?

Ok, just how do you propose that Verant magically reconstruct data that gets
lost on the way to its servers?  That's all that's happening, and as you (and
the hundreds of thousands that play without problems) have already proven,
it's not Verant's fault.  It might be a legitimate user complaint, but it
still doesn't mean there's anything Verant can do about it.  They can't hunt
down every little Internet performance issue.  If a router in Wakachikiwawa,
Wisconsin goes nutty, it's up to the Wakachikiwawans to fix it.
