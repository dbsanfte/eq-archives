I agree with that, and said I did.   I just don't see him being what the
military
would term a "grunt", which is what I meant by "front line soldier."   His
money
and contacts outside Afghanistan would have been too valuable to risk daily.
IMO, he'd have had to prove his commitment by taking part in some battles,
and probably would have been involved in any critical fighting near his
location.
After he was accepted, though, his time could have been better spent
elsewhere.
