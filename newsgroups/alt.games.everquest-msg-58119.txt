I just use the default forage button =P, I have it kinda ingrained into me
to stand up first.  Same with sense heading, track and the meditate key.  I
did post the recipe for the other ones (/who all GUILD; /who all friends; /g
Ghealing %t, /cast 2; /assist), one note about the /assist key, you can put
/assist %t in there and it will work, but this was a more recent change than
being able to just use /assist with who/what you want to assist targeted.

I have trouble with all but the most basic scripting too, even though I
wrote a killer custom cfg for Counter-strike back in the day  =P, that
/pause command behaves funky.

Well, anyways, for the keys I don't use, not to mention that I rarely even
mem root anymore.
Snare - /g SNARING %t
            /cast 6
Nuke - /g Whomping %t
            /cast 3
Thorns /g DSing %t
            /cast 5
Root -  /g Root Parking %t, Back away!
            /cast 7

no hotkeys for other buffs, I tend to keep SoW up in slot 8, and use slot 1
as a general swap box for skin, strength, camo, ports etc.

I also have hotkeys that I swap in from time to time for /corpse when I need
to drag a corpse around and for instructing what to kill after I harmony
something. (/g Harmonizing %t;  /cast 1)

Also, once you get Ensnare at level 29, throw out that level 1 Snare,
Ensnare is only 35 mana (25 more than Snare)  and lasts a LOT longer
(especially useful for meleeing something to death when its snare-running
away not beating on you and you're OOM, since my druid's 1HB sucks from
using a scimitar for 25 levels, then I got a Velium Etched Stone mace, I
spent like 5 minutes spamming an ulthork to death last week with 1 point
hits)

I also don't have a DoT hotkey because I find myself not casting those in
groups because they don't wear off before the fight ends, and I'm usually
healer anyways, as well to avoid pissing off the enchanter.  I basically
only cast Immolate or Creeping Crud when soloing, although when partnered
with my warrior friend I do cast flame lick (!) for the minor AC debuff
since it's fairly mana free. (BTW, fear kiting Snow Cougars is dead easy
with a druid/warrior partnership, as long as you can find any to kill, hehe)

And I'm sure that you know the procedure for multi-group raid situations,
just replace /g in all these with /gu or /ooc or /shout depending on the
situation or procedure. =D
