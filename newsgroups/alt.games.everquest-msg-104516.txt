Good.  For your first few raids, it should be like that.

I think I died 6 times my first trip to Hate...we never had
one wipeout, but this was before "Evade," also.  I remember
missing a backstab as my only attack on my very first
spite golem, at which he turned around and creamed me.

I don't think I ever ended up with any woven shadow
until level 49, and I know that when I got a Bone Razor
at 48 in Fear, it was a definate upgrade to my dual
Serrated Bone Dirks.  I ended up passing it down
to my alt rogue, and still have it in her bank somewhere.
Some things are just special...
