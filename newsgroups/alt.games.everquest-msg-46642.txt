Ouch, you are kind of spending more than you'd recoup almost.
You probably are not going to sell a set for more than 20 plat these
days.

Really you'd be better off leveling to a point where you can go to EK
on crags or Guk on those first spiders there and just get a huge haul
of silks at once. Then you might be better off making cured silk out
of them since raw is such a cheap return and so low end that its
essentially rank newbie gear and newbies are poor and no one twinking
would buy it.

Oh that reminds me, are people auction shy or what? The other day I
spent like 3 hours auctioning a blackened crystalline robe, 8 ac, 6
int, 5 charisma, looks like FBR but greenish black with blue design
(very nice) make offer in plat or trade. The goofy thing was I got NO
OFFER and its not like I was looking for a ton. The best I got was
some goober offering me his much WORSE robe of the elements and 75
plat and telling me that was a "Good" deal. I explained that then I'd
have 75 plat (pretty negligeable amount) and a WORSE robe to sell so
that really does not help me. Then of course like such persons he says
"Plz?" That always cracks me up.. OH YEAH, SINCE YOU SAID PLZ NOW I
WILL SURE! In disgust I ended up putting it on the POD, he deserves it
more than players do. He looked spiffy too!
