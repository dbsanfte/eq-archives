This is getting way off topic and should move to a different forum entirely.
The man / school / shooting incident had occured in a DIFFERENT COUNTRY, it
wasn't even in the UK.   But that was their "reason" for banning guns. You can
own guns but you cannot keep them in your home.  They MUST be kept at a "gun
club",  (you can go somewhere and VISIT your gun while supervised, if you want
to take the weeks it takes to meet the regulations).
