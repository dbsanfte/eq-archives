Nice.

My druid had some slight religious problems; my warrior had *severe*
religious problems before deciding to go agnostic, so she is quite
philosophical for a warrior; my gnome mage loves everyone and likes
flowers, sunshine etc; and my dark elf, who started out with
stereotype Teir'dal disdain of everyone else, is coming to like
barbarians. The big oafs have a certain charm and aren't pompous
selfrighteous fools like many of the 'intellectual' races. She likes
poking fun at paladins... And, for some reason, she's turning out
'sexier' than my wood elves. Must be 14 levels of leather pants...
