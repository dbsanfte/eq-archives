A Paladin or SK can take agro from a warrior at will generally speaking.  
A few very low mana cost, very high agro spells is far greater agro than 
taunt and the very similar melee damage from a warrior.  There is no 
question that at almost any level a hybrid tank can hold agro far better 
than a warrior.  Probably starts at level 9 when they get spells.  The 
issue is that the hybrids can take the damage almost as well as warriors, 
and that combination is what makes them so much more desirable.
