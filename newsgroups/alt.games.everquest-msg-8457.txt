I know how you feel.  And yes, it is as wonderful as you anticipate.
I bugged Warner Cable every couple of months for three years, asking
them when they were going to start offering cable modem service,
and how I could sign up to be one of their early testers.  It
seemed the day would never arrive, but it finally did, and it
was worth the wait.

Ignore some of the more complex/expensive suggestions that have been
made in this thread.

Here's what you do:

  1.  Buy another ethernet card.  This will run no more than $15 or
      so.

  2.  Install it on the same machine that currently has the modem
      connection that your two computers are sharing via ICS.
      (yes, this means you'll have two ethernet cards in that
      computer -- not a problem, the computer automatically
      figures out what to do with each one).

  3.  Install TCP/IP protocol for the new ethernet card, and
      don't bother fiddling with the default settings.

  4.  Hook your new cable modem to this new ethernet card.

  5.  Bring up the Options screen for your Internet Connection
      Sharing, and flip the setting for "Select the connection
      that you use to access the Internet" from "Dial-up
      Adapter" to <whatever your new ethernet card is listed as>

  6.  Congratulations, you're now sharing the cable modem internet
      connection instead of the modem internet connection, for
      a total investment of $15.

This is the setup I use, and it works just great even with five
computers sharing the internet simultaneously, doing various
internet-y things.  I've even had 3 EQ games running at the
same time, no problem.

Also, if you can spare the cash, it's worthwhile to keep paying
for a dial-up ISP service even after you have cable modem service.
When your cable-modem service goes down for a few hours (ALL
ISP's go down sometimes), it's great to be able to just flip
your ICS settings back to "Use Dial-up adapter" and then you're
right back online again until the cable modem comes back.

This is invaluable in EQ, for getting back to your
group when you're deep in <insert nasty dungeon here>, instead
of coming back hours later when the cable service returns,
only to find yourself alone and surrounded.

With two ISPs and the easy ability to flip/flop between them
via ICS, you'll never be without internet connectivity.

Most likely, yeah.  Don't get too chatty about that.

And yes, your cable modem service will "see" the setup I
describe above as one computer, not several.
