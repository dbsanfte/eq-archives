Agreed with the general idea of the review. I liked it overall, and I
might buy it on down the road. The crafting system was a HUGE plus to
me. I'd love to see EQ adopt parts of the crafting system just for the
ease of creating batches of items. I liked the concept of having to
have your skill at a certain level to even attempt combines, but never
failing (unless you adjust the slider they have on the combine window
for lower resource use but increasing % fail chance) once you're
there. Of course, the idea of being able to progress purely as a
crafter, and being able to go out and gather my resources to make the
items without having to sink money at a vendor appealed to me a lot.

If EQ would adopt only the "batch combine" concept, I'd be thrilled.

The adventuring side of Horizons interested me, but not as much as
crafting. Suppose I'm one of "those weirdos". ;) Technical issues with
the beta were pretty much what I tend to expect from a beta, even at
late stages.

The launch will be rough, I'm almost certain of that. But those who
have said it would make SWG's launch look smooth are exaggerating, I
believe. I don't think it's going to "kill" any games currently out
there, but it'll have its niche. It'll survive, but it's not going to
be a blockbuster.

Overall, it's not *great*, but it is good. I believe it'll have an
advantage in the CS department over some of the other games out there
in that they've got a more..."warm" staff.
