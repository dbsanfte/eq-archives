I'm having a problem for about a month now. The casting bar disappears often
when I play a song. No, it's *NOT* a missed note...I get no message saying
so, and the icon pops up in the song box when it's supposed to, indicating
the song *is* indeed being played correctly. It's just the casting bar is
AWOL for some reason.
This doesn't happen when I solo, just when grouping and the swords and
spells are a-flying. I'm assuming this is a graphics glitch then, but it's
only been since a few patches ago, maybe a month ago.

All my hardware is supported (according to this sites listed supported
hardware), using dual-booted 98/2k pro (happens in both OSes), DX8.1 and
latest Nvidia graphics drivers. Dxdiag shows no problems.

Any other bards out there with like problem?

TIA,

Sean...
