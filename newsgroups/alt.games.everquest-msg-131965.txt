No significance whatsoever? We shall see.

I  will assume you know the basics of Qabalah, and
therefore know how the Tetragrammaton is central
to the system.

I will further assume you know the role of Gerald
Gardner in Wicca.

This an excerpt from a FAQ on Kabbala;
http://www.veling.nl/anne/templars/faq.htm

"Some of the originators of modern witchcraft
(e.g. Gerald Gardner, Alex Saunders) drew heavily
on medieval ritual and kabbalah for inspiration,
and it is not unusual to find modern witches
teaching some form of kabbalah, although it is
generally even less well integrated into practical
technique than in the case of the Golden Dawn."

If this does not satisfy you, then simply type
Gerald Gardner Kabbala/Qabalah into Google and see
how many people have documented the link.

I have studied, and taught, Tarot for a long time.
Lately, (the last few years), most of the students
that have come to me, have been Wiccans. It is
impossible for anyone to undertake any serious
study of Tarot, without, at some point, referring
to Hermetic Qabalism. The two have become
inextricably intertwined.

I can't speak for all Wiccans everywhere, but the
ones that I have met, have had some familiarity
with Qabalistic teachings. I would be surprised if
any Wiccan did not have that knowledge.

Which is why I said that Wiccans would be familiar
with the Tetragrammaton.

What do you mean by 'inherent connection'?

I guess you don't have to know about the
Tetragrammaton to be a Wiccan, but then I guess
you don't have to know about The Garden of Eden to
be a Christian.
