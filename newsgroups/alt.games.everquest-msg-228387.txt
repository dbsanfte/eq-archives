    Collective rewards rarely motivate players because most players won't
get what they consider an acceptable level of reward for effort expended.
Most collective systems only work when you have people who have motivation
beyond the reward offered and expend considerable effort carrying the
others. I honestly think the modern MMOG player is too jaded to expend that
kind of effort on something that may or may not turn out to be a hot,
long-term game.

    That still doesn't separate achievement level from time played, as the
people that play more will still have done more PvE things than a
likewise-skilled person. It just blurs the curve a bit, and is at best a
temporary solution.

    UO proved that people will gang up to grief. And experience has also
shown that, as long as there's some significant penalty for player death,
assholes will chain-kill people just to make them experience those
penalties. No amount of penalties will stop such people, as their joy at
griefing is much, much greater than the pain you can inflict. The only way
to stop them is to eliminate their ability to attack their prey at all, and
in most cases that means eliminating non-consensual PvP. Once you have
consensual PvP, you'll have people deciding which game appeals to them more:
the PvE one, or the PvP one. Unsurprisingly, most choose PvE.

    Worldly people are an odd bunch. Back in University I would go to the
games days that the local gaming club would put on. Most people would play
one of the popular collectible card games of the day, or one of the fun
board games like Roborally. But there was one small group of four people who
would get out the board version of Civilization, and play that all day and
well into the night. They'd never actually finish a game, and rarely was
someone even eliminated, but they loved to get together and trade resource
cards all day. I never did understand the attraction.

    Diminishing returns doesn't change the fact that, if I jump teams, I
don't get beat up as much and get to share in something good. The only way
you could convince the rational player not to make this choice is if the
time investment in his current character had sufficient value - but you want
to lower the value of time investment, remember?

    RTS games existed before Warcraft, and FPS games existed before Doom.
You can look at those, and the non-clones, and see what worked and what
hasn't worked if you're concerned with certain features. There's been games
before EQ, like UO and Meridian, and PvP didn't work in them. There's been
games since EQ, like DAoC and Shadowbane, and PvP didn't work in them. In
fact, you look at all the games released in the genre, and you soon come to
the conclusion that PvP has yet to be made workable in a MMORPG. Given that
history, I can't blame the guy for saying that it won't work in the next
game, either.
