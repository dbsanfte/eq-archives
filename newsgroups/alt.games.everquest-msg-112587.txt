Actually, Absor's post doesn't specifically mention guilds, but yes,
goods and evils will probably be able to guild together.
Which to me makes more
sense for *some classes*, than the *everyday* grouping of goods and
evils, that occurs on regular servers.

Well, here's to the best of luck, that only more RPers will move in to FV.
Someone said that TLC was misunderstood and that kept away players.
I hope it keeps the non-RPers out.

We shall soon see,
