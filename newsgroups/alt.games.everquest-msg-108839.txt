Thank you SO MUCH for all this information! My printer is working overtime
right now :)

I managed to get to level 3 last night (not a big deal, I know...) but I had
more fun playing this character than I have any other that I've played. I
tried on 3 different occasions to start a cleric - a dwarf and two high
elves.  the dwarf I got to 15 before I deleted him, and both high elves I
got to level 4.

I think I'm going to enjoy this character a LOT more than my others because
there appears to be a LOT of quests that I can do, among other things, and
it'll be a challenge to do things that I've been able to do without a
thought.

Thanks again!
