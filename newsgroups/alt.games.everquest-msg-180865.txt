I don't think it's all that amusing.  I think it's annoying as hell at level
52.  If you aren't in a zone where clerics hang out, (Scarlet Destert, Mons
Letalis, Twilight), you just eat the death.  It sucks.  
They've done away with the need for "player binding".  They've done away with
players making money on ports.   I think it's time they make "zone rezzers", 
just like soulbinders.
(Can you guess, I died in an empty, out of the way zone, again......)
