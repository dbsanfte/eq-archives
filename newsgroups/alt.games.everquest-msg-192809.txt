Go to www.allakhazam.com
Select the link for spells
Don't enter a specific spell
Select your character type
Select Level 1 and click on the "And Higher" button
If you don't want high level AA spells, check "ignore AA"
Hit enter.
Print the resulting page.

This will give you a synopsis of every spell your character can use.

You can also get more detail for each spell, but that's up to you.
