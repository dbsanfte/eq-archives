[More Nonsense]

Late one morning in the middle of the night,
two dead boys got up to fight.
Back to back they faced each other,
drew their swords and shot one another.
The deaf policeman heard the noise
and came and shot the two dead boys.
If you don't believe my story is true,
ask the blind man, he saw it too.
