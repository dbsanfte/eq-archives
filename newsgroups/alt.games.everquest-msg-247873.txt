Don't waste your aa's on the stat boosters.  Get those once you don't have
anything else really useful to spend them on.

You could try quadding the gargs in PoN.  Southeast corner of the zone,
along the east wall of the 'city'.  There are 4 garg spawns perched on the
wall, on a 20 minute timer.  I believe they have about 10-14khp... just a
rough guess though.  Easy to keep ahead of them with sow potions, snare, and
lev to take advantage of the zone wall hill.

Don't play a wizard, so not sure if it is feasible to quad these.... they
are single pullable as well.  I did with necro from 56 to 62, and they give
4% AA per kill as well.

You definately don't want to get hit by them... max hit is 483 if I remember
correctly. Decent loot, average a few k per session at least.

Trickiest part is getting there - you need to run across to the hedge, then
turn south along the zone wall.  Give the PoNb guardians a little room on
the left, and the stick way up on the wall past them - there is a spider
trap in a tree just before the gargs that you don't want to run under.
