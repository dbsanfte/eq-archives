Ow. Now my sides hurt.

Let me just check Sony's annual report:

2003 Operating Revenues (by millions of dollars):

Audio            $1,185
Video            $1,875
Television       $1,546
Information &    $1,568
Communications
Semiconductors   $  442
EverQuest        $    0*
Character Transfers
*Rounded down

So, where exactly did you get this secret insider information as to
how much SOE is making from character transfers? Let me guess. You're
an employee.
