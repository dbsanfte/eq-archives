Seeing as they are considered primarily a neutral/good race I think they
will probably be able to go most places humans can.  There was some
speculation that there are both good and evil Vah Shir, but whether both
will be available to players or even if this rumor is true I don't know.
Obviously as was said noone can know for sure until it comes out, but my
guess will be most places any good race can go.
