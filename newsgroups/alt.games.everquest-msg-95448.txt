Anyone who cares to find out where to turn that stuff in can easily look it
up on any number of websites.  As to not looting, that is likely to be
someone working on getting levels on a twink.  They do not care about the
loot, as it is not worth their time to loot and sell the crap, the time is
better spent killing and getting xp.  Personally, I still loot everything I
kill.
