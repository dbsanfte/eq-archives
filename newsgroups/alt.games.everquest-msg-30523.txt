See thread title.   His factions were reset, and when he respawned at his bind
point, he was suddenly naked and KoS to every giant in the area.

I'd imagine he died at least once before getting enough wits to /quit out or
shut off the computer.   Probably a few times.

And it was probably a major pain to resurrect him afterwards.  Since even
allies become temporarily KoS for corpse dragging in Velious.
