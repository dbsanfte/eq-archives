Arizona is one.  I winter there, and of course noone is on the insane DST at
that time; about a week after I leave, DST begins here in PA, but my friends in
AZ don't change their clocks, so we have to resynchronize our phone call times.

I also have to suffer slow motion "jet lag" driving across country thru 2 time
zone changes, and just after I get back time slips one more hour off from my
accustomed AZ time.

I hear that some "reservations" don't use it in states that do, and that some
do use it in states that otherwise don't.  Just to make things even more
confusing.

Personally, I'd love to see it abolished.  Its a crazy idea originally designed
around rural life in a time without electric lights or rapid transit, its
outdated, useless, and disruptive.
