Beautiful graphics -- but I saw some EQ2 graphics some time back and it
looks like they're going to be just as good as that.  I'll probably have to
upgrade my machine to handle it, but I think EQ2 is going to be an
incredible game, especially for those of us who play from Day 1, before
there are any highlevels, before anybody knows anything about the game
(won't it be fun to wander around trying to learn stuff, not knowing where
to get spells, how to complete quests, anything like that?  No Allakhazam!
You have to figure it all out your own damn self!), before SOE starts
catering to the endgame, etc., etc.  Damn, it's gonna be cool.  And the
screenshots I saw looked unbelievable -- as good as or better than the
Dragon Empires graphics.
