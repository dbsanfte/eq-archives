Low blue is not the same as light blue.  A low blue mob is generally one 
that is still blue, but at the low end of the range.  Like a level 45 mob 
to a level 60 character.

I don't know what your experience is, but every 50+ monk I know solos for 
exp at least some of the time.  Hell, I'm a 60 bard and I can go melee 
solo certain solid-blue mobs.  Now that I have my 60 second 31% slow, I 
should be able to pretty much kick ass on quite a few blue mobs.  
When you're bored some day, go into Sol B and see who is doing bats/bugs.  
Or go to Velks Lab off hour and look for monks soloing the spiders.
