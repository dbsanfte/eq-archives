Ok Im a 44 Cleric rapidly gaining on 50... er something like that.
I have done a little search on the Cleric Epic, but I am having issues
locating "any" info on it.
	Anyone have a guide or a link to one that covers the path to
success in this endeavor?  
	At 44 should I not even be thinking of it? or should I have
been looking into it for a while already?
	As usual your tips and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
