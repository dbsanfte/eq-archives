    The spore covered armor is good, but it is not magical; the gloves won't
help for hitting magic creatures. (Also, the fungoids that drop them are
much too tough for 11th level.)

    If you can, find someone who can make you some Wu's gloves; not only are
these magical, but they are a light source, nice if you are a human monk.
If you're broke, you might try going to Innothule Swamp and killing
frogloks; they drop mesh and woven armor, which *is* magical, as well as
being very light.  Newbie trolls running around might well have pieces they
would be willing to sell you cheap, too.
