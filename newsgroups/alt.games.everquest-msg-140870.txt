Nope, it's all gear that i personally killed and looted.  The majority of
his nodrop loot (possibly all his no-drop loot excluding the thurg quest) is
from Skyshrine.  The earring, weapons, mask, shoulders etc

I grouped with a top notch mage yesterday (read: millions of plat, probably
best geared on the server) and he made a very noticable difference to the
group... but yeah, 56 would probably be high enough for my mage to go.

Of course I will.. I just think your wron.. er nm :)

And if resists are an issue?

Do you think id be sacrificing a lot in just getting the next dainc rown
that rots?  nice ac, resists, customisable! and guk is oh so far away....

Hmm I thought mana conservation was a different slot (ring?).. isn't earring

For just raw HP/Mana...   the velium BS sees to stand out by far...  should
be very cheap to buy too

Ring is a slot that I always make a focus item (ring and bracer.. dunno why)
I need to go check the focus effects again i guess

Shissar scale enough of an upgrade, to go and get one?  (If i hadn't planned
on exping in the grey)

Hmm I used to have a spider fur belt on him for a long time, upgrading it
when i was <200 int.. time to change back I guess.   Dregs - never ever see
them being killed.. wonder if theres a reason for that?

My new wiz had a frozen orb that I sold recently.. doh

Both are droppable right?  I don't really wanna ask for loot thats not
needed, but can be sold for the guild bank.   Of course if its ND and
rotting, thats ok!

Well I figured quest legs would be good enough, to not need an upgrade..
how wrong I was huh

>For feet, go get a pair of Coldain Skin Boots.

Think the upgrade is enough over eboots to be worth while?   I also have
some haste boots that I swap in and out on him when Im in a meleeing mood
(my weapon procs ash)

/cry
I was so happy when I got the shoulders, mask etc... they are really nice
items (imo) but now suck, because crappier easier more common junk loot has
the focus items

At what point (over 200 int) does int > mana?   ie xxx mana = x int..
before and after 200?
