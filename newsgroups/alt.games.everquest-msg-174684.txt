CHAIN SMOKER:
I guess when you're wrong, any small victory will do, eh Busterboo?

SHARON:
I'm not wrong. You are.

WAYNE BAGGULEY FINISHES THIS THREAD WITH MUCH KEEN INSIGHT:

WAYNE BAGGULEY:
I think he mean that there is no such thing as colour outside of human
perception. For example, the mass of an object is a physical property
of that object and it exists outside of human perception. Colour, on the
other hand, is not an inherent property of an object, it is a human
perception of the wavelength of light that the object reflects. In other
words, there is no way of measuring the colour of an object without using
human experience in the determination.

SHARON:
Thank you so much Wayne for that input. You are 100% on the money,
as to what I was attempting to explain to that man. Thanks.

How is that a lie?

Looks pretty close to me, dude!

Hmm.  I winder why you write, "actually, there is no such thing as color,"
when the whole statement was, "Well actually, there is no such thing as
'color'.  What you see when you see 'color' is actually the rays of light,
being asorbed or reflected.  It is perceived by the eye as 'color'."
Hmm...   Golly jeebers, dude.

SHARON:
Thank You 386 for that very comprehensive analysis of this
tedious, annoying discussion. Some people just REFUSE to give up,
even when they've repeatedly been shown they're in error.

 Tom:
Chain, I noticed that you had a different perspective on life in 1997.
How long have you been using the joe@noname.com address?

Chain Smoker:
Since about 1999 or 2000, not exactly sure now.  I wasn't using it in 1997,
at any rate, as I was not on Usenet at that time.

Sharon:
I guess when you're caught with your hands down your drawers, any lie will
do, eh Chain Smoker?

CHAIN SMOKER IS THIS " JOE@NONAME.COM "
LOCATED BY THAT GOOD OLE FRIEND OF YOUR'S AND MINE KNOWN AS "MR. GOOGLE"...
WAY BACK FROM 1997!
Aw man, YOU are nasty chain smoker...
