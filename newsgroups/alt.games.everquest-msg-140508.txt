Two reasons:

1- actions are louder than words
2- you've been verbally beaten to a pulp, ergo no challenge

You can't talk your way out of a paper bag and beating you over the head
with words has become boring since you've proven to be at a constant
disadvantage.

Next will be to see if you can put up where your mouth is. You've been
really good at making physical threats to people all over Usenet. Now you're
being called on it at your own expense. Maybe you'll finally have some
respect for the people you love to antagonize after this trip.
