yep  i actually fininshed my gaming session then went and printed the map, by
then i didn't need it to know my way around it's just nice to be able to mark
certain merchants / spell locs / quest givers etc.

True i gave a guy(?) directions  to the new quest giver in the ench/wiz guild
while sat on the newbie log in nek forest.

Haven't got luclin yet, i like to wait a couple of months until the majority of
stuff gets fixed and the price comes down (so i guess i'm cheap  hehe) but
again your showing your experience - train sense heading, make a hot key, stuff
a newbie will be learning from scratch - like i said it will take time. Maybe
not a lot of time but a lot more than you or i starting a new char.

I don't care what is written about me so long as it isn't true.
