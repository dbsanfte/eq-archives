Any hints on hunting in Mons Letalis?  I've got a 51 mage who
has been stuck there (51).  T-boost and Lev rings mean no problem 
pulling to a pet, I just don't know where to go looking, a good
spot to park the pet/med.  I poked my nose in there and took
down a couple of Shiknar like things (they have the same model
as the shiknar in paludal) at 49.  They hit about as hard as
the elemental warriors in the hole, but I'm unsure of there HP
relative to said warriors.  

Leveling a couple of kitties, I've been real happy with the <35
zones on the moon.  I was hoping for something equivalent to 
Paludal/Marus Seru for 50+ :)
