First of all, if it was no drop why would we need the TCC? It's not
going to be farmed after all. :-)
But seriously, I am in a medium sized guild and I doubt I or about 80%
of the EQ population would find this hard to do based on guild tags on
high level characters.

If the item is good it will be camped regardless. TCC or no.

There's something called the Play nice policy that already does that.
Without I might add removing my ability to go get a non camped item I
happen to want that's on a green.

The latest interview said they aren't sure if the TCC will be in or
not, so maybe it won't if we make them realize how antagonistic this
part of the Vision(TM) is to the players.

Then you need to exercise the Play nice rules, that's what they are
there for.

True.

Exactly what I said, but that is not farming that is acquiring a neat
item.

Never mentioned the AC.

Sometimes that's true but there has always been an explanation that it
was possible for me to see both sides of it, this one I can't there is
no way TCC will do anything but harm the game.

I intend to quit. October 16th. I may be back later I don't know. I
have a big problem with post 50 EQ.
