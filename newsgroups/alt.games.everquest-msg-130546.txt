Then why not snip it?

Had she said 'no' I *might* have said "may I offer you 15 plat?" which 
is what I WAS offering.

Had she said 'no' again I would have left her alone.

Thanks for assuming that.  I've played a caster, I know what it's like.  
I almost always answer bind requests because I know what a pain in the 
ass it can be.  I *especially* help out the races who have trouble with 
faction.  I'm not saying she *had* to help me, but a simple no would 
have been nice, rather than bullshit.  And I gave her the benefit of the 
doubt and assumed she'd somehow been misinformed about it.  I told her 
how it worked, and she still doubted me, then told me she was camping.  
My response was, and I QUOTE:

okay then.  thanks.

And then I told her again that just so she knew, it worked on anyone.  I 
then went back to killing gnolls for faction, and being afraid to go 
into town.  I was *especially* afraid of that bitch roaming Q Hills who 
liked killing my SK.  I had no idea how she'd react to me and she likes 
to pop up any old place.

Then the second person I offered 15 plat to outright.  He said no and 
didn't give a reason.  Shall I quote myself again?

damn. okay. thanks.

And he responded with "you'll just have to be a bit more careful maybe 
for awhile."  A bit annoying, as he didn't know what I wanted the bind 
for, but what the hell.  I gave up on him too, and went on my way, and 
finally found someone willing to do it for free.

Now tell me where I harassed anyone for a bind.  I corrected one girl on 
what seemed to be a rather large error on her part.  I offered a kid who 
seemed awfully low level to me a fairly large sum of money to zone twice 
then go back to killing the big bad scrawny gnolls with maybe a bit more 
spell money under his belt.  And finally, I found a person willing to do 
so.

As to people claiming that direct tells are rude, personally if it's me 
and one other person in the zone, I find /ooc's bother me.  It's like 
the person's too stupid to do a /who and see that he might as well just 
/tell me what he wants.  So hey, people are screwed either way.

I posted the original log because I thought that was a rather amusing 
snippet.  I'm amazed at the bitching I've gotten for what was, oh, maybe 
2 seconds of typing on their side (or would have been, had she said 'no, 
not right now').

Ryou
