I worked on a YMP2 in 1991. It was faster than any PCs at that time.
And I continue to believe its faster than many PCs built today. Now,
I don't consider a SGI Violet as a PC, its a workstation.

As I mentioned, teraflops. Thats more flops than a pcs flops.

I found a web page that said that high end pcs are faster than 1970s
crays. Do your own web search and argue with the people claiming it.

I don't have any fantasys dealing with computers.  I made a silly
statement about how if I could afford a Cray I would play Everquest
on it. If you saw something else in that post, it wasn't in there.
