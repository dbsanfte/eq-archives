While I'm not very offended by "Dick", I'm particularly annoyed by 
"sucks" as a pejorative.

Sucks should be a positive word.

I can't think of an instance in which discovering that a potential sex 
partner sucks would be a dissapointment.

And yet there it is, even in the language of 7 year olds on nickolodeon 
comedies.

I guess Gay/Ghey offends on this same level; its a stupid use of a word 
which has negative implications feeding back towards the original, but 
many if not most of the people using it are fairly oblivious to the fact 
that this could be a problem; they know its offensive, but that gives 
using it a frission.

I think the whole thing is palinilap
