It's fun but can be frustarting. I got EQ going, but have no manual.
The one that comes on the CD doesn't work, I think because of the
patches, not sure though. I've found sites that have it, but so far
can't download one, I'll get it in time.

When you go up a level, do you get new points to add to your stats?
How, do you add them to the stat you'd like to, if you get em?
The Everlore web site seems to be good, any others?
When you equip something where can you see what it does for your
stats?
If you have two items in your inventorey that look kind of the same,
how can you see what is what. For example, I have that damn beginners
short sword taking up space in my inventory and a rusty broad sword,
can I tell some how which is which?
If I drown how do I get my body back?
Whats a GM?
Who is Varent?

Thanks
