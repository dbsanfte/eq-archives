Till level 10 or so there is almost no difference between classes their
melee dps. Gear does make a difference ofcourse.

But if you don't want to keep a group alive and forget about dps you should
switch to a more dps or tank focussed class :).

you get hurt I get half the exp? erm sorry don't understand that one :(

At lower levels there is almost no skill required. Heck even at 65 in places
like PoV and BoT skill is also just a secondairy next to gear. And nobody
will ask you for it.
