I'd say don't even put 1 practice point into fishing.  Increase your skill
from 0 to 100 doing nothing but making hooks, lures, and other "baiting"
materials.  After skill 100.  My reason for saying this is because after
increasing your first 100 points in this way, you can truly say you are a
"master" at being a "baiter". :)
This would personally be my most fun reason to reach fishing skill 100.  For
the title you'd be able to give yourself (a 100 skill in fletching is a
"master Fletcher", 100 in baking is a "master baker", 100 in tailoring is a
"master tailor", a 100 skill in baiting hooks is a...).
