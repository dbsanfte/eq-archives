Likewise here.  As primary healer (or in the CHeal chain) I might
not use DL but it's extremely useful as a situational heal.   There's
just nothing else that can heal that much that fast...

Healing's always a question of being in front of the damage curve.
For mobs that don't require a CHeal chain, it's easier to get a
primary healer using CHeal and secondary clerics using DL and
CE to make sure the CHeal lands than to chance not being able
to land CHeals from a chain due to lag or just bad luck with the
RNG.
