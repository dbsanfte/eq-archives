There's usually 1 or 2 "top-content" guilds per server.  But many more
lower ones.

On luclin, there are two guilds doing TSS raiding, having already
tapped out DK, but my guild (concidered third top) is currently
farming Demi (both 2 teirs, have not attempted MM yet), and one or two
flags away from being DK flagged.

There are a number of guilds that are getting close, or just started
entering Demi.  So if you're L70 with at least 100 AAs, you wouldn't
be allowed to app in my guild until you had at least 400 or 500AAs,
but you should find a guild that would take you.
