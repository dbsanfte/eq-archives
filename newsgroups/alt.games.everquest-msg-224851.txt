Hi all!

Just a Q about the PoF breakin, my guild did it last weekend... no wait, the
one before... oh i can't remember but anyway we did it recently, except for
the actual breakin the leadership decided to take in a single group while
the rest of us waited outside for them to clear it.

Now, with all due respect to the authority of raid leaders (if someone takes
the time to organise a raid I'm damn well going to follow their
instructions), is that really wise? It certainly worked, but why would you
take in a single group of 65's when you have 4-5 groups available, at least
2 of which would be all 60+?

A penny for your thoughts :)

Cheers,
James
