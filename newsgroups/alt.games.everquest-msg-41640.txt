I'll tell you a frustrating story.  Last week, I had a group of guildies in
CoM doing the front spawns. I got a tell and was offered 200pp to go pick
those doors.  Unfortunately, I had not kept my lockpick skill up to max and
wasn't able to help. DOH! Oh well...the next night saw my clicking on the
locked door in East Freeport for 2 hours maxing my skill. I'm ready now...
