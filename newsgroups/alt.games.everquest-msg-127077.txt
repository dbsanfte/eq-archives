Not in this case. The twilight armor, with a few exceptions, is so bad
compared to the class armors on a risk/time versus reward basis it
would *never* be worth it, even on a new server.

I recall when Luclin came out, I just started on the FV server (which
at the time was still fairly new, had no L60s and few in the 50s) for
shits and giggles. Totally untwinked of course. Even then, I could not
see myself sparing any time whatsoever getting the twilight armor for
my warrior there, or any money had there been any kind of market for
the stuff.

The gorget was all right, and I managed to get that myself, but the
rest is junk and that goes for most or all the other classes too.
Twilight armor is grossly unbalanced on the weak crappy side even for
new servers. It's one of those things that makes you wonder if the
designer actually plays EQ.

Those days will never be seen again in EQ and its debatable whether or
not one would see them in another MMORPG now that people are more
attuned to how the genre works.
