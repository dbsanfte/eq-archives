No, I don't agree. This restriction makes you choose what spells
are important at any given time. Its one of the few strategic choices in
the game. The only thing I might like to see is to give wizards 9 spells
at 30th level and 10 spells at 40th level. Wizards need help, badly.

Agreed.

Not a big deal really.

Agreed. An automap should be in for all modern games. It was fun to
map on the Apple 2+ with the Wizardry game, now its just a chore.

Very much agreed. That staring at the spell book thing is THE absolutely
worst design decision in a game I have ever seen. Period. Its almost as
bad as not allowing saves in a single player game. It is just stupid to
blind and bore the player. MY CHARACTER IS MEDITATING, NOT ME DAMMIT!!!
