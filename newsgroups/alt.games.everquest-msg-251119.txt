Oooh, man. Reminds me of a theater in Pensacola, FL. Instead of
couches, you had four swivel, high backed chairs that shared a
small table. There was what was basically a snack bar at the back
of the theater that sold beer, wine, and your basic snack bar items
(nachos, hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, pizza, etc.) They didn't
show first-run movies, either, but I think I was able to watch
Ghostbusters at five times in that theater. :)
