Ah. I love TSing. I played a tailor in UO and a weaponsmith in SWG,
and I'm torn between going for carpenter or cook in EQ2. Because of
the way the various buffs work in EQ2 TSing, it's a lot more like
combat than drag/click/repeat. (There's nothing like sitting there,
making your jum-jum pie, and seeing message like "So-and-so was hit
for 250 points of damage due to Frayed Material!" I've seen more
people die at sewing tables than at forges. Tragic.)
