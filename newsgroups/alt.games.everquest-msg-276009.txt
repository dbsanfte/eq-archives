Not terribly impressed, but it looks like a fun package and I didn't mind 
shelling out $4.95 to see the new content. Cheap. I knew when I first heard 
about "Adventure Packs" that they would be greeted this way. There's not 
enough to get anyone excited, and just enough to give SOE critics new grist 
for the mill. Strange marketing indeed. You would think with WoW falling all 
over itself with success, that SOE would be more interested in strengthening 
its base rather than polarizing it further.

That puzzled me, too, although as a level 40 I'm pleased that there will be 
more content to pursue. Not that there's exactly a shortage of things to do 
now ...  I think part of the reasoning here is that players who've made it 
into the 30's and 40's are at a critical juncture and need more loving than 
the ones who are still fresh from their teens and 20's. I don't have any 
hard data on this, but I believe I see more players leaving at 30 than at 
20.
