I'm no expert, but I have spent a lot of time trying to understand
the problem, and my best answer is that they think we're *morally*
weak.

They think we don't have the fortitude necessary to take serious
action.  They think we don't want to take any time away from our
TV football and our Playstations.  They think we're too decadent
to forego our comforts to go trudging around the desert risking
our lives looking for terrorists in their hidey-holes.  They think
that we'll forget about the attack the next time "Who Wants To Be
A Millionaire" comes on TV.

And part of the reason they believe that is because they're
half right.  How quickly did we lose interest in the embassy
bombings, or the bombing of the Cole, or even the original
WTC bombing?

But they've miscalculated, they haven't realized that when
we finally *do* come together on something, we're some of
the toughest, most tenacious sons-of-bitches on the planet.

Saddam Hussein miscalculated that way too -- after the
Gulf war was over, Iraqi defectors who had held high
positions in the Hussein government told us that the
Iraqis truly had not believed that we would go to war
with them, they thought all the deadlines and diplomacy
were just big bluffs.  They thought if we spent so much
time talking about war and making threats, it was because
we weren't ready for war; if we had actually wanted war,
they thought, we'd just have attacked and not kept
jawing about it.

Surprise.

There are now T-shirts and mugs available on the web
that have a picture of Bin Laden's face and the caption,
"Uh oh, I really fucked up this time!"  That may actually
be a more astute political analysis than many of the
more "learned" essays I've read recently in the papers.
