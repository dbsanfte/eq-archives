I think much of the opposition comes from a (justified) fear that
in-game sale of items will lead to the game becoming more expensive to
play.  Want to see the interesting new zones?  No problem, but you'll
have to fork over $3 for a new sword if you want to survive.

People don't like unpredictable cost models, which is one of the
reasons many will happily pay $50/month for phone service with
unlimited long-distance--even if their total bill on a metered plan
would be less.

I predict this will go over like a lead balloon, for the above reasons.

From the article:

  Racing game enthusiasts, for example, will be able to buy a faster 
  car to give them an edge in the game for a slight bit more, should 
  they wish. 

I really doubt that's going to fly.  "I paid $50 for this lousy game,
and now they want me to pay more to race the car I want!?"

It might be possible to manage it with a game that sells for $10, and
makes up the extra by selling in-game upgrades, I guess.  (Following
the model of Magic: The Gathering.)

Probably won't affect it at all.

If it does, it'll kill the game.  Vanguard will promptly get a
reputation as "that game where you have to pay for uber equipment if
you want to see any of the content", regardless of whether it's
justified or not.  I really don't see that happening, however, given
McQuaid's opinions.
