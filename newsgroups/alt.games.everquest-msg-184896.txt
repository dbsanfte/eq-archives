Um,

Try the Aqua Goblins in ButcherBlock Mountains for FAB loot (About 4pp a
drop)
Else... Go to Estate of Unrest via BBM -> Dagnor's Cauldron -> Unrest for
better XP.  Aqua goblins won't give XP but will give great loot.

I've been doing the hermit in SK, he is very easy and good experience.

Unfortunately the loot is very poor. Nine time out ten he drops a few
silver, every now and then he'll drop 1P, and very rarely he'll have a
fine steel weapon. At this rate I won't have anywhere near the PP I
need to buy the druid spells at 24 (why are they so expensive ? I have
no money at all, it was like 100P to buy the ones at 19 and I only
-just- managed to afford them, how can I possibly afford the next ones
?)

I tried paludal caverns but I don't like walking around with a black
screen, it's way too dark in there.

Is there anywhere else I can go that has even half decent experience
and more importantly decent loot so I can afford to buy these spells ?

Cheers,
