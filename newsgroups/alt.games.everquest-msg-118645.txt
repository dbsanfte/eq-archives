Just received the monthly EQ newsletter. Check this out:

Greetings Adventurers!
Open up new solo gameplay possibilities you've only dreamed about. Got two
computers? Use the free account key provided in this email and your existing
software to start a second account and play two characters together -- at
the same time! How cool would it be to build a cleric or druid of your own
and have them at your fingertips for buffs, healing and more? Or better yet,
get a friend to join you by giving him or her this free account key. Now
your friend has no excuse not to come adventure with you. Or even better
still, invite a family member. Remember, the family that plays together
stays together.

Whatever direction you choose to go, you can't go wrong! Below is an
EverQuest Trilogy account key that will open a new EQ account for a FREE 30
DAY TRIAL. Take advantage of this opportunity to enrich your EverQuest
experience before this promotion expires on June 30th, 2002. The enclosed
account key is good for a free 30-day subscription (regular account charges
applicable thereafter) and requires the EverQuest Trilogy software.

Your EverQuest Trilogy Account Key: XXXXXXXXX

The Xs are an actual working key to start a new account replaced with Xs by
me just in case I want to use my key :) . Pretty neat idea for families who
don't want to pay for an extra copy.
