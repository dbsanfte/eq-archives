Chance of a skill-up is affected by level differential (you vs. mob)
and relevent stat (AGI for defensive skills I think).  In my lo-50s
I know my Paladin went hours between melee skill-ups soloing dark
blues at times, other times I'd get several in quick succession, and
once (only) I got two skill-ups off a light blue mob, thank you RNG.

But your suspicion about hitting caps might be (almost) right on,
depending on the Bard's level he may well be at his pre-51 Dodge cap,
for instance.
