>>>Corrected a problem with a 'quest' for the hermit in South Karana.<<<

In a perfect world, this would mean there is a now finish to the Unkempt
druid quest involving their leader Jale Phlintoes. (Ask who is "Jale
Phlintoes" around Surefall Glade to get the back story).

...however this being the real world the dead-end quest has probably been
removed.

For those not in the loop, you could go to the hermit and tell him (if he
was actually still alive). [I want to join the Unkempt Druids] or some close
proximity to that and the hermit would respond  along the lines of  "Then
wait here and wait for Jale to arrive." The problem was Jale never spawned.
