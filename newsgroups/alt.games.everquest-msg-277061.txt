yes, i had played D&D a little bit when i was 7 or 8, with the older kids 
next door, and then again i played about the time i was in junior high. 
nothing serious, nothing on a set schedule, but some friends and i would 
play from time to time.  the only computer games i had really played before 
EQ1 were sports games, not counting my countless atari 2600, nintendo, SNES, 
and sega genesis time.  i'm not sure what you mean by live action, but i 
cant think of anything ive ever done that would fit the conversation!

honestly, i only started playing because a coworker who was soon to be 
promoted to be my boss asked me to check it out, adn i wanted to kiss his 
ass!!
