}lvl 26 rogue lookin for advice on which trade to work one...

Poisonmaking and pottery.  Maybe fletching.

}what makes you the easiest/fastest money ?

-Not- doing tradeskills.  Tradeskills are for losing money, not making it.

}p.s. i now have 45 practice points available to me and they're burnin a
}whole in my shorts...lol... ;-)

You might want to spend them on poisonmaking.  I would never advocate 
spending skill points on any other tradeskill, though.  You can only use 
skill points to raise your skill to 21, except in poisonmaking, and that 
is generally a cheap and painless process without spending your points.
