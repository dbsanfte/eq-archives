oh, how I wish it were so. but, not in this case.
the wizard spell is called "invisibility to undead", while for the other
classes who get a similar spell, it's called "invisibility vs. undead"
the two are NOT interchangeable. I've tried. bought the "invis vs. undead"
spell, and it told me that I must attain level 61 before I could scribe the
spell...and if I remember correctly, this is Verant's way of saying "get a
clue, you can't use this spell"
