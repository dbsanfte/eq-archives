    It is the cleric's job to keep the group members alive, above all,
IMHO.  Other priest types should defer to what the cleric deems is the
best healing strategy.  However, if the cleric is showing that they are
not good at their job (and I think that 3 deaths caused by missing a CH
on a tank rather than a because of a disastrous pull certainly counts),
then the other priests should step in.  From how you describe it, is
sounds like the cleric was an idiot to be avoided.

   But I wonder about your last sentence.  This happens quite often? 
What server are you on that has so many idiot clerics?  It's interesting
to me because I'm just right now in the process of learning how to
properly balance the timing of my HOT, CH, and SupHeal (these are the 3
heals I usually have memmed).  I'm normally casting on  my husband
Lenny, a 46 level ogre warrior with approx. 3k HP's buffed by me with
temp.  I usually try to keep him alive with my HOT... Lenny spends alot
of time in battle glowing softly.  If he gets to 40-30% health I will
cast a CH.  If he were at 20% I would be a bit nervous... I like to keep
him higher than that. At 20%, I would probably throw on a HOT if there
were time, then a SupHeal, then a CH depending on how close to dead the
mob is.  If I were in a group with a druid and Lenny were at 20% and the
druid threw on a heal I wouldn't be the least bit angry.  But if the
same druid continuously threw on heal when he is higher than than then I
might get a bit annoyed... after all, I am the main healer of the
group.  I don't very often see Lenny die because I missed a heal, and
never since I got CH (though he did get down to 3% once before it hit...
he was at his computer whining "Honey... Honey... HONEY!!"  when it hit.
This is when I learned that sometimes it might be wise to throw on a
SupHeal first).  

   I dunno... Very few clerics get past CH age without grouping or
duoing fairly often, I believe.  And this cleric clearly had grouping
issues.
