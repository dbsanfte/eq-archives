The CPU at that point is your bottleneck.

Keep in mind that with all the RAM your box can handle and a top of the line
video catd, your processor still has to be able to handle it all when push
comes to shove. 500 MHz is not going to cut it, even though it's acceptable
according to Verant's ridiculously understated minimum specs for Luclin.
Best to go up to 1GHz or more; AMD Duron chips appear to be very affordable
right now.

Verant has *really* misled people with the minimum specs for Luclin. People
with those spece(including myself with an AMD 450MHz) are going to have
trouble with Luclin, if indeed they can really play there at all.

In raid situations, even with an upgraded CPU, you'll probably STILL find
that you have to make little adjustments like turning off PC names, turning
down particle effects, or even turning them off completely.
