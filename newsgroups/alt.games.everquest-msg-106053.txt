 Just takes one unintended aggro to get them on you. Even if you stand
and die you could be just close enough in aggro range that when you die
the adds will aggro on the raid.  Vius not really any different that how
we go about taking out Vyemm.

 We do scout. I'll usually run in far enough to where I can send in my
eye to check it out. Even the good items are starting to lose their
appeal with what a pain he can be.

 That's what we've been doing. I think it's been awhile since we've
actually fought any of his guards. However, I've been wondering if there
isn't a better way to debuff rather than pulling him to the raid and
hoping they land and not resisted while people start dying. Maybe have
run by debuffing, where enchanters and shaman aren't near the rest of
the raid. That way if slow doesnt land, shaman dies (which happens
anyway) and puller just continues to train him around while cleric goes
to res for another go around.
