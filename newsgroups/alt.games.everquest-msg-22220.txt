These are natural mistakes.

A real idiot.

I'm standing around ECommons and someone is repeatedly
/shout WTB plate armor with stat bonuses that a halfling druid could use

So I go to /tell and say
"You might have better luck using /auc to pick up a few sellers"
"I have small scarab breast plate, would you be interested in buying that"
Few more
/shout WTB plate armor with stat bonuses that a halfling druid could use
I get a /reply
"I don't know what are the specs on it?"
I reply "AC 14, some str and dex" whatever it was.
Few more
/shout WTB plate armor with stat bonuses that a halfling druid could use
So I /who druid and come up empty on him
So I /who <his name> and come up with I think it was a level 6 or 9 halfling
cleric
The
/shout WTB plate armor with stat bonuses that a halfling druid could use
are still coming fast and furious.
So I /tell him
"BTW: You know you are not a druid but a cleric right?"
Silence at last!
