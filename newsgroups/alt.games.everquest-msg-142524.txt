No you are criticizing the factory owner who saw a starving child and said
cmere kid ill feed ya if you carry these lunch bags to those 50 people.
There was no force involved and the `rich man` did it out of kindness as
well as self interest.

Your first remedy would have been to tell the owner he could not do that.
When people mentioned that the child went back to starving you got upset.
You tried other methods

You fed the kid and he grew up . You fed the kid till he was 57. This kinda
upset you also so now you steal georges money to feed the kid and you
specifically ask not to know anything about what the kid is doing these
days.

Things got better for EVERYONE . The least member of our society does so
much better in a capitalistic society than any other. People do not realize
the might have beens . I know that a man making 30k a year now is making
only a fraction of what he would have been making if we where as free as
intended but it is hard to explain it so that it can be understood. I can
explain it but it takes awhile . A good primer on economics is a good start
and should be required for everyone. Our goverment and teachers though have
a vested intrest in NOT teaching our children.
