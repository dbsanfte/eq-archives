There is an easy quest in POP to get a mana pres 2 item.  You can buy
the items (HQ cougar hide, cockatrice beak) from vendors or the
bazaar.  Cost me about 100pp total when I did it.  Check Alakazams for
the POP quest details.

There is also a very easy POP quest to get a spell casting haste 2
item. All you need is sarnak blood and invisibility.

The other POP antique item quests are also not difficult but the
components are harder to come by.  I got the healing focus 2 item but
had to camp stuff in Dawnshroud waiting for a specific spawn.
