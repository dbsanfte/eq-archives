I've not seen a mob fail to change targets when its target uses
DA/DB since they made the agro/hate patch oh so long ago.  Players
used to take advantage of DA in tough fights by having oom Clerics
and badly hurt Paladins cast DA and then sit right next to the mob,
which would then beat upon the invulnerable toon while the rest of
the group/raid beat on it.  DA/DB is the biggest situational agro
modifier out there, the mob attacks anybody else it hates at all
rather than you.  Since it would be rare that a mob would attack a
Cleric while being totally unaware of the other players in the
Cleric's group/raid, I see no reason to delay backing off after
casting.

If the mob still comes after you when DA/DB wears off then somebody
isn't managing agro properly (either you got way too much hate, which
could conceivably be unavoidable in some circumstances, or the Ranger
who's trying to save you forgot that he had his hate reducing buff up,
or something like that).
