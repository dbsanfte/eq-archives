Always in the top 5 gripes on EQ anyone puts out is 'you cannot solo at 
all'. Which isn't true, but it is certainly more difficult to be an 
effective soloer (compared to group player) than in any other PC based 
game I'm aware of.

I've noticed that if people can solo, they will, except for people who 
know each other already.

Game's a week old. People are too busy rushing the levels at the moment. 
And who knows, EQ2 may not turn out to be a very scial game in the end. 
EQ1 was, though mainly the constant chatter went on with your guild.

Grind is a state of mind.
This isn't a path to adventure, this path is the adventure.
Platitudes aside, Grind or not depends on your desire to have fun. Yes 
if you go over and sit in the corner in Dreadlands (EQ1 zone) killing 
the same 3 types of mobs for 8 levels it is an empty boring drag. 
However, with enough places to go, and going enough places, things were 
not the grind most people made it into. Also, there's a big 'I'm just 
grinding to get to <insert level cap> as fast as I can, then I can have 
fun' mentality among the MMOG'er community.
I can't comment on the combat, but except for Drab groups, and probably 
Warriors, I never found EQ combat really all that passive. (Hulk smash 
taunt button. Hulk smash kick button. Hulk wait and repeat).

Course I was an enchanter, and I liked to go the kind of places where 
groups feared to tread without an enchanter along.
/puller tells the group, "Inc 3"
/g Ready
/puller tells the group, "oops 5"
/g cool, ready.
/puller tells the group, "ur 7 mb 9"
/druid tells the group, "evac ready"
/g naa I got em.


Oh and about rats... wait till they put some big mean old rats in 
somewhere. There were these rats in a dragon graveyard in EQ1 that were 
quite mean.

Actually, I find in these games I often use the mouse for nothing but 
mouselook when I get used to the controls. Much less likely to click the 
wrong spell or button or whatever when in a hurry.

Final Fantasy online I take the mouse and set it on the shelf over my 
monitor, to get it out of my way, since it doesn't really do mouselook.

I assume that's to have them host the screenshots? (If not, go to 
http://www.fraps.com and you can make your own screenshots and host them 
where you will). It takes a fair amount of work to maintain a decent 
looking web presence for your character and guild. (I have done so in 
the past) I'd pay a bit extra not to have that load on my hands.
