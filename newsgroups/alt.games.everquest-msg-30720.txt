No clue what a hoary robe is, but the "epic" is an item, unique to your
player class, which you get at the end of a (usually) tremedously long,
dangerous, difficult, aggrivating quest which you generally won't be
able to do until you're quite high in levels. For instance, warriors get
the Jagged Blade of War.  However, you generally need a pretty damn good
guild to get it, since it will require several planes raids and the
death of a few dragons to get all the components you need.
  Each class has their own. Go to alhakazam's site and look under quests
by class. You can find them all.
