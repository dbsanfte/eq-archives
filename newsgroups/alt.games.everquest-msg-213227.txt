Was in Rathe Mtns today where my 36 shaman is hunting for exp.  Of course 
there are lots of high lvlers there who are killing just for the plat.  That 
doesn't bother me too much though.  Main reason I am there is because I only 
own EQ Classic at the time so my exp choices are limited until Evolution shows 
up.  So as a soloing Shaman my strategy has to be root/dot/med rinse and 
repeat.  I've got a hill giant rooted and fully dotted.  He's down to 60-some 
percent when all of a sudden some idiot starts beating on it.  I run over 
there and say 'I got this one' and the idiot says 'He hit me first'.  I was 
like 'That's cause it's rooted'.  Anyone knows a rooted mob is still gonna 
attack.  Now this is a high lvl character and he should know that if he runs 
close to a rooted mob it's gonna hit him.  So right after he finished the kill 
another giant comes along and he says 'You can have this one then'.  So I 
proceed to root it and he proceeds to beat on it til it's dead.  What an 
IDIOT.
