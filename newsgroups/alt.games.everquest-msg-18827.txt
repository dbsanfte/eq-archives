Sure, just map it to an Ability and make a macro that looks like

/pause #, /doability ##
/pause #, /doability ##
/pause #, /doability ##
/pause #, /doability ##
/doability ##

... where # is (delay before you can bash again in seconds * 10) and ## is 
the number of the ability.

This will crank out five bashes in a row.

I use this trick to have sfood (supply food) and sdrink (supply drink) 
macros as a magician. That way I have an easier time when I first log on 
doing all the handy magician i-cast-all-my-supplies stuff.

A note to magicians- make sure you have a bag open(by opening it in 
Inventory and closing Inventory w/out closing the bag) so you can drop them 
in as they summon, otherwise they will clobber each other.

Damn I wish they stacked.
