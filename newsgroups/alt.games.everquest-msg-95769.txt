I would bet that most (most) players remem spells immediately after they die
(Of course, there are exceptions in players, circumstances and classes). I
would also bet that it isn't very often most (most) players are walking
around without any spells memmed.

If criteria was set to qualify a LD as a genuine problem (In other words,
not a pulled plug), the people who pull the plug would try to make that
criteria before pulling the plug.

I don't know whether they can or not. I would believe they could.

Sometimes (sometimes) your computer crashing isn't their fault. Your "shitty
ISP" connection isn't their fault.

May not be your fault either but (sometimes) it is more your fault then
theirs. If only by comparison.

What solution do you (hughes, not Jerimah) propose for the bards then?

(Bards rule! Mine just dinged to 21 last night and can now use that teleport
song. Whee! Now the bard just needs to go to a safer zone where it can test
the song out.)

I wish my laziness would get me a popular MMORPG. Some guys have all the
luck. 8)

This is the true story of a bard who went linkdead and died.

Worst link death ever. (In my experience with my characters.)

My bard was taking a journey across Norrath sightseeing in every zone she
could get to to see the sights, get a taste of the local flavor.

While putzing around in Qeynos she discovered that the green corrupt guards
would agro on her when she sat down to med/remem spells (They would not agro
otherwise.) She decided sit in the path of a corrupt Qeynos guard so it
would agro on her. (Why? Only because I could.) She did, it did, they fought
and then... linkdeath by lost ISP connection.

(FYI, if you have Earthlink, Mindspring, etc. use the uu.net access numbers.
Uu.net will allow you to be connected indefinately. ELN will disconnect you
after 12 hours even if the connection is active (As opposed to idle.).)

If noone else jumped in, I would have won the fight easily. But when I
logged back in, I was nekkid in front of the soulbinder in Qeynos.

That sucked. Could have been prevented if I hadn't been dicking around.
Annoying that I probably died only because of link death. (I might have been
able to run if someone else jumped in and if things got hairy.) Humiliating
to get your ass handed to you by a wimpy corrupt Qeynos guard.
