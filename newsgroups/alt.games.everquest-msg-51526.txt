I was thinking lately about what common wisdom says are the 3 most soloable
classes in EQ:

1) Druid
2) Necro
3) Magician

...and I was wondering what most people would consider to be the 4th most
soloable class?  Shadowknight????  Or would that have changed in any way due
to the recent upgrading of the hybrid classes' combat tables?
