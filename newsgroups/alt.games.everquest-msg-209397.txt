I find that my wizard is well-wanted on raids, but not in groups.

People have an impression that wizards nuke themselves dry on one fight and
medd for the next two, or are constantly leaving for KEI.  I find it only
courteous to my groups if I get myself a fresh KEI before heading out, and
will often KEI my group as well if it's convenient (it's useful having a
chanter on the second account).  Any wizard worthy of the name can meter
their mana output to match the mana usage of the cleric, and thus contribute
to every fight without going oom.  Right now in an average group, I
contribute about four Ice Spears per mob (~1300 damage each with foci, for
~5200 damage) without dropping below 80 mana (on horseback, with KEI and
FT1).  I think that's reasonable as my 'share' of the damage for a
six-person group.  On the occasions (double pull, add, whatever) where the
group needs me to blow the manabar ( cleric shouts "Rhian, BURN THIS
FAST!!!"), I do so - and just let them know "Ok, I had to burn heavy on that
one, might have to sit one out."  Since this is both rare and requested by
the cleric, it's not an issue.
