I accept your use of "relatively" as pertainent. Problem is, by your measure
ID4 was one of the greatest movies ever made, the Ford Pinto is the one of
the best cars ever made, and I am sure you have heard the expression "Eat
shit, a million flies can't be wrong"

I happen to think there are other factors involved beyond the intelligence
of the designers that have been major contribitions to the game's success.
For one thing, I believe the orginal Diablo has now sold something like 2
million<1 for sure> copies which exposed a lot of new blood to the genre. EQ
and UO lucked out when they came out with persistant worlds on the heels of
Diablo. Didn't have anything to do with intelligence on their parts, just
right products at the right momment in time.

UO fumbled their position badly, leaving the door open for EQ. It wasn't so
much that VI was smart, it was that OSI was about as bright as rocks. It is
the Pinto vs the Buick Century when there was the oil embargo. A '72 Pinto
was looking awfully good when the competition was a 12 MPG gas guzzler.

Right now, EQ has several leads like stability, world size, customer
support, marketing. All of these things can be had for anyone with the will.
Just get a crack programming team, spend the money on hardware, use humans
for CS vs monkies, duplicate VI's marketing strategy. If they have the will
and a lot of game design savy, Sid Meir type, EQ could be vunerable.
