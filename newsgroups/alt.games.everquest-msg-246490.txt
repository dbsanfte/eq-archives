CS is still the occasional game for me, other old games include assorted
of the Civ series...CivI got played for well over 5 years though now I
play CivIII. Colonisation got the same

Xcom/UFO was a perennial drag out and try.

To be honest my upgrade to an XP box meant that a lot of these older games
I wanted to pull out ceased to run.
