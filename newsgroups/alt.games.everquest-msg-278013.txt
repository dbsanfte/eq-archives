Many many people have prepaid a year or six months, and have long since 
quit but will take quite some time to fall out of the active subscriber 
category. 

Plus There are -thousands- more who are playing WoW/EQ/etc and are 
logging into EQ half as often or a 3rd as often as they used to. Put 
another way:

50% of your playerbase quitting has the same effect on server population 
as 100% of your playerbase playing half as often, yet the latter won't 
even be a blip on the active subscriptions charts. 

The point I'm trying to make that the number of active subscriptions is 
not a very reliable indicator of actual server health.
