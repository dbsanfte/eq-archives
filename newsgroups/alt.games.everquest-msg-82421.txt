Personally I would work on getting higher wisdom items in certain slots so
that you can equip some resist gear all the time. For example, eboots or
coldain boots would be quite a bump, Aegis of life on your back would raise
wisdom, ac and poison resist I believe, ranged slot there a couple of opting
the teachers sylabus in the tower of frozen shoadow is nice, and there is a
new staff that goes into range slot that drops off the chieftian in
Hollowshade Moor, also in the tower the velium spiked helm is nice, gives
bumps to several stats but no wisdom (gives mana though), Kromiff military
leggings are nice to bump wisdom str and ac. All the items I mentioned can
be done with one or 2 friends. I try to get as much wisdom as possible so I
can keep more slots open for resist gear. You might try eqprices.com to sort
gear by resist stats and see which slot can give you more bang for the buck
so to speak. Good Luck
