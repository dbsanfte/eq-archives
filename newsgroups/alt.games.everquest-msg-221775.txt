You can't blame him. Like a fairly large number of people I spent some
time as a guide, in two stints, and even I don't know wtf the server
gm was doing most the time even when they were *online* which wasn't
really all that often.

Can't say the same for test server gms, though. They always seem to be
visibly busy. But then, they have nothing to do with CS.
