So you're saying that even if they gave you twice the number of memorizable 
spells, you wouldn't be happy?

Guess what - Playing a caster of most types requires a little bit of skill. 
Part of that skill is deciding which spells to mem. Whether it's 8 or 16 or 
32, it doesn't sound like you'd be happy unless you could cast any spell in 
your book at any time. Of course, let me guess, you also feel that you 
shouldn't be limited in what armor or weapons you use either?
