Yes.

At the same time you train the other ones.

All of them will eventually rise to 50;  only one can go above that.
The only thing you need to be careful about is making sure the one
you want is the one that hits 51 (and will then go higher.)  And, if
Specialize: Alteration is at 50 while you haven't trained the others,
it sounds like that's covered.  It will go over 50 and be set on one
of the first few spells you cast after putting a training point in
all the others.

The typical way to set specialization is to train them all, then just
practice (cast a low-level spell of the desired school repeatedly)
until it passes 50.  However, unless you're doing something unusual,
the specialization field that rises the quickest just in normal play
should be the one you want anyway.  The only thing to be careful about
is making sure you're playing normally.
