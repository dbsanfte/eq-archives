Sounded to me like he was talking about those that are targettable and 
attackable but invisible, making doing either a bit difficult. What I 
finally learned at one point was to immediately hit ESC to clear my target. 
Then the next time I got hit, the mob would be automatically targetted for 
me.

The biggest problems are the fact that a) you don't see them and therefore 
have no opportunity to avoid them unless you know where they are, and b) 
you have to get beat upon for several seconds before you manage to target 
them to fight back.

It can certainly make a dungeon..."interesting".
