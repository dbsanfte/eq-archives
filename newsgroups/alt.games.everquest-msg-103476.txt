No, I think he's wrong. (Not that I've ever played an SK..) Torrent
is the group version, scream buffs yourself only.

I don't know if this came up earlier:

Torrent of Hate
Decrease Attack (ATK) by 35 (L54)
Classes: Shd (L54)
Mana Required: 60
Spell Duration: 60 ticks (6.0 minutes)


Scream of Hate
Decrease Attack (ATK) by 8 (L15) and adds it to yours
Classes: Shd (L15)
Mana Required: 85
Spell Duration: 100 ticks (10.0 minutes)

So, if SoH is self-only, as I think it is, I'd say it's understandable
that you wonder about its high casting cost. Or ToH's low cost, maybe.

It's not mentioned, but ToH does give that ATK to your group.
I know, cause I've grouped a lot with shadow knights. Also,
I've never gotten SoH when grouping with lower SKs, even when
I've seen them cast it. So signs point to SoH being self-only.

(Rest snipped)
