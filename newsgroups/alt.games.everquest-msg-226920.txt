"/award" also has the problem that even if the loot distribution is 100%
fair, and the loot officer is 100% impartial, and perfect in every way...
it's still going to raise doubts and the appearance of impropriety
sometimes.

Borrowing your example a little...  Did the loot officer really award that
nice item to his wife because she attends every raid without fail and
without complaint, even though it's her second nice item in the week...  or
did he just give it to her because he doesn't want to sleep on the couch?
Or was it a combination of attendance and that one of his old buddies
mistakenly thinks you trained them in Sebilis 2 months ago...

Even if it's completely fair much Guild Drama is often the result.
