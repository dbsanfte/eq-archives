yeah, but so was AO and honestly AO did.

The problem is that AO turned out to be much less of  a game 
once you got past the bugs. I was totally addicted to EQ, I never
was to AO. I've not even logged into AO for like a week or more since
its kinda pointless to do so. 

It doesn't matter if you improve problems like camping or downtime
if you have less of a game. AO showed me something, I wanted more
randomness and anti downtime things and autogenerated soloable
quest content like in AO, but I really wanted them in EQ. Having every
thing you want but in a game that really makes you not want to bother
is pointless.
