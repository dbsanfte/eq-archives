My estimation has been that there's a min and maximum 5% failure and
success rates, with each skill difference from trivial being a % chance
of failure.  So using your example at 180 skill trying to do a 240
trivial your success chance would be about 40%.  If you are within 5
skill points of being trivial your success chance isn't going to get any
better at 95%. My experience is that this estimation is somewhat off and
the formula is a bit more complicated than that, but it seems to be
close enough for a quick estimation.
