This really doesn't apply to the subject matter, but I thought it was funny
when it happened. And it's kinda relevant.

I'm sitting in WC waiting for daybreak so I can run through Kithikor.
Someone runs up to me (I think he was a half-elf, it's been awhile since
this happened.), and says something in a foreign language. I wasn't sure
what he said, or if he was talking to me, so I ignored him and just sat
there clicking the "time" button. Then he runs up in front of me and says it
again. Having enough Puerto Rican friends, I recgonized it this time as
Spanish. So, I said "Sorry, I don't understand, I don't speak Spanish".

He hesitated, then said his statement again. So, I said "No habla Espanol"
He then fired off a long sentence, of which the only words I recgonized were
the last three "no habla espanol?" I said "Si". He says "oooh" and runs off.
A few seconds later, he comes back and says "Parle Vou Francoi?" I said "No,
I'm sorry, I can only speak English." He says "No Francoi?" I say "No, only
English." Again, he says "oooh" and runs off. A moment later, he comes back,
saying something in a third language, one I did not recgonize at all. (wild
guess would have been Dutch) So, I say once more "I'm sorry, I don't
understand, I can only speak English." He then said something else in that
same language, the only word I caught was "no". So, hoping he was asking me
"you can't speak this language?" I said "Si". As he stood there, I came up
with an idea that might work. I said "I'm an American, I only know English."
He says, "Americano?" I say "Si, Americano". Once again he says "oooh", then
turns to leave. He turns back and says "You know, I really need to brush up
on my English lessons." He then waved, ran off and I never heard from him
again.
