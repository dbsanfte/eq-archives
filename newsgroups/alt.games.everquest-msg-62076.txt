Is there somewhere on the net that I can go to to find out which god(s) goes
with which race/class combo?

The only one I know for sure is that Human and Half-elf druids can be either
Karana or Tunare.

If it says where the starting city is that would be great but I'm more
interested in the combos.  I searched allakazam and everlore but either it
doesn't exist on those or I'm searching for the wrong keywords.

I guess I could go to the create screen and create each combo but I'm a lazy
ass and I don't really care that much. ;-)

Also, I wouldn't mind just reading up about the different gods.  I read a
website once that had some good stuff but don't remember which that was.

Thanks,

Lewis
