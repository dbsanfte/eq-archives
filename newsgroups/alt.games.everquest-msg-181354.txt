If you are nearly dead when you zone (I can't remember how it works - 
either "you would be dead without those buffs on you" or "you would be 
dead without your armor") it'll strip your buffs and throw you to your 
bind point instead of killing you.  Not so fun when you lose KEI or aego 
or something, but better than losing them and exp.
