Lies!

Our guild killed Emp last night, despite several folks getting stuck in 
the walls and even the CEILING. More than one person was grav-fluxed by 
the general on the way to the Emp so that all you could see were little 
feet sticking out of the ceiling. The mobs themselves were often knocked 
into the wall where they couldn't be hit.

Instead of cornering the emp, we had to waltz him in circles in the 
middle of his room.

And I simply could not get out of the swim-up tube shrunk.
