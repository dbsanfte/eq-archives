I'm trying to keep myself and my husband entertained while we camp
Stormfeather.  Yeah, I know...barely 2 weeks back into EQ and we're
camping Stormfeather.  I was excited about being part of a four-some
taking down Lodi (my first lodi kill!) two nights ago, and double excited
that both hubby and I got our map pieces, but at this point I wish I'd
never seen Lodi and let myself think I could somehow get my eyepatch.  
Argh, anyhow.  Getting off track there

1) Run 3...I understand this is not quite as fast as SoW.  ARe there any
sow-ing classes among you, however, that just forgo SoW due to having
run3?  The idea of the extra spell-slot/buff-slot when hunting is really
really enticing.  

2) Punishing Blade - yes, I got myself an amygdalan war staff (woot!!) for
a mere 4k from a game friend, so I'm a little terror with a big stick now.  
I'd love any AAs that make me more of a terror. To those who chose this
one...did you notice any real increase in DPS?  I'll probably be around 61
for a while, so I won't be able to put more than one level into it for a
while. Oh, and PoP AAs...if they say "no prereqs", does it really mean I
can choose it before I'm done with even Tier 1 AAs?

3) Headshot - Do mobs killed with this leave a corpse?  What is the chance
of it activating on a given mob? Cuz with my fear of being KSed while
doing stormy, I'm thinking I want Headshot before I camp him a second time
(this round is for my husband).  I have no intentions of doing EQ/AM3
anytime soon...just a roleplay preference...so I see this as one way I can
safeguard myself against being KSed.

Altogether now...STORMFEATHER IS EVIL!!!
