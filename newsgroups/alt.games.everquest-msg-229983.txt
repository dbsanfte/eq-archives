Ah, back home and back into trolling the newsgroups full-time.  It feels
good.

Nothing wrong with that.  =)  Not the most mana-efficient method, of course,
but if you have KEI and enough mana left over to nuke, then you're obviously
doing all right.

A lot of people try to cut things too close with Complete Heal ("Gonna get
you to join my Purple Club tonight, Main_Tank!").  Mostly, though, it's
Divided Attention Span Theater, where clerics are watching TV instead of a
tank's health bar and then try to catch up later.

I admit that I do lots of spell-swapping.  That's where having a mount is
very useful, since you can swap spells and not get sitting aggro.  Also, the
patch that allowed you to right-click and choose from a drop-down menu a
spell to put into an empty gem was a godsend for me.  Right-click gem to
empty it, then right-click again to choose a new spell to put into its
place, and bingo-bango-bongo I'm in business.

It all comes down to playing style, really.  You take a very active role in
your groups (pulling, CC, *and* nuking *and* stunning!), I think because
your groups tend to be small (3-4 people).  I tend to only group in full
groups, and there's almost always someone who can pull/CC/stun/nuke better
than I can.  You've had to play a variety of roles as a result, and are
usually in a situation where you simply *can't* slack or everyone will die.
It's made you a better cleric in most aspects.  There are some adjustments
you're gonna have to make as you approach 65, but I'm confident you can make
them.  =)

Short story time:  I never ever used DA until I was in my 50's.  Then I went
to a Hate Raid and died eight times (after the break-in).  Those mobs hit
hard and it seemed like whenever I healed the Main Tank, down I'd go.  It
was only afterwards that a tank asked me why I wasn't using DA.  I made the
adjustment and never had a similar problem again.

The moral is:  you can get by just fine without DA until your 50's, and you
can very quickly learn how to use it.

So perhaps my finger-shaking at you was a bit of an overreaction.  =)

As an aside, if you're in a full group with good DPS, drop the nukes.  Our
nukes aren't totally bad but they take a looong time to cast and a looong
time to refresh.  If you're in a full group, you won't be able to get off
more than one or two casts before the mob is dead.  So you can easily give
that up and your group's DPS won't noticeably suffer.

The stuns and pacify are also easy to dump because usually you can either
find someone who's better at casting those things or learn to live around
them.

One cleric should be all the healing a group ever needs.

I'm stunned speechless.  I can understand why such a proclamation would make
Lenny nervous.
