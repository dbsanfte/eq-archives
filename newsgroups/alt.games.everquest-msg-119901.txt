I spoke too soon about having GM's when needed. It seems for the last week
at least they decided having a GM on at all times on Stormhammer is a waste
of time so they are back to normal trading hours. Bugger - that was the
whole reason I played on Stormhammer - actually having a chance at a GM when
needed during my spanked timezone and the fact that there was no "free jerk
time".

I asked the GM Parmina in the chat channel what the go was and she replied
they had been moved to day shift but would not answer when that started : |

What is the purpose of the night GM in the chat channel anyway? It took ages
to answer a very simple questions whislt she was sitting back having a good
old jaw to her buddies about music bands and her alts? My curiousity piqued,
I stayed in chat for hours and this seemed to be normal methodology. She
ended up advising 3 seperate people they would need to page a GM ingame
though, knowing full well there were no ingame GM's at the time.

I would have been rather irate getting that advice. If no GM's are on the
players server wouldn't it be better just to say "take a rest for a while,
no GM's on at the moment, try again in 3 hours when they start again" rather
than send someone blindly back into the game to wait fruitlessly for hours?

Anyway - Eventually Parmina's shift ended and the replacement GM let me know
4 GM's had already started shift on Stormhammer. Once I went back in the GM
who answered the page was polite and completely proffessional though. It is
amazing the difference in attitude after experiencing the cultivated disdain
earlier on.
