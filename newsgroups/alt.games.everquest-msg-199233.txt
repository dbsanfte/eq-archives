No, I'm not kidding.  And yes, I think I just did.

Nope, I'm still resisting that one.  :-p
Also, spelling isn't quite the same thing as usage (usually, anyway).

Damn, you're not usually this touchy with anyone except Rumble.  Since
you snipped "the joke", I went ahead and snipped my opinion of it.  I
think I'll snip some more too, just to get to the part about the
frenchmen.  (And I snipped a snide remark I made above too, and... )

No sir, that is most definitely NOT what I am doing.  It's not an
issue of "an idea widely believed to be true", but rather "a symbol
widely recognized as referring to an idea".  Language is a matter
of common consent.  If, for example, forty million frenchmen agree
that "s'il vous plait" means "if you please", then that is what it
means (to them).

Here's an example from RL:  A century or so ago the U.S. goverment
started referring to combat deaths by the euphemism "casualties"
(iirc, it was during the Spanish American War).  The insurance
companies complained to no avail, and in a fairly short period of
time "casualty" had acquired a new meaning that was far different
from "accidental loss" (it's hardly an accident when you kill
somebody by deliberately dropping an artillery shell on them).

Common usage is how living languages change.  I, and as far as I can
tell many others, have given up the struggle over "donations" in EQ.
You are, of course, free to continue the battle.  But frankly I see
no intrinsic merit to your stubbornness, pissing into the wind is just
not a sensible thing to do, imo.
