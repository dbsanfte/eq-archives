You can start earlier, i started at level 16... using root instead of snare
on 4 mobs if u got the mana for it. Ofcourse this is not real quadding, but
its nuking down 4 mobs at once so in a sense quadding. But its not until you
get BoF andd CoF that a wizards quadding career starts to take off for
real.. and CoF is a lvl 34 spell.
