Neither druids nor bards can do any sort of sort, or turn off various cons.
Druids and bards can turn off player tracking.  Druids and bards will always
get mobs on tracking in the order they spawn (newest spawns at the top)
which is nigh useless.

The range of your tracking is directly proportional to your tracking skill.
Druids and bards both top out their tracking skill at a fraction of a
ranger's skill.   My bard's tracking is shorter than my ranger's bowshot
range!  (Shissar bow, class 3 bone arrows.)  And the ranger has longer-range
tracking despite the level difference.  (Ranger is 27, bard is 51.)

That being said, playing a Druid is probably closest to your necro in terms
of style (snare, fear, dot, rot, etc.)  If you want to mix it up in melee
more, try the Ranger.  If you want something TOTALLY different from your
necro, do the bard - it's totally different compared to anything else in the
game!  Be aware, though, that in player polls Bard and Enchanter were
consistently listed as the two hardest classes to play, and Druid and Necro
the two easiest.  Ranger was somewhere in the middle.
