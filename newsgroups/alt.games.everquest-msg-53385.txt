In a nutshell, here's how it works.  There is some constant, call it
C, based on your race (C is not really constant...it changes a few
times at higher levels...but no need to worry about that now).  To get
to the end of level L, you need a total of CL^3 experience.

So, to get to the end of level 4, you need 64C experience.  To get to
the end of 5, you needed 125C experience.  Note that the difference,
61C is almost as much as it took to get to the end of 4.  In other
words, getting through level 5 requires almost as much experience as
getting from 1 to 5.  If all other things were equal, then, 5 would
indeed seem to take forever compared to previous levels.  Getting to
the end of 3 required 27C, so getting through 4 was 37C, compared to
61C to get through 5.  So, looked at that way, 5 is about 50% harder
than 4.

However, things are not equal.  There is another factor at work.
Monsters have levels, too.  Fire Beetles, for example, are always
level 2.  When you were level 1, the conned yellow to you.  When you
were level 2, they conned even.  They were blue at 3, and I think 4
and 5, and are green at 6+.

The experience you get from killing a level M monster that is blue,
black/white, yellow, or red to you is ZM^2, where Z is a constant for
the zone (if you've heard that a zone has an XP bonus, what that means
is that Z is higher in that zone than average).

When a monster is green to you, the XP depends on how green it is.  If
it is one level below blue, you get ZM^2/2.  If it is two levels below
blue, you get ZM^2/4.  If it is any lower than that, you get no
experience.

The monsters in West Freeport would have mostly been green by one
level to you at 5.  So, 5 took a long time because (1) you need 50%
more XP to get from 5 to 6 than you needed to get from 4 to 5, and (2)
many of the mobs you killed were having their XP yield cut in half for
being green.  Combine these, and 5 to 6 probably took twice as many
kills as 4 to 5.

Oh, there might be another factor, too.  You play a Magician, so I
presume you are using a pet?  When you and the pet kill something,
some of the XP is allocated to the pet (where it does no good).  I
don't recall the formula, but I *think* that if the pet does the
majority of the damage, it takes something like half the XP.  When
fighting monsters closer to your level, it takes the pet a while to
kill the thing, and you've got time to do a lot of damage.  If you are
fighting level 1 green monsters, though, the pet might take them down
so quickly that you have trouble doing half damage.  This could add
another factor of 2 in the number of fights you needed to get from 5
to 6.  (That would be partly mitigated be lower down time, though, if
you were just sitting back and letting the pet do the work).
