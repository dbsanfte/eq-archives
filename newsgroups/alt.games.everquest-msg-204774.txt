*shudder* a word of caution...I practiced my fishing this weekend in
Gunthak while I waited to go gather quest items for spells, and I had the
oddest thing happen to me.  I bumped into an "invisible zone wall" in
gunthak (it seems to prevent you from going into the water on one side of
the lighthouse), so I decided to put myself on auto-run, pick up a book,
and wait for my swimming to go up.  Next time I looked up, I had somehow
passed through the zone all, and was trapped in this no-mans-land on the
other side of the lighthouse.  Spent an hour trying to find a way back,
but eventuallyused up one of my FoB port potions.

Very disturbing...I don't think I'll ever auto-swim into a rock anymore.
