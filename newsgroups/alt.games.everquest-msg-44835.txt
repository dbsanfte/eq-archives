Groovy, while I can commend your concern i must contend that you are
oversimplifying a complex situation.  Crowded (a.k.a. popular) zones are
that way because of ease of access and hunting opportunities.  Where do
you suppose an Iksar is going to hunt at levels 20-25?  LOIO or per your
suggestion, Warrens?  Let's not forget to mention that half the world's
population cannot even get to Odus without a port.  Granted, offering 10pp
for a port is a pittance to many, but this becomes a serious drain to
anyone who must bank on another continent.  Banking in Paineel?  My Iksar
monk, a Thulian himself, has killed enough kobolds to be a walking
Auschwitz and still doesnt have enough faction to get a key.  Ask for
newbie Heretics to open the way for me?  And risk getting stuck in Paineel
for a few hours?  Niggaplease!  A few others have already mentioned
Verant's hardon for green aggro so I won't even go there.

Here's a new zone idea I'd like to see:  let's say the Orc Highway in
Oasis actually went somewhere...  What do we have here?  A lvl 25-40 zone
called the Deathfist Hills, lair of that pesky Clan of Deathfist Orcs.
They sit around in their hills plotting evil and Deathfisting each other
in their leisure time.  I'll go there.  Easy access to FP and
Oggok/Grobb.  Also, any children of Ik fresh off the boat have quick
access.

Nothing personal, Chef, but you really need to examine your post from a
few more perspectives before presenting it to people who didnt just fall
off the EQ turnip truck.
