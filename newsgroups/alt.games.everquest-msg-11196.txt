Here's a way they could get the old zones converted, and make some more
money off them from a new market segment.

Release a new varient of EQ.  EverQuest: Arena.  This would be an add-on
to EQ that provides a mini-server that supports PvP combat, but no NPCs
or mobs, and just a subset of existing items.  With EQ: Arena, you
basically get to play a Quake-like game, but using EQ characters and
spells and weapons, and EQ zones.  Like Quake, you could play on your
LAN running your own server, or find a game on the internet.  Verant
would not run any mini-servers.

Also release some zone building tools, so people can make their own PvP
zones for EQ: Arena.

A lot of EQ players seem to like to duel now and then, or visit arenas
for some friendly PvP (note how most guild meetings seem to be held in
arenas, so people can play around with PvP afterwards).  I think a lot
of people would like EverQuest: Arena.

How does this relate to this thread?  If they did this, pretty quickly
after they released the zone building tools and the documentation on the
file formats, I'm sure there would be people making upgraded versions of
the old zones for PvP use.  If Verant did the licensing right, they
would then be able to pick up those zones and use them for Luclin.

In other words, do like Quake, and get the players to do the work. :-)
