From the shadows, the mysterious Foxeye Vaeltaja
<jnparker@EEKSPAM.mtholyoke.edu> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

That the email account - or at least what you typed in as the email
account - isn't active. Are you sure its not a typo?

That he's DEAD? He's on a ship, right? No one on the ships is getting
killed. I don't think you need to worry.

If he were a marine or a navy pilot it might be a different story. I
still don't think they would delete an email account within hours of
someone dying....
