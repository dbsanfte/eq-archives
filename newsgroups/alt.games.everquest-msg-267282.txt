You need The Caves !

Go to a pier, and you'll see a bell, for transport within Qeynos.
There's a second bell nearby, that will take you outside Qeynos, to
The Caves, Antonica and OAkmyst Forest.

Kill creatures and you'll randomly get awarded coins.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
