 Those essence items don't seem that great for what it takes to get
them. I don't think it's worth a rather rare scale PLUS your Sleepers
Tomb key unless Melafin gives you your ST key back. Sure, I'd love a
weapon with an 80pt lifetap but it's not like getting a Sleepers key is
a walk in the park.

 Not that great of a ranged item, really, for the effort involved. 

>Primal still drops also, but only from a couple harder mobs I guess.

 Drops from Master of the Guard, Progenitor and Final Arbitor but it's
rare. You'd be lucky to have one of the three drop a primal on any one
clearing. From what we've seen it's probably one primal every two
clearings.

 Ring of Superiority is fairly comparable. You'd see one of those before
you see a Sleepers Key+Prismatic scale in my opinion.

>Gad the essence pearl earring is nuts too...

 It's not bad. Earring of the Icecaster from Jorlleag is fairly
comparable to that.

 I'm not saying that the essence items aren't nice. They obviously are.
It just seems more like a bone thrown to those people who got to
Sleepers Tomb just a little late.
