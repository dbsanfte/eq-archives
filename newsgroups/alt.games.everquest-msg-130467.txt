So how do I get up there to begin with?  That's my general question.  Why
can I get way up out of harm's reach and other times I can't?  It seems
random to me, but just wondering.  Could it be my system?  I've run from the
tunnel in DL to the area near Karnor's several times in group runs, and had
people comment on how high I was.  The last time I helped a warrior get from
the tunnel to FV zone (he was a chicken) we both got so high that we
couldn't see the ground.  Then we got sucked into what I think is the
"blank" of Karnors in DL and a GM had to summon us out, but that's another
story hehe.
Anyhow, the point is why can I get ridiculously high at some times?  Do any
of you people have the same thing happen to you?
