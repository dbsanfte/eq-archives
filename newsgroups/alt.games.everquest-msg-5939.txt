What I've found is that people are usually appreciative, and say thanks. I've also found myself to be the benificiary of someone's helpful
spell, but didn't notice it right away, due to trying to avoid a CR.  When I looked around after the battle, the person was gone.  Of
course, I could back-scroll and tell them;  sometimes, though, they'd logged.

As with some of the other posts here, it's fun to simply run around the zone SOWing and healing from time to time.  Also, my ogre picks up
plenty of low-quality armor in the newbie zone - I always save it in a "charity" backpack to help out the 1-4 newbies.  They're usually
_extremely_ grateful.  I'll admit it, I'm a "gratitude whore".  Hehe.
