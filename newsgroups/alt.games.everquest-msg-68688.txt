<shrug>  I heard a few on my server tell me not to use it (some of those who
used it on a regular basis) telling me that some that they knew (I know,
hearsay, but, I trust them) were getting the boot because of using it, or
atleast that was the reason they think they got booted.. who knows, they
MIGHT have been poking where they shouldn't have been poking.. I just
honestly dont know and dont care to find out. <grin>

I dont care to run it unless I get four more accounts (which will never
happen even in my wildest of dreams) so I can have a full group of my own on
one computer. <grin>  Would be interesting to say they least, but, 6 copies
of EQ running.. welllll.. just seems there would be a bit of slow down,
errm, after three instances..

Dunno Dan.. your guess is as good as mine.. but, honestly, I would hate to
find out the hard way.. and well, calling them to find out.. LOL.. we all
know how phone calls to them go.. ;p
