Bah! Kicked out of the Bazaar again...
Oh well, I imagine all my Velium has sold by now, anyway. No one seems to
want any of my other stuff
Cobalt Gaunts, Loam encrusted Amice, Mighty Earthen Gauntlets...just no
takers, they just buy the Velium :ï¿½)

Incidently, was there a patch of any sort last night (after 3am BST so 7pm
PST) woke up to see myself at Desktop...which was odd, still connected to
net so PC hadn't crashed and rebooted and normally if the server or my ISP
plays up I'll be at Server screen or Options screen. Hell I can't even camp
to desktop, on that PC, when I want to.
