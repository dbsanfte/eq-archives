I say jump right in. There is more content for and they cater more to the 
new player now than ever before.

It is true that you will encounter a lot of players your level with 
awesome gear compared to anything you may have, as they have been twinked 
from their high-level main characters, but honestly that doesn't make 
your game any worse. As a matter of fact, I have started new characters 
on new servers just to have to begin with absolutely nothing for a 
refreshing change. It's not that hard to work your way up to being well-
equipped for your level.

I would just suggest starting on one of the newer servers, Maelyn 
Starpyre, Stromm, Tholuxe Paells (there may be a couple others that are 
also a good idea). That way you might run into a lower level demographic 
that is truly lower level. Firiona Vie is also a good choice. It is a 
role-playing-encouraged (though not a lot of it really goes on) server 
with a limit of one character per account. The only people twinking lower 
level characters there are those with multiple accounts or those who 
decide that starting a new character is worth deleting their higher level 
established character to do so.

Good luck and have fun!
