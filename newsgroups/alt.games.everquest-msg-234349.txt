Snip, In regards to Talking about camping the Rallic Pack:

>Sells pretty fast, but only for 500-800 or so.

That is true, but if you are a druid and just running around its
something you can check fairly fast. You can also get extra component
drops of the items you need to make it, when bored, possibly selling
off some of them. Or actually they might be so cheap in the bazaar
that its not even worth camping the parts, I've not checked on the
High quality owlbear hide lately or what not.
I always think of the Rallic pack as free money, basically, for the
time I invested.

The ethereal warhammer, you mentioned as not being that great either.
This is also true, but its also quite fast for a druid to get around
level 55. Meanwhile, the mob for the Long sword of Eth. En. was always
camped before they nerfed the quest ;) I've never had the mobs for the
warhammer camped when I ran by and did the quest for the heck of it.


>As someone said, there is no "easy way" to making pp fast.

True. The people the best at doing it have several people they do it
with. There isn't a whole lot you can do alone for good plat drops,
especially anymore. I've always wondered if I had the full range of
"good" group classes, bothering to get them to around level 65, then
running 4 people on two computers (with two EQwindows instances on
both), If I'd be able to camp some of the really great stuff. But
really I've never cared that much about EQ to bother to do this, or
pay SOE that amount of money.

Yeah. Tradeskill items are good. I like when I find a bunch of drops
on NPC vendors, that is when you really clean up. I always wonder who
the newbies are selling the High quallity bear skins to a vendor, or
the 85 spiderling silks.

I kind of forgot about that, when bored I used to log on and make a
circuit of some vendor npcs around freeport, neriak and Qeynos (once
POK was in it was easy for my dark elf cleric to do this, who was
beloved around qeynos and freeport by then.) Even taking an hour I'd
have enough to make around 600 plat that night in the bazaar, while I
was asleep in real life.
