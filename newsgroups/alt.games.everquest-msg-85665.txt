It doesn't presonally affect me, but doesn't it seem like multi
questing items is a blantant and rather serious exploit of the quest
engine?

What is MQ?  Well you and a buddy each have a no drop piece for a
quest. He turns his in first, you turn yours in second, completing the
quest and you get the item.  It works brilliantly.

However, doesn't this defeat the purpose of having the items no drop
in the first place? 

Its no big deal if its done amoungst friends, but its starting to get
bad, stick around Bazzar or NFP long enough and you will see some jerk
auctioning to sell MQ of some high end, sometimes EPIC item.   Its an
embarrasment to the quest engine.

I'm no psychic, but I see in the future some warnings about MQing
being warnable, which it should be.
