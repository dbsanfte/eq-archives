Just about two months ago I started my first monk and I have had so much
fun playing him.  I have neglected my other characters, I like him so much.
Part of the reason I like him is his difference from other characters.  He's
not a caster, but he doesn't require brute strength to steamroll opponents.
He avoids the baddies' blows.  His mind controls his body enough to make
it seem he's dead when he's not, and when that's saved his skin he jumps
up and mixes it up again.  He also dishes it out fairly well.

Another reason I like him is because I play sporadically enough that I solo,
and early in his life a kind druid practicing her tailoring made a gift of Wu's
to me, so I've had an easy childhood and teenage years.  Now I'm 22 and I
float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.  If there's an NPC named
Mohammed Ali, I hope he's a monk.

Now I read that monks get clobbered much worse.  I understand the intent
to do this is to mitigate an imbalance in the amount of damage we can
take, in particular as compared to warriors.  I am just personally
disappointed because I don't play regularly enough to establish a group of
people with whom to play as a team, and it seems this will hamper monks'
solo abilities quite a bit.

I'll have to try him now.  I hope the change is more noticeable at higher
levels, as I see many comments here from high-level monks criticizing the
change.  Then again, having been made a gift of the armor I've gotten, I
still am charmed.  I love my monk and will play him even if light blues are
all I can solo any more.

        in the first person)
