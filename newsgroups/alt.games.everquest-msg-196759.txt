Ah! I've heard of that game. You still have to have Halflife though, right?

I'm more into RPGs myself. A couple of my friends play shooters though.
They've been hooked on Battlefield 1942. I found them a mod for that one
called Desert Combat. It's pretty cool. It updates everything to put it in a
modern setting. The weapons and vehicles are all changed to weapons used
now. They even added mortars, something the original game didn't have.
