I was a bard - I didn't give it up because of my hands, but because
of ISP problems followed by the nerfing of pixie strike and a severely
bad taste in my mouth.

We had this self same discussion on the eqbards mailing list (you can
find it at http://www.onelist.com  search for eqbards)  IIRC the general
consensus was we *LIKED* the fact that being a good bard required skill
and concentration.  I certainly did.  If I was still playing I'd 
be completely opposed to automated twisting (as it is, I don't think
it's a good idea).  With automated twisting, anyone - I mean *ANYONE*
could simply set up a selo's/chant/chant twist and run all over a
zone killing anything they could stick the chants on.  ZERO skill 
involved (beyond staying in range of the mobs - run tight enough circles
though).  Automated twists means bard bots with ae resist/regen songs
being standard for any raiding force.  Gods, leave us one class where
the person actually has to be sitting behind the keyboard paying attention.
