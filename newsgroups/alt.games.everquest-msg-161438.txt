Wow thats flat out wrong, sounds like people that have never played the
game, talking out of their assholes.  Neocron brings a whole new dimension
to the genre, everything from clan warfare, faction zone ownership, to the
gritty adult themes, and balanced PvP aspects..  Let alone this guy is
fucking clueless in that Neocron is FPS-MMORPG, and is the first one to hit
the market..  Its not turn-based ubercrap like DAOC and the others...  A
game where your SKILLS make you win...

Yes, you can probably find SOMEONE to talk bad about the game, usually
someone that hasn't played it, or someone that played it early beta..  But
the fact is, there are very very few negative discussions about it -
compared to EQ or AC/DAOC forums...  Overall, its 90%+ positive talk.

Frankly, the game kicks the shit out of anything out there, and is just what
the doctor ordered to cure the boring shit-mmorpg's we've all been playing
for the last couple years.
