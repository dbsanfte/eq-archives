I can't swear to it but if I am right your wizzy won't have to worry about
running around in fear Ragefire will summon him. Like I said I can't swear
to Ragefire summoning all I remember about the incident that happen to me
was soloing Wyvern and such in Skyfire while medding fully buffed a Big
Dragon was being raided. I was above the Druid ring when the next thing I
know was summoned being in Form of the Howler I tried to make a run for it
when I was  summoned again. Loading .....returning to bind point.
I sat there for about an Hour and a half hoping for a rez before logging for
the night  afraid to try and port in with a Cleric. Don't know who killed me
but I didn't last long at all he slapped me around like last years doggie
toy.
