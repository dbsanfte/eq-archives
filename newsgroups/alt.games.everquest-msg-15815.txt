TRPG is fun, at first.  But, the very limited dungeons and gameplay starts to show quickly.
There really is no comparison: 2-12 people online, at most, on each server, limited items,
limited Mobs to hunt, a few quests, but not much.  Also, expect to see more than a few of the
admin's buddies all with level 50+ characters, which can be disheartening when you are trying to
bust your hump to get level 3. The interface isn't exactly RPG friendly, either.

It's fun, something amusing to do, but not in the same league as EQ.  I have to give a LOT of
credit to those who work on this, it is a monumental effort at creating something entirely new
with Tribes.  Generally, if I don't have the patience to play a session of EQ, I fire up either
Tribes or Tribes2 and look for an UltraRenegades3 server.
