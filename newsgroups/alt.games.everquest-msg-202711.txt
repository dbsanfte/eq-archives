Actually, they believe quite the opposite.   Whether it is out of friendship
and wanting to spend time with others, or loyalty ("If my cleric quits, my
friends wont' be able to play...") many, many people continue to play (and
pay the monthly fees to do so) long past the point where they have
personally lost interest in the game.      I know there were definitely
times where the "personal achievements" of EQ fell completely short for me
personally, yet I continued to play because I didn't want to abandon my
friends.  We played as a group, and we quit as a group, once the majority of
us would rather be somewhere else than on EQ.

By forcing grouping, Sony hopes that they are forcing you also to make
ingame friends, which will aid thier long term retention more than a few
individual soloists playing a little bit longer.
