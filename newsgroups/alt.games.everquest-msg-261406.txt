Overthere at the SF ramp is a classic spot, where just about any soloer 
or group can find sufficient killable mobs to keep them busy for as long 
as they want to camp, yet avoid annoying adds that might otherwise 
overwhelm them; additionally its the easiest spot to find a group or to 
find more group members.

Personally, I'm not a huge fan, as the loot is poor and the exp isn't 
very good per kill, but I can certainly see the attraction, and have in 
fact spent many levels there on one character or another; primarily 
because I wanted a place where I could start working out how that 
particular character works in a group, and as I said, getting group is 
easy there.

My preference, though, if you already have the group you want ready to 
go, would be to go somewhere else, where you can get more cash or more 
exp, or at a minimum something more interesting than a constant stream 
of sarnak cactus tiger cockatrice rhino.

One example would be the Gulf of Gunthak; like OT there's a POK stone to 
get you there, but you'll find both the cash and the exp to be much 
better than in OT.  On the beach none of the mobs roam and all are 
single pullable with a little care, the undead don't run when low on hp 
which is nice if you can't snare (say the beastlord and magician are on 
but the necro isn't) the live mobs do, which is nice if you can.  Level 
up a bit and move into the tunnel, which has higher level mobs, and into 
the towns which have still other mobs and even some named that pop now 
and then.
