There's some weirdness around dispelling mobs, but 95% of the times I get
dispelled it takes my top buffs.  The other 5% probably corresponds to those
times when I zone and "/gui Hey, why did my buff order change?"
Particularly since in such cases it will be the same slot that ends up
getting dispelled over and over.
