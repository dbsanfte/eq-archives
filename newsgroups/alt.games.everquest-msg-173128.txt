At low levels, the "specialties" of each class
are so weak that there's not much difference between,
say, a spellcaster and a melee class.  Everyone's
just weakly poking monsters with their rusty daggers.

But at 20+, each class begins to "come into their own",
as their class-defining abilities grow in power and
begin to truly differentiate them from the other classes.

And the differences continue to grow, so that by
the top levels, for example, a level 60 Druid is so
vastly different from a level 60 Paladin that playing
each is in many ways almost like playing different games
entirely -- like playing a battlefield game from as
a tank commander, versus the pilot of a fighter jet.
