I can't imagine a piece of equipment or spell for a 65 shaman that would sell
for less than 8.5kpp (cheapest mount, more or less) that would be worth
giving up medding all the time.   Of course you aren't suffering with the
tiny canni chunks, you can take big Canni V gulps... at 51 my shaman is
chewing canni about 85% of his operating time, so the mount is a huge bonus
to his mana flow.  But if you are saying you needed every scrap of mana for
the general, well then it sounds like you'd still have benefitted from a
mount in at least a 8.5kpp kind of way.

I"m certain my 65 cleric has no better piece of gear than his 8.5kpp pony,
although on odd numbered days I'd say the same about his epic.. just depends
on how many dead people I saw that day and whether I was indoors or not.
