No. Breaking a contract isn't against the law. There is no law that says 
contracts may not be broken.

However, there is a law that essentially says that if a contract is 
broken, the damaged parties have an option to sue for damages.

Its completely different.

If it were speeding....

Its the difference between it being illegal to speed, and it being 
perfectly legal to speed, but with a law in place so that if someone is 
injured because you were speeding they can sue you for damages.

Totally different!
