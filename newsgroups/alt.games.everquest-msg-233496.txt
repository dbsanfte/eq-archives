This is very hit or miss. A guild on our server had their instance hosed
for 22 days straight and dispite actually getting a gm_admin to answer
their petition they were unable to get a fix.

VZ is all about the MT. He has to be totally on the ball at all times
and pop out of fd mode instantly to keep agro. Pets can help a bit by
taking a few hits while he gets back up. An unlucky crit nuke hitting
the instant fd hits can really wreck your day.

You might want to work on TZ and VZ before knocking down the easy TT and
Saryn to maximize your time in phase 4. We still do it that way even
after clearing to Quarm multiple times.
