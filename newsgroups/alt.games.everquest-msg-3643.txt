I agree, the common wisdom is that clerical melee damage output
is a pittance... but I put it to you that common wisdom is not
always correct.  The character that I originally worked on this
with didn't -start- doing it till the late 30's, and observation shows
that I was literally outdamaging many tanks in my groups up into
the mid 40s.  Assume, for the sake of arguement that you could
add another tank to your group for damage production, without
it costing you a cleric, or any more exp.  Would you be better
off or no?  The smaller the group the more this works, by the way,
in a 6 man tank heavy group I rarely do it, the contribution I'm
putting in -isn't- all that much proportionally, and in a large group
I've got a lot more to worry about than damage output.

If you read the thread closely, I deal with this issue.  Yep, you
can end up getting smacked for doing it.  Takes some care.  Also
helps that I'm playing clerics doing it, so my AC isn't something
to sneeze at like your Druid AC level.  There are times when I
do this in an -effort- to get the attention, so I can back off and
root park or (assuming I'm sow'd) Kite park... but by and large,
no, since I'm not taunting and the real tanks are, and since I'm
swinging only occaisionally while the other tanks are using light
fast weapons that swing a -lot-, I don't actually invite as much
attention as you would think.

SInce I've been doing this recently at low levels, I can provide
specific examples there: between 10th and 13th levels, I've
been doing up to 19 points of damage per swing cycle with
a runed totem staff.  Due to misses and partial damage swings,
I'm averaging 11 points per swing cycle.  In this time, the
average damage my group mates are putting out also hovers
around that level, situation after situation.  More specifically,
teamed with a bard at level 13 today, I was doing an average
of 13 points per cycle (thanks to his song buffs boosting my
combat ability, presumably) while he was averaging less than
10, and the 14 warrior in the group was averaging 12.  The
other cleric in my group sat constantly, we both did about the
same amount of buffing and healing (since we had hotkey
macro's announcing heals and discussed who would buff who)
and we both had similar mana flow.  Which cleric was
more effective?

Now I know that in the teens a cleric is traditionally still
a viable melee character, my last character didn't really
give it up till near 20th... but in retrospect, the -reason-
that I wasn't doing decent damage anymore had as
much to do with my weaponry selection and my skill
as with the natural abilities of the class.  Weapon skill
caps at 175, up to that point skill can keep pace with
the tanks, and although some of the best weapons
-are- not cleric weildable, there seems to be a fair selection
of melee implements that -are-  Pick there right tools,
keep the skill up thru use, and I'm thinking there's no
reason that I shouldn't be a significant (not overwhelming)
force in a fight from 20 to 35... although I can only
say for sure that my former character was somewhat
effective thru 20 or so and again from 35ish to 49.
