I hate these little bastards!  Was working through LFay to Mistmoore with my
bard and a warrior.  Brownie kept coming up on track and it was like it was
tracking us it seemed, hehe.  We couldn't avoid it and it jumped me.  These
little bastards nuke HARD!  Needless to say, we both died.  I kept fearing
it, and would fire up Selo's and type RUN!  STAY WITH ME!...unfortunately,
my warrior buddy (who is normally excellent to play with) misread this as
GET IT! QUICK!  IT'S GETTING AWAY! and kept attacking it (we were down to
sliver of health) and he kept getting rooted.  This was interpretted through
the aftermath (CR) when he said "We would have had it if he hadn't kept
healing himself." and "He's fast, I couldn't catch him when you feared it".
Anyways, this thing was yellow to us, and we've ripped up yellows many
times.  Is this one of those "grotesque undercons" that I should really
avoid for several new levels?  The only other time I've encountered this
thing was like 3 days into EQ, wandering around with like a level 3 or 4
chanter or something.

TIA,
SEAN...
