I'll second this strongly.  I play an enchanter, a wizard, and a bard; the
enchanter and wizard are raid-capable 65s, the bard getting there at 57.

As an enchanter - if there's only one mob in camp (or two mobs and we are
offtanking) don't bother healing me until after the fight.  If I'm holding
mobs off the party, keep me alive.  My Runes should take most of the damage,
especially at post-60 where the enchanters have peridot-less runespells.

As a wizard - if I suck so badly as to pull aggro off the MA, I deserve
whatever rezz I get.  I bought three points of health regen, unless I've got
a totally sucky tank that's all the healing I need (AOEs excepted.)  I have
my epic, which soaks up 800 points of sloppy play on my part; non-epic
wizards have runespells they can use.  If they complain about the expense,
tell 'em to learn to play a wizard and gauge their damage to the MA's taunt.

As a bard - unless I'm puller or crowd-control, ignore me.  My health-regen
song will do all the healing I need.  If I'm pulling, I'd like to be at 80
pct health before I go back out - again, healsong will top me off fine.  If
I'm CC, see as enchanter - if I'm holding mobs keep me alive, if I'm not
ignore me for the MA.
