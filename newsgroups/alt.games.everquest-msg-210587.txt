Thats a thought, druids and rangers can turn you into a wolf, and enchanters
can turn you into a variety of things well before hitting the point where
they can turn you into player race illusions.

Sadly, though, SOE changed things so by and large the non player race
illusions don't change your faction, depending on what the OP was trying to
achieve with getting an illusion.
