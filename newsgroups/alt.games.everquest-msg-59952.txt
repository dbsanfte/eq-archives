FYI one of the main developers of ShowEQ is Rowyl, hired by verant
just like they said they'd hire the person who cracked their
encryption ;) He is now the head verant programmer for Luclin and
moving EQ to directx 8. 

In other words, since the guy is one of the original people to figure
it out now in his new job he is also a person who can probably make it
not work pretty fast, at least briefly.
