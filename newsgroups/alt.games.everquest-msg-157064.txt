At the point where somebody says "get a [classnamehere]" my first
impulse is to disband from the group.  There are circumstances that
will override that:  I'm with a friend or guildmate who wants to stay,
or the rare situation that virtually demands a class specific ability.
I play to have fun with other people, not to grab some bodies off the

meatrack and grind (ooooh, take the green Wizard, I hear they nuke

better).  If the group cares more about what than who I don't want any
part of it.

I've twice left groups where I was the healer.  Dumbasses constantly
whining about "we gotta get a healer" when (1) we were fighting near
constantly and nobody was dying, and (2) what down-time we had was
mostly due to dumbfucks whining instead of carrying their share of
the load.  (At around L30 3 Warriors and a Rogue can kill a lot of
mobs with a Paladin for a healer.)

I disagree, the minmaxmorons obsess every bit as much over any bit of
perceived efficiency, be it large, small, or in between.

My guild is of little use for grouping.  We're a "family-style social"
guild that has an almost militantly libertarian culture as far as
grouping and raiding go.  By that I mean that there is no meaningful
pressure to group together, and guild sponsored raids are exceedingly
rare.  About the only things that holds us together are that the active
officers mostly make a point of grouping with various guildmembers and
we do occasioanlly have small raids for various folks epics, thus
sustaining a certain minimum of camaraderie.  Which means that I get
to solo way more often than I want to.  I pretty much gave up on
pickup groups a long time ago, but from time to time the stars align
just right and I find myself in a group of strangers, usually it
works well, but when I start pushing to group more the first bad
experience is usually enough to get me to revert.

What're you trying to do?  Wreck the thread?  We need indignation,
not conciliation!  Self-righteousness, not thoughtfulness!  Good
grief man, this is usenet!  Besides, I got in all my "can't get a
group" whines a couple years ago, this is old news.  And I simply
can't imagine feeling sorry for Clerics, of all classes, in that
regard.  After all, back before I became a bitter ex-pickup grouper
(no bizbee, I'm not referring to a fish) I was victim far too often
to the "what do we need a Paladin for?  we've already got a Cleric
so your buffs are useless, your heals are weak, and your damage
sucks" attitude.  So I honed my soloing skills, enjoyed the hell
out of every chance to group with friends, and cut all those small
souled chumps out of my will (no rcsmiley, you can't have my stuff
either).
