I think that Verant has done more than what's necessary to uphold their end
of a person's responsibility.  At SOME point people have got to start saying
"damn, that was fucking stupid, and all my fault."

Hopefully this level 50 has learned something...to either never drop a bag
for an alt if he can't afford to lose it, or to turn drop confirmation back
on.  IT WAS HIS FAULT, NOT VERANT'S.

Just 2 nights ago (I have 2 computers) I borrowed my brother's druid for a
teleport.  I noticed he was wearing no shirt and had a leather face mask.
Soooo, I (enchanter) got him to port me to Ak'Anon where I bought a ruby and
made him a silver ruby veil.  In my bank I had a foreman's tunic as well.

I gave him the tunic and veil and about 10 seconds later I realize that the
screen said "no room" and dropped to the ground.  When I looked around, it
was no longer there.  DOH.  MY FAULT, I knew he had no more room in his
inventory.  So, I bought another ruby, failed to successfully make the veil.
I ended up spending 420p because of my mistake.  Did I whine, even know
that's 1/2 of my total cash (at level 52...pathetic, huh?)?  Not in game I
didn't. :)

I screwed up.  It's my fault.  I take responsibility for it.

So no, I don't think they should reimburse him or restore from a backup.  If
you screw up you have to pay a penalty.

Just last night a level 57 mage friend of mine (high elf...which goes
without saying, considering what I'm about to say) lost most of her
soulbound keys and some pieces of her epic quest when she forgot she put
them in a SUMMONED BAG.  She didn't petition and she politely took the abuse
we piled on her. :)
