Will mobs that summon continue to do so over and over? In other words, if 
you're summoned, can you run away again, and if so, do they typically 
immediately summon you again? Does the act of summoning drain their mana 
pool so that they can only do so a limited number of times?

I'm needing to take out some wurms for pieces for my epic, and I read that 
one of them (Eldrig the Old in Skyfire) summons, so I was wondering if a 
bard (me) would be able to solo it easily enough.
