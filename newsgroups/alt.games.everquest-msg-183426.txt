    I don't have that mentality and am happy to accept a reasoned argument
from someone who's never played a class if it makes sense and is based on
information they have. I'm not here to win any contests. (or I'd bring my
camera)

    I guess I bourght up BL vs ranger because while rangers tend (rangers in
this group pls just hold off from the flame I know you think you're uber and
love your class and all but there are plenty who think it needs a bit of
help) to say they are a bit underpowered, while I've read strong unopposed
posts to the effect that beastlords are overpowered, and I remember you
coming down hard on rangers who "whine" about their class and how they must
be crap players. Well two of my good friends in EQ are rangers who both feel
their class is underpowered. Both of them are excellent to group with and
one is a particularly talented puller. (sounds like half of us in here) But
my point is I'd consider either of them a cut above average players who'd no
doubt be quite insulted by your remarks, and by the sounds of it have a good
laugh if they tried out a BL.

    Well, I've got a 51SK and a lvl 20 chanter. You've played a lot more
classes than me to many levels but by the sounds of it I've got a little bit
more SK experience than you and neither of us know jack about the high end
game except what others post here. Not dickwaving here just summing up what
*looks* to be the situation. From your attitude towards me and my posts I
was guessing you had a few 65 retired toons.

    Spent any time in the PoJ? Why are you flaming ppl about it in another
thread? Particularly fear kiting there? Does your necro go there often? I
dunno, you might have the best info in the world about the place, but I've
got as much grounds for accusing you of posting ignorant (<STX>PI|MSG|<ETX>
ok I promise im going to bed soon) as you have with me.
