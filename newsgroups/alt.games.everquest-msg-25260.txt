=======Rant mode on======================
Raiding Naggy the other night, a piece of Mithril armor
dropped off one of the Fire Giants going in.  Back
item, AC 7, Wis 13, Int 13, tank classes only.

Dissapointing, since as a cleric I'm a plate class, and
would -love- to have a wis 13 back item...but thats
another story.

Point is, it was put to open roll to all tanks, a warrior
won it and looted it.  No Drop.

I wanted to scream, and came within a heartbeat
of gating out of the raid.

I had a Kunzar cloak on me the warrior could have
taken if he literally didn't have something to beat
AC 7.  At least the Kunzar has fire resist.

OK, I know that if you are deeply into trade skills
the wis and int stats can pay off... but I don't get
the impression this was the case here.

If I'd been a warrior, I'd certainly have rolled for
the thing, it was sweeeeet... but if I'd won, I'd
have deferred it to one of my hybrid buddies in
a heartbeat, no way I'd actually take the thing, only
reason I'd be rolling would be to double the odds
that someone I work with regularly would get it.

=======Rant mode off==============
Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.  Returning
to my regular routine of wandering around resing
people for ale, and occaisionally getting dragged off
to keep people alive while they kill stuff
