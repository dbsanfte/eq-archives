Ah, good information. Thanks. Now I feel a lot better. You've got me
wondering now if the improved damage is every time also, or if that one
is just a "chance of firing".

Also, if the spell haste one works every time, (and I wasn't timing my
gates with a stopwatch or anything, so I have no clue here) why didn't I
get the message "Your Bracelet of Woven Grass begins to glow" on every
gate cast? Got it on most, but not all. I was checking. Hrmm... so many
things to figure out with all these new toys!
