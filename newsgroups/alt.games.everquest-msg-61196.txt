Your best monetary deal may be for weapons.  Some good weapons seem to be
very cheap.  The worst is spending it on tradeskills.  You do tradeskills to
have fun (and they are fun), not to make money or SAVE money.  You would
have saved a hell of a lot of money just BUYING the banded pieces you made
from the loot you would have earned killing stuff instead of clicking on the
forge.  But that's 100% ok if you were having fun doing it.

I don't know anything about what armor is for sale that's good for you
though.  And I don't have prices or weapon information.  Hopefully someone
will post who provides much more useful answers about that. :)
