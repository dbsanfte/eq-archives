No. It is an EQ trilogy ACCOUNT KEY, good for 30 days of play
on a NEW account.

So it doesn't UPGRADE a current account, rather you register with it
for a NEW one which is kunark (and old EQ) and velious. If you
currently have kunark and velious on your puter, you can play in them
with this key on a new free account for 30 days. If you DON'T have
them installed, you'll have to get the files from someone else or
somehow else, even though with this free account key you'd be able to
go there for 30 days ON THE NEW ACCOUNT.
