ZoneAlarm works fine with EverQuest, but if you don't want it locking
you up after every patch, it's best to set _verQuest.exe and
EverQuest.exe to "identify program by path name only" to disable the
checksum that it uses to determine if a program has changed since the
last time you gave permission.
