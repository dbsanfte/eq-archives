Technically, no.  But I really really enjoyed the 63 rogue and 63 druid I 
was lent for an extended period of time.  Of course, I'd already agreed to 
marry the druid before she went on hiatus, so I already loved her. :)

It was funny.  Generally, I can't stand playing a druid (gave up on mine 
at level 11).  But I did quite like playing -that- druid.  Of course, when 
she came back, she explained to me at length about how I'd been doing it 
all wrong.  I'm so glad she's back! :)
