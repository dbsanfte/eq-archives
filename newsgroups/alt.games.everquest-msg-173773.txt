so i bought Everquest a looong time ago . . . my game just came in a cd
jewel case.  all i got was the cd, and the booklet "phat lewt" with
merchandise.  no account key . . . don't remember needing one.  now it's
asking for one.  what do i do!  i don't remember what station name i
registered under, and don't see an account key anywhere on the case or cd.
i wanna play now!  i emailed support but . . . i wanna play now!  =/

any ideas?  late-night lurking support ppl?
