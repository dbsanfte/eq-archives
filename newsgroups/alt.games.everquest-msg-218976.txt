kaev me thinks ya taking this shite a bit too hard.

My point was it would simplify and SPEED up the grouping process and
reduce downtime for everyone if this completely anal 7 level

people like driving nails into their skulls too. The complaint of the
dead time in LDoN is valid and I think this is the root cause.
