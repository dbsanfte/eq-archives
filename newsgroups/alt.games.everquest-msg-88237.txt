Charm and Fear effects are 2 different things... indeed 2 different spell
types

Charm duration IS affected by CHA... Fear is only your level-vs-his level...

The point of the original question asked at FanFair... does CHA have
anything to do with Fear spells is from the confusion that Druids get charm
AND fear against animals (cuz they're druids) and Necros get the same for
Undead (cuz they're Necros). Some people seem to assume that because
Druid/Necro Fear and Charm in thier own specialised areas, that it's a
function of the specialisation itself... but it's not.


Clerics get Fear-vs-all(AE and high-lvl) AND fear-vs-Undead (high-lvl)...
but no charms.
This is because their targets are 'in awe of the Clerics holy power' (see
note 1)

Enchanters get Fear-vs-all (low-lvl)... and Charms (high-lvl).
This is because Enchanters mess with your head on a one-to-one basis. (see
note 2)

Druids get Fear-vs-Animals (high-lvl)... and Charms-vs-Animals (high-lvl).
This is because they know what makes animals tick.

Necros get Fear-vs-Undead (high-lvl) and Fear-vs-All(low-lvl)... and
Charms-vs-Undead (high-lvl).
This is because they know what makes Undead tick. The low level fear-vs-all
is because Necros are generally spooky.

Hybrids (Pally, Ranger, ShadowKnight) all get reduced versions of their
parent classes Fear Spells... but none of the charms.
This is because Fear is something you can inspire through force-of-arms
(which is why Rogues and Monks can intimidate, even if they can't do it
through spell-casting) even though there's the limiting factor of the
parent-class's target-speciality. (see note 3)


To scare a target into running away from you, you only need to find ONE good
reason to cause their brain to reject the situation and put them into flight
mode... it could just be intimidation... it might be your classes
reputation... it could even be something in your appearance.

To CHARM a target, you may have to overcome a myriad of good reasons for why
your target shouldn't just pound your weedy body into a burger-patty. Or to
put it another way, try the following example...

You're about to ask <insert name of attractive woman> out on a date. (see
note 4)
She wouldn't ordinarily speak to you if you were alone together in a lift
trapped between floors for 6 hours... but you figure it'll be worth it if
they say "yes".
You ask her out... and she laughs back in your face... then proceeds to
humiliate you infront of a number of strangers by listing 6 or 7 reasons why
you repulse her and she'd prefer to submit to long and drawn-out dental
surgical proceedures with no anaesthetic. You're crushed by this rejection,
become a compulsive eater of comfort-food, and spend the next 12 years in
expensive therapy.(see note 5)

12 years later, you try again... after losing weight, getting a better job,
cosmetic surgery, a personal stylist to revamp your wardrobe, carefully
studying all the latest magazines to discover what topics of conversation
will be guaranteed to hold the attention of your chosen dreamgirl. She falls
for it and you both drive off together into the sunset in the back of your
chauffer driven Lexus.

Okay, that's complete daytime soap... but you get the idea... one tiny thing
and she runs away screaming... fix a half-dozen things and you've charmed
her into a carnal situation... THAT'S why Fear and Charm are different.






oh yeah... I guess I better write those notes...

Note 1... Think of the poster for the movie 'The Greatest Story Ever
Told'... that's what 'holy power' looks like. The way they kinda appear to
be lit-up from behind with their hair all windswept.

Note 2... yeah, yeah... I do KNOW about AE mezzing... but it IS one-to-one
really, but it happens so fast it LOOKS like it's AE ;o)

Note 3... I know SKs kinda throw the curve off a little... but they're a
pet-class *shrug*... I'm only doing one subject per week

Note 4... I'm not being sexist... you can edit that line to read (attractive
MAN) if you really must.

Note 5... This scenario has NOT happened to me personally... at least not
recently... or quite that badly ;o)
