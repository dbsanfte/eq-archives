The Twinks will win and the new players will get fed up with the constant
trouncing they get and quit.
No MMORPG has ever had a fair PvP system as character classes are just not
equally balanced in that respect. On top of this, EQ is heavily equipment
orientated, a 20th level Melee character with 20k worth of items is going
destroy one with 2k worth of items.

Want 6v6 Duals...go to the Arena, trouble with PvP outside of an arena is
that exp loss is not guaranteed, you die, you take an exp loss and CS will
say "when dualling outside an arena, you are never guaranteed no exp loss"
