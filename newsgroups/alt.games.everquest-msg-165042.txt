I'd suggest the Warrens for quick cash at your level but if I remember
there's lots of Druid spells that don't work indoors.

Definately worth setting up shop. Unfortunately the best selling times are
in the evening which is probably also your best playing time. Still it's
worth setting up as a trader once you're done playing for the evening. Silk
swatches and pelts should sell well. Check other vendors for prices. I can't
say about the acorns.

Depends on what you're looking for, armor, weapons, stat items?
