Perhaps this post comes from the frustration of an abnormally low I.Q?
Because he cannot figure out how to play the game correctly?

However I will say that video games are an escape, however unlike Smoking
this does not cause cancer.  Unlike drinking this does not erode your liver.
I gues what I am trying to say is that everyone needs a release.  Some
people mountain bike, some people skydive, some people play Everquest.
There is nothing wrong in this.  Basically out of your post Hotwizard I get
this, that anyone who seeks a release from the stress of normal life has
problems?  Oddly enough too your posting name is Hotwizard?perhaps you
should remove the plank from your eye...
