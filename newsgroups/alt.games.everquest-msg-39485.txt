Maybe because the belief is that what has happened in the past will and often
does happen again. Experience tells us that Verant puts very nice items in low
level new zones that are better then 99% of what a high level player can every
get. For examples see, Idol of Thorn and Silver Gilded Tiny Skull Earring. Heck,
even the new Stoneburnt Mountains zone (one with the code in place) has a pair
of boots that is better then anything a monk can reasonably obtain until after
level 54 or so.
