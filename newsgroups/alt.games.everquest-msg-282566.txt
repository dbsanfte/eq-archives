Quite a few ppl that I know also played way longer than they normal did.

It certainly changed the way I normally played, normally I would have some 
specific goals, like dodh arcs or signet rings, instead it was all about 
the grind baby. Finally catching up on some of those defensive aas that I

Spell casters aren't as disadvantaged, my shammy alt spends a lot of time 
practising spells whilst my main is raiding.
Melee are definately gonna be screwed over for a bit.

But all true new people that come up through monster missions aren't really 
gonna have a clue how to play their classes or what other classes can do.
