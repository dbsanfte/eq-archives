Nice indeed, but in a way have to earn you money is part of the
charm i guess, but it can shure be frustrating at times, as a caster
i can't use much armour but spells cost and i wan't the enchanted fine
steel great staff, and yes i use a 2h blunt and i like it, wrong way
to play a necro shuuuuure but that is the way for me *s*

Bind is also a nice thing that you can do for doantions, and as always
collecting thoose bone chips will give you something like 2pp / stack
or all the way up to 5pp
