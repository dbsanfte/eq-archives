That is wierd. As said I encountered it only when the mob was out of
reach. When fear kiting at the dulak docks I had my pet guard and pulled
a mob. Immediately I ordered my pet to attack and ran towards it. It was
a very reliable tool as I did not look backwards but as soon as my pet
starts off I knew the mob is in a good range to fear it. :)
