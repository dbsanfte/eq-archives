I have only ever had the lull, soothe line of spells work once, all other
times it was resisted and caused trains and my death. This was with 182
charisma at the time ( I know I was twinked), now at lvl 44 and 202 charisma
this line of spells still does not work so my hat off to you for being the
only chanter i have met to successfully use that spell :o)

Charm (with 184cha) at that level was practically useless and I did not
start to use it until I had beguile. Now with Cajoling whispers I can charm
a Ry'Goor Elite and have it rip through 6 giants before making it guard a
spot and finish it. The DD's become more mana efficient and the MezBomb
works nice with Anarchy onwards but does work lower down. With rooting and
DoT, the mob will resist the root twice per tick instead of once so = Dead
chanter

Group group group is the only real way a chanter should go, with so many
spells the combinations of soloing are immense.
