The game can already be played with the "basic" video card. I believe at
Fan Faire and the like they used Radeon 9600 without much trouble.  Their
purpose is to design a game where the grahpics will not be obsolete in 3-5
years, but rather will grow upward as technology does.

They aren't making it so resource intensive because they have no choice.
They are doing it because they WANT to...they want it to compete
graphically 3-5 years from now.  Until then the graphics configuration
will be so detailed that it will be able to dumb itself down pretty far,
as well as ramp itself up to take advantage of obscenely good cards.
