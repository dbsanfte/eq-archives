After 20 years in IT, my polite response is <sigh, invoke glazed look,
"oh what fscking fruit cake do we have here" mode> "Gee, In 20 years of
IT, I've never been asked that question before. Just exactly when does
it happen in your company".

Then I start considering whether to drive the knife deeper or just
terminate the interview (done that too).

Life is too short to choose to work in some companies.
