This "feature" sounds like it was ripped entirely from FFXI.

So if a friend and I are walking along and he gets jumped, I cannot assist
him? If I am on my way back to my home city and I see a lower level
character being attacked and about to suffer almost certain death at the
hands of a much higher MOB, I cannot help him with the fight? No thanks. I
had too much of that crap in FFXI.

I played EQ for years and EQ2 does sound promising, but this is a game
breaker for me.
