There was a US commentator on earlier today discussing 
that this was such a shock because Americans truly want 
everybody to like them, and can't understand it when 
somebody *doesn't* like them and does something like 
this, and they are unable to connect the at-home 
terrorist attacks with their foreign policies.

May I ask, does anybody know what he was talking about?  
He didn't clarify :/
