This does not match my observations at all. I know for a fact that we will
take completely incompetent 60 clerics with few questions asked. All they
have to be able to do is listen and do what they are told . Any real skill
is not required. If over time they appear to have any real skill they may be
trusted in the cheal rotaion for hard mobs . This requires the ability to
count to 10 and is somewhat beyond the capabilities of half our clerics. The
ones who cannot manage to count , and god we have these too are relegated to
healing the secondary tank groups or if they happen to be really bad the
casters.

oddly enough I was a mainly grouping druid while I was still a druid. The
only times a druid can get better exps soloing is when all the available
toons for a group are significantly incompetent. Since a significantly
incompetent group can actually take you backwards in experience instead of
fowards this is understandable . Since druids have such a low utility in a
good group they tend to get the incompetent toons. For this reason my druid
always loved guild groups above all others. I had the signal rare honor of
my first guild being the monk guild. My first guild was small containing
about 20 people 10 of which where monks which was all but 2 monks on the
server. Nothing compared to watching the 4 monk, 1 druid group on seafury
island switching off every pull who was tanking. The experience was
phenomenal for the time(pre kunark)
