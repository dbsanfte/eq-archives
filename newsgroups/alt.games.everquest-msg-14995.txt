I'm no expert, but I have read that fear and charm are broken on PvP
servers.

As far as Shaman go, I would recommend an Evil race. In the short time
I have spent on the new Sullen-Zek I have seen almost 75% Evil
races/classes.

When I asked about classes I was told that the following were best for
PvP (in no particular order):
Necro
Druid
Shaman
Bard
