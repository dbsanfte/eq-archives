Aye, I am currently wielding either the Centi SS or Lammy in my offhand,
depending on my mood that day. (I didnt make a trade for it, but was
considering it)  I wanted to put a Centi LS there instead of either one of
those as the ratio is a little better and the stats are pretty nice.  I am
a 39 Warrior and wield a Wurmy in my mainhand. I never have a problem
gaining aggro even with the Wurmy's delay.  I would like to get something
a bit faster, but the Ratio on the Wurmy is so nice, almost anything else
would be a downgrade at this point.
