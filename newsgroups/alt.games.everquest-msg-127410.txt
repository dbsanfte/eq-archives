*chuckle* let me put it this way - GuildMagic does a FAR better job of 
illustrating the point than I do:

Okay, *second* most original name :D  (Actually, I stand by my original 
statement, as "Eye Jugglers" still gives me a weirder mental picture: 
Guild Member: Oh, you want to fight tough, eh, Lord Yelinak?  Well watch 
THIS! *pop pop* *juggle*
Yelinak: ::gets ill and runs away, dropping his talisman on the way::
(at this point, a random Monty Python member steps in with "Stop that! 
It's SILLY.")

Yes, but in the meantime, they're a) not shoving dozens of annoying pop-
ups in my face (if I ever find that !@#$!#@ purple monkey I'm going to 
make a rug out of it) and b) not nearly as prone to limiting what I put 
on my site.
