The guy that left was a twat. The only giants (including sea furies, Hill
giants, sandgiants etc) that you can mez are the ones in Burning Woods. Mez
is a spell i always keep memmed. You get a lot of wanderers (burynai etc)
that can be mezzed, The main thing against giants is to slow them, after
tank pulls tashani it, then slow. If you have a shaman then he should slow
as it is better unless shaman is being used as healer. Haste all your
fighters, I always used Celerity if plenty of mana (not slowing ) or
augmentation if low on mana resources. Other than that you cannot do much
else apart from charm. If there is an over pull then charm one and stick it
on the main target, but watch for the charm break
