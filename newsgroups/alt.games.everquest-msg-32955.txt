Ayep...my rogue got his JBoots at level 38 out from under a level
45 Mage and a Level 52 Wizard.  Neither could nuke to kill him,
and I'd already had him engaged.  I landed three nearly-max backstabs
with a borrowed 12 damage weapon, and for some reason got the
credit for the kill.  The other two actually applauded, saying that
was a pretty good trick to evade after the nukes in time to backstab
'im.

The wizzie was low on mana, and the Mage was nuking for all
he was worth.  Both of 'em were trying to KS from each other,
and I just lucked out.  Nobody had any hard feelings, though,
because I'd always heard it was generally accepted fact that
of  all the mobs in Norrath, the Ancient Cyclops (and this is
important) in S. Ro ONLY is the one that nobody will generally
bitch about as Kill-Stolen.

Watch 4 different wizzies over level 50 start casting Ice Comet
at the same time in S. Ro, and you'll see what I mean...
:-)
