Apparently the english language is also difficult for you, as you don't
understand the meaning of the simple words like "newbie" or "greenhorn."
Here's some help, "newbie" does not mean "someone I disagree with."  You
want to call me arrogant, feel free, I am a cocky son of a bitch.  None the
less, if you insist on using words that you know don't mean what you're
using them for, I can only assume you have the intellect somewhere near the
moth that's bouncing around outside my window.

So, what's it to you if I am?  I also hate Japanese, Irish, Whites,
Mexicans, American Indians, Blacks, Theists, Agnostic, Athiests, the rich,
the poor, the middle class, all military, and all civillians, one eyed one
horned fine purple people eaters, tofu (especially in a nice miso soup), and
green eggs and ham.  Who cares?  I'm not starting news groups to advertise
my hatred of them.

Since your referesher only shows your lack of a grip, you may not want to
refer back to it.

Usenet is public only if you have access to it.  Cox, however, is a company,
and not the "public internet."  It is Cox that I want to take action, not
the government.  Oh, and I don't work for Cox.

Oh, I had no intention of questioning your age.  There are many who don't
pay for access besides kids.  I'm just saying your sense of reality seems
distorted, as you think you're entitled to something you're not.  But, hey,
don't let the fact that you're a moron keep you from making assumptions.
