You don't buy it. You go up to one of the skelly guards outside, in the
newbie area, and say to them, "I need a key". They will give it to you.
The only way to use it, though, is to be almost on top of the button,
hold the key on your mouse pointer, and press "U" or whatever your "Use"
hotkey is mapped to.
