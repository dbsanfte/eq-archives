How so?  At level one he regens what, four more HP per tic sitting than a human, at
level 65 he regens four more HP per tic sitting than a human... not 24 more or...well
maybe I'm mixed up somehow, but assuming you put no points into regen type AA, I
noticed no change to HP regen with my troll from level one to 51 that wasn't mirrored
by my dwarf's

So what are the actual figures?  AFAIK trolls have an enormous edge at level one over
untwinked non uberbuffed  non troll (and iksar of course).  This edge, however,
dwindles in importance as he levels up, while his exp penalty remains the same.  This
dwindling is even more noticable if regen gear and equipment and AA are added in to
the mix, as none of those cost the recipient any exp, and the "native" regen of the
troll doesn't multiply their effect, it still remains its level one constant adding
to the greater and greater regen everyone with the same gear, level, and equipment
get.

I'd be happy to hear otherwise, I've been wrong and admitted it quite a few times in
this newsgroup... getting mistakes like this corrected really helps me understand the
game better, so I'm glad of it.  On the other hand, if you are just looking at things
differently than I am, well, you're going to have a harder time convincing me your
point of view is more accurate.
