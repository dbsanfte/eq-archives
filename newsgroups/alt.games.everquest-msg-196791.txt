It is all about aggro. I repeat that all the time. With a good MA, I
can greatly increase the DPS.

Now in PVP, if I can keep the vic- I mean my opponent off balance and
me moving, he is toast.

I move through, turn and BS, keep using a pumice stone to debuff see
invis if I think it is going on, If I can stay away from the player's
front, I will win.

I will look for you on MT, and we will get you the 29!
