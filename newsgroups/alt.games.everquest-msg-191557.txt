Another thang you can do is go to the newpaper that is local to the
service member IE home were wife or loved one is or home town. order
him/her a sub for 6 months of sunday papers to be MAILED snale mail to
him /her so when thay come home 6 or 8 months of is not totaly gone. and
beleave me this will allso get the person lots of respect amongst his
fellow crew members. the peaple over there are dieing (so to speak) to
know the real world is still at least in part behind them and all is
well... 
     THIS is the first time in 24 years that I am not in the thick of
it.
I know how hard it is not knowing whats going on anywere but were you
are (RIGHT NOW and HERE) the rest of the world seems like its on hold.
never getting to hear the new songs on the radio or not seeing the new
movies that just came out. missing your kids birth day or even birth.
something as stupid as a Newspaper once a week can help. (allso lots of
food to)
