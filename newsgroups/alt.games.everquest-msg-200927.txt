** Experience System Changes - Round Two **

In the test server update that occurred earlier today (server downtime), 
and in the PoP Zones Update that just occurred (PoP zones downtime), there 
were a number of tuning changes made to the new experience system and the 
PoP zones themselves.

The effect of these changes should more closely match the intent that was 
described in the original message. The first round of changes, by the 
numbers, didn't.

It went the right direction in all cases, and a number of the group size vs 
target type combinations were covered well. However, there were a number of 
cases where the target was overshot.

Among these:

- Not generous enough vs PoP NPCs for groups of all sizes, the smaller 
groups and soloists being the hardest hit.

- Too generous with 4-6 man groups vs Non-PoP NPCs who can, in some cases, 
barely hurt their attackers.


If you're interested in helping test these most recent changes, here is the 
list of combinations that we're trying to make sure all reward 
appropriately:

Solo - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range
Solo - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range
Solo - PoP
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range
Small Group (2-4) - PoP 
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range
Group (5-6) - PoP 

Please keep in mind while testing out group experience, as always, group 
bonuses only apply according to the number of people who are in range. 

Feel free to try out as many combinations as you can. As before, we look 
forward to hearing opinions on these changes via the boards and Dev Corner. 
Thanks very much for helping out!
