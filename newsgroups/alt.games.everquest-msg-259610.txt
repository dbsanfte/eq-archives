I think they're still saying mid-Sepetember.   14'th is the current rumor.

To begin dragging a corpse, you target the corpse and type /corpsedrag.   To
stop dragging a corpse, you target the corpse again and type /corpsedrop.
You are allowed to drag up to two corpses at a time using this method.

You do not have to keep hitting /corpse or any other hotkey, the corpse(s)
automaticly follow at your feet, stopping wherever you stop.

I'm not sure if you can use /corpse in addition to this to drag a 3'rd
corpse.   Perhaps someone else has tried?

I'm not sure of the specifics of the new consents, so I'll let someone else
give you more details on those.
