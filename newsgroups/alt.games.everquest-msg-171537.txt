I solo there on and off, have since my low 40s, in the vague hope of getting a
group (never seems to happen) or managing to pop Eldrig the Old on my own.  I
can muster a guild force (what, two people?) to come kill him but not to sit
around forever hoping he spawns.

At any rate, the mobs have too many HP to be really worthwhile exp, plus some
(wurms, wyverns) are still immune to my fire dot at 52, which means cutting
either a quarter of my damage output, or only an eighth (but in that case,
memming the magic based dot instead of fire means cutting the 8th out of all
kiting, not just those mobs)  Furthermore, the chromodracs debuffing is not a
joke for someone who must stay out in front of the mobs (bard is a no contact
class), meaning that they also cut 1/4th my damage output (I have to snare
them instead of keeping TBoots/Selos on myself), and I don't find their blood
boiling dot at all amusing, although my cleric laughed uproariously at it...
I'm unbuffed, and the chromos make sure I stay that way, and they dont' always
take the blood boil away reliably.  I ran out from under one just today, and
let it run its course, to the tune of half my HP bar!

I tried charming a bit as well, and found that the mobs have relatively low
damage output coupled with their overly large HP totals, which means the
fights are long and charm breaks several times per kill.

Compared to say Spirocs (one charmed mob will often kill two or three before
finally dying) or the giants at the BW fort (an ancient will literally kill a
fully popped fort if there are no other ancients up, takes a couple charms but
thats fine)

As for bard quadding... well if someone wants to explain to me how to do this
with one targetable AE spell, which takes all my mana to cast, I'd be happy to
nod along.  If there's some way to kill 4 angry mobs with PB AE Dots without
getting in melee range.... well I doubt I'm up to it but perhaps if you use
small words I'll get the gist.  I often do pull 4 mobs at once, having the
charmed one get beat down by 3 buddies makes for a pretty fast kill... but you
said not charming.

If there's a good way to hunt solo in SF as a 52 bard, I'm all ears, I'd
really like to get moving on that Eldrig drop anyway.
