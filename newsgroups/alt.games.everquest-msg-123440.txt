Don't wory,

He won't be able to take out Rage with 8 people.

Last time we did it we needed a minimum of 24. Sure - one group held the
camp while the rest of the Guild bound there/had a porter with them while
they did other things.

When Rage finally spawned (36 hours later) we were able to assemble and kill
him in under 3 minutes.

The previous time we tried Rage, another Guild was present. A GM randomed
the spawn and we lost. Same thing happened this time and we won the roll.

Doesn't seem like a big deal to me.
