Any brand of card that sports an Nvidia GeForce 3 Ti is your
cheapest upgrade path.  You can find the Ti 500 models for
about $170 and the Ti 200 models for less.  Both of these
are 64MB AGP4x cards.

You didn't say what cpu you're running, but since your present
video card is an older model I suspect your cpu is also, and
therefore you'd probably be wasting your money if you bought
one of the newer model Geforce 4xxx cards.  The Geforce 3 cards
are last year's technology, but then so is EQ.

Avoid any card with an "MX" in its name.

I'm using a Geforce 3 Ti 500 in my P4/1.8 WinME system with the
latest drivers without any recent problems*, and I have all the
Luclin graphics switched on.


(*) fingers firmly crossed that I haven't awakened any sleeping gods!
