Most likely if this one goes live then it won't be easy to get.

Don't like it then don't use it.

Don't like it then don't use it.

Again, don't like it then don't use it.

Yeah you'll have a little trouble scribing Lure of Frost if you are a
necro.

Whats your point? Don't like it, don't use it...sound fairly simple to
me.

No difference to now. Unresistable damage tends to come at a price, so
I'd say this is an all-target-allowed, more-efficient than lure of ice
spell.

Doubt it'd be much more damage than an unresisted sunstrike. And
wizards have lived with that spell for a long time.

Pretty stupid cleric to not realize.

Doubt it will be that "easy".
