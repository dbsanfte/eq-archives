This has been the case since about 6 months of the game release. 
Quested items, by and large, are worthless.  And anything you can
get to drop, you can get to drop ten more times, then buy
something worth 10 times what that item is worth.  

That doesn't mean that acquiring gear loses any interest, its
just that the "quest" is to get enough cash together to buy that
next big thing you could never hope to loot.  If "the next big
thing" target was something that drops in a camp 10 levels higher
than you are, and mudflation gradually moves the bar so the same
amount of cash will now get you an item from a camp 15 levels
higher than you are, that doesn't change the nature of that quest
at all.

The only real cap is at the very high end where you are buying
Ornate or something along those lines, and even then you aren't
close to the top of the game, you are just getting geared up to
the extent that you can skip past a lot of lower level raid
content... but you still need to move to the raiding game and do
a lot of work there in order to get flagged and no drop raid
geared up to where you can get into the higher level raids...

Eventually you do end up capped out with all the best stuff in
the game, if you want to pursue it that far, but its not because
of mudflation, at the top end of the game mudflation has very
little real effect at all, since the gear you are looking for is
no drop raid only anyway.

Now I personally do get bored from time to time, and what I do is
change to a new character.  New class, new race, new fun.  I like
twinking out a character and racing him up the ladder swimming
with outrageous power... and I also like -not- twinking, clawing
my way up from the bottom the hard way, which is what my mage is
doing, currently still wearing mostly his quest gear from his
first ten levels.

Pick a new challenge, however you like it, and do that for a
while.  Go back to the old character if you like, or get serious
about the new one, or move again... its a game, so just follow
your bliss.

I do like doing things with friends, and I like meeting new
friends, and I like soloing... it doesn't have to be efficient,
either, I soloed my cleric a great deal from 35+ and I don't
think anyone can accuse me of power gaming there!
