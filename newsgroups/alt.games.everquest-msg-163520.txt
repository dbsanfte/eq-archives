Comparing HP healed per mana spent

Remedy: 438 hp for 175 mana: Ratio 2.5.
Funny, this is better ratio than ER!  Its dirt cheap to cast, too,
and fast and long range, I used it heavily up till PoP.  438 hp just
doesn't mean much of anything in PoP encounters, though, this kind of
damage I generally just ignore even on casters, or if topping off,
waste the extra 125 mana by casting CE on them instead of worrying
about using up another slot.  I might make a point of memming it
again while doing old world work with my lower level friends,
though.  Probably not.

Ethereal Remedy: 975hp for 400 mana: Ratio 2.44
note that with Supernal Remedy in your book there's no reason I can
think of to EVER cast this again

Celestial Elixer: 1000 hp for 300 mana: Ratio 3.333
As I said, I use this as my "small heal" as its the only thing I've
got that doesn't cost at least 400 mana!

Supernal Remedy: 1522 hp for 400 mana: Ratio 3.8
Supernal Light: 2750 hp for 600 mana: Ratio 4.58
Cast time 3.75 seconds, or under 3 seconds with mage focus and BoR.
This is the equivalent of druid incomplete heals but can be spammed
out far faster, looks like the holy grail of an upgrade to CHeal at
last, if the fight is short enough to not run you out of mana.
(not that I have this in my book yet)

Supernal Elixer: 2000hp for 400 mana: Ratio 5
Cast time 4 seconds, or 3 seconds with mage focus and BoR, takes 24
seconds to deliver the heal, though, and not stackable.  Works great
to take the edge off heavy hitters, however, and almost no aggro
associated with it at all, this spell is vital to your survival in
PoP encounters

Complete Healing: 7500hp for 400 mana: Ratio 18.75
Cast time 10 seconds, immutable

Hmm, in 10 seconds I could cast SL three times (if I could trick past
any cycling problems) for 8250 hp healed... but that doesn't count
any of the AA abilities that increase hp healed, none of which work
with CHeal.  Its entirely possible I could heal twice as many HP in
that ten second time span using this strategy, particularly on a
relatively low HP tank.  Mana flow would of course be deeply worse,
but other AA and focus effects could reduce that a bit, more to the
point, a less chunky HP flow could mean the difference between life
and death on some of the extraordinarily hard hitting mobs of the PoP
expansion.
