> If he is juggling tells, thats exactly the scenario discussed.

To quote the original message:

"Why do people invite you to join a group before asking?  I was invited
3 times in a matter of miutes by different people without once being
asked.  Once was by a 2st level, once by a 6th and once by an 11th.
I have 7 Dwarf Cleric.  What's up with this?"

If he said a matter of seconds, I would see your point.  Since he said a
matter of minutes, which to me means no more than one a minute, I don't see
your point.  If he had even just added, "while I was trying to send tells to
others," I would also see your point, but again, that is not the case.
