the /who command will tell you the race, guild, and level of another
PC, assuming that PC isn't in "anonymous" mode.  to use the command,
type:

/who playername

to see info about that player.

archie or jughead would probably know.  :-)

assuming you meant "rivervale", the answer is: it depends.  the server
you're on, your level, the level of the SOWer, how busy the SOWer is,
how generous the SOWer is feeling, can all play a part.

a rough guess would be "a few plat".
