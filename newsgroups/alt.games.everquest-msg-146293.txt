hardly intelligent to even put in that nerf in the first place.  
they were running on pure corporate greed/instinct when they noticed 
the mass cancellations going on.

...and i'm sure lots of people were cancelling.  just browse through the 
different message boards, newsgroups, etc and take note of all the people  
(from how many classes) who've threatened or said they've actually quit.  
i've never seen the players as a whole do something like that before.

i hope they've learned not to mess with people who solo anymore.  i, and 
i'm sure many others, are all for rewarding people who group and so far 
it looks like they're headed in that direction.
