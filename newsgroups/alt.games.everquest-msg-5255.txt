Hello all.
    Ok,  I've gotten my DE cleric to level 22 since I started playing.
At times, very casually.  it took at least a 3 month break at one
point.  Now this part may get me flamed but please hold back and try to
advise me on this.  I share my account.  My roommate absolutely thought
I would love the game.  So I made a few chars and deleted them until I
started my cleric.  He then told me he wasn't going to play all that
much and I could use the account all I wanted.  So I did.  Being on
Fennin Ro, the guild DeVir is there.  I love them.  They're the dark elf
role-playing guild, really great guys but also selective and strict.
So, I never joined cuz I figured one, I was new, and 2, it wasn't my
account. But I got my cleric up to 22 and my friend never said
anything.  So I went and got into the guild.  Nice little ceremony, a
few people I had to impress.  I got the guild head and one other to
speak on my behalf and I got in.  3 days later, my friend starts playing
again like it's his job.  I'm not complaining about him playing.  But
I'm going to get my own account now.  But I want to get back into
DeVir.  How do I handle this with my guild?  Do I tell them?  Do I stage
a role-playing event where I challenge the guild leader and get thrown
into the Hole in Paineel and then try to get back in again?  Please help
me.  I love this guild.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Maleik <DeVir>- Cleric of Innoruuk - Fennin Ro
