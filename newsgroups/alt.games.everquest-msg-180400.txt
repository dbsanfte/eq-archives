I'm going to be starting a few new characters on my new account, and will 
be PLing them with a chanter.  I've used my chanter before to PL, but am 
sure there must be better ways.

1) I was farming the eyes in the Gorge and a level 20 warrior walks through 
so I decide to PL him while I farm.  I'd start with a debuff ( to help the 
warrior hit the thing ), and let the pet get it down to about 5-10% life,  
mez it, then blur it.  Warrior breaks mez and kills it as it runs.

2) Low level warrior friend.  Took him to South Ro.  Cast Illusion:Fire 
Elemental and Berserker for the "rune" componant.  Get 3-5 orcs pissed at 
me and sit down in the middle of them.  When they get low, stun and root 
them and let him finish them.

Pets are still breaking mez, so I'm going to avoid #1 for a while.  Is 
there a better way to PL a new BL with a chanter than #2 up there?  I'll be 
buffing them up, of course.

I'm pretty sure it will be a BL, probably Troll or Iksar ( love the pets ).  
Too many cats out there, and I don't like the bear pets.  Besides swimming, 
whats are the differences between Troll and Iksar that would affect playing 
a BL?  I think Iksar get better AC, while the Troll will have better Str 
and Sta.  Anything else worth mentioning?  I don't give a crap about 
faction, I can deal with that.  Any major armor / weapons that only one of 
the two races will be able to use?

And now the obligatory starting equip portion of the post.  I'll probably 
dump about 500pp of stuff on this guy, so no major twinkage.  I'm going to 
assume that H2H weapons are the way to go, but if that's not right, please 
let me know.  Any suggestions on armor and weapons would be appreciated.  I 
just trivialed Wu's, so I can make some of that to cover the spots I don't 
buy items for.
