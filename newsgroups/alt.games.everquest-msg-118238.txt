You should check out his site, he details how he does the mapping.  He,
generally, will not post a half assed attempt at a map, he will only post
complete maps created from the log of someone, often himself, who has
explored the zone in question completely.  PoG should be easy, just get
someone nonKoS up there to map it out.  Fear, Hate, and PoA, are a bit
tougher, and PoM is a pain in the butt as I understand it.  Sleepers tomb,
well, unless some high end guild person is interested in logging and sharing
the info, is not going to happen.  Most, if not all, of the other zones are
also the more difficult zones.

I agree, that a mediocre map is better than none, which is why I always go
to eqatlas first, then, if there is no map there, I check eqmaps.
