Playing cleric in DL, I've often wondered about these:

1)  Why don't druids cast pack spirit?  Most of the time they will
individually sow people, namely, themselves and the meleers who demand
SoW.  Sometimes, I get SoW, but in DL I don't bother to ask anymore.
I haven't worked with shamans a lot, so don't know if they tend to use
their group SoW. 

2)  Why do mages insist on using the earth pet?  Once I asked a mage
to please use another pet and they were insistent on using the earth
pet.  Another member even chimed in agreeing with me, but the mage
wouldn't budge.  Fortunately, the pet's root doesn't usually stick.  I
play a mage and I know they have other pet options at those levels,
and just sigh when mages joining my group have their faithful earth
pet in tow (my mage personally likes fire pets for soloing)

3) Why don't shamans always have a pet up?  I doubt their pet could
possibly outdamage the warrior in the group!

And  more general question:

4) What is so  hard about fixing AFK so that people who zone in after
you go AFK will see your AFK tag in the who list and by your name when
standing next to you?  I wonder if LFG works the same way.  I should
do a search on this topic in dejanews...
