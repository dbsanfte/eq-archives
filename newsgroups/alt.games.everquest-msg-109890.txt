Why do you all seem to think that the EQ client sends the checksum to the
server?

From what I've seen, the patcher downloads a file that contains the
checksums of all the current files, checks to see if any of your files are
out-of-date, downloads any that need to be updated, and then runs the
client.

I don't think there is any server-side checking going on.
