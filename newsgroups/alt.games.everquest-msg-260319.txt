40% :-)  Although, this is an example of where vision met reality and
the vision should have yielded.  The notion of the xp penalty is that,
at a given level a hybrid was more powerful than a specialized class.
However, it didn't take into account the fact that the penalty didn't
actually slow a hybrid down in groups - since the split was based on
total XP, they got 40% more than a non-hybrid of the same level.  It
also didn't take into account that you eventually cap your levels, at
which point the hybrid would be a no-brainer over a specialized class.

(see rangers in rubicite vs. warriors in rubi)

22 to 25 or 26 with my bard, 30 some to 32.

There are things I didn't like about the original vision (to
differentiate between intended game mechanics and implementation
problems) and am glad to see gone.  However, there are a lot
of things about it that are gone that I wish weren't.  I think
PoK is an abomination.  Boats were too slow, but PoK swung the
pendulum way to far the other way, and there's no going back.

If they had simply introduced a travel mechanic that was faster
than running/boats, but not tremendously, they could have iteratively
increased travel speed until they had the right balance of convenience
and sense of vastness to the world.  As it was, they destroyed 
the sense of world in one fell swoop, and it's never to be regained.
