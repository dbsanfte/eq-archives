Considering I'm not particularly religious, unlikely.  But then you knew
that because you googled through all my posts to pick out a couple bits you
could toss together in some way that you thought would be witty instead of
just showing a little bit more of that obsessive personality we've all come
to known and tolerate for the sake of the few times you fly so far off the
handle it gives everyone a good laugh.  =P

And yeah, I'd stand on top of your trader.  I have hide traders clicked, and
consciously keep it clicked, secure in the knowledge that anyone that wants
an item off your trader can do the same to hide mine.

Oh, "relatively argumentative" from you is *almost* as amusing as the
initial rant.  =)
