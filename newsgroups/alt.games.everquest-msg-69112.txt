I have had some strange instances since the last patch with the default
interface.  Like the border and the HP and MANA bars look like they are a
lesser resolution.  The gameplay window looks great when I hit F10 but when
I go back to default mode the outside skin looks bad.  I have P3 550, 512,
megs ram, GEforce2 with latest drivers.  Everything else looks fine until I
get to character select screen and it looks like it has lost resolution some
how and looks sub standard.  Come on guys give me some good advice.  This
hurts my eyes!!!!
