So spend some time aquiring items that buff your skill-up stat. By the
way, from everything I've heard on EQTraders.com, if WIS is higher than
INT, then WIS is what's determining your skill-up rate, not INT. As a
barbarian, your base WIS is 70, higher than your INT, so you want to go
out and find +30 (total) WIS gear to bank for the days you go out to do
your tradeskill stuff. +30 WIS wouldn't be that difficult to find, even at
your level.
