I don't see this as dead at all, now its just less direct.  For example,
I saw Aegolism for sale for 450pp a while ago in bazaar.  Bought
myself a copy, and bought the other 4 copies as well.  Put the
other copies on my mule at 1800 pp, which is at least 200pp under
the general "going rate" and have gradually sold off two, with one
still available.  Since I spent 1800 all told, that means I got a free
copy of the spell, have made 1800pp so far, and still have a copy.

If I was into being a resell merchant, I could, I'm quite certain, do
the same thing not once a day but a dozen times a day, and thats
not counting things like buying  spiderling silks, leather pelts, and
turning them into leather paddings which sell for a hundred times
as much.
