512mb ram, p3 800, 64mb DDR video here.  It takes almost 10 minutes to load for
me, too.  I only have 3 of the options turned on, Medium texture selected, and
only 6 of the HQ models selected.  

Another annoying thing about the load time is that they reload everything if you
switch servers.  Whose bright idea was this?  Jeezus, how hard can it be to not
unload everything when switching servers.  If you exit totally and re run it,
sure that's to be expected, but wtf were they thinking when they decided to
reload everything when you just switch servers?  Buncha idiots working there.
And the load time for zones sucks too, even with cache turned on.  Totally
rediculous.  EverQuest my ass, more like Ever Wait for the game to load.
