Not to go OT, well...yes, that's exactly where I am going to go.  Once upon my life,
I delivered pizzas for a living.  The day came where I brought a pizza to this
particular man.  After paying me and giving me a tip, he said "Pardon me, may I ask
you a question?"
Me: "Sure"
Him: "I would call you the pizza-man or pizza-boy if you were a male.  What should I
call you since you       aren't?"
Me: "Pizza-chick".
He looked offended and opened his mouth to argue that one, then couldn't because some
other part of his brain took over and made him laugh.  At least he didn't ask me to
give the tip back.
