Bristlebane showed up in various zones in E. Marr.  Oasis, EC, WFP, probably
others as well.  EC was a major mistake, he immediately got mobbed by the
idiots looking for phat lewtz.  He did actually pose a riddle, which someone
guessed correctly.  Not sure what if any reward said person got, as the lag,
from having about 100 idiots hitting him, and doing no appreciable damage,
was terrible.
