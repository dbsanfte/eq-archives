Tired of slaughtering greenies with my Troll for my tailoring/smithing
needs, I'm itching to get my wizard back into the leveling pool.
However, I still need many backpacks of LQ pelts for plate smithing. So
I'm thinking of taking my wizard to Stonebrunt to hunt the cats. Rumor
has it that they have an excellent drop rate of non-ruined pelts, and I
can bring my large sewing kit and skinning knife to stack up LQ's.

But at level 30, is this doable? Not sure if the mobs might be a bit
high to make it practical. Also, I'll likely be soloing if Tarre isn't
playing there, so is this a good zone for kiting? I have a map, but have
never set foot there with any of my characters. Any tips on good spots
to set up and/or where I can med in peace between pulls?

TIA
