It is now, with so many people in the high levels.

Some assumptions have to be made because we didn't get the whole
story. From what we are told, however, it seems the person left
because they didn't get the loot REGARDLESS of who else might have
deserved it, and an example was given of someone who apparently did
deserve it more, from what we were told.

And yes there's a time when its okay to leave because the loot isn't
being given fairly - it should be obvious when that happens when a
significant portion of the guild disagrees with a decision.

Among guilds with competant leaders and fair systems this *does not
happen*. That's WHY they are competant leaders and the system is being
fairly applied. If you're in a guild where loot arguments always seem
to be happening, the problem is not the system, its the people its
trying to serve.

Sure every guild has one every now and then. But for successful guilds
its not a problem.

You are experienced with different types of guilds than I am. In the
guilds I have been in - the top guilds on two separate servers - there
would have been open revolt if the leadership tried to random stuff.
There would have been people who have been on three raids and in guild
for a month randoming for stuff against people in guild for two years
and on hundreds of raids who need it just as bad.

The real loot whores are those who believe they deserve something just
as much as someone who has put in FAR more time than they have. One
raid doesn't entitle you to anything that drops on it. That's noob
raid crap, good for pickup Fear or Hate raids, not for real raids.

Merit is the best way for long established guilds.

Tell your fellow guildmates to grow up and stop being selfish, or the
leaders to start calling loot fairly then.

Actually, the opposite is true. With merit the druids who come to
first floor Hate will have precedence over those who only showed up to
Fear, to use a long standing example. Not so with random loot.
