Do you understand what 'getting caned' was referring to in his post?

He was not saying that those NGs top posted, he meant that people were 
not tied to a stake and burned alive for top posting, the way people are 
on this NG. if you dont like top posting, kill file us, dont bother 
yelling at us. IF someone had said to me 'would you please not top post' 
instead of flaming me, I most likely would be an intersperse or bottom 
poster. Since I got flamed badly, I will intersperse and top post.

Very good advice Zinph, being nice is better than charging in flames on 
and gets a lot better response from people in getting them to do what 
you want.
