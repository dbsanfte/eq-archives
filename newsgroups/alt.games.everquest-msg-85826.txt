The strategy I've heard is to buy all the cheap items from a slot, and
when it goes empty, you sell the spider silk then.  If it goes into the empty
slot, then the vendor might have more of that item.   So you then buy
back all the silks he has from that same slot.  You may have to click
done and right click the vendor again to be able to buy more than the
one silk.

I haven't tried it yet.
