Well, as long as you're taking this all in stride.

Relax.  I didn't intend that comment as an attack, just stating my own
personal opinion.

I never implied you did.  I never chose to have any of my friends or
family get cancer either.  I wouldn't wish that on anybody.

Heaven forfend somebody have a different outlook on the subject.  But
anyway.

That doesn't change the fact that you chose to be offended, for
whatever reasons.  Valid reasons even, but it's still a choice.

The guy in question, Cancer Tumor, probably picked the name for one of
two reasons.  Number 1, he either thought the name was 'kewl' or even
appropriate for his race class or Number 2, he did it specifically to
be an asshole.  

If its the first reason, then whom ever picked the name is just guilty
of being a bit dim, unimaginative, and a bit insensitive.  If you're
going to be mad at every dim, unimaginative, and insensitive person
there is, well then there isn't enough Prozac in the world to ever
make you happy.  

If 'Cancer' chose his name for the second reason, then this is exactly
the kind of response he want's then.  His whole point is to piss
people off.  There are people out there that live for that, strange
though it may seem.  It has been my experience that the best thing to
do for people like that is to NOT give them what they want.  Pisses
them off to no end, which will make them either escalate until the
self destruct, or they just go away to find other people who will let
them pull their strings.

Either way, it does no good to invest so much of yourself in people
who either simply aren't smart enough to know better or who's lives
are some empty that they can only fill it up with the discomfort of
others.

Game wise, if you feel the name is against the naming rules, report
it.  Quote the chapter and verse if you want to put a point on it.
But don't let people get to you so much.
