	A caster.  If they get caught in melee range and get a resist or two, they
can be beaten to death in seconds.  Unlikely, since a L60 is almost certain to
have SoW or Boots, but it can happen.

	(Velious has Snow Griffins that are RANGERS -- they cast Spirit of Wolf on
themselves and can outrun PCs with SoW or even basic Wolf Form, and they can
root.  Never seen one try to Snare, though.  And they hit harder than Hill
Giants.)
