They don't actually level.  Just kidding there.  But someone who
hunts the way the original author proposed is literally losing
almost half of his exp to his pet, so that a slightly more active
pet handler would level up twice as fast.

It -is- vaguely possible that a pet -does- keep his exp and
could level.  After all, the Monsters project let us run
various mobs which were similar in many ways to pets,
and they could level up, but died permanently when killed
and could not zone or camp out.

Unfortunately, I actually tried this, which you can do as
well.   Create a level one necromancer.  Cast pets till you
get one that is "even con" to you, level one.  Get your pet
a high damage weapon like a rusty halberd, and get him
buffed up by a high level friend so he doesn't die.  Now
let him slaughter his way thru a few dozen newbie mobs
while you refuse to lift a finger.  Con him when you ding 2,
he'll now be blue despite having gotten as much exp as
you by doing more than half the damage.  Now keep at
it, letting him still do all the work.  Ding 3... and find a level
one to con him for you.  You'll find that despite having recieved
enough exp to level from zero to three, he's -still- first level.
Same thing at level 4 which is as far as I got on one pet.

By the time you hit level 4 you have enough exp to level up
from a dead start to level 2 twelve times over... and your
pet has recieved just as much but not leveled.

Either his exp penalty is enourmous or pets just really don't
level up.
