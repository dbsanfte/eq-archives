The trivials at eqtraders are fairly up to date.  They are currently in the
process of putting together a searchable database with all the current
information they have in it.  Not sure what the ETA is on that, but it has
probably caused them to lag behind a bit on updating the information.  Check
out the message boards for eqtraders, people are constantly posting updated
information there.  I know of no better site anywhere for information on all
the tradeskills.  There are a few sites around for some other specific
tradeskills.  www.lokari.net is one of my favorites for tailoring.
