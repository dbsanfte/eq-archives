Do what you enjoy, live with the consequences.  You can solo all the way 
to 60 on any class of character, but its a lot more work than teaming 
up.  If the fun you are having is worth the effort no reason to change.

Kaev mentions missing out on the interaction with others, but from my 
experience one can solo and still interact.  One of my first chars was a 
  paladin sworn to never group for religious reasons.  Despite that fact 
he interacted with more strangers than my group oriented characters 
simply because he was free  to do so.  In a group you are committed to 
the other players, but solo you can drop everything and run off to help 
someone any time you feel the urge.
