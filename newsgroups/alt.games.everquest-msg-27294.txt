I didn't mean you should never med.  And at level 12 you don't gain that
much more mana medding compared to standing.

1) You can med while waiting for the pulls, you can also med while the MOB
is almost dead and doing the death crawl.

2) That means you need to kill quicker, i.e. start swining.

What's the best shaman heal at level 12, 30 points?  That's the same as one
hit from a MOB at that level.

I have a low level cleric and I would sometimes duo with a warrior friend.
We would share the tanking duty, throwing in an occassional DD or stun, and 
if we get a second as long as it's not too tough I would tank it until he's 
done with the first, while healing him or myself when needed.  Doing so I 
would end up with more mana than just healing him.
