That is what it was before the smothing.
The only change that you would see with the numbers above would be that 
58, 59 etc. are now easier so that now 60 = 81% of 59 rather than before 
when it was about 60% of 59. 60 is the same size, it's just that 59 is 
smaller.

I can't imagine that they made 60 proportionally smaller as an added 
"bonus" :-/
