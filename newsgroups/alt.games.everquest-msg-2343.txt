While I have yet to try a bard (I will give it a shot soon), I have heard that
bards are very difficult to play WELL. A bard has the unique ability to song
twist, that is to keep several magic effects going at once by quickly switching
between instruments and songs. Twisting requires non-game skills, such as manual
dexterity on the part of the PLAYER and a good internet connection... if you are
stuck with a 2.88 modem or worse, don't even try to play a bard.

Plus, there is TadghMor's observation. A decent bard is expected to heal the
party AND debuff the mob at the same time; a skillful bard should be able to
heal and buff the party while debuffing the mob. That kind of repeated
hate-listing makes bards EXTREMELY unpopular with the monster set; a grouped
bard is usually the first group member to die.
