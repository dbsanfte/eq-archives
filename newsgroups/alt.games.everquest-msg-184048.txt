This just (and I mean ~just~) happened with my guild, almost exactly as you
describe it.  The original creator of the the guild came back and decided he
wanted the name back.  Our current guildleader spoke to a GM, and sure
enough he had the right ... since he had created the name, it was his
intellectual property, so to speak.

We had a guild meeting by Shady in the EC tunnel, and the other guy showed
up.  A huge stink was raised where he insisted on getting tagged and made an
officer so that he could, in turn, tag a bunch of his cronies and re-take
the guild.

We got around it by disbanding the guild on the spot, waiting a few days,
then re-establishing the current group of folks under a new name.  If the
other guy wanted the name, great ... let him get enough people together to
re-charter a guild with the old name.  By the time he does people will know
us under the new name.  Damn if we're going to let him and his crew sully
the reputation we've all worked so hard to build.

It was a pain in the hindquarters getting everyone re-tagged, and we've
still got some folks to get a tag to (that's how recently this happened),
but it's definitely going to be worth the trouble.  Best of all, this guy's
now completely out of the picture.  Not a dang thing he can do about it.
