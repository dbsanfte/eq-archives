You are a warrior so you want AC above all else
you are a tank.

You don't mention your race but get crafted armor
unless you are an Iksar, iksar can't wear plate and
crafted is plate. Most of the quests will be easy for
you to do.

Get jagged bands for rings.

For earrings get gold topaz, or cougar claw or
orc fang earrings.
