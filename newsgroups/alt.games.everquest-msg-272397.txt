At 19, you're competing with every sage, jeweler and
alchemist out there -- and with everyone who can level
an alt to 10 in tradeskills or wanted to have someone
buy them the book and scribe it themselves.

At 20, it's just alchemists -- and the price skyrockets
with demand from all the people who were making their
own at 19.  Just the wash/oil/resin sells for around 50s a
stack (on Kithicor anyway.)   And you get four stacks for
a stack of roots, 2s40c, and 20 combines.....

And let's not even talk about carbon ink...
