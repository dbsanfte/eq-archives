I'm really ignorant about gear but I can tell you one thing.  You have 205
INT...well, dump 5 of that.  Any INT over 200 is worth ONE mana per INT.

Actually, I've rarely noticed any difference between 190 and 200 so you're
safe getting rid of 15 (as many items as possible that total that).  I think
that if it comes down to that final 10 INT (say 100 mana) you're probably
dead anyway. :)

Jewelers are probably a good first step.  Auction for resist stuff in NFP,
EC, and FV (or anywhere else pretty busy on your server).
