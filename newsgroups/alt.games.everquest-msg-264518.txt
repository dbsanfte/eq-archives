/agree This is THE reason I quit the game. I had an Illusion/Radiation 
Controller and on my last day, had a Blaster follow me around and 
after I had disposed of minor gang members and started in on the Boss, 
the Blaster would wipe him out in a few shots and I received little or 
no xp. I petitioned, and the answer was "You have no reason to 
petition, you received some xp" I logged then and there, terminated my 
account and have never regretted it. I probably would have quit 
eventually, but would have given it another month or two. As it 
stands, they got their usually small percentage of the game sale 
price, but no subscription revenue, as I quit within the free period.
