No wait a second there, Ragazzo: Make-ah that a nice-ah order of spaghet,
only
this-ah time pour the sauce on the spaghetti instead of scooping it by the
handful and splattering it all over the computer screen only to stand there
calling it "Bob Pastorio's opinions and point of view."  Okay?  My god what
a mess.

Now, I can't say for sure since this is your area of expertise and none of
mine, but just try for the first time in your life to be honest, try to deal
honestly with the questions at hand without drowning every bit of flavor
under all those greasy draughts of vituperative olive oil, to which you
always want to add the ad hominem meatballs in goat-cheese sauce.  In other
words try to keep yourself, Pastorio, the Big-ah Fat-ah Hairy Meatball,
itself out of the creation, as you for the first time try hard to prepare a
dish of arguments by just holding all the stink of  garlic and onion, and
then the actual pure flavor of straight discourse can come through, just for
once.  And besides, like I say this is not my area of knowledge, it is all
yours:  you are the Big Hairy Chef, and I am the fine, the sensitive
aesthete, the Thinker and Writer (as any fool not eaten alive by his own
narcissism can plainly see)--two completely different areas of knowledge and
craft, you must admit, there, Chef, but still, from the standpoint of a
layman in culinary matters, IMHO, I thought those meatballs were a Swedish
invention, but there you are.

There you are.

So now I'm thinking your name is not "Pastorio" at all but maybe something a
lot more like Sven Lutefiskinsen, which is nothing to be ashamed of, some of
my best friends are Scandinavian, for example, Thor Heyerdahl, who although
I never met him personally, knowing the affinity between his outlook and
mine which doesn't give an inch to the conceits of Academe, well then he and
are truly buddies and fellow sea-farers of the heart from way back.  Then of
course, there's my in-laws in Minnesota--but that's another story.

Is that right?  Is the truth now come out at last?  You are a rice-filled
Swedish Meatball?

Good Night.  The next thing you know it won't be just a saucy Meatball like
this sprouting legs, getting up  and walking around, trying to pass itself
off as a rationally speaking human being but it'll be big creamy scoops of
Spumoni, and bottles of Valpolicella pretending to dance and sing arias from
La Traviata, let alone talk politics!
