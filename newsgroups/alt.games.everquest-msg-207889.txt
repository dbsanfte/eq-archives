Ack, focus, run and hide run and hide!

Did he cast focus yet?

Ack, I came back over just in time for the focus!

SOW, on the other hand, is at worst a mild speed bump unless I'm 
actively engaged in a foot race or pulling something faster than SOW 
like a snow griffin, and normally is the best possible buff you could 
cast on me. 

Seriously, what would a bard like better than the ability to run faster 
than mobs without needing to keep singing selos.  HP buff?  Bard is a 
non contact sport.  Mana buff?  Don't make me laugh (or cry) bards are 
immune to mana regen buffage.  Dex buff?  Did I mention that bards are 
primarily non contact... dex would help proc but for that I'd have to 
swing a weapon!  DS? (ahem).  I'll tell you what comes to mind... SOE.  
Longer duration and I can stop clicking the damn 10 minute boots for 
lev; I need the leve because a 50 in safe fall just doesn't cut it when 
constantly running over rough terrain.

Now if I'm a bard in a hurry, my favorite buff would have to be DMF, 
because its a long duration lev without interfering with selos... if you 
think I complain about the falling damage adding up while on TBoot or 
SOW, you should see me cursing the designer who thought giving a class 
with "ludicrous speed" no Safe Fall... only the fact that my bard is a 
Vah Shir gives me even that 50 points!
