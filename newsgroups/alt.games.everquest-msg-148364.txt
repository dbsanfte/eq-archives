Why do you care if manufacturers can't make them at a high success rate?
What matters to us is bang for the buck.

As far as not being able to see them from an angle...I was looking at my friend's
new laptop the other day and found that I was able to watch a movie playing on it at an angle
of about 45 degrees off center with very little fading.  So the displays have gotten a lot
better, but I'm sure you have a pay the price for a display with better characteristics.

Several things appeal to me about flat panel displays... they're smaller, lighter weight,
lower power, never go out of focus or out of adjustment (other than contrast).  The newer ones with
the DVI connection ensure that you don't get ringing or other artifacts that are associated
with analog video connections.  As far as I know, there are no issues with screen burnout
(unlike CRTs).

I wish I had one of them 16:9 wide screen flat panel displays.  Sweet!
