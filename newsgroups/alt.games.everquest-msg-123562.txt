Being there when Rage spawns gives you a head start in the
race.  often that head start will be enough.  If the camper has
a raid camped with him or, pre-positioned for him that will
indeed give the head start.

In addition, if several clerics are all keeping an eye out for
Rage they will often become friendly, friendly enough that the
one who spots rage first gets a "congrats" or a "darn" from the
others rather than a "gentlemen start your engines"

The original poster missed the point entirely, of course.  The
camp was not enforced, instead the GM used their default
decider for when two groups are both ready to attack a
thingie.  Roll to see who goes first.
