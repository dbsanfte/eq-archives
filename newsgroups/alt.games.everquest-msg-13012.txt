Hold onto it.  It once only dropped from Cazic Thule himself, but now drops off his
Golems.  It's a really cool item to have.  The skel illusion is especially good for
you because it will make you less massive for those tight dungeons.  And above all
else, it's the coolness factor of it.  A Paladin in my guild recently got one, and
he loves to run around in Skel form while holding his epic in his hand.
