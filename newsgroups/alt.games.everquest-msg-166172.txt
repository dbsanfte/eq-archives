I've been in many many groups that had neither chanter or shaman, as a cleric.  And
I've seen groups decide not to go places because they had neither.  Do an /who lfg
at odd hours in PoT and you might be surprised to discover that there aren't always
members of every class sitting around LFG, particularly key classes like this...
they get snapped right up.  Look for "level appropriate" members for a group in the
low to mid 50s in PoT and you might be even more surprised, people this low level
tend to not come to PoP at all, probably due to the "60+" exclusionism thats so
rife there.  Since they won't be likely to get a group, they don't come at all.
Even using /who all lfg, you'll find many members in that target level range are
reluctant to come to PoP out of a perhaps justified fear that they'll spend all
their time waiting on bodies in the graveyard.

I wouldn't say staggering at all.  Less than 50% chance, perhaps I'd grant you.
However, the group I was in had neither, so it doesn't seem astonishingly poor
odds.
