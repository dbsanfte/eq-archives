My EQ running with everything turned on, everything set to high, etc 
uses less than 600MB of RAM. The OS and other stuff I've got running 
uses another 250ish (and that's with me running quite a bit in the 
background)... 1GB is already more than enough for EQ.

I'd say you probably wasted your money if that's the only reason you 
bought it. Fortunately RAM is cheap at least so it wasn't a big waste.

Depends on the raid configuration. Provided you setup for performance, 
and not redundancy two 40s should be faster, but your controller card is 
really generally as important as the actual the drives for RAID 
performance... the IDE RAIDs that are built onto a lot of motherboards 
really shine for redundancy, where the data is mirrored on both drives. 
Its not really all that special when striping for performance though.

One of those 10k rpm drives is probably your best performance value for 
your money. And/or placing your windows pagefile on a fast independant 
hard drive (ie not part of a raid) may also make a difference. But 
really, if your game is swapping to and from the hard disk during play 
its going to lag... hard drive speed vs ram speed is several orders of 
magnitude....

But really HD performance is primarily relevant only for zoning time 
(provided you have enough RAM), and is again not usually a really 
significant EQ bottleneck in a higer end system. Matched high-end CPU 
and GPU are the most important EQ related considerations, once 
everything else reaches "adequate". [And this is true for all games, 
really]
