Patenting of gene sequences from animals and plants, these are 
discoveries and not inventions. A drug using these sequences, possibly, 
but not in such a way as to stop a better drug being designed. all 
Software patents, things such as Amazon's 1 click shopping, software has 
copyright protection anyway. BT tried to lay claim to a patent on 
hyperlinks. Go and read some of the patents that have been granted by 
the US patent office.

The only people who get rich from patents are lawyers, since patent 
protection is all about "I sue you, you counter sue me". So every time 
you buy a patent protected item, think about the lawyer tax involved in 
defending that patent added to the cost of the item. That is not money 
that is being re-invested in business and creating jobs, unless you are 
a banker in the Caymans of course.
