Well, being able to find a camp that doesn't need evac and can still
give reasonable XP at 57 would  be nice. There are about 5 on all of
Norrath and they are constantly either full or fodder for AOE groups.

Being able to take newer guild members who have done EC-> WC-> NRo->
Oasis-> LOIO-> Overthere -> DL -> KC -> Velk's and never seen how a
real, experienced dungeon group works together some place in Chardok
without having to worry that a TPW will mean hours of CR would be
nice.

Of course, giving moon-based port spells to the wizards and druids
would help a lot, too.
