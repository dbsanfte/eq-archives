If your internet service provider is AOL, ditch them for AT&T or some
other REAL ISP.

If you have multiple lines in your house they could be interfering
with each other.  Open a bandwidth monitoring program and use one of
your alternate lines to make a call (or ask someone to call you on
those lines) If you notice lag spikes that's the problem.

If the disconnects happen at regular intervals try updating your ISP's
client software.

If you have a software firewall running be sure to give the everquest
process download AND upload permissions (although this may be a
problem due to Verant's robbing us of Alt-Esc)

If you are behind a hardware firewall, you might need to configure it
accordingly.

That's just the programmers at Verant having fun.  One of my personal
favorites is:  "You have become better at loading (12)"

>Thank you much in advance.

Your welcome.
