yeah, you should remake your rogue...dump all your points into str because
that's really all that matters.  rogues are not tanks.  don't ever get
confused about that one.  the class exists in order to be the highest dmg
melee class...at 55 with epic and double backstab, the highest dmg class of
all.  in a game where str impacts both dmg and your chance to hit, that's
what you need (str = higher attack raiting...not dex)  also, start setting
aside cash to buy the highest dmg primary piercer you can afford.  something
around 5k will set you up with a jagged ice shard, thunder rune war spear,
crys spear etc....some 12 or 13dmg spear that will lay out a nice 300 pt
backstab by your mid 40s before you can get your epic.  nuff said.
