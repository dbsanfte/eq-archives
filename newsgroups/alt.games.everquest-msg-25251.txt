I had to find out the hard way too.. wasted a bunch of mana.

Basically, as castersrealm.com states in the description of the spell's use,
it's a point blank DD meaning the MoB has to be with in attack range to
become effective. Works great if you have more than one MoB on you at a
time. Give it a try.. Go tap something and try to cast. If you're successful
you should take a few HP from the MoB.
