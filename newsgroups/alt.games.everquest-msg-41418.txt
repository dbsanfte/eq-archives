I think this palestinian thing is being blown way out of proportion.
On the photos and TV shots I've seen, there were a couple of dozen
people in the streets, mostly kids.  It was also quite obvious that
were mostly acting for the TV cameras.  Don't underestimate
palestinian dislike of the US, but if you looked closely at those
shots you would also see quite a lot of adults in the background
looking with disgust at the celebrations.
