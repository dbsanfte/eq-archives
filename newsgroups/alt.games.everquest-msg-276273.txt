As a major EQ1 fan, I'd actually suggest WoW having finally been drawn 
into playing it...I find it to be that little bit closer to the EQ1 
style than EQ2 is. Not meaning to cause any flamewars as I also really 
like EQ2 (and knowing the lore of Norrath, EQ2 has that little extra 
place in my heart), but it's just my experience that while WoW is a bit 
cartoonish and simplistic in places, it's also a lot like EQ1 in the 
places that count to me (the mechanics of mobs, the freedom of 
exploration, the freedom in grouping and also the way players can 
interact and aren't restricted in aiding total strangers)
