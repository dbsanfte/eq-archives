The enormous negative repurcussions from the slave trade, and the
consistent effort by the slave-holding sub-culture to destroy and
cripple families and other social structures among the slaves,
and the continued oppression and discrimination against former

slaves and their descendants (which has not been entirely eliminated

to this day), continue to echo strongly in America.

- The reparations idea is, IMO, one of the many stupid things to come
out of the thread of "victimology" running through our culture today,
too many lawyers and too many people too eager to get a handout.
- Improved access to education and employment opportunities is, again
IMO, appropriate where an existing disadvantage (due to injustice or
other racially discriminatory behavior) can be shown.  Given that so
much of everything here in America is dependent on wealth, and that
the disadvantages of minority persons are often ascribed largely to
the denial of access to the means of acquiring wealth, it seems to me
that most of that particular issue can be addressed purely in terms
of relative wealth (i.e. make sure poor folk of any racial or ethnic
background have reasonable access to education).  Racial preferences
are kissing cousins to racial quotas, and their implementation sure
looks to have fostered dependency, irresponsibility, and laziness
among their beneficiaries while promoting resentment among those who
are not amongst the favored.  But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be
creating programs designed to benefit disadvantaged minorities, it just
means that I think it's just as stupid to gate access to those programs
with a racial "litmus test" as it was to tolerate the racist behavior
that created the disadvantages in the first place.
- I see no justification for economic action based directly on events
beyond living memory (thus my opposition to the reparations idea), but
I do see a need for continuing action to redress the grievances and
mitigate the unjust disadvantages of people who are with us today.

Finally, denying the existence of the problems and relying on
sophmoric "wit" to make your points as "Jeff George" has done
is not going to convince me to respect your position.
