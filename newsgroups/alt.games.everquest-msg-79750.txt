Hmm a tad harsh I feel, But then we were doing it for "The Experience"tm.
Two short but hardy fighters standing nose to toe with a mighty foe - the
clash of steel, the hiss of blades biting into flesh and at the end Honour
for all. The worth of a Halfling can be measured by the stature of his
vanquished opponents. etc etc.

 But I know that just makes me an idiot in most players eyes. - but it is
fun :)

I must thank everyone for the info, we had another crack at it lastnight,
but the gods were not kind - got buffed and stood about primed for action,
waited for ages eventualy saw a giant appear only for some stinky druid to
nab him! Grr. Partner weent LD and I got fed up..heyho..next time :)

Naddo - Halfling of Steel (now a proud member of HomeGrownHeros)
