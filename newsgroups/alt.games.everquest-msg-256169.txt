As a melee, I find I'm in a sort of a bind (no pun intended).
Currently I'm bound in a corner of the bank in PoK.  That's
the most efficient for me when I have no idea where I'm going
to be grouped: I can grab a SOW potion or other CR gear from
the bank and take off.  If I join an LDoN, I just hope there's
a rezzer in the party or I try real hard not to die.  (Feign
death helps a lot with that. :-)  If I took your advice and
rebound at the LDoN camp (or at the site), that's fine for if
I need to run back, but after the adventure I have to beg a
bind from someone back in PoK.

My monk really envies my alts' ability to bind themselves any
place they like.  Of course, they envy my monk's ability to
feign death.  They keep practicing it, but so far all they've
mastered is the real thing. :-)
