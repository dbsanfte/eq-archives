These are indeed quite nice.  Not only are my alts enjoying them, they
also give a bit of purpose to liven up the grind.  I'd love to see
more quests like this added.   Don't forget to keep your eyes peeled
for the augment drops!

Also, all of the past hotzones still have their special drops, just
not the XP boost any longer.  Even if you can't use the drop, they
often sell well to vendors.  In the previous round of hotzones
(Grieg's End, Old Sebilis, Chardok, etc.) any mob in the zone had a
very small chance (1%-ish?) to morph into an "unmasked changeling" at
50% HP and drop an aug.  These tended to alternate between either
+mana/end or +HP augs, with a few exceptions.  If you are lacking
augments, this is a cheap way to get some at low levels.  Even Kurn's
Tower can give you (AC:+2, HP:+5). :)  The cost, of course, is the low
drop rate.

All classes have yummy armor from Blightfire, not just hybrids.
Warriors get effects like Attack and HP Regen, and Shaman get focus
effects (Spell Haste, etc.) and Mana Regen, for example.  I suggest
looking it over and deciding which pieces you want for which
character.  My iksar necromancer would have loved the boots with mana
regen, but I can't realistically acquire Burning Affliction II on
anything other than Kobold Hide Boots (the common BA2 bracer from
Lower Guk is not iksar wearable).

I've never yet made the run through Fungus Grove.  That's a quick
teleport to Twilight Sea, but I usually go the other way.  PoK book to
Shadeweaver's Thicket, through Shar Vahl, Hollowshade Moor, and into
Grimling Forest.  You won't meet anything nastier than mid-20's or so,
so far.  Past the outpost in Grimling Forest, just run invisibly to
the zoneline to Tenebrous Mountains.  There are a few mobs in
Tenebrous that see invis, so this is a bit dicier.  With invis, a bit
of care, and a run speed buff you should make it through OK.  Two
cautions: Katta Castellum does NOT like dark races.  (On the other
hand, my troll loved hunting guards here, once upon a time...)  Also,
levitation does not work in Katta Castellum.  That means, when you see
the long ramp leading down to the bank area, and are tempted to
blindly levitate and float down, you will go splat.  (I think levitate
spells will be dispelled on entry and be unable to complete casting,
but I forget.)  Just carefully follow the path down/up.  As a bonus,
I've frequently found the grimling runner (for the Rallic Pack drop)
in Tenebrous not only uncamped, but on Track. Bring his drop to KC,
hand it to Rallic, and you can either finish crafting the pack or sell
the pattern.  Heck, I'd recommend hunting the western grimling cave in
Tenebrous to anyone around 39-42 or so - nice money, a shot at the
runner, albeit an empty zone.  Anyway, you can decide if this route
sounds like more or less hassle than via Fungus Grove.

Good hunting!
