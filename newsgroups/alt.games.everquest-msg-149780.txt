But why in Brell's name would you get dropped off in DL? Get a ride
to Misty Thicket, or GFay, depending on class. Run in, do your business,
get a ride back to EJ with your porter who came along with you... cause
its not far and its not a big deal and he knew you didn't want to walk
all the way back to seb.

Aye, this was more painful.  Port to DL run to Karnors.  But it no
longer applies, and we are talking about how to do things now.

Your problems here still stem from not grouping with porters.  Ports
are a healthy portion of what the porting classes bring to the table,
any sensible porter offers utility ports at the end of a camp, as well
as the initial "get the party together and bring them to the zone" ports..
oh and "get dead people together if needed for CR" ports.  Nine
times out of ten if you go somewhere Hoping for a port, begging or
paying, you would have found  it faster to walk.

Nothing in particular, but you can't claim to be doing things the most
efficient way, when your way involves walking the face of norrath unsowed
even though there are perfectly good porters you could have included in
your  groups.

No, if you said "I didn't have one of the most useful pieces of equipment
in the game because I couldn't afford it" at 40, or MAYBE even at 45,
I could see it.  But there's no excuse for someone who is hunting in
Seb, a money rich environment, not sparing the <5K pp for TBoots by
level 50, much less 51, 52, 53, 54 54 54 (hell level) and all the way
to 55?  OK, nowadays I can see blowing it off if you do 51 51 51
instead and get yourself run 3.  My cleric was "twinked" with a set
of banded, other than that was my highest level character (and still is)
and nonetheless had TBoots by 35, because they are the key to self
sufficiency, or to allowing me to group with partners who can't cast
SOW.
