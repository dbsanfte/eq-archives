I have heard they do exist.  Only one per class per server is available and
most/all them were found many years ago and the chars that had them were
either retired or they have a new main.  I'm pretty sure the guild leader of
Skyfire on my server has the shaman one. I'm told this from a RL friend in
the guild, but he no longer plays his shaman anymore.
