Agree .. let's not get too far away from why this poll and its'
ultimate result for SOE.

This is a marketing exercise plain and simplke with a little
communication thrown in for good measure.  This could be the business
process that went into it:

Issue:  People are leaving the games in droves.

Solution:

1.  Have a summit to show we are being open with the current player
base. (Pity it failed on that).

2.  Give out a "buddy key" to current players with the aim of
attracting new customers.  (They forgot that most players are so
disaffected atm they would not pass this on to their friends if their
life depended on it).

3.  Facilitate sales of accounts so if we lose one player we gain
another. (This is quite a clever one .. even the disaffected players
may see some return for the years of effort)

4.  Setup a poll system on the servers to show we are being open about
our communication. (As Remington pointed out and I did earlier in this
thread we don't see the results of these polls ... one way
communication is not good).
