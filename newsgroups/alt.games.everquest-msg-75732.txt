> Rivervale is where you go if you want to be begged from.

Alas, you are right.  I hadn't returned to my home city for nearly 10
seasons and the first thing I get upon returning is a tell demanding I give
him 5pp for his spells cause I'm a fellow hairyfeet and have lots of money
(level 21).  Exact tell was "I need to buy my level 9 spells so give me 5pp
brother...you must have lots of dough".  I fear for the tourism economy in
our great town.  I apologize to everyone for the acts of my fellow
halflings.
