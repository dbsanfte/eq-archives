Sheesh.  How can Verant keep overlooking
obvious "side effects" of new items/abilities
like this?

On the other hand, I can partially understand
it in this case.  I wouldn't have thought of
a Velium Bar to be a "reagent" of the Enchant
Velium spell, since the spell acts "on" the
Velium Bar and changes it to something else.
It's only the fact that the coders shoehorned
the "Enchant X" (and "Imbue X") into the
game via the "reagent" process that makes
this a problem for the new "conserve reagents"
ability.  Enchant/Imbue could have, and perhaps
should have, been coded using a different process.
