If there is one thing they haven't improved about eq2 it is the fun factor
of crafting. They have made it more profitable, sure, put in more recipes
(most of which as a sage i'll never use because by the time i got the rares,
they'd be very grey, so i just buy dropped adepts and i expect i'll buy
master 1's and never craft them). They haven't made it involving, or
interesting. Poking keys in response to random events feels dull and there's
certainly enough crafters macroing their way to 50 to prove that if xp is
what you want, then the process is mindless.

So what can be done? Are there other mmogs where the process is more
interesting? I had more fun in SWG crafting but less in EQ1, and although i
played WOW a bit, i never got into it deeply enough to be able to comment on
the crafting. Are there ideas to improve crafting that could be copied from
other games?

comments largely negatively on the changes, and i'd have to admit, when it
comes time to craft, i find excuses not to play, which is a bad thing from
the devs perspective. Yet the devs seem to be pushing adventurers to greater
dependency on crafters. If suggests to the devs could be made on improving
the crafter's job, then perhaps it wouldn't be such a frightful grind and
people would not be as apprehensive of this change.
