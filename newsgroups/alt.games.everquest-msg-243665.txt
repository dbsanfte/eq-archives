I am starting to think he's a troll. He skirted the Godwin on that post 
very nicely, never once actually *saying* N*zi or Hitl*r.

Anyone that can't understand the disconnect between reality and a game 
(and, for that matter, that that is the *whole point* of an RPG) and 
instead thinks highly of oily ways to bilk customers of their hard earned 
lettuce is irrevocably stuck with their head up their ass.
