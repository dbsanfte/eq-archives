Well usually silver will not be bought all that often, since in most
instances platinum makes the same location of jewelry just better stats.
Generally gold will be prefered over electrum since again it will make
better stat jewelery in the same location as electrum. There are some
exceptions at the higher end where the electrum makes on set of stats and
the gold will make the revers, like with sapphire is makes either
+2str/+4int or +4str/+2int depending on which enchanted bar you use.

For velium, I personally stay away from it, it geenrally only provides one
extra point over platinum and IMO not worth the extra chance of failure
compounded with the additional cost of the velium bar which is about dbl a
plat bar.

Also you might want to investigate the imbued jewelcraft, this makes some
pretty nice items depending on the imbued gem used. You do not have to
follow the god of the imbued jem to make the jewelcraft items.

www.eqtraders.com will be your friend in the pursuit of jewelcraft
information.
