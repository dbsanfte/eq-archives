   Yikes!  I also have never heard of sig simply just poofing like that.  I
knew that I had included it because when I post, it is automatically pasted
onto the bottom right where I can see it.  I routinely have to modify it
when I post to other newsgroups (when I remember too, that is).  Thanks for
reposting it, Lance, for those that might not be seeing it.

   And Zach, you read the entire thing?  In one sitting?  Congratulations,
you now know more about the game then better of half of the player base, by
my humble estimations.  Reward yourself with some Visine!
