A good cleric does not have a hard time healing while being
beat on; once channeling skill gets up over 120 or so, a cleric
with good AC (clerics are a Plate armor class) and maxed
defense and dodge can easily cast with one or two mobs pounding
away at him.  A cleric's main function is to keep the main tank
alive... but job one is to keep the enchanter alive if you have one,
as one dead tank does not make for a dead party, while having
your enchanter die often does.

The primary job of the shaman is to slow the target, so that it does
less damage while you fight it.

Due to the Lich line of spells, necromancers usually have plenty of
mana even if there is no enchanter in the group to keep them in
clarity.

Job one of the enchanter is to keep the cleric alive, if he is forced to
pick
someone to get the mobs off of first.  Anyone else in the party dies, the
cleric can ressurect them back after the fight, but if the cleric dies you

may be in for quite a long CR effort... Also, clerics do so much better
a job of healing (I'll leave the arguement about a level 60 shaman with
a very rare spell aside) in general that losing him may mean losing the
whole group.

Up thru the fourties, a mage's principle contribution to the group is
his pet.  The pet, well handled, functions as a secondary tank,
laying down significant damage, serving as a damage sponge
with excellent hp regeneration, and rarely gets in too much trouble.
Mages can heal their pets, and groups have been built around a
hollow shell, no tank or ranger/monk tank, just the mage(s) pet.
In the post 50 game, though, pet control tends to become so difficult
that there are situations where the mage will literally not summon
one.  Instead of a decent tank -and- a semi-wizard nuker, the mage
suddenly starts contributing only half his normal capablity.

Wizards can also snare and stun, both very important functions in a fight,

although often functions that are covered by other party members.  Their
principle function is causing damage to shorten a fight, their main job
is to not overdo this and get aggro or overly deplete their mana supply,
as they must have mana available to end bad fights with massive overkill
nuking, or Evacing the party out.
