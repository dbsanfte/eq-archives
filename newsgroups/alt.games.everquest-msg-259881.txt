This isn't -my- definition of kill stealing.

Its how kill stealing works in EQ, at least if you play by the PNP, I'll 
grant you.

To -me- Kill Stealing is taking a mob that belongs to someone else and 
getting the credit for it.

A fine hair splitting difference, to be sure, but one that might make a 
difference in whether there's something to complain about or not.

In EQ, we quite frequently have spawn sites where you have to kill a 
Place Holder again and again, each time with a small chance that the 
desired rare will spawn.

If someone shows up after several hours of you killing that spawn, just 
as the rare spawns, and manages to quickly hit it with any sort of 
damage, then he "owns" it according to the PNP.  In my book, he's stolen 
it, though, because I and 99% of the people I've ever talked to or 
observed playing EQ follow "camp etiquette", and recognize that that 
spawn "belongs" to the person who's sat there for the past several hours 
creating chances for it to happen.

All this WoW mechanic seems to do is to enforce the PnP that Verant 
already has in place; I suppose thats a positive step, but it looks to 
me like it only encourages people to act like asses, secure in the 
knowledge that their behavior is going to be enforced by the game 
mechanics; worse than the way things are in EQ where these same few 
flaunt public opinion and fall back on the PnP as an excuse.
