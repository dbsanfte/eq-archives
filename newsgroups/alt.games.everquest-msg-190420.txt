Yes, well sort of ...

Many classes are able to cast sight-improving spells, spells such as ...

Serpent sight
Deadeye
Ultravision
Shifting sight

you can also pick up items with worn effects which help alot.

also check you have the lighting effects turned on (in the options before
you login) or it could be like the other poster said your clip plane.
I always thought my clip plane was broken as it never seemed to make any
diffrence where I put it I was always at 100% until I discovered I had to
drag the clip plane to 0% then back to 100% before finally settling at
whatever percentage I wanted for it to take effect.

Hope that helps.
