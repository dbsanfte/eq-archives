Little Andrew here posted in support of topposting, and claimed that
this was the only group he subscribed to that didn't have top posting
as default.

He was shown to be wrong. He has since resorted to "ignoring" everyone
who throws the evidence in his face.

Andrew is a sad little man who is so insecure he cannot bear the fact
he's wrong.

Right. Everyone is wrong except Andrew, and if anyone else thinks
otherwise, they must be wrong too!

Sad little man.

How is that obvious at all, Andrew?

You have shown no evidence of such so far.

In other words, his argument got slapped down like the pitiful thing
it was and now he's bawling about it.

Other than that making no sense whatsoever (so much for YOUR English),
no one resorted to cursing, and you never proved anyone wrong. You
just ran like the coward you are.

Btw, you're still a shitstain.

You are not one to be calling others on errors, you pitiful little
wretch.

When someone resorts to calling someone on a typo you know they've
lost.

Maybe if you ignore everyone who thinks you're a tard you will have a
nice quiet newsgroup to yourself.

What a maroon.

Still waiting on those newsgroups that prefer topposting, you lying
wretch.
