Not necessarily talking about a FPS type game. RTS, simulation, turned-based,
etc. would work too.

Well for a skill-based PvP-centric game to work:

1. You will die ALOT. The game would have to have only a minor death pentalty,
or people would get fustrated and quit.

2. The game pace would have to SLOWED down to rule out the ping-time
advantage. It's not an action game--it's a skill and strategy game.

3. You are right that LAG death will happen. See points 1 & 2.

4. Level differences can't be such a huge factor. You level 30 will have an
advantage over my level 15, but I should have more than a snowflake's in Hell
chance to win.
