From what I have read once you yell for help you get zero xp and loot.  Now
I do not know if a higher char can beat it down to 5% and then unlock it
allowing you to finish but I wouldn't doubt if the new aggressor gets
nothing if the mob is below 50%.  With some of the lengths they seem to be
going I would not doubt a provision that at least scales the xp down
accordingly.

You cannot land anything on an engaged mob or the PC if you are not in the
group.  It reads almost as if it's an "instanced" encounter with third
parties being observers unless it is unlocked.
