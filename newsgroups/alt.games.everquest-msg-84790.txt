    In the first case, by having planned days to do "spur of the moment"
activites the guildy in question never needs /gu on. You don't HAVE
spur-of-the-moment activities on non-planned days where you expect everyone
to come. If the Tangrin pops and your ENCH needs him, you resign yourself to
the fact that the guild isn't dropping whatever they want to do individually
that day to come help drop him.

    In the second case, when you have all guild members grouped, inevitably
ONE of them will have /gu on and can tell the others "time to hit the road!"
Otherwise there couldn't be too much blather, could there? :-)
