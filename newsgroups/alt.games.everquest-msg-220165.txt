Originally I thought they were raising ZEM on underutilized dungeons. Higher
ZEM was a good way to entice players to make the longer trip to more
difficult zones like The Hole, HS and PaW. How they ever decided put a high
ZEM on Paludal and LOIO makes no sense to me. These are newbie zones right
next to a town and should be a low ZEM in my opinion.
