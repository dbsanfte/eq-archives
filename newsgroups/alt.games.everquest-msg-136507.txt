Affliction: Haste, Efficiency, Extended.....   yes I understand
dot's... .  So as a:
 Druid, is it all my dot's that last more than 36 seconds?  or is it
just certain line of dots?
As a Necro,is it all my dot's that last more than 36 seconds?  or is
it just certain line of dots?
Yes I do understand about he level limitation depending on what
version of Focus you have (I, II, III).

now on this line of thought:
Mana Preservation  - Reduces mana cost of all spells except Complete
Heals..  Does this work on DoT's? the description does not delimit
them out, but in Efficiency for Affliction it already does this.

as usual thanks for your input and time.
