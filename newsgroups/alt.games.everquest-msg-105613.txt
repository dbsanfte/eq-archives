Depending on your race alignments and your knowledge of the game.
I highly recommend the Warrens. Great exp. and Great loot for the level.
Getting there and getting a bind my be a problem if you are KoS.
Don't forget to turn in the kobold molars for faction exp and cash in either
Paineel or Erudin.
