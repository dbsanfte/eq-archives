A shame when you go into the game to take a virtual vacation from the real
world, and some jackass insists on bringing the real world in there too.
Worse yet, that the dumbshit would refer to jews as pollution.  I am not
jewish, but I do firmly believe you are God's people, and that the
friendship between America and Israel benefits the former more than the
latter.  It is surely a controversial belief.  But that's OK with me.  Where
we go with Israel, we go with God, and will never be subdued.

I grew up in the Los Angeles area.  It's hard to explain what a madhouse
that place is.  I'll be honest, I'm surprised wackos don't go into LAX
shooting at least once a week.  Some of them have an irrational hatred of
jews, some of blacks, some of whites, and so on.  You'll find it all in
southern California.  Maybe that's part of why I left . . .

As you certainly should be.
