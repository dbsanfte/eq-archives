I can't imagine that Bertoxx is that different from EMarr as far as rangers
are concerned.  I am in a guild of part time players, we all have lives away
from EQ, including such things as jobs, college, families.  There are
players in the guild ranging up to level 60.  Current highest level ranger
is 58 or 59.  None of the rangers ever have trouble getting a group, much
like no other players generally do.  Rangers are great to group with, they
put out a lot of damage, and can take a decent amount, all ranger jokes
aside.
