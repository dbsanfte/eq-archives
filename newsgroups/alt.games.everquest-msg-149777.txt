You are right and its a real shame, lost interest in my war at level
54 just was not having fun with it any longer. Expensive  buggers too.
So like everyone else, or so it seems, I started a monk and a necro.
Both are a real blast and the monk dinged 54 last night with no signs
of getting bored with the char. Necro is pretty much the same although
the research is a pain. 

To each his own and good thing some people enjoy playing warriors but
frankly verant has screwed em. In all the push to keep clerics happy,
warriors are getting fewer every day, class balancing lol right.
