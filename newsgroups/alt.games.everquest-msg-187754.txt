I use it, and he is killed quite nicely but alas, the more people who 
reply to him, the more of his posts I see.  So he may post only once, 
but the replies are 20 fold.

Its just annoying, just when I think I have got rid of them, *sigh* more 
people start replying.

Honestly my kill filter *ONLY* has white prophet and those that have 
replied.  And its pretty full......getting fuller every day.
