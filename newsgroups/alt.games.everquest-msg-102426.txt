Quite simple to do even if youre KOS.
Just need to follow 5 easy steps:

Step 1. Make SURE someone kill the ogre in the hut behind Oowomp, it can 
make your quest rather nasty. Usually not a problem since hes camped, so 
just need to kill the ogre while Oowomp is away.

Step 2. Make a deal with whoever are camping Oowomp, so its not killed 
before youre done with it.

Step 3. Sneak around the hut, and sneak up to Oowomp from behind. FD 
optional.

Step 4. Give Oowomp the 5 gp, and the skelly spawns.

Step 5. Talk to skelly and do quest.
