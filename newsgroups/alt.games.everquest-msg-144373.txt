I have been playing my necro off and on, but have just developed a passion
for him.  Just dinged 44 and decided to try to find out why i haven't had
any specialization skill increases in forever.  I started with a point in
each, and decided to go with the one that went over 50 first - my money was
on alteration.

Last time I noticed, both alteration & conjuration were close to 50, but not
over.  I went to visit a trainer, to end the race and debate.  Low and
behold, my evocation is at 51.  WTF???  Not sure how it happened, but not my
first or even second choice as a necro.  Anyone have any info on the quest
to reset?

TIA
