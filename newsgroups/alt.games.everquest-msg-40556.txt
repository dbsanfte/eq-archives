Anyone else notice that falls resulting in high damage seem to be increasing
at the WC ring?

I play on the Seventh Hammer, and  have never received damage from a fall at
that ring in numerous self ports there. Tonight I fell for 524 once which
made me pass out, as I only have 524 HPs with my buffs up... thats not a
typo, I would have thought I'd have died with 0 hps, but I didn't. It did
hurt like hell though =)

About 2 hours later I fell for 350 at the same spot. Both times I ported
from high up on the wall in the Overthere, and I'm beginning to wonder if my
starting altitude may have some effect, or maybe it's if other people are
standing on the port spawn point at the WC druid ring?

Is it just my night for bad luck, or is this becoming more common?
