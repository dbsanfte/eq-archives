Oh, come on now.  Look, I agree with you that it's stupid and sloppy
of them to provide a "Game Updates" page that is so badly out of date.
I agree that just because they post the information on the forums is
no excuse for leaving up an unmaintained page like that.

But after that, I think you're over-reacting.  Okay, so the information
posted above the coffee-maker -- er, on the forums -- didn't include any
details about what's in the patch.  That could be laziness or sloppiness,
or it could be deliberate.  (I expect at least part of the reason for the
patch is to plug whatever exploit was letting people dup containers, and
they might not like discussing such exploits, especially before they're
plugged.)

And yes, we all know the Server Status page is also misleading, because
it shows servers as up even if they're really locked while they test out
the patch.  (Oops, sorry, I forgot.  They don't test.  Not at all.  Ever.
Just like I never feed my cats.  Ever.  Just ask them.)

And as for now saying what's going on now, well duh!  They already posted
that there'd be a patch at 5, for five hours, servers expected up at 10.
So at 9 you expect them to say what?  "Yes, we still expect the servers
to be up at 10?"  How about, "If you want to know when the servers are
expected to be up, reread what was already posted?"

Now, if it were 9am and the update wasn't going well so they had reason to
think the servers would NOT be up by 10 or soon after, then it would make
sense to edit the post to say so.  And yeah, sometimes they don't do that.
But this time, the patch seems to have taken about as long as expected (I
woke up a little after 11 and logged in to find 75 traders already up in
the bazaar, so it must've been up for a while by then), so I won't fault
them if they didn't have someone updating the page every few minutes just
to say "Yup, we're still on target for 10am."
