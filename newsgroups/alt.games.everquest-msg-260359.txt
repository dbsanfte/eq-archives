Wow.

Hadn't really had time to play in *several* months, perhaps
close to a year.

Wow.

My pet followed me across a zone boundry.  Teleported to the

Then I did trade skills.

Wow.  My arms don't hurt the way they did the last time
I worked on trade skills.

My day today? Nothing major, just Xenon base gone, Scorpio gone,
Tarrant dead, Tarrant alive and then I found out Blake sold us out.
