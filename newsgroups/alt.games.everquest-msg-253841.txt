You're missing the big picture.  At some point, we *have* to say
"enough is enough" or we *all* lose.

Think about it for a minute.  What happens if your children end up in
careers that don't pay well?  What if you're long gone and can't help
them, and they *can't* afford an SUV?  By being pro-SUV, by being
pro-"I've got mine, screw the rest of you", you'll have doomed your
own children to driving a compact or sub-compact car on roads with
dangerous pollution belching SUVs.

We would all do better by our families if we all *cooperated* and
found solutions that benefited everyone, including our children whose
future economic conditions we can't predict.  (If you hadn't noticed,
the Bush Administration is doing its best to destroy the middle
class, and succeeding.)

How about you make the enlightened choice and choose for *neither*
family to be hurt?  Think of the big picture!

Hopefully, your family won't get asthma or cancer or some other
god-awful disease by inhaling the harmful pollution those monster SUVs
belch all over the place.  But hey, if we can't actually *see* it
coming out of the tailpipe, it doesn't exist, right?

We have no right to accuse other countries of doing harmful
short-sighted things when we do harmful short-sighted things
ourselves.

Except that you're short-sighted and hurting your family, as well as
everyone else's family, in the long-term.

Use your brain.  Solutions exist that benefit *everyone*.
