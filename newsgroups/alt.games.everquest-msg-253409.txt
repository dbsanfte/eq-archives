At 60, and definitely 65, BLs are pretty badass.  Not only do they get
all that you list but they do amazing DPS as well.

Well yeah but while the BL is helping himself or his group regen 7
mana per tic, the Necro casts a spell on himself to regen 50 mana a
tic.  In the solo game, the Necro has the edge over all other classes.
 There are situations where other classes have the edge but all-in-all
the Necro rules all the way to 65.

This is actually pretty much the opposite of the truth, IMO.  The
Necro has to be careful to find area to kite, pick non-summoners and
often times can't take down casters but in truth this often doesn't
limit you much.  Meanwhile the Beastlord cannot solo anywhere near the
same level mobs the Necro can (since he and his warder have to get
hit), has few tools to help single pull, will run out of mana when the
Necro is just getting warmed up, and has no tools to save himself when
he messes up.  (cannot root, snare, feign, stun, etc...)

Also, if we bring in farming to the picture, I can think of three
classes that dominate and the BL is not one of them.  The 65 Ranger,
Necro, and Druid can solo in several places for 50-100k drops and
*will* get them.  (Chanters as well but with fewer options IMO). 
Basically, they win because they can snare and no one else can.

My advice is that he has picked a class that is a moderate soloer.  He
can usually out-solo the Rangers and some pure casters.  As for being
overpowered...if that is true he is overpowered in groups, not solo. 
Many of his tools will help groups a lot but will not do enough for
him to be able to solo.  If he can live with that and wants to solo,
so be it.  But if he could get steady groups, he would do much better.
