/sigh

Log in servers going down is not a big deal to those of us already in game at
the time it happens...  However, when one is in game, in the middle of Cazic
Thul fighting some lizards and then goes LD and gets knocked back to log in,
THEN it becomes a big deal...  =P

hehe WTB summon and rez in CT or Torv please!  *eventually*  LOL
