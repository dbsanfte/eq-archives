Nothing dishonest about it.   (waits for the argument sure to follow)...  It's
done easily enough as long as the item can be dropped.   Either give it to a
friend, who then gives it to your other character, or (much riskier) drop it
on the ground and hope you can log in the other character fast enough to be
the first one to that location picking it up.

If the item is no drop, then outside of bugs, there is no way to transfer it
to any other character, whether yours or someone elses.

I'd really recommend asking a friend to hold it though. If you do try the drop
and switch, don't even bother coming here to tell us if someone else takes it
first.  I can almost guarentee that sympathy will be near nonexistant. : P
