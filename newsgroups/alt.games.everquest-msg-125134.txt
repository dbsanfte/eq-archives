Isn't cheating basically admitting that they're not good enough to play like
everyone else?

I can understand a quick petition or bug report, since it -is- a bug, but
why brood over it? Just let it eat away at their self-esteem as they
continue to rack up hollow victories. Eventually, they will quit due to
boredom, and you'll still be around having a good time.

I think graffiti is pretty damn stupid, anyhow... why not simply allow them
to do it as a monument to their stupidity? You see, if they kept it private,
only a few people would know they were dumb. But now that they've spent a
lot of time doing something pointless, the whole world can know they're
dumbasses!

Cheating is proof of their inadequacy.
