First off, welcome (back) to FV.  :)

Yes, Shar Vahl money _sucks_.  Nektulos Forest is only slightly better, 
it seemed to me when I played a dark elf warrior.  Once you're at a 
level to kill the lesser shades and shak dratha in Shadeweaver's 
Thicket, those swirling shadows do sell for good money in the Bazaar; 
I've funded past characters that way.  Still, the best loot-and-sell 
newbie money I've made has been in Qeynos Hills (half elf druid, human 
monk) and in Innothule Swamp (froglok warrior).  Heck, little Renni's 
level 7 and has collected 14 plat, plus change... she'd have more, 
except I buy large bags and any silks or pelts I see on the vendors. 
She's definitely needing an upgrade in armor, though, so eventually I'm 
going to have her take some time at the Bazaar to sell those spiderling 
silks she's been hoarding up.

Feel free to look me up, if you don't mind grouping with a 
gutter-accented froglok who likes nothing better than to hit things with 
something dangerous.  Though I suspect you'll be far beyond me soon 
enough; I'm a slow leveller.  ;)
