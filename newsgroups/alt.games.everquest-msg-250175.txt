I can only speak for my server, but our top guild has almost vanished, the
second (well, the new top really) and third are doing "ok", but definitely
down. My guild, currently focusing on ele gods is doing fine, down only very
slightly.  A few guilds immediately below us are struggling, but then guilds
have been struggling just before and just after RZTW since the second tier
of guilds hit that level of the game.  It's just a point that tests guilds
staying power.   Some make it, some dont.  A number of "casual raiding"
guilds are working their way through PoP just fine.  Family guilds have
always come and gone, it's hard to judge based on anecdotal evidence, though
it wouldnt surprise me to learn they're losing people.  Of course, in the
past they have most often lost people to raiding guilds...

I suspect the guilds with clear goals that seem within reach are thriving
(aka my guild, nearing time, had a 72+ toon turnout tonight). Guilds with
nothing that seems worth doing (aka guilds that have farmed time to death
and dont like GoD or guilds that cant progress in PoP) are falling apart.
None of the "immediate" list will change that, but then I dont think it was
meant to.

What are they going to do, have a whole new expansion in the next patch?
