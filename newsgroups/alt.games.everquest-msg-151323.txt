Sounds good to me :)  I'm always up for more suggestions of 'where to
hunt'.  Would it be class-sorted?  Mention of grouping difficulties
(hard to tell I know, what with server differences)?

Here, let me start:

My necro, who CANNOT hunt in Paludal (rassin frassin lagging zone...),
spent up to level 20 hunting in Oasis.

Oasis, I hear you gasp in horror?  That pre-schooler's hive of scum
and villainy?

Yeah, I know.  It's LOUSY for grouping.  And it's just a trainer
course (pun intended) for those moving on to LOIO.  The thing is, it's
also a soloer's dream.  You know that dock where there are always 15
people meditating and 30 bodies of those who *were* meditating till
some idiot brought an SG or 4 specs to the dock?  You know the pilllar
RIGHT next to it, where there are 3 people meditating and absolutely
positively no bodies?

That is a sweet, sweet spot.  Bind on the ocean-side of that pillar.
Cast your prep spells (pet, buff, etc) and med up again in safety,
while keeping an eye on the traffic below.  I started with madmen,
decaying mummies, and dune spiders.  If you stick yourself about waist
deep in the water while fighting, it's *very* difficult to get adds.
And you know that bug where mobs in Oasis who are next to water when
they turn to run disappear?  Guess where they all show up at?  Yes,
very close to that pillar.  Of course that means you have to stay away
from the spot where they all respawn, since they tend to aggro
whatever's nearest.  But once you've found the spot it's very easy to
avoid, AND very easy to run to as soon as your running mob pops out of
existence.  In fact you can stand perfectly still and STILL smack it
with spells if you feel like it.

Meanwhile, sand giants don't usually pass that way, spectres wandered
by that way twice and never close enough to the water to aggro on me,
and the experience rate was quite tasty for a soloer.  I tried
grouping once or twice and couldn't stand the slow rate of exp we got
unless we were constantly pulling :)

Of course if you MUST group, I'd like to point out that the smart
groups get to orc highway and turn left, and pull down to the side of
the lake.  As long as you avoid that stupid hill that drops you into
the water, it's a fantastic pull spot, and unlike orc highway, sports
little or no passersby.  And if things get too slow there's a
never--never-I'm-telling-you-ever hunted derv camp just around the
pillar on your left that is about the same level as the orcs.

Say it with me now: you do not have to be a moron to hunt in Oasis.

Ryou
(sure, it helps...)
