...4...mobs...?

That's not good.  By any chance do you remember where you were standing
and which mob you pulled?  I'm guessing that you were in the short hallway
and pulled one of the mobs on the side closest to you...and it pathed to
the center then came at you?  *mull*  One interesting thing I noticed
yesterday in Fizzik's camp is that if we pulled a mob, it would bring it's
buddy. But if we fought it at it's spawn point, it's buddy ignored
us.  All because of the inability of Drogan mobs to walk in straight
lines.  

*imagines 4 mobs again* Ohh that's very much not good.
