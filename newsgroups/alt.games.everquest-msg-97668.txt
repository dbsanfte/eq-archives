And, there is an awesome piercer for mobs that don't require magic to hit 
available if you can find them on the merchants, Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick, 
12/29, 1p 5g from the merchants.   My 40th level rogue uses these on non-magic 
mobs (large numbers of them on the moon) and quads for 35-45 withthem, with 
backstabs in the 150-230 range
