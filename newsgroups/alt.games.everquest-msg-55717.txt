My 35 Pally, using Soothe, was able to solo his way back to the graveyard and
keep it cleared.  The only main thing to watch out for is the "El Greeno"
spawns outside the gate who sometimes tend to jump into the fray if you get too
close to the gate.  There's only three of em, but if one gets away they will
summon the others nearby.
