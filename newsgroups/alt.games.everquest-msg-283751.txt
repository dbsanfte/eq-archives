Just my opinion, but if your a first time player, your best choosing a 
newer game like World Of Warcraft or even Dark Age Of Camelot.  All of 
them require a monthly fee, and Everquest isn't any cheaper than the 
newer games which have better graphics. (well unless you want to fork 
over 2 years worth of pay ahead of time).

You can even play Guild Wars which has no monthly fees with 100x better 
graphics.
