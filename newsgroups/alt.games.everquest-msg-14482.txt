Bizbee, if you're having trouble grasping something,
I'll be glad to explain it to you in small words
if you ask nicely.  But if you're going to express
your lack of understanding by being an asshole, then
of course I'm not going to bother, and I'll let your
"I'm so confused" post stand as a testament to your
dimwittedness.

It's not my fault that you can't keep up.

I'm sure your mother would be glad to explain my
post to you, and the relevance of those examples to
the point being made, when she's not busy wiping
the drool from your chin.

Hint for Bizbee's mom:  The point was contained
in the following passage:

# It is common to invoke the name of a company or
# other inanimate object when speaking of the
# actions/desires of the people driving it,
# you moron.
