<snip very long, informative and well written post>

Just wanted to say thanks for posting so much good information about this
game. For those of us who didn't get into the beta and don't read (or don't
believe) the seemingly endless amount of gushing praise for EQ2 on the fan
sites, this is a great way for us to obtain valuable details.

Much obliged.
