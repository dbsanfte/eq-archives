All joking aside this seems the most likely.

You get a hint of how their zones are probably put together with that,
actually. I don't think the map of zonewalls are actually a part of
the physical map, it's probably overlaid, which would make it easy to
fix while you're still building a zone. In this case they made a
mistake (IMO, I have no actual proof of any of this) of where the
mountain line actually started and then simply haven't ever gotten
around to fixing it. Zone fixes seem to be very low priority to
Verant, especially ones with no real consequences like that one
(though it's killed me a couple times long ago).
