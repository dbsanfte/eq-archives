Your chronicles have been most entertaining, and I don't want to see
you lose out on your quest due to a nerf:

Plane of Mischief changes going to the Legends
            server later next month.  The Plane of Mischief is
            the home of the trickster, Bristlebane.  One of the
            most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone is
            in need of a revamp.  We're looking at it now and plan
            to have changes ready for Legends later in August. 
            We'll be keeping the wacky style of the place while at
            the same time making it a bit more playable.
