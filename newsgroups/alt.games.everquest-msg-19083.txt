Nearby GFay is the home to a billion-and-one Rangers, hire one
to group with you for a while and keep checking his/her Tracking
skill for Zarchoomie.  That way you don't have to personally
search every square inch of the large Butcherblock Mountains
hoping to trip over her.

And if the other folks are right and Emerald Drakes are
placeholders for her, use your Ranger to track them down
and kill them while you'r waiting for Mrs. Z.
