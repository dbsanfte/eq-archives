Back when I cared about cash loot, I learned to insist on
a Master Looter plan.  With a rogue in group, I would have
the rogue be the ML.  The rogue can then practice PP
to his hearts content.  He isn't entitled to keep what he
pickpockets, it belongs to the group, just as does cash
he legitimately loots.

I don't expect rogues to PP mobs and keep the loot.
Generally I don't even think about it.  But if I ever
discovered one was doing so, you can bet your
bottom copper I'd send tells to his guild officers,
put him on my ignore list (which doubles as a
"never group with this guy or rez him or help him
in any way" list), and tell everyone in my guild
and on my friends list about him.

I understand that in a role playing environment,
rogues stealing loot out of the pockets of their
friends (which is what PPing their mobs amounts
to) is an interesting option.  But on all but the
few PvP servers, we are artificially restricted
from taking direct steps to control this behavior
by the natural means of smashing the offending
thief into little bitty pieces and recovering the
missing cash by filtering his remains thru a collander.

I -do- think unengaged, uncamped mobs are
fair game, including every HG in RM if you can
manage it... and if rogues went in there and
worked the place seriously, perhaps the green killing
farmers would give up on the place and it would
get left to people who actually get exp off the mobs.
