Well - anyone who doesn't like it enough should just stop paying
them.  I have.  I was so unhappy with the DX9 bullshit that I 
simply didn't resubscribe when my time ran out.  Now I'm waiting
to see if they do anything that would make me want to come back.

In the meantime they don't get my subscription fee or OoW purchase.

They've already shown that money talks - just not enough people 
speaking yet.
