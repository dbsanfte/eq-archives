This is simply incredible! In a little over a year here, I never saw
this, and this is now... what? Either the second or third druid we've
seen posting that they went on a *POG* raid as a Tunare worshipper and

Hello?
Even if you're not roleplaying (because if you were, you wouldn't assist
in *any* way, shape, or form in a PoG raid) you must realize that
invading your Godess's homelands would pose a faction risk?
