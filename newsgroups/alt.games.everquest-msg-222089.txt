Which skills are these?  I notice there are some that I won't get
until level 9, but I don't know which one's became available between
level 2 and 5.  Maybe I should save everything for tradeskills or
spells?

I did try lay on hands yesterday (after I discovered that I had the
capability) but it failed to work and I died.  Is there a skill for
this?
