Actually, it's on a player 45+, and they only loose a normal death, not an
entire level.  They cannot be rezed for experience.

The necro has to have an emerald on them to do it and this sacrifice creates
an "Essence Emerald" which can be used by the necro to rez someone for 93%.

This can save an entire raid if used properly.  If a wipe is imminent, necro
FD until all mobs go away.  Necro gets up and rezes cleric who rezes
everyone else, and raid goes on.  This is the theory anyway, i've never been
able to use it for this, only to rez myself when it seemed there was no
cleric available.


As for the death striking, I remember this happening to me as well when I
was a young'un.  I don't know what caused it, but if it happened to me
today, I would report and petition.  We get ourselves killed enough, we
don't need random deaths for no reason.
