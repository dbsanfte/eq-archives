hehe yup the monk I dueled had serp bracers on, and velium black pearl
rings. It was sad really.

Doh. Its ok. I am still pretty ghetto since I am not in an uber guild and don't
have time to camp much. I still don't have my epic yet. I am working on
saving cash up to get a Fungi Tunic. At least I can buy my way to uberness. =)

Yeah those are my next upgrade. Trying to get my friends to camp the Grey
again.

True. The quests are a pain in the ass but viable for those not in an uber guild like
me. =) Helps to have a tracking friend or alt class to get the quest items.

Yeah that spore covered stuff is awsome. Wish I had it when I was

I did notice a significant drop in my damage when I broke the 1000 ac
mark.

I have been thinking of switching to the spider eyes but I like that +6 magic.

Yes the feet slot for monks didn't used to have any options at all.
I remember wearing Vale reinforced boots AC 7, for a long long time.
Its getting better.

Yup that was my old one. Still keep it in case I need fire resists.

Oops forgot I just got the Silver Shiverback Hide vest! I got it in the bazaar
for only 12k! I about shit my silks! A 31% haste belt for only 12k! I was amazed.
This will hold me until I get my Golden Sash. =)

Nice. Surprised you are not wearing the shaded hide tunic then. =)

I have a goranga also I switch it in when I know I am only going to be fighting
non-casters. Its damn cheap these days as well.

For my weapons I have a Zekha's Katar(love the proc on that thing!) and a
standard Stave of Shielding. For 2hb I have a Peacebringer, I want a Tranquil
staff bad but after I get my fungi tunic. =)

For cheaper stuff. The fighting baton served me well for a long time. I also liked my
Wu's trance stick.
