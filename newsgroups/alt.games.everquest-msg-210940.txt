My limited experience with high-end elven warriors (three wood-elves,
level 65 with 50+ AAs) tells me that this is not true. One is the
second-worst tank on my server. One tanked like a wet paper bag until
he topped about 120 AAs. The third is probably the best unguilded tank
on Torv, but still relies heavily on buffs to get his STA to an
acceptable level.

Forty-odd STA at creation is a *huge* advantage that takes a long time
to go away. For 99% of the EQ population, it will always be relevant.
