I wasn't there for the death, just the cleanup. he he. And Woushi was
dead and gone by the time I arrived. However, I know the guildie wasn't
grouped with anyone but the druid who ported him in. (Who was *not*
attacked, strangely, but they were speculating it was because the druid
was a terribly slow zoner and she didn't show up until probably ten
seconds after the dearly departed guildmate.)  But not grouped with
anyone else to my knowledge. Is there any sort of AoE Bard song that
could effect non group mates and just include anyone standing there in
the general shit pool? Doesn't sound likely, but I'd put nothing past
VI's design when it comes to bard questions. If so, it certainly needs
to be rectified.
