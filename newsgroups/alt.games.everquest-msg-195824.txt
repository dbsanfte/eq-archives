I'd forgotten about Conquest.  Were they ever re-assembled?  I thought I'd
remember reading where they had, but that was a long time ago. ;-)

That's my biggest fear, to be honest.  The whole "Big Fish, Small Pond"
thing .....

Heh ... great story!  That's the kind of stuff I remember from my newb days
as well.  My very first character was a wood elf ranger.  Within my first 5
minutes playing EQ, I'd gotten lost in Kelethin, was led by the nose to my
guild, gotten my tunic, perfomed a half-gainer with a full twist out of my
own hometown and died, then lost my corpse and brand new tunic.

Come to think of it, maybe I should've seen this as an omen ......
