Well,  this makes me feel a bit better.  I don't know if Hercules/Guillemot
were ever officially supported or not.  However, I will be a bit torque'd if
I have to go out & get a new graphics card because I JUST put this computer
together after many months of buying components one at a time.

I didnt get a Gefore because I didnt want a Geforce 2 & I couldn't afford a
Geforce 3.  After my experiences with the ATI that was in my old computer,
I'm not a great fan of that company.  I'm about to build another computer
for my fiance so that she can finally play Everquest with me & I'm rather
hoping to be able to afford a Hercules III (whatever the technical name of
it is), but I rather doubt I can.  I just know that my Hercules runs EQ
without any framerate decay no matter what zone I'm in & I never have to
turn my clip plane down anymore.  My ATI in my old machine was so bad that I
had to have my clip plane all the way down all the time, 3D sky off, spell
effects off & particle density off & even then, the framerate was bad & rain
made it worse!
