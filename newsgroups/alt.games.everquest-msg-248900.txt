Not sure about this,I would guess this would trivialize
the game,everyone running around in elemental gear ?

Remove graveyards from all zones!
I remember when PoP went live,how annoying it was that
the high end players had no longer to worry about dieing,
while the lowbies were struggling in GuK and SoL B.
Again,would trivialize the game and already does.

>3)set monk defensive ability lower than a warriors and higher than a rogues.

Isnt it lower? I never see monks tanking,when there is a
War,Pal or Sk in group.

>4)remove the essence emerald from necro res.

EEs going for 300p on SolRo,not a big deal.

>5)add crappy resses to shamans.

We already have 3 classes,who can res,why do we need 
more?

Nerf Bsts in general,they are way overpowered

Totally agree with this,and while we are at it,raise xp gain
from raiding.

I think its too late for this,the masses who went through the
PoP flagging process would be cry out loud,including me  :)

Again,trivializing the game.

No Idea.  :)

I am doing almost only Ldon.
What I dont like about PoK is the ease of traveling,there is
no feeling of a world when teleporting is available to most
zones.

11) Nerf Enchanters,at least do something about their
charm spells.
