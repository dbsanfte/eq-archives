Hahaha... not even close.  The only limitation on AA points is that you can
only have 99 stored points. (not counting the spent ones.)

I know it doesn't really matter, but since I'm bored and curious, I think I'll
calculate how much it would take to max out my warrior.   (not counting what
he has already bought.)

Skill, points to max.

General skills.

STR - 5
STA - 5
AGI - 5
DEX - 5
INT - 5
WIS - 5
CHA - 5
Sv Fire - 5
Sv Cold - 5
Sv Magic - 5
Sv Poison - 5
Sv Disease - 5
Run Speed - 3
Regeneration - 3
Metabolism - 3
Lung Capacity - 3
First Aid - 3

Total to max general - 75

Archtype Skills: (Pure Melee)

Natural Durability - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
Natural Healing - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
Combat Fury - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
Fear Resistance - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
Finishing Blow - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
Combat Stability - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
Combat Agility - 2 + 4 + 6 = 12

Total to max archtype - 84

Class Skills: (Warrior)
Ambidexterity - 9
Double Riposte - 3 + 6 + 9 = 18
Flurry - 3 + 6 + 9 = 18
Rampage - 5
Area Effect Taunt - 5
Warcry - 3 + 6 + 9 = 18
Bandage Wound - 3 + 6 + 9 = 18

Total to max class - 91

Total to max all AA skills for a warrior - 250

Really one hell of a game extender.   Adding 250 "post 50" levels, without
adding a whole lot of power.    Sure there are some nice toys in there...  but
nothing that would come even close to the power increase of increasing max
level to 70, or even 65.
