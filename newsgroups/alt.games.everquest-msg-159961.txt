More specifically, the port-in spot is 100% safe (barring the most
bizarre train in the history of the game, led by a player who was
HUGELY lost).

Getting from the port-in spot to FV outpost, however, is about
as risky as getting to the FV outpost (from LoIO or DL) has always
been, since it requires traversing the same route.
