It _was_ plainly a personal attack.  That you based the attack on his
membership in a guild you dislike does not change that... see below.

Bullshit.  You attacked his guild, then made a point of noting:
"Oh, wait!  Stasis is YOUR guild, isn't it?"
How is that not an attack on him personally?

Repeating bullshit doesn't add even slightly to its total lack
of truth.

No, the circumstance Lokari refers to is that you have posted only
to conduct a personal attack on another poster.  Your contribution
to the group is nil, your credibility suffers greatly from that fact.

I think that posting an anonymous attack says a lot about a person.

There'll be a lot less to shovel if you quit spewing it.
