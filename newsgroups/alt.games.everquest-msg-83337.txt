Can only get them from players.

Not really needed, though. 10 slot looms can be found in cities for recipies
that need that many items. For storage, a deluxe toolkit can be bought from
the pirates in Ice Clad for a couple plat, 10 slot and lighter than sewing
kit anyway. Of course 10 slot backpack and Rallos packs are better, but more
expensive.
