Also,

I think its a level 40'is spell. You can buy the coffins in neriak, paineel
necro guild, or in the bazaar on Luclin. The latter will have no faction
issues for you.

> are they one use only, or do you get multiple uses?

One use only. Theres a higher level spell thats used the "tiny jaid inlaid
coffins" which are stackable.

You can improve your guard faction by killing the goblins in butcherblock. I
wouldnt bother myself. The vendor at the druid ring will buy your junk, and
you can bay and bank on luclin. After level 9 or so you wont need
butcherblock again till maybe level 39 when you can hunt the dwarf ladies.

Casters can bind themselves almost anywhere. Id just bind myself at the
GF/BB zone and hunt near there. No guards around this area.

krag

Far too many to be worth it.

As a general rule with faction building, the higher level monsters give more
faction. Unfortunately the goblins are all lowish level. There are "crazed
goblins" about level 30, but I dont know what faction they give. They would
quickly fix your faction *if* their faction is right... but i dont know that
one.
