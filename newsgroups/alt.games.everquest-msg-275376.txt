My guess is they did this to cut down on video lag.  In the old bazaar, even 
the fastest machines slowed down trying to render 500 traders.  By spacing 
out the traders in a maze, they cut down on video lag and make it easier for 
people to move about.  With the "Find Trader" feature, navigating the maze 
should be easy.

I'm not saying I agree with all this, I'm saying that's what I believe their 
thinking to be.  =)
