No, hunting in mistmore only makes you easily get good faction with
gorenaire and some other kunark dragons on ring of scale.

There is no easy way to get skyshrine faction, even to glower dubious.
You have to basically go on one or more kael raids since those giants are
very big faction gains. All of the outdoor giants and wolves are very
piddly gains and it would take you a ton compared to one Kael raid.
