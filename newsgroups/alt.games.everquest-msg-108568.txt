Might be too late, but you may want to hold up. I would advise
installing the first three sets, (original, Kunark, and Vellious, and
you could even skip Vellious for now if you wanted) and seeing how it
runs. If it runs fine and you are very confident in your system specs,
then go ahead with Luclin. If your machine is borderline on minimum
specs, Luclin can make it run terribly.

If it's a new machine, however with a fast processor, 512 MB RAM or
more, a *good* video card with a fair amount of onboard memory, and good
sound, then go for it and install the whole thing.
