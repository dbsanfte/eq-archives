} Don't tell me how to fucking post. For 15 years when I first

}USENET and say "I don't like 'top posting' don't do it" and now all
}the other anal retentive bullies have jumped on the bandwagon as 
}well. For Cripes sake, we used to have to cut and past quotes and 
}add in the little arrows ourselves back then. Quoting was a way to 
}remind people that had missed posts what was said before and placed 
}at the BOTTOM of the post to be referenced -if needed-. Geez.. now 
}it's needed even less than then but everybody gets all bent out of 
}shape about it if you post in the wrong place or too much or too 
}little. I bet we could all do JUST FINE without any quoting at all 
}these days.

You shoulda used pnews.  Save article to file and include the file from 
the command line.  What were you doing?  Trying to post with mail?

In the 15ish years I've been posting, interleaved posting with the quoted 
material above has been standard.  There have always been a few renegade 
deviant groups, of course.

I assume you're familiar with RFC 1855?
http://www.dtcc.edu/cs/rfc1855.html

      If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
      summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just
      enough text of the original to give a context.  This will make
      sure readers understand when they start to read your response.
      Since NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing the
      postings from one host to another, it is possible to see a
      response to a message before seeing the original.  Giving context
      helps everyone.  But do not include the entire original!

This would suggest that you've had at least 7 years to adapt to this 
radical new bottom posting idea.  Move with the times, mate.
