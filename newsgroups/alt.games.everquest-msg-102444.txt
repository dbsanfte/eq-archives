... and I quote,
"Said player Vincent Frederico of Rochester, N.Y.: "It's almost like a
drug. If you are not happy with your real life, you can always go in. .
. . Someone who lacks social skills, they could find it much easier just
to play the game instead of going out to a bar."

Oh... now I see. We're pretty fucked up because we don't go hang out in
bars to socialize.

And by the way, I have one local pub that I hit at least twice a week,
so I'M NORMAL, DAMNIT! FUCK YOU!
