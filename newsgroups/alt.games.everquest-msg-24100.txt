 No. I mean underutilized in any sense, whether level 50+ or the level
it was designed for. I created an Erudite and spent time there. It's a
very frustrating zone. On my server you'd be lucky to see more than 4
people in there at once. So, since I couldn't find a group I tried to
solo blue mobs. Well that works well until the kobolds get low on life
and run away down the hall at a very high speed, usually bringing back a
train upon yourself.

  I don't know I just don't see the point of the Warren loot rules. Is
the lack of that code really making Antonica, Kunark and Velious bad
places where people of the apporpraite level can't get loot? Heck, if it
wasn't for the farmers I doubt you'd find anyone in Droga on my server.
Nurga isn't much better as far as people in there.
