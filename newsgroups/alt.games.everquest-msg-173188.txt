Actually, I was referring to your amazingly stupid comment that,
"The US is a "rogue nation" itself. It is far too powerful and is a
destabilising force in the world", and your stereotypical
knee-jerk anti-Americanism.

The clue phone is ringing:

Tell me which socialist paradise you hail from and I'll be
glad to add more to your reading list, focusing more specifically
on your local brand of anti-Americanism and how it relates
to your domestic failures and cultural prejudices.

But getting back to your first question, if you want to understand
the link between 9/11 and our current actions towards Iraq, one of
the essays I linked above does a marvelous job of explaining it
in terms that even you should be able to understand.  No, I'm 
not going to tell you *which* essay; you're more likely to pay
attention and learn something if you have to go looking for it.

Now it's your turn -- reading from your liberal/socialist
talking points memo, you parroted the line about the actions
against Iraq having a strong component of "economic" interest
(at least you managed to avoid the "blood for oil" bumper-sticker,
we should be grateful for small favors).

So, Mr. Policy Analyst, feel free to actually expand on that
thought (if I may give it that much credit) and explain exactly,
in your lockstep mindset, bringing down Saddam or invading
Iraq would bring a net economic boon to Bush and/or the US.
Be sure to include in your "analysis" (*cough*) the interlocked
effects on the US domestic oil industry (including domestic
production or the lack thereof), OPEC production, costs of
waging the war (direct and indirect), the destabilization
of other mideast regimes (and the accompanying effects on
world economies and oil production and cooperation with
US oil companies), and so on (leave out a major factor and
I'll cheerfully nail you on it).  Then, contrast your
scenario with the economic benefits of doing nothing and
allowing Saddam to do what he wants.

This ought to be... interesting.

If you manage to pull it off, you'll be the very first
"blood for oil" nutbar to actually make a case for his
mantra (some have tried, to be sure, but their "analysis"
has been on a grade-school level).

For extra credit, explain why all the "no blood for oil"
chants back before/during the *first* Gulf War managed
to miss the mark so badly but by gosh, it's actually
on the mark *this* time... (Unless you actually want to
try to make a case that GW-I was somehow a great boon
for the US economically.)


>/sits down and straps himself in.

I'm glad you keep your own straitjacket handy, it saves
me the trouble of renting one for you.
