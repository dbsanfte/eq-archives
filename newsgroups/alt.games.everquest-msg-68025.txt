You might try setting the semi-transparent chat window to the same color as 
the parchment chat window (Red:191,Green:175,Blue:143). Then adjust your 
text colors to stand out against the new background. Once you do that you 
should be fine in both modes. This is what I do and I haven't had any 
problems, ymmv.
