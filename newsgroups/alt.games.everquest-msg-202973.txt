    I read the first post up until the lock on Graffe's. A lot of crap,
indeed.

    Depending on the spells it casts, and the resist rate, it might not have
a huge long-term DPS. You need to factor in resummoning time when figuring
out the DPS, after all. A simple retune like making the pet always cast a
Shielding-line spell as soon as summoned might create just the pause needed
to bring the DPS back in line given the spells cast.

    The AoE AI is smart enough to know not to AoE when only one person is on
the hate list. As long as the pet caster was smart enough to know not to use
the fire pet when they're worried about a broken mez, it shouldn't be a
problem. Root, yeah. Ugh. A different pet roots, hopefully that spell would
be left out for that reason.

    That would be nifty. In agreement there - having a pet that doesn't
melee at all would be nice for raids.

    This sounds more like that bolt-casting drake AA ability than a pet.
Given that it lacks melee, I don't think giving it access to cold nukes
would be terribly off. It needs to be able to land damage against
everything, after all, and having three types of nukes would guarantee that
the pet would waste some mana casting highly-resisted nukes (like fire stuff
in Fire). That's an easy way to bring the DPS back down in line, and to put
some of the randomness that SOE loves so much back into the pet.

    You'd have to be careful about what spells it casts if you want a "no
push" pet, then. Seems like most magic nukes have some associated knockback.

    The wizards should be happy if the pet gets Ice Comet. The other cold
nuke options in that level range would make the pet much more powerful. With
Frozen Harpoon the pet could cast for 50% longer, at almost the same DPS,
before needing to be reclaimed. With Lure of Frost the pet could land damage
on a lot of targets it otherwise couldn't scratch. And the DPS would be
through the roof if it could cast Draught of Ice. Heck, I'd be a lot more
concerned about a pet that could cast Draught of Fire than Ice Comet - the
DPS with any Draught is gonna be much larger than that for Ice Comet.

    Were I a wizard, I'd lobby for the pet to cast (as it's DD spells)
Conflagration, Rend, and Ice Comet. All pre-50, so nobody will mistake the
pet for a high-level wizard. All spells have a middle range DPS and minimal
resist mods, so it should put out a moderate amount of damage. And having
all three resists would help lower the DPS even more, so mage plus pet
wouldn't be putting out insane damage.

    I have all but Time. From what I've seen, these are the ten flag
conditions the charm checks: PoV/PoS, CoD, Torment, BoT, HoH, Sol Ro Tower,
Tactics, Fire, Earth/Air/Water, Time. So take the stats of the ones posted
on Lucy, divide by ten, and multiply by how many of those zones you have the
raid access flag(s) for.

    Seven. I believe the NPC is responding to all the flag conditions I've
listed except for the elemental planes and time.
