Hi all,

I need to upgrade my second computer, an old 233MMX, which is just TOO SLOW
for raids and just about anywhere in SOV or Kunark.  Atherons represent
better performance for money than Intels at the moment but i dont know much
about any compatibility problems with them.  The main purpose of the upgrade
will be to play EQ better but i also have several games including GP3, the
Jedi Knight games and the Mechwarrior games that my kids like to play
head-2-head.  Can anyone give me any advice on whether there would be any
problems with an atheron and, if possible, the other games?

Thanks in advance,

Mark Wilson
