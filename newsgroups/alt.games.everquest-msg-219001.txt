Rumble,

Charmed mobs DO take a large proportion of the XP.  It's just in
swarmkiting, you kill so bloody MANY that you don't notice.  If you can \
knock out 20 mobs in 5 minutes, who notices that you only got equivalent XP
for 13?  You still are getting XP for 13 mobs in 5 minutes solo, nothing to
sneer at.

Now, if you swarm the mob down to a runner, sicc your new pet on a fresh
mob,  and finish the original with DoTs instead of another charmed mob,
you'll get a significant boost to the XP - 20 for 20 - but your kill rate
will slow down slightly.

Raivenn Lunatic,
54 bard and practicing!
