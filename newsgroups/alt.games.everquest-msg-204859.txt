    That's the intent.

    Paying attention isn't likely to happen. =/ Also, widespread No Drop
gets rid of the replayability which is so popular with EQ.

    Too many items have no level limits, or stats so good that they are
superior to unlimited items at even half the recommended level.

    Would you include upgrading mob HPs and ATK to match assumed upgrades in
PCs? I was passing through one zone recently with my level 40 Iksar Monk
when I came across mobs that were dark blue, but only by one or two levels.
Ssleeslak was able to kill them with between 5 and 10% health lost per mob.
He has no Fungi, SCHW haste, and uses 12/23 and 17/28 weapons. What he's
wearing is very attainable for any monk, main or twink. Characters like him
could tear through stuff that was based off Old World HPs and ATK.
