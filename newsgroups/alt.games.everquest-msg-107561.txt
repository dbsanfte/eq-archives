I guess the fact that I never ask for money when I port or sow means I was
supposed to be a cleric, since "clerics never ask for money for a rez".

Most of my complaining now is about people who think that their complaints
have more intrinsic merit than mine.

Not to mention that most of the gear I sell I ask people to offer a price
on, so if they think it's too much, why the hell are they buying it?

I guess you also missed the point where I said that even the stupidest and
most minorly competent cleric can walk out of sebilis with 3k in gems for
one night of hunting.  Oh, wait, I'm guessing you're one of those stupid and
minorly competent clerics, please to be not grouping with me.
