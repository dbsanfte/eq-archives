While most of the responses seem to be that having a bow as epic would 
be weak, since the melee option is being pushed, it occurs to me that 
having bow as epic would be -more- powerful than having it as your melee 
weapon; getting epic stats and effects off something that goes in your 
range slot, so you can put the current Best of the Best weapon(s) in 
your primary/secondary slot?

Forget too weak, Bow was too powerful compared to everyone else's epics!
