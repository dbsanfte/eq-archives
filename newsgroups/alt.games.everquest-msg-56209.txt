I would like to know if anyone else has experienced or heard of
problems with the EQ Trilogy. And would like suggestions for solutions
to this if you have any.

I have an AMD 500 Mhz computer with the Voodoo 3 PCI video card.
Bought the original EQ game a few months ago in the little mini-pack
for $9.99. I have had no problems at all and the 3D-accelerated
graphics look fine. I bought the EQ Trilogy so I could venture to
Kunark and Velious. Installed the Trilogy, logged in, and the graphics
are horrible. It looks like the game is not even using the 3D hardware
acceleration of my video card (even though Everquest says "3D Hardware
Acceleration required"; kind of like playing Quake II in software
render mode. I have already downloaded new drivers for my video
card,but didn't help. Here is the really weird part. I uninstalled the
Trilogy and reinstalled Everquest classic from my original CD and it
still looks like crap! What the heck. Does the Trilogy change some
registry setting that relates to EQ that I can't get changed back? And
it's not my video card malfunctioning, because Aliens v Predator  2
looks great.

Also, I installed the Trilogy on a friends computer that is similar to
mine (PIII 450 with TNT2 card) and the graphics look just as crappy on
his.

Any suggestions or explanations would be very appreciated.

PS - I have called Sony Online's customer service line 3 times and it
just rings, and rings, and rings. No answer. Great customer service
guys! That Dark Age of Camelot game is sure looking good.
