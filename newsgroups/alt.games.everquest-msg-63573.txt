If you look at this the right way they're saying "Cats have ultravision,
land on all fours without or with minimal damage, 9 lives, and strong for
their size....but eat a lot to make up for it."

Warrior and Shaman reproduced.....
.....I don't want to picture what that would look like Ogre or Troll style
(female ogres doing that....not pretty sight).

They can wear up to leather armor....yeah but with STR and AGI enhancements
that makes up for it....race balancing.

I wonder if it would be safe to play a Vah Shir on the first day of the
release....would be hard on hunting.  That's when its time for exploration
only....make a few LV1 corpses....have fun in the first few levels while you
still don't lose EXP and regain food after death.  Take everything off and
put it in the bank (prevents need for corpse runs) and explore the higher LV
zones at LV1.  Make a LV1 run to Freeport, or even Kunark, or maybe as deep
into Velious as you can (by the way, get to LV 6 first, with an item on you
just to leave the corpse for 24 hours for all to see your achievement).
