Hi Gang,

I realize this is completely off topic, sorry for that, but I can't think of
a better group to ask this of...

My daughter's birthday is coming up and we got her a Gameboy Advance.  She
wants the Pokemon games which as far as I know are only for the Gameboy
Color.

My question is, are the Color cartridges compatible with Advance?

Again, sorry to stray off topic but I'm hoping ya'll have the answer here...
:o)
