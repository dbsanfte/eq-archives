Sure the intended insult is that they are a coward, but by way of 
asserting they are vagina, implying they are a girl and invoking the 
sexist stereotype that girls aren't brave. It gets you to coward, but 
its an ugly offensive road.

Sort of like calling someone a dickhead is usually intended to mean 
'stupid thoughtless jerk', and not literally the 'end of a penis'. But 
the metaphor of dickhead as 'stupid thoughtless jerk' derives by way of 
the anatomical reference. (ie That one does ones thinking with one's 
"little head".)
