I thumbed through the Constitution, and found nothing suggesting that.  It's
ok if you want to consider your property as belonging to the state, just
don't make the same decision for me.  The State produces nothing, it only
consumes.  Sometimes you get good byproducts of consumption (EMS, police,
military), sometimes you get pure flatulance (spend some time dealing with
the beurocrats in the DMV, and you'll see what I mean).  I'd like to know
when your idea became "the social contract," and when I signed it.  It seems
you just kinda declared it all by your lonsome.

That's why the U.S. has had one of the strongest economies in history, and
the best quality of life?  Sorry, but your socialist friends are filling
your head with mush.  There's also the fact that communism violates basic
human dignaty, whereas capitalism allows you to succeed or fail based on
your own skills and dedication.

"WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN????"  Bah, looking at what welfare has done to the
children of the inner cities, I think it's about time we end the entitlement
society.  I'd say Johnson's "Great Society" has done more harm for minority
youths than even the most viscious racists could pull off.

Thanks, David... Every no and then it takes a post like yours to remind me
why I'm a libertarian.
