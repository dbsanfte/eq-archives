    Rez saves the target more time than port or SoW. During that saved time,
the target can go and do whatever they are capable of doing that makes them
maximum cash per unit time. If I res someone, I'm not saying "gimme X plat,
that is THE price for all people"; I'm making an assessment of what they're
going to make during the time I save them, and what my share would be were I
a partner in that. Since you ARE asking me for something that is normally
considered a benefit for my groupmates.

    Congrats on being altruistic. Now recognize that "not altruistic" is not
equal to "greedy asshole".

    The editing is mine on the above paragraph - I note you haven't called
those druids that do "port rounds" greedy assholes, despite them doing the
exact same thing as the clerics are doing. And the comment that really gets
me in all of this? Oddly, it's the "if they're not doing anything else at
the time" part. Why am I logged on if I'm truly doing nothing, and if I'm
doing ANYTHING (chatting, travelling, rearranging my bank account) why
should it be more important to me to res a stranger than to do what *I* want
to do with my time online?
