You can still buff it.

It shows up in the pet control box, thats about as close to a being a real
pet as its gonna get.  Sure you can keep it alive with chain pulls if you
get aggro, hardly worth it though.

It is a dot with a graphic, same as shaman pet, beastlord pet, etc. Except
those are permanent and controllable, hence real pet.

Pet = any summoned creature to aid caster.
Real pet = controllable, permanant ally summoned by caster.
