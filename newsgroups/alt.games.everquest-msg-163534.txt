    How do you suggest they figure out what single cap applies to an item
across all servers?

    The number one mistake they made was calling them "epic" quests. It's a
class weapon quest with a particle effect. It is not meant to be the best
weapon ever for as long as the game exists. If it were, what would be the
point of adventuring? "I could kill Rallos Zek, but I'll still have the same
freaking weapon as that guy LFG in Velk's. Why bother?"
