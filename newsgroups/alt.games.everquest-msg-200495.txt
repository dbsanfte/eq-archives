Just to be clear - the FACTION quest is doable at indiff.  The SS armor
quest requires ally - I prefer to go for max ally, myself.  If you're indiff
now, about two to three Vindi kills (with the associated PoZ kills) should
get  you into the ballpark.  I've never seen a raid balk at having a faction
leech along, so long as you're  polite about it.  Stand at the back, wait
until he's almost dead, drop a arrow onto him, reap the benefits.
