I think EQ could be improved by adjusting the factional system as follows...
make undead kills increase the faction for clerics opposed to that undead,
at least locally. Johnny the iksar can, at the moment, get fabulous faction
with merchants and guards by killing the appropriate creature, but as soon
as he walks in the gate, bam, some member of another faction will pounce.
This doesn't make for good roleplaying, since if you want to be a "good"
iksar, you should be able to prove it without recourse to wolf form,
invisibility etc to use quests in a  way they weren't designed for.

Also, why are none of the halas guards impressed by you killing their
enemies? Why not make goblins or snow orcs give a factioanl increase to the
wolves of the north?

One thought i had was to introduce a flow on effect for related factions;
for every 3 faction points generated killing in orc in east commons, for
example, put one factional point to steel warriors, and the reverse should
apply eg killing a halfling town should make you loathed amongst all the
good races.
