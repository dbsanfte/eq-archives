I would double/tripple check the numbers again. Make sure ever 1 you
see actually is a 1 and not a 7 ... and so on. Not sure if SOE asks
for the CCV2 number (the one on the back next to the signature for MC
and Visa, not sure where it is on Amex and Discover/Novus) but if they
do make sure you're using the correct numbers - there are sometimes
several sets of them.

It is also very important to get the expiration date right.

Lastly, give it a few hours and try again (their cc processor/gateway
may be down)

If you're sure you got those, your only option is to call your CC
company.
There are several things that can cause your card to get locked up
- The card is maxed / You didn't pay your CC bill for a while and they
want to talk to you
- The card has been replaced by a new one that was mailed to you (it
doesn't have to have expired)
- The card has been reported stolen by someone
- The card has a block
  - This can happen if the fraud prevention triggers (Have you made
several unusual payments, possibly larger than normal recently?)
  - This also now happens when merchants accidentally use the wrong
expiration date. This is a pretty new thing I think: When an online
merchant (someone who doesn't actually hold the card to process it)
uses a wrong expiration date, the CC company will block the card until
you call them and unblock it.
