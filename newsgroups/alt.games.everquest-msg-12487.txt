Can only agree with what people have said to you Paul.  Keep the money, your
gonna need it, or if you really wanna do it all by yourself with no outside
help, pass it on to someone worthy, don't drop it : )

I had only been playing a week or so, when someone gave me some nice kit,
wasn't anywhere near the value you got, but it always stuck in my mind, what
a kind act!. Now whenever I am in a newbie zone, I look around for what
looks like "genuine noobs" and give them what I can.  I usually hand out
Gnoll hide lariats and Split paw armour as I am in PAW and they are dropped
all the time, and of no real use to me.

Just remember what a genuine act of kindness it was and try to do the same
for someone else.

You can also bet your butt that it was a drop in the ocean for the player
that gave you them!  Its amazing how quickly you go from thinking a few
hundred pp is a lot of money, to thinking that its chicken feed  : )

Never look a gift horse in the mouth!
