Wasn't thinking it was a conspiracy. But I know how it goes. As resources 
shift, CS usually gets hit first. It's a good way to save some cash. 
Admittedly Sony does have deep pockets, but the "suits" might see it 
different. If they can save some cash they will. It's all bottom line to 
them. Preventing abuse wasn't the only reason for the rotating GM's. I'm 
sure there are less of them now. EQ2 might not need CS now, but I bet more 
and more resources are shifted from EQ to EQ2 as time goes on.
