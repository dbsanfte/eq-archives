Hi All 

I am just over halfway through this, and am working on the other 4
Candy Treats.  A few of us got together to do it, and we pooled our
clues or thrashed out ideas - we had a bit of amusement, anyway  :)
No idea what the reward is yet, mind you.

If anyone needs a clue, drop me an email, as I don't want to dump
spoilers in here.
