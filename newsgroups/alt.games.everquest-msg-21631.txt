Depends what you're really asking.  Are you wanting to know if that was
something that you and/or other players would feel was a cheat on some grounds
that you could justify and/or explain?  Or do you know if a GM would nail you
for it?
  You used a character to kill the fish. The character suffered the results by
getting the bad faction hit.  You logged.  Another character of yours is logged
on and finds the dead fish body available for looting. (Somebody else could have
just as easily come along and looted it while you were changing characters. Just
your good fortune they didn't.)  Their character loots the corpse and uses the
item to complete the quest.  Where's the problem?
  As to what a VI rep would say? Who knows. Trying to read their minds as to
what is or isn't an exploit will only get you an aneurism. But it's so low level
I doubt GMs are gonna spend much time watching that pool for the dead fish
quest. There are much, ermmmm..... bigger fish to fry.
(yes, I know... *groan*)
