 Agreed. Split sucks, basically. If you have a steady group and know you
will all be aorund, having a masterlooter (usually the cleric) is the
best option, then they just do a manual split at the end.

 Lower level groups are probably best to use FFA if they will be
rotating people on a constant basis. In these cases, twinks are usually
newbies best friends since they will pass on all the loot.
