Everyone who posted here had great adivce. I remember creating my first dark
elf
character. Anyone here can tell you that Neriak is probably the hardest city
to
get around when you first start. I think it took me an hour to finally get
out of the
dang city! hehe

As everyone said, travel a bit. When I came across new zones alot of times
I'd hug
the zone wall. Until I started to get familiar with that particular zone
then I would run
across gung ho. But there's nothing more exciting when your trotting along
in the Karanas
and suddenly getting tagged from behind by a lion! When somethings gets you
out of no
where your heart jumps and you might find your self running in circles
without you knowing it.
Yikes!

Here's a couple of suggestions: Don't /shout for help most of the time
you'll probably
be unfamiliar with your surroundings and can't direct anyone to your exact
location since
you're probably running in circles. Use /yell if somethings on you if
possible. Get close but
not too close otherwise they can complain to GM's about being trained (
intentionally getting
a mob to attack another player character to get it off your back ) and use
/y or /yell if there's
some helpful folks, which for the most part there are, they can either root,
snare or blast it to
oblivion for you. Just be sure to thank them or toss a couple heals or
Spirit of Wolf on them
to show appreciation. You'll start making friends that way. And finally
there's an item that looks
like a wand that has 3 charges on it to help locate your corpse buy a couple
and keep them in
the bank. If anyone can help me on the name it would be much help to our
friend here.

Anyway writing this brings me back to the days when I was a young newbie and
one of my
favorite memories before the expansions came out, was running thru NKarana
to SKarana
past the wooden bridge since I hadn't seen anything like that before. I also
thought that the music
that played when you got close to it was so cool! hehe

Good luck buddy
