I LOVE the Plane of Knowledge!
Woot! This is an AWESOME addition to the game.

Instant ports to 90% of the cities in the game!

My monk is now a porting class weeeeeeee!
With her gate hammer she can port to The Overthere
any time she wants and since there is a portal book
to the PoK right there she has access to the whole world,
the moon, and the planes!

Just FYI ALL the portals are safe for any class or any race.
They put you close to the city but not in Agro range of
any guards. Just be careful which way you walk. Don't even
need invisibility, (But have it up if you have it just in
case some idiot trained the portal, the portal does not
drop the invisibility.)

A good idea to do is to take a tour and visit all the portals
so that you know where they put you. Mark the spot on all your
maps. This way you can hit the ground running and be ready if
you need to get somewhere fast.

I would have paid the 25 bucks if the expansion included nothing
but the PoK.

Cities that do not have ports are Kael Drakkel, Skyshrine, Katta
Castellum (bummer) and Sanctus Seru. Some of the ports are kind
of redundant like the portals to Kelethin and Felwithe are like
50 yards from one another in Gfay LOL!! The ports to Paineel and
Erudin are both to Toxx, but at least they are opposite sides of
the zone.
