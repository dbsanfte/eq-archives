Got up this morning, logged on, ran accross LOIO and handed in tooth, 
getting some bandages and upgraded medal, then took my chanter friend to 
COM where we got her to a blue from 44 before going to an LDoN run. 
There she dinged 44, we finished up the mission (10 whole points at 47, 
imagine how many LDoN's I'd have to do to buy a 510 point augment!)  and 
I logged out.

Later, having read over my notes a bit, I ran back to LOIO (what a pain) 
and gave the guy the next trigger phrase, recieving a sealed note for my 
trouble.

Back to POK, I picked up a Virtue and an AQ for haste, then went to 
Field of Bone and ran out to the next quest trigger guy.  Looking thru 
my stuff, the bandages were gone; they are clicky GHeal items, three 
charges worth.  Must be No Rent.  Heck with em, says I, I put up Fungal 
Regrowth off my staff and hand in the note.  Instantly I'm in a little 
area where a vah shir female comes runnning up and attacks me.

She's DB to me, seems to be immune to stun (at least she evades it every 
single time thru the whole fight), can't be disarmed, intimidate never 
goes off so I can't say whether she's immune;  frenzies on occaision, 
but isn't all that impressive.

Fight goes pretty well, I'm ahead by about 10% when she stops attacking 
and becomes unattackable for 30 seconds or so, where I'm supposed to use 
the bandage things.  But I just stand around regenning hp, heck, I'm 
already ahead and don't need the help, if things don't get harder I'm 
going to win anyway.

There are two more pauses of this nature, the melee doesn't get any 
worse, I finish the fight at over 50% hp.  Loot the body, there's a 
30/40 axe on her with some interesting stats, but no proc or anything 
that would really make me prefer it to the 40/40 I'm currently weilding.

I say Return, get popped back out, hail the quest guy and get an image 
elixer.  Running back to LOIO again (what a pain!) I end up crashing 
while zoning into POK, get the character already on server message, so I 
back out and come here to post update.
