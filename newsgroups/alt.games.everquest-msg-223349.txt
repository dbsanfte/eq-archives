Even with a single box, you can rez/corpse summon/etc *others*. And 
that's a good selling point if you're trying to convince others to do 
something actually risky.

I'm not much of a self-twinker at the best of times, but I do use their 
abilities (like tracking, alchemy, foraging, etc to help eachother out).

This is something that can't be done on FV.

I do dual box, but on FV that only buys me two characters... not 16 :)
And I *do* crave variety, and even the 'alt-interaction stuff aside' I 
wouldn't enjoy it as much if I had to maintain multiple sets of friends 
and guilds if I had to hop from server to server to play the various chars.
