Actually, he's right, but didn't phrase it well.  The last phase of ID is a 
kick, and it must hit for the skill be be successful.  If the creature is 
vulnerable only to magical attack (like wisps) then you must be wearing magic 
footwear to hit it, and thus trigger the the ID effect.

The slippers don't GIVE you ID, but they make it possible to use ID on magic 
critters.
