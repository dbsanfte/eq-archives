Great idea.  I was running through (well, levitating over) Innothule the
other day omw to Guk, when I saw things in ooc like:

"Is Soandso here?"
"Everyone sowed?"
"Soandso isn't tagged."

Did a /w, and sure enough the zone was full of trolls, most lvl 1, all of
the same guild.  The Naked Troll Race from Grobb to Freeport was about to
begin.

Frogloks never looked so good .......
