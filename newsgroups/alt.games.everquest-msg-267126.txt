Runnyeye was weird last night - zones going down, zones being empty
then suddely getting updated with players and NPC's.

After a while I gave up on clearing my quest list, and went to Oakmyst
and hunted (and got to level 13 - yay !)

When I get on next, I think I'll be heading to the sewers, as I have
about 7 quests that need me down there.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
