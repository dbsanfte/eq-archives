VI has stated in at least one post to the developers board that
proc rate is affected by level (I've noticed this), dex, and whether
the weapon is one-handed or two-handed.  Can't recall whether they
ever said anything about delay specificly.  I have noticed that
with Instrument of Nife (Paladin self-buff that gives a chance
of a DD vs Undead proc to any attack) it doesn't seem to matter
whether I'm using a 49 delay 2hander, a 30 delay 2hander, or a
27 delay 1hander with shield, I seem to get about the same
frequency of procs over time.  Based on this and other folks reports,
I'm guessing that they handle many/most/all procs via script, allowing
them to attach most weapons to a generic script (or perhaps one of
several) to determine whether the proc fires, while making it very
straightforward to give special weapons special rules.
