I hope that some day these debates would become more than you're a whiner
and you're a VAK.

Fact is, regardless of the "Why" collision detection for NPCs is terrible.
Does it affect game play badly?  Yes, at times.

Does Verant focus to much on the challenge presented to power gamers more
than casual gamers?  You can get that feeling from talking to them, but that
is more due to the interviewer than the interviewee..

Perhaps I'll ask to interview Gordon some day and I'll ask questions like:

Will there be more content for the soloing minimal time player in the
expansion?

Do you understand the needs of the minimal time player?

Of course most interviewers appear not to be concerned with questions such
as those.
