2-handers with delay 27 or less get [1-hander dmg bonus + 1], which
is significantly inferior to delay 28+ 2-handers as you level up.
The delay 28+ damage bonuses scale with the delay, but they do lose
ground slowly.  At the end (L65) a 28 delay weapon (the WMBS, for
instance) has the best dmg bonus vs. delay ratio, 35/28 for the WMBS
vs. 45/44 for Windblade.

I've seen some stuff on the Riposte issue at Paladins of Norrath, where
Romidar was comparing Longblade of Vitality (a 25 delay 1-hander) to
Windblade.  He saw roughly a 3% increase in mob DPS (despite the small
increase in AC from his shield).  3% doesn't seem likely to be critical,
unless you're fighting mobs that can do on the order of 20% or more of
your hp in a blow.  Of course, it's pretty damned stupid that equipping
a 1-hander and a shield decreases your effective defense compared to a
2-hander, but that's EQ for you.
