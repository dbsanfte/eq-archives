Well - make the change worthwhile. Look at Runnyeye, they revamped the
zone and its STILL empty all the time (at least on my server). Is it
just because of the lack of interest in mid level zones now? It seems
most players at this level range are alts and pretty much have thier
own hunting patterns down (like, always hunting crocs in oasis or
Paladul Caverns as examples)

It would be cool to completely redisgn a whole zone - layout and all -
with the new graphics in mind. New textures are nice - but its still
the same ol' blocky zone layout.
