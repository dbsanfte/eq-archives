<grin>

I'm with Telewest, have never had any problems, get flawless Broadband for
�25 a month (and 90 channels of crap on my TV!) and I've just signed up for
their 1 month free trial of 1Mb broadband.

I'd rather pay slightly more for a more reliable service.

If you're in an area Telewest do Broadband in, get it.
