Personally I had the cash, but I lacked the inclination. In fact in the 
case of Temperence on lowbies my cleric wouldn't even bother healing 
them as I levelled up.

I'd ask if they had temp, (or cast a heal on them and see how much their 
hitpoints moved) and if they did I didn't bother keeping them over 30%. 
My 15th level cleric with breeze was not going to dry himself out 
keeping that idiot int-caster-cum-tank alive.

Still waiting on temperence. :)

And KEI is still a problem, but at least much less of one. C2 is still 
virtually irrelevant. And enchanters are still being overlooked in the 
46-56 level range because of it.
