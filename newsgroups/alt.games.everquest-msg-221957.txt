Even outside of LDoN, I hate waiting for a tank to try and taunt
before a mez break. I'll always load up my cheapest root and have the
next mob rooted when the first dies. Then all you have to teach the
tank is that the next mob to be attacked is the one I'm facing, and
most of 'em can handle that <g>.
