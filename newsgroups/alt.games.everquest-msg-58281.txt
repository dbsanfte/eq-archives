You will not evade me IS the message for being summoned... but the initial
message was "I'll teach you to interfere with me...."  I misread the post
and thought they were talking about summons

Btw, unless you know of any dragons below level 50, im pretty sure only 50+
mobs can summon (of which, dragons would be 50+.. so long since i fought
naggy with my mage to be certain though.. i thought they were 52, same as
the max level to be able to hit them)
