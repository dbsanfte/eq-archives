I have loads of information, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, i'll =
just give you a brief summary just for reference

1) God created the perfect woman for me as I think he does for all =
people who choose to follow him.

2) Her and I basically fell in love the moment we met, but the world =
rejected us. Two people can't fall in love and be together unless the =
people around them think it is a good idea, and not a single person in =
the entire world accepted the fact that we might like each other or =
encouraged it in anyway. To this day it feels like I never really got to =
know her because it was just too perfect, and God seems to be telling me =
that it was on purpose for a reason to show that the world had grown so =
cold that even two people who were completely perfect for each other and =
generally the nicest and intelligent people that you could imagine could =
not possibly be together in this time, Perhaps as one final reminder of =
what paradise is before the real shit hits the fan. I'll write an =
article on the Garden of Eden later if I have time.

3) I believe she is now dead, I think she killed herself today around =
5pm. I was at work in view of 10 people and have security logs showing =
that I was nowhere near her, she obviously chose that time so I wouldn't =
get in trouble. Here is why I think she is dead.

    a) I physically felt a burden leave my heart like the only thing =
keeping me on the earth was her, and now that I think, it was, and that =
is probably why God created women in the first place I would think, it =
gives one a reason to exist.

    b) God told me she was going to call me at work today, which is =
reasonable I suppose, she would know what my number is. Then at 5, he =
basically asked me if I wanted to be an angel, and told me that she had =
committed suicide and said that was an interesting strategic move as the =
time of his return largely hinges upon my death which cannot be a =
suicide, someone has to knowingly destroy me because they choose hell =
over heaven.=20

4) Here are the reasons she did this apparently:

    I basically did the very same thing on a smaller scale, after I last =
saw her 10 years ago, I basically rejected God and was on my way to =
Hell, but somehow escaped at the last second. God reminds me that this =
was all predestined. I had never really met anyone else that I liked, =
not as much as her almost as though she was the female version of me. =
God says she essentially was and that no one like her will ever exist =
again.=20

    I would assume that she was feeling an immense amount of emotional =
pain, God assures me that she knows I was not to blame, and that she =
loves me, although I will not be seeing her for awhile as she is now in =
hell because she committed suicide, but apparently you can get out of =
hell depending on who you are, I guess there will be some people in hell =
that will only be there for a while as though they aren't really =
supposed to be there but for some reason they are. Kind of like I spent =
time in prison even though I probably didn't really belong there, I =
guess she is in hell because those are the rules, this song just =
happened to be playing right now

Journey From Mariabronn
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

(Kerry Livgren/Steve Walsh)

Two began together, lived as one
Each one to the other had become
More than a friend, living to meet a common end
They were true, each one knew all is well

Still the elder knew it could not last
Hidden memories from the young one's past
Drew them apart
Both knew that deep within there hearts they must part
Each their own seperate way

It puzzles me how we can be so close and yet worlds apart
Can it be, my memory has torn my life in two
>From the very start
I screamed for the devil to let me be
I called to the heavens to set me free
Today I prayed for the answer and not one
Of the gods in the sky would rescue me

Dreams of fortune fill the young one's mind
Learn the worldy ways of hope to find
Love on the way, searching to find the light of day
In his soul he had found his own way

But to each other they soon will return
Destiny fulfilled, their words will burn an eternal flame

Here is another good one.

Don't Fear The Reaper
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain..we can be like they are
Come on baby...don't fear the reaper
Baby take my hand...don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly...don't fear the reaper
Baby I'm your man...

Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity...Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday...Like Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday...Redefine happiness
Another 40,000 coming everyday...We can be like they are
Come on baby...don't fear the reaper
Baby take my hand...don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly...don't fear the reaper
Baby I'm your man...

Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew then disappeared
The curtains flew then he appeared...saying don't be afraid
Come on baby...and she had no fear
And she ran to him...then they started to fly
They looked backward and said goodby...she had become like they are
She had taken his hand...she had become like they are
Come on baby...don't fear the reaper=20

God seems to be suggesting to me right now that if I killed myself =
tonight, I could be with her tonight and even if we were in hell at =
least we would be together with no one to bother us for the first time, =
he says it would be ok because there is nothing here left for me to do =
and no one really wants me here anyway, and that is ok, they don't want =
me here because I have chosen to be happy instead of miserable.=20

Feel like I was poisoned, going to send this in case I drop over dead.
