Part of being a cleric is getting screwed on peridots :(  Sorry to break it
to ya, but that's just the way it works.   Other classes do use up stuff
that costs plat as well (arrows, rog poisons, etc), but over time, I'm sure
the clerics eat more costs....  Any group I've ever been in will gladly make
sure that any peridots that get looted go to the cleric, but that'll never
cover the number you use.  Get used to it; it's just the way it is.
