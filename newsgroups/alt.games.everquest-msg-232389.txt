Hi All;

A friend of mine and myself got into a discussion about adventure points and
we are split on the following question, so I want to bring it to the
"board":

I grind away in camp A till I hit the top item for 1450 points then;
I grind away in camp B working toward that top item, however, after about
800 points I change my mind and decide I want to go back to camp A and get
that FT1 item for 760 points.

My friend says I CAN'T go back to camp A and get the FT1 item with the
points I've earned in camp B. He's says I can only spend the amount of
points there that I have earned there. If I have spent my points in camp A
then I have to start over on Camp A to buy the item.

I say, I CAN go back to camp A and spend camp B's points there because I
have "qualified" camp A to spend that many points no matter where I earn
them.

You're the judge.  Who's right or did we both miss it, LOL.
