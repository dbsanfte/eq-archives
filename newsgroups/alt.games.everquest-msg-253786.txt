I have not seen anything I need 2k won't support that XP will, and 2k seems
to do a much better job on my machine than XP does in terms of
performance/memory footprint.

The only thing 2k won't support that comes to mind is my Hyperthreading
processor at work. 2k however supports my duallies at home just fine.
Still, I'd take XP (pro) over anything but 2k. (XP home is like saying 'I
want to be an uber tank, I'm going to roll up a wood elf ranger'.)

let's see, at home: 2k, 2k, 98 Se (I play NFS:Hot Pursuit on it), XP (laptop
came with it, can't be bothered to reformat, though everything's supported
under 2k), FreeBSD, FreeBSD, FreeDos, GS/OS ;-)

Damn I got too many computers.
