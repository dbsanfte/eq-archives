I'm aware of that, Bill, and I was in error when I said "hardly anyone
reads"... I should have said "in this NG", since this IS a primarily english
speaking/writing NG. At least, most of the posts that *I* read here are in
English.

It must be wonderful to be fluent enough in those languages to be *able* to
respond. I wish I was, but alas, I can speak English, a bit of Spanish, some
French (from being born in New Orleans) and a bit of Latin, from classes I
took while in school. I cannot read or write other languages... not from a
desire not to, just from the simple fact that I have not taken any more
language courses. I wish that I COULD speak all those other languages... it
must be a wonderful feeling, to be able to speak to those people, on their
own terms. I simply doubt the wisdom of someone posting to a primarily
English NG, if they want an answer/response. Most people are not as fluent
as yourself (much to the detriment of the race of men in general), and most
people in *THIS* NG post in English. Why on earth would someone who only
speaks Chinese (as an example only) post to a mostly English NG? That is my
question. I am not intolerant, and yes, I do know that the rest of the
peoples of the earth do speak in other languages besides English. I just
wonder why they post <here>, where many people cannot understand them.

Is that that hard for you to understand, my friend? I was asking a question,
not being a rascist.
