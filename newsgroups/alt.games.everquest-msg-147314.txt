My guess is that the warder is on a short spawn time to deal with the
backlog of clerics waiting for their epics.  If the warder was on even an
eight-hour spawn, I guarantee that someone would "/petition I was camping
the warder for eight hours waiting for her to spawn, then LameCleric01 came
and turned in their shard before I could, and then Ragefire spawned and
wiped us out, gimme a rez and a new RF, waaaah!"

Verant's whole motivation behind this change was to eliminate the Customer
Service headaches the contentious RF spawn was creating.  And they do *not*
want to create *new* CS headaches - they learned a painful lesson when they
moved RF from SolB to Skyfire, eliminating one CS nightmare and creating an
even larger one in its place.

I actually have to admire the new Ragefire setup.  You can't multi-quest the
RF part any more.  There's no point to trying to kill-steal Ragefire - you
still need the no-drop piece the warder gives you after you turn in the
shard, and that triggers RF anyway.  And you can't farm Ragefire for the
Naggy loot table - not unless you get a cleric that's on the last part of
their epic and is willing to spend days upon days farming fragments in
Skyfire rather than actually completing their epic.  So, in one master
stroke, Verant has completely eliminated any possible contention players
might have over spawning Ragefire.

To paraphrase Bill Cosby, Verant Customer Service is not interested in
justice, they just want quiet.  :)
