you'll note that you have several files in your eq directory
with your character's name and a number.  The number is the
number of the server.  One of those (the .Ini?) has the hot
button info in it.  If you were to rename it with his character's
name and servernumber and drop it in his EQ directory, he will
have those hot-buttons.

Yep - it's the INI (just looked :) ) he'll also get your
friends and ignore lists.
