Not quite.  His post implied that it could only improve through use.
Then he further confused the issue with the mistatement "For races
with Bash and slam ..." (Bash is in no way a race-specific skill,
and every race with Slam allows at least one Bash capable class).
But mostly, I was after the "Slam can't be trained" idea that is
occasionally posted here.  While technically (almost) true, it is a
stupid thing to say because training Bash has the effect of training
Slam.
