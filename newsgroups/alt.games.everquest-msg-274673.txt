There are bleeders in the river which will chew you up in no time.  At
least until they get aggro on somebody and then get stuck near the
zoneline.  After that, the river is usually clear, just don't count on
it ;)

Nek has a ton of aggro, get ready to sprint a lot.  After the broken
bridge, follow the right branch of the road, then stay on that road the
entire way to the zoneline (heading south).
