No, I'm not kidding, I'm a halfling with a base 100 strength.  and the stats
on crafted bracers suck massively.

I prefer the crafted for normal hunting, but if I KNOW there's gonna be a
lot of casters around, I will take the extra save magic on bloodstained.

Also, I rarely see crafted pauldrons for sale, but bloodstained mantle's are
sold nearly every day, like I said, I quested mine after getting lucky with
the top and middle of the rune, they had been left to rot by high level
farmers in runnyeye in the first few days after the pickclaw invasion, and
then when auctioning for the bottom, a level 54 warrior gave it to me, then
it took a month or so to get the gem, (vendors rip me off, I got an
enchanter with cha buffs to buy it for me), before that I had the
Bloodstained mantle, and my 39 warrior friend still has one because he can't
find anything better for sale, and doesnt want to hunt anything better
himself.

I don't know why you say at least 45 with a full group, a friend of mine got
pieces at 38 with a full group ( although he lost the roll on all of it....)
and besides, it sells rather cheaply compared to some of the class armors
( except the BP which is usually same or more than class armor )

Stats are meaningless? gee, wonder how well I fight if I don't have any +str
gear on and am encumbered by my 100+ weight of armor....  heaven forbid that
I should LOOT something or carry some coin around...

Also, Caster mobs with 100+ point DD spells really hurt, resisting them is
nice; I need more fire resist... mine is only 22...
