1st I didn't insult anyones intelligence that was you...  it wasn't me
that decided to call anyone a "fucking moron" was it?

2nd many of the people disagreeing with you, (ie including me) aren't
selling plat *and* even strongly agree that it should be stopped. So
we aren't trying to justify "our right to sell it" and we have no
motivation to "intentially delude ourselves".

3rd If it was so obvious that anyone with "half-a-fucking brain" (your
words again) could tell that copyright applied then there would not be
so many of us that disagreed with you. Maybe you are in fact right...
but its not self-evident to anybody except you. Ideally I'll  wait for
a courts decision, but I'd be prepared to consider the findings of a
American laywer who is willing to perform and publish an unbiased (as
in uncommissioned by either side) report on it.
