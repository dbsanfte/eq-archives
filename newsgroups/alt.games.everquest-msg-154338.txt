If that guild is ready for VS, then engage.  What are you waiting for?  If
you weren't ready and another guild took it..  sucks to be you, go play on a
calendar/rotation server

FCFS - The first guild with a force wins the race to the mob.  If we have 30
people in Kael, we've done the race to Tormax...   if we have 10 people then
we dont have a reasonable force.. so if any other guild zones in with 30
people, Tormy is there.   Doesn't matter if we were there 10 minutes or 5
hours...  you either have the force, or you get out of the way
