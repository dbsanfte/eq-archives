}Bluntman and Chronic - clear Jay and Silent Bob reference.

If just being a reference to something is problematic, your name may be in 
trouble for:

And your beastie?  Isn't Bosra a city in Syria?  And I go down for my love 
of Brell's freshly-pressed grapes, of course.

My point, though, is that the reference could -easily- be incidental.  
Googling on the word chronic doesn't dig up a page that refers to 
marijuana (much less Chasing Amy) in the first two pages of hits.[1]  
Chronic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic lung disease, chronic 
renal failure, chronic illness, chronic myofascial pain syndrome, blah 
blah blah.

If just being construable as a drug reference is enough, would you ban 
someone named Budd?  Even if her last name is Rosey?  And I suppose anyone 
whose name includes the substring dope, horse, lid, pot, green, dime, etc, 
is going to need renaming.

I have no problem petitioning potsmokurr, or polpot, even.  But Kettlepot?  
What's wrong with that? :)  And similarly, if he had just the first name 
"pot", why, I'd ask him if he was a smith. :)

[1] on the third page, there's a link to Dr. Dre's album "The Chronic".  
Good enough for my drug-reference sensor.
