Wenglawks (the guy you need to talk to in Kael) spends most of his time in a
room surrounded by other (giant-faction) mobs. Try and do the quest there
and you die. He does sometimes come out and walk up towards EW a ways. You
can do the quest then while he's out of sight of the other giants, but he
doesn't stop when you hail him or give him stuff, so it's rather tricky.

Killing Ziglark is far easier, and he's only L25 or so. Just solo him and
then go kill a few dire wolves to make the faction back up. Or pay someone
hunting in SS to kill him and let you loot the key.
