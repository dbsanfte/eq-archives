Fine so if someone does that react that way...but thats not what an
inspect is....its simply looking, using your eyes, a basic skill
available to all and used everytime you walk into a room. The equipment
you can inspect is the stuff that is highly visible on the outside of you,
in your hands.

The inspect mechanism in the game is simply a mung put together to limit
graphics overload, you put several items under the same graphic and let
people go look using text...its a lot easier on the engine. For people to
construct a social faux pas system around a CPU saving mechanism is taking
things alittle far (IMO)....its not like they are searching through your
inventory which plainly WOULD be the kind of examination you suggest.
About the only issue where the simulation fails it is that rings are
visible when you wear gloves (but to avoid that would require more code
than to be honest its worth and whos to say rings aint big chunky things
that go over gloves in the EQ world).

Your main beef to be honest apears not to be people looking at you but how
people use that information, ie the begging for your kit more
specificially kit you happe to have in hand and are using like now. That
is a social issue and that is the behaviour pattern you should be (again
IMO) complaining about because if they do go full graphical (every item
having unique graphic) or even if inspect is done away it wont stop people
coking up and saying.....'wow cool uber black shield of doom, can I have
it' if they would have doe that once they get the name from an inspect.
Thats a player behvious issue (and one that could become rude) not the use
of the apparatus used to simulate a real environment.
