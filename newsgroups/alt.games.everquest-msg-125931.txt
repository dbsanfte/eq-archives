So Joseph Smith, Jun. (translator of the Book of Mormon) is no
relation to Joseph Smith, Sen. (one of the 8 witnesses, second
testimony)?

I will allow as how it's possible that JS Jun. isn't related to Hyrum
Smith or Samuel H. Smith; after all, Smith is a common name.
Unfortunately, according to the Church's own history, Hyrum and Samuel
were both JS Jun.'s brothers.

Further, according to the Church's own history, almost all of the
other witnesses were closely related to each other (David, Christian,
Peter jun., Jacob, and John Whitmer being brothers, Hiram Page being
brother-in-law to the Whitmers, and Oliver Cowdry being another
brother-in-law).  And lastly, Oliver was Smith's 3rd cousin.

What was that again about being unrelated?

Mormonism may be the most recently revealed word of God or not, I
don't know.  But if you're going to talk about it's history, read that
history first.
