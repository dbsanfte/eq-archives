As Kanjien mentioned, go to 'EverQuest Role-players'
(http://tinyurl.com/3bqej).  If you can't click the link the url is
www.everquestroleplayers.com.

The following was taken from the above site.

> Official RP Server
> *Firona Vie* - 5 RP guilds
> 
> Unofficial Servers that appear to have higher concentrations of
> RPers
> 
> *Xegony* - 7 RP guilds
> *Erollisi Marr* - 6 RP guilds
> *Mithaniel Marr* - 5 RP guilds


I would not say this is in stone in any way.  This was based on the
number of guilds registered with everquestroleplayers.com.  So there
may be other servers with a far greater number of individual
role-players, but fewer guilds, or they've just not registered at the
site.

Whether or not a server flourishes in RP is more about the consistent
in game role-playing by the players themselves, more than how many
RPers are on a given server.  Numbers will certainly help that and the
more role-players there are on a server the higher the probability you
will find friends or even a guild that fits you, but still, RP is in
the players doing it, not always the server or the statistics.

I can't say I'm not bias towards Emarr.  It's nice to see that Emarr is
considered the #2 RPing server to date.
