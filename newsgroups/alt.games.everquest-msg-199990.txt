My druid is level 62 and I do not think I have "hit" anything or carried a
weapon (other than epic weapon) since about level 25 or so.  I did find that
for the plat a Smoldering Brand made a nice weapon.  I also used a Velium
Etched Bone Mace for the +3 wis it carries.  However if you are level 30 or
higher I would say to get a Cone of the Mystics for your Primary hand.  Thsi
combined with a Testament of Vanear, a Charred Guardian Sheild, or a Crystal
Chitin Sheild in Soconday is a nice way to go.

Good luck!
