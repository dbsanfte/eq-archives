Interrupts in combat are affected indirectly by your defensive skills
and gear, the harder you get hit the more likely you are to be
interrupted (or so it has always appered to me).  When you're on a
slope turning is more likely to change your location, so it's best
not to turn during a cast on a slope.  But Rumble's problem is
probably lag, the server has him predicted to be somewhere slightly
different from where he really is when it registers his position at
the start of his cast, this is what spinning and/or delaying takes
care of for you.  When fighting in hilly zones like FM I generally
stop, turn, and wait a second or so, this usually does the trick.
Also, I noticed a big drop in these stop-to-cast interrupts when my
channelling skill went over 200, dunno if that was real or imagined
tho.
