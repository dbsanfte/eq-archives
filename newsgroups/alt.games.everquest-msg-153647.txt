 Yeah, I'm sure they'll get right on that. Grats on whoever has their VT
key complete because Emperor encounter will probably be finished
'retuned' around these changes sometime in 2012. Ring of Vulak anyone?
Took them long enough to actually fix it. I'm guessing they'll never get
around to retuning it. I seriously doubt they have the time to get
around to all the large encounters in a timely manner.
