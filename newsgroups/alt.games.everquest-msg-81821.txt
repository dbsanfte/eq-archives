Another interesting place I have seen this happen is actually inside
Freeport.  Orcs get under the map by running into the town wall and
disappearing, another place it can happen around Freeport is involving trees
outside the city gates.  I know this happens, because I was killed in the
tunnel leading between West and East Freeport by a Deathfist orc that noone
could see.  So be prepared to zone while in FP as well(If you've started a
crappy human Nec just to see what it's like to play one, no twinks)
