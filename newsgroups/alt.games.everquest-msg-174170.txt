Actually, I listen to both types of music.... country, and western.
Anyways, country music is pretty much the only stuff that's currently being
produced that I can listen to.  Current country is what rock and roll used
to be back when it was still good.  Long live the Eagles.

Currently, though, I'm starting to develop quite a taste for Jazz.  Long
live Miles Davis.  Long live Duke Ellington.  Long live Ella Fitzgerald.
