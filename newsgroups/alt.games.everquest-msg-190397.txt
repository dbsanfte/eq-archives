That doesn't mean that a shaman is a better powerleveler.  He just
cant help the noob turnover mobs as fast as a druid, meaning the
skills have a better chance of keeping up.

Powerleveling has a drawback, and that is that skills may fall behind.
 By definition, the better job you do at powerlevling, the faster
skills will fall behind.
