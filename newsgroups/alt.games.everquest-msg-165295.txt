Ah.  And how does this square with your position on inherited wealth?
And, while we're at it, are you then advocating making the U.S.
education system open to all people worldwide?  After all, why should
you get preferential treatment over some Nigerian, or Indian, or
Rumanian, or ...?

Nobody in this world has ever achieved or received anything solely
on the basis of unalloyed merit.  Being born at all makes your very
existence a gift.  Surviving early childhood is an exercise in
dependency.  You're bitching because you encountered unfairness in
your life.  Tell me, who in hell has never encountered unfairness
or privilege?

Yeah, a lot has changed.  But a lot more has remained the same.  And
white vs. black racism is one helluva lot more damaging than black vs.
white racism simply because there are so many more sandboxes open for
us whites to play in (not more wrong, but more damaging, and damage is
very relevant to the issue).

Really?  So veterans preference on the civil service examinations
is not right?  So denying Pierre Francaise a job or schooling just
because he's not a U.S. citizen is not right?  So denying a convicted
felon the right to vote or use firearms is not right?  Argue from
absolutes and you're not gonna like where that takes you.  I for one
am very much in favor of jailors discriminating between persons
convicted in court of criminal actions and sentenced to serve time
and persons who have not been convicted and sentenced.

And how do you propose that we deal with the millions of people who are
still sufferring from the many violations of the equal protection clause
that have been sanctioned and/or tolerated in the past?  And the shadow
of America's racist past is far more substantial and menacing than you
would have us believe.  A few decades of legal barriers to institutional
racial discrimination are hardly sufficient to erase something ingrained
into our culture.  Just ask the people of the former Yugoslavia how easy
it is to eliminate prejudice and hatred by legal means.
