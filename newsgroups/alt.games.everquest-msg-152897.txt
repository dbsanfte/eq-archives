I think he suggested EQW because it gives you more flexibility.  EQ does
things to try to make it hard for other things to run.  EQW gets around
that.  In particular, if you run with EQW it changes your problem from "how
do I shut down this weird program?" to "how do I shut down this normal
program?".

For instance, here's something that comes to mind for WinXP (yes, I saw that
you have 98SE...I don't know if 98SE has anything similar to this).  Start
EQW as a scheduled task.  When you setup a scheduled task, you can specify a
maximum amount of real time to let the task run.  Presumably, after that
amount of time, it will kill EQW, and that should get you out of EQ.

I doubt this would have a chance of working without EQW, because to the task
scheduler, the task you run would be the EQ patcher, which is long gone when
you are in EQ.
