You know, I read this page (it was strangely captivating, like watching 
Jerry Springer or something) and I couldn't help thinking of the little 
mantra bit being sung to the tune of the Culture Club War song (War is 
stupid, and people are stupid... that one):

Truth is Cubic.
Time is Cubic...
Life is Cubic....
Form is Cubic..
Family is Cubic..
Village is Cubic..
Evil is cubeless.
Self is cubeless.
God is cubeless.

Now, there was an out-and out challenge there... perhaps the lizard vs 
reptile lobby might like to divert their energies to it? To quote the above 
webpage:
