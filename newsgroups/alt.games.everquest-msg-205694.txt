With Sony's money.

Which was doubtless an option in the agreement under which Sony

funded Verant.

Sony did not see EQ as a "sure thing", so they allowed the folks who
had that vision to take on part of the risk in exchange for a bigger
gain if they succeeded.  This is a very normal business practice.
Without Sony the folks who envisioned EQ would've had to find another
sugar daddy, and it was the incredible success of EQ that got all
those other outfits interested in funding MMOGs.  Hell, if EQ had
been done wholly in-house it might have failed badly, there is no
certainty that Sony would've given the folks who made it as much
freedom as Sony employees as they had in quasi-independent Verant.
