Damage Caps are at levels 10 and 20.

At level 10 the cap is 19
At level 20 the cap is 29

A stregnth bonus can also be added which can bump the max damage up a
couple of points.

You also need to have a weapon that can hit the cap (or higher once
you pass level 10 or 20). For example a Centi-Longsword (14/27) will
be resticted by the Damage Cap below level 20, but a 3/23 Dagger would
not.
