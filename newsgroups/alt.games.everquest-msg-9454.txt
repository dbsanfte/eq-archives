Is this post off-topic? I don't think so. Does it matter? Not really.

This is usenet, so different groups tend to vary quite a bit. Come over to
comp.lang.c, for instance. I doubt you'll find a single off-topic post that
is not responded to with "This post is off-topic for this newsgroup.." --
it's a standard-heavy group. Go over to FAng, and look at how off-topic it
is.

Different people have different expectations of what usenet is. All groups
are not the same, and it's something you have to live with. Everyone gets to
adapt in some way to everyone else. One of my favorite quotes, stolen from
Richard Heathfield's sig:

"Usenet is a strange place." - Dennis M Ritchie, 29 July 1999.
