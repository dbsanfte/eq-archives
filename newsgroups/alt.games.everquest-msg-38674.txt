I had a problem of Zone crashing, which was corrected when I re-installed
windows (due to a problem unrelated to EQ) but it started coming up
again...so I emailed tech support, who then asks me for a bunch of
information about my computer. I send it to them, and most of the methods
they tell me to try I told them I did in my original message, which was
attatched to the current message...

Now EQ won't even start up, so even if I wanted to cancel my account due to
lousy tech support, I couldn't.
