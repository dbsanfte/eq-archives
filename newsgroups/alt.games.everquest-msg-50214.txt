    Anything that causes death in transit, sure, I'll go with that. Remember
my perspective here: I'm a cleric. I have no JBoots, and my invis item is a
PITA Larrikan's Mask. So everything you take for granted when travelling I
have to constantly buy more of / recharge.

    I've yet to see a full group in any of those zones GTG and NOT move in.
Sometimes they do daft things, like the three left corner groups in Velk's
the other day, but they don't sit around.

    Doesn't mesh with what I saw. I zoned in visible, not invisible, and got
no aggro from the three spawn. I'm a small race with no SG faction hits
against me, but I wouldn't think that would make a difference.

    And Invis never drops. :P My experiences are likely coloured by the one
trip, where the druid lost Camo close enough to a Siren. He didn't have a
chance to outrun it, because it charmed him as an opening move. And since he
had See Invis up he went after the Warrior. It was a mess, although we all
lived.

>SG, you can use the "self-succor" tactic.

    Your server must have slack GMs. On our server you get the big boot in
the ass for trying crap like that. And they DO like to hang out invis and
/anon just to catch folks.

    Sigh, I'm tired of arguing the point. All the low-end guilds on our
server raid Fear and Hate for armour. Yes, RAID. People below level 55 do
that kind of thing, you know, and the zone is set up for it.

    /agree - if they upped the number of "key teleport item" drops, would
you still have the same issues with it?

    We must be butting heads over definitions here. To me, anything that
requires more than one group to do is raid-level. Vox is raid content.
Nagafen is raid content. Stanos is raid content. Maybe none of these things
are raid content to your guild, as you cannot do them / see no point in
doing them, but it's raid content.

    And the Velious kings, and the odd turtle slaying. Compare with all the
loot in the game - not talking about a lot, are we? And when you kill the
named stuff after Aary, how many rots do you have? "A Young Halfling says,
'Thanks for the Whitestone Shield, Sang!'"
