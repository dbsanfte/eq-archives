Tower of Frozen Shadows, second to fourth floor. (Not all undead, but
lots.)

Lower Guk dead side

City of Mist.

Of those, CoM is probably your best bet. XP is insane there, and
probably two thirds of the mobs there are undead. Plus, it's just a
great, fun zone and there's some rare drops there which can net you some
nice cash if you happen to get them.
