/petition Listen you bastards, because the alarm failed to work as intended
my boss caught me online after he got back from lunch and now I'm
unemployed!  You'd better reimburse me my job NOW, jerkoff!

But regarding the actual question, I don't know the answer.  Nor do I know
how you get those content menus for the Reply To and Tell a Friend...unless
maybe it's on your menu bar on top?  If so, that's probably where the alarm
is as well.  I do like the alarm function though.  I mean, after 3.5 years I
really don't NEED it, but I do think it's kinda cool.
