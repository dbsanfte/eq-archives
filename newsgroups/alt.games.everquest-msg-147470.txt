That's a big misconception about Manaburn. Everyone seems to be under
the impression that it's essentially a guaranteed 8K blast everytime
with the chance for some spectacular crits. The spectacular crits part
is true, but the low end, and even the average, are reported among the
wizards to be considerably lower. 8K is actually a pretty damned good
manaburn for somebody with a modest manapool. I think 6 is far closer
the average.  Ragefire has 32 KHP. That means for four MB wizards to one
shot him, (sans crits) they all have to do 8K average. And that means
that all four of them better be packing one mean-ass collection of +mana
items to have a 4K manapool each.
