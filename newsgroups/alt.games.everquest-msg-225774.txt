<snip chat log>

So, a lot of the freaking out I've seen on some class boards has no basis -

- The opening system is ONLY for pure melee.
- The limited endurance pool Hybrids get is ONLY for the disciplines being 
  moved to the new system.
- These skills are in addition to all existing skills, so they 
  represent a gain in power.
- Warriors will get a new skill that allows them to generate aggro 
  without an opening, as well as skills to work with openings.
- You get a new UI box with hotkeys for the spells (bindable to the 
  keyboard)  (meaning already crowded hotkey banks won't get more crowded.
- Most of the <60 level skills are vendor buyable.
- Taunt now gives a success/failure message
- Changes to go live on the Dec. 16th patch.
