Oh dear, you do indeeed seem confused.

I agree with you, everyone is entitled to their beliefs, and titan is
certainly entitled to his. MB seems to be questioning titan's beliefs,
rather than his right to express them.

After all, your post could be guilty of the same crime you have accused MB
of, couldn't it?


As regards the FAQ;

many alt newsgroups have FAQ's. I am always willing to discuss changes and
additions to it. Especially regarding any factual errors.

It is not a manifesto of the Taras party. It was made to help people,
(including me) understand the game a little, and some people have told me
that it has helped them. If I get enough posts or e-mails telling me to stop
posting it, I shall do so.

As has been frequently stated, I merely compiled it, and had very little
hand in the writing of it.
