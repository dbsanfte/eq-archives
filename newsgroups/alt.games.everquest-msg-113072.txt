Ok, before I begin, let me say I'm an experienced EQ player, and I had NEVER
heard this one before... And once I heard it I didn't believe it, and I
still don't believe it.

Had a group of low levels (13-17) in oasis. Needed another and see "15 rogue
LFG!". Send him a tell "come on over" his reply: "is there another rogue in
your group?" Thought the question was kinda strange, but I was fighting so I
just answered "no".

Rogue comes, we group up and we start fighting and we're doing well. Have a
cleric, war, pally, shaman, monk and the rogue. About 15 minutes later, the
pally has to go, so we are looking for another. I see "16 rogue LFG" and
send him a tell to come over. I announce to the group another rogue is
coming. First rogue throws a fit. "NO" he says. I ask "why not?" He says "if
you get another rogue in the group he'll take all my XP" I say "what are you
talking about?" and he says "you can't have two of the same class in a
group, they will only get half the XP then"

I try to explain to him it doesn't work that way. I tell him you can have a
group of 6 rogues and they will all get the same XP as a group that has only
one rogue. He says I'm wrong. I tell him I'm pretty sure I'm not. He says he
read it in the manual. I ask what manual. He says the Guide to Kunark.

Now, I hardly ever read manuals and am not totally sure what manual he's
talking about. I don't really need a million replies telling me I'm right
here, I'd just like to know if anyone has any idea where he got this idea.
