Cool....that newbie I gave some LoY junk too just last month (which is now
likely worth 5 times what it was) will be passing me even faster than
normal....They never do pay you back you know...no matter how grateful they
sound or how much the promise...the bastards ;�)

Multi accounts so it doesn't really effect me that much, think it's a
positive move tho, not just for twinking.

Nice way of saving time...depending how you set your spell book out.
Help with lazy bastards like me who can't be bothered to organise his
(druid's) spells...Oddly enough it's only the druid that is like this and I
find it just as easy as I do with my Shaman or Enchanter /shrug

Subscriptions to Casters Realm will fall....less alt-tab'ing for me anyway.

Hmmm I hope this feature can be turned off.
Seen this in SWG can't say I liked it.
Can see it's uses but just rather it wasn't forced.

Cool...Lower levels can be Werewolves too .
If you have proc'ing weapons you want this on you :�)

They'll be busy then...still somewhere new to hunt at the higher
levels...considering they were normally pretty empty as mid level zones.

I predict it will be wet :�)

Ooh look what's available if I want to go back Bristlebane :�/

Glad I grabbed my Luggald Dagger when I did then...they are pricey enough on
FV without a "no longer drops" inflation tag on it :�)

Just give us a real animation for 2hb and 2hp and not the stupid 1hp
animation....Hmm actually make all the Animations for Luclin like the old
model ones...they were far better anyway...except maybe H2H.
