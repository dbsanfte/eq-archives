Actually, the game was a present, so I am not recouping anything,
although I am sure it would make the person who gave the game to me
feel better if I got something out of it, instead of it being a waste
of money for them.  If I had realized that the game was
non-transferable, I would have downloaded the demo (if there is one)
before even opening the shrink-wrap.  I guess I was just being too
trusting.

Well, I think that you have pretty much convinced me that I shouldn't
bother trying to sell the game now, although I would like to find
someone who would get more enjoyment out of it than me.  I like the
suggestion about finding a family member or close friend to buy the
game off of me.  Unfortunately, the only people I know are grad
students and other professionals who really don't have the time to
play.

Thanks everyone for the information and advice, before I made a fool
of myself in the video game store.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
