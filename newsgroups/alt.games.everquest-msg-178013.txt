Nobody

Direcharm was situational, but yeah, also kinda overpowering.
Anyway theres a huuuuge difference between a hasted mob hitting for 200(?
been a while).. and a hasted charmed mob hitting for 600+

Well yeah, but I meant who else can do that without their high end PoP charm
spells...  I don't think "chanters" need nerfing, or "chanters" are
over-powered.. I think the high-end charm spells are over-powered, and that
includes necros and druids (who can do it even more safely than chanters,
albeit with more limitations)

Let me rephrase it...

Who else can get an AA inside 15 minutes, without using a high end charm
spell?  Heck who can get an AA/30mins sustained?
