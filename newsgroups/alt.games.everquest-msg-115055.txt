Greetings,

Yes, F10 selects Full Screen mode - sometimes called transparent mode.

Its also important to note carefully the button marked:
SCREEN SAME RESOLUTION
in the Options / Display panel,

this controls whether the small style screens such as spell-book are either:

* windowed within a black border - in this mode the screen change is
immediate as it uses the same overall screen resolution, so the screen does
not flicker and reset.
* full-screen - in this mode the screen changes res so the spell-book fills
the screen - it takes a few seconds as the screen flickers and resets
between modes


Note also, that in transparent mode:
each window can be switched on and off
each window can be moved and resized

this is explained (and more) in the MANUAL - its in the EQ folder called
EQmanual_supplement.DOC
