Most casters have some method of see invis, so caster v caster this should
not be an issue and I'd make some rule about healing/medding while not
actively participating in combat to stop the binding while hidden or medding
while invis.

Wouldn't suggest Bazaar, zone is hard on the frame rate and the levels that
"hang" there could (if they so chose) cause you a lot of grief.
I'd stick with the Arena, get all a bind outside the PvP area and don't
choose a weekend night to hold it.
Couple of high 50's/60's to play crowd control.
The emptiest zone to try this, imo, is Sth Qeynos but you could still have
faction issues (guards are easy to gain faction with, Steel Warriors, not
so)
