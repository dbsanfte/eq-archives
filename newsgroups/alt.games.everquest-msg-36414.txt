I saw a guy who ran into a feature he didn't like, immediately assumed
it was a bug, by his own admission, harassed VI for weeks at least
over it, then went on a rampage, insulting and berating VI. It was
something he could have EASILY found out was not a bug by simply
asking or doing MINIMAL searching on the web. Instead, he chose to
slam Verant's "lazy asses" and try to start some crusade against them
over it.

Now, if that's not worth "tearing him apart", what the hell is?
