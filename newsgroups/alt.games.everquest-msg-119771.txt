Three years the game has been out. The media has been slavering over
the chance to dig into it that whole time. In that time, they've found
ONE EverQuest player who committed suicide. With suicide being the
number three caused of death in the 15-24 year old range, how many
people duing that same time committed suicide who played baseball or
football or were cheerleaders, but got no media attention?
