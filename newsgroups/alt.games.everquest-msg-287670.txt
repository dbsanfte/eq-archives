It appears a lot of the racials are getting changed to be more
beneficial and hopefully balanced.( Is it really a =93balance=94?)
Orc
Hardiness now reduces the duration of stun effects by 15%
Troll
Racial Passive "The Voodoo Shuffle": Reduces the duration of all
movement impairing effects by 15%. Trolls be flippin' out mon!
Berserking: no longer has an activation cost of energy/rage/etc
Dreanei
Gift of the Naaru: now scales based on the higher of either the
caster's Attack Power or Spell Power
Shadow Resistance: reduces the chance to be hit by Shadow spells by 2%
Dwarf
Frost Resistance: reduces the chance to be hit by Frost spells by 2%
Racial Passive "Mace Specialization": Expertise with Maces and Two-
Handed Maces increased by 5.
Undead
Shadow Resistance: reduces the chance to be hit by Shadow spells by 1%
(yes, this is lower than the other resistance racials)
Will of the Forsaken: removes any fear, sleep, or charm effect (no
longer has a lasting immunity).
Night Elf
Quickness: reduces the chance to be hit by melee or ranged attacks by
2%
Nature Resistance: reduces the chance to be hit by Nature spells by 3%
Tauren
Endurance: now scales based on base health, to be tuned to
approximately a 5% heath increase if the player were wearing green
quality gear
Nature Resistance: reduces the chance to be hit by Nature spells by 2%
Gnome
Escape Artist: the freeing effect can no longer be resisted
Arcane Resistance: reduces the chance to be hit by Arcane spells by 2%
Blood Elf
Mana Tap: ability removed (partially integrated into Arcane Torrent)
Arcane Torrent: restores 15 energy, 15 runic power, or 6% of mana to
the Blood Elf (along with the current 2s silence effect)
Magic Resistance: reduces the chance to be hit by spells by 2%
Human
Perception: changed to a passive, now grants one character level of
passive stealth detection
Racial "The Fall of Humanity": Feign death which may trick enemies
into ignoring you. Any threat is restored versus enemies still in
combat upon cancellation of this effect. 5min cooldown
Racial Passive "Human Supremacy": The dominance of Humanity is
evidenced by having one more racial bonus than normal. Actually, make
that two counting this one. (just a tooltip, no actual functionality)
I=92m sure that the undead players will get angry, they=92re the only one
race which will get nerf.
