Maybe we're thinking of different things, but shouldn't Orlun _NOT_
be drawing  aggro...in pretty much any fight?

250-300, FAST quads.  I mean, fast.  Like he's
wearing a Cloak of Flames fast or something
;-).  He IS slowable (or at least he was up to a
few months ago..haven't tried again in a long
while), but this was also not via spell, it was via
rogue-made master-level poison.  He lifetaps,
he harm touches, and he summons.

Did I mention he hits fast?
