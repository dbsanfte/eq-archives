}Trouble is, there really *isn't* that much else along that line.
}I did think of this, after our exchange.  I know you hunt in SF a lot

}bored-out-of-his-mind cleric camping Rage, who would undoubtedly look

}But may I suggest to you that SF isn't the norm?

No, SF isn't the norm, but there's plenty of equivalent scenarios.  In 
many zones that aren't SF, I've come across clerics that are obviously 
PLing either a friend, or themselves on a second box.  And the thing about 
PLing is that you frequently only use about 10% of the cleric's mana, 
especially if they got KEI before they headed out.  And, on top of that, 
the cleric in question is usually at least almost as bored as the Ragefire 
camping cleric in the earlier example.  I don't know about others, but 
I've had my donations turned down by such clerics rather often. :)
