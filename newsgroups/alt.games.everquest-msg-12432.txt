While I was trying to get to sleep last night, but still thinking about EQ
as I'd been playing far too long, this occurred to me: Where are all the
females?

Seems to me that most mobs races in Norrath don't seem to have any females.
When was the last time you saw a female goblin/kobold/gnoll/etc? One wonders
how they manage to reproduce so much...
