 >BUT...let's just say I did..would I really care?

I don't group a lot outside of my guild either
but and, like you, I rarely ask for ports/rezzes/buffs
from people passing by. Early on in my life on the
server I'm on, one (or two?) guilds were 'frozen out'
by the rest. I'm a little fuzzy on the details because
I was pretty much focused on learning what the heck
I was doing and staying alive and only caught bits
and pieces of the situation but the basics were that
the guilds did something the other guilds disliked
and so the other guilds basically blackballed them.
Those guilds were defunct within a couple of weeks.

With LDoN being group-based as it is, it would seem
that a person who consistently screwed people over
would have a very short career in the dungeons,
even without the 'no rezzes, no ports, no buffs'
problem to deal with.
