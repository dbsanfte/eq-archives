No.  The original purpose of the test was to determine whether displayed
AC directly affected combat resolution.  Note that what I was interested
in was displayed AC.  Period.  Holding level equal would have placed a
restriction on the test that would have invalidated it.  The point was
to show that if you look only at displayed AC you haven't got a very
good idea how tough you are.  Even if the level-obsessed sheep are
right, and level is key (it isn't) while Defense skill has no more
effect than Conjuration skill on melee, that simply supports my
demonstration that displayed AC isn't worth squat.

Please demonstrate for me this intrinsic effect on your passive defense
in melee, exclusive of any change in Defense skill.  I await you report
of a repeatable test.

My statement is based on my experience.  Increases in Defense skill are
golden, increases in level give a bit of safety margin from the added
hp.  It becomes strikingly obvious when you jump a low level character
a few levels with quests and then go back to fighting.  You start out
getting kicked around just as bad as you did before you bumped your
level (or worse if you go after tougher mobs), tho your hp bar drops
slower since you have more total hp.  After you've meleed enough to get
your Defense skill up life gets much easier.

No, I just noticed that passive defense in melee seems pretty simple,
once you realize that your displayed AC has nothing to do with it.
So I am slowly gathering hard numbers to demonstrate how it works
(the first test debunked displayed AC, no matter how many sheep bleat
endlessly about level, the point was to show that displayed AC is
not at the root of combat resolution).

Your point would then have no bearing on my tests.

See above.

Displayed AC has no effect, because it is synthesized outside the combat
system using different calculations than the combat system uses.  It is
eye-candy pure and simple.

Again, displayed AC is surely based on the numbers that go into the
combat resolution system, but it is outside of the system and gives
an over-simplified assessment of your actual ability to withstand
attacks.

I have never set foot on the Vox/Naggy treadmill, nor will I ever do
so.  Verant's approach to assuring rarity of "special" items (create
bottlenecks that pit the players against one another) sucks donkey
balls and I refuse to buy in.

No, by not holding level constant I have _made_ my point.  Varying
the level of my test subject allowed me to contrast Defense skill
(the biggest variable in attack avoidance) with armor (the biggest
variable in damage mitigation), and thereby show that displayed AC
means jack.  Remember, the entire _point_ of the original test was
to show that displayed AC isn't what determines your defensive
ability.  AC is not a stat.  It is eye-candy.
