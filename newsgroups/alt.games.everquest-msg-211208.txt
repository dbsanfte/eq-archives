Hi Guys, Having recently rebuilt my PC, thankfully not losing the EQ
directory (3.5gb) I have found a small problem..
When you start the game, accept the EULA etc, you get to the Froglok screen
with the 'connect' 'options' display.. but for some reason the background
image is corrupted, I can only see half of the Froggy..
I have no doubt they will change all of this once LDON goes live, but I
wanted to know if anyone knows the name of the file so I can delete it and
download it again.
I have tried images, skins.. all the 'normal' files.. but as nothing in the
game is normal.. I am at a bit of a loss

Nayte
