Monks have quite a few special attacks, although I agree there seems
to be little reason to pick any but your best one.  Still, I think
you'll see the same complaint with most melee classes, its attack on,
keep up with the special attack of choice (kick, bash, whatever)
and wait for mob to die.

If you want to be more active in combat, try a bard.  Busy busy
busy, and lots of tactical changes you can make, quite dramatic
ones.
