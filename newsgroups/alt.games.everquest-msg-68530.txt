When you say something as extreme as "Verant doesn't give a crap about
their customers.." you are trolling.

There have been MANY problems/bugs since release. Your mistake is in
thinking that they are somehow done intentionally or on purpose. 

>Down with the dissenters! 

No...Down with "Trolls"
(That is what your original post was after all.)

>Down with those who wish to share their problems!  Down with
>people who seek help!  

You posted an inflamitory and ridiculous comment. The closest you came
to sharing a problem, was revealing your total lack of understanding
and paranoia about Verant Interactive's attitude towards customers.

>I'm an asshole because their software crashed my machine and I
>was unable to get any help repairing the damage they caused.

I find it hard to believe that EQ:SoL or the patcher damaged your PC.
No TSR's (Terminate and Stay Resident) are loaded. No system DLL's or
VXD's are replaced, and no low-level Registry entries are added or
changed.

>I'm a prick
>because I've had the *gall* to actually complain about this! 

Instead of wasting time complaining, you could have posted questions.
There is more than enough tech knowledge in this group to solve almost
any problem.

>Jesus, what a fucking retarted newsgroup.

I think you will find the "retardation" only manifests itself in posts
written by spoiled children throwing a tantrum.

Cheers
