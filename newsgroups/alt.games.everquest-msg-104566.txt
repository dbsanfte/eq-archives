How is bard damage-shield stacking an exploit?  One of the nice things 
about bards is that our stuff DOES stack with other classes, though it 
very, very rarely stacks with other bardsongs.  I certainly never knew 
about the Symbol songs stacking, and I suspect you don't know what you're 
talking about either.  Here's a hint, with one exception, no bard buff 
lasts over 18 seconds, and the exception is a self-only buff to make some 
songs better.  Finally, how could a bard solo Sontalak, and I'm serious 
here.  I think I know what answer you are going to give, and to that I 
say, bullshit.  Yes, you could charm mobs and send them in against Sont 
and keep doing that until you kill Sont, but you can only charm mobs level 
51 and below, a charm lasts UP TO 18 seconds, and used 20 mana each.  A 
bard with 800 mana is LOADED, so you're talking about about 10-12 minutes, 
and you need to be doing about 8000hp/minute, or 125hp/second of damage to 
do it within a single bar of mana.  
I'm sure bards do exploit, but no more than any other class.  In fact, 
based on 16 months of reading various bard forums, I would say I've seen 
many, many more posts complaining about exploits than promoting them.  In 
fact, in the past couple weeks there were a couple different posts about 
reporting exploiters, ESPECIALLY bards because the good ones worked too 
damn hard to have some idiot give bards a bad name.
You probaly think that bards can still charm guards, because someone 
charmed Inny 2.5 years ago.
