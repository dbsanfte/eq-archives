No, they don't.  SOE is lying about this, as is obvious from the fact
that there has not been a huge hue and cry about the new Knight discs
from the Warrior community.

The new Knight discs mitigate some incoming melee damage, and they
are discs not spells, that is about the extent of their similarity
to Defensive.

Defensive reduces DI damage by 45% (net 50% with Warrior intrinsic
DI reduction) for 3 minutes with no limit to the damage mitigated,
and the Warrior suffers a severe penalty to his melee damage while
it is active.  The level 69 Knight discs (extremely difficult for
non-raiders to obtain) reduce all melee damage by 25% for up to 30
seconds with a cap of 10,000hp on the damage mitigated, and no
penalty to the Knight.  (The level 61 disc is far easier to obtain
but has a 6,000hp cap on damage mitigated.)

Differences:
Defensive has no cap on damage mitigated,
- Knight discs absorb a set maximum amount of damage.
Defensive lasts 180 seconds,
- Knight discs last a maximum of 30 seconds.
Defensive blocks up to 42% or so of incoming damage (lotta variables),
- Knight discs block exactly 25% of incoming damage.
Defensive stacks with Vie and weapon Guard procs,
- Knight discs overwrite Vie and Guard procs (i.e. 25% = 15%).
Defensive allows a Warrior to tank a mob he could not tank without it,
- Knight discs won't allow you to tank a mob you can't tank without.

These are useful discs, a Paladin or SK will have greater safety
tanking some mobs that they can already tank with significant risk.
They are not however anywhere near as powerful as Defensive.

If you're wondering how limiting that 10k cap on damage mitigated is,
the only parse I've seen of Guard of Righteousness lasted all of 13
seconds before it wore off, the Paladin in question died 4 seconds
later (mobs with 3k melee DPS will do that to you, I guess).

At the highend Warriors are top dogs for aggro, and you can see
from the example above that they remain overwhelmingly superior
tanks as well.

Even in the mid-game, a 30 second disc isn't going to let Kaev
tank any mob he can't already tank, it'll just buy more time for
slow to land on mobs that are likely to kill him unslowed.
