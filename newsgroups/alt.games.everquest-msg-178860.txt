There was a good chart on the Phank site <www.phank.com> for a few days, 
maybe if you email them they'll send you a copy of it.  I checked the 
archive on the site and it's not on there.
I highly recommend Phank.  Their site is funny.  They go to high level 
areas and take SS's of the fight, except it usually ends up being a SS 
of a pile of player corpses.  Yinnyang updates the site roughly once a 
week.  Anyone who says anything remotely funny in guildchat while Yinny 
is on is subject to SS'ing.  The best thing is they have alot of fun, 
they don't always get the target but they have a great time doing it.
