Calling all Rangers out there!
Hi.  I'm a L35 woodie ranger on The Seventh Hammer, and I seem to have
run into a skill cap on 1hb, at 176
http://interealms.com/ranger/skills/#CWeapon reports it as 200, but I
would like to hear from any rangers who have it higher than this.

I know 1hb probably isn't the best skill for a ranger, but once I max
out 1hs upon gaining a new level, I try to max it out anyway, "just in
case" some cool weap comes out.  I am using a Screaming Mace, and I
use it in my primary hand.

So, if any of you rangers out there have 1hb > 176, then let me know!

Thanks
