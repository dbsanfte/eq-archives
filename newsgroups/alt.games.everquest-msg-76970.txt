EverQuest, a great game. You pay each month to have the pleasure to loiter in 
the lands of norrath.

But, since last month, the pleasure has gone. Luclin was released, and 2 days 
later, the game started to crash. I have a ATI Rage 128 Pro card. Great card. 
Works well on nearly every game i think (all other i have).

But now, when i click my inventory, the screen starts to flash. Result : i dont 
loot anymore, i fear to play. I dont want to buy another card, so i decided not 
to pay next month. I stop Everquest until the problem isn't solved. 


Verant won ! Gratz !

If you have the same problems, please add a reply to this post, to show Verant 
how the problem is big. And sorry for my poor english, im french.
