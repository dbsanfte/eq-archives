Because apostrophes *are* used for plurals in some cases:

(1) letters and words used as such: mind your p's and q's
(2) some types of abbreviations: Ph.D.'s, M.P.'s
(3) numbers: the 1990's, roaring 20's

Not to say the original poster was correct in his usage of apostrophes,
but if you know the correct rules of spelling, you'll sound smarter
when you rant.
