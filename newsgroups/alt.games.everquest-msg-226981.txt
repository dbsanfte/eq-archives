A while back, was mentioned in the MOTD.

I have no idea what the devs are up to with PoM at the moment.  It's
hard to keep track actually.

PoM 1.0

Entry via NToV.  Many quest drops, zone seemingly abandoned at some
point with huge swathes of it either unpopulated or unfinished.  By
far and away the weirdest zone in the game before or since.  Fake
bridge long before the Deep was thought of, dispell traps.  Many mobs
non-KoS.

PoM 2.0

Entry via GD.  99% of PoM 1.0 mobs gone, replaced with standard
kill-named-for-loot mobs.  Fake bridge remains but traps no longer
dispell.  New ring event in the Chess Board area.  Most things KoS
(Skunks, Shrooms at ZI).  Some decent loot from normal named (FT II
Robe, a decent 50 HPs belt which went to a good friend's Rogue twink,
leather classes 50 HPs head piece, leather classes bracer which went
to the bin, too many Amusing Baubles to count, a Regen II ring which
never dropped when I was there and more.  Distinct named would always
drop loot. )

Bristlebane himself dropped Ssra/VT raid quality loot but poor RvR due
to problems with the encounter, if you could kill him most likely the
loot rotted.

Passable xp inside the castle and the garden (maze? looked like a
garden to me) due to mobs being 60+.

PoM 3.0

God knows.  Some seem to think this was PoM 1.5 that somehow found
it's way onto live servers in error one patch or when PoM 2.0 was
repopped manually for some reason.
Classic sign of unfinished zone - naked human models for mobs in odd
positions.  Most mobs back to non KoS.  Replaced hastily on most
servers with PoM 2.0.
