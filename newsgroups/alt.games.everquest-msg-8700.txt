Well regarding this, it CAN work if they have a single login server for both
games.  (Heck it's easier to track online Sony players that way anyway).
That's the main way EQ stops multi-playing from occurring.

Can this work?  Absolutely.  Will it cost way too much for Sony?  Absolutely
not.  Here's why:

    I do not know for sure, but I have seen strong evidence that the EQ
servers are clusters.  That means multiple machines looking like one, big
server.  I won't get into much of the geek-speak but it's more stable and
upgradeable than big, big systems because if one machine goes down (or needs
to be upgraded) then the entire server keeps working.  Brief evidence noted:
several zones go down at once...probably because it is one of the machines
in the cluster.
    If this is the case then Sony's golden.  They set up a cluster for a
login server (if it is not already).  Then they have it handle the logins
for both games.  Then the more people added they just slap in another
machine.  Minimal downtime, and it increases the amount of people who buy
the software themselves.  Heck, a monkey could sell buying the new games to
players like me who are already in their billing system.

Keep me sharpened, though, gents.  I am for this, but, heh, like I have any
power to make them do anything.
