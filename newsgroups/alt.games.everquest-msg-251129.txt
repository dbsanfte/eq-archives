I am not sure what your definition of better is ... both classes are
very good and bring a lot to the table. To be more specific.


1. The mage is definately easier in the lower levels until the wizard
gets snare.  I died a lot with my wiz in this lvl range and can't
remember any deaths with the mage .. I am sure I had them but no where
near as many as the Wiz until he got snare.

2.  Both are good at the mid-levels ... the wizard outdamages the mage
if they are similarly equipped.

3.  No pet for the Wiz until he gets one at lvl 60.  That pet is only
good for beating on mobs backs though.  (Sword of Xuzl sp?).  The wiz
gives more of an adrenelin rush as he kites four mobs at once in this
lvl range. The wizard Familiar is a pet but he does no damage .. just
helps with mana and regeneration.

4.  Both are fun to play but different ... make one of each and give
them a go ... make you own decision.  You will certainly eat more
deaths with the Wiz at the lower lvls though just be aware of that.
You will end up with a more powerful character though.  Both at the top
end of the game have good utility.
