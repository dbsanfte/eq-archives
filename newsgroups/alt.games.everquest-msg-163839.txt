Hit send too soon a min ago

[Wed Nov 20 02:21:11 2002] You say, 'Hail, Charayan the Crusader'
[Wed Nov 20 02:21:11 2002] Charayan the Crusader says ''You stand before
Charayan, Crusader of Veeshan. I am the talon that justly strikes down our
enemies and shall fulfill our destiny in the trials of blood and vengeance.
I sense that the loyalty you bear toward the children of scale is strong but
the siren voice that has called you to us is still a whisper upon your mind,
and it is a song of curiosity and greed that fuels you yet. Since the dawn
of your creation, all of your kind has proven that without tangible reward
to do otherwise, your blades would be aimed for our hearts. But do not think
we fault you for merely this -- such shallow lusts have become a definition
of your kind, and we do not bear you ill will for it. However, the
[champions] are not as the others of Veeshan's brood and your past deeds
shall [not bear fruitful] in your dealings with us. ''
[Wed Nov 20 02:21:15 2002] You say, 'what champions'
[Wed Nov 20 02:21:15 2002] Charayan the Crusader rears upon her hind legs
and extends her wings once more in a glorious display, 'The Crusaders of
Veeshan are four champions of dragon kind who have dedicated their very
lives to the restoration of Kerafyrm's slumber and undoing that which your
kind has so ignorantly threatened this world with. Fate has given room for
nothing short of this declaration and the recent past has demanded our
attention and duty to be thus. Your kind, the second generation, has
carelessly shifted the destiny of all upon this world and it is your
ignorant and lustful actions that have forced us into existence as we are
now. Kerafyrm, the Sleeper, was well guarded for all these years not without
dire justification -- he cannot be destroyed by means conceivable by dragon
or second generation alike. We are those whose existence is to combat this
shadow and [keep it at bay], despite all costs and with all sacrifice.'
[Wed Nov 20 02:21:36 2002] You say, 'how will you keep it at bay'
[Wed Nov 20 02:21:37 2002] Charayan the Crusader says ''When Kerafyrm was
first recognized as a dire threat to this world, the four Warders were
chosen. The elders of the council knew that time's grace upon us was thin
and that the warders must be recognized as a temporary means of subduing
this threat. Before the great war that would yield Kerafyrm's incarceration,
the warders were instructed to mate with four dragons of pure elements as
their. The offspring of these unions would be trained for the undivided
purpose of fulfilling their predecessors' duties when their fate would
inevitably dawn. However, your kind have forced the apprentices into a [new
role], one that we had not anticipated, but such was our mistake to
overestimate and consider your kind the ability to rise above your debased
natures and shallow existence.''
[Wed Nov 20 02:21:39 2002] You say, 'what new role'
[Wed Nov 20 02:21:40 2002] Charayan the Crusader says ''When Kerafyrm was
awoken, the apprentices were called by the council to prepare for the hunt
and his recapture. The apprentices were not as agreeable to the council's
plan as they had anticipated and the Crusaders were born of our own accord.
For months the deliberations and cordial arguments raged, but all that would
eventually come would be the unspoken disapproval of the council and the
apprentices' self-imposed adoption of a new and more necessary duty. We have
come to Skyshrine to fulfill our purpose, but those passing months ushered
in an unseen darkness that the Crusaders had feared from the first movement
of Kerafyrm's eye -- the [ancients] returned.''
[Wed Nov 20 02:21:43 2002] You say, 'what are the ancients'
[Wed Nov 20 02:21:43 2002] Charayan the Crusader gives another bellowing
roar, her wings flaring outward in an intimidating and almost frightful
display, 'The Ancients are not to be trifled with, although your kind will
find your just retribution upon their fiery talons if we, the Crusaders,
cannot undo your ignorance. You ask for their [names, for their past and for
their meaning] to this perilous path that you have set us upon, and your
actions have earned you nothing less than the obligation to know the fullest
extent of what you have unleashed upon this world. But do not take these
words lightly, nor think yourself a hero standing in the fading shadow of a
great monster. Although those of you whom still bear allegiance to the Claws
of Veeshan will be demanded by the Crusaders to engage these monstrosities
of Veeshan's brood, you shall gain neither repute nor true victory if you
succeed in such a task.'
[Wed Nov 20 02:22:01 2002] You say, 'what names, for their past and for
their meaning'
[Wed Nov 20 02:22:01 2002] Charayan the Crusader says ''When Kerafyrm had
proven his mad, relentless nature that opposed all we had established since
the dawn of our existence, the elder council of the Claws of Veeshan ordered
Kerafyrm's destruction as an absolute necessity to escape existence as
slaves to the tyranny of a mad abomination. During this time, Kerafyrm had
established allies within the Velious nation -- amongst these allies were
four elders upon the very council that sought to destroy him. Kildrukaun,
the former Arch Priest of Veeshan and driving force behind the original
decree that forbade the existence of creatures such as Kerafyrm was the
first to betray the Claws of Veeshan. Vyskudra, the magnificent dragon of
the storms and only one of her kind to exist followed the lead of her patron
and master. Third was Tjudawos, the scholar of the council. Lastly was
Zeixshi-Kar, the general among the Claws of Veeshan who engaged within the
fledgling war with the giants of Kael that would last for centuries beyond
her departure. These four elders would be'
