I've gotten faction boosts that specifically say "AntoniusBayle", so it
seems to me he should be kicking around somewhere.  I suppose it could mean
I gained faction with his immediate subordinates, whoever they are......

Allakhazam's doesn't list Bayle in the Bestiary (at least not in any
Qeynos-related zone). There is a faction page related to him but it doesn't
say if he's in the game or not.
