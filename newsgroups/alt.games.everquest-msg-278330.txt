We dedicated one enchanter to chain mana-draining gaters (only certain
coloured mobs gate :) ) - it was 98% effective, every now and then we still
had one gate on us.

There are two reasons to 'crawl' through HoT rather than pulling to the
entrance, the first is gaters do happen, no matter how hard you work to
prevent them, the second is that once you've killed a few mobs, the time
taken to get the next ones back to the camp is so long, you'd be better
served killing them in the tunnels.

Whether you crawl or camp the entrance is really dictated by your resists,
if you need to hide your casters behind the walls to avoid the AE's then
you pull to the entrance, if you can ignore the AE's then you may as well
crawl.

The mobs in HoT are not mezzable, stunnable, charmable or snareable, so CC
is down to off-tanking.

If you do go to HoT, check out some guides on the web, the key one being,
door management :)
