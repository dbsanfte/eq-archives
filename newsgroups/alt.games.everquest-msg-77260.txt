You got good weapons. You chose the fast ones, with a quick accumulation
of damage bonus, a lot of fast hit aggro and caster interrupt. What
do you want more damage for? The only way you get more damage with
your money is buying extremely expensie weapons that keep the delay,
but add damage, which will be in the thousands of plat range. Your
weapons are pretty ideal for a warrior, as your job is taunt. If you
wanted to be the damage hero, you took the wrong class. Play a rogue
or wizard or monk. You can get yourself something like the Luclin
drop 'Strength of Grodan', an axe with 41 damage and 51 delay.
But that's not a warrior weapon, it's more of a Knight weapon. Lots
of damage, but slow -> low taunt. Not what you should do.

You said you're saving up for cobalt. Good idea if you'r enot in
an uber guild able to get you velious drops. *That* is what you
should concentrate on as a warrior. You are a tank. You don't do
the big dmage, you take it, get used to that thought. AC is king.
You can get (expensive/rare) armour later, that keeps the AC
but provides stats. Do not sacrifice AC for stats. 

Again: you are a punching ball and a taunter, nothing else as a
warrior.
