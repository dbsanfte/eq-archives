  You'll probably get different answers from different people regarding this
subject.  My own feeling is, if one person/group already has all of the
spawns in an area under control, and you came there with the intent to fight
whatever it is they're camping, it's stupid to stick around, because the
pickings are going to be slim and there's going to be competition and bad
feelings that most decent people will try to avoid.

  I think that, generally speaking, you should respect who was there first
and let them have all the spawns they can handle until they leave.  The only
time I might consider forcing someone out of a camp is if they have been
incessantly camping the same spot/mob almost nonstop for days (usually to
farm) and are monopolozing the spot.  In this case I would try to reason
with the person (try to convince them to share, or take a break)... failing
that, I might try to compete for the spot by getting the first shot and
claiming the mob, or I might /petition and invoke play nice policy.  I
haven't ever had it come to that, though.

  In your situation, it sounds like you just had a bunch of moronic higher
level players trying to muscle their way into the camp.  I probably would
have /petitioned and /reported that line about "pulling over you," since it
sounds pretty much like a threat to train you (I'm pretty familiar with the
geonid area, and it isn't exactly difficult to move your group to the
geonids, rather than vice versa.)  But it was likely a hollow threat anyway.
If you were killing the geonids more or less as they spawned, you could have
simply kept fighting the top or bottom four geonids, keeping them clear so
they'd never have the oppurtunity to train you, unless maybe they trained
you with spiders and tentacles... still nothing you probably couldn't
handle, unless it was a big train.  Essentially, they would be pulling for
you... while killing the mobs they pulled over you might technically be
considered KSing, I think if you /reported the threat to pull over you, most
GMs wouldn't take their side if they tried to get you in trouble for your
actions.

  Presuming they were there to gain experience/loot and not simply looking
for trouble, they would eventually realize that you aren't leaving and that
there aren't enough NPCs to sustain two groups, and they'd leave and fight
somewhere else.  Unfortunately, there are times when there are people who do
just seem out to annoy and frustrate others, and those are the people I
/petition and /report, before leaving to find something else to do.

  As for static spawns, if you're there first and make an offer to share, or
tell them they're leaving soon, and they STILL try to muscle you out of the
camp, I'd /report the accompanying threats and insults (usually when you're
dealing with someone of this level of immaturity and greed, there are such
threats and/or insults), and tell my guildmates and friends about the
person.  Usually they I'd leave, but I might stick around for a few spawns
to try to keep the camp, and give any GMs or Guides that might have popped
in an example of their KSing, training, or whatever other stunts they might
try and pull.
