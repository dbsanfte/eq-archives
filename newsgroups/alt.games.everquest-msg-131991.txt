At your level, I think you should be more concerned with delay rather
than damage. And, of course, the damage / delay ratio. (Look at your
weapon stats. Divide Delay into Damage ï¿½ the higher number, the
better.)

You should also focus on maxing all of your weapon skills. Lower delay
weapons will help here. The more often you swing, the more
opportunities you will have to increase your skill.

For 1hs, I would recommend a Langsaxe. It's the result of a quest in
Halas. You're probably too low to do the quest, but folks sell them
for around 20-25pp. I got mine for a High Quality Bear Pelt. Just
/auction in Everfrost and you'll find one in no time.

If that's not an option, a Forged Bastard Sword isn't too bad. Problem
is, you need a smith to make one.

Can't help you here. :)

To make plat, hunting HQ Bear Pelts is probably the best you can do.
Polar Bear Cubs drop them on occasion and you can often sell them in
the same zone. Depending on server, you may get 20-40pp each.

If you get the Langseax, which is magic, you could probably hunt wisps
in Qeynos Hills. Any Greater Lightstones you find can be turned into
the Gypsies in North Karana for a book that sells for about 10pp to a
vender.

If you're on Morell-Thule, give Aleheart or Highmark a /tell. I think
I have a Langseax in the bank you can have. If not, I can forge you
some ok weapons.
