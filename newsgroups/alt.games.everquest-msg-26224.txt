Yep the Damage/Delay ratio isn't much to write home about as such

SSoY     7.08 dam/sec
Icetooth claws or Cryst. Sword 7.93 dam/sec
BA Sword or Gleaming SS  7.24 dam/sec

But, the reason the Yak is so popular is the 75dd is proc's at 37th level.

Personally I am thinking I need to upgrade my 1hs (currently 2 Yaks) the
proc is something you come to rely on and occasionally you can go thru a
fight without seeing one. Unfortunately I can now also proc the Sword of
Skyfire and Glowing black sword (great weapons for duelling but not that
safe to use when hunting)

Thinking of dropping back to twin crystallised swords, again (used these
before I was close to 37th, then I changed to Yaks) as I often have
quickness (about 20% less delay) buff, due to my Shaman partner, so the
delay would be more like 24 than 29.

Of course I could stop my current level surge and start earning money to buy
something better but I'm on a bit of a roll now (5 evenings to get out of
45, not bad going)

To the original question, the Wurmy/SSoY is a tried and trusted combo, I
don't like the "Worm"Slayer myself but there are few 2hders that match it's
dam/delay for the price let alone 1hders, plus getting the procs from your
off hand Yak. Just hope the Warrior out damages you :ï¿½)

Skyfire and Glowing Black sword combo is good, 10/22 and 9/22 but once you
hit 45 you'll want to put them down.

After that everything gets into the high price bracket. I know, I've been
looking.

CF
I recon you would have been pleasantly surprised by the Yaks
