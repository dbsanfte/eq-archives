None is required. 

You said;

"you said smileys are unnecessary in the face of
superior writing."

You then quote me as saying something quite
different.

>>>Are you now claiming you're not being pompous?

Of course there is a response. You even quoted it.

You ask me "Are you now claiming you're not being
pompous?", and I answer an idiot like you, with a
quote from Derrida!!

I'll put you out of your misery.... YES, THATS
FUCKING POMPOUS.

See... no smiley required.

I don't respond to claims that the moon is made of
green cheese either.

Well... admitting you have a problem is a start.

What is "bad thought", cretin?

First, you need some sort of equipment to
distinguish between the two.

>He's falling to profanity now.

Just as an aside... who are you talking to?

I doubt that anyone else here is interested in
your ongoing education.

> We could point out the irony of that,

You don't have a relevant point, you never do.

I am glad you found it hilarious, it was meant to
be.

>>You seem far beyond the help of humble, overworked

>And yet, with a few simple words

What else does a simpleton like you have?

You weren't expecting something complex to
suddenly pop out of your brain were you?

And now, you seemed to have turned into Little
Jack Horner, wandering around repeating "What a
good boy am I"

>So, does all your worldly knowledge come from the songs you hear on

Yes, I listen to a lot of Derrida on the radio.
Know any of his songs?
