Yeah when I meet a monk I like, I'll usually send them a tell offering 
to change them money if they need it.  I hate that rule when I'm using 
my monk.

Did the guards aggro on you?  They usually yell it when they find your 
hand in their pocket.  And not all of them say it.  I've definitely had 
the gnolls at the spires say it multiple times though - but then I was 
pickpocketing the entire time I was fighting them.  The goblins in HHK 
have, otoh, never ever said anything.  I'm not sure what the difference 
is.

I don't think disarm traps works without an actual trap.  At least, 
after several days of having it on a directional key, *and* mapping it 
to other hotkeys while doing a Befallen run, it hadn't raised once.  Not 
that that's hard.  The axe 3 feet into Sol A works just fine - I just 
keep clicking it (or, when my right finger gets tired, hitting u with my 
left finger).

> Lock pick..  bleh I haven't even looked at that.  What I forsee myself

May I recommend you at least get started on both.  You have no idea how 
long those @#@!$ skills take to get up.

> Max lockpick, Max Sense trap, Max Disarm trap.

Befallen (second door is better, there's a rat and sometimes a skeleton 
that wanders through the top door that I keep 'trading' my lockpicks to 
when they pass by), nowhere - just map it to a directional key or to 
backstab key or both or whatever, Sol A.

> Whatever PP skill for epic.

Boring skill to raise outside of combat.  Map it to something else 
you're doing while fighting and lose the 1 dps ;p

I can't see why not, but then, this is EQ.  Ask in rogue channel?

Not until after I've milked it dry. :)

*g* Pets must have replaced bards as Sony's favorite class.  "In other 
news, Sony announced today that pets now have a 50% chance of turning 
around and charming their 'masters' and making them do all the dirty 
work."

Gyah.  I think mine is around 10?  Not enough groups let the rogue pull 
:p

Haven't bothered with throwing.  I like archery better.

It damn well BETTER.  I've been told that in duels, pets will raise 
skills, PCs won't.

> You want your defence up?  Stop evading :)

I was, until people started getting pissy at me for slowing down the 
kills.  Now it's starting to actually hurt to get hit.  Damn near died 
bringing a sarnak knight from 20 feet out in OT yesterday.
