That's all well and good for low levels.  Mid-50s the mobs take more
time to kill (remember, most of those 30-somethings are wearing gear
that many 50s would've drooled over a year ago), not only is Slow
worthwhile but if you don't have a Cleric it's necessary.  Maybe not
if you're using tactics that involve no melee characters at all, but
since I haven't taken a caster into LDoN I have no idea if anybody
is winning with pure caster groups (I have tanked for 5 casters, and
it almost succeeded, would have if we hadn't gotten off to a slow
start, easily finished our "kill 50" after time ran out).

Well, it is a game, why play if it isn't fun?  ;)
