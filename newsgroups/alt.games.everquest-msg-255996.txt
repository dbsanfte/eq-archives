You don't *have* to play RVR.. as a matter of fact they now have a totally
blue co-op server (kinda defeats the purpose if you ask me) or you can play
totally PVE to 50 in your home realm.

Yes, there are "battlegrounds" where you can fight the other realms. Within
these grounds there are keeps to capture and when a battleground is
"captured" by a realm that realm receives benefits. Most of the time it
turns into a "zerg fest" where everyone runs about willy-nilly trying to
get a kill but with proper planning it is something to watch. Things may
have changed since I left though.

If played correctly yes. If not (as in every other game) no. Then again the
death penalty is not really bothersome so if you take one for the team it's
not that really a big deal. And there was a time when stealthers were king
of RVR... till the "balancing". Look for more nerfing on both sides.

Question: If you could live forever, would you and why? Answer: I would not
live forever, because we should not live forever, because if we were
supposed to live forever, then we would live forever, but we cannot live
forever, which is why I would not live forever.
