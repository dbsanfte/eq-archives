    Ah, read carefully. It wasn't because they whined. It's because all of
them refused to roll for the rights to the next spawn. A smarter GM would
have then assigned each cleric a number and rolled for them.

    Honestly, I wish a GM would do something similar on every server. Do a
/broadcast telling all clerics that have all other parts of the epic
complete to assemble forces in Skyfire. Then spawn Ragefire for them, one
after the other. If they attempt to get in on this and don't have all other
parts complete, slap a warning on their account and suspend them after
removing the heart from their inventory. If they fail their one chance to
kill Ragefire, too bad, please leave, you get to camp it the normal way.
Clearing a fair chunk of the massive Ragefire backlog would make list
systems much more acceptable to people since they wouldn't be nine months
long. It might also drum into some people's heads that it's not considered
cricket to do Ragefire if you don't have the other pieces done.

    No, you apparently need to be part of a group of complete jerks to get
rewarded. EQ is about teamwork!
