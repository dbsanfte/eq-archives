They are very relevant.  A news group is a free flow of expression (or
whatever...) from all it's contributors.  REAL people in the REAL world
contribute to usenet.  I don't know what fantasy world you live in...but
usenet IS the real world.  Thus, a person's educational background is every
bit relevant, (just like it would be if all of us were face to face instead
of behind our computer screens.)  The fact you (probably) lack any
significant educational acheivement is likely the reason you find education
so irrelevant.

First of all, showing a few examples extracted from the last two weeks that
biz is capable of writing posts which aren't pesimistic flames did not put
me in my place.  Do I threaten you that much you need some assurance you
have a victory?

And second, you're just becoming annoying now.  For the last few days, I had
fun toying with you, in the same sence I can hold a dog bone one foot above
a dog's head and watch it continually jump up and down, over and over in
hopes it'll grab it.  Lokari, you have this characteristic, in which you
just HAVE to have the last word.  I know it, and I've been using it.  I can
really give a flying fuck what you think about ANYTHING I write, but it's so
fun watching you jump up and down trying to grab that bone.  All I have to
do is post a response to you, (no matter how stupid a response it may be...)
and I'm guarenteed to watch you jump again.

And it's getting annoying now.  I'm thorwing you the bone.  You've
succesfuly proven that bizbee isn't a COMPLETE and total asshole...just 85%
of one.  Wow.  Congrats.  But that's it.  That's all you've done up to this
point.  For god's sake, if I'm that threatening to you, then killfile me.

This newsgroup has been your life for the last two-and-a-half years.  I quit
the game over a year ago, and consequently this newgroup.  But I come back
to read what people are saying about SoL and Windows XP, and here you STILL
are -- flailing your usual self-righteous and ignorant attitude.  Don't you
think it's time you moved on?  Maybe do something with your life?
