    No, Dennis, it does not. Adding mana to casters does not improve
***efficiency*** - the long-term XP/sec a character can pull in. It does do
so for a melee.

    This is irrelevant, unless your argument is that casters are already
better in XP groups than melees. The damage caps also come off at a pretty
low level, right around the time when people really start grouping for XP.
You also don't address how better weapons decrease down time for melees, and
how increased mana pools don't decrease down time for casters. It's quite
simple:

    Mob X has X HPs, and deals Y damage per second. Melee Joe the twink
comes along. He deals more damage per second than other melees, so he kills
Mob X faster than an untwinked melee, so he takes less damage and needs less
time to regain the HPs - the main cause of his downtime. He also may have
better AC, which also reduces damage taken (and downtime), and some form of
regen which directly reduces downtime. Caster Bob the twink comes along. He
still needs to cast the same number of spells to kill Mob X as if he didn't
have a bigger mana pool. He thus requires the same mana regen time as an
untwinked caster - the main cause of his downtime. There aren't any items at
his level that make his spells do more damage, or cost less mana, or make
him regen mana faster, so he is stuck.

    Wizards have known about this for a while, and are excluded from the
standard pickup XP groups because of it. They cannot get the sustained DPS
that a melee is capable of by just nuking a single mob at a time, and the
way mobs are neutralized when multiples are pulled (mez) excludes the use of
AoE tactics.

    If it isn't soft-capped at the level of armour a melee of that level
could get from standard adventuring, his point still stands.

    Whether a caster is hit or not is irrelevant. They spend their time on
their asses getting back mana - that's the factor for determining downtime,
not HPs.

    They're far more plentiful than mana regen items, now aren't they? Farm
TT for a day, get an Iksar Ceremonial BP. Farm Fungi King for a week (used
to be a day), get a Fungi Tunic. Tell me what you could farm to get your
twink a single point of Flowing Thought?

    Did it. Nada. Everything my necro could solo comfortably before, she
could still solo (with less margin for error). Thus supporting the assertion
that MANA for a caster is like HP for a melee.
