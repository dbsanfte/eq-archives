Well this is the crux of the problem, we were a small clan to begin with 
so only three of us were playing EverQuest 2. We would only need three 
more people to set it up, though, and we do have someone who had an 
interest in our clan also thinking of playing EQ2 (another long-time RPG 
fan) so I'm sure we will eventually get there.

Thanks for the heads up, we've encountered these problems before 
elsewhere in the gaming world with other clans, so we already have a 
fairly strict heirarchy in place which conveniently mimics the EQ2 Guild 
heirarchy, and we only have one leader to avoid the issues you mentioned.
