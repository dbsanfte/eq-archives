Resist gear does not replace your normal gear, its a second set
of junk you carry around for those rare occaisions when it matters.
Drop 100 wis for resists for normal encounters, and you might as
well be walking around naked.  On the other hand, facing one of
the many boss mobs with a dispelling AE, and you don't care
about that 100 wis, since without the resists your wis might as
well be 10, you are going to die faster than you can spend your
mana anyway.

Resist Gear to look for; player made jewelry; this covers face, neck,
ears, fingers, forearms; relatively inexpensive nowdays, since the
bazaar has crushed any hint of rarity.  This stuff is lightweight and
all/all.

Also, there are Mage summons that cover shoulder and range slot
that are a large resist boost for most people, there should be a mage
providing these at any appropriate raid.

This aside, you can pick up some dirt cheap resist gear for most any
single save, once you get over the fact that it sucks for any other
purpose; you can also look around for no drop gear that works
the same way.

As a druid, you have it easy; fill up your bank with resist gear
and just pop over to misty to pick it up as needed.  As a monk,
you have it very rough... my cleric casually carries around a
couple backpacks of junk gear, you really really don't want
to do that, but don't have easy access to a bank.  Still, get one
of the porters on the raid to take you to bank first, the phrase
"I need to get my resist gear" should be sufficient.

Of course all this is predicated on resists mattering.  They didn't
before, and I've not been on enough raids since the patch to see
if they do now.

OH, you know what matters more than resists?  An insta-click buff
item.  The worst mobs are the dispelling ones; dispell Aegoism
and its like you took 1Khp in damage, for instance.  Get an insta
buff, and keep it up constantly in the number one buff slot, and the
dispell won't get your buffs.  The reason they are asking you to
have 100+ unbuffed is because they expect your resist buffs to
be dispelled.... get a spyglass, tie it to your right turn arrow, and
you shouldn't lose much at all!
