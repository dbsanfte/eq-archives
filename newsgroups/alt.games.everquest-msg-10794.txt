It's based solely on level.  Once you get higher, the /con messages
will start to change as well.  For example, at 27 a yellow con to me
now read "Looks like it would wipe the floor with you!" instead of
"...quite a gamble..."  But remember that con messages are not totally
accurate.  Some will overcon (the "vengeful" skellies in Everfrost)
and some are horribly underconned (griffawns).  It doesn't take class
into account either, and since soon you'll be a "133t dr00d" kiting
mobs all over the place, you'll be able to kill yellows and the
occasional red solo sometimes.  Look forward to this ;)

>If so, at what level do orc centurions change?

I have no idea, it's been so long...but another thing to remember is,
most generic mobs have a level range.  An orc centurion could be lvl
8-10, or whatever lvl they really are.

Here are the /con messages up through your early teen levels:

        Character Levels 1 - 6 

-4 and below Green - looks like a reasonably safe opponent
-1 to -3 Blue - looks like you would have the upper hand
even Black/White - looks like an even fight
+1 and +2 Yellow - looks like quite a gamble
+3 and up Red - what would you like your tombstone to say? 

        Character Levels 7 - 12 

-4 and below Green - looks like a reasonably safe opponent
-1 to -3 Blue - looks kind of risky, but you might win
even Black/White - looks kind of risky..you might win
+1 and +2 Yellow - looks like quite a gamble
+3 and up Red - what would you like your tombstone to say? 

        Character Levels 13 - 14 

-6 and below Green - looks like a reasonably safe opponent
-4 and -5 Blue - looks like you would have the upper hand
-1 to -3 Blue - looks kind of risky, but you might win
even Black/White - looks kind of risky..you might win
+1 and +2 Yellow - looks like quite a gamble
+3 and up Red - what would you like your tombstone to say?
