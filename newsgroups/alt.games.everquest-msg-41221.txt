My barbarian warrior, level 48 with an agility of 98, regularly out
runs the level 45 halfling with 102 agility that SoW's him, at least
when using autofollow.  My level 37 barbarian shaman can outrun the
druid on autofollow.  Both barbarians can even keep up when encumbered
& the druid isn't.  Agility does seem to matter, at least where
autofollow is concerned.
