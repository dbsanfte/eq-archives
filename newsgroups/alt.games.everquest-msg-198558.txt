I see there is another mage reading the magicians tower boards :).
Anyway, you forgot bard's wind of marr song which adds another 20 or so. Not
sure about extra songfocus items and aa's of bards.

Anyway to the original poster, the only cap there is is on Flowing Thought
items. They all stack with each other, but you can't have more then 15
Flowing Thought in total. This counts for all item mana reg effects in total
as long as they're innate and not (clickable) buffs (like the emp robe).
