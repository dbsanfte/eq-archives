That was my first, too :))

High-level Necromancers do - it lets you breathe underwater and see
Invisible creatures as well as doing Levitate.

Shadows of Luclin would be handy, but see if you can get one of the
various compilation packs.

I have buttons made to say things like "thanks" for just that
eventuality, heh.  Check out the manual on how to do this - as you
say, it takes time to type, whereas clicking a "Thanks" button takes a
second :)

Killer-betties.com (a site for female gamers) quoted a survey that
said 39% of MMORPG gamers were female now - whether actually true or
not, I couldn't say.  It's usually best to not say you are a female
player, when in-game, as some sad types who never get to meet a woman
in real life tend to hang around your character a lot, after you tell
them   ;)
