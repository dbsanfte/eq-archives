    Even if you didn't get something (and the stuff was pretty good), it was
fun running around killing some of the oddball stuff that was wandering
around. It was also great fun listening to everyone call out locs on stuff
they couldn't use. Hearing "item X is rotting, someone come loot it" is
something I haven't heard in a long time.
