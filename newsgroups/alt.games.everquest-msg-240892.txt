Not a factor.  The instant you go into trader mode, you stop consuming 
food and drink.  Too many baking and brewing vendors ate themselves out of 
business. :)  As a side note, lacking food and drink will never, ever kill 
you directly.  I've sat around hungry and thirsty in camps for days on end 
with no ill effect.  The downside is, being thirsty stops your natural 
standing mana regen, and being hungry stops your HP regen.  You'll still 
get mana from clarity and HP from chloro, and a tiny dribble of each from 
sitting, though.
