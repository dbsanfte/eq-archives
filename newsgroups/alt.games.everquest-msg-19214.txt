One of my cleric friends is 'guild rezzer' - from time to time someone
else will be running his character around for rez purposes (Yes, I
think he's a dumbass for going along with it, not only for security
reasons but also because it's annoying seeing a friend online only to
find it's someone else)
A couple nights ago I saw his cleric online, sent a 'hi', got no
response. Sent another tell asking if it was him or someone else and
got back  'hi am a res bitch. i am busy. they are more important than
you. no res for joo'.
I chewed his (the rez bitch, not my friend) ass off for being rude and
for forgetting that even a cleric might have friends...
