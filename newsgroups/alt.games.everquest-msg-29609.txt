Well I have to admit that I wasn't a pirate with the TRS-80 we had.  This 
was the model I, one of the first that one could purchase and take home 
(I'm not sure if it came before or after the Apple I, but there must have 
been more of them).  We didn't know anybody else with a computer, so who 
could I pirate from?  It would have been too hard anyway, the cassette 
tapes kept inserting graphics into the program lists of the original 
copies.  I remember there being a game that we bought that I wanted to 
play, but we couldn't run it because it required 4k of RAM.
