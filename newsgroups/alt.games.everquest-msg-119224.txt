There are no serverside logs of kills and such at all, that is why the
/report command is in the game so if anything does happend a log can be
recorded and sent to the server for investigation by the GM's.
This was confirmed by the server head GM in a recent killsteal issue on my
server where a guild came in and
killed and allready engaged Ragefire and stole the kill and the cleric epic
piece from the guild who engaged him first.
The whole matter was resolved in favour of the guild who engaged second
because there was simply no proof in form of /report-ed
log to confirm that there was an actual killsteal.
