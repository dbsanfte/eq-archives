Y'know, what amazes me about this is that they are trying to give the BEST
technical aspects to those with the BEST machines--and leaving the people with
average machines or lesser behind.  I think if they polled the players, a lot
more would say they'd rather have better content, richer encounters, stronger
quests, fewer bugs, and faster loading time than for the topmost 5% of EQ gamers
to have "smoother animations."

Yes, they do have to evolve, and that's expected, but they're going too fast in
this one direction.  EQ ain't about the animations.  That's just icing.
