Plenty of times. Logged back on, got corpse.

Couple times. But our cable modem service is really good about that stuff. Just
lucky I guess. I've never seen it down more than an hour when I wanted to play.
Again, logged back on and got it.

Don't recall that happening, no.

Nope.  And I drink plenty while playing, trust me. I may often do STUPID crap
and dies a lot more, but I alwasy seem to remember to get my corpse and camp
before fully passing out. ;-)

Fortunately, no.  Most times when I have a RL obligation, I know about it well
enough in advance to camp, or just not play, when I have to be someplace else at
a particular time.
