I was online until the very moment our staff had to take it off the net.
Wintersroar was all that EQ couldn't be.

Well maintained, nostalgy, great staff, lots of fascination with
the game, fewer morons than on the most civilized EQ live
server.

I guess Sony just got scared seeing the increase in population
there lately, which was mainly their own fault for the fuckup
with raising the subscription fee.

Just a sidenote: Wintersroar has not a single byte of Sony
software on the server side. And on the client side, we all
had our paid-for copies of all the expansions we were playing.

I will never EVER purchase anything that Sony earns a single
penny on if there is any way around it.

Just because Sony is too stupid and greedy to make a good
game, they ruin the work of those that made it lots better.

/mourn Wintersroar (maybe we can find a way though)
