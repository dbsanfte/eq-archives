Ok here's my story...bout 3 years ago the guy I regularly grouped with 
had to quit EQ for personal reasons so he gave me everything...his 
account and passwords ( only owned up to Kunark at time ). Knowing this 
was against the EULA I didn't do much with the account til Velious came 
out. Then I re-activated it and since then have paid for it and bought 
every expansion for it ( and my main account too ).

What I wanted to take 2 characters from this account given to me and put 
them on another account and also take 2 characters from my main account 
and put them on another account ( so I would now have 4 accounts ) but 
because I was "given" this account and have no way to produce the 
original keys I can't do anything with it.

So what I am probably going to do is buy a new evolutions CD, transfer 
the guys from my original account to the new one and just let the old 
one go....yes out of spite, even though I knew I never "legally"( in 
sony's eyes ) owned the account.... and basically sony will now loose 1 
account, plus I will only be opening up one account instead of 2 and 
won't buying the CD's and future expansions for them.

It seems that because I can prove ( through billing ) that I have owned 
this account for a long time and bought the expansions from velious up 
they should just allow me to do what I want with it, the only thing they 
lose is me having bought the original and Kunark CD's yet they stand to 
loose more in the long run ( like transfer fees, etc. )

I guess my rant is why do they still make this such an issue, it seems 
kinda old in it's thinking. Anyways just a rant...was curious how others 
felt bout it
