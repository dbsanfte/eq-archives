Several ways to get there, depending on your level, class, availability of
friends/strangers to buff you.

1.  What he said.

2.  Jump off the raft when it zones into TD, swim to the ship, and either
the front or back of the ship is a spot you can climb up onto, and ride the
ship to FV.  You won't be able to climb up into the ship, you will be on the
bow or stern, but it does work.

3.  Jump off the raft, swim to aroun n12200,4200, you will see wizard spires
sticking up out of the water, swim to the bottom, down the hole between the
spires, drop to the floor, might hurt, levitate and sow would be good.
Click on the pot for Cabilis, zone out to LoIO, run.  Invis is good for
this.

4. Take the raft from Oasis to Ogre Island in TD.  Take the ship from Ogre
Island to The Overthere.  Hop off the ship after it zones into OT, swim to
shore.  Zone into Warsliks Woods, run to LoIO zone.
