I did that once.  I had bound on the dock in East Freeport, waiting for the
boat.  One of the particularly annoying "dOoD" beggars came up and began
annoying everyone.  I ran back to the bank, got out 15 pp and turned it
into copper.  Hit myself with my Ring of Flight, and Gated back.  Then I
told the beggar I'd give him 15 pp to go away (he was, of course, still
there.)  I'd misjudged how strong he was though, because the last I saw he
was slowing inching back towards the bank.  And sending me nasty tells
every foot of the way.  Just before I /ignored him, I told him to feel free
to toss the coins.  After all, it's only copper.
