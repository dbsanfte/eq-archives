Get into it.  Please.  I've seen many a SK solo well into their 40's,
and my ranger is currently mowing through 39 pretty damned easily, and
I'm not even doing the snare and scare route right now either.
Beating on dwarves in EW for Kael faction.  Got through two full
bubbles of exp last night and I only had one that beat on me enough
that I felt I had to back off and plink him to death.

Not trying to start and argument, just curious.
