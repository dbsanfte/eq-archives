During the Halloween GM event in East Karana (Druzzil Ro server) I picked up
a rather ordinary looking magic item called a Dried Grass Tunic. No stated
bonuses, procs, or restrictions. Looks just like any other low-level armor.
I've since searched the equipment pages from time to time, but seen no
mention of it. Anyone know what it's for? Anyone else seen one?
