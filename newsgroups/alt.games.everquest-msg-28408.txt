Jewelry is generally the most lucrative, but it requires a very large
initial investment and is generally only viable for enchanters.

Blacksmithing tends to make money also, though not as much as jewelry,
primarily in banded and fine plate armor, and if you can, cultural.

Fletching can be profitable once you get the skill up high enough to make
darkwood bows.

Tailoring, once you get it into the upper reaches of skill can be
*extremely* lucrative with some of the ultra-high-end Velious stuff, but the
time investment to that point is ridiculously high, cultural tailoring can
also have a selling point.

Tinkering, for gnomes out there, is mostly entertainment value until you can
make rebreathers/aqualungs, which are in demand as enduring breath items,
and rebreathers for the Warrior epic.

Baking, with the recent filet nerf is no longer viable for any real sort of
moneymaking, except possibly if you are catering a wedding, but that isn't a
reliable source of income, ditto for brewing.

Alchemy is profitable, but its shaman only and takes *forever* to get to the
higher skills because it is level capped.
As a rogue you should do poison making at every chance, but for personal
consumption, not public trading.

For guides to tradeskills: www.eqtraders.com ; and for tailoring
specifically, www.lokari.net
There are better poison guides out there than eqtraders, but I don't
remember the address, and its a link off of eqtraders.
