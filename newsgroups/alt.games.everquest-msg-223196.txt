Not the actual CD, no.  Once the key that came with the CD has been used 
to create an account, the key cannot be used again to create a new 
account, a new key must be aquired.  The CD itself can be used by anyone 
to install EQ on their system, and, if they have a valid key, or account, 
then, they can use the software.

In general, SoE does not sell keys.  They have been known to provide a 
key, if you purchase software from a store, and can prove it, and the key 
shows as having been used.  They also had, and may still have, a free 
download of just the original EQ with a key to activate it, but, that 
would not give you access to anything but the original world.
