I'll leave this for someone else to comment on as I've never played a
ranger.

In addition to the guild leader, there are likely a few others in the guild
that if you right click on them like you would a vendor, it will bring up a
skill training screen.  Pretty simple.

If you have tried this and in reality no one wants to talk to you, as it
sounds like from your earlier post that you missed passing in your note at
the start of your char's life to your guild leader, this might have
something to do with it.   But post back to see if this is indeed the case
before goign down this rat hole.
