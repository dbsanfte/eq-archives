There's a flaw in your logic to all this: You aren't being taught by
being sent out into the field. You're being taught in the cities by
the trainers/guildmasters/whatever. A level 1 character has been
through "boot camp", and is now being sent out in the world into areas
where the threat is lower to cut their teeth. The veterans' efforts
are better spent facing the foes that pose bigger threats in the world
than running alongside a bunch of green soldiers. A green soldier
isn't going to learn much by watching a veteran cleave an orc in half
in one swing, and the veteran can't really tell him anything he didn't
learn in "boot camp".

It's clearly implied that the point in your character's life where you
pick up and start playing is where he has learned all he can in
training yards and needs actual applied experience to learn more. The
trainers can still teach them the advanced techniques when the
character is ready, but they're past the point of needing someone
standing over their shoulder and showing them how to swing their
sword, aim their bow, etc.
