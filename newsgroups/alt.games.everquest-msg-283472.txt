Let's put that in perspective...a perspective that you might understand
since you want to inject US politics in to the issue.

Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Ted Kennedy used their embezzled
oil-for-food funds as well as left-over cash earned by Bill Clinton's
illegal arms sales to China to finance a secret counterintelligence
program designed to conceal the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden.
Knowing that his capture would lead to improved poll numbers for Bush
and all Republicans, the Democrats have been actively shielding Bin
Laden for 5 years.

Proof?  You want proof of this?  It's right there on google!  Do you
have proof that I am making this shit up as I go?  No?  Then STFU if
you can't prove your case.
