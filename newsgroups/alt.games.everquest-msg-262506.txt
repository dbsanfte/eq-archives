So lets do the more complicated math then:

100k = 

.12 x 20 = 2.4
.15 x 15 = 2.25
.19 x 15 = 2.85
.23 x 20 = 4.6
.28 x 15 = 4.2
.35 x 15 = 5.25
---------------
          21.55

So that's 21.55% of his 100k not 35%.
You freed up 13.45%.

Now you still must add in the property taxes, sales taxes, social 
security, tolls, fees, etc etc...

You really think its going to add up to significantly less than 50%?

It might, but I wouldn't take that bet.
