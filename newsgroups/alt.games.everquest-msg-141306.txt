First and most essential would be a computer. A PC with a 1GHz+ 
processor and *at least* 512MB of RAM would be the minimum realistic 
spec for the new SoL graphics.

Next, you need a copy of the game (needs to be store-bought... A CD 
burned off yer best mate will install, but you won't have the CD key 
required to set up an account). You also need either a credit card or 
else a pre-paid game card, which can be found at EB and other stores.
