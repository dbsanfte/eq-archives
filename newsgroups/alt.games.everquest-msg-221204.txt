There is a strange quirk in game mechanics, as has been explained to me. 
The knight classes are *designed* to be better able to generate aggro. 
When a nasty mob comes into camp, there is a need for a class to be able 
to lock it down onto them. That's where the knights come in. They 
generate insane amounts of hate in a brief period of time to accomplish 
this. However, they are not meant to be able to take the kind of damage 
that a pure warrior can. At that point the warrior then has the ability 
to taunt the mob off the knight and onto themself, the MA, where it 
should be.

This sounds like a recipe for success, but as it turns out, the knight 
classes *can* take enough of a beating in most situations to double as 
the MA. I think the problem is the fact that the knights' damage 
mitigation/avoidance is too close to that of the warrior. 

People are likely gonna scream at me here, but I think the warrior class 
should be head and shoulders above all other classes where pure toe-to-
toe melee is concerned. That would mean that, though a knight could steal 
aggro, no one in the group would want them to once the MA had it, because 
they would be too large a burden on the healers compared to the warrior. 

Nerf the knights or improve the warriors. I'm not sure which I would 
prefer, but it seems that the former would be the option that would avoid 
making a huge number of encounters trivial.
