Ahh sorry but thanks for the good giggle, makes a wonderful mental image,
reminds me of the time I shrunk my barbarian shaman and ran around akkanon
exploring. Since I was in a goofy mood i decided to camp in a cozy room
above the bank...logged in next day and could get out, (silly me didn't even
think about the fact i was shrunk and the stairs had a very low ceiling over
them) couldn't stand up to cast shrink on myself or gate..what a bugger it
was, ended up getting a druid in the guild to come teleport me out lol.
Thanks for the chuckle and dredging up a pathetic memory of mine hehe.
