Here I agree with you whole heartedly; EULAs really are a poor
substitute for a proper contract, and also underscorre the problem with
trying to controll a product as tightly as many corporations have
become accustomed to.

A very excellent game. Too bad we seem to be headed in that direction
;)

At this point, I will concede the argument about reverse engineering
and packet sniffing.  You've made a good argument, and I realize that
was not a valid venue for arguing the illegitemacy to EQemu and it's
developers and operators. This point, however, I will continue to
argue:

Except the content IS mirrored on the server side to some extent, and
does constitute an unlicensed reproduction and use of the copyrighted
content.

It is still being transmittted and reproduced by a public third party.

I, too, used to believe that being a fansite released me of various
copyright limitations.  Hasbro's lawyers have informed me, and many
other Transformer fans and their associated fansites, otherwise.  Wile
they allow us to continue to operate, it was made clear to all that we
were to operate within certain guidlines.

I don't know if Hasbro still actively goes after new fan sites, or
maintains active communication with said fan sites (my own has been
down for some time now), but the lesson is that being a fan site does
not grant you right to use said material in any fasion, nor any form of
immunity.

Well then accept my apologies :) I'm used o dealing with folk who have
not herd of these properties.

Granted, but the EQemu sites ARE reproducing copyrighted material in
the form of server-side in-game content and much of the server-side
interactions. While the code itself may be legal, much of the content
may still be in copyright violation.
