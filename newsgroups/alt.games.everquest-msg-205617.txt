He knows more about it than me, as he actually researches things ahead of 
time.  If he doesn't know, I ask others that have fought the mob in 
question before.  If they are uncertain, I try to slow, preferably giving 
the MA enough time to establish agro, if that is an option.  For the 
bigger mobs we attempt, they generally do know ahead of time.
