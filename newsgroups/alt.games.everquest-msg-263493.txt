I think Velious was, to some extent, the place where they got things 
right: you could get ports to various places, but first you had to get 
there under your own power once (to pick up a insta spawn item off the 
ground in each port location).

This made travel an adventure, and yet once you'd -done- that adventure, 
made getting together with your friends to go do something relatively easy.

I wouldn't have much quarrel with the current EQ model for 
transportation, IF they had that same mechanism in place; put a "tooth" 
or whatever next to each of the POK books, and the POK stones don't take 
you to the books until you've picked up the corresponding tooth.  Since 
we have the key ring, the teeth won't occupy any inventory space.

Likewise, I think all druid ports and all wizard ports should require 
similar keying; they can't even mem the spells without the keys,  and if 
they try and port or TL you to a spot you aren't keyed for, you don't go.

Instead of adding this in, or even allowing the old ports to stand and 
just requiring it for the new stuff like Nexus Stones and POK books and 
so forth, they actually killed the tooth mechanism even for Velious.
