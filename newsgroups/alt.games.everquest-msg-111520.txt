Is there anything beyond market that's used much?  I tried /join lfg and
it said password wrong, which seems odd, but oh well...

I put some points into human, but I can just barely make things out. 
How much does learing a language typically cost on this server, and
where is a good place to hook up to learn them?  FYI my enchanter on

I think I'm going to leave it DN after reading up and listening in on
some conversations, so not going to worry about it now.

Is it possible to get into paniel proper?  I can't seem to find the
entrance, I'd like to get soul bound before I go getting myself killed,
