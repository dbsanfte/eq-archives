Some people believe the atk rating, like AC is comprised of 2 numbers, to
hit and to dam, eg. some warrior has 1 in 2HB he'll miss a lot, and raising
strength won't make him hit more often.  Weapon skill improves the chance
of hitting for normal damage, and strength only affects the max damage.

In another word, 5 point of skill gives more damage than 15 points of 
strength, even though they get you the same attack rating.

I do significant more damage with Avatar than without, much more noticable
than a mere 100 point strength buff, and I believe that is due to the 
plus raw attack component of the spell.

Of course this is all speculation and cannot be proven or disproven.
