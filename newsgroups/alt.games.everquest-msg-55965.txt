LOL...you think thats bad? Try being a necro and using Lich and the cleric is
constantly casting celestial healing on you every time you go down a bubble
in health.....even though youve explained that it is Lich that is causing the
health loss and her mana would be better spent on the tanks because you are
about to cast a 338 point lifetap on the mob.......AND the cleric gets mad cause
they HAVE to keep casting heal....no wait....insist you stop using Lich and just
use clarity like everyone else.....hey that solves it.
