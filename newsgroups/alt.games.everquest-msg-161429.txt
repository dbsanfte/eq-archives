I've pre-ordered Neocron, which is coming out Tuesday (12th), and is
absolutely amazing...

I recommend people try the limited offline tutorial/demo.  It doesn't
scratch the games content, but offers a look inside the world, and is very
cool.. Play it through, you won't regret it...

Neocron had some issues in beta, especially the control scheme, but they've
all been resolved, 100%, and the game is flat out cool as games can get.
There are so many strong elements in this game that it is pretty obvious
they took what was good out of every game that has come before it, and
dropped it into their own world.  With the recent patches, we've seen combat
vehicles and troop transports added, which are amazing..  Basically, you can
pile 3 of your pals into a combat vehicle, and Halo style, go off and have a
blast in a massive world.

Neocron has over 250+ Zones, and is very large. The cities are exceptionally
big and immersive.  The blade-runner feel of the cities and world is
extremely cool.  There are no levels in Neocron, its completely skill based.
Neocron is a FPS-MMORPG, there are no passive "Evade" type skills, and the
combat focuses on YOUR SKILL as a player. If you want to dodge, you don't
have any built in dodge crap, you need to learn to move, and fight, like it
should be...

I highly recommend you download the offline-demo, and play it through (at
least past the hacking part), and get a feel for the game.  Knowing that the
demo is very limited, and is only meant to show you how the controls work,
and basic aspects of the world. http://www.neocron.com for more information.

Neocron is scoring 85-100%+ on every single review to date, and many major
mmorpg sources are listing it as "The best mmorpg ever to come our way"...
If you browse the neocron official forums, you will *NOT* see the typical
"THIS GAME SUCKS" posts every second, like the ones you find in DAOC or AC2
forums..  The overall opinion of ALL of the players and beta testers, is
that this is a fantastic game.  The overall opinion of anyone thats review
it, is that this is an exceptional game.  Do a search to find the reviews,
here is a sample:

(note they reviewed during beta4, before many enhancements)

Neocron has full housing (well implemented), player rides, speeder bikes,
combat vehicles, implants, player owned installations and vendors and
more.... Players can test their skills in holographic rooms where they can
setup Unreal Tournament style deathmatch maps, and test out the changes to
their character, or new weapons (without actually really killing anyone for
real)...  Its all here folks..

Realism is intense, with drugs, serial killers, hookers, strip clubs, sex
clubs and just about anything you can imagine in a real future city.

I've read the manual to the game, and i'm completely blown away by what the
game offers...  Neocron by far, offers all the elements I want in a game so
far...  It seems to borrow heavily, the best aspects of Meridian59 and
Ultima Online, as well as a few key things from Anarchy Online, DAOC and
EQ....

Here are some highlights pulled from the game manual.. =)

* Emote-chat..  In a normal game, you say hi, and nothing happens.. In
Neocron, you say hi, and your character waves... This works with most all
chat commands...

* Extensive player chat/talk!  Zonewide, area, clan, personal, etc.

* Gamewide communication - from your house, you can access ingame email,
message boards, job listings, and game news!!!!  Forums for people to post
on, and read from the comfort of their own home.. Now THAT builds strong
community. (M59 had this and the boards were great)

* Teleporters in your housing - When you die, you can resurrect to the
station in your house, but not only that, you can use them to teleport
around the game world, to other peoples houses (that you have authorization
to??)...  So in other words, Scott could say "Meet at my place at 10pm EST
for Clan hunt", and at around 10pm, everyone would teleport into Scotts
house from their own houses..  *Amazing!*

* Computer terminal in your house -- where you can do everything from look
at city maps, learn about tradeskills, read about laws, learn about
monsters, read the guides, learn about clans(guilds), read the guild
information and players, even apply for membership to the guild!!!!  Also,
from these terminals, you can  see the status of the wars,check job
postings, enter and keep track of other players, track your kills and
information on yourself, and more!!! *HUGE*

* Outfitter .. IE Replicator - each house has an outfitter in it, when used,
can change your character, cloths, etc... *nice*

* Halo-Deck (IE Arena) - where you can setup training, matches and duels in
a arena type place, with various layouts!  Kinda like deathmatch levels in
Unreal Tournament or something. -- anything that happens in these halo-decks
have NO effect on your character outside of them.  *wow*

*Clan Installations/Outposts - Clans can own these, run shops in them, set
prices for every type of thing, and rent stuff out in them!  Guilds get
together, and buy these outposts, but i'm sure they can be conquered by
warring clans... *great!*

* Strong guild(clan) conflict, cooperation, and wars.

* Strong Faction Content, wars, struggles for terrain and resources (clans
and factions can even control parts of cities!) (what DAOC shoulda been)

* Excellent PvP action, with BALANCE.. Some big fights can last for 4-6
hours.. (Meridian59 style)

and much much more.... This will be the best game out.. I'm betting on it..
