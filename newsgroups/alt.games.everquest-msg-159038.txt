The buffs are nice, but forget the PR equipment. Put on your hp
equipment, it will help more.

Most guilds I remember don't bother with a MA with Trak. Holding aggro
just isn't important enough. His melee is so inconsequential compared
to his AE. The clerics have way too much else to worry about than one
tank.

For a guild that can't manaburn or put trak down before he can AE,
they have to keep their clerics healing their groups, not a MA.
