     Thanks for the feedback, everyone.  I guess I was in sort of a bad mood
when I wrote the starting post, having just gotten off the FV  community
boards.  

   I does make sense to me that clerics could generate some bad PR for
themselves.  We have desirable, expensive to cast buffs, which is guaranteed to
caused fiction at some point.  We can perform a valuable service, Rezzing, that
is not easily duplicated to the same extent.  And we play a class that can be
botted fair successfully with relative ease, making it seem to the casual
observer that our job must not be very hard at all.  The fact that we are so
often sought out for groups must also be a sore spot for other that might spend
time with the LFG tag on.  
   I might also be getting just a tiny bit burnt out on my job.  Teapray is my
first real main, and it feels odd for me not to be jumping between a half a
dozen different characters as the whim strikes.  I think I'll just dust Lentea
off a bit and see if that help improve my mood regarding how clerics are seen on
FV.
