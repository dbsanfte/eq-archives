    So what did the Scryer drop? 8) That's one of the spells my cleric
always cast stuns against, as even with everyone's MR well over 100 somebody
would go for a ride and potentially end up some god-awful place.

    Trains? Are you sure you were in KC? /snicker

    People zoning into a big train? Are you sure you were in KC? /snicker

    I would ALMOST say that KC is the last place that you'll ever have to
deal with someone else's train, but watching people train the castle in
Velk's has given me new appreciation for the word "moron". Well, except for
the guy who got Velk himself to zone last week - that was a piece of pure
genius.
