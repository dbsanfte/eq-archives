|Equipment:  Warrior is using some sword and a wurmslayer

	When you see your tank using a Wurmslayer, RUN.  SAVE YOURSELF.

	Wurmslayers hit like a ton of bricks (at least back when they were
introduced; they're less impressive with mudflation but they were a key cause
of it anyway), but they can't hold agro for beans.

	And low-level knights can't taunt off a dual-wielder.

	Mind you, unless you're wearing prom queen gear at level 40 you probably
make as good a tank as the Warrior anyway.
