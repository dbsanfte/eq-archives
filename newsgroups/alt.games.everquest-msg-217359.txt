As someone else mentioned this is probably stealth changes to the mobs
in question to make them match the quality of loot dropped.  Kylong
Darkmail really is some of the nicest middle of the road droppable

I'm assuming that each mob has various values for his ATK, max hit,
special abilities etc and they can tweak this easily serverside.
