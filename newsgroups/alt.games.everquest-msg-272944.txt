Well, lets see. You and several other people have claimed no one can
or has been jailed in a democacy unless a law was broken. Historical
fact proves your claims to be false.

I said they were stupid to ban him if he made a valid complaint and
whom ever did it should spend some time in jail. Sort of a cool off
time.

I never said they hadn't the right to ban him.
