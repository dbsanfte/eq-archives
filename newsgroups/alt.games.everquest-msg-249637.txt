Ok, the reason I ask is I'm trying to choose a tank for my 3-box.  I've got a 
Frog Shaman and a Frog Wizard and want a 3rd frog character so it's either a 
Warrior or Paladin.  I know either can tank fine but of course I'd like 
whichever I choose to be the better DPS one.  Someone did say the Warrior is 
better DPS, but is it enough to outweigh the aggro-control/healing/rezzes of 
the Paladin?
