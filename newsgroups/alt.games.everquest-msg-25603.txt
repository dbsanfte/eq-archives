My guild camped Ragefire for several clerics in a row recently.  On the
second cleric's turn, started when the servers came up from a patch, we took
out Nagafen, kept FGs clear, and the servers came down for an emergency
patch.  Then we took out Nagafen, kept FGs clear, and the zone crashed. 
Then we took out Nagafen, kept FGs clear, and Rodcet Nife, specifically, was
brought down for maintenance.  Then we took out Nagafen, kept FGs clear, and
the zone crashed.  Then we took out Nagafen, kept FGs clear, and _finally_
got Ragefire.  In all nearly a week's worth of time spent trying to get
Ragefire with someone in the lair or clearing it 24/7.

Oh yeah, then we took out Nagafen after the next patch to do the next
cleric's Ragefire camp, cleared FGs, and the zone crashed.  Took out
Nagafen, cleared FGs, and the servers were brought down for an emergency
patch.  Not quite as bad, but still ridiculous.

(Getting hard to take Nagafen, thank goodness for twinks)
