the hell can't I equip my instruments. I am now a level 8 bard. I've read
tons of stuff on how tomplay the class. When I try to put my drum or
mandolin in the secondary slot, it won't drop it in there. I do have the
skill perc. and stringed. The only thing I can figure is that I already
hotkeyed the abilities I had when I started. I can't seem to change those
hotkeys to use those skills. Anyway, thanks again for all the help. A bat
wing crunchie to all.
