Sort of, but then I guess you could say all gear is "temporary" until you
get a better drop. : )

It upgraded one of my two weakest slots...  Chetari Bonecraft shield was
what I had used since level 20 or so, 19 ac and no hp or stamina.

Very doubtful.   I began the quest, but after about 40 hours of faction
farming off and on, and still not making it out of "scowls ready to
attack"...  I don't think I'll ever finish it.

I don't sell items.   If the friend who made it for me is back playing the
game again, I'll return it to her once I get an upgrade.  If not, I'll
probably give it to a friend who can use it, if I can find one.

I don't do the tunnel rat thing.  Never have.   As a consequence, I've never
had more than 10k in platinum, and seldom that much.  So I don't shop the
bazaar a lot.  I'll have to look into that cloak, and see if its anywhere
near my price range.
