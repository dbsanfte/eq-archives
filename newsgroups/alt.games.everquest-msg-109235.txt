Heh do you mean "Lure" spells? Lures.

"Lure of Frost"
"Lure of Flame"
"Lure of Lightning"
"Lure of Ice"

They're unresistable except against mobs who have invulnerability to
that element. These are what make wizards so useful in ubermob
encounters, when everyone else is resisted like crazy.

A bunch of other spells have really good resistance rates (like
druid's Winged Death, for one example), they're often described as
near-lure like, and a few other spells are virtually unresistable but
not really called lures (Harmony, Tash for two, especially before
luclin). But only wizard, as far as I know, gets real, true lures.

If this isn't what you meant, well.... sorry. :-)
