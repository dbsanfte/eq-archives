A couple of weeks ago I was working on my focus items for my mage
and I would start near the point where there are two elementals
'guarding' a portal where a DE mage and her pet would be standing,
go down to the room with the tent in the middle of the room and
another 2 DEs were, then back around and go down to the jail level
and kill the mages there (also the skellies.) Also killing everything
in between. Over the course of a couple of hours a day for 3 or 4
days, I got 3 focus items and three pages. Kill everything is my
advice. I can't recall clearly, but at least two of those 6 items
dropped off of something other than a mage. Could be it was two
of the focus items, or one of each or two pages, I can't really
remember.
