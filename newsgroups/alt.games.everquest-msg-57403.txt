This is true, I dont deny that.  But you see  you are participating in a
game where power is measured by wealth and ability to kill.  The other
primary factor is reputation.  And regardless of fairness in execution, a
guild war is an opportunity for an organized group to go head to head with
another organized group in a battle of wit and stratagem.  Reputation of
the guils that outpplays the opponent generally goes up.  The losing guidl
doesnt really drop.  It just sort of floats at the level of mediocrity it
was before.  In the case of two guilds goin to war and both sides playing
well, both guilds have increased reputation.
    Of course,  thats with my way of thinking.  Its not so outlandish in a
fantasy world to say "sometimes" that might and power go hand in hand.  Oh
yeah did I mentin I like power.  TY
