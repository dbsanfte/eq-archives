Fair enough. Ten is probably an exaggeration. But if money is your big
concern, shop around.

Take a look there. 36 bucks. And that took me *exactly* (yes, I was
timing it) fifty seconds to find. Only checking ONE site. I bet it could
be significantly lower with more searching.

If you can't afford 36 dollars to upgrade your system from a
non-supported operating system that the *MANUFACTURER* (i.e. Microcrap)
has given up on, (Note: this is *not* VI giving up on it) then you
probably shouldn't be spending ten bucks a month on EQ not to mention
the cost of the upgrade.
