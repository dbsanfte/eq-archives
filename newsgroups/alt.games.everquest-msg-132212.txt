There are still only 5 spells per page in the book.  It may have referred to
the number of spells that can be memmed.

A lot of new focus effect items were added recently and they work
automatically when the right type of spell is cast.  For example an item
that gives mana conservation of 10% will automatically work everytime you
cast a spell.  These items do not stack.  There is a complete list of all
the effects somewhere, but I followed a link listed here and don't know
where it was.  Probably Casters Realm.

Most people get to Velious with gates, and if you have Luclin you can take
the nexus there.  You get to Luclin via one of six Wizard spires that take
you to the nexus.
