Yeah, you're going to learn a lot of things the hard way in this game.
Example, how to avoid killing yourself while descending a sharp
decline.

You only need MR if you're up against casters that will nuke you. Just
keep that in mind when you go up against one of them. If you know they
are going to target you, increase those resistances. At that level, I
doubt you're going to run into many that can cause a significant
amount of damage from spells (cleric mobs can nuke you with
magic-based spells).
