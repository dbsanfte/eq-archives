I'm sure there are guides out there, but I'll go with the basics.

Level 1-15 you're going to pretty much suck because all classes suck and
enchanters are hard to play right.  Your main difficulty will be trying to
remember to mez adds, tied with trying to convince your group mates not to
BREAK the freaking mez.  Besides Mez, root, and (believe it or not) melee,
you won't have much to contribute beyond what any class can contribute.  I
think you get your first Slow spell at 12, but it doesn't do a whole lot
except eat mana.

At level 16 you have the possibility of AE mez (always watch for pages 26
left & right - looks like half pages) which can help a lot, plus of course
Breeze and Haste.  At level 16 people have to start listening to you.  At
level 16 enchanters get SoW (/ooc trading Breeze for SoW at windmill!).  You
can start telling people that they'd BETTER start using assist and they'd
BETTER stop breaking your mezzes.

From then on the tough part is keeping your eyes open ready for adds,
keeping folks hasted and claritied, keeping critters slowed (if no shaman)
and watching for adds (yup, said it twice).

A question I've heard from every new enchanter is this:  "There's 2
critters, how do I know which one to mezz???"  My answer: "Just mez one and
hope for the best."  There's statistically a 50% chance you'll be right and
be seen as pretty danged smart.  If you've mezzed the wrong one, no biggy,
now you know which one to mez. :)

"ARGH there's 3 there and I can't target the freaking extras!"  Two options:
AE mez (less preferred by me) or hit F9 and look at them from above.  It
makes it a lot easier once you get used to the disorientation at first.

By far the biggest piece of advice is one forgotten most of the time:
RELAX, IT'S ONLY A GAME.  You have one critter being worked on, 2 mezzed,
and you get 2 more adds headed straight for you.  RELAX, don't freak out!
If you can't get a mez off, root the puppy and back up.  You'll have a
better chance of getting a mezz off on the 2nd...if not, root & back up then
take your time.  Err, depending on level.  Chain casting level 4 & 20 AE
stun may be faster than rooting...my root casts in 1.8 seconds, mez in 2.5.
I swore by AE chain stunning from level 20-54, I don't stun much anymore.

It doesn't take a lot of mana to keep 4 critters mezzed...10-20% mana max,
assuming you have time to sit down for a few seconds occasionally.  With 4
adds it's generally hoped that you're grouped with a main tank who will
listen to you about which critter to fight next.  Lord knows you don't want
them to break the one you just got mezzed at 5% mana, KNOWING that there's
one about to break in less than 10 seconds on its own.
