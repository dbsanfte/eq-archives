:

I play on TZ, and I can tell you that 100MR will be suficiant to about 30,
and 150MR till about 40.  As A PC you will never resist 100% time, no mater
how high your resists are.  AS long as you have high enough resists for the
levels you are going after, and enough to resist one cercle of spells higher
than your level, you should be fine.   When I was 22 I finaly broke down and
got a set of gear that gave me 120+/- MR  snare/root almost never took hold,
and when it did it was blinking when it landed.  When I hit 30 I noticed
that most PK'rs had learned to take advantage of the MR over all and would
use there Disease/Poison/cold/Fire magic against me.  At this point I
desided to get a rounded out REsist package that I where when I am just
moving from place to place.
I now have SELF BUFFED:
Magic: 149 up to 188 with 4 items switced
Fire: 128
Cold: 170
Poison: 124
Disease: 132

With this I can resist most necromancer/drood/shaman dots.  Against
Enchaters/mage/wizards I loos the disease/Poison and rase my MR to 188.

AS for the teams. About 80% of the guilds on TZ  X-team.  and about 25 % 4
team.  There are verry few pure non dark guilds.  Now it seems as if it is
DARKS against all others.

Hope to see you on.  If you are a lighty i will test your Resists for you.
=)
