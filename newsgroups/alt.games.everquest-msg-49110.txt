I've noticed a few minor bugs that are in Kunark, not sure on Velious as
I've not been there yet. But I'm wondering will they be in Luclin too?

1. ___ scowls at you ready to attack -- what would you like your tombstone
to say?
I can sit right on top of it and not be attacked. This is mainly (so far
from what I've seen, never played past LV12 in Kunark so not sure about
other areas) leaches, man eating plants, scorpions, and I think few others.
In the other world areas if they scowl at you ready to attack, then getting
near them they'll attack you unless they're MANY LVs lower, and sometimes
(skeletons) that doesn't even stop them.

2. I'll give you _ gold _ silver _ copper for the ___.
Then when you try to sell it to him he says "I'll give you absolutely
nothing for the ___."  I've not seen this in the old world, and usually
those merchants will start off saying they won't give you anything for that
item. The Kunark ones will for some items, but many they'll claim to buy
then not. The only time I've seen non Kunark merchants do this they'll only
offer 1 copper for it.

Also just a minor thing here, but the "Swamp of No Hope" shows its name. No
hope of leveling in any decent amount of time. The few mobs that exist there
all act as if they are rare spawns, and are as spread out as most of the
ones in WK.
