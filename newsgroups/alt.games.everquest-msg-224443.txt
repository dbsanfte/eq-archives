Call me a fool, but I can't think of any reason a wizard would care if a 
mob was slowed.  You can't slow mobs yourself, you don't cast a resist 
debuff which might help the slower, you surely aren't planning on 
letting the mob smack you around some just because its going to do so a 
bit slower.

I initially suspected you'd confused slowed with snared, which certainly 
-is- a wizard's business, but that would be something you can tell when 
not in hand to hand with a mob, and not something that you could 
possibly figure out if you -were- melee'ing the mob.

So help me out there, why does a wizard care about slow?
