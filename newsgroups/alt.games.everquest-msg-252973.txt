I often like to keep two snares up: Engulfing and Dooming.  I use
Dooming to kite but Engulfing is there if the mob gets away from me. 
It casts much faster than the rest.  (I'm level 59).  ED also gives me
a quick and cheap way to get agro up if I need.  As for dots, Splurt
and the Boiling Blood line are my favorites.  Disease dots are highly
resisted by most mobs it seems and poison isn't much better.
