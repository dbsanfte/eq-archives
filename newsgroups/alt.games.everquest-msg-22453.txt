Re-read what he said.
It's not ok regardless of what the mob is, the distinction is because
it's a low level mob that is on a 20 min spawn timer, most guides/GMs
(who incidenately are probably busy with other petitions) won't bother
wasting their time over it.

Do that on a major mob whose drops are very unique and VERY rare
across servers, and you bet the GMs will get involved.
