Grrr... I use this:

http://halime.imdat.de/

Not unsurprisingly, it shows my own posts as properly threaded, but I'm 
a prolific enough poster that I can see that, if what you see is common 
to most windows newsreaders, it could be a pain in the arse for 
everybody. I'm very happy with this newsreader, but I'd look into 
something else rather than disrupt the newsgroup. Pity they don't make 
XNews for the Mac, I really like that one.

Maybe you could, just the once, open the NG in Outlook Express and see 
if perhaps it's a Netscape-specific issue?
