Open up the Audio Triggers window, and in the pattern box put
something like "tells you" (minus the quotes of course) and pick the
sound you want.  Test it, then click Create.  Done.

I have gone a step further and have audio speech telling me info when
certain things happen, simply done by adding more wavs to the
selection.  If my Slow spell lands on a mob, the trigger says "Target
slowed" which means I can focus more attention on the fight and less
on the chatbox.  I have speech triggers saying things like "Fizzle",
"Invisibility fading", "Target weakened" and so on and so forth.  You
can make wavs of audible speech free, in a variety of voices (I use a
couple of different voices) at:
http://public.research.att.com/~ttsweb/tts/demo.php
All you do is type in what you want, see how it sounds, then save your
nifty wav file.

I also have EQ Watcher - EQ Watcher.com - running, which can be set to
audibly read out Tells, Group Chat or whatever.  Handy for if I am
windowed out of EQ for a moment, or in the heat of combat.
