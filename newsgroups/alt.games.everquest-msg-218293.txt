my druid hunting/tradeskilling partner have a deal we do a '20 pack' 
.... we sell enough components for 20 tries at wyvernhide armor... while 
he kites the wyverns around me, i do the alchemical combine for 
celestial to get ready to brew coldain velium tempers...when i have the 
tempers done, i move down to the beach and fish until i have about 30 
cod, to make 20 cod oils with...and while there i brew up the coldain 
heaters to combine with the celestials to make the tempers...and then we 
wander over to cc for the velium drops to make the studs with... we sell 
it for 15k and generally have a short list of tradeskillers that 
regularly buy from us. All told, about 4 or 5 days of work. frequently 
we end up with about 5k from the wyvern drops gemwise. IIRC, the other 
crap i fish up pretty much pays for the cost of the bait.  After all is 
said and done, with less than 500 plat for water, brewing supplies and 
bait, we make out like bandits. I ust wish the ehides dropped faster...

Other times, i will make a 10 stack pack of coldain tempers and spend 
many days fishing to make cod oils to sell off my trade mule. 
Unvariably, the tempers will sell out in 3 or 4 days, and the 10 stack 
bag of cod oil will sell out in a day. Tempers sell for 25 to 30 plat 
each, and oil sells for 35-50 depending on our mood and if there are 
others selling in bazaar...all just depends on what i am doing at the 
time and how badly i want to make money
