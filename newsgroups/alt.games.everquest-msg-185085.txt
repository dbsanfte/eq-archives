Goblins in BB are good loot at that level. You can go the green ones
near the chessboard en masse, you get 3pp per vial of blood dropped by
them from vendors. Aqua gobbies are good loot too. 
Paludal is OK loot, great exp. 

Go to a high level zone with no banks nearby. Announce that you will
change copper/silver/gold for PP at a 20% fee. bring lots of plat (or as
much as you have, to start.) 
Make this run to many zones and you will come out quite well off.
trak's teeth is good for this, and as long as you are there, ask to loot
a hangman's noose. Lore/nodrop all/all head/waist haste item. They rot
quite often, and it is a nice headpiece for a soloing druid.... I picked
mine up at 14 on a VERY hairy run. (leave your stuff at the bank if you
do this, you do NOT want a corpse run in that zone)
