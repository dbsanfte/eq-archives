I'd want to explain to people what was going on, preferably in
character, but in clear terms.  Further, I'd set things up so that
the 10% who want to break things don't get to ruin it for everyone
else.

This means that mobs that aren't there to be killed, are invulnerable,
and you get clear messages to that effect, similar to what happens if
you try to hit a will-o-wisp with a non magical weapon.

This means that spammers and general /ooc jerks get some kind of
reverse ignore, GM's should have a /mute command that cuts them
out of /ooc /shout /say, and /emote channels temporarily (say for the
duration and only while in the zone.

Futher, people in gross violation of the spirit should be dungeonized.
I've seen this suggested as a "ought to be an option" in threads like
this, but it already exists, as about a year ago (shortly before the
opening of the Hole) a guildmate of mine had this done to him in
Qeynos.  He was in his own private zone, a small boxlike area,
and only /tell and /guild to communicate with the outside world with,
until the event was over.

Rewards, if any, should be based on the challenge of the event,
not arbitrarily uber; one thing I liked about the Oasis debacle I
saw was that the items were decent ones you'd probably have
to be in your 30s to acquire, but neither unique or "planar"
quality.  Since the event seemed to be aimed at the teens
hunting in the place, these should have been pretty good
rewards, nice but not overwhelmingly so.
