Good advice, I certainly won't refuse to shop in the bazaar, but if there is
a RP quest I can do to acquire better weapons and armor then I would rather
do it that way. Questing for cash isn't really my idea of RP'ing, but Lief
does have a good point also. You should copyright that phrase : ) ,  Lief.
The money trees are in Butcherblock Mountains, Green Goblins like to run
into them and get stuck, about 1 in 8 drops 8 plat worth of loot, blood,
head and sometimes weapon : ) Does anyone have a use for a vial of green
goblin blood? I have 12 of them and the bazaar seems a good place to flog
them. I haven't seen a use for it on any EQ sites yet. Another way to do it
would be to collect the smithing materials myself then ask a kind soul to
put them together for me. When I think of the bazaar the first thing that
comes to mind is the people who buy plat on Ebay, then buy weapons and
armor. If it came to that, then I would just buy someone's lvl 50 account
and skip all the questing. Yikes, kind of spoils the fun. Anyway, I'm
heading to the bazaar today to see what's available. Thanks for the tip on
velium weapons Jennai, I'm still learning.

I've already started doing so, even if I won't be able to put things
together for another 30 levels or so. I seem to be foraging one no-drop lore
item a day, guessing that they are Ripened Greater Heartfruit because
there's no indication of what I'm picking up, the message only says that I
have found a no-drop lore item and I can only have one in my possession. The
only foraged item I have that fits this description is the Heartfruit.

Does anyone have any advice on making a newbie bow? I've searched and read
but any tips for a newbie from experienced bowers (?) would be appreciated.

Thank you everyone for your helpful comments and advice. I really appreciate
the time you spend answering and clarifying.
Good hunting.
