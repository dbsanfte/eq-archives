Jazz is right. Some content in this game is designed for the "uber
minded" person who play way too much.  Verant appreciates their
business so they create content for them. If EQ was designed for the
casual player, these folks would have moved on long ago. 

Not to mention if you spend much time with these folks (ubers), you'll
discover the high end but not uber players to be a much nicer and
fairer group to play with. I was a fly on the wall for two uber events
and the drive and greed that motivates these folks to pull down these
high end MoBs is kinda sickening, the bickering and whining..... It's
all about the "bling bling" for them. We have two 60s in our guild who
were so sick of the greed they quit their uber guild and joined or
high end guild even though we at best can do Kael arena.

Better yet, read an uber guild web page or two. Recently the link
which was posted here for I believe Legacy of Steel spoke volumes
about the mind set.
