There are no general/archetype aa's that compare to 
level.  

Let's try a skewed version of the twin paradox :)

You and your twin are level 55 mages (for instance).
You decide to stop and AA at 55, he decides to keep
leveling.

You have to first dump 6 points into general - with
each point costing as much as leveling 51-52.  The
very best of the general abilities, run3, will not
really allow you to level faster.  

Meanwhile, your twin is exping the exact same number
of hours and has gotten to about level 58.  You run
faster without SoW on, but he has Transon's Phantasmal
Protection (+6 mana per tick), GVoC earth (not the
best pet, but it hits harder and is 5 levels higher
than the Voc. pets a 55 mage is using) and Shock of Steel,
which does higher burst damage at a better ratio than
Char, which is what the 55 mage uses.

Next you gun for SCM3 (flat 10% mana reduction on all
spells) - the single best Archetype skill for mages.
This requires 12 more points.  

At this point you are still fighting in PoI, PoN,
PoJ and fighting mobs that are generally under level 55.

Your twin is now fighting PoN Gobbies or Dock, or maybe
even PoV FC.  The ZEM is the same, but he's fighting mobs
over level 55, and therefore gets a High Con Bonus -
a bonus that ranges from 1.93 times the xp and up depending
on mob level.  (must be at least level 55 and no more than 
5 levels lower than you).  So, in the same amount of time
he is now making about 1.5 - 2 times the xp you are.

By the time you get SCM3, your twin is likely level 61.
He's using Ward of Xegony (2 to 3 times the DPS of 
Voc Water - 54 mage pet) and has Firebolt of Tallon and
Shock of Firey Blades - they have the same ratio as
your Char (52 nuke) with SCM3 applied to it, but hit way harder.

By the time you get a couple more AA (SCF1) he is now
in BoT with a 96% hasted 62 water pet that does 80+DPS
to PoP mobs.  Get to SCF2 and he's likely level 65
and has Black Steel.  By the time you get 6 more aa's
and get SCF3 he has 12+ aa's himself and is getting
one every 1.5 hours in a really average group.  Every
one of his kills is worth 2.5 to 3 times as much XP as
one of yours.

Level - then AA in almost all cases.  Basically the only
AA's my kitty had before level 65 were from get PoP zone
flags.
