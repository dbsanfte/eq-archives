No. Not tradeskills.

If you want to have the most tradeskills possible to you, play a gnome 
rogue. Then you can do poisonmaking and tinkering, as well as baking, 
tailoring, fishing, jewelrymaking, pottery, and smithing.

The nice thing about being a high level necro is that the stuff needed 
for tradeskills is easily farmed. Many tailoring guides for instance 
start with the old jok, "take your level 60 necro and farm..."

Of course, now we can be level 65, and yes, it's quite relaxing to farm.
