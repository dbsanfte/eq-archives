I rarely get Sebilis groups (I prefer Velks). On two occasions, I have
been in there with a cleric. In one group, all gems were randomed. In
the other group, the cleric took all gems till she was happy, then the
rest were randomed.
Dan is ticked off because this cleric apparently thinks he too good to
pay attention to guild stuff and is a stinking rich loot whore to
boot. If clerics could be dr00ds, this guy would be it. 
Would any of you have liked it if some snotface with cash coming out
his nose abused the 'clerics need compensation for peridots' gem rules
to get even richer to your own detriment?
