I would go higher...it's on topic, got regulars arguing with each other.
Moral and Ethics debate.
I'd have gone for an 8/10.

BUT...His post falls down due to believability.

12k of items dropped in the busiest zone in EQ, EVER (I've not even seen a
GM event come close...460 last night on BB reports that it was over 500 on
the first 2 nights) that takes some stupidity when you consider there is a
zone like Shadow Haven just next door...oh a zone full of buildings and
huts..many empty. OK so he himself admits to doing it but I wouldn't suggest
that there would be 2 people that "smart" on 3000 player server.

12k of items that he would then have to sell to be able to buy what he wants
(and he does state he bought these "toys") so he managed to sell all in one
evening...against 300 odd traders (out of the 460 in Bazaar on Bristlebane
320 were traders) to get the money. He also knew all the prices of such
items (ok PC's from the zone could help here, but 2/3rds or more are AFK
anyway)

This knocks the score down to a more average 5/10...This is still a good
score and made for some nice arguments...would have been better if he hadn't
revisited the thread.

Hey,  did I ever tell about the time a PK'r mid 30's bard was killed in
seconds but a 50th PK'r Warrior friend? Well friend of a friend...No it
really happened, honest.
