Hopefully, the same day that the Rez Stone, Fo7 stone, KEI stone, SD stone
and the rest get added...why just make a stone for Druid's beneficial
spells...do it for all.  After all...why should you need to group with other
players?  Just go to PoK where you can click whatever you need...
/sarcasm off

In all seriousness...this really does just get under my skin.  I'm not
trying to start a "leave druids alone" flame war...I play every class but a
Shaman, Berserker, or Wizard (wizard starting up prob tonight), and it just
seems that the Druid class takes a lot of hits.  I know that in the old
days, Druids were overpowered, and certain people gave the class a bad
name...when will the bashing end?  It was a fun class to play, but stuff
like this (PoK in general) that negates one of a class's more prominant
spell lines is just uncalled for.  Seriously, don't you think Enchanters
would be upset if there was a clickie KEI Stone or Tash Gauntlets?  Clerics
upset if a Clickie 96% Rez Stone or a Temperance Tower?  Necros/SKs if there
was a clickie Summon Corpse stone....list goes on.

Flame if you will, I just ignore those...Intelligent rebuttals however, are
appreciated.
