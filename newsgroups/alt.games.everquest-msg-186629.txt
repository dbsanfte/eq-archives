There's not much point - you don't strike me as the helpful sort.

I hope you are.  You seem to have less than no clue about how to relate to
people.  It might be worth your while considering just WHY I've become
'grating and bitter' in the space of a few posts from you, when before that
I was quite happy taking the piss out of myself for being crap at EQ.

Your personality is pompous and self-satisfied.  And while I wouldn't
presume to speak for everyone as you seem to feel happy to do, *I* certainly
don't like to be around people like *that*.  I certainly feel for your
professional subjects if you're as clumsy with them as you've been here.

Well, that's a two-way argument, isn't it?  What's to say you weren't just
hoping I'd be too ashamed to post again for fear of proving you right, which
would incidentally ensure the last word went to you?  Then again, this post
might just be that proof.  Either way, it's not something I'd worry about.
But I'll leave it to you.  Take the last word if you want it - this
conversation has long outlived its usefulness, and I've finished with you.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
