This is in response to the patch message of the nerfing of Thunder of
Karana - Lvl 49 Paladin spell, 6 sec spell silence and 18 sec recast time,
costing 75 mana.  Now it is 100 mana drain costing 75 mana with a 18sec
recast time.  It has gone from making Paladins finally a useful class on
raids, to being a spell that isn't even worth memming.

Was it originally too powerful?  Maybe, but remember when casters were
owning mobs after they reduced the MR on them?  What did Verant do?  Nerf
the spells?  No, just flagged the mobs so they couldn't be touched be such
and such.  Or to even get around this spell affecting AoEs (which being a
SILENCE you would think that is exactly what it is for - roars, even if it
didn't work on any other spell or proc), they could have just made it so the
spell set the target to 0 mana for 6 seconds.  But no, they nerf it into a
spell that it nearly more useless than reckless strength has been since
debuffs were made to override buffs.  There was a million other things that
could've been done better than this.  I really hope this is just a temporary
fix.

Info from the Paladins of Norrath board showed that it was resisted on
average 50% of the time.  And there were also quite a few mobs that always
resisted.  Furthermore someone said they cast this on a mob and the mob
still Chealed.  The Paladin class gets something to make them wanted and
every other class immediately screams "Nerf 'em!"  I mean, why don't we nerf
warrior's defensive?  Why don't we nerf Cheal?  Why don't we nerf double
backstab?  Then maybe some other classes would know what it is like.  One
raid where a Paladin cast this spell it was said, "We need more Paladins!".
Do you know how long Paladins have been waiting to hear that?  Basically
since Kunark came out.

Verant knew full well the effects of silence - only had to look at how it
affects PCs when NPCs cast it.  Furthermore I am willing to bet it only made
things really easy for the Uberguilds.  But this spell gave the superguilds
that don't have gamers that are willing to drop whatever they are doing at a
moments notice to come and kill ubermob_01 a chance to beat some of these
higher mobs.

You can put a longer recast on it, you can make some mobs resist it all the
time, you can make it cost more mana, you can make it only affect spells
that use mana - but for crying out loud Verant what you have done is an
absolute cop-out, and a typical expression of how you treat Paladins, how
you fail to test things properly, and how you fail to address issues
properly.

The Paladin community is in uproar over this, and I hope it can put enough
pressure on Verant to get it fixed properly, because knowing them if we
don't do anything about it they are just going to leave it the way it is -
worthless.

OK, enough of my ranting.
