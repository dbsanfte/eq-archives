Ah, but you see, he is under the impression that he can't play if he is
bound somewhere far away.  I have had a number of adventures doing my CRs.
Longest one so far was Halas to Kithikor I think.  Only one of the three
characters I play regularly can bind, the others, ask, and almost always
receive a bind where needed.  I know I always bind people that need it if I
am nearby.  But then, I make these things called friends, and generally, at
least one of them can bind.  Not to mention, port, rez, and other handy
customer support.
