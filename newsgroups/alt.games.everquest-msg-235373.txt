That's because the DS counts as environmental or unattributed
damage.  The lowbie has to do >50% of the *attributed* damage to
get the xp.  Many ways of doing this:

Use DS's so the attributed damage necessary to kill a mob is very
low.

Use pets and /pet get lost or reclaim just before the mob dies
(which makes all damage the pet did unattributed)

Take the mob near death and charm it (clears attribution) and have
lowbie finish it.

Take the mob near death and FD (I believe clears the damage) and
have lowbie finish it.

Take mob near death and Atone/Memblur

Take mob near death and Zone
