That's an amazing story and I don't disagree with you.  However, I
consider that ability to be a serious exploit.  Did they fix that?

What if it was a PBAoE group?  Would you make the same argument?  In
regards to PoD I was thinking of the Flies camp.  For future
reference, there are other areas in PoD where a soloer could single
pull quite easily.

Ok, I can buy that.  Though I must say in four years I have come
across too many people who would deliberately pluck mobs from a camp
that was not theirs.  I'm serious.  I think I have maybe come across
three or four people in four years who have deliberately plucked mobs
from someone else's camp.  Granted, I was and still am a casual gamer
by EQ standards.  When I say EQ standards I have heard statistics over
the years that say the average player plays 3 hours every night.  I
probably play 9-12 hours a week on average.

I have been in this kind of a situation where someone with uber
equipment comes to a zone and can easily solo mobs.  The times that
this has happened to me I have simply moved on to other hunting
grounds.  I think too many people get in this mindset that "mr. uber
is hogging all the mobs from *my* hunting spot."  To that I would say
"Norrath is a large world, young man.  Go explore it."  When I could
not hunt in Crushbone, I would go to Befallen.  When I could not go
there I'd hunt various animals in the commonlands.  If that sucked I'd
work on a tradeskill.

Given your example, I can see and agree with your point on how
twinking can impact someone else's game.  That being said, I still
think people who think it's such an issue need to learn to move on to
other hunting areas.  Perhaps after going though the grind (if you
want to call it that) of the early levels with only banded armor and a
fine steel sword before there was a nexus or PoP books has made me
numb to the power leveling/twinking complaints.
