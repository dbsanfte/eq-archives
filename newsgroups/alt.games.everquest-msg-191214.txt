I think the problem is that there *aren't* thousands daily telling
them about it. People whine on message boards and newsgroups about
such problems, others grumble, load back up, and keep playing without
bothering to say anything more than a comment to /gu, /ooc, or
whatever. I imagine very few people actually bother to complain *to
them* relatively.
