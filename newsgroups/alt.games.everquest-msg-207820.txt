Epics are not hard with 60+ characters doing it for you, considering they
are 46+ quests (realistically, 50+, with good groups).

Always kinds of grates when someone says 'I did my epic at xx level, with
only xx 60+'s 'helping'....they did it for you...if they was close to your
level, I would call it help, if they are that high, you are there for
nothing more than hand in, if the characters that are 'helping' can handle
the fights on there own (which it would seem is quite likely, with that
pair).

I suppose they are not really epics anymore, what with everybody getting
over the top help, and MQing them etc. Personally, I prefer challenge's to
walkovers, but each to their own =p
