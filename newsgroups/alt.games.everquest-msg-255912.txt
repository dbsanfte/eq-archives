PvE is quite simple - it depends on the class but after trying a mob
once, you will know exactly whether or not you will win and by how
much every fight after that. There's no player skill you can use, no
efficiency reward, its all based on level and your skillset.

Some people like that sort of predictability; I preferred games where
good play rewards with faster exp or more kills.

I should emphasize now that my experience with DAoC is before its
expansions, though - its likely some parts have changed/improved since
then.
