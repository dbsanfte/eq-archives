Unless that character is very high level themselves, shouldn't you
have an easy time picking a zone they can't get to, or at least not
easily? And if you're in a group, it should be very easy to get a GM
to come over when one person takes the camp of 6. Honestly, there's
probably not much SOE can or even wants to do - unless something
actually illegal is going on, and stalking by physical presence in a
virtual reality environment hardly qualifies. Your best bet is
probably to keep ignoring the guy, and act as if he's not even there.
Don't respond on shout or tell or any other channel (but keep /petion
ing). He will get bored eventually. Play games with the guy: log on,
sit down in a safe spot in front of a camp, and go do your arrons in
RL for a couple hours. Let him wait there. Do that a few times, he's
bound to loose interest eventually. Or, well, he'll probably try to
train you, but at least then you have something solid you can complain
about to the GMs.
