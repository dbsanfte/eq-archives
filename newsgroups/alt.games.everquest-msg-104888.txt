Please do not invole me and my guild in your sex life.  

Why does my guild have to be festering assholes because they do not
need a druid on a 12~18 member raid.  

And your uber Guild will stop the raid because they only have one
druid instead of two.  Ofcourse they will wait because they neeed the
other  druid to do ?? 

Please can I join your guild because I know your guild will leave
multiple spots open for druids when you have raids.
