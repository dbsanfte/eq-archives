What I'm enjoying is the raw size. Right now me and some friends are
starting to raid lower Guk - time for undead frogloks to die!. Previous to
this we had been poking around in Kael (giant city in Veilious).  We're
discussing a trip p to the moon to do some work up there and check out some
stuff.

With DAoC, the number of places you can reasonably go for xp are fairly
limited, and get worse as you level up. By the time you hit 50, you
generally have the epic zone, maybe 2 other zones and teh forntier where you
could reasonably find anything that would give you xp. Now, a lot of that
has to do with the game wanting to stress the PvP aspect. But if you're not
wanting to do PvP, you'll probably get bored quickly. Or at least grow
terribly familiar with the landscape you'll be hunting in.

With EQ (and I'll admit I'm still pretty greeen aroudn teh edges) there seem
to be more places to gain xp in the higher levels. And some of the raids I
hear about are truly large-scale. (Honestly, I'm surprised that no guild
leader has gone completely bonkers trying to organize those...)

What may occur is that you'll grow bored with the role you're playing - the
warrior goes in and hits. The casters nuke. The healers heal. That's what
they get confined to. And I can understand getting bored with that, but it's
generally the same across both games.
