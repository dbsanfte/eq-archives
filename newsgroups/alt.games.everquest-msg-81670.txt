Heh, get used to it. Youre still on the early stage. After 158 tailoring 
get hard. I have 179 myself, and at the moment i done around 60 combines 
  at 179, still no increase. And since the materials are a LOT harder to 
get after 158, increases are something to celebrace once a week if youre 
  really lucky.
