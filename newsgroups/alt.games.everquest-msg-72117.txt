Buddy of mine runs a Fear raid once, sometimes twice a month.  I've
gone every time.  Maybe 8 times.  The only thing I ever roll on is
Vermeculated.  We usually have 4, maybe 5 druids on the raid.  In all
the time I've won exactly ONE piece.  The fucking Gloves (6ac +13dex
+5int +7disease weight 5.5).  

After better than 20 or 30 drops though, I'm still not bitter.  Oh no.
Not me.






Bastards.
