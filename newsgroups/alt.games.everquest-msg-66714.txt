Right now it would run like unholy poo since they upped it to dx8. I
have a p2 400 and its not enough really but I can play okay. Its been
upgrade time for you for QUITE some time since its been upgrade time
for me for like a year. I also got 256 meg more ram so am at 384 meg
now with a tnt 16 meg agp card. I'd call my system now the bare bones
pretty much for EQ and I really need to get 256 more meg ram and a
geforce 2 64 meg card. later Ill get a 1.4 ghz athalon and Mboard and
throw all my other stuff on it.

yeah, you could have run regular EQ and maybe even kunark (but not
velious that well) before the luclin dx8 upgrade but now even people
with very good systems are hurting.
