Err, sorry, I'm not sure what "around the same price range is" for those
items, since I either vendor them or toss on a_twink_03 (kinda like most
<500pp items I end up with).

There's not a lot of "non graphic" head pieces with anywhere near decent
stats for rogues.  If you really want no graphic, an Othmir Fur Cap isn't
very good stat wise for a rogue (3 ac, 3 dex, 6 wis, 2 agi, 7 hp 4 sv cold
all/all), but cheap (no more than 200pp) and no graphic.  Crystalline Silk
cap is in the same category as othmir fur, no graphic, but crappy stats (4
ac, 2 sv magic, all/all), even cheaper than Othmir fur caps (5pp max, heh)

I don't remember what level you are, but if you're in your mid 20's you can
go to Marus Seru and kill Greyhoppers for hides (assuming they fixed the
Greyhopper hides not dropping) and work on your tailoring, and get some
halfway decent armor in the process.

Only tunic and pants take 2 greyhopper hides, the rest of the pieces take
one hide, no other components except an under 5 silver tailoring pattern.

Mask is 5 ac (0.5 wt), neck is 5 ac(0.5 wt), belt is 6 ac(0.8 wt), gloves
are 6 ac(0.5 wt), helmet is 6 ac (0.8 wt), boots are 6 ac and 2% safe fall
mod (1.0 wt), cape is 6 ac(1.0 wt), arms are 7 ac(1.0 wt), shoulders are 8
ac (0.2 wt, nice for monks), pants are 8 ac (1.5 wt), Tunic is 12 ac (2.0
wt).

Back when Luclin came out, I made a full suit to display while skilling my
tailoring up, I think most of it's still on my friend's monk, and I know I
just took a spare pair of boots off his rogue (ok, I gave his rogue some
ravenscale boots, but I'm taking them back next time I log on, thx bazaar)

All pieces of visible Greyhopper armor are very dark grey leather, no
surprises there.

I'll see what I can do about popping the greyhopper onto a DE and getting a
screenshot (Allakhazam doesn't have one), I know I have full visible
greyhopper on the (human) monk unless my friend vendored some of it.
