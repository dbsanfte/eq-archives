Makes sense to me.

If I have not got one now I would pay say 6k for it.
Now that I have one I would not sell it for 30K cause I don't know when
the next one will turn up for less than that in the bazaar.

Sure I could take the risk and sell for 30k and upgrade some other stuf
and keep waiting for another to show up for 6k, but is it worth the risk
?
