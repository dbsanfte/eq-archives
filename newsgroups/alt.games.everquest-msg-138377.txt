It would be a very slight waste.  You would probably not be screwing 
yourself later, though.  I've pretty much ended up with all my characters 
getting to high levels with all skills close to max and tons left over, 
so... unless you really want to learn an obscure language the quick and 
easy way, go for it. :)

Oh, if you're a rogue, you might want it for raising poisonmaking.
