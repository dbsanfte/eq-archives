The Druzzil-Ro message board as well as Rangers Glade both of which I have
never seen be prone to rants of any type were flooded with messages.  A good
half of the threads were full of higher level players 54+ saying that they
were done and had either cancelled their subscriptions or were going to be
doing so.   It was looking like a good many of our veteran players were
going to be gone.  I for one am glad that they reversed the patch.
