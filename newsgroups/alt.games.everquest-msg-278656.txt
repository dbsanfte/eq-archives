Keep something in mind.  If you look at all of the past Everquest 
expansions, spells have *never* been such a PITA to aquire as they were 
in GoD and OoW.

In Kunark they were all tradeable.  In Velious they were also largely 
tradeable although if I recall, Velious didn't stand out as being an 
expansion where we got piles of spells.
Luclin's spells were also tradeable with the exception of the Ancient 
spells which (rightly I believe) were nodrop.  PoP also had tradeable 
spells, but the runes were nodrop.

GoD and OoW just flat out suck.  GoD spells were an enormous PITA to 
aquire partly because the expansion itself was so horribly done.  OoW 
turned what should have been fun into a nonstop campfest.

One thing I am eternally grateful of in WoW is the end to camping.  I 
spent many a night in Riftseeker's trying for glowing runes.  The problem 
is that once your melee buddies get all the augs they need, it becomes 
tougher and tougher to drag them back to the zone.

Sitting on my ass at work is boring enough - I don't need to log in and 
virtually park my ass in one spot as well.
