Exactly. Crays are used to emulate storms, tornados and hurricanes
for example. An intel/amd PC simply cannot handle it. When I was
university in 1990, one of the graduate professors, and some of his
grad students, were working on emulating a hurricane on a pc. it was
so a homeowner or a small tv station could predict hurricane
landfall path. Didn't work. The PC didn't have the ability to handle
all of the ocean, air, and ocean bottom variables. A Cray can do
that sort of thing.
