TOFS is an indoor zone.  Doubt I can solo mobs in there that are
even con to me, much less yellows, not with any whiff of efficiency
anyway.

Nope, druids don't get IVU, although I could buy the bottle version.  What
I'm curious about is, how do you keep IVU up while fighting?  Casting
spells, meleeing, heck even just getting hit (yep, I dish out pretty good
damage
just being hit, actually) all break invis, and further invis isn't actually
invis, its a faction adjuster; if a mob with frenzy gets close to a mob that
you are on the hate list for, then its faction to you gets changed out of
indifferent even if you are invisible.
