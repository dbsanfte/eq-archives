The general consensus is that Monk/Shaman is the best combo in the
game 1-60

At levels 50-60 mobs hit hard and have tons of HPs. At this point you
need the ability to slow mobs if you want to fight effeciently. That
is where the Shaman really shines, and a Monk/Shaman duo is incredibly
powerful.

Other good combinations...

Monk/Druid: Great to level 50 (regen, damage shields, HP buffs,
ports). At 50-60 the Druid cannot keep up with the job of healing to
remain efficient.

Monk/Cleric: Cleric heals, buffs, nukes, root.

Monk/BeastLord: Not a proven duo, but on "paper" they should cut
through mobs like a hot knife through butter. A lack of crowd control,
root/snare, and priest level healing is the only downside. If pulls
can be controlled this combo would be hard to beat for sustained
damage per second.
