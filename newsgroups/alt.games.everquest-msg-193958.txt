I appeciate the help Bergh, on MT you are known for being helpful! 

I found you can't bind in CC, dang it! Not a problem though. I will
try the bind trick though. I had used Yonder in the TD, where I could
be porting into water, and then gate in rapid succession. Gets me away
and it seems some mobs delay before entering water to chase you.

I did have an ugly incident where I was ported about 3 feet from my
original point, thats where I fought mobs and tried to get them above
me!

I am going to practice on gnolls, and sarnaks for a bit, then go back.
I tried it on the Rygorr outside CC and had to run inside the CC with
a sliver of health.
