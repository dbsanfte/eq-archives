One thing a cleric must learn is to count, as in "mark time"

1 ... 2 ... 3.. CH ... 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... CH

The Complete Heal rotation is mandatory in upper level encounters where the
mob has a significant damage output.  Generally you get all the clerics in 1
group, with a bard doing the AE mana, with KEI and they Stand, cast, sit,
count, repeat.

Depending on the mob.  If the mob has a substantial damage output, and the
SA snags the agro, then before the clerics notice you got a dead SA.  The
cycle is for one warrior only, anybody that draws agro dies (unless the
druids / shaman can save them :)  )


Another point to add is distance from the mob.  Everybody but the MA should
be at max range, since priximity can lead to agro.
