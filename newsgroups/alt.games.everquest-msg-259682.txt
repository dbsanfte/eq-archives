The definitive test might we be the following - on each
connection launch a command prompt and issue the command:

C:\> ping -n 86400 groups.google.com >logfile.txt

That's a ping command that will run ping for exactly 24
hours and log the results to a text file.  If you could
arrange for them both to be running at the same time
then that would be ideal, but even running them sequentially
would have some value because the main thing you're really
looking for isn't the specific number for any given instant
but rather a feel for how much the numbers bounce up and
down.  For online gaming a steady stream that you can
count on will be the preferred service over one that
jerks and halts one minute and then races the next.

With both connections now installed you are in a position
to put this baby to rest.  Please post the results!
