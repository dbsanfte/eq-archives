Hmm, I don't know. They said that there won't be loot that equals PoT
loot even at its best, however, I'd wager that just refers to the
single item drops. Remember augmentation! I wouldn't be surprised if
the best, say, weapon with all it's augment slots filled with the best
augmentation gems that can go in it will be at least comparable to PoT
weapons...
