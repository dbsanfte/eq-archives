Gnomish Vanishing Device!!!

Very expensive, assuming your server even has a tinkerer skilled enough to
be making them, but extremely worth it, 15k on Tarew Marr, but we only have
one person skilled enough to even attempt them, and it does come with a
stack of class 5 mana batteries and a toolbox to recharge.

If on Tarew Marr, /who all Qiz will return one of the characters of our own
resident 242+ skill Tinkerer, Qizar, if he's on.  Some guy on Lanys (Pimm)
hit 250 last week, he had some sort of ninja whirlwind farming session to
have done that so fast though,  Him and Qizar were neck and neck up to that
point.
