I didn't play AO, but had friends who did, so saw what a disaster they had
at launch.  I didn't go near SWG, but read about their problems.  From what
I've seen of EQ2 so far, it certainly is *way* above those.  It certainly is
possible to have a smooth MMORPG launch (DAoC, for example), but for some
reason a lot of companies botch it.  (DAoC came close to botching in a big
way, though...Mythic managed to fund the development without borrowing any
money, which sounds great on paper, but meant they had not established a
credit rating, and when they went to lease servers from Dell, Dell said "no
way!".  What saved them was that they had managed their development budget
so well, they had enough money left over to just buy the servers outright
from Dell).
