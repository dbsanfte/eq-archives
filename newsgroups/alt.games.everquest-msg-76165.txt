BTW, if you didn't reboot after you got the first message, simply rebooting
your computer may solve your problem completely.

I'm not sure you mentioned how much space you have free on the C drive.
That's the one that XP looks at.

You want to make sure you have at least (now), 5GB free on your C.  Ok, you
can probably get away with 2GB but that's pushing it.

Empty your recycle bin.  Even though the files are "deleted," they aren't
truly deleted until you do this...they're taking up drive space even though
it may not APPEAR to.

Your physical RAM (256MB) isn't the problem though yes, you probably would
enjoy EQ much more if you put in at least another 256 and preferably another
512 in it.
