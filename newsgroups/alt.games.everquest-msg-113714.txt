Your attack went down because this is the first time you ever equipped that
skill weapon, you suck at it currently and will have to practice. you didn't
include your level, so I will put the chart for HTH dam/delay here: the 1-4
number is level, the 4/36 number is damage/delay for human and the next
number is delay for Iksar.Iksar are slightly slower than humans, but get
regen and ac bonus, so they still kick our butts :)
