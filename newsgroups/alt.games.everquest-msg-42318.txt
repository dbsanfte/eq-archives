As you level up, the relative con of things changes.  At very low
levels, Red means careful and Yellow means go for it, while
blue means waste of time.

High single digits and low teens, this changes to Red means
not unless you have an unusual edge, yellow is careful,
and its the even con and high blues that is bread and butter.

By the time you reach 20, though, even con is beyond
your (untwinked) reach and your main targets are low
blues... the "vision" is that by this point you are going
to be working grouped up with at least one other person...

Up into the thirties the con system gradually changes into
a "in a full group" system, and only the "solo" classes are
really capable of killing things solo with any efficiency.

On the other hand, if you are 18th level and still wearing
cloth, theres part of your problem.  Sure, you aren't
twinked...but thats not the same as not being able to
spend the time and effort to at least make your own
raw silk... or heck, at your level cured silk if not Wu's.
This isn't an expensive endeavor, just a time consuming
one, and one that wouldn't have been all that time consuming
if you'd worked on it since single digits.

Further, hand to hand, although a good skill to work on,
isn't really your best bet until somewhere in the high 50s.
You should consider investing in the best 1hb weapons
you can afford, and don't get complacent about them, but
rather keep saving up and trading up.

Also a solo monk has a massive problem... mass.  You
can't realistically loot like the other classes, which is
doubtless part of why you are so low on funds.  If you
partner up with someone, and have them loot everything
and split up with you at the end of each session, then
you won't suffer this problem.  Healers are helpful, but
from a pure money standpoint, -any- class but another
monk would take care of your worries.
