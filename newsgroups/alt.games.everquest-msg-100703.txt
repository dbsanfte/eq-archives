Hey Jazz -- nothing personal here, but allow me to
draw a similarity to another area in life...

The reason we pay so much for many things, taxes
included, is because the people running the "show"
slip these "tiny" increases by continually knowing
that people will go "Aww, come-on, man.  It's only
$3".  Before you know it, you're paying $3 extra
for every bill, and that's just the beginning.

That is how the politicians keep juicing your
income with taxes.  "We just want to raise sales
tax 1%..."  "We just want to raise property tax
1%..." and so on.  A couple years down the road,
you're paying several percent more, for nothing
extra in return, all because the increases were
viewed as "no big deal."  The sad thing is that
because "nobody complained in the past" they
feel compelled to conduct the increases EVERY
year because they know they can get away with it.

You have to draw the line somewhere.  I'm not
saying that I will quit EQ and I'm not even getting
super-angry over the increase, but I do realize
that things like this have a tendancy to "snowball"
and really give you a raping over time.
