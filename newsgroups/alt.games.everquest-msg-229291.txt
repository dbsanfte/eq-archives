Its a stunt spell.  There are cases where its handy, although I can't 
think of any where mem blur wouldn't be better... unless its a case 
where the chanter is Busy or you don't have one.

I did use it to "charm kite" as a cleric; I'd pull dire wolves down to 
the river in GD, get them fighting coldain tracking wolves, then when 
they started to run, root the coldain wolves, kill the fleeing drakkal 
wolves, then atone the coldain wolves (who were otherwise pissed at me 
for the root thing)

I think atone wipes some of a hate list; in a case like this where there 
was very little hate (just the root) it worked very well, it was also 
easy to check, since they conned Ally to me after a successful one, and 
KOS to me from the root if they weren't atoned.

If you melee something or nuke something to death, though, you can build 
up a good deal more hate than atone will wipe, thus the several casts thing.

As its expensive, slow, and has a long recast time, its a real pain to 
actually use unless you have a special plan for it.

Theres a staff that gives you the effect as a clicky... I used that even 
less than the spell, since it took even longer to cast!

Splendid
