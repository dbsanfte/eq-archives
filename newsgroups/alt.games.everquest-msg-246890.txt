Then the buck is passed back to SOE in such a case; in either way,
they have two available options at the moment; increase guide
capabilities, or increase the GMs. I haven't logged in for weeks
simply because it's the same old same old, but if they had GMs to not
only solve problems but have interactive content that evolves (not
just expansions), aka GM events that were real events and not just
"mob A has spawned, go kill it", I would.

I remember one time walking through Nektulos, and there were two GM
gnomes duking it out, challenging players (all while role playing,
making it even funner) to test their might.

Even basic interactivity like that makes the game that much more fun.
