Yeah, its lower numbers in general and some key people going to play
DAOC or other things. Many of the people from DAOC are now back in my
guild in EQ but then that can cause new problem.

I get real tired of the drama myself, it gets old. When it ceases to
be a bunch of people who go and kill some big mob because they want to
and instead turns into a "you have to come because we want to kill
this big mob and need you", its just no longer any fun. Luckily I'm a
Druid so I am not quite as in demand as say a cleric or enchanter who
is REALLY noticed.
