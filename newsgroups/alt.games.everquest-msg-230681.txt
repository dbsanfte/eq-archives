In general, you will tank better than the pet, think of him more as an 
extra DoT tossed on each and every mob.  The other benefit, is that if you 
leave him taunting, you can often step back from the mob, and have the mob 
turn on your pet while you cast something.  All that being said, I didn't 
start really using my pet until much higher levels, spent my time kiting at 
your level, then switched to root and rot.
