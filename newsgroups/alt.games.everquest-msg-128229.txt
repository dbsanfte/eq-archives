I got all my words for my Necro in LOIO, HighPass and SK.  Also found a lot
on vendors in OT and FV (with my Shaman).  I always troll vendors for words,
pages and runes for myself and my guildies.  We set up mules with excess
words just to make certain we always had them for the research classes.
Now, with the vendors in Katta selling the research spells for the "good"
casters, only Necros need to worry a lot about their spell research (not to
mention having a level 49 spell (Dead Men Floatin) drop off a 65 mob in
Ssraa).
