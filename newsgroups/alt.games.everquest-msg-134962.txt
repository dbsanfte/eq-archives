Actually, I do not think EC will become a ghost town, mostly due to people
not wanting to buy or wait to go to a slow ass zone.  What will make Bazaar
so busy is the fact people will have Mules, which I have seen, on a second
account sitting AFK over the night or on a second computer to free up their
main to do other things.  Also, I have seen that Auction channel is still
active, which suggests some people can even undercut the bazaar sellers by
actual haggling, which is how most people do in RL to sell their items.
Ecommons will still be there not just because of lowbie sellers, but also
for people who want to sell due to the nature of Bazaar being too laggy for
them or because they do not have Luclin to begin with.

Actually, you should see the Economy go to a slightly lower end now...
Reason:  Posted prices.  While at a fixed pricing, /bazaar allows buyers to
actually look for a good price.  By doing that, you and your competition
are now working as Capitalists...  What would be the best way to sell your
wares.  Now already, people who have a second account have and advantage
over you, they can continue to play, especially if they have a 2nd
computer, to sell their wares and continue to farm for their needs.  They
also can undercut what you consider fair market value due to the nature
that they are not in a hurry to sell things, forcing you to lower your
price a little if you need to unload it quick.  Bazaar, in and of itself is
the ultimate form of haggling, because you are now competing not with the
buyer, but with other sellers of items you are selling.  While you may not
be haggling with the buyer, you are haggling with the competition to sell
the very items you are trying to sell to other people.  For example...  My
bard who was in Bazaar last night looked at Singing Steel items...  3 of
the 4 people selling the same Singing Steel item were selling at 500pp...
the fourth person was selling his for 6k.  Guess who isn't going to sell
theirs right away?
