Hi everyone:

My level 65 Wizard is a Master of Research. In Bazaar this afternoon I found
words that make high-end spells for the Necromancer. I put these words into
my Sorcerer's Lexicon, the one I got from the Gulf of Gunthak. However, I
can't combine the words into the spell, I've tried with a quill and
parchment, and have tried without too. I was under the impression that a
Wizard with a skill of 200 in research could make spells for other Int
casting classes.

Any ideas as to what (if anything) I'm doing wrong? ..

Many thanks,

Stevie.
