My 61 Enchanter just dinged Dire Charm, and I'm wondering if there
is a good reference for mob levels somewhere.  Allakhazam bestiary
isn't bad, but I'd like something more accurate.

Or, better yet, is there an in-game way to determine precise mob
level on my own?  I suppose I could hire a L46 PC to follow me
around for ten minutes and yell whenever something cons white...
