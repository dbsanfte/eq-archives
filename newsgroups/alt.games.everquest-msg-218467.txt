Yes, so am I. Oh and you do it again - define which ones are serious, you 
make no qualification on what is required or what it means.

It has a great deal to do with the point. Im talking genetic problems and
serious ones. Nothing to do with grisly accidents. Down's would be a good
example. This makes me wonder just how much you actually know about these
things.

And here you make the point again - you are doing zero assessment just
blithely throwing a number around. Whats the required number? What are the
effects on the kid? What does it mean.

You just pulled a global statement, full of vaguaries, made absolutely no
asessment of all conditions and what these numbers meant (you can't of
course because the range of such diseases and their effects is vast. but
that is precisely my point).

THere is no single simple answer of the sort you promoted, because there
is no single simple set of conditions on these sorts of inheritances.
