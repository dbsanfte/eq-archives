I really don't know how this happened, but it happend twice in a row.

I hopped on the boat to go from FP to BB last night. I have two
computers connected to a KVM switch (2-Computers, 1-KB, 1-Mouse,
1-Monitor), so once I zoned into Ocean of Tears, I sat down, away from
the boat ramp areas, and switched over to my other computer to pass
the time surfing the web during the trip.  After a good 10 minutes or
so, I switch back over to check on the boat only to find myself
standing on the docks on Sister Isle (I think it's Sister Isle, it's
the first stop on the way to BB).  Now I have no idea how this
happened, but I decide to take advantage of the situation and do a
little exploring - I know, famous last words. Long story short, my
corpse was dropped neatly back on the dock with the help of a named
npc and I was sent back to FP nekked as a jay bird.

Np I thought. I'll just catch the next boat. I sit to mem spells while
I wait. When finished, I close my spell book I see the boat sitting at
the dock! (Thanks for the shout out you other passengers) so I jump to
my feet, attempt to spin and run for the gangplank and - lag - I wind
up in the water. AAAARRRRGGGHHH! Needless to say I missed the boat.

I catch the next one. Hop off at Sister Isle, loot my corpse and don't
quite make it back to the boat before it departs for BB. Np I thought
again, I'll gate back to FP and catch the next one (not knowing the
cycles of boat activity - probably should have just waited there). I
catch the next one, zone into Ocean of Tears, sit in an apparently
safe spot and switch to other PC for a few minutes. When I switched
back? You guessed it. I was standing on the Sister Isle docks again!

Has ANYONE had ANYTHING like this happen to them? I mean, my char had
to stand up and move off the boat - and only when it was stopped at
the island - all without any actions on my part. TWICE! This is no
fluke, but it IS very strange, not to mention COMPLETELY frustrating.

Any ideas? I'm stumped.
