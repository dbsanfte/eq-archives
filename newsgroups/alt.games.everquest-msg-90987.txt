just a suggestion, dont go to DAoC, graphics wise its not as complex but  i
think the game looks cartoonish
keep your eq stuff, the probs will soon be fixed
i had the boat vanish prob and it drove me up a wall, but after 6 emails
from tech support, downloading new detonator drivers(not sure why, i got an
ati card), and flaming tech support because of the detonator drivers, the
prob was fixed
