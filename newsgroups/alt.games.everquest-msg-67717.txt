*I agree with you that it is more constructive to give details yada yada
yada...
*I also agree with other people that said that Win95 shouldn't be expected
to
  be supported forever, heck even MICROSOFT has dropped support for it.
*Heck I will even go on record that DT's "get a life and a system" has a
place
  in this newsgroup to get the whining over with.
*But I also think that the whiners and petitioners and threateners all have
their
  place in the newsgroup also. If noone whined or petitioned, software
companies
  have been known to take their sweet time fixing problems, leading to
patches
  that take weeks or months to be released. While that isn't much of a
problem
  in Team Fortress Classic or any of the other games that are free to play
online,
  EQ is a pay to play service. They make us pay each month to play the game
  so it is my opinion that we can expect certain things from them. Like not
changing
  the specs midstream without warning and making the game unplayable by a
  significant portion of their customers. Imagine you buying a car and
making
  payments for 2 years, only to have the auto industry to change what cars
run on.
  Now it wont be a problem as long as you can still get gas for your car,
but if they
  just stop selling gas and switch to the other fuel overnight, you would
own a 4000
  pound 25000 dollar yard ornament.... This is close to what they have done.
The
  whiners and petitioners may not actually be getting anything constuctive
done to
  fix the game, but they are a driving force. As the saying goes, "the
squeeky wheel
  gets the grease"  consider them the squeek.  Some just squeek louder and
longer
  than others! 8-)
