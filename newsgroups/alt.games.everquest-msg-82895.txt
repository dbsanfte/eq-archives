Obviously? I hope you are joking. Once again, an overeaction due to
assumptions? But, before you guys jump all over me again, let me explain
why...

IMHO I related "Nimblethorne" to Rouges being nimble by design (After all,
they are thieves) and thorne referencing the offensive capabilities of the
the class or possibly refering to the common rogue melee weapon, the dagger.
Never did I associate it with some sort of phallic reference.

The GM went so far as to ask me if I had another name I'd like to use or if
I wanted him/her to assign one for me. I told him/her to go ahead and assign
me one. He/she even asked me if I liked the name rather than simply
assigning a random one. If anything, the GM did not make a big deal of my
original name all and said he/she was simply resonding to another player's
complaint.
