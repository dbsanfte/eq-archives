Subject: Question Regarding LDoN level differences...

In the original booklet that came with LDoN it mentions that as you get higher
in level, there can be a greater difference in the levels of people that can
group for an LDoN (up to a 10 level difference).  

I'm lvl 60 now (FINALLY!  WOOT!  hehe) and still can't find people willing to
group more than 7 levels difference.  By that I mean, they won't even try it
because it 'can't' be done.  It seems to me though, that if you can eventually
group up to 10 levels different, that from lvl 55 up you can group with up to
level 65.  Not that many lvl 65's are pounding down the doors to group with lvl
55's, but this came up in guild recently when one member would have been
excluded because she was 57 and not 58 and we would have had a lvl 65 with us.

From what I understood, that should not have been a problem any longer, but
when I mentioned the 10 level difference, nobody in my guild knew what I was
talking about.

If any of that made any sense...  Help?  LOL
