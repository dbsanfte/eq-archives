/quote:

"It always seems the lowering of power to a class happens fast while the
legit complaints of several classes get ignored.
Exploits bugs get fixed fast, as they should. Nerfs happen in days to 
weeks. Fixes take months."

/end quote

I concede that he then made some irrelevant comments about technical 
bugs from prePoP... but I took the above quote to imply that he beleived 
there were in fact legit problems that were being ignored while the nerf 
bat was brought out again. Note he specificlly mentions "legit 
complaints of several classes" implying that its is not a general 
complaint about the state of, for want of another example, the boats.
