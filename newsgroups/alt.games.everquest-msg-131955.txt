i believe "allegedly" is the key word:

PBS CEO Pat Mitchell pointed out to lawmakers today that it is not PBS but a
federal agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development, that is
helping fund Takalani Street, the South African version of Sesame Street
that has just introduced an HIV-positive Muppet character.  That was part of
Mitchell's response to House Energy and Commerce Chairman Billy Tauzin.

************
The main thrust of her letter, however, was to assure Tauzin and other
concerned House Republicans that 'there are no plans to incorporate this
character or curriculum into Sesame Street on PBS,' and directing them to a
July 12 Sesame Workshop statement to that effect.
************

Mitchell pointed out that Sesame Street producer Sesame Workshop is an
independent contractor with PBS, and thus she has no control over what they
do internationally.  But she said that no PBS or CPB funds go to Takalani
Street.  Tauzin and other House Republicans had sent her a letter expressing
their concerns after a Washington Post report that such a character was
being introduced into the South African version, and speculation elsewhere
that such a character might possibly be introduced in the U.S.  In
announcing the new Muppet character today, Sesame Workshop points out that
it is estimated that one in nine South Africans (4.7 million) are infected
with the HIV virus.  USAID resident Director in South Africa Dirk Dijkerman
called the addition of the character in South Africa: 'a tremendous teaching
opportunity that will reach almost 14 million people per week via radio and
TV.' (John Eggerton - Broadcasting & Cable)
