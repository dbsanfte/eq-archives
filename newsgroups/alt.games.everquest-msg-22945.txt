If you use what abilities you both have and are not in a hurry, this
combo will take you a very long way if not all the way to 60.  You have
to pick your targets well and can expect some downtime at certain
levels, but a good shaman can keep a warrior doing what they do best
very well.  It's mostly a matter of how much downtime is acceptable to
you.  Add in a cleric around 40 and you can avoid the downtime in the
later stages where you'll really feel it.  Cleric handles some of the
buffs and heals giving the shaman more med time as well as mana to use
on dots instead of just slowing.  Just be careful where you walk, two
Ogres can trample an awful lot of Gnomes w/o even trying heh.
