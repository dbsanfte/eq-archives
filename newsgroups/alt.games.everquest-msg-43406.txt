I'm an IT professional and I didn't realize until a few months after they
were both out that they weren't one and the same...kinda embarrassing to
admit that. :)

(then again, I maintain that the butterfly ballots in Palm Beach Co, Florida
ARE confusing at a glance)

Unfornately it looks like there's going to be *3* flavors of XP...one for
home, one for a workstation, and one for a server.  Wouldn't surprise me if
there's also something akin to an enterprise server version as well.  Well
duh...dump the "home" flavor & just make it the same as workstation.  Win2k
is soooooo  close to being an extremely viable home/gaming OS.
