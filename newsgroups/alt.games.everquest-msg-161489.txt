Put your money where your mouth is and pass your stuff out on the way
out. Feel free to supply links to pictures of you doing this with
testimonials from the players who get your things.


On the other hand, you can be like all the others and just reactivate
your account when you discover that it's nothing great after about
three months.

I have beta 5 games and frankly to date they have fallen close to
equal and less to EQ IMO.
