Ok, i've called tech chat (3 minutes after they opened, was already swamped,
had to wait on hold long distance for 15 minutes.. /sigh), guy told me my
motherboard drivers needed to be updated (dangit, I did that two months ago,
I need to keep up).  I couldn't use the latest video (nvidia) drivers,
because they crashed my computer, so maybe I couldn't use them because I
didn't have the latest motherboard drivers (actually VIA drivers).  So maybe
by updating those drivers my computer will let me update my video drivers
which may solve my problem of EQ closing on me every couple minutes without
any error message or anything.  At this moment, I envy those of you who are
going link dead.. at least you can watch EQ as it goes bye bye.. mine just
*poofs*, hello desktop.  Ok, cross your fingers for me, please.  So i'm
downloading the 40.09 nvidia drivers now, already updated my VIA 4in1s..
seemed to have worked.

ps - I've died at least 40 times because of this problem.. kiting cougars
with my druid.. eq closes.. log back on, dead.. lost at least 600pp worth of
KEI from this.. I really hope this works.
