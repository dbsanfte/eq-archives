I symathise with wanting to try Ice Comet .. I was exactly the same .. You
find however that it will most lkely be resisted badly .. the only spell
that will probably stick at that lvl is Enticement of Flame .. even then it
will be a low stick.  You will get best results against dragons with the
Lure line of spells which you will get a bit later .. good luck
