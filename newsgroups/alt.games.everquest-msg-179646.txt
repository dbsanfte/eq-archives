Ok DT gota call bullshit again.

Dont get me wrong have nothing against making a buck just be honest
about it.

Wages in Customer Service, IT, and software developement have gone
down due to the amount of work and contracts being shipped overseas
and softness of the economy. Wish that wasnt true but it is very real.
However I hear the price of Vice Presidents "In charge of milking the
system", remain very high. Prob a lot of those were added.

Price of hardware as gone WAY down this applies to both servers and
network gear. Even more dramatic if you compare cost to performance
ratios. Besides you think they pay retail for this stuff? Not hardly,
Im betting 40% discounts minimum just from what Ive seen on large
orders lately, even Cisco is digging for orders. Geez man cant believe
you threw this out there.

Energy costs are up but thats not a large percentage of costs anyway.

From this and from SoE's own releases on increased subsciptions Id say
cost per user down at least 10% over last year. Anything less would
denote horrid incompetence.

Come on DT the only thing going up is greed. You only make yourself
look stupid throwing this crap out there.
