If it was another class's guildleader, then its understandable. Didn't
have any trouble training there, though. Faction standing is the only
thing that determines whether you can deal with merchants or
guildleaders for your class, though. Race/class/diety/any combination
of or none of the above do impact faction with them, depending on the
NPC, though. But, in the nearly 5 years now that I've played, I've
never encountered a merchant that conned above dubious nor a
guildleader for my class that conned above apprehensive that wouldn't
deal with me, no matter the race they were or city they were in.
