Fossil fuels are just old vegetation that has rotted/fermented they are just
complex cho chains . It is renewable but would take a long time;) The
enviromental attack on oil is primarily an attack on capitalism and property
rights in the pursuit of socialism, though many real enviromentalists dont
realize that there gullibility is being abused. A quick check on a real
enviromentalist is the nuclear question. Any real enviromentalist loves
nuclear and hates hydroelectric.

Clean fusion would be very nice. It is a forced reaction requiring great
heat and pressure and by its very nature can never become uncontained. Can
be clumsy with fusion and like a car when it stops running you just get a
tow and a fix. Fission is far more like an airplane, oops aint gonna cut it.
On the sad side the hot fusion being researched now requires d2o which is
even more valuable than uranium 238 and is just as limited a resource.

Ordinary electric cars are not better because the means to produce the
electricity is usually a gas or coal power plant. The hybrids on the road
now produce far less pollution then a electric car would since there engine
is so much better. A small 2 stroke engine can be made really well these
days. Hydrogen is remarkedly easy to produce from water but requires
electricity just like everything else. Also splitting water produces lots of
oxygen which really is quite toxic unlike co2 which is what the enviro
ommunists are always yelling about.

Alchol works fine as a fuel and is completely renewable on a yearly basis.
It is however more expensive to produce than gasoline is . Best guess is
that once economies of scale where fully realized the cost of a gallon of
alchol fuel would be about $4. It puts a cap on how much fuel can ever cost
us but it is still cheaper atm to dig it up. It is not particularly energy
intensive to make, do not know where you got that information :)
