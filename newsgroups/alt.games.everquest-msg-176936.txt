As a late Christmas present my parents are planning on buying me the new
GeForceFX card when it comes out.  I was wondering if anyone could take an
educated guess on about how long it will take for it to go down in price the
first time and about how much it would be?  If it's gonna drop 50 bucks
after a month, I don't mind waiting a bit for it... nice of me, huh?
Anyways, just some guesses from what happens when other cards come out would
be nice, thanks.

~Snared.
