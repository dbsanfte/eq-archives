The problem is that in most zones, the place you wipe out is some place that
you had to fight to get to.  Say you've got 4 groups.  You've spent a couple
hours fighting your way in.  Something goes wrong, people start dying, and
one group manages to evac out, and everyone else dies, except for a FD'ed
Necro.  Necro rezes a Cleric, and Cleric rezes everyone else who died.

Now you've got three groups deep in the dungeon, and one at the inzone (or
God knows where, if it wasn't the in-zone evac that was used), possibly with
no way to rejoin the raid, if the dungeon is one in which a single group
can't fight its way in.
