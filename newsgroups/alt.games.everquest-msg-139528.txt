a) you're a cross-poster. b) you must live under a rock or something. most
everyone in here has known about the two different versions for at least 3
months now. you're not getting "ripped off" at all. the discs that you just
returned contain the theatrical release of the movie. the set that comes out in
november will *not* be the theatrical release, but will contain an additional
30 minutes to the movie that reveals more character insight, and there are some
more battle scenes along with other assorted extras. c) if that pisses you off,
then you'll probably go postal when you find out that a 3rd disc set is rumored
for february (although i have yet to find any sources to substantiate this
claim.

simmer down there, honcho.
