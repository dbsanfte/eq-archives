From the shadows, the mysterious Darktyger

conspiratorially whispered:

He wanted to know if mob experience was set by its level or by its
con. For example, if he were L35, he asked if all mobs blue gave the
same experience, or if L31 mobs gave a certain amount, L32 mobs a
slightly larger amount, L33 mobs slightly more, etc (all dark blue in
this example). The general answer is of course its based on level and
the con is just a helping aid for the player. The number crunching
computer ignores it, other than greens (zero exp regardless of level)
and wherever the maximum exp per kill cutoff is in red territory.

He appears to have been well aware of the level spreads between cons.
This wasn't a newbie question, really.

Get over what, Darktyger?
