HEHE-no I'm a shaman.  Don't know what the spawn time is, but it's not bad.
Just watch out for Trillcor (named fiend) and Fireclaw (named Underbulk)
they are pretty easy to solo alone, but if they pop with friends they will
bring at least one with them and then it can get ugly.

Because Echo is right off of SH it's a really easy zone to grab some quick
exp when you only have a little time to play.
