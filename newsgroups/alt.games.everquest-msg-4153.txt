From what I can gather, you could create an infinite number of epic
swords by just creating another one using the empty scabbard and a sword
of runes, having handed your first sword to someone. If the epic sword
is nodrop (I guess it would be) it wouldn't have mattered since you
could, I believe, transfer nodrop items using the new 'fixed' ovens :)

Can't imagine why they wanted to plug that hole...
