Damn, they found you out, it's not only Biz and Lok but DT and Dan H too.
What will happen now is they will with either come clean and then VI will
send a clean up squad of Cybernetically engineered Sony Super Soldiers to
eradicate the 4 of them...or they'll change their posting names.
Well, that's about as likely as Biz and Lokari being GM's so you might want
to consider it a strong  possibility in your world. The rest of us will just
laugh at you for having the brains of an unwashed sock puppet.
