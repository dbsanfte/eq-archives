Found this post at M-Business.  Seeing that the nerf took place prior to POP
release, LoY release, LDoN release and GoD release does anyone else just
feel this SOE employee's statement has loss any credibility it once had?
The "Uber-Tank" statement seems so over the top even though this was said
1.5 years ago.  Problem is I hope the people at SOE still do not believe the
hype that monks were Uber-Tanks.

This is the response at a Fan Faire post Monk Nerf by Alan VanCouvering,
Community Relations Manager, Everquest:

"With the change to Monks have they achieved the result you wanted?

At this point we don't think that we have achieved what we wanted with
Monks. Right now it seems to be having too much of an impact on Monks who
aren't the top 5%. We'll be going back and looking into it some more.

We were really happy with the projected results our internal testing had for
the changes, but that just didn't pan out when it went onto the live
servers.

Monks won't be going back to the uber-tanks they were, but there will be
more changes made to try to more accurately reflect our intent."

So what have these changes been?  Huhh?  Still waiting............
