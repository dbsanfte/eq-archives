I agree also. He didn't want to bother selling it full price so you got a
deal. Be happy.

Someone gave me a level 60 water pet spell the other day. This thing is
worth thousands to the right person. Someday maybe I'll try and sell it.
Most likely I'll give it away to some nice high level mage. I think a
windfall of thousands of plat would ruin the game for me. I'm just at the
point now where I can go get some good items on my own. It's not always
about making plat or leveling as fast as possible. Enjoy the journey.
