You have a few different problems here......

1. Mammoths are good exp for their level and many players like to hunt
them. There are never enough to go around, so it isn't unusual for
people to attack first and ask questions later.

2. Mammoths are wandering mobs, not static spawns. A Snared mammoth
looks the same as a non-agro one walking through the zone. 

3. Everfrost is hill country with lots of Z-Axis changes. This causes
players and mobs to warp in and out of sight depending on their
relative elevation to each other.

Your best bet is to Root/DoT and avoid the risk of pulling your kite
past other players, find a better place to hunt, or resign yourself to
the situation.
