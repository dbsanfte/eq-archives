Yep. They charge $75ish for any on site tech help, it sucks during the
weather, the equipment is expensive and if it dies the customer has to
suck up the cost to replace it, gets sucky reception during bad
weather and overall sucks shit.

Did I mention I work for the cable company? ;-)

How about the customer that called us and wanted us to send a tech out
to hook his dish up.

Me: "Press and hold in the power button on the front of the box."
CS: "Ok."
<minute passes>
Me: "Did the time change to the word Boot?"
CS: "No."
Me: "Did you press and hold the power button on THE FRONT OF THE BOX?"
CS: "Oh, you mean not on the remote?"

ARGHHH!!

Amen.
