We had a pretty intense day recently.  We've been trying to get Jade 
Reavers for our Rangers and Druids off an on lately and decided to go back 
the other night.

It was camped, so we did the Corrupted DE in EK, then headed to CoM.  We 
made our way to the BR building and were buffing and planning.  The rogue 
opened the door and a druid harmonied a lot of the room real fast.  Out of 
nowhere, a necro pet runs in and jumps on the BR.  Pet dies fast and BR and 
3 friends come out.  Rak is already up and standing outside with us off to 
the side.

We aren't a big guild and pretty much no one has any great stuff ( no Keal 
armor, no planes armor, etc ) and we had only 1 cleric with us out of 12 
people.  At least 5 of the people were levels 40-50.  We had fought BRs 
before and never got more than 2 in the chain.

I mez 2 of the adds, and charm the other and sic it on the BR.  BR goes 
down, and another spawns.  We take it down, and another spawns.  Rinse - 
repeat.  We ended up taking down 8-10 of them ( no one has bothered to 
check the logs, yet ) and then Ghiosh spawns.  The MA falls in the water 
with Ghiosh at about 30% life, and Ghiosh disappears ( I was handling adds 
at the time so missed it ).  I notice Ghiosh is gone, hit my assist key, 
and pick him up and ask where he is.  "Water!" is the answer.  I don my EB 
necklace, and jump in and mem Rune V and Everlasting Breath.  By the time I 
find the MA to Rune and EB him, he's dead, but others have jumped in and 
are fighting / healing.  SA takes over seamlessly and I ask who needs EB 
and get a few answers so I start EBing people.  Ghiosh goes down and we all 
get out of the water and clear back to ethe building then Celebrate like 
crazy.

That was a major accomplishment for us, mainly because it was so unexpected 
and we handled it ( except for losing the MA in the water ).  I personally 
didn't think we'd be able to handle more than 3 of them back-2-back with 
the particular personnel we had, but everyone did an awesome job.

We pulled the rest of the BRs ( except for the one at the end of the walk 
), and then waited for the main one to pop again.  We ended up with 2 Jade 
Reavers for our troubles.

It wasn't the most fun I've had in EQ, but it was definitely the most 
intense.  My previous most intense moment was a 6-man group at the Sarnak 
fort where I "came into my own" as a chanter and saved the day.

We had an "Oh Shit" moment in Fear this past Friday. I had been to Fear 
only once and it had been a total wipe.  This time, the break-in was 
flawless and we had cleared to and killed Fright.  We started moving to 
Mini #2 and all of the sudden, CT starts yelling ( he had just spawned ).  
Being a Fear rookie, I didn't know what that meant, except avoid his area 
=)

*pop*  *pop*   *pop*   Zone repops on us, and I immediately get "summoned" 
a bit aways from the mass of people ( but, without a summon message ) and I 
start to get beat on.  It was ugly from there on out.  Clerics didn't get 
camped, etc.  Luckily, the guild that was up for CT in the rotation had 
about 40 people on and broke in and summoned all the corpses and clicked 
the whole raid force.  Very nice of them.  The Karana high-end guilds have 
always taken time out to help the lowers in bad situations.

There there was the 5-hour ToFS incident last night, but it's too 
embarassing to relate here.  I did get my master key, though.
