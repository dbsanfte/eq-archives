This can happen with Fear. I have seen it happen couple of times at least.
Someone will be fighting a spider and either Instill Doubt it or Fear it.
The spider runs off all over the ramps and ends up pathing into the castle.
This chain aggros the gars and their path is thru upper dogs.

In your situation I would be 100% sure that the mardy childish pally DA
himself and pulled the train expecting DA to last long enough for him to
escape through CE.

He is one of the many morons that makes EQ unplayable sometimes. Bit like
the rogue who missed a roll on something he wanted and claimed NBG on in Seb
Crypt. Off he went without us noticing and we were locked in. Another rogue
came shortly afterwards and we continued afresh but would have been bad for
the melees that couldn't gate out
