But I swear, I saw a cleric solo Gore! Honest! I also saw one tanking 
AoW! ;)

Anyway, don't forget that this was in a rather optimal situation too 
since I didn't tank so no stuns or having to back off to heal all the 
time. Also the mob was undead that the hammer has a big (+10) damage 
bonus to.

On the other hand I could've added pet and MoR for some extra damage, 
but it's not that much really (and I should get my copy of PoP in the 
mail today so I'm not going back to get logs tonight, damnit! :) ).
