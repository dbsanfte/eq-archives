It's debatable whether this is such a great thing or not.

Oh, I know of a *huge* reason to do so, provided it helps. I never knew 
that killing frogs in the swamp would make it tough to run through UGuk 
to get to LGuk, so I killed some for xp when young and now have to hassle 
with invis and such to get to the dead part of Guk. I'm guessing this 
faction issue is fixable now.

I'd *love* to hear any reasonable alternatives to this. Throwing a bit of 
hassle into the mix keeps everyone from running around with a fungi 
tunic.

I don't think I will enjoy SWG much, simply because I much prefer the 
fantasy genre as opposed to Sci-Fi.

No offense, but you sure are an EQ wet blanket. I also would like to know 
if you still play, out of curiosity.
