Woah, there. I had a very unpleasant experience the other day with
someone with that attitude. He /WTB <an item I have rotting in the bank>
I tell him I have one to sell if he wants it and do a /who. He's level
19. I suspect he can't afford what it's actually worth, so I say, "Well,
it's just rotting in the bank, make me an offer", fully intending to
accept whatever he comes up with. He gets all snotty and tells me rather
rudely that "he doesn't play that game." I /tell him, "Excuse me? I've
just offered to sell you what you want at a price you can afford." Yes,
I would have taken a lowball price if it wasn't too unreasonable, say
within 50% of it's actual worth, and no, I would not have accepted more
than it was worth had he offered me too much. I am neither a thief nor a
ripoff artist; I simply want to free up a spot in my bank account, make
a bit of plat, and perhaps help a lowbie at the same time. OTOH, I have
no real interest in equipping some level 60s twinkie on the cheap or
helping out the buy low/sell high crowd as I would probably be doing if
I simply offered to sell at a lowball price on the front end. "Make me
an offer" is the best way I can think of to accomplish the first goal,
whilst hopefully avoiding the second. 

I must be missing something here; I admit, I don't spend a lot of time
in EC because I hate it so much. Why on earth *wouldn't* you make an
reasonable/affordable offer if someone asked you to and you wanted the
thing they were selling, assuming you have a clue what it's worth
yourself? I generally have a pretty good idea what the value of what I'm
selling is; but I have absolutely no way to know what kind of budget the
buyer is on. It has absolutely nothing to do with the "honorable
tradition of haggling". I freaking *hate* haggling; my husband gets to
do all the car buying in our family. =P I ask them to offer so that I
don't scare the beejeesus out of them when I come back with full price
if that's way over budget for them, seeing as how the vast majority of
the time, I'd rather sell cheap than spend hours sitting on my butt in
EC waiting for someone who actually does have the cash to come along.
Also, frankly, I'd rather sell inexpensively to a real newbie/lowbie as
opposed to getting top dollar from someone buying for their twink. In
any case, he was still auctioning /WTB when I left. No loss to me; his
foolishness saved me a trip to the bank. /shrug

Moral of the story: Not everyone who asks you to make an offer is trying
to rip you off. Some really are just trying to arrive at a mutually
agreeable price, without getting ripped off themselves.
