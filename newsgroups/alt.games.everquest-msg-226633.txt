When I was playing mostly old-models, I'd always pick the male Iksar over 
the females 'cause I thought they looked better.  And then again, some 
characters just pop up "male" in my head.  Somehow, the Iksar necromancer 
who was a coward and liked to write (gothic and BAD) poetry on the sly was 
more fun as a male character.

Come to think of it, I'm much more likely to play a "weak" male character 
than a weak female one.  Maybe because so many people expect a woman to be 
a wilting flower.  Which isn't to say all my male characters are weak; my 
most successful RP character ever (whose on GarouMUSH, a text-only game 
based on Werewolf: the Apocalypse) is quite the hardass.  I've actually 
shocked people who find out that Salem's played by a woman.  :>
