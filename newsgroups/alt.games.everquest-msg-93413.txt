actually there are some npcs in seru that are kos to all even if you are nonkos
to others with similar names some npcs are on seru faction itself which is
different than the city faction.That can only be raised through quests in seru
is necessary for a quest to get into arxwhere seru and his personal guard are
which are all initially kos a few random npcs in city outside arx are on same
faction.
