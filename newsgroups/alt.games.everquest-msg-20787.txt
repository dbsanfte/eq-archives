I fought mostly outside vs dungeons.

Fight near a zone boundry or 3 steps from a guard.

If your root breaks, run. If you fizzle, run.

OR

Your bolt spells are really long range and do good damage. Monster speed is
depends on their health level. If you can target a monster that is still in
range but moving away from you, they will be in the next county before you
bolt hits them. Not uncommon to be able to get off 3 bolts before the
monster even reaches you w/o rooting.

At that stage you can run for 30-40 seconds and fire off another bolt or
two. If these don't kill it, you should be oom by then so hug the
guards/zone.

Wizards can kite after a fashon if they get a SoW. Just [bolt, run]^n until
monster is dead. Not rooting means another direct damage spell. Fizzles or
resisted spells mean time to zone. You get good at hitting number lock and
holding down the ctrl + arrow keys to put distance between you and wounded
monsters.

Try to do it with non aggresive stuff as much as possible so you don't drag
them on top of lower level players. Don't fight poisonous or diseased stuff
if it can be avoided.

You need line of sight for bolt spells.
