My rant for the day.

Why do people complain when an obvious exploit is stopped?
The answer you get is "Its not against the rules". This always pisses me
off.
Its pretty obvious, that being able to get a creature in a certain spot,
where he can do nothing but take hits is an exploit.

It always reminds me of a problem with rugby (Its a game like gridiron
but without the protective equipment, and also a lot faster) a few years
ago. Someone had physically hurt another player in a game (with his knee
I believe), but was unable to be fined or suspended because the rules
didnt cover that particular offence.

If you find an exploit, feel free to use it, until stopped. Dont
complain after it is stopped though.
