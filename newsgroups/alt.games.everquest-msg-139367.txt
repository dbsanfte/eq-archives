Of course it is. They have little trained monkeys that read every single one
of the million or so posts archived every few hours, looking for your
"cancel" preface in the subject field.

Are you really this stupid?

Cool! Why don't we all email Google to cancel every single EQ usenet post
from the beginning of his one-way journey into mental illness?

What an imbecile.

Yes, I do believe you are an imbecile in the real world, too.

Does it really help to keep repeating that to yourself in the mirror? After
all, you're still here doing the same thing to yourself with each proceeding
post.

Look at how desperate you've become to preserve your dignity. You're trying
to convince the entire world we only exist in your home grown news server.

It must be a sad existence for you, being Usenet bitch.
