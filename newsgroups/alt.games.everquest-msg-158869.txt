Triggered. In over two years, I've never seen the spawned version alive.

But yes, I see you point. Now I remember reading the the spawned version

However, we've also done Talendor, Gore, and Sev, albeit with quite a
few more people than triggered Fay. And Gore has a nasty AoE also, but
we seem to manage that.
