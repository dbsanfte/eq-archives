I don't think you can go wrong picking a tank class and a healer combo for 2
boxing. I use a Warrior/Druid combo that's fun. Warrior pulls and auto
attacks, druid snares, damage shields and DOTs, then sits down. Back to
Warrior for Kicks/Bash/whatever until dead. I set up a hot key on the druid
to stand/heal and keep the Warrior targeted so it's just one key to heal.

I have a friend that plays a Shaman/Monk combo and he rocks. I have grouped
with him and you can't tell they are both being played by the same person.
He even roleplays them different, and will have them talk to each other in
/group. It's more than I could handle. I rarely will group if I'm 2 boxing,
and if I do I make sure the group knows it and is okay with it.

It's a great way to "solo" classes that can't solo well, but in a group I
feel I should devote my whole attention to one character.
