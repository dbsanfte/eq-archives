I guess if you consider good gear PLing (NOT level 56 gear other than the
hammer of stiking which are about 10k on my server) then I am PLing. If you
mean I have a high level helping that is not true. I don't even have temp. I
went to Paineel, Warrens, then PC and was 24 in about 8 hours (maybe 10
which would add about 2 hours to my 12 hour total). I did group with a
cleric my level or shaman for all of that. Who ever I was grouped with
leveled a little earlier than I did, but I switched partners often because I
did do heads down leveling for every night, and camped where I was going to
be the next night.
