No, read what I wrote again and you'll see that.  Not X to Y.  X to Y to
X to Y such that the mob is unable due to pathing to follow the same
route.  In effect the mob must run away from you to get closer.  Now

or someone's mother, its all  the same as if you were jumping over
nothing at all so long as the above is true.

So there are dangers to your method of exploiting pathing?  Well then by
all means exploit away.
