Yeah but that is kind of the problem. Many players have just one main
char because they have taken the time to play that char and they DON'T
have the time to also get a char to 15, 25, 35 and 45 in addition to
the 52 or so character they already have.

Unless this difference is really stressed by Verant, and explained to
the players a lot, many of these players will buy Luclin thinking
their characters can go and enjoy it and do quests and things there.
Many of these players will be far more casual about getting info on EQ
and just go and read the box, which I seriously doubt will say
"Warning: if you only have a higher level character it won't be able
to do jack here for the most part."
