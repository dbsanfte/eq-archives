Why make it sound so difficult???

I have 5 binders (not the big 7cm ones, the small 3cm ones!!)
one with both Faydwer and Odus, and the rest of the continents (and Luclin)
in their own binders.

On EQAtlas there is a zone-overview for all continents
which I have at the very begining of each binder,
then just put in the zones as they are listed from top left downwards (not
right) to bottom right.

You'll get a very nice sorta correct-connected zone layout.

Well just my 2 cp :o)
