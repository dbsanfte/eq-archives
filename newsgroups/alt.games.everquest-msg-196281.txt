If it was unclear to you, I was poking Ed about his generalizations,
like "Men want them.  Women want to be them.", along with various
snide comments by him and others in the thread suggesting that any

OTOH, if you're trying to suggest that I have claimed to "understand
the minds and emotions of over 6 billion strangers" (or even a few
million, for that matter), please cite the offending post(s).
