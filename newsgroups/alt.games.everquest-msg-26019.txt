Don't be surprised if at 20 damage is not all that great.  It will generally
be roughly twice the damage of the weapon max with about 1 extra point per
level.  At 30 it gets much better and  40 becomes really nice, as an example
my level 40 ranger regularly hits for around 20 with a Short Sword of Morin.
The key to weapon damage is not single hits but speed which when coupled
with double attack can make for some really amazing damage.  Also you must
remember that for every high hit you get you are likely to get even more low
hits when you are in your early 20s.  This can get really frustrating and to
a degree be offset by faster weapons or weapons that proc for damage.
Around lvl 25 the cheap velium weapons begin to do this and can make up for
a world of other weaknesses in you attack.
