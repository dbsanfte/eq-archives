Well, why does my velious Bracer have a 20 second cast time?

Would instant cast shurikens be overpowering?  Oh look instant cast
shurikens, I'll go kite Gore..

I agree the usefullness of the spells is very limited.. they are almost a
novelty or bonus spell.. and for that reason, they made it so a lot of
people wouldn't have it.  Anyway wouldn't componentless Lev and EB kill the
newbie money making market?   This could kill the lower level economy!!

I don't see how the usable by 3 classes is relevant?

In Velious at least, they tuned the drops to match the number of classes who
could wear..  e.g you would see a lot more plate items drop than anything
(look at the huge list who can use).

You would also see a lot more silk drop than leather
(wizz/chanter/mage/necro versus druid and monk wearable)

Not everybody is meant to have every spell.. thats why you can't just buy
them from merchants.   As for ancient spells.. don't expect to ever get any,
and if you get even 1, consider yourself extremely lucky.
