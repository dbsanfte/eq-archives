Backstab damage is increased by (generally in order of importance)

1) The damage rating of your weapon
2) How high your backstab skill is
3) Strength

Level does not really enter into it, other than allowing you to gain higher
backstab skill. (and some big bonuses once you start going over level 50, I
believe)

You've already got a very good weapon for backstabbing, as there aren't a lot
of high damage piercers around... well, at least not many without astronomical
prices.

If you're really after that higher backstab, you can pick up a Bloodstained
Fang (9 dam 32 delay) for under 100 pp.  However I don't think the extra
backstab damage would make up for the worse ratio.  Also, the Crystal Grinder
(9 dam 27 delay +2 ac) seems to go for around 500 pp or less on E'ci.
Depending on your definition of cheap... I think I've seen Slime Coated
Harpoons (10 damage 25 delay) selling for around 1,000 pp.  And thats about it
for even the marginally cheap piercers.
