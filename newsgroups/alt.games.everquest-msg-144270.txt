How fast do you level?  Verant is in the midst of retuning the classes, so
unless you've got friends that can powerlevel you to high level in a couple
of days, what's best *now* for high level raids might not be what's best by
the time you get there. :-)

Why "best"?  Wouldn't "useful enough that you won't have trouble getting
invited to raids" be good enough?  If so, note that one of the classes being
tuned to be more useful on raids is Druids, so maybe your current main is
good enough.

If you would be willing to give up on spells, I'd say Monk is the best bet.
In demand now, and it is unlikely any tuning of other classes will lessen
this.  The thing that makes Monks stand out from the other classes people
are going to suggest (Cleric, Enchanter, maybe Wizard, and Warrior from
those who suggest giving up on magic) is that on a raid, most other classes
do their job in a crowd.  The raid sets up a pull spot, and everything is
pulled to there, and dealt with.  If you want to actually *see* the zone,
you are out of luck--you are limited to what you can see when the raid moves
between pull spots (well, a Wizard can pass the time between pulls or while
medding playing with his Eye of Zomm or Bind Sight, so Wizards do get to see
some of the zone).

The Monk, on the other hand, is usually the one pulling the monsters to the
pull spot.  So, the Monk actually gets to go out and see the zone.

You really need to explain what you mean by "best" to get any more useful
answer.
