Sure, you can skip FP entirely, but it's terribly convenient, being at a
port, plus next to one of the big auction zones of the world, tons of
merchants and tradeskill supplies and equipment. But yes, Neriak is next
door. (Well, a couple zone lines away, anyways.) Mind you, I've never
had to do it with my characters, but those I know who have tell me that
you can hunt the halflings in Neriak, and there's a wine quest you can
do over there. (You may have to have some sort of illusion, wolf form,
etc. for that one... check allakhazams for details). But I understand
it's not terribly difficult to get in good with the dark elves.

But you may not want to blow off Freeport entirely if you plan on
haunting that area for a while anyway. There's only two guard factions
to balance if you want access to the whole city, and two merchant
factions. Once you have the guard factions ok, you can try the Janem and
Rebby note quests which will give faction with both merchant classes,
and additional good faction with the militia. My Necro started out being
unable to buy from one of the merchant factions, and apprehensive with
the other. (Terrible prices.) I'm now kindly to both and can shop most
anywhere. A sufficient number of orcs will get you into N. Freeport for
the bank. Just stay away from the Clerics, Paladins, one Bard, and that
stupid ass gnome in the blue house near the bank. (Oh.... I am SO
camping his ass when I get some more levels.)
