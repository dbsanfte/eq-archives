>>>SNIP<<<

OK, time to give out a little more info on grouping with a tank. Now, some
of this may sound like I'm blaming you, but I'm not ... just playing devil's
advocate since I only know what you told me.

>> IMO, the role of a tank is to dish out damage, take damage and protect
the casters.<<

In essence, this is the role of a tank. What might have happened is the lego
was one of the extra pops, and the tanks did not notice him right away. In
my experience, there are a lot of dwarves and gnomes in GFay, and as a dorf
I can tell you that when fighting a lego, I'm looking straight at the bottom
of his breastbone. Fighting a cent I'm looking straight into his chest, so
it's possible the lego went unnoticed. What you and the other casters should
have done was grouptelled "get the lego", so the tanks would know to grab
the big guy first.

>>>SNIP<<<
>>The tank had over half health and should have aggro from all the mobs,
thats his role isnt it?<<

The tank should have agro, but it's not an automatic thing. The tank has to
do something to get the agro, and unfortunately casters are better at
getting agro than tanks are.

>>I was unlucky to be  attacked but the tank should have jumped in and got
the orcs off me, i know he saw what was happening because i circled the
group about 3 times waiting for assistance.<<

Yes, the tank should have jumped in. I'm assuming that you saw one tank
standing there as you ran, but you didn't see the other tank. This could be
because he was chasing you trying to get the orcs off you. If this was the
case, then he should of yelled at you to stop running. Personal experience
tells me it's real hard to taunt a mob when you have to chase him down.

>> And if not the tanks then why not another caster? <<

mmmmmmmmmm.................. self preservation? just a guess, but a lot of
people get the "better him than me" syndrome when it comes to death.

>>>SNIP<<<

>>as far as im concerned i was thinking of the group by not training the
orcs on  anybody but they werent thinking about me.<<

Yes, you were thinking of the group, the first sign of a good group member.
As for the last part of this sentence, see above answer.

>>The other casters threw no damage spells, ok they may have been oom but i
thought a good caster rarely utters those words.<<

True, a good caster rarely utters these words. But, assuming your group was
between levels 6-9, the casters might not have had enough experience to be
"good". I know my mage goes OOM because I sometimes forget to look at my
mana bar. (Since I don't play him very often)

>> Now, thats my opnion but i dont have alot of experience in groups so am i
just
 being a whining baby over this or was this a bad group?<<

You were in a bad group. Actually, I would call it an inexperienced group.
Wait till you get into groups with the Supermen (we can take all 4 of those
red mobs!) and ninja looters.

>> I solo alot but i do enjoy being in groups but as a caster i rely heavily
on the tanks and when this happens it puts me off the idea.<<

Someone who needs a tank! *hug* Don't let one bad experience ruin you to
groups. Groups can be fun, and will help you fight mobs you might not be
able to solo at your current level. You will be in a lot more bad groups
before you find a good one, but when you find that good one it makes
grouping worth it.
