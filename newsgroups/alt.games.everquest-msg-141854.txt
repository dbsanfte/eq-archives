Note also that if an item has stat modifiers (e.g., WIS+10), they
too will be "downscaled" for a character of less than the
recommended level, *BUT* the item description will show only
the downscaled stat, without giving a hint of what the stat
value would be at/above the recommended level.

For example, the Belt of Uberl33tness:

   AC 20, WIS+15, recommended level of 50

If a level 8 person inspected this item, they'd see
something like:

   AC 3(20), WIS+2, recommended level of 50

They'd get no indication that higher WIS levels are available
as the character rises in level.

I suspect that this is a bug, or at least apathy on
the part of the programmers.

Yes, I like the solution that Verant chose.
