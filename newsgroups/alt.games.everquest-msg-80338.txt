You should read up on Velious armor and faction choices.  Here's
a brief summary, though.   Remember that all Velious armor needs
gems dropped in Sirens Grotto, Velks, etc. as well as an armor
component (not something you wear, it's a quest piece) found only
in certain zones.

Coldain:  dwarves
City:  Thurgadin
Kill: Giants (they don't care about dragons) to get good faction
Hunting grounds:  EW, GD, Kael
Armor component:  drops in Kael
Faction requirement for quest:  warmly (IIRC)

Claws of Veeshan: dragon
City:  Skyshrine
Kill:  Giants (they don't care about Coldain) to get good faction
Hunting grounds:  EW, GD, Kael
Armor component:  drops in ToV
Faction requirement for quest:  ally

Kromrif/Kromzek: giant
City:  Kael
Kill:  Dragons (or dwarves but it takes longer and doesn't help with
    all factions) to get good faction
Hunting grounds:  EW, GD, Western Wastes, Skyshrine, Thurgadin,
    Icewell
Armor component: drops in ToV
Faction requirement for quest:  ally

Now look at the "normal" path for someone not joining a guild
that's already Giant-aligned:   Kill giants, get good Coldain
faction and good dragon faction *and* get drops for Thurgadin
armor while you're doing it.   Then, once you've gotten some
pieces of Thurgadin armor your faction with dragons will be
high and you can get the Skyshrine (CoV) armor quests
*and* you'll be equipped well enough to maybe start doing
some ToV raids and getting Skyshrine armor.   Then you'll be
really well equipped (you're leveling and getting other loot than
the armor components) and can start killing dragons and
Coldain to get Giant faction so you can do those quests.

Saying "oh, I want Skyshrine armor" to start off is fine  *if*
you're a member of a guild that's already got CoV faction.
They can take you to Kael (or ToV) and get you to ally with
CoV in days.  But, since you said you weren't going to do
that, it's far more likely you'll get Thurgadin armor first.
And, since that's the easiest armor to get, it's also the one
that's most likely to let a non-guild member go along on raids
and roll on armor drops.

Since it's a fair bet that even Thurgadin armor is better than
what you're wearing in most slots, there's nothing wrong with
that approach.   And you're far more likely to go to Kael with
a CoV-aligned guild than ToV.  They go there to kill the bigger
mobs as well as equip newer members and to gain faction.
And you also have the benefit of being able to go to Kael with
Coldain-aligned guilds and get armor with them, too.

Divine Light is the upgrade to Remedy and used exactly the same
way.  It's a good heal for non-warriors and for use in /assist healing.

No, there will generally be more clerics than groups at that
point.  And clerics are -- generally -- always in demand.  What
you're missing, though, is that *guest* clerics aren't.  There's
plenty of clerics willing to put in the time and pay their dues
to be a part of guilds doing the endgame that guest clerics
(other than potential guild members) just aren't needed.
And guilds doing ToV -- especially ToVN -- can powerlevel a
cleric up to your level in a surprisingly short amount of time
if they need one, something that's far more likely to happen
than them inviting a guest to a ToV raid.

Level isn't important;  guild association is.  Don't expect to ever see
ToVN on a raid unless you're willing to join one of your servers top
guilds.  It's just not a place guilds take guests.   A guild capable of
staging successful ToVN raids has more than enough clerics as
members (or willing to put in their dues and become members) to
where the concept of inviting a non-member to a raid like that would
be laughable.  Not to mention something that the guild members
themselves would probably rebel against.  High-end mobs require
players with experience against them;  you're unlikely to get that
experience in ToV, even if you joined one of those guilds.  There's
far easier mobs to kill to get the basics down.
