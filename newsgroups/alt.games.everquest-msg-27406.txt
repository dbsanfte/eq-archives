/em is a evil fomr Odus, aka a Paineelian

Its fun. Though going to Qeynos and forgetting to make sure your not KOS
with the guards is a no no =p

The sewers/The Shrine/whatever is way to easy for anyone evil. All I did was
stand by the spectres so no one would PK me and pull beggers heh...The one
time I tried to go out to North Qeynos to sneak in QH and PK some people I
forgot to bank in the Shrine and I saw 2 newts and backed off into a wall
then fell and a shark started to beat me. While I was resting someone came
up blinded me then killed me heh
