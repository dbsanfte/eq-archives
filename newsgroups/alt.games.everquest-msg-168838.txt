I've seen Torpor come up for sale in the bazaar three times in about three
months and I check spells almost every day.  It was listed for 50-80k

Malo came up once for 50k

That makes these two spells WAY out of reach for many of us.  Unless I can
find a 30k batwing or two.....

Shamans are not an over powered class, they are nicely balanced for the most
part.  Shamans aren't complaining, but just want people to understand the
limitations that go with the powerful abilities they have.
