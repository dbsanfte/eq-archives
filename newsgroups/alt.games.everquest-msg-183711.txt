Well, I do thank you for once again making it clear from the outset
that you don't have a fucking clue.

You cannot know all there is to know unless you are at least competent.
You cannot be competent if you haven't been there and done that (or
been and done someplace substantially similar).  A great deal of what
you call skill is, in fact, knowledge.  And it is knowledge that
resists being cast in book form.  Playing a 60+ SK in PoP is not at all
like playing power-forward on an NBA team, except in that one sense.

What you are calling details of the class are only a fraction of the
details that must be learned well enough that they inform your decisions
while rarely being present in your conscious mind.

What you fail to understand is that "book learning" is never complete.
Only for the most mechanical of subjects can it even pretend to being
complete without being unmasked trivially.  And for topics that involve
extensive human interaction it is invariably woefully incomplete.

And where is this "elitist idiots" bullshit coming from?  Is it just
that you resent James and Martin for their supposed "uber"ness?
It seems rather clear to me that neither of them is an idiot, and
while James may be a tiny bit of an elitist (enough to encourage Jazz
to poke at him once in a while anyway), Martin sure doesn't come off
as any such thing.  And my semi-retired L55 main in his bazaar-bought
gear certainly has no place in any sort of an "elite" group.  So I ask
you:  who are these "elitist idiots" of whom you speak?
