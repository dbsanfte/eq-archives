    Looks like I'd better go get a cushion - I, and just about every level
60 in Norrath, will be rushing to Velk's/Seb/Chardok/insert XP zone here to
grind XP to get all the cool enhancements after SoL goes live. Grind grind
grind! Any bets on how much XP it'll take to actually get all possible
enhancements (since of course I ain't stopping until I have everything I can
possibly get)?
