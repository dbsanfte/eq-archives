On E'ci I saw three level ~57-65 leveling two level 20s in SK. When someone
shouted "camp check" they replied "north south middle."

Saw same exact thing in Rathe except the characters being leveled were a bit
higher and there were a few more total. They pulled/killed everything that
spawned anyway.

I don't spend a lot of time in Rathe Mountains because I have other ways of
making pp. I've only attacked maybe 9 hg there and had 3 of them KS.

The 'I didn't know it was taken' or 'it attacked me first' is probably just
cooking the books. You report them and their journal/your petition looks
like it was an honest mistake. If it really was a mistake, they will back
off or offer you the loot.

Other then the obvious pp for dollar$ I suspect there are other motives. For
instance someone who only has the first release with no expansions or free
trial.

Running up a druid on FV over the last month. I'm only killing the ones in
NK when they pop and is still pretty good ~6-70 pp per kill if you sell off
everything that drops. Overall it is a pretty civilized server. I suspect
even Rathe Mountains there is ok.
