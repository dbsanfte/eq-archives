Well, didn't EQ1 go live either without Alchemy, or with it severely broken?

For that matter, I think Alchemy (and Spellcrafting) were missing from DAoC
for something like a year after release.

I suppose, though, that since EQ2 essentially lets you be a tradeskiller
instead of an adventurer if you want, missing a tradeskill in EQ2 is much
more severe than missing a tradeskill in EQ1 or DAoC.

Yeah.  Also, not being reminded of all that makes it easier to screw up,
which can actually be entertaining.  A friend of mine needed to kill
something for a quest in DAoC.  It was a little too high for him to solo, so
he called me over to help.  I arrived, we grouped up, and he pulled...and
we'd totally forgotten about the "bring a friend" stuff, and so we got two.
Oops.  We ran away, ungrouped, and came back to try again.  He pulled, got
just the quest mob, and we both started nuking away.  However, since his pet
was meleeing the mob (we were both necros) and mine wasn't, I was using my
powertaps, whereas he had to use lifetaps to keep the pet alive.  At the
level we were, powertaps did more damage than lifetaps, so I totally KSed
him, and he didn't get the quest credit.  So, we had to try again, and this
time I was able to cut back on the damage so he got the quest.  But we were
laughing all through this--two experienced MMORPG players (we'd both done
several years of EQ, and he'd even been in one of the top uberguilds),
playing the most ridiculously overpowered class in the history of MMORPGs
(DAoC necromancers make pre-nerf EQ necromancers look like schoolgirls), and
it took us three tries to simply kill a single mob with him getting the kill
credit.  Geesh!
