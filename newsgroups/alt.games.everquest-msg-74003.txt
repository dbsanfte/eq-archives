Depends on what part of the game you are in, and of course, the
individual situation... as a mid level shaman (45 barbarian) I find
the DoT spells are in my slots far more often than slow... 
group situations may be different, but not much.  With a tank heavy
group, the only thing useful a shammy can do is haste... dot's are a
waste, as is slow. (again, this is the mid-level game, not high end,
or low end game).  STR and DEX are nice to add damage and better proc
chances, but not needed in most cases... even in a mana group, I find
myself more in the dot and sow class...
