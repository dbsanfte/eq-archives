Hey there

Quick question - I camped the room with the SK on the first level of
Befallen fo 1.5 hours this morning hoping to kill it for the 1st key.  It
never once spawned - plenty of normal skelles and Lrodd or whoever around
the corner, which I killed each and every time, but no SK. I read the spawn
time was 20 minutes.. is this right?

(on the Tunare server)

Cheers

Gorphunk
