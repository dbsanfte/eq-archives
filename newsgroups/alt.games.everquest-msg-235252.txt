My wizie friend and my ranger were minding our own business in Scarlet Desert
killing revenants when someone "/ooc Camp check please"?  So we respond.  So
they ask if we will *share*.  We say yes.  A group of six arrive, and then
clear all the revenants within the first 10 minutes.  So we /tell them that we
will move over and kill the TroJegs... they say fine.   
Well you can guess the rest.  Within 20 minutes they were pulling the TroJeg
too.  Wouldn't ya know, the guild leaders were part of the group.  And these
weren't Lower Level Idiots, they were in their 50s and 60s, (so some probably
weren't even getting experience).
No one from That Guild will ever get a rez from my cleric.  You are known by
the company you keep, after all.
