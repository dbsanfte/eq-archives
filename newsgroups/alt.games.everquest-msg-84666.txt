I was feeling all-powerful last night now that I'm a big 10th level
Paladin. I went to the Marr temple in North Freeport and went the
highest level I could on the inside, about 7 floors up. I then climbed
up on the railing and took a swan dive into the pool. It looked really
cool and was quite the freefall. However, it did 345 points of damage
and I only had 280ish. So I had to go back in to the temple and recover
my corpse while all the NPC sentries were watching me defile their pool.
I don't think they liked it. Not to mention then I went swimming and
explored the Freeport sewers, only to zone into an area and see some
lady and a skeleton pet standing right in front of me. She whacked me
good. 2nd death of the night. When I went to recover my corpse and zoned
in to where it was, I had died so close to the zone line that my corpse
was actually behind me as I zoned in. I had to actually step into the
zone and turn around to start looting, all the while afraid that this
scary lady was going to come back for me.

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
