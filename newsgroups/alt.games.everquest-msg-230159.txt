My first ever dragon raid was also in POI.  I wasn't planning on doing a raid 
that night but I zoned into POI and was just looking for an exp group.  I seen 
lots of people at the zoneline and I was invited.  We cleared our way to the 
gnome.  Picked up the gnome and then worked out way to where the dragon was.  
We all buffed up and then spawned the dragon.  As a 55 Shaman none of my 
spells would land and luckily I was never summoned.  My pet died though but we 
easily killed the dragon.  I hailed the gnome afterwards and was flagged for 
the factory.  I think we had close to 40 people total in the raid.  I kept 
quiet and just listened.  Everything went fairly smooth.
