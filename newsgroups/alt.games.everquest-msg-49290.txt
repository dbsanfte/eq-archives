Well, this statement is true for the most part.  However, I feel that the
rock solid stability of the game and the near flawless release speak
volumes.  Also, for the most part, the Beta testers were thoroughly happy
with the game.

After the fiasco that was AO, it was very nice to bring a new MMORPG home,
install it, fire it up, log in, create a character, experiment with the
interface, and play for 4 hours with never a crash, lag problem, bug, or
complaint.

As far as the fun factor, that has yet to be determined.  God knows I won't
be cancelling my EQ account any time soon, but thus far it certainly seems
that one of these companies finally nailed it.

Best Regards
