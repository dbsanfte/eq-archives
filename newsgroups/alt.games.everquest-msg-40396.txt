That *is* the one I use :) it has all the landmarks I 
need - I just used colored pens to mark in 'up' and 
'down' and 'straight' ramps.  The one I used before 
didn't have *any* markings, didn't tell you which lift 
was where, and the only things marked were a couple of 
guilds.

*Now*, of course, it's fairly easy (unless evil lag 
strikes) to find my way around - the bank, for instance 
is - up the pod lift, straight ahead, to the left.  What 
bugs me more is going from Butcherblock to Halas - I 
HATE EVERFROST.  I still have to just randomly wander 
from landmark to landmark to figure out where I am - and 
i get turned around WAY too often :)
