The word is spelled B-O-Y. You seem to have a lot of trouble with this.

If you are trying to make some sort of idiomatic inference that I believe
verant is incapable of committing error in any fashion...well, there are
people who believe that battlecruiser 3k is the best game ever made.

You and they have the same comprehension of reality.

Nope, but you most definitely imply it. They have done major lump wholesale
changes to the game before, that had precisely nothing to do with any other
game. If your hamster-wheel powered intellect goes back far enough, do you
recall the experience system overhaul? No new games released anywhere near
when that happened.

I suppose that the very concept of how information in the game is gathered
is so far above your head that it needs a telescope to see you. I'll try
and use small words: It is only within the last 6-8 weeks or so that the
top-end guilds on all of the servers have reached the point of killing the
top-end creatures that reside in the north wing of the Temple of Veeshan,
and other similarly difficult areas that were released with the latest
expansion. Since verant can only use models and guestimates for how these
encounters will operate before they actually happen, it has only been very
recently that real-game experience has shown how it really works. It takes
time to see how different guilds do different things. Watching what is
working, what isn't. Creating and parsing the thousands of lines of log
information that goes into breaking down how these battles operate. Then it
takes even more time still to identify what is and is not working, and come
up with a working solution to the problems that have been found.

Let's not forget the rather important part of the letter where they state
they have fundamentally changed how monster resistances operate in the
game. Since this is a core factor that touches on basically every combat,
it requires mob-by-mob adjustments of every NPC in the game.
Bowl me over with a feather at the shock that this might take some time.

It isn't as though the EQ development team has nothing else to do. There
are no typos, stacking bugs, quest bugs, tradeskill bugs, drop table
errors, new spells, new graphics, code optimization, database management,
class balancing, new graphic engines, new races, new classes, new zones,
new continents that they are working on. No, they are FAR too busy taking
fear management courses at the thought of DAoC being released.

>Please try to actually read and rub some braincells together.  k?  thx.

If anyone were to take both of yours, then my tax dollars would have to be
wasted for years keeping you on a ventilator.
