Unless someone is uber-twinked, I'm already going to know whether
to cast a 300 or 600 point heal.   The tank is going to get the 600;
the enchanter the 300 (unless they just got beat to death.)
The Superior Heal (or Remedy) is going to be used on people who
need a heal NOW anyway;  they're going to get a Celestial otherwise.
The Complete Heal is going to be thrown when I know I have to cast it,
not before, not after, regardless of the mana efficiency.   Even at low
levels, the difference between Minor Healing, Light Healing, and
Healing is big enough to be obvious which one to use.   Do I care
that I had to heal and only got 85 HPs?   Probably not, IMO.

It's not like there's so little difference that it's useful to be exact.
Twice the heal is rather obvious;  a heal-over-time is rather obvious;
and a Complete Heal is rather obvious.   So, other than bragging
rights ("wh00t - 3948 HP heal!!"), who cares?

I'm not inherently against the information;  I just don't see what good
it's going to do.
