Actually people are starting to use it a bit.    I was more making the point
that what he is suggesting, holding out for a planar group, in hopes of the
greater expreience per hour, would result in holding out a looooooong time.
Such that often if I had just gone and done an adventure, I would have made
more.

It's incredible exprience up to 54.   At 55, you start hitting a lull.
Around 58'ish, it picked back up to decent, but now highly dependant upon
group average level.

Rhe rate of experience per hour still doesn't come all that close to the mid
and upper tier planes though.   You have to really hit a sweet spot in order
for that to happen.  (Level 61 in an all 65 group, for example.)
