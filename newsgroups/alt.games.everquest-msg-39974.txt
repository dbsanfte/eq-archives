I agree completely . I am only slightly annoyed that after two and a half
years they choose to change something for the worse . I am amused that they
got their knickers in a twist over something that is this inconsequential .
I am also amused because I think the reason verant is doing this is that
they have noticed a recent downward trend, and when I commented on said
downward trend several fine posters spent bandwith trying to convince others
that no such trend existed.
