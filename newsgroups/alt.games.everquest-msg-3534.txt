A) Broadband connection
A.1) Multiple phone lines if you don't wish to handle networking
headaches
B) Router , firewall, or server.(connection splitter)
B.1) Client computers should have win98SE or Win2k,  ME seems unstable
and 95 doesn't make a good client.
C) Obviously multiple licenses and client computers.
