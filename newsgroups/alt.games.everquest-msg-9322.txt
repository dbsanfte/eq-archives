I'm the only enchanter I know that'll jump into a fight and chain-stun.
This is assuming, of course, that I have a lot of mana and not a lot to
spend it on (speed cast a few minutes ago, shaman in the group to slow
critters...).  Oh, I'll also jump into the fight to stun if the primary
target is a caster or beating the crap out of the tanks.  The more mana the
cleric can save for me, the better. <g>

AE stuns are cheap.  I use less than a bubble of mana per minute,
chain-casting.
