I got my smithing all the way up to banded in Qeynos.  Then I went to
freeport and just about died at how much more convenient it was.  In qeynos,
you have to travel to West Karana for some molds and to Erudin for
sharpening stones and ore.  Blech.  At least metal sheets are available in
Qeynos hills.  Of course most of that is available in one zone in freeport.
