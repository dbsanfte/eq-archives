Well, I never sat down and tried to test it, which is why I used that
old reliable weasel word "appears".  I've certainly seen plenty of
roots broken by gimp DD's myself.

SOE has mentioned hidden resist adjustments in the past (actually
boasted probably better word there than mentioned, heh).  And it's
pretty obvious they use them when in LDoN Tak missions Pacify sticks
99% of the time, I hear no complaints about Snare sticking, and I
don't see an unusual number of resist messages for my magic-based DD
proc buff, yet close to half of my stuns are resisted.
