Can't help with the crash (running EQ here on three machines with XP, 
two home, one professional and not seen any problems), but you don't 
need the POP CD's to re-install EQ.

(In fact, if Sony are still doing their free download you don't need any 
CD's, but I can't find a link atm).

Assuming you have broadband you can install the base EQ from your first 
CD's, and once you login with your station name and password, all the 
add-on files will come down when you next patch.  Could take a while - 
but at least it means you don't have to worry about losing everything 
(you still need to backup character related files in your EQ directory 
to keep hotkeys, window layout, etc.)
