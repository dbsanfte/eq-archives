God commanded me to go to church today, not to talk to anyone in an attempt
to befriend them, but largely to continue my education in the Bible which is
incomplete, partially to see what the state of affairs in the Christian
church were in these end times, largely to have some support in the trial
that stands before me.

Well, I was mostly pleased, the message being taught was exactly the one I
needed to hear, I thought the preacher was right on target with his message,
apparently the church services are broadcast around the world.

I did not get the sense that God was present there or either many of the
actual church. The point is that I am a member of the Christian church and I
need someplace to go for support, so I will be going to the Cathedral of
Faith every Sunday for the next 3.5 years, to sit on the floor outside the
main congregation hall is the most suitable place for me so that is where I
will sit. If Jesus himself were to go there surely he would be tossed out
the front door.

The women of my generation are a frozen, barren lot of devils whose mouths
project endless streams of serpents, daggers and maggots, one is more likely
to find a Christian woman in a brothel than in a Christian church but the
odds of that are zero out of any number between zero and infinity.

The women of the next generation which has already started will be pleasing
before the Lord, temperate and wise in all they do, and a great new nation
will be built upon their faith and works.
