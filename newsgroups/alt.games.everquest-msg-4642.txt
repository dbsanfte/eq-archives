*heh* According to what I've been reading (haven't tried yet, myself) you don't
get the bonus from directly eating the stat-raising foods. Instead, you put the
food
into your top-most inventory slot(s). You then get the benefit until the food is

consumed (the "highest positioned" food/drink items are consumed before the
"lower positioned" ones).

Haven't tried it myself, though, so take it with a grain of salt.
