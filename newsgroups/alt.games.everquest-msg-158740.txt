Well, the wizard was only 26, so he didn't have the evac to NK.  And
I'll admit that I don't group with wizards much, not that I shun them or
anything, I just don't see many of them.  So I didn't even think about
an evac.  Next time I group with one, I'll check to see if they have an
evac, before trouble starts.  One question though, would the charmed
ranger have evaced with us?
