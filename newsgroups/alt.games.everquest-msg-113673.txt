At the top wont matter a bit. Deeper it will matter alot. Antonica zones are
coded so that high level uber mob types(thus unmezzable with dazzle) are set
at level 53 plus. In kunark and later this is set at 57+. Deep in the hole
many mobs are random levels 51-54 inclusive or 50-53 inclusive. No longer
will every other or every 4th mob of a certain type atempt to snack on the
chanter who has no defense after a mez attempt that had no chance. Hope that
cleared up any confusion.
