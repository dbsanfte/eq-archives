Wow...being new (since January) to EQ I had no idea of these types of
feelings, opinions, prejudices, etc.  against a Hafling Druid or any other
Druid. Playing my Cleric to 42 (and a shammy to 15 and necro to 9) I never
ran into that sort of stuff. I've read the usual, my class is better than
your class stuff in forums, but have not experienced heavy negative stuff
when playing.  I have a couple of RL friends I play with when I have the
time to join and stay in a group (using my cleric which I enjoy). But, there
are times that they aren't on and I don't have the time to group, then I
wanted something to putz around with solo. As you know and I've learned
Clerics suck at solo.  Everything I've read about soloing classes, points to
a shammy, druid, or necro. I didn't enjoy the shammy or necro that much, so
I thought I would try the druid for my solo, short, non-grouping time.

Ramble:: I didn't take it as Graeme as being smart ass, so no problem there.
My length of time playing per session varies. I've been in pickup groups
where someone joins, and your ready to rock, then 5 minutes later they have
to leave, unbalancing the group. I wont do that to a group. If I don't have
the time that session to join and contribute for a decent length of time,
then I wont.  I enjoy grouping and meeting people, that's why I finally got
EQ. I've played several online games over the years and have always enjoyed
group fighting, exploring, chat, and meeting people from all over the world.

I guess, I still need to ask my question or rather revise it some. IF I was
going to play a Druid, which race, if any, would allow Sneak and Hide to go
above a 50 cap??  I enjoy having those skills. It helps me med in many bad
places, and to sell to merchants that don't like me. But a 50 cap is a pain
to make them kick in.

Again. Thank all of your for any and all help and feed back.
