You won't "still be doing evil" or doing something "actually good"
except subjectively to someone else's point of view. The terms have no
empirically correct value - it's *always* subjective.

Of course, people heavily into certain brands of theology will
disagree with me and DT on that position, which is fine - they're
entitled to their subjective point of view as well :)

>We all have sets of values that we hope match objective good and evil.

As soon as you can identify who defines objective good and evil, let
me know.

>Augh, I'm rambling and making no sense, aren't I?

No, I understand you perfectly. I just don't agree!
