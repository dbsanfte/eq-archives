Levels 51+ really put the "grind" into "grinding it out."  In that regard,
LDoN has been a godsend.  I now look at levels as how many dungeons, instead
of hours, I'll need to ding.  Three to five of us can get together for a
couple of hours and make the xp bar go forward by 12-15% and go about the
rest of our days.  When I look at it, the experience is no better than what
I could do solo, but it's a lot more fun.  I'd love to see more dungeons and
themes in the near future.
