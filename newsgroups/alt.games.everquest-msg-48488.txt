At level 1, fighting the lowest level mobs, they are about an even
match, when you have basically no weapon or combat skills.  I've seen
the first newbie fight take 10 minutes, as the mob barely does enough
damage to keep up with player standing healing, and the player barely
does enough damage to keep ahead of the mob's healing.  Yes, it is
frustrating.

One thing that can help is to put all 5 training points at level 1
into whatever kind of weapon you use.  If you've got a sword, put 5
points into 1 handed slashing.  If you have a club, but 5 points into
1 handed blunt, and so on.  (If you play a class that gets the "taunt"
skill, perhaps put one point in taunt at level 1.  You need to put a
point in to taunt or it will never go up, and you might as well do
that right off the bat so you won't forget).  These 4 or 5 points in
your weapon skill will make a noticable difference at level 1.

You might even put 5 points at level 2 and 5 more at level 3 into your
weapon skill.

Also, learn what mobs help others.  Bats, snakes, and rats will not
assist each other.  You can be whacking away at a bat, and another can
fly by, and it will ignore you.  Beetles and spiders help each other.

For money, make sure to loot everything off your kills and sell to
vendors.  Make a note of which items are worth more (fire beetle eyes,
for example, will get you a couple of silver, which is way more than
most things that newbie mobs drop...and keep an eye out for decayed
skeletons carrying weapons, because those weapons sell for a good
price, especially some of the staffs).

Keep an eye out for higher level players looking to buy things.
Necromancers and shadowknights want to buy stacks of bone chips.
Tailors want to buy stacks of spiderling silks.  Some people buy
batwings, but those are available cheap in unlimited quantity from
vendors, so don't waste a lot of time trying to make money of those.

You will quickly find out that inventory is a problem.  If you don't
want to keep running back to a vendor every few kills, concentrate on
mobs that drop stackable items until you get a container or two.

Tip: in most towns, you can find some NPC to give you a "collect a
bunch of items" quest.  You will usually be giving a container to put
the items in.  You can use that in place of a backpack or box.
Getting some kind of 6 or 8 slot container early really helps.
