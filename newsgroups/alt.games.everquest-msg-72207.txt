Here are the classes as I see them in order of solo ability:

1. Necromancer.
2. Mage.
3. Druid.
4. Shaman.
5. Monk.
6. Shadow Knight.
7. Ranger.
8. Wizard.
9. Bard.
10. Enchanter.
11. Cleric.
12. Paladin.
13. Warrior.
14. Rogue.

I have not reached an opinion on the Beastlord yet
but I think they will probably fall right around the same
as a shaman.

Many classes can greatly increase their solo ability by
the use of potions and Jboots/Tboots/horse.
