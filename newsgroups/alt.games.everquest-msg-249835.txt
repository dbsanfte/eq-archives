They may have written that poorly, but as it is written it does not appear
to be a valid comparison in context with the current discussion.  If they
included cases where the inmate did not do a full life term in the
estimation of the cost of a non-execution case then that is not right.  And
it sure seems like that is exactly what they did because of the quote "..to
the end of incarceration...".  Maybe some in that estimation only did 3
years and that pulled the average down.  What they should do is compare cost
of execution cases to the cost of cases where the inmate spends the rest of
his life in jail.  Only then would we know which is cheaper.
