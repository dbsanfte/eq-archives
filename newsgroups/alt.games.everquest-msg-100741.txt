about $3/month increases and crappy in game service I have one suggestion:
Become a GUIDE!!  Think about it, this is your opportunity to get FREE
everquest AND possible help the in game customer service.  How many of you
have actually worked in customer service?  I have worked at virtually every
level of it from CSR (customer service representative to Call center manager
to director of online support) and realistically (from my experiences)
verant has *decent* customer service, NOT GREAT, not even good, but decent.
Do you know what is so hard about online customer service/support?  There is
no vocal inflection (the mood that comes across in your voice) to show the
consumer that you truly do care and empathize with their problems/concerns.
What may be the best of intentions on the part of the csr (customer service
rep/guide/gm/etc...) may come across completely wrong and after you hit the
send key there is no way to quickly take back what you have said/done.
Could things be done better? probably, will it happen overnight? no way.
What can you do to help the customer service aspect of everquest?  Be A
GUIDE.  How will it benefit you? FREE EVERQUEST!!!  Think about it.
