I guess it wouldn't be too hard to justify from an RP perspective if
Bristlebane were to move the gateway into his domain from time to time, sort
of like the old Burning Woods joke.  Sadly, the zone for the new gateway
would be pretty easy to locate, as it would be the one getting a new patch
that day for no apparent reason.  Maybe there's some kind of workaround for
it  though . . .

More likely, I'll have to go in the way everyone else has.  But I wish it
were otherwise.
