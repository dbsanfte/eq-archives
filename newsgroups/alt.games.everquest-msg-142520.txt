Merit is not at all meaningless. There are groups that almost everyone can
listen to and enjoy. There are also groups that no one ever listens to. Have
you ever heard a song redone by another group and done better? If you judge
what people want by what they buy you are not going to go very wrong:p

My particular passion for music is gaelic. Since country shares some of the
same characteristics I can certainly listen to good country and enjoy it. I
also can listen to good rap, blues, classical, rock and enjoy it even though
its not my favorite type.

I am not really fond of opera in italian however. This in no way harms those
artists as long as some people do listen to, enjoy , and pay for that type.
