If you've sold everything, work on some armor!  :)  Find your local High
Elven smith, some Imbued - Enchanted Full Mithril armor should be fairly
inexpensive and will stand you well until your mid-50s at least.  (If you
can bring some pre-imbued emeralds, blue diamonds, swirling mist, essence of
moonlight, and morning dew, so much the better!)
