Well, from an RPG standpoint, undead are things that used to be alive,
aren't now, but insist on being indecent and wandering around when they
should be quietly decomposing.  Vampires, mummies, zombies, skeletons,
liches, ghosts, and sometimes things like shadows and spectres are undead. 
Summoned beings are critters from, well, somewhere else.  They can include
angels, devas, demons, devils, daemons, elementals of all kinds, genies,
efreet, imps, mephits...  and a few things that can't be, or shouldn't be,
described.  :)  Basically, summoned beings are critters from other planes. 
Undead pets are counted as being summoned in EverQuest, since they are
called into existance with a spell, but wild undead are not summoned.  The
main thing Summoned and Undead have in common, in EverQuest at least, is
that they are unnatural creatures.  The Ward spells are specifically aimed
at them, with the puprose of driving these unnatural horrors back where
they belong.  In Dungeons and Dragons, a few types of creatures can be
considered both Undead and Summoned, mostly icky things native to the
Negative Material and Negative Elemental planes.  Norrath doesn't have any
equivalent to those places (yet) but all pets are considered to be
Summoned, including undead pets.
