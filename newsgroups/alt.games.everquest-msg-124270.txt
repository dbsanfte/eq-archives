 Personally I like that mystique that the zone has. It keeps it less
occupied for the rest of us. I solo there a lot and about 75% of the
time I'm the only one there. Of course, things like a Workers
Sledgemallet (Procs Overthere Gate) make it easier for me to get in and
out of there so I may be biased.
