The regen is pretty insignificant in the end what with items with regen, 
the various regen spells, and, of course, Stoicism/Torpor/Quiescence.  
Stats at the high end are pretty meaningless, as all will eventually have 
them maxxed out, at least the ones that matter.  That leaves only the 
special racial abilities vs penalties.  I'd probably go with the Ogre no 
stun from the front being the biggest adavantage any of the races have.  
Does not hurt that Ogres also get a good start on stamina and hp.  The xp 
penalty for playing Ogre/Troll/Iksar is pretty significant.  In the end, 
as someone else stated, what matters the most is the player not the race 
of the character.
