It seems to be a random effect that can "proc" anytime you're in combat
with the new little bastards.  You should see the text "You feel
rejuvinated" or something similar, I forget the exact wording.  I've seen

human warrior of Erollisi Marr, and an agnostic wood elf that was in dark
elf form at the time).
