I would suggest Unrest and doing yard trash - it is generally easier
to get a group, at least on my server anyway.  On Tallon Zek, Befallen
was lucky to have 2 or 3 people in it anytime I stuck my head in
(pre-patch days admittedly but then haven't things returned to normal
down there?  Thought I saw a post on that earlier....).

Actually, my High Elf cleric faced the same question you pose.  I had
moved over to Antonica when I was lvl 9, hunted around West Commons
until 14 (Nro and Oasis are harder to hunt in on a PvP server I found
as they tend to have darks crawling all over them) and then when I hit
15, after seeing no one in Befallen I moved over to Unrest and stayed
there doing yard trash and Round Room duties until 19.  Could have
stayed much longer I suppose but I was getting bored so I went off to
explore other areas - which is how I ended up in HHK after a few
detours which is where I hang my shingle today as a lvl 24...
