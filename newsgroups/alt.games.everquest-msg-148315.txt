I am testing it.  But they are pretty much through with the testing.  Now it
is just the testers and pre-orders trying to get some levels after the last
wipe so that there is a player infrastructure in place when the game goes
gold in a couple of weeks.  My impression of the game is that it is visually
stunning.  The views are spectacular.  The gameplay sucks, grouping sucks.
But that is not the fault of the developers.  The players are showing to be
less than lazy in most cases.  It is not uncommon to get flooded with group
invites without anyone even asking what you are doing and if you want to
group.  There are some race/class specific abilities in the game that are
severely messed up.  And they will get you banned if you attempt to use
them.  Now as far as something to give you a break from EQ E&B will do that.
There is not much to do though once you hit the mid levels.  It is just
kill,kill,kill grind,grind,grind.
