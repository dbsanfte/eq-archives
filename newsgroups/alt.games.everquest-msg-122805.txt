Well, he happens to be right.  The first spawn after server reset
is varied.  And so are the rest.  "Secondary" spawns have a timer
of five days +/- 12 hours (and, no, it's not either at 4 1/2 days,
5 days, or 5 1/2 days.)

He doesn't.  Why do you find it hard to believe that VI can alter
secondary spawn times when it's obviously proven they can alter
primary spawn times?

Every mob that's now 'random' has a simple, +/- factor from a set
time after server reset.  Ragefire has that same logic for both
its primary spawn and secondary spawns.  Remember that the Skyfire
version of Ragefire is relatively new, unlike any other Kunark or
Velious mob.  It shouldn't be difficult to see that they used the
new, 'random' spawn logic with his spawn or difficult to understand
why, given the fierce competition for the cleric epic along with the
random CoF, etc.

It's a given that the reason for the change to Skyfire from the
old version of Ragefire was to reduce CS headaches.  I can't think
of a better way to create more headaches than have that mob on a
set timer after a kill.  Spawn timers are trivial to figure out;
every guild capable (or which thinks its capable) would be massed
in Skyfire at that spawn time if that was the case.  And that
would be even more of a CS nightmare than the old version.

As far as ShowEQ goes, I don't find it implausible that the actual
"trigger" for Ragefire is going within that spawn window and not
having, say, an Ancient Wurm up.  That's something that can be seen
via ShowEQ and, based on other, known triggers (like the various
cycles in Kunark), something that can be done.  It would be fairly
trivial to insert Ragefire into a 'cycle' in Skyfire after the
minimal time has passed and increase the likelihood of him spawning
every hour until he's guaranteed to spawn near the end of the
window.  (And there's other named in Skyfire where he could go
into the spawn cycle.)
