Yes, and it is my contention that morality evolves in such a way as to
make those things which are bad for a civilization immoral.  Go back
to the European Middle Ages when states had far less control over
their citizenry than they now do and what made people forbear from
killing (when they did forbear) was fear that they would burn in Hell
for their immoroal act, far more so than from fear of the largely
ineffective constabulary.

Ah, but it *used* to be.  Back when nations had too few citizens and
needed to grow.

But morality changes very slowly since it tends to get associated with
religion which is by nature ultra-conservative.  On the subject of
homosexuality though, it *is* changing, although not perhaps fast
enough for some.

It no longer *has* to, although it did at one time.  Nations now have
enough control over their citizens that they can enact laws without
reference to whether the people consider them moral or not.  Enact too
many laws that your citizens consider immoral, though, and I think
it's likely you'll soon have a revolution on your hands.

This one I won't argue, since I happen to agree with you.  I never
said I considered morality perfect, just that I think it's a force for
the most part in the service of a civilization.
