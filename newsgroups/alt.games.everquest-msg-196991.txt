But tier 2 zones aren't "The very best content"

Our (the officers, including me) lack of ability
to keep the guild together as people straggled past
the mid 50's kept me from ever forming guild groups
that could flag me.  I tried with pickup groups, 
but it never worked.  I was willing to put in the
time (massive amounts including all the work I did
to try to get the faster guildmembers to wait until
we had sufficient post 60 folks to flag them) yet
I never made it out of tier 1 zones.  *NEVER*  I
paid for the content, I worked for the ability to
get to tier 2 zones, yet I can't - does that seem 
entirely fair to you?  Yeah, I could have abandoned
my guild, and joined one with the ability to get me
flagged - but so much for your argument of strong 
guild cohesion.  For modestly geared people you need
a solid group of post 60's to get flagged for PoS/PoV.

It gets worse if you (as a guild) are trying to get
your lower level members (late 50's) flagged - you
need 5 VERY strong folks who can carry that person through
the trial.  If we couldn't muster 6 who could do the
trial, how are we going to muster 5 stronger people?
So, instead of contributing to guild cohesion, the 
flagging system as it was established caused guilds to
come apart.  Even if we'd managed to keep things together
and put a 6 person group in who could flag themselves, 
what about all our mid-50's folks, they would have been
stuck in tier one zones, with no way for us to flag them -
causing a rift in the guild.
