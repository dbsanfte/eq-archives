If you were on Xev I'd tell you they were worthless and offer to pick
them up from you. ;-)

As you're not, I'll tell ya. The Drake eggs don't seem to go for much,
but the Dragon Eggs are (among other things) used to combine with water
(brewing skill) to make Dragon Egg Oil. This is needed to create the
treated silk fibres used in the PoTC Blessed Fishing Rod.

The eggs have been selling to me in the bazaar for 100 plat each. Price
gougers who I won't pay have been charging up to 300. Finished dragon
egg oils have been going for 125 or 150. You may want to go set up a
mule and sell them in the bazaar if your'e not doing the PoTC quest.
