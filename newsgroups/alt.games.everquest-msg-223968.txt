When you have your spells memmed, right click on the Spell Book icon.  A
list will come up with several choices, pick Save Spell Set and give it a
name.  Do this for your normal spell sets, I think it limits you to like 8
or 10 sets.  Example, mine are Group Buff, Single Buff, Root Rot, Kiting,
LDoN and General Group Fighting.

To load a spell set, right click on the spell book and selece "Load Spell
Set" then click the one you want to load.

Spell sets can be a lifesaver at times.  Once, I was bound in TD by the
Spirocs and my group was fighting somewhere and I got killed on a pull gone
bad.  I had forgotten to re-bind, and popped in TD and immediately got
trained by a ramp group of many adds.  I started running and kept trying to
drop and mem "Ring of Anywhere But Here", but me without SoW and nekkid at
the time (level 48 I think) I kept getting hit whenever I'd sit and try to
turn to the proper page.  Then I remembered I had Spell Sets.  While
running, I right clicked the book, Load Spell Sets, Root Rot.  My first gems
in that set were SoW, Snare, Root.  I fell to my knees, SoW memmed.  Jumped
up, ran a tad, cast sow, ran and turned and rooted the MOb.  Plenty of time
now to mem a port and get out of harms way.
