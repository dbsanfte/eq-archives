All Beastlord-only nukes (and the Ranger ones as well I believe) were
changed to have an 0.5 second casting time.  This way they don't
interrupt our melee as much.  At one point on Lucy they had 18 second
recast instead of 30 seconds, but that was probably too big an increase
to our overall dps or something.  Either way, it's a good change, but
for slightly different reasons.

Actually, with DoN, practicing is pretty easy...I think Paragon of
Spirit can be cast on any level, so if you have DoN get a high level
Beastlord to cast Paragon on you in the guild hall, where buffs don't
count down.  You'll have 80 mana/tick as long as you stay in there, and
way more if you sit in that spa thing (not sure how much that adds).
Especially for Evocation, if you wait until 30 as a Beastlord you get
the Shaman ice nuke, which has a horrible fizzle rate for us but is
great to practice with because it has a small recast time.  At 34 we
get another (PoP era) 30 second recast nuke, so then if you mix up the
spells you cast to get skillups, you can use both Beastlord-only nukes
and a few others mixed in (Divination and Conjuration especially!) to
get past the long recast time wait.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
