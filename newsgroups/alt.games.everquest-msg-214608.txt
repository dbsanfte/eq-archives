Hi all,

Will you shamans do me a favor and tell me what race you play?  If you
could change to a different race, would ya?  To what?  I'm just
looking for input/ideas.  I don't mean to start a "which race is the
best" type thing.  I know what the answer to that is.  What it is
about the race you play that makes it fun for you.

Also, what is the recommended place to put the starting bonus points?
Twenty-five into WIS and the five into STA?

One more thing?  What sort of stats on your gear do you look for?
WIS?  HP?  AC?

Thanks for all your help guys.
