If you have to unplug it before it turns back on I would say almost
assuredly it's the power supply (or worst case the mother board but
I've only had that happen once with that symptom and I've replaced
lots of power supplies that have failed in the last 20+ years working
on computers. Most times if a mother board fails the computer becomes
a paper weight until the mother board is replaced). 

It most likely isn't the CPU fan if unplugging the computer and
replugging it in fixes the problem. The ones I've had go out you just
had to give the CPU time to cool off before it would turn back on. I'd
check the processor fan to see if has a ball bearing or bronze
bearing. The old fans had a bronze bearing and as the bronze wears out
(the lead in the bronze provides lubrication) it very seldom wears
evenly. If the fan gets offset it will jam. If that happens and the
case is open sometimes you can hear the fan stop.
