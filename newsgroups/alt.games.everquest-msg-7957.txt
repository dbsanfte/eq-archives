Long ago while playing my first EQ character, a rogue, I wanted to get my
archery skill up (this was before rogues got crits with throwing weps).  I
went to NK and kited yellow Beetles with my bow.  Now this was without sow
or snare, mind you.  It took a long time, but I could do it because beetles
are just naturally so slow.

It occured to me, not long ago, that a Ranger should be able to do this
consistantly.  I just made myself a new ranger, outfitted him in some banded
and am working on his archery skill from level one because I want to try
this.  I find it odd that I don't hear more about this technique.  Does it
not work for some reason?

It seems to me that a ranger should be able to snare a yellow mob, even a
low red, and kite it with the best of them using only his bow, reserving
mana to resnare when it expires.  And when the Ranger gets sow, it only gets
better.

Am I on to something or does this not work for some reason?

Best Regards
