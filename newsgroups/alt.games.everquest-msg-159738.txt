As far as I'm aware, there are currently no announced plans for
further expansions. And once again, it has no relationship to the
argument you're apparently attempting to make.

Ah, yes, the old "hint that you have inside knowledge" tactic. That's
been tried here before. It didn't work then, either.

Sorry, the statements are unrelated to one another. But I've noticed
you're prone to that.

Bottom line - as long as EQ is making money and there isn't an EQ2 for
subscribers to go to, Sony isn't going to abandon the game. Business
101. Give it some thought - you could use the exercise.

Obviously, once EQ2 arrives, Sony will want to focus its efforts there
and will encourage players to move, but that's not happening yet.
