I read one that gave some technique to utilize baking to make some plats..

It would work, and if you were broke, it might not be a bad way to go..
Since most baked goods can re-sell to vendor for more than you bought it
for.. I don't recall exactly how it worked, but it was just basically.. get
to 100 in baking, then go to Thurgadin and make some stuff there and sell..

I can't say that it's a better option than the Leather Pads though.. smiths
always need those.. and they aren't easy to find.

The other money making tricks have been nerfed.. One, for instance, was
collecting Ulthork Tusks for a gem quest.. Well I tired this for a day, and
got 1 tusk.. Dunno if it's worth the time, since you could basically farm 4K
worth of Ry'gorr in the time it takes you to get 4 tusks, which equals a
*chance* of getting a uber gem, but mostly resulted in high-end common gem
drops..
