I have to admit I have thought of moving on more than one occasion...I can
afford it, I can afford it for all 3 accounts. In fact everytime I have any
dealing with RoV I feel like making the move but none of my friends will be
there and, although I can afford it, I can't really justify to myself
spending of that much money (120 dollars is about 90 pounds, that is really
only a careless Saturday night) on a computer game.

Out of interest, what are your playing times (and time zone) and when do
these events happen. Being a UK player I often find the most events (Guild
as well as GM) are early ours, ok if I feel like staying online till 6am one
weekend but that isn't often the case.
