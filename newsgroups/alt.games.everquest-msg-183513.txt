From the shadows, the mysterious "James Hicks"
<jhicks@hiddenmail.nyer> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

>    Oh god, I just spent 20 minutes arguing for artificial turf. Ben was
>losing his argument with me

Actually I had already won it. You just weren't experienced enough to
know any better. We all found that out when you couldn't tell the
difference between hundreds of mana worth of spells and then decided
no one could play without KEI.


> until he brought up KEI, damned diversionary
>tactics! In fact, he convincingly lost his argument and everyone has jumped
>on the bandwagon that although I'm dead right, my calling on KEI as evidence
>renders my line of thinking incorrect. Ha! That's what I say to that.

And we've all seen self-declarations of victory before. That and a
quarter will still buy you nothing.


>    Augmentation for haste in your 40's? I've never even *seen* a chanter
>try to pull that crap. God do any of you people play a melee? Do any of you
>actually group?

Your inexperience is once again noted. And I said nothing about using
augmentation over celerity.
