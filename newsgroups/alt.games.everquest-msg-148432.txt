Brewing.  You can make the bottles for that fancy champagne.  And um... 
pottery, since you can lacquer gems for steins.  But that's about it.  
Pick the second tradeskill you -want- to do.

As an enchanter, you're in a unique position... There's really no 
tradeskill that's going to make you really dependent on someone else, so 
you have all the choices open to you.
