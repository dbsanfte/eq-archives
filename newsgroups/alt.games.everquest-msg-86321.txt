And what I forgot to mention is that if she has Luclin installed you can
reduce the amount of memory EQ needs to use by disabling the new Luclin 3d
models as well. For the average EQ'er who is planning on utilising Luclin
you should be looking for a minimum of 512mb RAM.

Of course if you are planning a entire PC upgrade in the near future do not
go spending a huge wad on memory for the present system. The speeds and
types of memory are changing a lot at present and you will be very lucky to
be able to carry forward any memory from a previous sytem.
