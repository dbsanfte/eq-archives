Since I moved to XP last year and and new sound card (SB Live), I haven't 
been able to have the EQ music playing because it would stutter and hang. 
However, last night I went to change some settings, and turned up the music 
just for grins. Low and behold it was actually working. I didn't remember 
seeing a patch that said they had worked out the bugs, so I am wondering if 
in the last couple of patches they fixed a few things. Anyone know??
