FV is a strange server. Most people do not do much RP (or rather do
not take the time to) before the late teens early 20s. This is partly
due to how fast characters level 1-10 now, and the fact that almost
all classes can solo effectively to level 20.This problem is
compounded by the fact that few take the time to learn languages when
rushing through the early levels.

A *LOT* of FV players are completely new to EQ. You will find that
many do not have much of a clue about group dynamics or what role to
play in a dungeon crawl. Especially at the lower levels.

Here are a few suggestions.......
 
1. Take your time. 
FV is a wonderful server to play on. Low population makes it possible
to hunt almost anywhere. Almost all items being droppable makes it
possible to buy/sell/trade items that are not available anywhere else.
The majority of players RP, and it really makes EQ shine. Of all the
servers FV is the best one to sit back and smell the roses on.

2. Learn as many languages as possible.
Don't expect other players to learn your language (unless you are
RP'ing a xenophobic character that refuses to learn the "lesser
languages"..etc.) Take a few boat/nexus port rides, and ask other
players waiting for boats/ports if they would like to trade languages.
Human, Elvish and Dark Elvish will be the most important to start off
with. Ask in the Bazaar as well.

3. RP'ers won't always group with you.
Don't take it personally if someone refuses to group with you for RP
reasons. There is a lot of racial tension in Norrath, and many players
incorporate that into the characters.

Good luck and enjoy the ride. :)
