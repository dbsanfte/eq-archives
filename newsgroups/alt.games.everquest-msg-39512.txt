I prefer to root/dot. My necro is 56 now, and mostly groups. The last time I
soloed was in CS off of wyverns (from 54 to 55, so I could single pull). It
went something like: root, splurt, darkness, wait for hp to go down a
sufficient amount (from lich form), bond of death. Hardly any downtime, and
no pet.

2)  What spells do you have memorized when you group?

Depends on the group, but generally: lifetap, BoD, whatever DoT, shadowbond,
harmshield, feign death, screaming terror, root.
