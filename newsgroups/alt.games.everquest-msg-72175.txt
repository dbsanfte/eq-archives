Got my first point in this today and had to benchmark it.
Heres what I got...

Distance=14000 units
Basic time=470 seconds
Time (lvl 1 speed)=418 seconds

Basic speed=29.78 units/sec
Lvl 1 speed=33.49 units/sec
increase=12%

Presumably lvl 3 speed is 36%, which iirc is slightly faster than
jboots/potions.
With my level 1 speed I can outrun most things. Wolves and lions still catch
me, and presumably hill giants.
Has anyone done any tests on different horses?
From what Ive heard, unless you can afford a top of the line horse, youre
probably wasting your money.
Jboots/tboots/horses(i presume) arnt with you when you are on a cr either...
not like innate skill.
btw im a druid. Still more handy than any of the other skills.
Now im always sowed in dungeons, chromodracs dispel isnt life threatening,
it doesnt matter if i go LD in the middle of TT and wolf form pops...
woohoo.
