Before I finally logged off last night, I stopped by the new merchant
outside the bank in South Qeynos.  His newspaper, The Antonican Times, had
different info in it.... detailed the rise in food prices in Qeynos, and the
safe return of the Elven princess, Fironia Vie, to her father, the Elven
King.

This all seems to confirm earlier posts and websites that speculated about a
super-mega-event in the works and coming soon......
