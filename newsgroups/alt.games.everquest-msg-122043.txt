Silly yes, but hardly "mind-numbingly stupid".  And as for "completely
out of place in a fantasy setting", I am sorry to learn that you lack
any appreciation for "low fantasy".

As for doing him a favor, given that the player is presumably a complete
stranger to you, you are hardly in a position to determine that.

Yes, the violation of the old rule is clear, but the interference with
your enjoyment of the game is difficult to fathom.  Do you use your
cell phone to call in parking and speed limit violations when you are
out driving?  These violations of the rules you agree to when you
acquire a driver's license and license a vehicle are far more serious
than "Ilikepotatos".  I have petitioned several offensive names,

i.e. names that were insulting and/or scatalogical, but I cannot for

the life of me understand why anybody would be so intolerant of simple

silliness.

And yet you would indignantly petition any name that is a descriptive
phrase, or so you have led me to believe.
