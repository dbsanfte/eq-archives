Ok, you're hung up on horses ) You are right though.
100kpp for an item is nuts. The player economy sets its' prices and items
that cost 100kpp might exsist, but that is by general consensus. This is
different. A better way would be a very cheap horse, and I do mean very
cheap, I might even mean free, that grows with you as you grow. And you have
to be able to sell it too, thus enabling folks to train horses and sell them
at prices set by general consensus. I'm thinking one or two horse ranges in
the plains of karana and a few stables around major cities. You go there,
pay a couple of plat, lets say 100pp, and you get yourself a horse of your
choice. You then have to train the horse to obay your commands. At first
it'll just wonder off where ever it pleases. But you will get skill ups in
horseback riding and your horse gets some kind of exp from being used and
becomes faster and stronger.
