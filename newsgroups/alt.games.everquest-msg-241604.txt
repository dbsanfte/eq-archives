This problem interests me, though I don't have it myself.  When they put 
the new sky in, particularly the night time sky, Georg and I looked at 
it and at the same time we said, "That's the sky from Star Wars 
Galaxies."   And it is. It's the same freaking sky.

Why do I bring this up? All though beta, and well into the live version 
of the game, SWG had a horrendous graphic bug which caused the on screen 
graphics to all smear together into an unusable mess every time it 
rained. For some people, the screen stayed that way till the rain ended. 
For others, they crashed. I was in the "stayed smeared" group.

I can't help but wonder if they aren't trying to lift SWG's crappy god 
damned code and paste it on top of the ancient EQ engine?
