I played on Sullon Zek for a while before basically stopping due to
lack of time, and I never could get back into wanting to play on that
server.  It was just too much like hard work on the good team and I
didn't want to play on the others.

How has Luclin affected Sullon-Zek? What team are the Vah Shir mostly
on? Has it changed anything? I've not seen any posts or information on
this yet?

I bet few people have made Vah Shir on SZ as most you can only have
one character on there and most people who already play on there
already have a chartacter and wouldn't want to level all over again.
Or I could be totally wrong.
