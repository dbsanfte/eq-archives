I have to admit to not looking closely at EQ2.

To -me- calling it EQ2 is poor marketing, since it suggests something 
along the lines of Baldur's Gate II, or Might and Magic II, or... well, 
in other words, same world, new engine, bells, whistles... but same 
basic philosophy, races, classes, more or less (hopefully, more, rather 
than less)

Exciting idea when it comes to old school CRPGs, which have a limited 
play life to them, but creates negative conotations to me in the MMOG 
context.

If they want a different setting for EQ, an "EQ 500 years later", I 
don't see what would stop them from doing that, and running it as just 
new servers with a different environment.  Use the same engine, mess 
around with bells and whistles (like they already do with Ledgends, 
Firiona Vie, the various PvP servers, or more radically, Test server). 
That would (with a bit of judicious work in divvying up some of the new 
content) allow people to run with various assortments of the old 
expansions; make it necessary, for example, to have SOL to have Vah Shir 
or access to the new version of Luclin, to have POK for post 60 
characters and access to the new POP, so on and so forth.

I'm not clear (and in part I'm sure thats because I'm not in the 
programming industry, in part because I really haven't looked at what 
EQ2 is supposed to be) what it is about the EQ2 idea that warrents 
making a new game, instead of improving EQ.

These assumptions are purely made up of course but lets say 50% of EQ 
players decide to try EQ2.  25% of them decide they like it and cancel 
their EQ accounts, leaving SOE with the same revenue stream as before. 
10% keep both accounts open, doubling SOE's stream.  15% don't like it, 
also don't like original EQ anymore what with all those people leaving 
and the reduced attention from SOE dragging down interest in EQ1; so you 
lose that stream.  The other 50% of EQ players remain; 25% of them stay 
forever, so you keep that stream.  The other 25%, though, jump ship for 
some Other new MMOG, again because EQ's shrinking player base and 
reduced support means they no longer are infatuated with the game.  New 
players opt for EQ2 because its clearly newer, few people run out and 
pick up the old versions of games once the BGII etc. come out.  But you 
are now talking new players who never tried EQ; can that be as many as 
10% of the EQ population?  Then there's the great hope of EQ2 (IMO) 
which is former EQ players who got disenchanted.  Thats probably as 
large as the entire current EQ pool.  How many will nibble on EQ2, half? 
  And how many will stay?  Half that?  So EQ2 gets an extra 25% there.

If those figures happen to be right, we see EQ at 35% of its preEQ2 
population, EQ2 at 70% of the original EQ population... that means that 
overall, SOE picks up 5% more market share, but at the cost of having to 
develop and maintain two seperate MMOGs at the same time; spending twice 
the money and effort for a 5% boost in income?

IF they'd kept developing EQ instead, I'd guess they'd reduce the losses 
and increase the pickup of new players.  EQ would probably continue to 
slowly shrink on average, depending always on the quality of their 
ability to fix things and develop new things and market the game for new 
players while keeping old players happy.  Lets say they lose 25% of 
their population and get 10% new, recover 5% of the "quit EQ" base.  Net 
10% loss, they are at 90%, and maintaining and developing only one game.

Of course you can argue every one of those numbers, and changing them 
around can result in significantly higher figures... or significantly 
worse ones.

My point, though, is that unless things are radically different than 
what I'm suggesting, it seems to me spending Twice the effort in order 
to get something along the lines of 75% to 150% of the income isn't 
really good business sense.
