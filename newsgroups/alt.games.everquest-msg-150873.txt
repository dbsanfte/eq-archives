No regrets! Would play it again for as long in an instant if I could
go back in time.

Just don't have the will to go through with it anymore. I've worn
every last inch of entertainment out of it. Time to move on.

Problem is, of course, I can't seem to get into any other games
anymore. I think EQ has ruined me. Argh

Still love the newsgroup though. :-p I've always been more addicted to
usenet than to any mmorpg....
