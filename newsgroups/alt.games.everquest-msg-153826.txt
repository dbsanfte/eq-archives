 A Pally is a good choice to Solo as is an SK. People all have opinions on
what you should do in EQ because the game is full of so many self proclaimed
experts. Fact is, if you enjoy the solo path, then stay with what you enjoy.
I managed to solo my SK to 38 before taking groups seriously. I also have a
Necro that I group with, yet people seem to have a problem with pets, so
what's the point.
 The next time someone ask you to group, tell them you prefer to solo. If
they become persistent, Agree to solo but under the condition that you get
1500pp up front, 50pp per Heal, 50pp per buff, and you have first pick to
all drops and loots. One of two things will happen, 1) they will say
nevermind and you can continue to solo, 2) You can group, buff and heal
everyone, pocket the potential 3500k, log and sleep knowing you made some
real loot of some big suckers.
