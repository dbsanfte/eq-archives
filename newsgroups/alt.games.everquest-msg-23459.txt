It really depends on equipment, yeah, a level 21 monk with an Imbued
Fighters Staff is going to outdamage a 21 warrior with a Nathsar GS.

In general, Rogues outdamage other melee classes by virtue of Backstab.
I doubt rangers can outdamage a warrior 35-50, unless they have one of the
highend Ranger only weapons or something like that.  And besides, you still
need a warrior (or paladin, or SK) to take the hits, Rangers just can't do
it, chain AC = crap.
