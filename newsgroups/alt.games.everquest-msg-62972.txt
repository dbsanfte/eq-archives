True... a format and reinstall is the only fix there. I tried 8.0 on this
particular box last month and had to revert back but in the process, DX8
fried the Monster2 card! This box is pretty much my "experimenter" box but
the Monster didn't like DX8 and refuses to work at all in any system now.

I use the ISA modems because they're inexpensive (I live in a VERY
economic-depressed, ex GM town) and are full hardware modems. They connect
well, hold the line well and are fast. IMO, most PCI modems are crap and
just elcheapo winmodems. My choice has always been an external serial modem
but these people can't afford them, so the old Sportsters are the best
option. PCI hardware modems are ridiculously expensive and half of them
don't work any better than a winmodem anyway.

I also have an old ISA Awe 32 and I find the low-end response to be very
impressive and the high-end to be crisp and not crackly or "plastic" like
most PCI sound cards produce.

The problem here is that the people in question have *no idea* what they're
even trying to tell me most of the time. To them, ANY windows error means
the computer is unquestionably dying a horribly expensive death. I get calls
like "my computer died!!" I ask them if they rebooted it, to which they say
"ummm... no..." so they reboot it and all is fine. Just typical windows
users in the worst extreme. I think they'd be lost using AOL! At least *one*
of them knows how to format a floppy! I have to teach one of them how to use
their new CD burner today... this *will* be fun as I'll have to teach them
about directory structure! I might want to find that old bottle of xanax for
*this* lesson!

I have another system check tomorrow where the guy (who has every "computers
for idiots" type book ever printed) can't figure out how to run scandisk in
windows! RTFM!! There is no OS that can withstand this kind of user!!
