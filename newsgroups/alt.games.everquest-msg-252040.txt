The "good old days" are whenever you are a newbie, basically. That can 
only happen once. It won't happen again in EQ2, WoW or any MMORPG you 
ever play again. Sorry.

Me, I'm glad that my newbie days happened when *everybody* was a newbie (
except for the few ex-beta players), but it's a pretty narrow window of 
opportunity.
