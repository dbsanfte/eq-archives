At the time I attempted it with the three mages, only one was level 64 or 
higher, and he did not yet have many of his 63/64 spells, this was 
shortly after PoP release.

Working with level 65s, as I posted elsewhere, I'd feel comfortable with 
one tank, one healer, and the shaman, depending on the equipment.
