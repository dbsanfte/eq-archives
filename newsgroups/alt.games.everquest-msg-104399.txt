Been in Stonebrunt yet?  It's just the other side of the warrens, great
outdoor zone, lots of room for kiting if you like that.  Kobolds near
entrance at doorway and up on hill to right will get you over the hump to 20
or more, then you can go more into the zone and kite pandas and gorillas to
your heart's content.  Have fun
