It really annoys me how web boards (casters realm springs to mind) are full
of two main idiotic arguments:
1) which race is best for X class
2) why class X needs to be nerfed

For example, when trying to read about SK spells for the tiny pearls of
wisdom one can find on the web (my god, somebody posted a STRATEGY this
spell can be used for!) the majority of the posts are either by some paladin
with no life who's constantly calling for SK spells to be nerfed (?) or
someone with no sense of punctuation or spelling yelling that ogres are the
best race for an SK and that all the other races suck on the one hand, and
on the other hand complaining that SK spells are all "useless" and "too
expensive".

It really makes me wonder why these boards aren't moderated, as it gets very
monotonous sorting through 500 posts of the same 3 self conflicting
arguments.

Anyway, its been getting up my nose for some time so I'd like to get this
off my chest:

1) All races in EQ and class/race combos are balanced. This is Verants
perspective which means if one race/class combo has total combined
advantages that significantly make it "better" than another combination, its
only a matter of time before Verant addresses the balance. Ogres make
WONDERFUL tanks, and trolls and iksar have regen which makes soloing that
much less impossible. At the other end of the scale Erudite and Dark Elf
shadowknights get brain cells which come in handy especially later on with
the more powerful spells. In the middle human shadowknights arent as good in
either department but dont have any great weaknesses in any area, and have
some interesting faction. (an innuruuk human shadowknight has access to both
good cities and evil - ie freeport is open yet so is neriak, and most
goody-goody types are dubious, not scowling or threatening).

2) If you play an ogre shadowknight and find that your spells are too
expensive and dont seem to do anything, you might consider raising your
intelligence a little with some items perhaps, and discovering something
wonderful which we brainy races call a "mana pool". This is where you have
some actual mana stored up ready to use for spells. You may also find that
your formerely "useless" spells might become a bit more useful as your spell
skills rise a little faster with some intelligence. Feign death is a fine
example of a handy spell that does require mana to cast and a high skill
level (abjuration) to be good at. Simularly you may find that if you have
some mana and can cast without fizzling constantly, a combination of even
your cheapest "darkness" spell followed by "fear" can save your grind group
many hundreds of hitpoints.

3) if you began as a human or erudite or dark elf shadowknight and found
these combinations to be "weak", plase take a long hard look at the SK
spells 50-65. Particularly 60-65. Up until these higher levels its quite
true that SK's get less powerful spells than other classes. This is a
balance issue, because at the higher levels we get some truly horrific
spells. So if you pick an ogre and mainly treat your sk as a weak warrior,
you will probably find the going easier until these levels, but have less
mana to spend when you get the uber spells, whereas at the other end of the
scale an erudite shadowknight is a particularly weak tank at lower levels
but at the higher levels might quickly find themself with 200 int and a
truly devastating mana pool.

Cheers,
James
