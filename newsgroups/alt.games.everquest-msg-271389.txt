"I'm going to start off my reply with blatant spin-doctoring and
mis-representation of an activity that's commonly viewed as common
courtesy."

It's called trimming the chafe. I'm responding to the post overall and
not going to dissect it point by point like an obsessive child.

You're assuming that the game is plopping us all into some kind of
military by default. It's -NOT-. This is left vague to give us the
freedom to choose this for ourselves. While there are organized
societies, it's up to the individual whether we belong to them or not.
These societies will, however, train freelance adventurers.

If you want to roleplay having a mentor help you along the way, by all
means, find someone who's willing to do that with you. Nobody,
however, is going to be forced into this and it is as it should be.

There's a reason that the quests and such given to level 1 characters
don't involve charging into raid level encounters. We're being given
challenges that we can handle to harden us for the greater challenges
ahead. We're going out into "safe" territory to fight weaker foes and
it's close to home where we can return to the trainers and there are
guards who can bail us out if need be.

There, there's your veterans watching over your shoulder.
