I completely understand where you're coming from.  The mage epic
is about enduring tedium - go to hate and be a mod rod bitch for
100's of hours hoping for the earth staff to drop.  My reaction -
the epic isn't worth that to me, I have little enough time to play
and do things I like - why should I do something boring?

If I could justify the expenditure to myself, and had some assurance
of not being ripped off, I'd probably pick up a high level cleric to
dual comp with my mage and my hunting buddies.
