Completely agreed.

In fact, of the only two people who were ever booted out of our guild... one
of them was for just this.   Word got back to us that he had claimed cobalt
guantlets as an upgrade in a pickup group.   He then took them to EC and
sold them, then went back the next week and tried to claim them again when
they dropped.
