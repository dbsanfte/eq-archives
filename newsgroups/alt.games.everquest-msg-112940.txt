The best race for a monk is either Iksar or Human.

<smart ass /off>

Really, it just depends.  You want faster healing? Play an
iksar, and hope you never have to leave Kunark (which you
don't, BTW).  Want decent faction pretty much anywhere?
Play a human and have fun.

Of course, all monks have a Fungi Tunic as starting equipment
these days...don't they?
;-)
