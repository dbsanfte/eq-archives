You also may want to inquire if your local server has a channel
set up for auctions and the like- I still check it often even when in
 the bazaar (boy talk about lag :-) ) as there are still some good deals
 there. On Fennin ro the channel is /bazaar. And I happen to recall  a
Player named steelclaw there who was selling Rallic Packs pretty cheaply
for a while. You could also check the EQ Traders website
 http://www.eqtraders.com
 as their forums have local topics with player made bags for sale:

 (Hope that wrapped). Happy shopping.
