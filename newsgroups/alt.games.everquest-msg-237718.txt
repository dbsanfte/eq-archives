Yup it was, amazing how much difference a couple of levels makes when
dealing with the mobs up there.

Found our way in easily thanks.

Too right!  We got into the fraudulent chest room and cleared that (PH
chest was up).  Chests particularly were doubling for 350 a pop.  If
slow failed to land we were right on the edge and if they got a lucky
sequence of hits it was very hard for our shammie healer with
incomplete heal to keep up.

Chanters ... I remember them.  Have several people in the guild
bringing them up but none in the right level range ... yet.  Have been
relying on pally pacifies and now starting to use the new monk calms
to split pairs up to level 61 in PoM which has worked great ... so
far.

And if that fails and we get multiple adds ... have a wiz with
evacuate and spell haste.  Going to become more of a problem as we go
on I know 8(

There's a whole load of new PoM guides for each of the sections of PoM
up there now ... just gone up in the last few days.

So far sems like a nice zone for us.  We can't go that far in yet but
as we level it should have a lot of potential.

Thanks for your help Hagen.
