In several states, (Oregon is one, unless it has been, wisely,
repealed) homosexuals are given preferential treatment in the housing
areas, employment areas and under the law...

You hit some loud mouth jerk who insults your wife and you get (most
likely) a misdeamenor assault.

If you hit some loud mouth jerk who insults your wife and he happens
to be gay, then it becomes a federal felony, a hate crime etc etc
etc..

THAT is unequal protection under the law...

There are many more examples but this is sufficient...

Now, about this time, we can move into the area of "Gay.. How we grow
up or how we are born?"
