I was made an admin on a site that i have helped run on and off for 
about the past year, it's not eq related and it's down right now so i 
won't bother with url. We had about 1000 members and it was pop up hell, 
and in order to get "gold" member ship it was almost 2000 bucks for 3 
monthes. We changed our boards but have been having server problems. We 
was also threated by them because we was promoteing people use opera on 
our boards to block all there pop ups so i know 1st hand about 
"ezboards". But thanks for enlightening me about that GU comic, I never 
really ran a monk but even if i did i doubt i would go there.
