We did it without a rogue yesterday, and speaking to my guild it's pretty 
common.  We spent maybe 90 minutes clearing the North wing and waiting for 
The Cryptkeeper or whatever the mob that drops the key is.  I think he 
spawned after we killed two placeholders, not exactly an unbearable wait.  
I can see how if you were a powergroup looking to get maximum exp, it 
could be slightly slow until you got the key to West wing.  At that point, 
you can clear West, then reclear North, then back to West until you got 
the next key.
