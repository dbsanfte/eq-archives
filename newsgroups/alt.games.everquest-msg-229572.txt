Mostly no, they didn't manage, they quit and ran other classes.  The few 
who did manage found niches, such as soloers or burst damage dealers, 
or, as you suggest "pity" or friendship grouping.  There was also a 
larger tendancy to pull, med break, pull, med break, as other classes 
had similar problems.  This wastes the available DPS of the melee 
classes (including pets) though.

Changes to the game balance have redressed this problem to a large 
extent, but a -lot- of that change comes down to KEI and focus items 
(and a mount, outdoors) making it possible for a wizard to do more than 
drop one nuke, then sit till the next mob comes along

No, a level 49 wizard without focus items and KEI and POTC is hardly any 
more effective than one from before those things were commonly 
available, same for a 59 wizard.. admittedly a 64 wizard is more 
effective than 64 wizards predating those tools.. but only because there 
was no such thing as a 64 wizard back then.

Thats precisely the point I was trying to make, the people a wizard is 
competing with are now much more effective, so he too has to be much 
more effective than he used to be.

Splendid
