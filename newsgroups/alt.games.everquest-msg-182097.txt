Well that was nice and noble of you,but what really does it mean?
Elementals are already "ruined" on you're server... what does it matter whos
in there now?

And tell me James, did you're guild cheer because of a genuine desire to see
goodguild_4 succeed, and fight in the same zones/mobs your guild is gearing
up in, or because it means you and them can restrict the mobs/loot that
bad_guild2 and badguild_3 get, by an even greater level now?  You know..
"teach them bastards a lesson for crossing us..."

Thats a guild question.. because im sure you personally may be happy to see
goodguild_4 succeed, but I don't really believe your guild is happy to see
them (if the circumstances were any different)

> (1) No rotation agreement. Kill Rallos every pop, let them whine.

A rotation that restricts their attempts.
Attempts that must meet specific rules, rules which your guild did not have
to abide by
And ultimately, a rotation that slows down the rival guilds progress into
Elementals and beyond

No because then you'd be fucks... and you're better than that

a) you'd be fucks
b) you really dont want to take it to that level.. they don't need skill,
levels or gear to fuck you guys in the exact same way - if you fuck them,
you all lose
c) its grief play.. do it enough and gms will eventually bust your ass for
it

Well I dont think blocking makes you evil.. I think its a way of life in
high-end guilds political bs.  But honestly, what options did you have?

Only the first was a real option, and who'se to say thats not what you guys
tried?  And the first one stopped being an option when RZtW was unable to be
kept perma dead... so really, you had no options.

How long after you first ever killed RZtW did you offer other guilds a
rotation?

They didn't want your rules and rotation either, thats pretty clear!
Offering them bs deals, or rotations in your favour, and then saying "we're
not the assholes, we offered you a sharing deal!" doesn't fly with me

A guild on Prexus used to fuck us when we were learning a mob, they'd lag us
out 20 feet from our target, then pull after we wiped.... use 10 people to
sit in the pulling path and stop us pulling mobs..

Once we finally got it killed without their gimp actions, they asked, begged
and pleaded for rotations.  Maybe we are the assholes for rejecting all
their rotations.. but theres one thing I've learned from it, don't fuck
people over and then ask for rotations to help your own ass.

As I've said in the past, they haven't seen emp, seru, cursed, aten etc
since our #1 kill

FCFS benefits us..  if you want us to rotation (and deliberatly give up
loot), it won't happen after months of griefing us


> > Why make such an agreement at all?
>

The other guild took the moral highground too on server board discussions
(flames)... "well we value our time, we tried to be nice and offer you
rotations!" - sure you offered us rotations, only after you fucked us tho,
and left us with zero trust whatsoever for you, infact left it so we despise
ur ass

> his respect. One of our monks is a moderator for Monkly Business. Shall I

Firstly monkly-bus sold out...  anyway, being a mod there doesn't really
amount to all that much imo.  Somebody else who was mod there, albeit a very
nice guy, was in a guild who used to grief others (not really him
personally.. but hey he knowingly took part in it, and was guilty by
association)

If they know you so well, they'd sympathise with you're situation...  your
having to live in such horrid conditions where rival guilds use 10billion
people to zerg mobs.. if they are friends, like you say furor and your
warriors, then they would know full well the difference between LC-Quell,
and GimpZergs-Quell..  and surely make the distinction clear enough to
whoever they talk to

I know that was a question to jaZZ.. but I'll answer it too:-

I don't for one second doubt your personal motives, or that you'd be a part
of gimping/griefing somebody else out of spite... but for your guild to be
at the top, it has to be ruthless and think of number 1..  be it stopping
the SoD and primal supply, to killing a gateway mob longer than you honestly
need to
