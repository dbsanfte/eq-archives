Recently as last week. I was in GBay /auctioning to buy some stuff and a
guildie was in the spires getting ready to head up to Luclin. I had to
give him something he'd loaned me on the last raid, (piece of resist
gear, not important here). Ran up handed to him, knowing that the spires
were getting ready to fire but thinking I had time to do it.

LOADING... PLEASE WAIT

I'm in the nexus.

No danger, just an inconvenient wait of a few minutes. But it happened.
I had logged on *at* the hill next to the spires and I know for a fact I
didn't have a shard on me. (Had gotten ported to BB and ran there the
day before.) So it still happened as of last patch. (not todays which
crippled my system.)
