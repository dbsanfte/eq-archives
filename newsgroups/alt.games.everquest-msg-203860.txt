    Bringing many, many more people than a given encounter requires assuming
skill on the part of the participants, or chain-ressing the folks you do
have there to throw them at the mob in a mass of lemminglike proportions, is
"zerg".

> How many people do you bring to your raids?

    Whoever is on and willing to come. For some events, like first-time
flags, we have been zerg. Our first Agnarr kill had 110+ people at it,
because he was the last god many people needed to be flagged for the
elemental planes. That was amazingly zerg - I've never seen mobs go down so
fast, nor had I ever seen a raid where my screen froze every time the bard's
AoE mana song pulsed.

> boss mobs?

    Unless you're chain-ressing, deaths don't count towards "zerg". Just
towards style points. ;-)

    I enjoyed it. My enchanter was able to get to a level where she could
make more useful things for me, and was able to do so faster than any other
form of levelling available. That it was doable at my convenience, and
actually made me a fair chunk of change at the same time, was just frosting.

> Big-time roleplay there!

    I don't look for roleplaying in EQ any more, because by and large it
isn't there. You can do it, but the game no longer supports it well. Your
character's choices no longer carry the same weight as they once did.

    The latter. Even though Chastity has done some, um, reckless things
(like running into the middle of the sarnak fortress at level 26 to loot a
Lore item), her personality most matches that of Sir Robin.

    I look at results. The results were awesome. If you'd ever played a
grouping enchanter you'd know that the journey is rarely fun. "DON'T BREAK
THAT MEZ! ASSIST! ARGH!" And Chastity has terrible luck soloing. For
example, I took her from 34 to 35 at the Ancient Crocodile spawn in Upper
Guk, so she could med without the book. The PH for the AC is unique in that
it can be from 2 to 7 regular crocs, all in a row. Since almost all of those
pops would be blue to her, it seemed like a nice, relaxing place to level
up.

    That is, if she'd got the PH's she wanted.

    11 of the 26 spawns she went through were the Ancient Crocodile. My
friend online at the time was splitting himself laughing at me. Incredible
money, yes, but she was there for XP and she couldn't get it to save her
life.

    Unless someone was training the book in GD, you didn't need Invis. You
did need some sort of illusion, though, if you wanted to do it with good
efficiency. Chastity was perfectly suited to do the quest.

    He's right, it will hurt his guild. Raid guilds don't form out of mutual
love, they form to achieve a goal: the big encounters in the endgame. As
soon as people realize that their guild can't get them the endgame prizes in
LDoN (assuming the prizes are big enough to be worth it), their loyalty will
plummet. Heck, I've already started doing a lot of XP grouping that I
normally don't do just to see who would be good to form an "everyday group"
with.
