The point isn't that the will, but that they could. Just look at some of
the broader cases of the DMCA. Leaping to mind is a printer company
suing someone making no-name cartidges for it's printers; by using loose
language in the DMCA, they can do very odd things with the force of law.
The DMCA itself is of very questionable constitutionality, but seems to
be working out just fine. It's better to stop these laws from passing
than to sit back and say 'It will never hold up in court'.

The SDMCA will give cable companies, and by extension media companies,
very broad-reaching rights. For instance, those companies could have
said 'You may not hook up a TiVo/Replay/InsertPVRHere on your cable
line', and had the ability to bring the same force of law on anyone who
did as they do for someone stealing cable or using a descrambler.
Remember VCRs? Cable companies sued Sony to keep them from selling them;
with this law, there would have been no lawsuit. They could have just
said 'No', and anyone who hooked up a VCR would be a felon.

The DMCA and S-DMCA give companies and corporations the powers of law
enforcement agencies, only without things like due process or being
restricted by the consitution.
