Now head to a PvP server and try that. You won't make it TO your
freind alive, much less time to transfer the money. Looting is coin
only on some, coin and inventory on others.Scammers are watched, and
if you did succeed on one trade, for quite a while after anyone
wanting to trade a tome will be carefully watched, and likely quietly
surrounded by guildies of a level that can fight you. As soon as the
trade window opens the second time and the tome of discord is
verified, the crowd will get a guild say of "It's her, kill her."
