I don't begrudge a player's "entitlement" to use the inspect feature.  And I
find it is a useful feature that can be used politely when permission is
asked for first.  I have made no compaint about game features.  There is no
need to put words in my mouth.

As for my explanation as to why I "take it out" on people who use (I would
say mis-use) the feature, I simply choose to give out my favors to certain
people and not give them out to others.  They are my favors to give or
withhold as I wish.  One of the criteria I use is my personal, subjective
view of the person's rudeness.  I find an uninvited inspection to be a rude
behavior.  I do not ask that everyone see it as such.  I do not make any
complaint to either game-designers or to the person who makes the
inspection.  If the person asks for an explanation, I am happy to give it.
I do not get all worked up over it.  I simply play the game as I wish to
play it.  I also have paid my fees and have the "entitlement" to do that.

Do you really believe this?  The perception of rudeness is subjective and
perhaps you can make this statement for yourself.  I use the feature of the
game that allows me to decline invitations to groups with people or to not
respond to requests for buffs.  Yet you consider me rude for using this
feature and posting that I use this feature.  People can use "say" to insult
me or my family.  I might find such behavior rude, but I wouldn't place any
of the blame on the game design that includes a say-function.  If Verant
makes a statement such as "Don't be insulting", it doesn't make the person
who makes the insult any more or less rude.

>  I am sure Verant would have gotten rid of it if it was rude or it had no
use.

I have never heard Verant state that they intend to remove all rudeness from
their game features.  And if they did make such a statement, I wouldn't
necessarily accept Verant's judgements as to what is rude or not rude.  I
disagree with the notion that since Verant has put a feature in the game
that one cannot discern things such as rudeness or politeness by observing
the way people use the feature.

I have never said they are not "entitled" to do it.  You, of course, are
free to make or not make lists as is your wont.  I expect the same.

I am not sure where we disagree.    You seem to be saying that even if it is
annoying, it isn't rude because it is an entitlement.  Yet you also said
that it is all a matter of opinion.  I agree with the view that it is a
matter of subjective opinion.  I agree that Verant lets people people use
the feature and that they are entitled to use the feature.  My subjective
view is that entitlement does not preclude rudeness.  You apparently agree
with that principle, because you have stated that you find me rude, unless
you mean to argue that I am not entitled to my opinion.  I think it is clear
that you do not find uninvited inspections rude and I do.  I have no problem
with that, nor do I find it unreasonable.
