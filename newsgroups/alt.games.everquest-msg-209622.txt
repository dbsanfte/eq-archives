I think it's rude also and I won't group with anyone who does that.
What is even worse is when they start clicking /invite when you're
busy fighting a mob and then will start whacking the mob you're
fighting!  This happened the other day on a character I was playing; I
was fighting a wisp and some idiot level 10 warrior comes up to me
clicking /invite about 3 or 4 times, then starts attacking my wisp!
But the moron wound up getting killed by the wisp and I still got the
experience, fortunately; and he didn't /invite me again after he came
back to loot his corpse! :-)
