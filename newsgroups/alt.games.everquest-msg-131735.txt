HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

my first char ever - i created it on a server which was new and no fun, and
had to have a good way to destroy my pride and joy when i learned of RL
friends playing on other servers

so i tossed my first and most beloved character down The Hole

haha ! i fell, fell some more, thought "oh shit, this is a really really
really long fall, and i'm not going to land in the water after all" - then
zoned, fell a little more, ***PAIN AND SUFFERING hit me for like 790 damage
*** and i took 10k from the fall, all in the same instant

but you say you took pain and suffering damage from south karana ? did 'sk'
mean anything else? i always thought that "pain and suffering" was verant's
not-so-subtle tool for letting you know that you are in a very very wrong
place (my ranger was 9, even though i thought i was a god, being able to
take on up to 5 orc pawns by merely my 6th level)
