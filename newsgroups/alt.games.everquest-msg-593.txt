LOL. I remember some bottom-retentive poster flaming me when I posted
that Verant never made a secret of this and that instead of bitching,
he could just try to *understand* what he reads (or just even *read*).
Being of the bottom-retentive type, he urged me of course to quote the
verses from the Holy Verant itself. I let go, being not prone to obey
to such idiots and fuel a useless thread.

As you say, this should put a definitive end to that argument. I shall
thank you !

Now, this is not intended to be a troll or anything. No need to answer
this post, I guess we got a lot to talk about with that change. But
hey, I just could not help making my point come across to this aemm...
never mind, I even forgot his name. Sorry for the inconvenience.

<END personnal rant block>

On the "comment" side, being a Rogue, I won't complain all this exp
thing :)

Jo.
