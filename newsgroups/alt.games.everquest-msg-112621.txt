oh yoro yoro yoro.. hey doesnt that rhyme with zero? hey speaking of
zeros have you read the game player toll number latley on how many
zeros play ever quest? yeah thats alot of losers, so many people... so
many people that have no life... no yoro i havent played this game
ever-quest, ever-quest screwed me out of $10, i fucking read the damn
box before i bought it, it said (free 30 days) "some restrictions
apply". like no shit, what are the chances of some online game letting
me play for free? i thought surely if i typed in the damn
regerstration numbers it had inside that id be able to play... but did
i? nooooo it insisted on me paying an additional $10 which many of us
dont even have a damn credit card... did it say MUST HAVE A VALID
CREDIT CARD in bold letters on the box? nope... thats there secret
suckerness, thats how they do business... they scam people into
thinking there ganna have a good time.. lousey fuckers... and another
thing... i dont need to go back to school.. as long as you can read my
posts we are just fine... is that all you wise crackers can do is come
up with some chessey line telling me that i have bad grammer? i have
conqured many newsgroups in the past... i was once with webtv and i
have lead a webtv troll group of 13 people, my mission came to a end
after the battle of a certain newsgroup calling themselfes the webtv
mafia... blahhh.. pussys nuked my men with e-mail bombs.. plastered my
men one by one they did... you want action? why play ever-quest?..
theres a vast ocean of alt discuss to conqure! talking off topic is
what trolls do best... so yes.. please respond to my posts... please
do, i love attention.. ive been here for 3 months now, feel the power
of the dark side yoro, join me and together we shall rule the
newsgroups and recruit more (no gay intended)... ha ha ha ha ha
haaaaa...(dark side yoro, dark side!) the end!
