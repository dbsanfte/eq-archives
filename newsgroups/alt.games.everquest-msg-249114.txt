*nod*  The current treasure chest system sucks.    That too would have to
change.

Perhaps I'm biased, but I always found it reprehensible that my rogue with
max skill in Sense Traps, Disarm Traps and Lock Picking was useless in
opening treasure chests, since she only had a *chance* of being successful
on 33% of the chests, and even when she did have a chance, the reward was
still not worth the risk.

That was mostly off the top of my head, just to give a general idea of what
I would have liked to see.   And I am in no way forcing people to bring two
rezers.

Oh please.   Removing the time requirement does not make the dungeons
exactly like other dungeons.

By using them you get instanced content, multiple maps chosen at random,
built in completeable quests with a guarenteed to be useful reward upon
success.   None of that can be gotten in Sol A, Lower Guk or Kael.

Yes.  A don't die requirement, for which the players are rewarded.
Increased risk, increased reward.  Sounds fair to me.

Who said that wouldn't be a good group?    They would have incredible
tanking ability, great crowd control, hastes and mana regeneration, healing,
buffs and a fair amount of damage.   They shouldn't have any problem
following option number 3.  (Don't die.)  Unless they fuck up.  In which
case they *should* fail the mission.


Of course, in the current LDoN structure, such a group wouldn't form in any
event.  The shadowknight would be told to get bent in favor of another DPS
class, and the shaman replaced with another healer since you don't need two
slowers.

The current time requirement does far more to force a specific group
composition than survival concerns.   Any group can survive, if the players
are good.

People would have to accept that sometimes they *will* lose these dungeons.
The current situation was ridiculous when added.   LDoN's were farms.  The
rarity is a mission where you actually come close to losing... and the
points requirements to get the rewards reflect that.

Then do what you do in any normal dungeon.   Rez up and try again.

So basicly you're happy with the current no risk situation.

Carry on then.
