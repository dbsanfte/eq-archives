That *would* be nice.

I've been asking for that one for a long time.  I also
think that "/who GROUP" should override the "anon" flag --
if someone is in your group, you should have the ability
to see their class and level.  Not only is it vital
information for groupmates, not only should joining a
group be a form of "implied consent" (just as it opens
you up to being bound/invised/etc.), but this would
let someone be "un-anon" to their group while still
being anon to buff-beggars and such.

The fastest way to do it is:
   F2
   /whot
   F3
   /whot
   F4
   /whot
    (etc.)

But even then 2-3 people are generally anon, and
you have to flat out ask them anyway.

Actually, that's already in the game:  "/whot", short
for "/whotarget".
