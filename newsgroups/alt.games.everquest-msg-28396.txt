Hackers aren't vandals, although they do break things to find out how
they works. Also note, Bill gates(author of tiny basic) and Steve
Jobs(apple computer) are among the most famous hackers today.

hacker ethic n. 

1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and
that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by
writing open-source code and
facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever
possible. 2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is
ethically OK as long as
the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality. 

Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no means
universally, accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the
hacker ethic in sense 1,
and many act on it by writing and giving away open-source software. A
few go further and assert that all information should be free and any
proprietary control of it
is bad; this is the philosophy behind the GNU project. 

Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of cracking
itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering. But the belief that
`ethical' cracking
excludes destruction at least moderates the behavior of people who see
themselves as `benign' crackers (see also samurai, gray hat). On this
view, it may be one
of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system,
and then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably by email from a superuser
account, exactly how it
was done and how the hole can be plugged -- acting as an unpaid (and
unsolicited) tiger team. 

The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is
that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks,
software, and (where
possible) computing resources with other hackers. Huge cooperative
networks such as Usenet, FidoNet and the Internet itself can function
without central control
because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a sense of
community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.

 hacker

 Hacker is a term used by some to mean "a clever programmer" and by
others, especially journalists or their editors, to mean
 "someone who tries to break into computer systems." 

 1) Eric Raymond, compiler of The New Hacker's Dictionary, defines a
hacker as a clever programmer. A "good hack" is a clever
 solution to a programming problem and "hacking" is the act of doing it.
Raymond lists five possible characteristics that qualify
 one as a hacker, which we paraphrase here: 

      A person who enjoys learning details of a programming language or
system 
      A person who enjoys actually doing the programming rather than
just theorizing about it 
      A person capable of appreciating someone else's hacking 
      A person who picks up programming quickly 
      A person who is an expert at a particular programming language or
system, as in "UNIX hacker" 

 Raymond deprecates the use of this term for someone who attempts to
crack someone else's system or otherwise uses
 programming or expert knowledge to act maliciously. He prefers the term
cracker for this meaning. 

 2) Journalists or their editors almost universally use hacker to mean
someone who attempts to break into computer systems.
 Typically, this kind of hacker would be a proficient programmer or
engineer with sufficient technical knowledge to understand the
 weak points in a security system. For more on this usage, see cracker.
