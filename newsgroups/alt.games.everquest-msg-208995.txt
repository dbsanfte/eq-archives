Hiya,

the reason seems simple : costs for dialups are normally based on time...
while DSL/cable ect are based in volume...

Its crazy that you are kicked because you have used the account ... we know
this behaviour very well in other european countries too ...

But the link you have sent really seems like a slap right in the face ...
one only can hope people thinking about getting EQ will think first about
the named consequences...

I hops you ll find an appropriate ISP soon, see you in game

Christian
