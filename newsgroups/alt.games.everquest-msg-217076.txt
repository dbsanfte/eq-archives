How can you not see?

Its very very very simple

There may be a thousand differences between my normal play style
and yours.

But I'm trying to discuss just one of them.

And you are doing nothing but try to evade that particular issue.

Now you feel that since I've accomodated all your other quirks in
order to isolate the single difference under discussion, there's
no difference left at all?  I've eliminated ALL other differences
but this one single distinction, in order to prevent you trying
to wriggle out by means of those differences.

The difference is simple.  Your group has 50M less than group B. 
At all times.  Until your group dies, or group B gets to FM;
those are the boundary conditions.

I propose that FM is not as bad as wiped, and easier to avoid;
conditions that cause FM don't reach out and surprise you, they
come on gradually and you can see them coming.  Conditions that
cause a wipe are generally sudden and unexpected.

Here, I'll quote myself as you did above, only putting the part
you seem to be blind to in all caps:

You quoted it yourself.  And then replied as though it wasn't
there.  See it now?  Key word is "exception".  Like earlier when
you were apparantly unable to understand the "Given".  A remedial
course in elementary logic may be in order.
