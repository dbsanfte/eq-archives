Ah. So if I return a shirt I just bought that turned out to have a hole in 
it to the store, and I actually take the money back, it follows that I 
stole the money.  Nevermind whether the hole was a factory defect, 
happened in the shop, or I damaged it myself.  I'm suprised to learn that 
the simple act of accepting a refund is enough to prove theft, regardless 
of the circumstances of the actual sale.

Good to know.  Henceforth, I shall inspect my purchases with greater care.

Although, I do suspect you're wrong.  I'll wait for a court or neutral 
arbitrator to decide I was honest or lying or right or wrong about the 
shirt, and then perhaps settle out of court if it can be arranged.
