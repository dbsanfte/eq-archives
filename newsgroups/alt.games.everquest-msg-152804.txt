> Anybody have any other thoughts (or even flames) on this?

Basically I consider wariors balanced . They are not even on the lower end
of balanced. I consider monks and rogues to also be balanced fairly well
right now.

I consider armor class to be broken . Armor should both have a passive
defense aspect and a dammage mitigation factor. The dammage mitigation
factor is broken for upper end characters. Fixing this would fix any and all
perceived problems of the warrior class, as well as catapulting them to the
upper end of balanced instead of middle of the pack.

Balance is harmed by the ridiculous power of clerics but this imbalance
harms all equally so warriors have no reason to bitch about ridiculous
clerics. Just accept that clerics are meant to be the god mode of eq and
plan accordingly.
