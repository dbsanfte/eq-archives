    Thank you for testing my hypothesis. I can never get people to drown
themselves for me - must be the beard. ;-)

    What is the race of the druid, again? ;-)

    I'll add another variable here: race. My Iksar can hold his breath
underwater for a phenomenal amount of time, yet his STA and that of my
warrior are about the same (within 5 points, not across 100).

    Did you get a reading on how fast the "hits" come? I seem to remember
the one time I tested that they come at about four per tick, or one every
one and a half seconds. So you drown in two ticks. But I only ever took the
first one or two hits, being too scared of drowning. ;-)

    Something that people who don't know about drowning in lava find out to
their detriment at their first Eejag fight... Nice work, Dan. If you need
any post-swim resses, don't hesitate to call. ;-) (And note that you can use
res effects after a duel to test the really low-end STA stuff.) Did you ever
give a swimmer a STA buff while swimming to see if it raised the timer, or
slowed it?
