You can speak for yourself, but not for other casual gamers.
Casual gamers like nice equipment, too.  You don't think I'd
like a pair of JBoots for all my characters?

What gives you the impression I'm "foaming at the bit" (what the
hell?) just waiting for a chance to log on and obtain an item/
compete against the camping system?

: That "stuff" in the Bazzar doesn't mean shit to you or anyone else because 
: it's obtainable.

You're spewing bullshit.

*Yawn*
