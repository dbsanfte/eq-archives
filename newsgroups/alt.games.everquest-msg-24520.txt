I have a lvl 42 necro who was very poor till about lvl 30 when Velious came
out and CCE's sold for 900pp+ she won three on one day and from then she got
better stuff.. she is my highest lvl character and i know the feeling... I
worked so hard to buy a crystalline robe when they were 3kp and now i see
lvl 1's wearing them...but I don't let it bother me..
