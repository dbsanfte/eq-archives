Bot'ing is not frowned upon as long as you let groups know in advance. 
Sometimes they will ask you to only play class X in thier group. With a 
ranger you might look at adding a shaman. Ranger is good for finding 
those hard to locate mobs and with shaman slow and bufs can even tank 
most mobs (my rogue can still tank at 55 with 55 shaman, so range should 
be even better).
Or you could go druid or cleric. I would go a healing class since it is 
(at least for me) hard to play 2 tanking classes or two classes that need 
to be active all the time. It is much easier to set up some good macros 
for heals, slows, roots, etc. Plus it makes playing a main a little more 
exciting.

The only problem I have run into is I can usually play my duo more 
efficiently and xp better than I can in a group, unless the group is a 
very good group.

Though I have been in good groups that never knew I bot'ed, I usually 
inform them up front.

Lastly one thing that helped me is one of the programmable keyboard 
devices, I have a group set and a duo set. It is nice to hit one button 
to heal someone in the group without redoing all the hot keys. Same goes 
for assisting and slowing/rooting.
