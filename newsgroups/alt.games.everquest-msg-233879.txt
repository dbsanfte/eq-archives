Yeah, I read this too. The curious thing for me just I'm not a major
programmer in anyway, and I know truly talented people can do just
about anything. But a program that will make your baz bot go get the
lower cost item? Especially if it's automated? It's a little hard to
believe.

Second, It's interesting to note that he/she mentions one web site
"Eqecon.com" as source for information. However, upon going to this
site, it's in beta. So how can they (1) possibly have accurate data
and (2) why would poster use such website for reference.

What I think it is just a marketing tool to get people to go to
Eqecon.com and sign up.

Just my opinion though.
