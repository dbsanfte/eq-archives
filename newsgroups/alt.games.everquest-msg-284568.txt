For the hammer pet to be effective, you need targets which it can still 
hit, and ones which are going to live a significantly long time.  This 
means the smaller your group the more effective it tends to be.  A full 
group which is tearing down mobs as fast as many current exp groups aim 
for, no, not much use.

There's a trick, by the way, if you happen to be root parking adds, when 
mob A is about to die, run over to mob B and let it hit you, then tank 
it till the real tank arrives.  Hammer pet will normally suicide when 
its target dies, but if you've been hit by another mob it will stay 
alive and go after that one.  Of course every mob that it stays alive 
for means cutting the cast cost per target down.  Summoning efficiency 
item will also help with the cost per damage.  At one point I was so 
bored camping the Grimblox ring that I kept one hammer alive long enough 
to kill every goblin in a big loop south of the zone in, long enough to 
use him on a second Grimblox PH.

Quite the contrary, it does add, as you can easily check by taking your 
items off, looking at a spell cast time, putting it on, looking again, 
taking it off and getting a BOR, looking again, and then putting the 
item back on and looking one last time.  Of course the spell has to have 
a sufficiently long cast time for the effect to work, and Cheal is 
immune to the effect... but really every caster and hybrid will benefit 
from a combination of BOR and spell haste.

Sadly, it doesn't reduce recast time, or it would really be significant.

Single fight isn't the issue, though, its kills per hour that are the 
question.  So, if you have enough mana to keep the tank alive for a kill 
every minute, or you can nuke and heal so the mob dies in 30 seconds but 
then have to med up for a minute before you can go again, you've lost 
ground (a minute and a half per kill).  If, on the other hand, you can 
manage that kill in 30 and med back for 15 seconds, you're at a kill per 
45 seconds, and beating the heal only strategy.
