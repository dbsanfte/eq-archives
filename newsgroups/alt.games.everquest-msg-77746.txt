Welcome to Fletching. The arrows I make for fighting with are at the
moment universally 1/150s. Cheap and effectve to get stacks fo arrows for
use. To level up my skill in fletching I believe I'm pushing about 10-15pp
to get a stack of each component, plus the loss in failures (Im at 136
fletch at the mo). The arrows from that making really arent ones to go
fighting with either, just the cheapest to get skill increases...Im not
even onto silver yet.
