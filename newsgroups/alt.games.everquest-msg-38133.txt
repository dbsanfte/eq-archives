It would be be no different .  I reguarly participate in the killing of mobs
far above my level. No one exists who is of any higher level . Some people
have the vision to recognize what is best overall even if it is
significantly later that they are planning on , while others will live hand
to mouth for 70 years . I wonder if you can make the intuitive leap before
it is too late for you, you will have many years to try and grasp the
concept.

I got my stats from observation . You wont have to worry about one of the
things I cited much longer btw.
