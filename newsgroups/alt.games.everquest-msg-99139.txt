I haven't seen it SINCE the patch, but it's happened to me a
few times before. That said, this might be a new bug; did you
have one old line at the top of your buffer, then the 10 from
the end of your current fight, or did you just have the 10? I
always had one line from the top of my buffer when it happened
to me.
