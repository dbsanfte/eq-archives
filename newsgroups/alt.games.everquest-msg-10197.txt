I have never understood this facet of EQ.

Why do casters have to max out skill levels for the primary casting
catagories? There is a built in random fizzle rate on all spells at
all levels, and mobs always have a chance to resist any spell cast on
them.

At level 14 a Druid's max skill level in Conjuration is 75. That means
that he/she will likely succeed 3 out of 4 attemps per cast not
counting random fizzles. 

If you gave that same druid an automatic skill level of 75 when he/she
dinged 14 you would not have a more powerful druid. You would have a
druid that would not have to waste a couple of hours chain casting
summon food/water before they could start hunting with their first
decent DoT spell.

Why should a warrior have to max out Taunt at each level or bind
wounds? How many different ways is there to treat a wound or insult an
enemy? Why should anyone have to work to increase sense heading?
Wouldn't life experience (gaining levels) teach you the lay of the
land or increase your awareness of the world around you?

Skills that should require Practicing:
All Trade Skills
All Weapon SKills
Meditate
Channeling
All Special Attacks and Disciplines
All Class Specific Skills (Mend, Track)

Skills that should NOT require Practicing:
Taunt
Riposte (This should be a natural extension of weapon skill. A better
swordsman will learn how to block and counter attack as his skill
increases)
Disarm(Same as Riposte)
Bind Wound 
Primary Spell Skills (Alt, Abj, Div, Conj, Evo)
Sense Heading

The only reason I can see for dragging out the "skill" process is to
add more playing time to EQ.

Just my $0.02

Cheers
