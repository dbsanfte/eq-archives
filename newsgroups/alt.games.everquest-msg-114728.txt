[Top posting corrected]

Also, the towers have bandits in them. Often, lower level players who
are new to the area will stick their noses in there sightseeing, get
them bitten off, and die on the ramp.  But yes, mobs will follow people
all the way to Highpass if it's a close race. I've run into Broon coming
down the ramp very near the top.
