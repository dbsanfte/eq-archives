 Nope. They're town newspapers. They've got game background info in them, 
but as far as I know, they're not used in any quests. They can also be 
bought off vendors in their respective cities. (Odus Chronicle is found 
in Erudin, The Mining Journal in Kaladim...I believe Da Swamp News is in 
Grobb, but I could be wrong.)
