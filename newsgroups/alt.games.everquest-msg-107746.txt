A charmed mob will head for the bard when the charm breaks. In groups,
I mainly use charm as a way of getting the attention of something
that's decided to bang on a caster. You either get control of it or
you make it more mad at you. Either way's fine with me if it means I
don't end up with a dead cleric.

Otherwise, my experience is that it causes more confusion than
anything else. Announcing a charm doesn't really help because people
are usually missing it in the battle spam and then wondering "Why
can't I hit this goblin?"

More to the point, though, charm doesn't always stop a mob right away.
I've learned the hard way about using /pet back off as the first
command after a charm. I charmed a caster in Mistmoore and it happily
started frying my groupmates while they were powerless to stop it
because it was my pet. I pretty much stick to solo-work where charm is
concerned these days, and even then fear-kiting generally works better
for me.
