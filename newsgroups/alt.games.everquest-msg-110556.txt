EQ IS a big waste of time. Let's keep things in perspective. It is no
more productive than watching television every day. In the end you
have a level 60 character with his/her epic. Woohoo. Great
accomplishment, but what can you do with it?

A brand new game will provide brand new content for all levels. For
that reason, I would think people would RATHER start with a new toon.

As a matter of fact, the more I think about it, the more I get the
feeling that some people are more concerned with losing their "status"
or "superiority" they had with their uber characters.

The factors that make EQ a game I very much enjoy playing are the same
reasons I will run (not walk) to the nearest software store to
purchase EQ2 to start over.

I will concede, however, that I can understand disappointment from
people that did not get to a high enough level to enjoy all that EQ1
has to offer before it goes away. That's not a reason to port their
character though.
