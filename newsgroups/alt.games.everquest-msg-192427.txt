This just in from the Reuters News Service...
There are reports of an attempted thread hijack on the Usenet newsgroup
"alt.games.everquest".  There was an attempt to change the thread enttled
"Help me get an A :)" to a thread using Monty Python dialogue (known as
"Pythonizing").  We have been informed by knowledgeable sources that this is
a newsgroup dedicated to a game that takes place in the fantasy world of
Norrath where Griefing, Killstealing, Camping Named Spawns for days on end
and Trains of mobs are cosidered the norm. (Sounds a bit loopy if you ask
me).

We will keep you informed as to the progress of this hijacking as events
unfold.

Back to our regular programming...
