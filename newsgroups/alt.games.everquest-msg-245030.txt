Last night my 42 Monk in party with 46 WARRIOR and 45 PALADIN on LDON
Collect, High Risk, sustained only a hand full of hits in a 70 minute
adventure.  His base AC is 824 and HP is 1154.  My experience with this MONK
is LDON is exactly the opposite of what you have reported.

Maybe your misfortune is more related to the company you keep on LDON
missions, and how you conduct yourself in battle.

Regards,

Richard.
