Anyone done this? We ran into the boss mob there in the caves last
night, Barducks Darkpaw.  Information on him at allakhazam is sketchy so
far. I understand that his head is required for one of the Qeynos badge
quests, and he drops a couple other things including a ranger sword that
looks ok.  But his death apparently triggers a gnoll invasion of the
town out in the forrest.

That's where the information gets kind of sketchy. I don't see a
reference to specific quests involving this war, but people in the
comments section mention having to keep one of the guards up there alive
during the invasion, and then possibly (?) turning in things that the
invading gnolls drop to him for some rewards.

Any good info on this, such as specifically which NPC(s) you have to
keep alive, what items have to be turned in, and what you get? Anything
for INT casters come of this, or is it all just druid, priest, ranger
crap?

I can probably get two groups of 55 to 60's in there on fairly short
notice if need be, but it would be nice to know what to do with any
drops.
