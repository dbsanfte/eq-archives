Well, yes, what they should say is something like you have to defeat X
bands of gnolls (i.e. encounters) - the way it works now encounters
with multiple opponents are always preferrable because whether you
fight one or five mobs of a given type, the encounter will be pretty
much equally hard even though one gives a fifth as much progress as
the other.
