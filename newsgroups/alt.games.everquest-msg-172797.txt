I have gone back through your posts a ways and I don't see any that
weren't with google. Can you give an example so we can see your
newsserver? I have on occasion posted over a hundred messages in a day
and never been kept from doing so, nor have I heard of anyone being
kept from doing so, except by google (unless they went over bandwidth
limits).
