Yes and no.  It does have some value to newbies, though it's sort of
unfortunate that they can't really do anything except scavenge rotting
loot.  But it's the very fact that it repeats increases its value.

I started play last November, so I first saw the skel armies in the
April anniversary, and didn't even realise they were a recurring event.
I think the lowest skels were green to my main, but the rest were DB
and higher.  As a monk I could hang out a bit more safely than some,
but most of the loot wasn't useful for a pure melee; still, I was very
pleased with the 2HB, and my alts managed to pick up a few of the
caster items.  And sure, I died a few times trying to get to the drops.

When the armies showed up for Halloween, my monk was in his 40s (yeah,
so levelling up isn't my primary goal :-), so I could solo most of the
skels and even got into a group that was knocking out commanders.  I
got the mask drop, and did my share of helping newbies and low alts
get some of the loot.  I found it quite exciting to be able to get into
the fight this time instead of hanging around the sidelines.

That's something I've found in other places in EQ as well: revisiting
an area at different levels or with different characters can be
interesting, because I'm familiar with the mobs and can think more
about how my tactics differ for different characters.
