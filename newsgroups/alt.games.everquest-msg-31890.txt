Well, you kind of made my point ... me playing mostly "on foot" classes.
:-)  I see yours, too, as I've followed the threads on this particular
quest.  Almighty druids and other porters or gaters might have taken up the
quest and gotten more benefit out of it than me, but I'm not so concerned
about what others do and can get away with.  It was just a quest that "made
sense" in terms of the storyline they're trying to write.  As anyone who's
played for awhile knows, though (as it's apparent you have), I mentioned
that quest as only the latest of a long line of quest nerfs -- I could have
chosen any of a number of them.

Yes, and I find myself playing that way, too.  A powerleveller (i.e.  sit
and kill over and over for hours and days on end) I am not.  It would be
nice to have another path for rewards in the game, though.  Makes play more
and more one-dimensional.

An important life lesson, I suppose.  Sadly, you are probably right.   :-)
