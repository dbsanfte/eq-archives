 Well give it merit. The only way I have got AC to spawn (or his spawn cycle
more acurately) is to kill the spawn in the tower and then kill all of the 
same type of mob out in the desert. Once all that type is killed (at any time
of the day or night), the AC/SG/Hussein/Terrorantula cycle will start spawning 
within minutes, AC is just a rare spawn withing that cycle.
 
 I've done this 40 - 50+ times at least. It got routine. In fact I have amazed
quite a few people by successfully spawning AC within 15 minutes for quite a few
people that complained they had "camped" him for weeks without success.
 
 The "kill-the-tower-mob-spawn" "crazy idea" definately works. I've done it
many, many times.
