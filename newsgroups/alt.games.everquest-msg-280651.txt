If a server can support 10K people, that doesnt' mean it has 10K people 
on it.  There were around 50 servers, but it was easy to see that some 
were more crowded than others.  10K isn't a number to conjur with, its a 
"at most" number.  50 servers with 10K people each, though, would still 
be a mere 500K people, yet EQ supposedly peaked out at 2M people.

The merger arguement which suggests that if you take two servers which 
support 10K people each and combine them, then current servers support 
20K people (I know, its not your arguement, I'm being too lazy to go 
back and put this where it belongs) is also incorrect; the servers still 
likely support a maximum of 10K people, but were so depopulated that 
they seemed empty; combining the populations into half as many servers 
mean each has a better population... probably still substantially under 
the 10K limit, as after a 9 month absence I returned to a newly (to me) 
combined server environment which still seems emptier than the previous 
non-combined servers I left.

If the 10K figure is accurate, it must mean active population, not 
causual barely ever playing population.  Even so, the server merge 
suggests that the former figure of less than 500k active subscribers is 
now at best 250K active subscribers... probably substantially fewer.

Of course its also possible that the 10K cap is now substantially 
larger, what with the addition of so many new zones, and of 
instancing... the relative emptiness I'm feeling could in part be due to 
that.  But whether this is the case or not has nothing to do with the 
mergers themselves.
