Same way with languages....though it would be a tragic waste of skill points
and money.....kind of like paying to put skill points into Alcohol
Tolerance.....

Only reason why I know you can put skill pt's past 20 into a language is
that in the early days of Sullon Zek, I tried to be the first person on the
server to master Gnoll so I could teach it to the Good Team.  With no one
else around who knew the language, simply speaking it wouldn't raise my
skill levels in it...I had to go to a trainer and dump skill points into it
each time I leveled.  After some incredibly long sessions /groupspeaking, I
didn't see a single point in it raised.  Couldn't learn it by speaking it
with someone of less skill than I.

At the time, the Goods were the only team on SZ without their own exclusive
language.  (Neuts had Dwarvish & the Evils had several languages that other
teams had to learn the hard way....but all our enemies could always
understand what we were saying.)

(warning: SZ rant ahead!  Those who don't want to hear the "whining" can
tune out now.....)
_____________________________________________
I gave up because:  1) It got expensive, and as a Good, I was dirt poor.  2)
After a while, the situation got so hostile that it became impossible as a
Good to level any further, so I couldn't earn enough skill points to get to
where my Gnollish was understandable enough to be useful.   3) Very, very
few folk on the Good Team seemed interested in learning a secret language
the other two teams didn't already know (they were all too busy trying to
level so we wouldn't be totally wiped out by the Neut's anti-good ethnic
cleansing pogrom -- it wasn't PvP, it was systematic genocide.  Now the Neut
team on SZ wonders why the Goods are so ruthless toward them....duh!)

One good thing about having been a Good on Sullon....while Halas was under
siege, I had enough time on my hands to master Pottery...a new experience
for me :-)  Trouble was, by the time I could make poison vials, all the Good
rogues I had known were already exterminated/driven from the server.

(rant over)
