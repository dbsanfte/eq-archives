Neither.  Your lockup problem (caused by SBLive) is really odd, I haven't
noticed anyone complaining about that...I can't really comment on that
beyond the thought it's time to wipe the hard drive & start from scratch.

As to sound quality, some people say that XP solves it.  Some say it
doesn't.  I'm pessimistic regarding it and am in no rush to get my hopes
crushed by XP. :)  But maybe you'll luck out.

Another sound card?  I've yet to hear of a quality (over $50) sound card
that works in EQ at full acceleration in Win2k.

I'd downgrade to Win98.  As much as I like Win2k/XP (and I do, a lot) I
couldn't take the crappy sound anymore at home and made the switch.
