Blackbird is more acceptable than Duskwalker to me, Im afraid.
Duskwalker sounds like its a try-hard 14 year old trying to get a
spooky twilight motif going on. Of course, its still a damn site
better than some of the stuff out there. Blooddrinker, Fastfists,
Kickshard, Bloodsword, Bloodmist, Bloodblood... ugh.

By themselves, both Dusk and Walker pass. Though Dusk comes off as too
'Cool Action Hero Name' "Hi, my name is Dusk. Jack Dusk. Im a PI. Im
damn good at my job." Just like Blake Steel, or John Stone - it's TOO
action hero. Of course, I have this huge debate with my mates over
stuff like this. They say: "Who gives?" I say: "Why call a character
Joanna Dark? It's so try-hard... why not call her Joanna Quimby? Or
Joanna Fry? Something normal..." They beat me up.

I just prefer names to sound like you could meet them on the street,
rather than like they just stepped off the silver screen (or the badly
written TSR page)
