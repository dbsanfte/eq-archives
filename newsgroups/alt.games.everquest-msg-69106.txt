The problem has to be deeper than that. 

I am not a coder, and do not know specifics.....

It is my understanding that DirectX acts as a middle man between the
game and the hardware in your PC.. Game designers do not have to code
for each specific device (eg Video Card, Sound Card). The game passes
instructions to DirectX, and then DirectX passes instructions to the
device driver. The device driver then passes these instructions to the
device.  That is why you need to have DirectX8 compatible drivers for
your devices, in addition to loading DirectX itself.

Game-->DirectX-->Driver-->Video Card

There must be something in the new graphics code in EQ:SoL that only
works with DX8.1

I fear that in order to ship SoL on time and semi-functional Verant
was forced change thier code to  DX8.1 only instructions at the last
minute. That would explain why SoL requires DX8.1, yet ships with
DX8.0a on the CD. It would further explain why the EQGFX_DX8.DLL files
released on the test server in the weeks leading up to SoL worked with
Win95 and DX8.0a
