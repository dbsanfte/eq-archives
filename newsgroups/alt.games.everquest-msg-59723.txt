    What's the top SHM haste, Alacrity or Celerity? I can never remember.
And do they provide sufficient haste because of how good those spells are,
or because of the high haste on the haste items you carry? 8)

    It doesn't help that pretty much every spider in the open area can be
solo-pulled out of the craziest pile of spiders by level 59. The US camp
(Upper Spiders, the top two levels where the Frenzied and Crystal Fang
spawn) in particular is stupid that way - unless your tanks fall asleep and
allow two or more to pop just at the top of the slippery slide where Fang
spawns, you can have a 59 cleric single pull the entire area with MoK. As I
have. 8)
