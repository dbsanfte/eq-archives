A lot has to do with how your group plans to pull in LDoN. 

Got a group that's gonna pacify pull singles? Pretty much anyone can
tank.

 Gonna use our preferred method of just agro-pulling whatever comes? I
much prefer a plate tank in that situation. You start to see the
downside of ranger/BST tanking when there's 3 or 4 mobs beating on
them at once. They do both make excellent off-tanks in LDoN and I
always love having a ranger or BST along. A DPS class that can offtank
an add is always extremely useful there.

I'm a big fan of having 2 plate tanks on LDoN runs but I prefer having
a knight be the MT (because of the agro issues you mention) and
letting the warrior be the primary off-tank.
