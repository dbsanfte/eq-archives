A word of warning about buying from third parites, which includes ebay
and any other non-retail source you might get the CD from. Be
EXTREMELY CAREFUL with what you are buying! Many of the CDs for sale
I've noticed are OEM. What does OEM mean? It means that they came with
a computer like a Dell or Compaq. ALL OEM FULL VERSION CDS REQUIRE
FORMATTING YOUR HARD DRIVE TO INSTALL THE FIRST TIME! Yes, that's
right. If you have Windows 95, and buy an OEM CD, it will not only NOT
upgrade your 95, it will NOT install until you wipe everything off
your hard drive. Not only that, many of them are optimized for a
certain brand and model of computer. It may not have all the drivers
for your particular machine, or it may install the wrong drivers by
default. Some of them also require CD keys that are generated by the
OEM manufacturer, rather than the keys generated by Microsoft. If it
says 'For distribution only with a new PC' on the front, then what you
are looking at is an OEM CD. While it might work on whoever you got it
from's PC, there is no absolute assurance that it will work on YOUR
PC.

support for 1.5 years.
