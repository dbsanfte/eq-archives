What absolute bullshit.

If you're going to petition every name that falls foul of the rules
because its by nature offensive that means every name that falls
foul of the rules is by nature offensive.

We've already had the name enforcers wheel out "ignorance is no
excuse" several times in the last few weeks, and just because *you*
dont know a brand name does not mean its obscure the world over.
Hell, one of the most prominent "rules are important" (A view to
which I subscribe, as it happens) proponents fo name petitioning
in this group just revealed they dont actually know what the rules
are themselves.

Now, dont get me wrong - I wouldnt petition a name unless it WAS
obviously offensive, by my definition, i.e. "wanna fukuhard" or
somesuch.

This, however, I think would clearly be a case of "those who live
by the sword die by the sword".
