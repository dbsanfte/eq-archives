    When they said they would leapfrog, they were being gimps. Someone's in
VT, you leave them be. End of debate. When you did it to Aten, you were also
being gimps (and fighting Aten with warders up is regarded by many guilds as
an exploit). The difference I see is you, as you pointed out, were just
doing what they had already done to you.

    On my server, it's pretty damn simple. If your guild shows up and my
guild is already there gathering, you tell your guild "VT camped" and move
on. Even with the dissention between guilds, we honour that. We don't honour
any "previous day" stuff, though - if guild A clears to TVK on Day 1, and as
soon as they log on Day 2 they aren't back in VT, then VT is up for grabs.

    I think he was yanking your chain, then. ;-) Unless he's got gear that
isn't in that Magelo profile, and a LOT of it, he has to be behind me.
