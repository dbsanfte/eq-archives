Um, it's going to be different from server to server and moment to moment,
so I hope you were not expecting an absolute answer.

However in my limited experience I have not seen anything along these
lines. Even where it would make role playing sense to not group, such
as dark elf necro and high elf paladin, it is frowned upon to do so. The
reason being that roleplaying is less important than the fact there is
a person behind it.

That said, i'm not above a couple of barbs(*1) in the group if they look like
they can take it :) The class you play, and the skill with which you do
so, is likely to be more important.

Not in my experience. I would also think it would be more of an issue with
SK's and Necro's, who have chosen to be evil, than on a race basis. I've
certainly grouped with lots of trolls, ogres and Iksar.

I'll roleplay a bit, and follow up if someone else seems interested.
I don't expect others to neccessarily roleplay. I don't consider
`roleplay' to be an excuse when someone is being a dickhead and/or
reducing the game for others.

Mind you, if someone wanted to roleplay the fact that they are
`evilspawn the world destroyer and eater of children' I may well
roleplay the element of not wanting to group with them again. It
might seem like a double standard but in this case I am making a
decision based on the player rather than the toon. 

(*1) And I don't mean barbarians..
