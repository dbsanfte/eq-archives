Ok, so major perhaps isn't the word I should have used. How about "playing hours
that, for non-prime time, are major?"

Umm... I think you misunderstand me, here. First, we're assuming that the
players in the continental US are the ones that Sony is worried about, mostly.
So prime time in other parts of the world (for this example) wouldn't factor in.
Second, what I meant above is that, in one (any) particular time zone, say
Central US, more of the people located in that time zone would be playing at
noon, their time, than at 3am, their time. That's a guess, of course, but I'd be
a little surprised if that weren't the case.

That makes perfect sense. Thank you!
