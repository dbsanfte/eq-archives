Wow! What a fascinating discovery!

So, if we assume that say, Civ2 sold a million copies, which is not
unreasonable (actually its very conservative), and maybe 100k people
play it today, that means it has a churn rate of OH MY GOD LIKE 90%!
90% have QUIT THE GAME OMG OMG!

According to the logic of George Dumbass- er, Johnson, Civ2 must be
one of the worst games EVAH!!!!11!1!one!

Those incompetents made the most popular north american mmorpg until
now. Your tastes may not run that way but to deny that is just to
pronounce your ignorance.

This is what happens when clueless idiots get a hold of statistics.
Churn is *fucking meaningless* after three years. People are going to
get tired of a game after a while no matter how good it gets, you
moron.

Whoever came up with the idea that "churn" was something worth
measuring should have their marketting glasses adjusted.

What is remarkable about it? Why should an old game continue to grow
at the same pace? What other games are still growing five years after
they are released? What? None? Really? So the author of that article
really IS clueless? So the playerbase for mmorpgs really ISN'T
infinite? Wow what a concept!

This "professional analyst" knows less about *mmorpgs* than most the
people here. Though he probably does know more than you, since you
seem even more clueless than him.

Of course. But not to the extent you have claimed.

Ah so you are snipping the inherent bias of the author? Figures.

Time for you to go back to your cave, noob.
