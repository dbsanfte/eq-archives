Most of the time when I am using the work "you" in a post the "you" is
intended for the reader. I do not claim to be a litery great or grammatical
expert, quite the opposite really as I am quite aware of the limitations of
my year 10 level education. Sometimes I use "oneself" as well, which I guess
is more correct Englishwise but these days using that tends to generate a
conceited tone, especially in something as informal as a NG. Not as bad as
the Royal "we" of course, but getting there.

Small words are always appreciated. It is also one of my own failings to
embellish my points in overly large words or intricate (and worse:
incorrect) grammer. Small words and liberal amounts of white space always
help to improve readability. Not that I have any right to comment on anyone
elses readability mind you, since my posts would have to among the hardest
to read here at times.
