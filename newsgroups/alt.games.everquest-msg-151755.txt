That's no reason to make matters worse for the convenience of the few.

Of course there will. That doesn't make it ok to make the number of
incompetent people larger than it has to be. I just want a level 40
player to have level 40 experience playing that character.

I can remember it happening several times. Consistent over-pulling,
nuking clerics running out of mana, people who don't know about
assisting the MA, wizzies who continually suffer from premature
nukulation...the list goes on.

It only stands to reason that it would. That's a no-brainer.

Interesting. Still wouldn't like the idea of pre-made characters at
all though.

Um...duh. No one said anything about letting the group get wiped out.
I was talking about being put in the position of having to boot
someone, to be naturally follow by the actual act of booting them.

Again, you assumed I meant that they would be allowed to stay. I never
implied that. They would of course be shown the exit.

Suffice it to say that for /guildinvite, yes, of course. Check them
out thoroughly. For a pickup group? You've gotta be kidding. Seems a
bit pretentious to assume everyone needs checked out before they can
even group with you. You give em a chance with a group invite. It just
sucks when you have to rescend that invite due to incompetence. It
shouldn't be that way.

Their reasoning is obvious (as always). However, I stand by my opinion
that dilluting the game by trivializing the rewards for risk, effort
and dedication can't possibly make for a better game.

Another point - can you imagine what the bottleneck would be to fight
the uber/epic mobs? Everyone thought Ragefire was bad - this would be
much worse on a *much* larger scale.

No. It is definitely a bad idea.
