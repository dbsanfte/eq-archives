Of course not.  Since Barbarians and Trolls don't get it either. :P

Heh.  Actually, I'm not : >

I'm in a semi-small family type guild.  (We may have been up to mid-sized
during our "farm HoT" period, but we've shrunk some since then)  The "Big"
raids that I have been on, up to and including North ToV named,  have been
public raids.  One of the things I love most about being on E'ci, as I can't
really imagine any other server with such an active public raiding scene.

(And no, it's not "wait for someone to kill Aaryonar then take out the
gimps"... we killed Aary ourselves on our first attempt at him ever, then
rampaged through the wing.)

With Natural Durability 3 AA, I gain about 9 hp per stamina point, from my
calculations at Magelo.   I didn't go in game to verify that, but it sounds
about right.

I'm not sure.  I quit the game for the entire Kunark period and half of
Velious.    Played from a week after initial release to October of 99, then
January of 2001 to present. I would submit though, that until mid Kunark or
later (Velious really)  nothing had to be tanked for a significant period of
time, so stunning causing lower attacks and aggro loss over the course of a
fight *wouldn't* be as noticiable.

It's just a pretty big imbalance that pisses me off.   At least give me an
AA that I can purchase to fix it or something.
