I agree wizards are not the best choice for pickup exp groups. This is
because one of their strongest powers, porting and evac, is neutralised
if all the group members start in the same place.

But pickup exp groups are no more or less fun than soloing, which
wizards do rather well.

On the other hand, for a guild  or friends fun/loot group, they are,
along with druids, the business.
Log on, find there is a cleric in Neriak, a chanter in KC, a tank in EC,
a necro in Steamfont and a rogue in Sol B. A wizard can get those people
together and into Tower of Frozen Shadow or Howling Stones within
minutes. And, if stuff goes wrong, they can get them out again. As long
as half the party makes it out alive, there is minimal downtime for
summon corpse, providing everyone carries a coffin.

And, of course, as Sam said, Wizards are pretty good at end game raids
too.
