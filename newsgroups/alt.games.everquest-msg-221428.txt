I decided to max out my swimming yesterday. It was 190 at the time.
Thought I'd let my toon "corner-swim" in the fishing pond in PoK, while I
did some RL stuff.
After app. 1 hour I came back to find my skill hadn't gone up 1 sinlge
point.
Did they nerf the ability to raise swimming skill the easy way, or does it
take forever for those last 10 points?
Left him corner-swimming when I went to work this morning. Should be
interesting to see if 8 hours of constant swimming has done him any good
when I return.
