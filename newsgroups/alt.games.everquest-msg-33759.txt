With Velious installed there is an inventory overlay that appears in
the main view window (at full resolution) when you press I, and so
there is no change in screen size, resolution or anything. It is
semi-transparent, so you can still see what it going on around you
which is nice.

Unfortunately, there is no such system for the spell book, for which
you have the above 2 choices. The thick black band is the better of
two evils IMHO.

Also, the information panels can be customised - you can change the
size of the windows, turn them off completely, move them around etc.
