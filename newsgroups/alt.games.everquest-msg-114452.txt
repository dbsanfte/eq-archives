This is also related to changes in the underlying data in the EQ game.  
This is a huge patch series, and Verant came right out and said that they 
expected to have to patch and re-patch.  This particular re-patch was 
pretty damn important to bards, since the bug basically made bards useless 
as anything other than manapumps.  It's bad enough when they fuck with our 
run song, but ALL instruments and effects, pul-leaze!

Well, considering that the majority of EQ players are in the US, and that 
there appear to be more European than Asian players, it makes sense to 
patch when it will affect the fewest players.  It sucks that it is your 
primetime, but patches aren't usually this frequent.  They have had US 
prime-time patches also, probably in proportion to the population 
distribution.
You could just decide not to live in the middle of fucking nowhere.  
(That's a joke.)
