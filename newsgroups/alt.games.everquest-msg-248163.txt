How do I drag a group-member's corpse?  They gave the command, and I went to
their corpse, but the best I could do was /corpse to move it 50 ft. at a
time.
I have had someone drag my corpse across a zone before and they were running
the whole way. (that is what it looked like on my screen as they were coming
to me, and it didn't take them very long to get to me)

TIA

Ben
