Didn't say any of them were.  I said they were fast, easy to fix, and not
likely to unbalance anything.  They could likely put every single one of
those items in the game in 2 weeks if they wanted to, with little to no risk
and little to no special effort.  I suggested that perhaps this was their
criteria for "address immediately".  If I were a project manager, that's
what I'd do first, the simple easy stuff while I figured out the harder
stuff.  But that's just me.
