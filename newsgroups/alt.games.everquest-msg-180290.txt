OK i think I have it confirmed that what you can't do in this game is pan
the camera around and look at your face. It seems the only way to do this is
by getting close to a wall and changing camera angles. I came from AC and
DAoC where this is possible, as indeed it is possible on many non-online
games, and it feels very restricting not to be able to do it. There's 3
reasons I like to pan the camera around in this way.

1. I like to regularly look at my character's face, to see what they are
wearing, and how they present themselves. This helps me feel closer to my
character

2. When running in a potentially dangerous area I like to be able to pan
left and right to look out for baddies while still moving in a straight line

3. In conversations with people, I like to pan the camera around occassionly
to give a different perspective, similar to what you might see on tv where
the camera will change from being from one person's perspective to the
other's.

If the eq engine doesn't allow it then ok, but i still hate it. Don't you
all?
