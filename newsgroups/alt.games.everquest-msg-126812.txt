Because of the curious nature of the Beastlord pet buff..   No other class
has a buff of this type, so this particular trick cannot be done by any
other class.

Aha, this is where you are wrong.  The beastlord summons a level 5 pet
with his ability, then casts a buff on it that takes it up to a pet appropriate
to his level (for example, a level 9 beastlord spell makes your pet level
10)  When first released, pets would actually say Ding when this buff
was cast on them.

Except if a Beastlord does this.  Then (and only then) the puma is actually
really for ten hours a much higher level puma.  Really.  Check it out.

I wonder if there is some way in a duel or on PVP to turn someone into
an "animal" so you can have the beastlord use this odd little item to
charm them and then level them up.  What would you do if you could
take a character and level it to 50 for 10 hours?
