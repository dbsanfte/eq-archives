    Sang's main is a druid guildlead on a top guild, to give some
background.

    Most of his time will likely be spent in an indoors environment. The
best stuff for raids is there.

    I'd be stunned if he didn't have all resists over 100 and WIS at 250
with everyday gear. After that, what's going to make a real difference in
his ability to survive? 6 HPs per point spent on STA, or the ability to
outrun a train? At present most people I know are putting the first three
points into run speed, so he's not alone.
