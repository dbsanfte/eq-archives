More accurately, what saved them was not bothering to actually have
content that needed testing, and half of what they did have was
actually untested and didn't start to register as problems until after
everyone had branded it the 'Best Launch Evah!' (ie, RvR balance and
major class overbalances and difficiencies).

DAoC's launch is vastly overrated. All it had going for it was
stability. When people got past the shiney entrance, that's when the
problems started.
