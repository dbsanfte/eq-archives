Hi!

I have a big problem right now and need some help.
I've been playing EQ2 for the last week using the free trial and have taken
two chars as far as possible. During the night I installed Desert of Flames
that I've bought and registered it. Now when I start I can see my 2 chars to
the right on teh launch pad but char select is disabled. Also when I start
the game there are no chars to select, only the option to create a new one.
If I go through that process there's only 2 servers to choose from (EU
based) and not the full list that used to be there (I'm playing all mine on
Shadowhaven).

Anyone know what's going on here and possible what I need to do to fix it??

Best Wishes
Thomas
