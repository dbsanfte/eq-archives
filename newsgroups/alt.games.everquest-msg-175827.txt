I'm considering rolling up a warrior, but I have a couple of
reservations. I really like being a tank - keeping aggro,
melee/defensive gear upgrades, weapon skills and so on. However, I'm
wondering if other classes such as Shadow Knights, Paladins, Bards and
such can tank well enough in their own right considering the get many
useful spells and songs.

The one thing I *don't* like about the prospect of being a warrior is
the fact that you have *zero* spells or other supplemental skills to
help you along. No SoW, heals, buffs, nothing. The others I mentioned
do.

So, my question is this. Are warriors *enough* better at maintaining
aggro and absorbing damage than the other plate classes to make it
worth doing without magic and song?
