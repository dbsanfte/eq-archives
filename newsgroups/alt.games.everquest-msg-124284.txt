Some people seem to think killing for sport is okey depending on the number 
of legs of the creature you are killing, and if you eat it afterwards. I 
don't happen to be one of those, so in that particular instance, I'd have to 
agree with you.

But besides that, you picked a fairly easy one... You could have picked rape 
or genocide too, pretty safe. Now, let us not play so safe: For you, is 
abortion always evil, regardless of circumstances? Smoking pot? Homosexual 
sex? Sex out of wedlock? Computer hacking? Do you have also absolute, 
perfectly black-and-white convictions regarding those?
