You dont get bind, and you want a bind ring? Did you misss the patch with
soulbinders, or are soulbinders not sufficient for what you want?
Id say you havnt played your warrior to high level. When you get past 50,
you will be getting rezzed in the main, and you will find getting groups far
easier than a lot of the more "useful" classes. Stick with it.
On a side note, it seems to me that melee's damage output had been going up
and up as better weapons come into play. Nowadays anything less than a pair
of centi shorts is undereqqipped. How much has spell damage gone up?
Nothing.
