Well, I'm not religious, myself, but I do have to say I feel there is a 
conceptual advancement between Old and New Testament. On the whole, 
though, Abrahamic religions do not appear to me as conceptually 
sophisticated as something like, say, Hinayana Buddhism. It's not a 
point I'm willing to get into a big fight over, as I haven't studied 
them in any particular depth.
