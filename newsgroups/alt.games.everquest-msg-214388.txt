    What level is the SK you're twinking? Presumably level 1?

    Crustacean shell stuff drops off the othmirs in cobalt scar, probably
campable by your 60 mage and good fun twink armour for an early SK.

    A FBSS from lower guk would be handy, doing more damage in the early
game makes a huge difference, and I'm told haste starts working from level
one onwards.

    If you can find a jeweler, a few hundred plat should get you a pair of
velium fire wedding rings, would make a huge difference in the early game.

    But the most important part of twinking an SK: The weapon! Nothing else
will get you through the early levels faster than a nasty weapon. Except a
nasty weapon and some great buffs maybe. Or being powerlevelled...

    Looking around there are quite a few weapons around that are droppable,
probably farmable by a level 60 mage and useable by a level 1 SK... you'll
be right up against the damage cap and that's just fine ;)

Cheers,
James
