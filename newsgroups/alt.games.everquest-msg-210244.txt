Something like that.  Though a simple snare is usually enough.  If the 
slower is having problems you can throw a second on, but be prepared to get 
eaten a while longer.  You also have to take into consideration that the 
further a warrior is from the top of the hate list, the harder it is to get 
taunt to succeed.  So there is a happy medium between "enough that the 
slower doesn't get eaten" and "I really wish this warrior would grab aggro 
now..."
