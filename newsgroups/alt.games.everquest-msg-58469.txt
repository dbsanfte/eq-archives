Icetooth's claw. 11/29, though no stats. A damn good weapon that I've
seen going for around 200 to 250. I dual weiled the BAL and Icetooth's
Claw into my late thirties or early forties. Both good choices, and
usable by SK as well as warriors.

Even better is a Kunjar, which I still use. I have no clue what they
would cost, as I never see them for auction. (Got mine on a mob drop in
CoM.) Stats aren't that impressive, but it procs enfulfing darkness
which can be very very nice if you're fighting without a snarer.
