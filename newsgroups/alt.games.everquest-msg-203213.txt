I play a Necro, Cleric, Shaman, Wizard, Beastlord, Paladin, and on the
melee side, a Rogue and a Warrior. I have had KEI only once, cast on my
Cleric while it was in trader mode in bazaar, so it was never used. So,
never had. will never missed it.

During that time, I have grouped with several people with KEI, and their
game play consisted on non-stop nuking. I shudder to think of grouping
with them now!!! My Necro was rolled up as a soloer from day one and as
such mana management was an important lesson learned early on. It is my
decision to rely completely on self buffs, and I accept the
consequences.

<Sarcasm> My one beef is that they nerfed my Luggald Dagger!!!!! I
QUIT!!!! </Sarcasm>
