ROFL

I was going to use that as an example of why losing equipment is a good
idea, not thinking such servers could exist, could job I didn't.
Closest I can think of is Rocket Arena where you start with all but once
dead that's it, no respawn till next game.

We'll just have to differ on our opinions, obviously permanent death would
not work in such a game I just think that DAoC has taken an easy way
out...saying this I understand why they did and in RvR I think that is a far
better idea than a corpse retrieval to another realm for the defeated party.

DHL have my copy of the game so I'll be collecting today, I am looking
forward to trying it and also trying not to be too sceptical, I have a habit
of dismissing things I have heard so much about.

EQ can take a back seat for a couple of days, then I'll have to come back to
get 51 :ï¿½)
