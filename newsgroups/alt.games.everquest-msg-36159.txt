I check my email today and delete the usualy spam and that damn "Snow White"
virus ..

And I see something weird. A message, with no sender, no subject, no body,
but has an attachment.

I check the header of the message. Return path is blank. It doesn't have any
possible way to trace who it's from, as the only headers in there are ones
that my ISP adds.

Anyone?
