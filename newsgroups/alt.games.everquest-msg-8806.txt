..well my BAD experience involves a "good" group with bad player.

Cleric tank
Somso sk (me) Tank puller
Druid tank
paladin healer
bard tank
warrior tank

normally this would be ideal group..but for some reason the two that were
suppose to be heal got caught up in the bashing..and forgot that a red
sabertooth lvl  35 can be quite alot to take without a real heal or...at 50%
health..i say "need a heal"..the paladin backs off and starts healing me....25%
health..i say taunt it off me plz..everyone else is at full health still....10%
i feign death...wack wack wack the cleric it down...wack wack Druid
says"zone"..somehow about that time the warrior gets the taunt after jamming
his button over and over...wack wack...Warrior says need a heal..paladin says
lom..casts...wack wack wack..Warrior get a crit hit(20)...im still laying on
the ground almost laughing now...next thing you know theres a on the
warrior..hes a gonner or sure now..cleric realizes..o i can nuke the
cat...blast..wack wack wack..warrior is next to dying..starts running...cleric
is yeller for help now..bard says "zone"...im still lying on the
ground....warrior is dead...cleric dead...knight is chasing the bard....im
about to 20% health or so...i get up and the cat is about 10% now i whip out
the gun (harm touch) blast for.....YOU gain exp...wooohooo 11/2 blue
alright!!!...now this may have been bad of me to lying there while the group
was getting skinned alive...but i wont loose exp to a group of morons...if they
were playing the way thier class should play..1) we wouldnt have been in
trouble..2)i would have died trying to save my group..
