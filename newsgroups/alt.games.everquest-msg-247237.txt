I would deal with no one who could not take credit cards. It would be
primarily for security reasons . Paypal is NOT a acceptable solution to
hande credit card processing. I would not deal with a merchant who required
the use of paypal. You forfeit your normal credit card protections when
using paypal, other 3rd party intermediaries, or out of country merchants.

If you wish to be able to handle credit cards I suggest you patronize one of
the big box suppliers. I believe that cosco, sams , and BJs all offer you
the ability to handle credit cards at a reasonable rate. If you fail to
offer reasonable customer credit card use, you will probably lose about
2/3rds of your customer base right at the start.
