    Yea, I wish I had done just that when Kunark first came out. I had a
couple high lev chars but I didn't go running into Kunark killing everything
for the new loot like most did, now I'll probably never have a TS like 90%
of the people who ran in quick.

    Then they make the TS drop almost never after the first few weeks and I
see all these lev 10 monks with TS, and a 50+ dr00d p-levelling them. Talk
about annoying.
