/laugh!  Yeah, I loved that.

What I mainly liked about the old Iksar models was that how non-sexually 
dimorphic they were.  Not as bad as the current frogloks, but still fairly 
difficult if you weren't familiar with the race.

That said, I actually like the sleek look of the Luclin female Iksar, and 
the swaying tail animation is keen.  I'm also glad that their standing and 
"ready" poses aren't all prissy (like, um... female Vah Shir), but I 
really, REALLY miss the hunker-down-and-squat sitting style.

Oh, yeah.  And Luclin Iksar in plate?  ROCK.  One of the reasons I switched 
from monk to warrior, sad to say.  ;)
