They vector most of the true newbs to two servers.  The basic newb
zones see steady traffic.  Many of the newbs start out with the
free trial and cannot get to bazaar (or PC), encouraging them to
socialize, much of the socializing occurs in /ooc, word gets around
regularly.

Mind you, I still think the free trial version is an horrible idea,
it is far too sweet a deal for the parasites, find another way to
be nice to newbs.  PC is still heavily used, I'm sure (don't know
for certain as I have avoided it).  But I admit to enjoying seeing
newbs in the newb zones and grouping with newbs for baby LDoN
missions has been a lot of fun so far.  There's plenty of good
mixed in with the bad.
