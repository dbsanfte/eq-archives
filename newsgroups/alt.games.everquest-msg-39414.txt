I doubt it. Or anyway I doubt that's the reason. Since every 3 points of agi =
1 ac, and 35 dex isn't too big a loss, it equals out to be (35/3~11, 18-11=7)
essentially a 7 ac earring. And a FoH member uses one of those (or maybe two, I
can't remember if it's lore or not)...most likely where the poster got the
idea.
