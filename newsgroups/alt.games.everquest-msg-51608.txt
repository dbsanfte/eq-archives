It's not even worth it to buy your rain nukes, really.  And your
shoulder-to-shoulder nukes aren't super useful until 49.

I will happily concede that snare/root kiting is a damned boring way
to kill, but it's also one of the most efficient ways to grind out exp
for a druid.  Things get a bit easier at 29 when you get Immolate.  It
stacks with our Swarm line of DoTs, so it will speed things up
appreciable.  Unfortunately, Immolate is fire based, so you are going
to get considerably more resists on it than the your other DoT.

And also, www.eqdruids.com.  Excellent druid site, even if it hasn't
been updated in a while.

In all fairness, DoT's are the necro's thang, so they are going to get
more.  Druids can't do anything as well as any other caster.  We just
get to do a little bit of almost everything that everybody else can
do.
