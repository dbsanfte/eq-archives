If daddy pays you five bucks an hour to clean the garage, it might be a job,
if he pays you 50 bucks an hour its really 45 bucks worth of charity.

What he's suggesting is that if someone is paying 20pp for a stack of bone
chips, then its not because the guy values the bone chips at 20p, its really
worth 2 pp for the stack and he's paying the other 18 as the same sort of
charity.

Thing is, I think once upon a time that arguement held some water, but these
days, pp isn't worth what it once was, and time is worth more than it used to
be.  Paying 20pp instead of farming the stuff yourself isn't throwing away
money, its saving yourself ten minutes worth of time, and in that ten minutes
you can earn 200pp.

I used this same logic three years ago when doing fine steel for skill ups; I
hired people to make leather paddings for me, supplied them with large sewing
kits and a skinning knife and instructions on how to do the work, and paid
the then unheard of sum of 5pp per padding... because I could log out, log
back in the next day and get tells from people selling me stacks of padding.
I could have gotten the padding myself in a quarter the time it took them to
get it.. but I could do much more in that time than farm green mobs for LQ
pelts and spiderling silks!  And with 5 or six people all farming for me, I
was getting more padding than I would have doing it myself anyway.  It wasn't
charity, it was good common sense.

And I think the current prices on similar trade goods have settled out where
they are because they make sense that way.  Yes, the mobs are green.... but
you still have to chase them around, loot them, repeat repeat repeat... its a
monumental waste of time where you get no exp, no faction, no real loot,
nothing but trivial junk that is only worth having in large quantities.

Well, if the going rate in the bazaar is 20pp a stack, and you pay 20pp per
chip, I suppose it still is.  I just don't see a lot of that going on
anymore.
