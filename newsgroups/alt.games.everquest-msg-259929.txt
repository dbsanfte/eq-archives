giggle...this past feb when I visited a friend in germany, it was 
odd seeing the dubbed american sitcoms playing there...and movies 
also=) The news we watched was very interesting in a comparative 
ethnology sort of way...makes you realize more things are 
changed, the more they are the same...same complaints about 
welfare and housing that we have over here only Chris had to 
translate for me=)  [and I would kill for the grocery store 
selection there...*sigh*]

Though I have to admit, animated movies are neat in the dubbed 
versions because they do the whole soundtrack, not just the 
dialog like they used to, so the songs are done in the language, 
and the vocals all match up, the voice talent also doiing the 
singing. Very nicely done I might add=)
