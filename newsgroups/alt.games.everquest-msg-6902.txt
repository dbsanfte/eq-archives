I started an enchanter the other day, and just to make it interesting,
I made him a High Elf, and I put all his points into Charisma. Without
enhancement she has a 115 charisma. I was looking around online today
and found a place where someone mentioned in passing something about
the best prices at 100 charisma. There were no details, but I was left
with the impression that after 100 charisma, there is no more
advantage in terms of the price that you will get from vendors for
stuff. Is this true? Not that it will make a difference, but I would
like to know anyway. Thanks in advance for any help.
