I have no intention of continuing this thread (which I just found in the 5k
posts I still have to read), as those who refuse to see can't be made to.
The reason I'm replying is because you seem to have misunderstood me,
Willow.  What I'm saying is that the child cannot be blamed for the
circumstances of his or her conception and birth.  I think we're on the same
side in this discussion.

Order of the Mallet

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
