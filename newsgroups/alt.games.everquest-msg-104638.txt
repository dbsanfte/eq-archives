It was my post, Bizbee apparently still has me in his killfile.

Who wants to do the honors and quote this entire post so
that Bizbee will be able to see it and have his question
answered?

Here's the relevant portion of my post:

# >4) ninja looting
#
# From the Rules of Conduct:
#
#   2.  You may not ninjaloot.
#   Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment 
#   from a fallen creature without the express permission of 
#   those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.
#
#   The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand 
#   near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot 
#   that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.
#
# Note that this is a bit different from the usual player
# definition of the term, which usually means someone in
# a group who loots a falling mob so quickly that few other
# group members get a chance to loot it.  I doubt this is
# considered an "offense", since players can easily handle
# the situation themselves by simply booting the rude person
# from the group if they don't share.
