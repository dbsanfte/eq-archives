This is the way I see it, too.  Velious made wizards less important than
they were in the Old World and Kunark.  This is before my time, but I know
it's the case.  As far as I can see, Luclin did nothing major to reverse
that trend.  The question is, will wizards be more important in PoP without
manaburn than they were in Velious with manaburn?  I'm guessing they will,
since Verant has said the focus will be on faster fights (at which wizards
excel with or without manaburn).  Maybe I'm just too much of an optimist,
but I'm happy that way.
