The fact that he has been online for 20+ years is the relevant point.
One wonders how much of the world one could see and learn about in 20+
years of ass siting. Probably an amount equal to that of what social
skills one learns in 20+ years of isolation. Those that believe that the
internet world is a perfect place for those to fit in that don't fit in
the real world don't know that others can see through them. No matter
how hard you try to hide a nerd and a fatass it still comes out even on
the net.
