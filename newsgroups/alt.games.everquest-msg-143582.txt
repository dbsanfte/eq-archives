I found that occassionally barking 'healer loot!' (or more often
'casters loot!') worked pretty well in groups that weren't afflicted
with a "kneeler".  It gradually became a non-issue above L30, pp drops
were usually crap and other stuff was shared/randomed around the whole
group.  Best is always master-loot tho, especially if you have a trusted
druid or wizard who can port out to sell the vendor crap and gate back
to split with the group, missing maybe one or two kills.
