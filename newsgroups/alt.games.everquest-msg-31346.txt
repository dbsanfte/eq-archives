Me too, if you know of any, let me know.

Note:  The presidency isn't one of them.  Apparently you've
missed the AP stories on how much work Bush is doing on his
so-called "vacations", including (this time around) having
meetings to hammer down immigration policy, a position
on stem cell research, whether to remove the head of
the CPSC, and a state visit with the President
of Mexico, not to mention daily national
security briefings and policy discussions (especially
concerning Iraq and Macedonia), having press
conferences, and a day spent building a house with 
Habitat for Humanity (in Texas summer heat, nonetheless).

Anyone who believes that Presidents take actual "vacations"
instead of what busy business men call "working vacations"
is a moron.

Even the New York Times (which can usually be counted on
for over-the-top Bush-bashing) wrote:

   CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug. 6 ï¿½ President Bush may be on 
   vacation, but it's work, work, work. The Middle East. 
   Stem-cell research. Global warming. Heavy topics all, to 
   which the president is diligently applying himself, even 
   as the mercury here pushes past 100 and the rest of the 
   country kicks back.
     [snip]
   For many, August is a chance to chill from the daily 
   grind. But for Mr. Bush, this is a "working vacation," in 
   which he will work to overhaul his image and send some 
   deliberate signals. He is on vacation, yes, but not 
   from work. Just from Washington.

As Bush himself said in today's news conference:

    Q Some of these folks say you're -- when you're 
    in Texas.  You're taking too long of a vacation. 

    THE PRESIDENT: They don't understand the definition 
    of work, then. I'm getting a lot done. Secondly, you 
    don't have to be in Washington to work. It's amazing 
    what can happen with telephones and faxes. 

Lots of people get their jollies trying to paint Bush as
stupid, but here he gets to fire a return shot, at those
who are dim enough to think that it's not possible to
do the work of the Presidency from somewhere in Texas.

And Congress is in recess for August anyway, August
is traditionally a time for Presidents to kick back a
bit, since the political landscape is so quiet.

This whole "43% of his time on vacation" nonsense came from
the Washington Post (oh, now *there's* an unbiased observer...)
and has been parroted by every partisan in sight as if it
were somehow significant, rather than the silly political
bit of fluff that it is.

What's *really* honking off the Washington Post may be
the fact that in order to follow the continuing work of
the President (yes, *work*, their reporters have to
hang out in a small Texas town in August, instead of
their favorite Washington bars, or a more traditionally
cushy Presidential retreat.

And I notice that they didn't bother tallying Clinton's
record-breaking time spent globe-trotting as "vacationing",
even when they consisted of quick meetings with whatever
national head was in the neighborhood, followed by a
lot of sightseeing with his family and his entourage
of hundreds of "aids" who just happened to have a pressing
need to visit the Taj Mahal.  At least Bush's "vacations"
to his own ranch don't cost the taxpayers as much as 
Clinton's massive world-traveling junkets did.
