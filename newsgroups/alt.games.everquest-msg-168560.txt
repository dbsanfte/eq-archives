Turn SOL graphic for human off, leave Horse Graphic on.

Invisible is the very best look for a horse.  And its SOOOO much more
functional not having the irritating horse  movement and horse graphic
blocking your view as you work.  If its better for a cleric (who can do a lot
of targetting via f2-f6 and assists) its got to be much much better for an
enchanter
