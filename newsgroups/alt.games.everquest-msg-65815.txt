I think it's the noises that affect me the most ...

I live on a busy street, so it's always noisy anyway.  But many times
I won't even be logged on to EQ and I think I hear Gnolls, Orcs, or
whatever.  Or people running down the sidewalk sound like PC's running
by in the game.  

I might be doing the dishes or something and I think I hear some orc
"talking" and run to my computer to discover that EQ isn't even on ...

Weird.

I wish I could Gate in real life ...

The same goddamned panhandler asking for money again?  Just tell him
that "You have become better at begging! (1)".

I also had a bunch of change in my pocket and on my desk that was
building up and I thought I had to go to the bank to "ATM" it; I
forgot that I could also spend it without having to wait for a better
item.

Also, did anyone notice that one of the new female models for some
race (Half-elves, maybe, forgot!) all look like Barbra Streisand, no
matter how much you change the hair, etc?  Maybe she got a cut of the
loot ...
