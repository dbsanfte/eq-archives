Root/DoT is the way to take on giants. Cyclops and Giants are tricky
though. I never had much luck with them until they were blue to me.
They resist a lot. With Giants you will think you are kiting, because
you will have to snare/run/root---resist---/run/root/etc. They have a
ton of HPs so the only effective way of killing them is to DoT while
they are rooted. That way your DoTs will do full damage. Also if you
have a spell slot open toss in your level 1 Flame Lick spell. It will
stop the natural HP regen on the mobs you are fighting. That way when
root breaks and the DoTs wear off. they do not regen while you are
running and re-rooting.

Cheers
