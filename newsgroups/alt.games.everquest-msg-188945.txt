I have a friend who has spent 7 months in KC at 59. He just dinged 60.

That is the single reason you should get pop. It's not like it is expensive.

56 is commendable, but you in no way have "won" or "finished" EQ as a game,
you have just decided you aren't interested in what comes after. Having just
recently dinged 65, I can tell you there are world of experiences (not
meaning XP, just sights and adventures) beyond anything you can see at level
56. You have only just acquired the ability to Complete Heal, and have yet
to learn how to use it in combination with faster and different types of
heals to group in places where the tank is taking hundreds of damage per
second, if not thousands.

That said, if SWG is for you, there probably won't be any turning back, but
everyone I joined SWG beta with is back to playing EQ and most have removed
SWG beta from their systems.

PB
