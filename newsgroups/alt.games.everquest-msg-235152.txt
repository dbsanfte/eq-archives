Joerg,

It's entirely possible for a bard to solo from level 1 to level 65.  It's
not even difficult, really, just takes time - and not that much of it.
Certainly less than for most other classes; I'd say druids and necromancers
are the only classes that can solo faster/better.

That being said - it won't make you much of a bard.  See my thread in this
newsgroup about 'sucky ldon groups;' what we have in there is a good example
of a solo-only bard - he had no idea how to do anything to interact with the
members of his group, and everyone suffered for it, including the bard.

If you're mathematically inclined, you can think of bards (and enchanters,
for that matter) as group multipliers.  A generic bard adds himself to the
group but doesn't add much else - group x 1 = group.  A good bard makes
everyone in the group more effective - group x 1.5= 1.5group, one and a half
times as effective as before the bard.  A bad bard reduces the efficiency of
the group - group x .6 = .6group as they scramble to recover from a bard's
screwups.

You can solo a bard to 65 - but what will you do with a high-level bard with
no grouping or raiding skills?  I've seen a poorly-played bard wipe an
entire raid all by himself - it's amazingly easy.  Heck, just pulse Chorus
of Marr once while a monk is trying to split a pull in a tough area
(happened to me in NTOV) and it's all over.

Soulfrost,
65 Enchanter
