Ok, perhaps unnecessary is the wrong word, although I'd argue it is still 
necessary for some folks to commute.  There was no benefit to be gained by 
making everyone who signed up take that risk.  Even joyriding would count 
as a benefit.

}You weren't forced to. You always had the option of not signing up.

Sigh, ok, I'll spell it out for you. "But I do resent having been forced 
to, in order to sign up for the beta. But I think it was rude of Sony to 
require that in order to sign up for the beta."  Better?
