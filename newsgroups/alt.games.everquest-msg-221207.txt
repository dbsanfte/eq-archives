There are more than a few people who differ with part or all of that
opinion.  Hybrid agro has always been there, hell Rangers were given
a spell line to compensate for it by reducing the mobs' hate as part
of the big round of melee balancing!  The main reason hybrid agro has
become a class balance issue is that the caster sustained DPS increase
has made their damage output more often agro-limited than mana-limited.
This has been complemented by (1) the general erosion of the Warrior's
tanking advantage (Rangers and even Beastlords can tank a lot of the
XP content these days due to the general HP inflation, consider what
that implies about knights), (2) the existence of mobs that can one-
round casters in popular XP zones (PoP), and (3) (final nail in the
coffin) content that substantially increases the reward for killing
mobs quickly (LDoN).

You do realize that you are proposing turning Paladins into Rangers
with one-third the DPS (and no ability to stand off and deliver that
puny DPS from range besides), right?  Oh, you can fix that by nerfing
Rangers, and then Beastlords, and then...
As things are casters would happily use a rag doll to tank if it could
hold agro.  Of course, they don't have to, they can use mage pets that
outdamage Paladins or charmed pets and just forgo the irritation of
grouping with any melee classes.
Fix Warriors!  Breaking knights fixes nothing.

Here's the rub:  whatever solution you come up with you have to get
the player base to buy into it.  It took the players well over a year
to realize that knights were could tank.  Were it not for the inertia
of the fashion slaves who (apparently) make up most of the player
base this issue would have come to a head well over a year ago (it
took content changes to get people to try new tactics on a large
enough scale to reveal how thoroughly SOE had screwed Warriors).

You are most probably wrong about that.  Most EQ players seem to be
unimaginative slaves to fashion, I'd be willing to bet that most of
them routinely wear clothing bearing prominent logos.  I expect that
if SOE actually manages to put in a good fix that it won't work.  EQ
players overall are so afraid of doing anything new and different
that they just don't until they've been unhappy with the status quo
for a long time (assuming that status quo was good to them for a
while, ring the bell for a biscuit and all that).

OTOH, there's no chance of fixing things if they don't try, so I'll
hope for the best even though I expect the worst.
