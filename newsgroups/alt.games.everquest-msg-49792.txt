Some Newbie questions....plz help
What is the difference between all of the servers that you can choose from?
Are the servers all the same environment just with different people playing
on each one? Is each server a different adventure you can go on? Do you have
to go back to the same server each time you want to resume playing your
current quest? I noticed that there are two different categories to chose
from, what is the difference between them? If anyone could help it would be
much appreciated...........thanx and sorry for so many ?'s
