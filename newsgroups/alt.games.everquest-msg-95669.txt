The only animals I know of in WW are Velium Hounds and Brontotherium.  
That's two mobs out of about 60 different mobs there.  WW if full of 
wanderers.  I can sometimes kite there, but when kiting you control where 
the mob paths, with fear you hope you guess right.  I don't like guessing 
when I'm in an area surrounded by mobs that range from 50-65.  I've done 
it, but it's rather frightening.

Yeah, it's busy prime-time, just like any other zone.  Where do rangers go 
to solo at 8pm EST?  I'm sure the well-known ranger kiting zones get 
pretty crowded then too, or do rangers get faster EXP in a good group?

We are on a slightly lower damage table, but we're closer now than we used 
to be.  Bards get duel-weild, knights get double attack.  The thing is 
that knights generally get very nice ratio weapons (slow, but nice ratio) 
and they get the primary hand bonus every time they swing.  Bards can get 
very fast weapons in the primary hand, but the ratios aren't as good, and 
we only get the bonus in our main hand, so we lose out a bit there.
I would *strongly* suspect that I can outdamage most level 60 knights with 
only self-buffs though.  I can get 40% spell haste from clicky lute, 
boosted to 55% haste from my epic proc, plus an additional 15% haste from 
my overhaste song (stacks with all song/spell hastes), plus my item haste, 
which puts me at about 97% haste, not quite the cap.  When I get my level 
60 overhaste upgrade, I can hit 107% haste self-buffed.  In addition I can 
get my ATK over 1250 self-buffed.  
Bards are not melee powerhouses, but we do decent melee damage.  We have 
the ability to self-buff ourselves very, very well at the end-game, and if 
I could even figure out the correct order to get howler, epic, overhaste, 
and 57 buff song to all stack, I could probably break 1300ATK, 1200AC and 
105% haste with what I have now.  No, it's not uber, I'm not going to be 
keeping a monk or a rogue from getting a group, but it's decent damage and 
works pretty well.

tried really hard to not take aggro from the warriors last night
