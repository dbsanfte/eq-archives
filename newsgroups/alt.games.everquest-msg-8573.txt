Erm, at Ruby Ridge, the people inside had not actually done anything wrong,
they just so happened to be isolationists with lots of guns. It all kicked
off when (i think it was the FBI, but may have been ATF) the FBI shot Randy
Weavers 14 year old son in the back with an MP-5. If someone did that to you
and then surrounded your house with 100's of gunmen, i bet you'd barracade
yourself inside your house.

Then of course they shot an unarmed woman who was holding her baby through
the face with sniper rifle purely because she opend the door.

That is why they were innocents at Ruby Ridge.

Now. McVeigh, theres a different story all together with his clap trap about
"Collaterol damage" and other such shite.

but as an interesting side note, i saw a program last night which claims
that the ATF knew about the Oklahoma bomb in advance, that was why their
office was empty at the time, but they let the bomb go off because they were
about to have their funding dramatically cut, but after the bomb, their
budget went through the roof and the recruited 3 times as many agents. Of
course you have to take this stuff with a pinch of salt. =]
