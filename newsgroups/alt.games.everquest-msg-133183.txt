The Druid Level 52 DoT spell, Breath of Ro looks pretty sweet but then at 53
you get Winged Death which is awsome.  At 53 does Breath of Ro go to the
back of the spell book never to be used again?  A shame to have two nice
spells like this so close together and no update to the 49 AoE :(

Is the Level 52 spell Egress worth getting excited over condidering the new
Level 18 Lessor Succcor?  I am probably missing something but they look
about the same to me.
