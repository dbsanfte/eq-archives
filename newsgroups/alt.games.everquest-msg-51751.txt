If you don't mind the old world, do South Karana.  Thanks do DAoC and the
new EQ continents, it's not as crowded as it used to be.  As a lv. 26 you
can take Aviaks and outer-paw groups up to level 30 and stay bound 2 zones
away in the Arena.  No bad factions there either, paladin.

-Grim

P.S.  After 30, old-world solo'ing zones are Lguk (pallies rock there) and
SolB.  Don't like dungeons?  Heh, well at least try them, that's where the
good stuff is...(even for solo'ing).
