Getting an add (wandering or respawn) is -- by my definition -- a
'mistake.'  So is misplaced aggro.

However, as I said, CHeal isn't quite so overpowering
simply because encounters are tuned expecting CHeal to be
available.  Those mobs that would "shred any group member
but the tank" wouldn't hit so hard if CHeal wasn't in the game.
