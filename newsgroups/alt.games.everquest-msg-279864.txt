Well, for one, when I started playing some 4 years ago, yes, banded was 
appropriate for a level 20. However, you are correct in that better can 
be obtained now well before that, so it only stands to reason that 
banded will not be wanted. It is the newbie armor that eliminates the 
feasibility of the banded, not the formula I suggested.

One other possibility is, considering a scenario where tradesfolk would 
be expected to obtain their own components, that players be encouraged 
to avoid buying crafted items from crafters who are of higher level.

You're speaking of a productionized approach to tradeskilling. Who says 
it has to be that way? That's the kind of mindset we'd like to get away 
from. Skill up as the opportunities present themselves.

A *huge* difference.

There is a bit of a leap of faith involved, to be sure. ;)

Sounds like harmony to me. :)

One way I'll know it's successfull would be to wind up finding myself 
sitting at level 18, for instance, for much longer than any might expect 
and not caring because I'm enjoying the ride once again.

Too many people don't understand that the game was *meant* to be played 
with nothing more than party buffs.

Forget banded, maybe even fine plate as well. Newbie armor has pretty 
much rendered it useless. What level would you need to be to use the 
next best crafted armor? Same for tailoring. Consider jewelcrafting, 
though. It works very well under that premise.

Perhaps not buying from a crafter who is of higher level would be the 
best way to approach it.
