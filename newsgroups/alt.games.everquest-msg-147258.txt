I LIKE IT

....well I like the entertainment factor. Standing around in the Bazaar can be
very boreing so some of the OOC's and shouts relating to the more dubious
Casino operators can be interesting!

Personally I am not daft enough to indulge and it seems to me that the basic
trade rule, i.e. never hand over your money without getting something in
exchange still rules OK

Just out of curiosity I asked one of these Characters if he would take a
50,000pp bet on the proviso he paid out triple if I won. Boy was he eager to
agree. I told him that on reflection I did not think my  placing such an amount
with a lvl 1 character was overtly sensible unless perhaps he showd me
150,000pp in his trade window. He replied it was in the bank and he was too
busy to get it out!
Nuff said.......
