If you had been following the newsgroup for longer, you'd realize that 
that's actually far from the case. Don't take this personally, I've had a 
good laugh with your posts in the last few weeks, but on average, Dan's 
posts include a lot more research and good information than "Can I have 
your stuff?"... Feel free to disagree with him on matters of opinion 
(hell, Dan and I have flamed each other silly over things like the naming 
policy), but questioning his contribution to the group is plainly 
ignorant.
