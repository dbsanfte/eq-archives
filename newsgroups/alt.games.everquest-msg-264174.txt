I used http://www.clanwhitestorm.com/eq2info/ to get alot of good info.  
Most of their info is just cut and paste off the official site but it's 
organized better.  There's also maps on that site.  Most the maps ingame 
are very useful but there's no ingame maps for such places as Antonica(just 
outside Qeynos) and the underground zones.  The map by korrigan is the best 
Antonica map http://www.clanwhitestorm.com/eq2maps/Antonica_by_Korrigan.jpg

Launch day according to various retailers is Nov 8
