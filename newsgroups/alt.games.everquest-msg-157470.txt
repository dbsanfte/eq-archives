That's a bullshit comparison.  First, for every Druid or Wizard I've
known who appreciated the opportunity to make cash off other players
with group ports there're a dozen who absolutely hated the frequent
harassment from players seeking rides (and half the ones who liked
it changed their minds after a while), which makes an overwhelming
majority (of those I know anyway) who're even happier now than they
were when the Nexus opened for business.  Second, group ports are
only a tiny portion of the power of a Druid or Wizard, hardly
comparable to the entirety of a fighter's abilities.  Third, whining
sympathy about losing a zero-investment/zero-risk source of cash
will get you no sympathy from anybody with any brains at all.

Only slightly less bogus than your first try, pretty pathetic really.

What "service" does a Warrior (to pick the most extreme case) have to
offer anybody?  This whine is just as hopelessly pathetic now as it
was when Luclin came out.  Your group ports are still a useful ability
for your group, along with all of your other abilities, just like the
Warrior's tanking and damage dealing are useful to his group.  Grow up,
play the game, and quit whining that your lame-assed source of free pp
isn't as nice as it used to be.

Kaev <--- will still have no sympathy for this bullshit even if they
give Paladins a "must have / no risk" ability that other players will
pay for, and then take it away after three and a half years
