I think VI messed up (<gasp>  Hard to believe, I know).  I didn't find
*any* of the new resurrection spells in Felwithe and in the Kaladim
cleric guild the vendor was selling two different versions of the same
spell (same name, different mana cost).  Reanimation *may* have been
there, but I wouldn't swear to it.

I'm looking for Renewal for my pally friend.  Anyone found that one?
