Got to love those. Back when my monk was growing up in Qeynos, back in
the day, I wandered out into Q Hills and came upon the great named rat,
Scruffy. I defeated him in a battle of epic proportions. (Well, I
thought so. I solo'd him, anyway.) As a reward, I got Scruffy's Head. I
honestly think I would have made level forty before retiring him had I
not spent *days* running around Qeynos, asking every fucking NPC that
would talk to me for their quests. I was just SURE that there must be
some fabulous quest associated with my "rare kill". Now days, my monk
just sits camped at the gnoll village in Iceclad so I can check to see
if Lodazil is up when I log on or off, but if I looked in his bank
account, I bet that rat head is still there.

Ah, Scruffy....... good times.
