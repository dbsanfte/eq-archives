Starting out KOS nearly everywhere is what lessens the impact actually,
starting a necro off from scratch you assume you are a pariah everywhere
except home turf, walking into one higher up you just assume the same thing,
no difference at all really, though I must admit I did con carefully first
time I walked into Neriak just to make sure someone hadn't been "joyriding"
in the worst possible possible way.

I think walking into a "good' character would be more dangerous, you would
fall into a sense of security out of not having to keep faction in mind all
the time - then your characters previous misdemeanours would jump up and
bite your behind when your least expecting it... : /

A necro, shadowknight or Iksar just learns to live with it without second
thought tho.
