This thread has been interesting to me (and prompts me to play a female char
for kicks...) but I think it is interesting that all the talk has been about
the Male players treating female toons in a stereotypical way.

When I started my main in Halas, I interacted with male and female toons and
didnt' notice any overt difference in the interactions with myself and them
or betwixt each other...

however... after a friend ported me to FP and I visited the EC tunnel
(pre-bazaar) I was taken aback at the number of female toons who would
constantly reference me as 'Hun'...  "Sure, Hun",  "Thanks, Hun"... etc...
now, if I was a hormone-charged, straight, 16/17 year old kid, I'd be
flippin' in my blue-jeans and reading all sorts of implications into the
fact that she was calling me 'Hun'.

Further, as I played in the zones between EC and Oasis, I was constantly
'/giggle' -d at, '/hug' -ged, '/kiss' -ed by female toons.  (I'm thinkin -
"geez!  These 'chicks' must not be used to seeing a manly-man barbarian...")
OTH, the guy-toons aren't so freely affectionate with one another on The
Rathe server...  (imagine the slash-fiction ;~)  Dorn and the Orc-Raider...
The three barbarian fishers...  heh heh)

I suggest that some of the gender-roles that exist on EQ are not exclusively
a case of the male gendered players exerting social stereotypes...
