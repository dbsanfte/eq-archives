You weren't to know at the time but,I think you have created a first
in how far a thread can wander and in how short a time. A post with a
*not keen on high elves* joke punch line to a suggestion relating to

I have seen threads go off topic before many times but this far and
this fast, *never* <g> and all you wanted to do was to make us smile.
Well I did anyway,and now i'm gonna find a site to learn about those
