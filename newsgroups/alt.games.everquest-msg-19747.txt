No one controls anything at all. This isn't like the old BBS boards or
the modern web-boards. There are no moderators here, and no one is
systematically deleting posts. The only policing of posts that occurs
is self-policing.

It's possible that your news provider has a crummy news system -
that's a lot more common than it should be.

If you're serious about using a quality news service, from personal
experience I recommend Giganews - their service has been excellent.
