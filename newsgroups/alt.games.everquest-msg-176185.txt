I have a level 50 enchanter, and I've read in a few different threads that
people think they are uber soloers...  Yes, I can solo mobs with my chanter,
but I wouldn't say it's uber.  I'm using the lvl 49 pet with beserker
strength (or spirit, whichever is the higher one of that spell line), slow
mob, hasted pet.  Again, I can do it, it isn't a pain.. but where does the
uberness come in?  I'd love to hear new tactics to use with him, as I love
playing my chanter but.. well, time constraints, so I've gotta solo a lot.
I guess that's why my druid keeps leveling and my post fifty chars aren't
going anywhere.

Thanks for any new ways of thinking about my chanter,

~Snared.
