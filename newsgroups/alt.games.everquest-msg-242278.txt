It was a bug. It wasnt a change in the default icon files, it was abug
in 'masking'. That pink, believe it or not, is used as a transparency
mask in a lot of the EQ graphics. When that pink is there it is replaced
with 'see through'.

Except, of course, when theres a bug that makes it visible. I imagine
the same bug was responsible for the lack of sky textures and the
violently pink sphere in the sky for the moon/sun (which suggests the
sun might be a static image with a changing pink mask over it to
fade it in out, oo)

Thats my take on it anyway. ;)
