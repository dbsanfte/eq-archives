Yes. ;) Actually, I only saw them dropped. RL took me away from the
beta before they got the adventure vendors fully stocked, but I
believe they carry some augmentation gems.

The adventure vendor shows how many you have. It's a different
purchase menu from a normal vendor... I didn't see a way to check
point totals away from them, but there might be one.

>adventure points?

Gear does drop in the dungeon, yes.

Only missions I ever got were 90 minutes. The raids are longer,
though. I didn't get a chance to go on a raid...
