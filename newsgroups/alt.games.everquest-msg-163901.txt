    More like buying their soul really. If it cant be truly sold, it cant be
truly bought.

    If it was about playing with your friends why not get your lvl 60

    He should refund your $450 and explain his actions to you, hes
definitely in the wrong for going back on the deal and not refunding. What
do you hope to achieve by posting his real life details here?

    Although as someone else mentioned your post here is highly beneficial
as anyone who reads it is unlikely to make your mistake.

    My sympathy for your situation (making a liar out of Dark Tyger hehe)
but seriously you may's well spent the $450 on swampland
