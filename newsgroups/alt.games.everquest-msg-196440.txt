It just doesn't match my experience in game. I have yet to see a group
say 'now that we have KEI lets move to a harder dungeon/camp'. I find
that people tend to stick to the same spots either way, just killing

I heard a lot of the same arguements from people when they took away
the book to med. How it made things easier and players wouldn't be as
good a player....
