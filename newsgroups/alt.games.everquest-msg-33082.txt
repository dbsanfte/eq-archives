When I was finishing my Innoruuk's Curse, I had petitioned a GM to be
present when we killed Lhranc to mak sure no one tried to ploot me.  It took
about 2 hours to get a response, but a Senior guide did in fact port in, and
watched the battle without intefereing, and when we killed him, I pomptly
looted the sword, and was congratulated by the guide.  I think it's
unfortunate that steps like this have to be taken, but you never know who'll
run by and loot before you can, especially when you're not in the kill
group.
