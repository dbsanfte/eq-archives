It was in a post you replied to yesterday and seemed to be referencing in
this thread.  Not surprisingly, your response didn't seem to evidence your
having actually read the post.  I guess this just confirms that impression.

I don't think you're hard to argue with.  I think you're hard to have an
intelligent conversation with because you are too busy trying to argue. 
Your arguing itself is rather weak because you chase semantics.
