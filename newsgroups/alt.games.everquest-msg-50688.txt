Example in Velks the other day

15 people in zone which was 4 groups of people

/ooc LVL 55 Enchanter LFG

Silence

Then one by one all members of the people fighting happened to pass by the
zone entrance and wonder if they could have clarity/haste etc.

Karnors is a shit hole
I need to get a new key for Seb and finish key for HS but not many pickup
groups there
