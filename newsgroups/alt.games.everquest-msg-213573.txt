Not at all, actually. You have every right to sell the disks. The fact
that no one is interested in buying the disks without the keys doesn't
mean that your right to sell them has been taken from you. You have NO
right to sell the keys unless given to you by the one who owns them:
SOE.

Wow. That is a desperate reach. I'm soooo glad that your idea of
what's ethical isn't the "accepted" one.

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.

-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 

(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
