    My newest alt, a Erudite Shadowkight, was born last
night.  I was having so much fun with my ranger I decided
it might be fun to try another hybrid, and not having
any evil characters at all, I decided it might be 
interesting to dive into the abyss and embrace the 
darkness.  I chose Erudite for several reasons.  I know
that strong cases can be made for the opinions that 
other possibel SK races are "better" due to natural
stats and racial abilities.
   My main curiousity is about the faction my SK will
face when she leaves Paineel.  I'm not to concerned 
about _how_ to leave; my husband has an enchanter that
can cast invis on her.  But I'm wondering what might be
in store for her when she hits the main land.  Will 
there be _any_ cities where she is not KOS?  Could she
go to Freeport, or maybe any of the evil cities such as
Neriak or Grobb?  Or will she only be able to use the 
tunnels to sneak into NFP to bank, and use the Tunnel
merchants in EC to buy and sell?  If she makes it that 
far, will she be able to bank and shop anywhere in 
Kunark or Velious?
   One last question.  Will she ever be able to cast
any night vision spells on herself?  If not, what 
infravision items should she look for?  I knew that
the blindness thing was going to be an issue when I
made her, and I accept that limitation.  But I was
hoping that she wouldn't be stuck holding a GLS for
her whole career.
