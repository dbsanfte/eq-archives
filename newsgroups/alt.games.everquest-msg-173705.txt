This looks interesting.  I stayed in Seb last night, we got one jacinth
and one diamond.  Of course I didn't win the rolls.  In fact I don't
think I've EVER got a jacinth on a roll in Seb, and I used to group
there ALOT.  At least it looks like it may be possible to get a group
there still at night, but I'm probably better off in EW in the morning. 
I used to charm the Kael guards and kill everything with them, although
my favorite is the captain at the camp in NW EW.  

There's a problem with the othimir though.  A friend needs some serious
help getting his tailoring up and says the easiest way is to make
othimir caps...  If I help him out with this (by killing them for pelts)
I won't be able to turn in the tusks.

Thanks for the suggestion.
