    Congrats!! Lord, you two are really flying up in levels, aren't you?

    Yes. He will go outside and blow himself up still, but the second person
will be the only person that has to wait for him to respawn.

    If you want to really, um, "challenge" yourself sometime, do this with
the Caller quests in Fungus Grove. You can hand in multiple bottles/kegs
when you do the initial turn-in, and the Caller will go into overdrive.
He'll walk to the cave, and start calling multiple times. So if you handed
in two Kegs, for example (three mobs every two minutes), every two minutes
he'd do the call emote twice and you'd get six mobs. When your guild is
farming snare pods it's great - just have to make sure you can handle all
the mobs being spawned in one place.
