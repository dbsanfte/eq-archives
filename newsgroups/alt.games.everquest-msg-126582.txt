Hello;

  This is just a quick post to let people know that YALP version 2.1
is now available for download at http://members.shaw.ca/yalp. If you
dont know, YALP is yet another log parser for EverQuest.

  Version 2.1 now includes full third party damage in the fight list,
and is slightly faster than before. YALP is still quite young, and I
could really use some feedback to help make it a great log parser.
Please visit the website, and see for yourself if YALP is the log
parser for you.

Thanx, and happy EQ'ing...

Thulie Clovus
