Oh yes.  Absolutely.  Back when KEI was first out, they "neglected" to put a
level requirement on it.  You could slap a KEI on a level 1 character ....
and a lot of folks did.

They also didn't learn how to manage mana, because their cup was always
overflowing.

Then they proceeded to whine, bitch, and moan when the level restriction was
put in to place because they didn't know how to play their characters
without the crutch of endless mana.

Which ties directly to the "I can't play without a Temp at lvl 12"
discussion.
