Do not be sorry, I am not trying to sell you anything, I am teaching
about a new method to store enough heat in one minute, to keep a plate
hot for 1/2 hour or more.
You do not understand it because it is new, I invented it.Arrogance in

Makes the mind stupid. Do you know the meaning of the word "Mentecato"
mentecato?
I'll give you a hint: it comes from latin. (Mentis captus).
