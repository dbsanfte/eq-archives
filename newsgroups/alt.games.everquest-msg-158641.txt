The Ranger was charmed by one of the mobs, it will show as LD when someone
is charmed.

Easier for you to head back in fully equipped form your bind spot than to
try to run in naked, and, under the circumstances, with no crowd control,
you were going to die with 5 mobs, plus your ranger to fend off.  So, yes,
you probably did the right thing, it would have served no useful purpose for
you to die with everyone else.  One suggestion, the Wizard should have his
evac spell memorized, and should be ready to cast it to get anyone still
alive out.
