I've seen a power-leveled rogue get to 17 in under 3 hours.
I've little doubt he hit 20 in the next hour or two.  (Druid,
chanter, cleric trio, all 60's, power-leveling in Najena.  Rogue
came in at level 4, left less than three hours later at 17 and
went to another zone for power-leveling.  The rogue was 50+ in
under two weeks.  Probably would have been faster, but they were
all in one of the server's raiding guilds.

So how's that a huge difference?  Buying a 20 rogue or having
one in four hours?
