What is the primary purpose of a guild?


How does porting work (ie who do you need to arrange it and where?) ;
I've seen a portal in North Karana and wondered what was going on. 


 I have one character (lvl 18 Barb Shaman). I have installed Kunark
and Velious. Is there any benefit in installing Luclin now? My PC and
should be able to handle it OK (P4 1600 with 512 DDR RAM; ADSL Modem).
Do I need it to develop this character further(prior to Luclin), or is
it only for higher characters.

What did Velious give me that I didn't have with Kunark?


And, are runes the wizard's equivalent to a shammy scroll?

thanks.
