	I hit 60 (Ranger) about a week and a half ago myself.  I've had Swiftwind
since May of last year, Earthcaller since November.

	I soloed 90% of the time to 50, then better than half the time to 53.  I
was 48 when the hybrid penalty was lifted, and 51 when Rangers got Panic
Animal.  I spent five months at level 55 attending every Hate raid I could get
on trying for the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.
