Would not necessarily say so. As long as I have a main tank, I'd take
a rogue any day .. I love BS. But I met people in the 40/50ties, still
thinking they're some kind of weak tank. Not very well informed people,
I agree :) It;s a bit like Shamen used to be. I met people not even
knowing they can heal or haste. It got better though ... I think with
Rogues as well.

And get a main tank, who knows what he's doing. With an SK twink, I found
out, which cheap spells let me take aggro most of the time. I don't know
yet, how to cat my new warrior apart from the taunt button and alternative
taunt like 'beg' (Does beg really do that much?).

: to keep the tank alive on a mob that hits for 300+ per and can quad.

Ha. Know theses. As a shaman with slow, I more often than not get some close
encounter of those :P Sometimes even if you cast slow when a mob is nearly
dead (not useful .. was more of an experiment). It just aggros them way
over the normal in some cases.
