Well, I would pay some other company to release a game that would bleed
of a bit of the high end overcrowding:-)

I think you have to accept that when you have been level 60 for 6
months, and killed every mob in the game 6 times, it is time to move on
and find something else to do.

If you raid 4 times a day, every day, like most top guilds do, you are
going to run out of new content pretty quickly.

On the other hand, someone like me, who raids once or twice a week, will
take about 2 years to get to that same point (starting from current
level 55 with epic). Hopefully the full-timers will have moved on before
then.
