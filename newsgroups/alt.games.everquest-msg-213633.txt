Though I often mess around on other servers, I always return to FV.  The 
population's low, the community's generally cool, and it feels like one is 
less an outcast nerd if one roleplays.  The one-character-per-account rule 
means, IMO, that reputation matters more, and you're more likely to 
recognize the names you see as you run around.

We've got a message board at http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie which is 
worth checking out, too.

So.  Come.  Joooooin us.  All the cool kids are doing it and you *know* you 
want to.  :)

Oh, and yeah, the idea of an <AGE> guild there sounds majorly spifftastic.
