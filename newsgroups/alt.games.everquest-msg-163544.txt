 Ok, I agree that I don't have the anwser for the cap. I guess its more of a
complaint directed towards the people who put Cloth shirts up for 10k, just
because they think its funny. It's not funny having to brows thru all the
crap to find what you need.

As far as the Epic goes, I have a 48 Shadow Knight. His epic, is probably
one of the hardest in all of EQ. My point being, why go thru the whole quest
for a weapon that has become less then desirable ? I love the thrill of a
good quest, but I also like the way people look at you when you flaunt the
reward. Now days they basically say "Nice Job on the quest, but look what I
got in the Bazaar".
 Why quest a weapon when I can buy a better one?

I think your basically right, why call it an Epic.

Just my .02ï¿½
