Looks like we have a very different oppinion of his work.
I found GiL very dissapointing after GwOM.
The ending seemd so abrupt, as if he got very involved in writing the
story, then suddenly realised that the spec was for an x page story and
he had already written x - 100 and needed to finish it off quickly.

For me the short stories felt like assignments, like "write a dark fairy
story that deal with father son relationships". While being dark I found
the "twists" either over involved or telegraphed.
