My SK can summon "her" own corpse like this but as this character is an alt
(albeit twinked) it's a lesser concern.

Thanks for the suggestions, shame I know no Necro's anymore (used to know
close to a dozen, our guild was full of them, but they all sort of quit)
Think I'll try the zone's /ooc channel first, offer a plat reward for the
summons as well as providing reagents before I start using /who all lists.
Would rather not bother players directly with tells unless I really have to.

Well I can swallow exp loss it's corpse loss that bothers me.

I'll make an appointment with Split Paw as well after this...although even
with summon corpse I'd still be screwed on the Druid, Nec and Druid are on
same account.
