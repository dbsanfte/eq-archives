/shrug

I've used it.  Crypt, in OS, for instance.  Nice place to
know when the PH spawns for something you're not actively
camping since you're having trouble monitoring all the
different spawns and keeping up.  (Crypt was fun at 52...)

A single message to anyone triggering it would be fine and
a much less intrusive spell, but it does have it's uses.
Just like True North:  when you're on your first toon or
don't know an area, it's nice to be able to know ONE
direction anyway without waiting to get a Sense Heading
hit (which can take a LONG time at level 1...)
