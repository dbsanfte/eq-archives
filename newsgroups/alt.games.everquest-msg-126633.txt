Well, entertainment is most always good, but "surprising"?  Come on,
now, Lokari. That type of sig is nothing, if not *intended* to provoke
those types of storms. If you're going to take a pot shot at something
which is likely to put a stick in the hornets' nest, and do it in a
group where the majority of the readers live in primarily
Judeo-Christian countries, taking a crack at the Bible has to be damn
near the top of the list.

Not that I mind, let's be clear. I'm far from religious in *any* sense,
though I travel in groups of friends that include most of the major ones
and a surprising number of Wiccans. (Somehow the Society for Creative
Anachronism seems to draw them like flies to sugar.)  But you can't come
out taking what most conservative Christians would consider a rather
blatant, blasphemous swing at the Old Testament (silly though it may be)
and not expect some sort of large scale reaction.
