Well your talking about a lot of stuff post-EB (ratios are getting silly
now), with mostly intelligent ppl in regards to agro management

To say EB is not effective, or 100% effective tho is completly and utterly
untrue.

If I group with a pre-EB warrior, I know either a) Im tank..  b) Im fding
every 10 seconds.
That applies to raids too, but not just to high dps classes, but debuffers,
clerics/priests etc.

Btw howcome the duel-eb warrior in your guilds using a BoC?  Hategiver has a
better ration.

SoD's are still nice agro too... guildie warr with 2 SoD's never had
problems holding agro.

So no, its not specific to EB procs, but anything of that "era" or level...
