The Giants armor quests are better for the Melee classes, they have better AC
The Dragons armor quests are better for the Caster classes and have better resistances.
and the Dwarfs seems to be a lesser mix of both.

For example the warrior's breast plates:

Dwarf:
Champion's Breastplate +47AC +14Str +10Sta +5Agi +7Dex +4vsMg +10vsPos +90HP +17.50 Wt
effect:Invigorate

Dragon:
Breastplate of the Myrmidon +54AC +15Str +10Sta +7Agi +7Dex +10vsMg +5vsFire +5vsCold
+10vsDis +90HP +17.50 Wt effect:Invigorate

Giant:
Warlord's Breastplate +59AC +16Str +10Sta +7Agi +7Dex +6vsMg +10vsCold +90HP +17.50 Wt
effect: Invigorate


Personally given a choice I'd go for the giant BP as it has the
highest AC and warriors get beat on 99.9% of the time.
But other faction and guild considerations obviously are
a factor.
