Sure, but if you got 3 casters in your group low on mana, I think
the groups total effectiveness is much higher when you bring their
mana up :) A group is not about you, it's about total performance.
Besides, the leader decides what your role is, join another group
if you like. I for my part hate it when I am half at health and our
cleric things he has to tank right now, being at 30% mana himself.
As a tank, I of course like speed songs and such, too.

Oh yes, I agree. All those monks training their ID skill on the mob,
till it works in the most wrong situation and you got half of Chardok
on your ass.

Ebay?

:   - Druids cast SOW on bards

Saves you twisting of Selos in a hasty situation, not? There's other
songs more needed than selos, or are you running away :)
