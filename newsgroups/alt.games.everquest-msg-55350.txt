PvP was fun when I played, though it was hampered by various things
(unbalanced classes), nodrop armour on RZ (sigh), and an absolute
excess of rules and regulations that were never clearly defined.

I often asked myself that....usually while I was medding and prepping
to go kill some more of those people.

Ever since Darkenbane left RZ, it's gone far worse (imo). I did play
my chars a few times occasionally after that and the atmosphere was
gone. It smelt too blue, I mean my chars are always in various pk
guilds but it just seemed like people weren't even doing /who anymore.

The only time I ever really ever got attacked was when some drood
would want the dwarf spawns in bb or something. A pity imo.

Ahh Blart (51 shaman pk on RZ). Runs a funny pk guild on RZ (or used
to anyway).

Personally I don't think what he did was that bad considering it was
to all the people who chose "team easy levelling" (evil).

It was Ruin (otherwise known as Legacy of Steel from the Nameless). As
far as I know, Conquest play Daoc now.

It's not pointless, you get the thrill of the kill :p
