Key is no drop.  you could get a shrink potion to lose some of that
weight you trolls seem so proud of packing on, or you could get an alt
to open the door for you all, only one person would still have to
squeeze through then, or maybe you could get a newbie in the area (yes
they do occasionally exist) to buy the key and open the door for you
all.  You only need one key for your whole group basically, assuming you
will have someone to rez you, not having a key and dying wouldn't be an
issue unless you all died, but then your cleric friend shouldn't have
issues squeezing through.

haven't been inside the hole, so I can't answer your other questions =(
