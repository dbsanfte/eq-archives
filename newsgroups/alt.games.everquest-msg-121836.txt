Yet another head scratcher.

I took a raid group into TD today to get the epic for one of our druids.
Had over FOUR full groups of mid to upper fifties, primarily. (a few
lower.) MA was a 57 warrior, top two clerics were an epic 60 and a 59.
Also had a 59 pally. No wizards, which is bad, but a gaggle of druids,
couple necros, a mage and a shammy or two, so not too bad. Triggered Fay
and got down to 10% without too many "oops" deaths, and just.. stalled.
Stayed at 10%.Problem was, that getting to 10% was done almost entirely
by melee. Then we got some ping-ponging, casters dropping, suddenly the
MA is down and it was a TPW.

The reports from the casters later on indicated that most of them failed
to land a single nuke, even if higher in level than Fay. The mage got
one in, and was level 55. It was just weird.

Not a happy day. Might have been just a screwup on several people's
parts, bad RNG luck, etc., but it certainly sucked. Seemed like Fay's
health bar just STOPPED at around 10%.

I guess I don't have a point unless anyone else has seen something
similar.
