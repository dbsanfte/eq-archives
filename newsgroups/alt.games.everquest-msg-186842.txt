    It seems you need to be told what it refers to with reference to
Everquest. Although he was off by a factor of 100 in his interpretation, Ben
Haddick got right in principle what it is. It is a well-known term.

    He was harsh with you over what seems to be a minor misunderstanding. If
I'd never heard of a ZEM, I imagine I'd have made the same guess you did.
But you thrashing around after that with the usual "you have no life if you
know this, u r teh suck" stuff is comical. You read an Everquest newsgroup,
so guess what - you suck just like the rest of us to the over 99% of the
population that does NOT play EQ.
