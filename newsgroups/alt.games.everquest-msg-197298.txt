Well, you will level this way, but you won't get those skills up nearly as
quickly, since you'll keep having to go find more cougars to kill.  If you feel
sufficiently confident, you can move to Igloo island where lots of the cats
spawn, forgo the safety of the zone line in trade for faster pulls.

I assumed, though, that you were looking for a way to "powerlevel" those skills
up, since you'd accidentally neglected them, and were looking for the fastest
possible way to raise them.  If you are using a cleric buddy to chain DonalVam
you, for example, he will probably appreciate your getting skills as fast as
possible so as to waste less of his time.

An alternative plan would be to find a faction giving set of mobs, such as
frost giants or coldain wolves or something along these lines, so that your
high level buddy is getting faction hits on every kill, now he's at least
getting a reward for his time.
