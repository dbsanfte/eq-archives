Is Kithicore in the daytime too dangerous for a level 12 mage that just
wants to deliver some mail?  I'm reading the eqAtlas information that says
the area has become much more dangerous, even in the daytime.  I'll just be
passing through on my way to HighKeep.

If it is a "substantial" risk, does mail delivery have a time limit, or can
I just hold onto it until I've reached an appropriate level?

Cheers,
Eric
