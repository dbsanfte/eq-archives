I had a close friend die of lymphoma cancer last Christmas. My
grandfather died of lung cancer last spring. EQ hasn't put up any
banners expressing sympathy for the victems of a much longer, more
painful, and emotionally taxing death. 

Damn heartless bastards.

I care. I don't need a banner to pop up on EQ to tell me that they
care.
