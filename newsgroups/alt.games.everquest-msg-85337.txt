    Heh. "Fully thought through". Verant. "Fully thought through". I'm
surprised you can say that with a straight face. :-)

    On our server, Quellious, the top guild decided to wake the Sleeper as a
knee-jerk reaction to the second best guild's forcing a rotation in NToV
(the top guild tried to CotH ahead of guild #2's first NToV raid, trained
everyone, and got talked to by the GMs). Until that point they weren't
considering it - I brought it up in a talk between myself and one of their
recruiting officers not two weeks previous. They did it copycat-style with
the FoH strat, and even wiped out first try (sound familiar, Ben?) And the
people who complained the most on my server were the second best guild and
the third best guild alliance, which had just made it to ten keys when this
happened.

    Ignore the stupid lewt that was eliminated forever by doing this,
although the top guild did shaft even themselves in this regard (no more
gear to outfit new recruits replacing retirees). During the ending few
months of Velious, top guilds everywhere were crying about how there were no
challenges left that were reasonably killable. Ventani was EXACTLY the sort
of challenge they were whining for, yet as soon as a strat was published
they made sure Ventani would never be killed again. So much for the spirit
of discovery and exploration, or being in EQ for the challenges.
