my question is, how do I know which of my windows is causing the message?
Everything seemed
to be working fine...

I haven't found an easy way.  In my UI i have only changed 6 windows so when
i first got a message like this i booted up my second computer while sharing
the 'uifiles' folder on my main.  Then i cut and pasted all the files but
one in a different spot and tried to load it, if it failed i removed that
file and tried the next one, until by process of elimanation i found the
culprit.  If you don't have two computers, then you will be camping out of
eq a lot.  Also make sure that you only have the files you want modified in
the uifile folder that you load.  And check which of the default files
Verant has modified recently, this may point you in the right direction to
finding what you want.
