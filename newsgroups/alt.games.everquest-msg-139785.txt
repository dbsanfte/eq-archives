Sneak doesn't drop.  BUT, when you hail an NPC, they tend to turn
around to talk to you.  And when you hand something in for a quest
they tend to turn around to talk to you.  You need to be behind them
to maintain indifferent faction from sneak.

That means you need to sneak in, be behind them, not hail them, and
turn things in one at a time.  If they turn around when you give them
the item, then get behind them before turning in the next item.  And
if their natural faction is KOS, be prepared to run and/or FD after
the first turn-in, if they turn around.

I used sneak to turn in helms and toes to the NPCs in Skyshrine, with
my natural faction being dubious.  I found I couldn't do multiple
turn-ins because the NPC would turn around and talk to me after the
first turn-in, and then eat my pieces for the other turn-ins.  So I
would get "Oh, I love you, here is money, experience and faction"
followed immediately by "I don't aid scum like you" while it ate my
other three items.  It was the NPC turning around that cancelled the
sneak, not the opening of the trade window.

If in doubt, open the trade window and con them again to make sure
they are still indifferent, before hitting the accept.
