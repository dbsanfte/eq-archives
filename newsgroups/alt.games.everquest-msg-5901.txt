My main is a level 20/21 (she keeps getting 21st, but has yet to see it stick)
halfling druid. Too inexperienced for group teleports, but she has more than
300pp in the bank (and had more than 100pp *after* buying all of her 19th level
spells.) This is what has worked for her...

Do everything you can to save money. That meant taking up tailoring (about half
her armor is studded she made herself) and either using or selling *every*
piece. A ruined pelt (free) and a pattern (~7sp) will make a piece of tattered
that sells for more than a gold. At 4th level, that was better profit than from
fire beetle eyes. An added advantage for a monk is that a piece of patchwork
weighs much less than a pelt.

Milk the cash cows. Rosewhite still collects bone chips and (because of her
baking) always has a few stacks of batwings on her. These can be traded for
services (auction for a Locate Corpse in exchange for a stack of bone chips and
see how many junior necros will come to help) or sold for 1pp to as much as 7pp
per stack. If someone is offering to buy a stack of chips only from 5th level or
lower, sell them to a lowbie for 5gp or 1pp.

Standard income. Greater lightstones can be exchanged for a Concordance of
Research, which sells for between 7pp and 10pp each. Or you can sell GLSs for
6pp to 10pp to folks doing the Concordance quest for experience or tailors
making Wu's gauntlets. On Xev, HQ bear pelts sell in East Commons for as much as
20pp each, and silk swatches for 1pp each.

Take up a trade. With the changes in foodstuffs, I have found fish rolls (1
fresh fish, 1 bat wing, banquet sized meal, 0.1 weight) to be very profitable.
The ingredients are very inexpensive or even free, they have a high enough
trivial (135) that many people don't try it themselves, and are in demand,
especially by monks and evil races/classes who normally find getting food a
challenge. I have sold them for as much 3pp a stack; 1pp would still be
profitable. Tailoring, as stated above, can be profitable from the very start;
with a sewing kit you can also make weight reducing bags, 10 slot back packs,
raw silk armor (1pp/AC) and cured silk (2pp/AC, monk only) armor.

A few tips. Hope it helps.
