My apologies if this gets posted twice - my ISP is having problems
with news atm, so I'm sending through google as well.

Just had a most unfortunate thing happen to Gennas, my level 30
halfling druid.  My own stupid fault, of course, as these things
always are.

I was hunting in SolA with a partner, and fell into the lava pit by
the window room.  I had fire resist on, so I lasted a little while as
I hunted around trying to find a wall to climb up.  I couldn't learn a
gate spell, because I was being constantly hit for damage.  Of course
there are no climbable walls, but then suddenly I found myself zoning
- ended up in SolB!  Hunted around in there, no suitable walls, then
zoned back to SolA (hell, I didn't have a clue as to where I was going
- I was staring at the ceiling most of the time, trying to find a way
up).  I was passed back and forth between SolA and SolB a couple of
times, before I died.  Unfortunately I happened to be in SolB at the
time, which is going to be a tricky level to travel through to attempt
a corpse recovery.

To cap it all, it was just before they took the servers down for
today's patch... a brief excerpt from my log:

About a minute later the servers went, and I was disconnected whilst
camping.

The weird thing is that the loc given isn't valid in SolB or the
Bazaar (my bind point), and wouldn't be anywhere near any lava in
SolA.  I think I managed to type /l just as I died.  So where the hell
is my corpse?  My guess from looking at the maps (and ignoring the
loc) is that it's in the lava pool by the King, Priest and Champion's
rooms in SolB, but I'm unlikely to survive a trip there to find out.

I think I may have to give up on all my equipment - my chances of
getting it back seem pretty slim.  Shame, as I'd just managed to get
my wisdom up to 169, where it belongs.  :(

If anyone such as a 50+ necromancer is able to help and thus earn my
undying gratitude, Gennas is on Antonius Bayle, naked and likely to
stay that way.
