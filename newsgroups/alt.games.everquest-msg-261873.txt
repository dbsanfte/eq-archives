Wicked. I used to be able to cast pretty reliably while staggering 
drunk... Finally a use for my 200 AT on my enchanter though, if I ever 
play again.

I seem to remember drunk used to wear off overnight... get drunk, log 
for the night, you sober up the next morning most of the way.

At any rate, I came up before PoP, I used to drink a little all along my 
  runs hither and yon. I'd even occasionally keep myself on the edge of 
'staggering' in boring xp grind groups, much to the annoyance of the 
other players 'Why the hell are you drinking?' 'Cause it makes the 3 
mezzes every hour more exciting'.

Too bad one can't get drunk in Final Fantasy.
