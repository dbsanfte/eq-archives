Yeah. Its pretty dramatic vis a vis what it was before.

I wasn't logged in long, and only took 70 or 80 from falling damage 
running around pok, but standing i was getting 4 per tick, and sitting 
got me 6/tick immediately, and it scaled to 8 per tick after a 
minute-ish ... but then i was full.

I heard its even better at higher levels.

The ability to bind to 70% *and* benefit from sitting at the same time 
is serious enhancement...
