They are apparently refunding IRE (which hurt pet-canni by the way).

Well - SM2 is still very useful if you raid, and in a few other situations.

They are refunding IRE because it will do nothing now.  However they should
refund Quick Summoning.  The only good reason to get it was pet canni - in
fact we point to it as SOE recognizing pet-canni as a legitimate part of 
the mage class.  The only other use for it is quicker CoH's, and they
dislike that spell enough already.  Additionally I'd never have taken 
elemental pact but for pet-canni.

That's as much as 18 pts for QS, 5 pts for EP that should be refunded
to people.
