You miss the point; giving them a disc that makes it so they
have no back restores their tanking ability.  I'm trying to
retain their "survive pulling" ability without giving them back
the tanking ability... my suggestion is to restore their current
mitigation levels but only to "from behind" mobs... sort
of an anti-backstab if you will.

Of course smart mobs would try to attack the monk
from a U shape, denying him the protection this accords...
good thing verant doesnt' design smart mobs.
