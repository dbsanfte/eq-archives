Berserker throwers have some pretty amazing stats at the higher levels, 
and come in large quantities for little money and no need to camp 
anything at all.  They are No Drop, Berserker only, all races.

Occurs to me that a low level berserker could do very well throw kiting 
with the high level versions of these things; he's got snare, the only 
problem with throw kiting in general is that damage output tends to be 
pretty low.  But with a much higher ratio thrower, it strikes me that 
wouldn't be true.

Course eventually he'll level up to the point where buying throwers even 
from a level 65 just doesnt boost throw damage enough to make a 
difference, but it would be a different way to get thru say levels 20 
thru 40.
