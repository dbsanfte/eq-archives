The naked ass is the problem, right?

Your leggings are visible. Your problem is that on a half elf, that's
exactly what they are - leather leggings. They end somewhere around
mid thigh, IIRC.

They'll show up just as fine as the leather, but they should also
cover your rear end properly :)

*shrug* I'm sure that any weak male who decides to drool at my SK
until I get her plate leggings can be brought even more easily to
succumb to her evil whims than the rest >:)

I used to know a female half elf warrior who was saving up for
crafted. She had a helm, she had armor on her arms and I believe her
feet, but the rest of her was leather or cloth. Guys liked her a lot.
