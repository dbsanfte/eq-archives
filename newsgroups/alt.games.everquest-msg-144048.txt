hehe.. with 3 guilds working on it at the same time, i figure we'll see the
emporer sometime in the next year

Monk can probably do a better job than a druid (or as good as).. monk beats
on the mob, feigns when its low HP, twink finishes the mob, gets full exp.

Any combination can make a good pleveler tho.. one time I used cleric (60)
mage (54ish) and a baby wizard.  mage cast DS on cleric+wizard, cleric
pulled, mobs beat on cleric dieing to the AE, wizard casts a rain spell,
gets exp on all of them.

DS is nice when your fighting super higher level mobs where you just can't
kill it with spells/melee ro you'd be there all day.. do at least 1 point of
damage, then keep it rooted and the DS will kill it for ya
