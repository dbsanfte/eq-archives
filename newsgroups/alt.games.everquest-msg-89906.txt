As others have noted, the best soloing classes I know of are Necromancer and 
Druid.  Also consider Magicians (I have soloed one to the early 50s).  
Others to consider are Monks (takes a specific strategy) and Shaman (may 
need to group twixt 25 and 34).  If travel is your interest, then the class 
you want is Druid.  You get Spirit of Wolf at 14 I think (lets you run 
faster) and several teleport spells (self and group) at higher levels.  
However, druid "invisibility" only works in outdoor zones.

May I suggest that you visit http://eq.castersrealm.com/ for more data on 
the above classes?  Also, http://www.eqlinks.com/ can lead you on to other 
sites relevant to your class of choice.
