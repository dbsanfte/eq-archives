Not entirely true, clerics get the heal spells earlier than druids and 
shaman, and even pre level 39, are better suited to the role of primary 
healer.  I remember many times, particularly when I was within one or two 
levels of getting my next heal spell, when I just could not function as 
the primary healer in a good xp group, at least not without lots of 
downtime.

Back in the day, I remember many times when I tried to fill the role of 
primary healer (see above), and found that I just did not have good 
enough heals to do the job well.  I still find, at level 69, that if I am 
xping in fire, I cannot work effectively as the primary healer, my heals 
are just not big enough to keep up with a partially slowed mobs damage 
output.  There certainly are places I can xp in a group as the main 
healer, but, there are also ones where I cannot.  A druid OTOH, can 
function in those places as the main healer, assuming, as with a cleric, 
there is some type of slower in the group.  Perhaps when I get my last 
one or two missing heal spells that will change, I don't know, I don't 
have them yet, and don't see it as being likely I will anytime real soon.
