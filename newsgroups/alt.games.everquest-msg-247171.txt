I'm a necromancer.  I solo'ed pretty much the entire 1-60, then grouped most
of 60-65 because I was tired of soloing and I had a shaman and a mage pair
of friends to parter with on a regular basis.  As for solo xp not being
worth it: I would say I can do an aa on my lunch break in Fire.  The only
group better than that is an elemental one.  Not elemental flagged?  HoH
humans yield an aa for me in just over an hour, less if I do the back room
and never have to fight more than one sentry at a time.  HoH solo is still
better xp than an LDoN adv, which is where most pick up groups go these
days.
