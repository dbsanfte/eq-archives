Try this:

Without someone else doing crowd control, do it yourself.  You've got
roots, use them.   Everyone should be assisting the main assist, so
you should be able to /assist them, then pick another mob to root.
If there's more mobs, root them as well.    Then heal when the tanks
need a heal, not before.  The roots on the other ones shouldn't be
broken until someone starts hitting it, so when it does break either
the mob won't have you on top of the hate list anymore or the group
will be concentrating on killing it and should be able to get it off you
pretty quickly.   If you've put a damage shield up on the tanks, they
might even already be on top of the hate list and the mobs won't
ever go after you.

Other than that, if you have two melee-types, one should be the MA
and another (with taunt if at all possible) should be assigned to
watch you.   Create a hotkey something like this:

/gsay HEALER AGRO'D -- GET THIS OFF ME

and use it when a mob starts beating on you.   Don't EVER hit a
mob that's not the target of the MA with anything (even your
roots should not have a damage component.)   If you start getting
hit, hitting it with your melee weapon just adds more damage that
whoever is going to pull it off you needs to overcome.   And after
it is pulled off of you, move somewhere else to sit down.

Other than that, patience.   Clerics get Superior Healing at 34 (a
spell druids don't get until 51) and Complete Healing at 39 (along
with their first XP rez) and druids as primary healers in groups
that don't function well -- especially in dungeons -- aren't very
common.   (A well-functioning group with crowd control doesn't
need a cleric in most cases, although most pick-up groups will
still want one.)  Then you'll get all the dungeon crawling you want
as secondary healer and evac'er.
