I know half the people reading this are going to scream when they hear 
this, but I won't use a custom UI.

I dont want to spend that much time tinkering with something, I want the 
thing to work more or less the way it always has.  I also expect, 
generally, that the default UI will work or SOE will tear the servers 
down and keep patching till it does, while any custom job is SOL if 
there's a problem.

I used the original UI for many months after the new one was released, 
only surrendering to the new default when there was little choice; and 
even now I crunch down the viewport to a big box in the middle 
surrounded by the various displays and controls, more or less like the 
original UI.

The customizability of the default UI is pretty nice, and I admit from 
time to time I'm tempted to take that to the next level by going 
custom... but in the end I just don't want to take that step.
