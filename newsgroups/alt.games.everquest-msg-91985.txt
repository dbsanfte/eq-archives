Ah, James. If you are not IRL working in professional politics, you

fail to answer it but, instead, provide an answer to a question you
<wished> had been asked, while making it look like an answer are.....
impressive. ;-)

Perhaps your guild feels that way. Please don't speak for all of them.
I've seen the stats on the primal. That would have to be one hell of a
risk to not make it worth the reward. Plus (and this will become very
important further below) there is more to the reward than just the loot.
Just accomplishing the monumental task of getting ST keys for your
guild, going there, experiencing it, and having the *chance* at some
primal. That's a reward in and of itself. You normally don't sound like
such a powergamer. I hope your new guild association isn't ruining the
idealist we've come to know and love here. :-)
(And while we're on that topic, could you please start a new thread for
us to go into how you are suddenly in a raiding guild after our week
long debate here where you tried to teach me why guilds were a worthless
waste of your time, no fun, etc. etc. etc. I'd hate to clog up this fine
thread with that discussion, but as you can imagine, I'm understandably
curious.)

Our next fine example of appearing to answer the question/point without
doing so. You're still just focusing on *ONLY* the loot like some sort
of powergamer. ST wasn't put in there simply for primal, or SoD's, or
Monkey cloaks, IMO. It was put in as the pre-Luclin ULTIMATE challenge
of the Norrath, and the only time players could change the world around
them in a permanent way and affect the storyline on their server. Yes,
you can kill the warders without waking the sleeper. But then you
haven't really "beaten" the zone, have you?

Apparently the will wasn't there on your server, nor will it be on Xev,
nor was it on Zeb or Drinal, or ............ I'll take your word that
there is some sort of truce on a couple servers where a couple
uberguilds have agreed not to wake the Sleeper. Now show me the
insurance policy that says that once they've got all their gear and some
more Tier 2 guilds who they may not like as much start getting ST keys,
that this situtation won't change. You are describing a Utopia which,
IMO, does not exist in our virtual world. And you are also making a
pompous, arrogant statement that you have judged the action as "Immoral"
etc. if any guild decides to beat that zone. The big reward in Sleepers
isn't just the loot. (more on that below, again.)

And I see lots of horses around. Why? Does it give you any serious
advantage in combat, or speed, or getting uberloot? No. But it's fun,
and a lot of people wanted horses and thought it was in character for
their mighty Paladin to be riding about on his noble steed. It's a
reward. Just not a powergamer loot reward.

It's my understanding that this is not true, and that this report is the
twisting of a statement made by a GM in Chat, not in game, but that
could be wrong. If more details have come out, please stick in a
pointer. I'm very interested in the progress of Stormhammer. I find it
fascinating.

As to Verant going back on things...... well *DUH*. One word: Conquest.
And in the vernacular of the unwashed, "... 'nuff said."

Stopping. Guarding with my life, oh splendid one.

> What is the reward for waking the Sleeper? 

I'm going to go into this with you, just for the purpose of being
thorough regarding your purely argumentative questions below on this
subject. But I will venture to say right here at the start that even
*YOU* don't believe that horseshit 100%, but rather are spouting it to
try to back up your point. And the only purpose of the point is to try
to add some rationalization to the boohooism being displayed over the
fact that you're now in an ST capable (or soon to be) guild and the
Sleeper is already gone. Just my opinion, of course, but I certainly
can't see any other reason for this rash departure from seeing what
would normally be obvious.

> Quantify it - is it loot? No, you get more from leaving the Warders  alive. 

No. And you already know this as well as I, but it wouldn't serve your
argument to acknowledge it. But let's beat this dead equine a bit more
anyway. No, James, there is no loot associated with waking the sleeper
because he can't be killed, and you could keep pharming warders, and
blah, blah, blah, blah...

> Is it status? No, 

This is where you totally fall off the logic beam. You're damned right
it's status, but it's status and pride in *YOURSELVES* and your *OWN*
accomplishements. Not the shallow praise, or lack thereof, from the
boohooists or even your admirers.  It's the pride in yourselves. But
let's let you finish this quickly derailing train of thought first.

> on just about every server where the script went off people show disdain > to outright hatred of the guild that did it. 

Human nature is tough to beat. They wish they could have done it, or
that the primal pharming would be easier if/when they get there. (And
remember, we're talking about less than 5% of the total EQ population,
no matter how high level they get, that will EVER be able to step foot
in ST.) The rest are far deeper in the boohooist camp, as they are
bitching about something that would never affect them.

It's one factor, though far from the primary one. And all of the angels
in here who have started condemning me for recognizing human nature may
feel free to stop reading and log off and go back to their full time
volunteer positions serving soup at the homeless shelters. There is
competition between guilds in many cases. There are also alliances. You
help your allies and you do nothing to help your competitors. Granted,
you normally can't do anything to keep your competitors down beyond
making them wait longer for something by beating them to a long delay
spawn. But this would be the one that the losers in that race will
REALLY start to whinge about.

But mostly, no. The true Brass Ring here (and you damn well know this
already) is knowing that your guild was the one who was able to
dismantle the toughest task VI put into the game. That you were the one
who launched and got to witness the script that can only run ONE time
per server. That you saw the Sleeper, awake in all his glory (though it
was only briefly while he was stomping you into a puddle). THAT, my
cantankerous friend, is the real Brass Ring of waking the Sleeper. But
again, I am 100% confident you already knew that, but don't care to
discuss it because it casts the boohooists in the light of jealousy and
poor sportsmanship.

I'm still not convinced that the implementation of ST was entirely
"bad", though in hindsight improvements could be made, and may *still*
be made. And I'm all in favor of more world changing event type content.
But again, your blaming of the guilds for exploring that content and
solving it holds no water in my book beyond simple sour grapes.

So, again, the key phrase would be "around the time the top guilds don't
want it anymore". Hrmmm.... interesting. So in your case, you have a
nice, civilized little "rotation" with another guild or two, do you?
That's very gentlemanly. And if more guilds grow big enough to grab
those, you'll invite them into your little "rotation", will you?
BUT..... when you don't want it anymore, it will go FFA. 

I see.

I'm sure the mid thirties guilds who might just be getting up to the
point of trying that spawn when you are "done with it and it goes FFA"
will be errecting statues in honor of your fairness and compassion.
Hypocricy, plain and simple. A rotation that benefits you and anyone you
have to deal with on the same level is fine. Those below are not worthy
of consideration and can settle for FFA later on, and those above you
who took something you couldn't achieve are all greedy bastards who are
"ruining the game."  Got it. Check.

Yes, we really MUST discuss this. I am, frankly, distracted from my
daily tasks in anticipation of this topic. But again, I'd hate to tie up
the sleeper thread with it. However, I must make time at lunch to figure
out once again how to use Google and go start compiling your posts from
our whole last discussion on guilds. ;-)
