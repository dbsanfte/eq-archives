sounds good to me. the reason i ask is because i like the idea of a nice,
peaceful bard, but i also like my evil necromancer, so i could not decide
whether to delete my necro and start a bard, or to just play my necro until
i got tired of it, then start a bard.  but now that i know i can rp on other
servers, i can just create a new character and keep my necro!  thanks for
the help.
