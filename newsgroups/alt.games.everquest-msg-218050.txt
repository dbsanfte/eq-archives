I admit, my game husband and i had fun pre-luclin, and just after luclin 
came out...we would sit and talk while waiting for mana, or the boat, or 
the spires[neither of us felt like druid/caster bamfings] and we ran a 
lot of places. The rate of play was more relaxed, and we had 'quality' 
time type conversations. PoP came out, and all of a sudden we never 
seemed to have time to sit and virtual-snuggle and talk about food, 
music, movies / whatever. i was the more relaxed player, i liked the 
downtime of waiting for mana, the spires/boat...he wanted to make the 
xp, or the tradeskill loot. We had difficulties for a couple months 
until we reached a happy medium, and we have fun playing now, we make 
time for in game talking and hanging out together [he is in germany and 
i am in the us, so we can really only spend time together online...makes 
having a friendsip something you have to work at.]
