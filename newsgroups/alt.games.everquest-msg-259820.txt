My son learned to read on EQ, watching me play, and then playing from my 
lap, but didn't get his own character till 3 or so... thats when reading 
really took off for him; there's nothing like -having- to read and type 
in order to communicate to really get a kid moving in the right direction.

Same theory as total immersion in spanish or any other language I suppose.

Only thing is, English is such a STUPID written language, it was almost 
impossible to teach... I think its just as bad spoken, really, but you 
learn it subliminally.  Turns out written english can be done the same way.

I've been quite pleased with the results.
