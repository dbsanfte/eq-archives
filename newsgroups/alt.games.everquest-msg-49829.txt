It is not an easy answer. I have played both, but have settled on EQ because
it
fits into my schedule and play style better. Both are good games, and both
have
plusses and minuses to them.
Just a few pluses:
    EQ
      +3d world - good graphics. You can play the game from 1st person, and
        the world it is in is very attractive.
      +Choice of Class - Class/level based advancement and skills help you
to
        define your character.
      +STRONG Community - The game has great ingame chat options and
        built in matching ability. (you can always do a /who LFG to find out
who
        is looking for groups.
      +Many quests in game - some of them are short (20 minutes or so) and
        some of them are long (EPIC in length weeks can be devoted to them)
      +Good control of PVP (player vs player) - seperate PVP servers exist
        as well as the option to /duel someone (temporary PVP vs 1 person)
        also ingame guilds with decent guild chat and limited roleplaying
ability.
        (Guildwars. they dont use them much, but they are available.)

    UO
      +3/4 view allows for more of a strategic feel to the game. for non-1st
        person view it is an attractive world.
      +Classless gameplay - start out a fighter, decide to dabble in magic,
        maybe take up a bit of musical skills and round yourself out by be-
        coming a master chef!
      +STRONG out of game community - The world of Ultima has existed
        since almost the beginning of time (computer gaming time, that is)
and
        the community knows how things work. There is a lot of in game story
        telling being done (you can even write your own books!)
      +More of a PVP style of game. Some control was enabled by Origions
        when the players demanded it, but PVP is still easier to get into
than
        in EQ.
      +Obnoxious level of detail - Want to bake bread? you can... Want to
        re-arrange furniture? you can... Want to own a house? You can (not
        easily, but you can)... Want to ride a horse? or even train a wild
dragon?
        or maybe build a table and chairs? maybe you would like to brew
potions
        or ..... well, you get the idea.   some of this can be done in EQ
also, but not
        with the level of detail that UO has.

As you can see, they are different games.  EQ supports the "munchkin"
community
better by allowing for LOTS more dungeon crawling and hunting. The quests
can
be awsome to do if you choose, but you can also spend week after week just
hunting
for the next creature.  UO allows for more "real-life" pursuits. I supported
myself
baking bread and soon made enough to actually buy a sword! another 5000
loaves
and I might have been able to afford that helmet I had my eye on! hehe
Actually you
can get things easier than that, and it does NOT come down to a game that
you spend
all your time doing mundane things.... unless you want to.

Both games support the free 1st month, and I suggest you try them first.
Decide which
style of play you wish, and choose from there.
