Okay, that song ending stuff, havn't seen it sence about level 2.  Got
very tired of it and went and turned it off in the chat part of the
options menu. Just worry about the icons, if they show up the song is
working.  As for weaving three is reasonable, and if a really bad lag
day two.  The missed notes go away after awhile, but I have noticed
that if it is really laggy then they increase.  Also try and keep your
clicks smooth.  I mean don't dubble click really fast, I have noticed
an increase in missed notes if you do that.  Also if you are getting a
whole bunch of missed notes in a row take a deep breath before
clicking the song again.  I have noticed that if you keep trying to
get the song going with missed notes it will just keep happening until
you give it a second inbetween.
