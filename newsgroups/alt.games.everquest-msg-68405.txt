    384 is a odd amount everything should be multiple of 2, : 16, 32, 64,
128, 256, 512. there is the in-between like some people have a 128MB and a
64Mb for 192Mb. 256+128=384.

Having 384 MB is nothing more than the result of having 3 sticks that are
128MB each.

This is the amount of RAM in my machine, has been since I built it, and have
had no issues, except that playing SOL has made me painfully aware that the
good ol' AMD K6-3 450 is not gonna cut it anymore:)
