Ok, so people have adjusted to the inaccuracies, and often blatantly
wrong consider messages. And yer point? 

Sounds suspiciously like you're saying "You don't know the secret, so
its your fault". 

Kinda reminds me of the carnival...shooting galleries on the midway?
Supposedly the rifle sights were way off, and hardly anyone can hit
the targets. However, the carny running the game always seems to hit.
Obviously because he has knowledge you don't. I.e. whats wrong with
the sights and how to correct for it. 

But according to you, thats a fair setup, right? 

Its *your* fault that you don't know the special rules governing con
messages. 

Well, hell...thanks for clearing that right up. 

LOL
