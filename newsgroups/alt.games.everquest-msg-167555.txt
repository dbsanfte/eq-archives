As a shaman, I can tell you that finding groups is rarely a problem.  If I
turn LFG on prior to a raid, I often get tells from someone somewhere in EQ
asking if I'd like to come to wherever the hell they are.  At level 57, I
would go to PoT, turn LFG on, not say a word, and within a couple of minutes
I would generally have a couple of people asking me to come join their group
in one of the first tier planes.  As for soloing, shaman are not the best,
but are damned good at it.
