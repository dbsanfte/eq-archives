As far as I know, archery breaks root never; just like melee damage. 
The only thing that breaks root is DD.  If you have DOTs which don't 
have a DD component then they won't break root either, nor will 
malaise/tash/slow or other debuffs with no DD component. 
Druid/Ranger/Zerker snare won't break root, but I think Necro/SK snare 
will (not certain, if they only do DOT damage but no initial DD they won't)

When I say "breaks root" I mean "gives mob an additional chance to break 
root" of course, no spell automatically breaks root every time.

I also think you are incorrect about amount of damage; I believe that 
any DD has the same shot as any other, that all the DD does is allow the 
mob an extra chance to break the root on his own.

A practical use of this principle is to cast a tiny nuke on yourself if 
you end up rooted by a mob; usually it only takes a couple tries to 
break yourself free.

Root also periodically allows the mob to check to see if he can break 
it; and I think that this is a magic resist check, so anything you can 
do to debuff his MR will decrease his chances of breaking root.

You probably have more than one line of root; some roots are fast 
casting and short duration, some are slow casting and long lasting.  For 
root rotting you may find the long lasting ones work better, because 
they seem to give the mob less frequent opportunities to break root on 
his own.  But you may find the short ones more use if you are actually 
casting DDs (even DOTs with DD component), because they are reapplied 
faster and cost less mana.

Up until somewhere in his 60s my cleric used his cheapest lowest level 
root almost exclusively when soloing, because much of his damage came 
from DD; he'd only cast the long duration root when doing CC with it.
