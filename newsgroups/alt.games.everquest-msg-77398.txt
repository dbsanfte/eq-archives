Yeah, I realise it was way too verbose...

I suspected as much. All the reports of raids had people yelling `camp'
rather than evac when things turned sour.

At this point it's mostly about aim and intent. If the guild makes it
an aim to be raid capable and encourages the vital classes within its
ranks / recruitment then it might happen. If not the more power oriented
people tend to feel forced to move to a more powerful guild with an
the experience and capability to do raids. And, of course, the first
people to go are those in demand such as clerics and warriors...

Everything i've seen suggests that what seem to be the core classes,
warriors, clerics, enchanters are extremely group dependant in their
development. If we could make it clear we value, and will assist, such
people it would seem they'll be more likely to grow with the guild.

Interesting insights into the social aspects of a guild as well. The
personality of this guild, which is very young, is still developing.
It's incredibly unlikely they'll become an uber-guild which is fine
by me. However without some ability to help with epic quests and
occassional loot they will find it difficult to develop any high
end presence at all....at which point they become a training guild
for others (which ain't actually a disaster either :)
