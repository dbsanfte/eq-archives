Heh. That reminds me why I used to have a "no camo" policy for ports to 
Iceclad. I hated it when my customer ran away invisible while I was eaten 
alive by snow dervishes. Eventually it was "no, sorry, if you are man 
enough to go to Iceclad, you can help me with whatever jumps us".

I agree there. I guess many people use the word "donation" not as a "get 
out of paying a fair price" card, but because it sounds more RP'ish than 
"cold, hard cash".
