You didn't miss much.  I know some disagree but IMO LOY was just about
the worst expansion.  A few zones are good for grinding at lower
levels, that's about it.

POP spells are indeed a lot cheaper than they were a few years ago.
Only way I know is to have a list of the spell names or search for all
by class and richt-click on the ones you aren't sure about.  Keep in
mind that you can now research GoD spells.  Were those runes droppable
on FV?

Since they just opened the Guild Lobby, you don't have to worry about
corpse recoveries ever again.  Just pay your 170ish plat and have it
summoned to you across zones.

Try OoW zones.  At your level try Noble's Causeway, Wall of Slaughter,
and Muramite Proving Ground.  Once you get the expansions, try some
monster missions.

You can skip a lot of PoP content now by being gimped (85/15 rule) in
to the highest-end zones and doing a quest for access...or something
like that.  You can also get in to Sol Ro now with a stupidly-easy,
soloable quest.  And in any case, PoP zones just aren't that popular.
You get experience plus loot (spell rune drops in particular) in OoW
zones.

The game has become a lot more friendly toward non-raiders.
