Eh, been to an assortment or two of rallies.  You know those people you 
simply cannot bring yourself to associate with?  From my point of view, 
they're usually the featured speakers.

The part that does not seem true to me:  Part and parcel of what Sanjian 
is saying is that it is inherently good to pick a campfire so that you can 
explain your views to people by saying, "I'm at that campfire there."  I 
do not feel that that convenience is worth the error introduced into any 
description of my views.

Exactly.  No thanks.  I'll just go vote my conscience instead. :)
