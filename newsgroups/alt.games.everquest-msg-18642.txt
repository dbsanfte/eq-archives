Easiest one is the Fishbone Earring, droped by a barbarian fisherman in
Qeynos hills, by the small pond.  He spawns every 6 hours and drops the
earring one in six times.  He is heavily camped but the earring is a
constant EB, does not need to be activated and can't be dispelled.  Avg
price 1.5K, min 800pp, max 3K.  Some people may disagree with me and say Avg
1K, but this is my experience.  I have one and I have been offered some
pretty rediculous things for it, (molten cloak, Jaundice arms, Jaundice
gloves).  Good luck and expect a long camp.
