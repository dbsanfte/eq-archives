The best gift you can give to any low level twink is a pair of velium fire
opal rings (6AC, 65HP).  I usually give mine gold (4/45) 'cause I don't have
the cash you do.

Enchanters don't need much CHA until mid-teens.  Don't be too chintzy on
starting stats but don't go overboard on CHA either.  Enchanters get a CHA
buff fairly early.

1-15, HP & INT
16-50 INT & CHA
51+ HP, INT & CHA

Don't PL your enchanter much or he will suck.
