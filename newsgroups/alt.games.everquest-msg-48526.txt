It is common knowledge that Biz has 2 KFs, one that expires every 30
days, and one for serious morons,  I'm guessing you just expired out of

KF to expire.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when

aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
