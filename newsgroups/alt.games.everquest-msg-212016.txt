enchanter's visage line can add agro and reduce aggro on the target (plus we
get an extra line [i like saying 'extra line' because it's fancy sounding,
but really it's just a spell or two....or just one..boggle...okay, i forgot
if there's another...this is quite a bad tangeant] of self-only aggro
reduction)

SOMEONE CALCULATE THAT FANCY IDEAL SITUATION =p

or just say "500 dps" and i'll be so happy

(aren't there like 5 people on this ng that jump at the chance to squeeze
the numbers? where are they? someoen go wake them up)
