I think the tutorial doesnt work any more, Im not sure about that though.
You are better off just reading the manual and getting right in there. Its
an online game, so there are other people to ask.

It wont affect your account at all, you can even log in from your mate's (or
whoever's) PC and access your characters.

If you are just starting out, it wont affect you at all, unless you want to
play an Iksar or Vah Shir character. If you want to start playing ASAP, just
log in and start any other race of character. You can download the patches
at a later date.
