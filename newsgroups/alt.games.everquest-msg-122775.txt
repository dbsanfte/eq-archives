However, there's another step you can use to "test" the vendor
to see if he *does* have any of the item you want...

1.  Right-click on the vendor to open the buy/sell window.

2.  Buy him out of some cheapo item until an empty slot
    shows where that item used to be.

3.  *Sell* him one of the items you'd like more of.

4A.  If the item you just sold shows up in the empty slot
     you just created, he has none of that item himself.
     Buy back the item you just sold him and go try another
     vendor.

4B.  If, on the other hand, the item you just sold does
     *not* show up in the empty slot -- if the empty slot
     is still empty -- then it means that he *does* have
     more of that item and the item you just sold went on
     his existing "stack" of items somewhere off the bottom
     of his visible inventory.  So now you close the trade
     window, reopen it, and begin the "bleed him dry" routine
     you described until his stack of "item X" shows up
     in his visible inventory and you can buy all of them
     from him.
