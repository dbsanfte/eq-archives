Okay it was kind of hard to make much sense of that but I think you
are saying that the new skelly model was disappointing to you and you
think doing the texture upgrade on old areas will make all the mobs
like that? It doesn't.

The texture upgrade only upgrades the enviornmental (scenery)
textures, NOT MOBS. So the ground is a bigger more detailed texture as
are buildings and such. Mostly this just accomplishes lagging you more
in old world areas especially ones like freeport where clipping
strangely does not work.
