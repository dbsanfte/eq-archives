i recently went back to GD, and CC, all the mobs there, and npc's were
the 'stock human, bald SOB' form-when i play on one of the origional
coninents ie; in oasis-all mobs ok-So i deleted all the .txc files
(this worked once before for wierd wolves colors)-but it didnt work
this time-still with the bald fucks as a vellium crawler-someone
suggested deleating the eqclient ini file-that did not work-also
noticed something strange about the opening server patch 'advanced'
section when i redid the full scan, pick extra option--, i think since
yshika(or whateverthefuckitis) stuff started(and i did accept it) i
noticed i only had an  option for extra files
(orwhaterverthefuckitiscalled) for legends, lucin and pop-nothing for
kunark or velounious(i have trilogy)-thats diferent isn't it??-i seem
to member each of the major expantions having thier own ticky
box-anyway-anyone else having this trouble?-all was fine and dandy
before-oh yes, 1 last tidbit-i can fight, cast,move well in
velunious-but its really hard to target or loot a dead mob that i've
killed-a wierd little detail-again, no prob when i'm in oasis-
---my puter shuld'nt matter, but just in case-ati radion 9500pro(128),
