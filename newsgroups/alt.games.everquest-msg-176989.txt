I just placed a bet for $1000 on the Raiders winning by over 3.5 points
tommorow, I could use the money to help pay my legal bills so that I can
continue God's work so I know that I will win the money.

anyway if you decide to bet on this game, here are some rules you should
follow

1)Don't bet on any other games this year, or you will become addicted and
lose all your money.

2)Don't bet to become wildly rich or you will eventually lose and lose all
your money.

3)Bet just enough to get what you need and don't be greedy, but don't be
afraid to take a big risk occasionally when you think you have a decent
chance of winning(like now)

Why is God encouraging me to gamble on football games? Isn't that something
a gangster or a criminal would do?

No, it's because the stock market has gone down for 3 years straight and
business leaders walk out of their companies regularly with all the
stockholder's investments. Right now I would rather invest my money with
Russian gangsters than most of America's business leaders, the gangsters at
least practice something called honor.
