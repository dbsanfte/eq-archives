I couldnt agree more. Little things in life annoy people, dont see why EQ
should be any different. If begging was something you came across once in a
while instead of frequently im sure people would moan less about it, same with
the other minor irritations. Its not about more 'Prozac in their diet' its just
people saying I dont like this and im gonna tell you i dont like it.
