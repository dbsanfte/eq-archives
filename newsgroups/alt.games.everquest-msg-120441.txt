Exactly. We've had better than a half dozen of my guildies in a mad rush
to max out their smithing as far as they could before today's patch.
(One guy even has a "smittie" alt he made only last week and hit 242
last night. Is doing cultural armor now.

The happiness is only if you are already at those levels and want to
make something of a lower trivial level like plate, etc. for whatever
reason. Before you could get up to 175 smithing pretty damned cheaply
just doing banded. Hell, I even got my stupid troll there in a few
sessions. Now, that will trivial far sooner and you'll have to go on the
endless quest for spiderling silks and LQ pelts to make FS Plate just to
make it to 175. Trust me. This is a nightmare. If you were *planning* on
taking up smithing, you won't be a happy camper at all.
