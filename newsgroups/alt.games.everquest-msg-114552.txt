When you lost your virginity, did you tell your friends?  When you got a
raise, did you tell your friends?  When your girlfriend said she would marry
you, did you tell everyone?  I'm hoping at least one of these has happened
to you so that you know what I'm talking about.

EQ is a social game and as such when good things happen to people they like
to share them with everyone.  Normally there is the shout of DING, then a
few Gratz and then the fanfare is over and game continues.  But for the
person that just leveled they feel really good for a moment and it didn't
hurt anyone.  So why does this bother you.  "Poor is the man who's delight
is in the displeasure of others," my uncle used to say all the time.  I
guess I could add, "Even more poor is the man who's pain is in the pleasure
of others."
