Unless the changes to spell interruption (duck=instant interrupt)
changed the way interrupts work regarding other movement there is
another way to cast while moving.  Previous to those modifications it
was possible to begin casting a spell, move x,y coords and finish the
spell if you returned to the approximate location you started in time
for the end of the spell.  Approximate rather than exact because you can
channel the spell if you are close.  Hard to do on a quick cast but
complete heals and group teleports allow a lot of running time between
cast and completion.  Again, if interrupt changes changed this as well I
do not know, haven't tried this in a while.
