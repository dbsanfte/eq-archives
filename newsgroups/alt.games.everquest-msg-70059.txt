Can I just say now that I hate you guys, so very very much.  OK, now
that that is out of the way, my log parser for 45-56 (when I wasn't
playing on my laptop) shows 169 deaths, though 47 of those were in
level 55 while we were learning ToV.  I rarely die unless I'm raiding
though, out of my 11 deaths listed in my logs in level 59, I do see
one soloing death (trying both CS named with no mana to charm), 3 ToV
deaths (we were sloppy and had a bunch of guests), one VS death (I
didn't die, must be an error in the program), 4 deaths exploring
Luclin, one death due to stupidity and wrong turns on the way to KC
basement, and 1 death from jumping in The Hole to help kill Master
Yael.  That's all in one yellow bubble of 59.
I used to think that not dying meant something, then I realized that
the only way to not die is to only hunt boring zones right at the zone
line and run at the first hint of trouble.  

Arolpin
usually has Aego wear off though
