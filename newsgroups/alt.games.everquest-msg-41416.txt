ya that sucks, it happend to my girlfriend when i give her twink equipment,
i ask her do you have a free slot for a bag ? yes yes, she answered. Trade.
bad on the floor, no more bags on the floor ...

It really sucks, when auctionning in EC, turn the fast drop to OFF !!

Lot of people puts bags in trade full of goodies. I saw guys straffing on
the left, hopping the bag drops on the floor instead of open the trade
window.

No world is perfect ...
