Take your pick:

1. It hasn't caused enough problems for them to think it is worth an
hour or so of Rowyl's time to fix it.

2. They don't realize the check could be done entirely in the client
by Rowyl, and so they think it would take a long time or use too many
server resources.

3. People dropping things during trades, which then get scavanged by
nearby NPCs, provides a much-needed money sink for the EQ economy, so
they consider this a feature. :-)
