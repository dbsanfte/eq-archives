If you have the Velious expansion (not sure if this
works without - only tried it after I got Velious) you
can change the color and transparency of the chat
window with the /wincolor command.

Type /wincolor by itself and you'll get a message
on usage.

A non-transparent background helps tremendously,
as the color stays the same no matter what terrain
you're in.
