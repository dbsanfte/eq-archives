    In SoL we'll apparently be able to set ourselves up as NPC vendors in
The Bazaar zone, to sell stuff while offline?/AFK. Until I see that nobody
can tamper with me (like, say, killing NPC vendors to see what happens to
them), I won't trust it, but if secure it might be exactly what we're
looking for.

    My server (Quellious) has several "professional sellers" (Dabobo,
Tsuken, Tigerstyle), and a few guild sales mules (Manarain, Ciff) that do
very little other than sell in EC. You know you're dealing with a
professional seller when they have Singing Steel BPs for sale and you know
they have no bard alts.

    I did that for a friend once to clear his bank account. He was just an
obscene packrat, and had well over 100 items worth selling in EC rather than
to a vendor. He was amazed at how much cash I made him from all those sales.
I'm doing a "collected trash from eight characters" sale now, and it's
financed a TON of twink gear to go back on those same eight characters (and
at least two robes for my rogue's epic).
