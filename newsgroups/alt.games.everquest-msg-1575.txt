Nope can't pick pets or PCs.
Best to practice while using another taunt skill in battle
i.e. Backstab. /doability BS
                    attack off
                    /pause 1,/doability PP
                   /pause 1,/doability BEG/Disarm/rude(heh)
                   attack on

Note how PP works with loot. You can never take the last coin of any type
and always split it. If the Mob has 3gp 3s3c. And you pick 1 GP. the Mob has
1gp3sp3cp then you pick 1sp. Mob has 1gp1sp3cp..

Note the 1gp1sp goes poof no one gets it..

Soooo. Practice and Mobs with no cash loot such as Sarnaks. PPing Giants
just lowers the loot for everyone..Practice PP is really only useful to do
PP quests..

Group etiquette. A) Just do it then split or ask then split.
If you have 60 silver do / split 0 0 60 0 in 6man grp. they will ask what
you are doing.
just say its your pp loot. The monk will say stop splitting. No one else
will care. and soon enough you all will be drooping the silver on the coin
to rot. Give the Gems to the clerics. Give the pages to the casters even if
they don't need em. Many casters are sitting medding instead of looting.

Get a rep stay grouped.
Doh verbal diarrhea
