Oh I never claimed to be intimately familiar with EverQuest.  On the
contrary, I readily admit, and have so repeatedly in other discussion
threads, that I am quite new to EverQuest.  I do, however, have a great
deal of familiarity with gaming in general, having played such games as
D&D, AD&D, GURPS, ShadowRun, MechWarrior, EarthDawn, D20, and to a
lesser extent, RIFTS and MekTon.  And though EverQuest has, to date,
been the truest adaptation of a classic RPG system in FPS MMO I've
personally seen to date, my observations of the mentioned issues up
through to and including lvl 43 (highest lvl char I have seen from the
playing side) hold quite true.  It is also my understanding that above
level 65, many of the games mechanics fall apart, with more than just
the economy to worry about.  However, having no first-hand experience
with this, I do not feel qualified to comment.

I will, however, say that the game is more than just level 70.

Indeed.  And other items dropped by the mobs, not readily placed into
your coin-slots, are you telling me these items do not also bring in
excessive ammounts of coin?  If so, then that would be somewhat of a
reliefe, but would still in no way invalidate my statements in so far
as my own experience has shown, nor would it readily offset the
unbalanced coin:level ratio, given how rapidly plat becomes available,
either through direct coin drops or re-selling of dropped goods to
venders or other players.

If, however, these mobs you speak of do drop re-sellable items, and
these items sell for anything at or more than the 100 to 1K plat/day
I'm seeing at lvl 43, then I would recommend a course in ecenomics
before any more rash statements about speaking of things which are not
known /:)

No, even if the upper mobs don't drop a single coin or useful, sellable
item, I fail to see how this invalidates statements about the EQ
economy being severely broken.

As a completely off-topic aside, I would just like to say that the
T'Skrang were the BEST lizardman race EVER, ANYWHERE. :) If only
because I've never seen T'Skrang and Iksar mentioned in the same
sentance.
