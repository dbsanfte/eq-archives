Oggok.  Nobody ever hunts there, but it's a great hunting zone.  If you can
sneak you can also sell your loot to a vendor right at zonein.  Overthere is
another good zone, though forget about loot there.  And nobody ever hunts in
Firiona Vie, but it's not too bad of a zone as long as you stick to the
edges.  Lots of other choices, those are just some of my faves that seldom
get overpopulated.

Earth pet has the most hp.  You already said that doesn't matter with the
buffs (and you're right).  Air pet will get hit the least, so will generally
tank as well as the beefier earth pet.  That means less DS damage though. 
Fire pet has the least hp, but again with cleric buffs that probably doesn't
matter much.  The innate DS on the fire pet with a cleric backing it up
should make it a pretty nasty pet.
