Nah, cause someone like me buying out npc merchants would sell the
silk below either of them in the bazaar. There really is no way to run
schemes there, someone always comes along and sells at outrageously
low prices.

I was using /bazaar and searched centi.
I saw centi longsword for 600 plat to 2200 plat, on the trib server..
with a range of 12 player vendors. Gee.. which am I going to buy?
Sometimes I wonder if the 2200 person is the first one or just stupid
or just lazy. 600 would be a good price on trib I think.
