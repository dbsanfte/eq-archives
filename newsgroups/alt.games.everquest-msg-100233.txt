 Top posting is replying to a question by putting your text at the top of the
message. 
 Providing you include enough information in your post, it, in itself is not a
bad thing, however, not everybody can or will do so, e.g 1 line replies to a 50
line post is often common, therefore its considered by many to be more polite
to put your answer at the bottom of the post so that people may read what it is
you're replying to with out have to rescroll through the message a dozen times.

 Kind of like the way a normal (face to face) conversation would take place:
Question then answer. 
Statement then reply.

 It also helps when people have a slow newsreader and may not yet have read the
original post or the posts have come through in non-consecutive order.

 What you have to accomplish is the task of making as many people read your
post as possible so that you may get the best responses. If people find your
posting method annoying they will just ignore the message totally.

Hope i've been of help, and remember no matter what you do someone, somewhere
is bound to disagree.

I don't care what is written about me so long as it isn't true.
