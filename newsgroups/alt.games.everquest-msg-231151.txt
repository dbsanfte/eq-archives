Congrats! For a long time DC was an awsome spell to have, unfortunatly
it's less so these days but still great fun :)

It is a regular spell so can be resisted, however I don't recall
having DC resisted as such.  There are pleanty of un charmable mobs
out there though.  Did it say timer was reset?  If so the mob is
flagged uncharmable

Most of the time melee mobs are a better bet than caster ones.  The
best are those that will dual wield - they put down a lot more DPS
than casters.  If your worried about it's health use mez on the target
mob to control damage your guy takes & even rune on your pet.

I think it will just poof when you charm the chanter.  If not its not
going to cause you a lot of trouble!

I've never know one do so.

Caster pets are not highly thought of as thier DPS is generally lower
than pure melee, as is thier AC & HP.  They can also be interupted
just as you can be & all the time they are casting they arn't doing
any damage.  The best option is for a melee pet & equip him with some
weaponry that will improve his damage on top of haste & ac buffs (I
like to NDT mine too - increases atk rating & dex by a decent amount).
 Spend a little time farming in SK or Spitpaw for whips that proc
snare.  These are one of the favourite pet weapons & pretty easy to
come by.  I generally keep a few bits on me for pets - I have a few
velious things atm from a farming session for a friend working on his
shawl.  They proc a small DD which helps a little!
