Magic weapons are available at level one, from other level one characters.
The class you are looking for is a mage, who can summon a progression
of magical weapons from the very first level.

The fact that most people have elected to instead save up and purchase
-better- magical weapons, which are not "no rent" does not mean that
it is impossible to do this sort of thing without doing so.   Just group with
a mage and you can happily kill things that cannot be hit without magic
weapons at levels much lower than 22... in fact the wily will-o-wisp's
that are so aggressively hunted at levels under 10 are killable with those
tools.

The fact that maturing servers make a mockery out of the items a mage
can supply is an unfortunate fact, things like this that once put the
mage in a comfortable position in groups as a summoned item supplier
have now left him with a vast array of almost useless spells.

Of course worse still are the cleric's summoned weapon line, which
are not only no rent and relatively junky, but NO DROP as well!
