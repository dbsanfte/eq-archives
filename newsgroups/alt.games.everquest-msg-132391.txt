Flirting can be fun. I like to feel attractive, and I like to role-play. But
at the end of the day, I know who I'm really snuggling with. So while Tiru
(male dwarven cleric) may profess his undying affections for Tylana (typical
wood elf druid) in game (or even funnier, for a female human wizzie who is
in real life a gay male), I enjoy walking by my sweetie and kissing him when
I go to refil my glass. If he actually started acting jealous of it, I think
I'd get upset. He should only worry when I start making plans to meet one of
my regular flirts offline... and without him.
