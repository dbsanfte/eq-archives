First and foremost...MANY THANKS!! to .."Palindrome..Faeander...Don 
Woods...Murdock..Pris Flynn...and...Wrat(for the personal email) ..for 
taking the time to respond to my inquiry/ dilemma. Its responses from 
knowledgeable sources as yourself that make "newsgroups"  such a great 
exchange!
Since there was such an"overlap" of ideas/suggestion,I will presume"great 
minds think alike"...second part ,of the statement, does not apply!!!lol

1) Returned to Moon..found way to guild hall(funeral home!)..did appropriate 
inquiries...apparently was "too late' and previous experiences could not be 
returned. In retrospect,don,t believe I had accumulated any "exp",since I 
was fighting "green"! Under the impression that "green=go".."red=
stop" and blue was for more "determined" players!

2) There were "available character slots" and created a new "beastlord" 
complete with tutorials.
 Am now a level 8...personal game knowledge is increasing...

3)  Back to original "beastlord"...Found bazaar,now there,s a Wal-mart!!.... 
used /ooc command again obtained local help with buying ." Summoned: " as 
instructed ,and made purchases for the
"wolf"..mowed lawn..returned to game..."purchases disappeared"....have been 
enlightened!!

4) Returned to "various game links" provided by yourselves....oh my!! This 
game is "huge" and all "encompassing"... Don Woods "faq" is 
excellent..."congrats"..lol!

5) Previous post, I had related the incident about the  /shout "looking for 
help" when all of this went bad. I was on the moon (POK,getting smarter!) at 
the time and wondering if the lack of response,was in retrospect,related to 
my "current level". Surrounding players may have though it  was a joke...I 
hope,

6) Suffering "game burnout" after the lengthy time I was online this weekend 
and taking a few days off..

7) Again "any many thanks"for all your advice/input it was greatly 
appreciated!!

8) will keep you posted on the continuing travels of the "old man and his 
dog"
ps...found that I own a horse too!

regards..Peter Wolfe
