It seems to me that you use the Chimp almost exclusively for soloing
outdoors. If you plan on doing anything indoors in the near future,
RS1 & 2 are still your best options. You will eat a lot less death if
you can make it back to the Gimp before that MOb you just pulled with
a resisted Darkness does.

One of the *huge* advantages of being an Iksar Necromancer was always
the racial regen. Qiin's 4th, 5th, and 6th AA point will go into MORE
regen to slow the deleterious effects of Lich.

You can't meditate while bandaging wounds. If you're not meditating,
you will find that laying a Bond of Death on your enemies is a much
more effective method of healing than Bind Wounds will ever be.
