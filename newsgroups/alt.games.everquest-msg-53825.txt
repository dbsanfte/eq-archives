I'm sure you can buy this one somewhere in the freeport tunnels. You
might be able to buy it in neriak also.

All the time. Don't worry about your health dropping a lot, you just get
it back with lifetaps in the next fight - we must be the only class that
drops health between fights and gains it during them.

I never found it at all useful. There seem to be much better ways to
fight.

I did those levels in lavastorm, but Kurn's would be good too. Fairly safe
to get too with invisability, just make sure to go to Kunark via the
overthere
and not Firiona vie.
