Speaking as another "I'm so sick of LoIO I could puke" type, I'll suggest High
Hold Keep. I'm working on getting my second character in there now. Nice change
of pace, fast action, and good xp/loot.  Of course, as a lizzy type, you're
going to have a lot of faction work ahead of you to get in there, but it might
be worth it.
