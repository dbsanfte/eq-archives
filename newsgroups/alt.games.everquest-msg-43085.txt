Didn't see anything about rangers getting triple attacks, monks having it is
good. Think rangers having it as well will put them too far above the other
hybrids.
I guess all this is trying to make the other classes (Hybrids mainly) useful
in the end game where people state only Warriors and Clerics as essential
classes.

To tell the truth, it'll not make much odds to me (unless one of the
improvements to Two Handed weapons adjusts Felhammer in someway) I don't see
me ever making 50 now. No longer able to find a pick up group, of course I
could if I wanted to wait long enough but sitting around for 30 mins to 2hrs
doing nothing but waiting does not appeal to me.

Seems a bit late in the day to start implementing these changes, after all
their bad guys have been slain. I suppose it takes a while to colate all the
info and statistics to prove that what they have done doesn't meet their
needs (not sure that playings complaining has any effect on verants
decisions when it comes to game play)

CF
Still wish melee classes could bandage to 75% health, but that's just me
wanting to be able to solo, still.
