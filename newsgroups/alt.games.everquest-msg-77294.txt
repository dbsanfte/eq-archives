Hope I didn't miss the point of your post... but your asking how to form the
groups on a raid?

The way my guild works (were not uber, but we can take down all 3 velious
kings/lords on the first pull, sont, zland/kland, sleepers tomb named etc)
really only concentrates on the essential people who NEED to be grouped.

By that I mean the rotation clerics and tanks,  because against a mob like
Vindi, and Tormax etc, if your not a maink tank, you DONT need a healer.
Basically if its main tankable, every other group doesn't matter.. just
control your agro (monks fd, rogues evade, rangers jolt etc etc)

Even if you had a cleric in group.. if you take agro from Vindi or Statue
you would be dead before you could get a heal anyway, and if your MA can't
hold agro on a fight like that... you don't win

If it has an AE, then each group typically gets a druid too (clerics are
usually lacking in numbers!)

We have bards singing AE mana songs, otherwise 3 clerics/2 warlords and a
bard is a possible alternative

For a lower level PoF raid (e.g) I'd prolly go with something like
main cleric, main chanter, puller, main assist, backup healer, perhaps the
slower

Group 2 Second assist, Second chanter, a cleric, then any 3

Each other group, generally give chanters/slowers a cleric.. or at least
some form of healer.  Don't think a shaman can slow mobs and keep a group
healed.. I know a lot who wouldn't even cast slow if they didn't have
somebody in the group to heal.
