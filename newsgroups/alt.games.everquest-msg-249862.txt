Actually there were 2 files in the sounds folder that had problems and I
couldn't delete them for re-patching, so here's what I did:

I renamed the folder sounds1 and then created a new empty folder called
sounds.  I copied all the sound files that weren't corrupted back into the
sounds folder and repatched.  The patch program downloaded the 2 files i
couldn't delete and all is well with the world for now.  I then deleted the
sounds1 folder.

Thanks for the advice everyone!

Lou
