Speaks volumes. I doubt people were contacting your for your cohesion as 
much as for your power and effectiveness. There is a *big* difference. They 
just as likely saw a way to get what they wanted in an uber encounter ready 
guild such as yours. 

Let's say I'm wrong, which is entirely possible. Just enough to avoid 
getting purged? There is obviously something *way* bigger than the trials 
wrong there.
