After much more digging, I was able to find it.

This does still reflect the hell levels, and does provide options for class 
penalties, but when comparing a human warrior to an Iksar warrior, the 
above statements held true. 

According to the chart (depressing as it is) a human warrior requires a 
total of 554,523,300 xp to reach level 60. An Iksar warrior with the same 
amount of xp would be 54,502,200 xp into or about 10% of the way through 
level 58.
