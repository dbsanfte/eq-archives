> Cleric- heal and buff

Doing most of my XPing in PoV (lately at the dragon wall in the north 
part of the zone), you either need a very beefy tank with druid buffs or 
a moderately beefy tank with cleric buffs, so while a cleric is not 
absolutely vital, they are still the kings of healing.  Druid skin buffs 
help a lot with mana regen in a caster heavy group as well.

> Shadowknight- pull and tank

Can replace this with a pally if you can get another puller.  In fact, 
NOT having the tank also pulling will increase kill rate as having the 
tank pull eliminates the possibility of chain pulling when the mobs 
aren't snarable (as many spiders in PoV aren't).  Single pulls aren't 
even *that* critical with good crowd control.  Somewhat vital without it 
though, as getting two unsnarable mobs with no mezzer generally spells 
disaster for a group.

> Enchanter, or bard - buff , mana regen , cc

Can swap in a shaman here if you have a good puller (SK, Monk, Ranger).  
The added melee buffs are a big plus here, especially if the casters 
already have KEI.  The lesser haste is a drag though.  Overall, I think I 
like having an enchanter in this spot better.

Not sure what you're thinking here.  Shaman should go near the bottom if 
you're just talking DPS.  They are not damage dealers.  This leaves mage, 
necro, wizard at the top of the list, which is good, though I might move 
rogue up with 'em, they have some very nice DPS.  BST and MNK I'd 
probably put close to each other after the rogue, with druid coming just 
above SHM for raw DPS.  This of course doesn't take into account the 
utility of a class (which BST and DRU get huge bonuses for, putting the 
druid above wizard and rogue, below necro and mage, and the BST below the 
druid IMO).

I notice rangers are conspicuously absent from this list.  Outdoor 
pulling with harmony, snares and roots for emergency crowd control, the 
ability to tank if the real tank does bite it in a lot of places (this 
assuming the mob is slowed and the cleric has some extra mana laying 
around to step up heals with, not saying rangers make good all-the-time 
tanks), and some of the best sustained DPS in the game with the proper 
AAs.  I suppose if you're constantly fighting stuff inside walls you 
could do better, but that's just bad positioning on the part of the tank
(s).  One of the best groups I've had in a while had 3 rangers in it.  
Then again, I may be biased ;)
