Can't see you could have done much else, on a multi-pull the tanks should
keep an eye on the casters health bars, I know I always do. If there is no
crowd control the Tanks have to run around like headless chickens grabbing
all the mobs attention before returning to assist the main. A party of just
3 tanks, lets say 3 Warriors and 1 cleric is going to struggle when things
turn bad. They maybe the best at what they do (snikt!) but there is no
versatility, no snare, fear, dots or, more importantly, back up heals.

Personally, If I was pulling in that group I'd not have come back with that
many adds, of course in some situations it isn't avoidable.

You'd be surprised to see how much damage the melee's do to the mob over a
fight, given that a caster must be careful of their mana.
