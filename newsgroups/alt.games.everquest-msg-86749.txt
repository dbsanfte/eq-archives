Wow!  Though I'm going to say that's a bit more than well equipped, it's 
pretty damn near uber.  Though I have seen some 15/19 and better bard 
weapons recently, and with only 3 other bards in the guild, it's not 
inconceivable that I may eventually get one.  I suspect that an equally 
uber bard could do 75hp/sec, which is probably more damage than is 
healthy for us.  I guess we better watch out for the nerf bat soon.
