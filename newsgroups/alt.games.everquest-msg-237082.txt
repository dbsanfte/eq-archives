Doh!  I decided to have a little fun and play it...
Had a string of bad luck, starting with an Ice Giant eating my Fire
Pet, killing me, and in the process wiping out most of the Newbies in
everfrost, and ending with a whole lotta corpses and a couple of
undings.

Let's just make a long story short and say, we are no longer talking
about a lvl 50+ character anymore.

BTW how long do you think it would take, to solo a 49 Mage back up to
50+?

Any ideas on where I should solo, and not wipe out an entire zone?
