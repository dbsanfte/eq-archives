When newbie kitty beastmasters turn in their newbie note to the guild
trainer, instead of a tunic they are given a 12/20, +15 to everything,
1HS sword that procs Ice Comet. Sadly, it's no drop and not usable by
the beastmaster class so almost all of the beastmasters destroy them. On
Friday, the weapon is changed to be usable by that class, but the drop
is moved to a dragon equivalent to the Sleeper. The one remaining girl
who didn't destroy hers goes on to become the first levl sixty
beastmaster two weeks from today.
