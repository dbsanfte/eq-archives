  Ah.  That does explain much.  As I've said before, I knew GetsumJ
in-game, before I ever read his name or saw any of his postings in
A.G.E.  We weren't what I could call close personal friends, but we were
friendly acquaintances.  He was always helpful and friendly to me, and
we chatted and hung out together several times.  It really was puzzling
to me see the reception he was getting in A.G.E., at least in the new
(to me) beginning when he was behaving himself.

   If I had been around for his initial volley into this newsgroup, I
imagine I would have been much chillier to him in-game, and we would
never have gotten along in game as well as we did.
