Cookware requires BOTH smithing and pottery, but there is a real difference
in price and skills required depending on which main skill you use.

All cookware can be made by a smith, using metal bits, the appropriate
mold(s), a flask of water and a potter made ceramic lining all combined in a
forge.

All cookware but bread tins can be made by a potter using the appropriate
sketch, some clay (recipes differ), a flask of water and a smith made metal
bit combined on a potter's wheel and then fired in a kiln with a firing
sheet.

Pots and smokers are made cheapest by a potter and require fairly low skill.
Cake rounds and muffin tins are best made by a smith, as they are pretty
expensive for a potter to make. Bread tins can only be made by a smith.

Hope that clears things up.
