Point being,never ever do I look on my xp bar when doing an
adventure,thats how EQ should be,not pure xp grind.
But on AB its nearly impossible to find a Ldon group for my
55 Ranger there.Can you imagine,that I cant get the 40 points
for the 40 damge proc from Tak,13 points there, or the 75 damage
proc from Miraguls,39 points there ?
Thats what I mean when I "whine" about EQ1 unplayable since
EQ2 in my other posts,and will make me leave when WoW is
released in Europe.
