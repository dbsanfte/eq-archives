The main reason I believe the wizards don't complain about them as much is
the get the "planar" ports too.  and translocate to bindpoint.  They need to
give druids more ports if they are going to keep doing this.

And yes I enjoy the run from PoK to Gunthuk.  I have a 54 shaman and a 36
druid.  I could easily slap some cha gear on my halfling and port her off to
stonebrunt run in and buy the stuff for my shaman for the dyes and illusion
potions, I enjoy running through there and on TT there is rarely anyone
exping in Warrens so I will kill on way to work on Paineel and Erudin
faction while I'm at it.
