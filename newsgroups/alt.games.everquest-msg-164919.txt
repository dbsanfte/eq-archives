That's what the Zlandi heart is for, regen owns for necros.

I should be getting a Z heart within the next few days, I'll have to throw
in on my necro for a little while and see how it is.

Most of his gear I've gotten while hunting on my druid, or got for cheap in
bazaar (coterie general cape - 50pp, oh yeah; sickly glowing orb, 200, ring
of frost spiders, 25pp)  I haven't updated his profile in a while though,I'm
fairly sure it's changed a bit, and I know I sold a bunch of stuff (the cape
and some flayed skin) to a vendor at one point to get enough cash on him
quick to buy some mispriced Crystal chitin arms for 200pp.

I really should play my necro again, at least get him up to where he can
actually click his Circlet(nerfed version, but I like toys... why else would
I be trying to buy an AoN for my druid)
