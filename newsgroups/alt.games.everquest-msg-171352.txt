In FG I had a Fungal Beast dire charmed while in an AE group. We
pulled about 30 mobs and were killing them, when our cleric died, do
the wizard succored us to zone in. I immeditaely ran back to the lake
where we were fighting, and watched as all the mobs were killing each
other. It was quite a sight. One of the wizards was there watching
too. Since the mobs were near dead, I ae stunned and he ae nuked a
couple times.  We actually got full experience for those 30 or so
deaths.

This doesnt work everytime.

I've noticed that about 12 out of 10 times a charmed mob will keep
fighting.

Heres another great charm story:

I charmed a Lotus in FG that was near a shroom camp. The shrooms
immediately attacked the Lotus while I ae stunned. The Lotus was
actually casting ae nukes on the shrooms and was doing pretty good,
until charm broke. Unfortunately my run3 speed did not help me get to
the zone line, as the Lotus summoned me back and I got pummeled by 6
mobs.
