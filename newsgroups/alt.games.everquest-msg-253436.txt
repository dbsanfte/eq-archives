I've been getting these emails for banks that I dont bank at and paypal
which I've never used.  I used to just delete.  Recently I've been told it
is a good idea to forward the email to abuse@name_of_company.com and also to
copy and paste the header information.  Hopefully someone will take it
seriously that their customers may be being defrauded using their name and
will take steps to persecute.
