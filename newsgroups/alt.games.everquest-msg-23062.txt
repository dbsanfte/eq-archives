I was playing in a group the other day, and we decided to turn autosplit on.
We were killing sarnaks in LOIO, and they generally drop 1 to 3pp. We had 2
tanks, and 4 others. The tanks were always close to the fights and usually
looted while the others medded, twisted songs or healed the tanks.

Then we started to chat about shared looting, and we were wondering how it
worked.... the tank said he looted 2pp4gp and some change, and all 5 others
only got 1sp and 2cp.

At first, we figured that it had to do with the availablitiy of coins. 2pp
cannot be splitted between 6 persons, and since nor the corpse, nor the
looter is a bank that can split 2pp up, we figured that the looter would get
everything that could not be split up.

In other words:
Loot = 6pp? we all get 1 pp
Loot = 5pp? Looter gets lucky, because 5pp cannot be divided by 6.

Now in the long run this wouldn't really matter, if you level to 50 or so,
and loots start to be 60 or 70pp a kill, who cares about a 6pp difference.
But for the small leveled it is sure a helluvelot of money.

Now a few sarnaks later, there was one that dropped 6gp and some change. The
tank that looted however, got 6gp, and everyone else got 1sp and some
copper. Now.... 6 gp CAN be divided by six, so there goes the above theory.

Either way, in general the looter always gets more money when using shared
looting, which might not be fair for the casters that need to med up for the
next fight.

Is there anyone here that can explain how loot-splitting/sharing works? I
can't seem to figure it out properly :)

Thanx


Maarten
