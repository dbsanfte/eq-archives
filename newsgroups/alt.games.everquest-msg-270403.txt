Hmmm.. correction... the forums tab doesn't actually provide access to 
the official forums, just a page saying access to that is reserved for 
paying customers.

At first I didn't think that made sense... but then giving away free 
access with no cc info required is just asking for trolls to sign up. 
(ie people who have no intention of playing but who want to start flames 
on the forums...) They also might do some of their customer support 
there, and again don't want to impact their paying playerbase... so 
perhaps its understandable.
