I noticed somehting very strange relating to this today.  I bought a
velium weapon off of a trader, then thought, eh I should get another, so
was about to click on him again and he was LD.  I'm wondering if buying
something could cause the crashes :(

I used to do this, but I stopped after I was embarrased one to many
times, when not being able to talk to people.  Or not hearing any
replies to my what's camped? and going off and starting to kill things
in someones camp - then not hearing thier shouts at me :)  Then there
was the worst time.  I accidentally turned off group speak... thought my
group was really really quiet...
