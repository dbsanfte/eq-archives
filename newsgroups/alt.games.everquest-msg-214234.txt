Yet, we have 45 people at 75+% attendence, 3 on hold with
RL things going on, me at 59% (after my final term of school
and RL things going on).  We've managed to key 25 folks
for ST in the last 2 or so months and are working hard toward
the rest.  We are advancing -- we're taking names we couldn't
take 2 months ago.  Sont used to require 35 or so people and
a couple of tries.  The last couple we've gone early with
24 and got him first time (we compete with another guild on
our server for ST key mobs.  Sont and company are "All hands
on deck" mobs.  Worth 25rpp to drop everything and jump on
over to WW when the call goes out.)

Better yet, we are oriented around putting guild exp groups
together in addition to raiding.
