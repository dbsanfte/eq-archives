Ok, I see your point and I will take it to heart.

/ooc 3 monks, a rogue and a SK looking for a 6th to form an AE group!

No, I lied.  It's still retarded.  Just because something is *possible* does
not make it in any way a recommendable tactic.

And by the way, I've been in perfectly "adequate" AE groups before playing
as my monk.  You don't see me advocating it as a good idea, though, because
it isn't.  Another wizard, enchanter, magician would have been a much better
option for the group (and yes, in that case, even a cleric would have been a
better option).
