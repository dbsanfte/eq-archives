You will not evade me, "Annie M. Benson-Lennaman" <abenlen@yahoo.com>:

Sidetracking: Neither line works with fast food joints. My mother
occasionally stops by McDonalds and picks up some stuff, and I am in
the perpetual process of training her to never order something that
has ketchup by default for me. Because, no matter how many times she
asks to have mine without ketchup, it's ALWAYS there for me to scrape
out when I get the thing.
When I order something in a fast food joint myself, I ask if it has
ketchup before ordering. If it does, I order something else.

(I'm also opposed to Pepsi/Coke by default things)
