TBoots are indeed sold, I think it is Sol B.  They are the same speed as
JBoots, but do indeed have a casting time, vs no casting time on JBoots.
Basically, the big advantage of JBoots is you can cast while running.  Both
are the same speed as a level 9 sow as I understand it.  Sow potions cast a
sow potion of the level of the potion drinker.  I'm sure if I got any of
that wrong, someone will correct me.
