Ahh biz, you know I keep you out of my killfile just for the amusement of
seeing you rail against the various and sundry.  Of all the people that read
and post to this group, you are at the very bottom of the list of people I
have an interest in having an actual discussion with.  =P

(Post intentionally written in such a way that the first time bizbee will
see it is when he's trolling back over old posts on Google, so he can steam
without the option of responding.)  =)
