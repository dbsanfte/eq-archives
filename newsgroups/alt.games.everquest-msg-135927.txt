Hi everyone:

Taking time-out from playing my main, and I've decided to make a Necro alt.
Is there a way to make an assist key that will assist my pet, yet I don't
have to keep manually changing the pet name each time my companion dies. I
thought /assist pet might work, but sadly it doesn't ..

Safe hunting as always ..

Stevie.
