I dont think im really a newbie anymore but i still get bugged in EQ by the
same kind of people as you

First people that are rude to newbies (maybe they re compensating something
in eq? dunno)

Second people that won't help (never understood that anyways), or have the
'life-is-hard-get-over-it' attitude. Plaguing the game explaining that, if
they re a pain in this game, its  cause they know life so well -and thats
the way life is. Eww.



But! Im still playing. Interesting people exist in EQ, find them - or get
some addicted :-)

Too you may want to find some sites on the net : a good game knowledge
definitely makes a difference in EQ.

BTW, Spirit of the Wolf makes you run faster. Typically if you re losing a
battle you begin to run to the zone. If you re not sowed, the mobs can hit
you all the way to the zone. If you re sowed they can't, and you survive.
Ask nicely for it, druids are sometimes tired of being the sow-dealers of
the zone.

Welcome to EQ :-)
