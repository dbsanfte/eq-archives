This usually happens whenever I play a low level alt in Unrest (which seems
to be a popular PL zone on RN server). My advice would be put them all on
ignore and continue to play if at all possible. You're not doing anything
wrong. If they are deliberately training you then try to get a higher level
friend to come watch over you and report them to a guide. Nothing will
likely happen if you do report them but at least the characters involved are
highlighted to the guides and who knows who else has reported them lately?
;)

Whenever a similar thing happens to me (especially in Lower Guk with faction
grinders training me) I firstly try to reason with them and try to get
myself a 'safe area' established. If that fails then I log out, get my main
into the zone and make it known to the person causing trains that I am not a
newb and will not hesitate to camp and clear the area that he/she is trying
to take from me.

If they continue to train you then an empty zone will pretty soon force them
to go elsewhere.
