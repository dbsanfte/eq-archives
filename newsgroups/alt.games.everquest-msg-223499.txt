Unfair and not true - griefers know about this stuff earlier than 
anyone, because, they're griefers and are looking for this kind of stuff.

Mass TL to bind has been the wizards choice of bazaar griefing since the 
spell came out - even if it doesn't send folk away, it may cause enough 
to lag and LD out to free a trader spot.  Now the limits have been 
increased in the bazaar I rarely awake to find my trader with the option 
in front of him (or perhaps it's expiring quickly?)
