 3.  In bb, what drops Gnoll skins. (non-ruined)   I think that elite
 drop the pelts.

Have you found mobs that drop ruined gnoll skins? These same mobs drop the
non-ruined skins, just a little rarer.

Try this: Next time you're in BB, check who is there. (click "MAIN", then
click "WHO" case you didn't know)

If there are high level people there, they are probably hunting the Gnoll
Commander. Send them a tell, asking politely if they have found any gnoll
skins or pelts. Tell them it's for a quest, and ask nicely, they may just
hand them over to you.

I know some people like to do things by themselves (me included), but a
little help is never a bad thing.
