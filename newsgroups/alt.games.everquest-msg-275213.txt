About the same on Saryrn.

I saw the low level (20-55 these days, I guess) game take a massive hit
when OoW came out - I guess a lot of people at 65 were playing alts until
some more advancement came along. It went from almost instant groups
(mostly LDoNs, not all camps were busy, but there was usually a group
forming at one camp in your level range) to not getting any groups over
the course of a whole day LFG. This bounced back a little but EQ2 and
WoW, and the holidays, all but killed it off again. I know the lowbies
in my guild spend a lot of time soloing and camping quest drops while
LFG. I have seen a few people come back from EQ2 though. Also seen
somebody who was burnt out on EQ, get enthused and start playing again
because he couldn't pick up a copy of WoW.

As for me, at 65 (and non elemental), I don't spend all that much time
LFG. Sure, if I sit in PoK all day it might be a while until I get a
group, but getting off my ass and visiting zones, or asking friends, that
makes groups happen. And it's not that I only ever play with the same
people, but I do try hard to have a reputation as someone that's good to
group with, to minimise my LFG time.
