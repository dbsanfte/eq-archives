I should have also mentioned that I do not just send a /tell to a name
from a /who list (well, except when in need of a rez/rev to mitigate
a long CR).  If I see a character who looks like they might be able to
provide what I want, I confirm the class by observation or /who [char]
and then send them a /tell when they are visibly unengaged.  But as I
mentioned above, it does work much better (for me anyway) to send a
/tell than to move into /say range.  Also, I only send ever a single
/tell and accept no response as a negative response.  I detest those who
spam me with /tells, I'd have to be pretty incredibly stupid to expect a
favorable response from committing the same offense myself.
