If you're casting KEI for donations then why are you upset when people 
donate? If you expect a minimum payment then why not state so? I 
consider "donation" to mean whatever I feel like paying. If you expect a 
minimum payment then you should either state that beforehand or you must 
accept what you get.

 From WordNet (r) 1.7 [wn]:

   donation
        n 1: a voluntary gift (as of money or service or ideas) made to
             some worthwhile cause [syn: {contribution}]
        2: act of giving in common with others for a common purpose
           especially to a charity [syn: {contribution}]


I once went on a porting round to raise some platinum using my 
girlfriend's druid. If I asked for donations then sometimes players 
would donate something well below my expectations. I couldn't complain 
because I did ask for "donations". After I advertised ports for 20pp per 
port (she was a level 34 druid at the time) I had no problems.
