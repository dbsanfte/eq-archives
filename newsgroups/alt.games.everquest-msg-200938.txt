Long long time ago my rogue was on the orc hill near Kelethin.  Back
then folks were pretty friendly and helped each other out there. 
Anyway, guy is fighting and going down at about the same rate as the
orc.  I stepped over to help and he told me to back off.  Someone else
on the hill said "Let him die".  So we stood back, and watched as he
went down, down, down.  About 2 hits for death he suddenly started
screaming for help.  Of course, no one moved :)
