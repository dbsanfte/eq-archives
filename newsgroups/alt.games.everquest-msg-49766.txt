Yes, you can get a GeForce 2 for a song right now.  Also, nVidia recently
released a budget line of their GeForce 3, but I don't remember what it is
called.  The GeForce 2 is running around 70 or 80 bucks right now and the
budget GeForce 3 is less than 200.  ATI has Radeon cards that are a good
answer to the GeForce line, also, and are worth looking into.  However, you
can't go wrong with the GeForce.  It seems to be the standard these days.

By the way, DAoC has horses, but you don't own them, you just rent them to
travel from one place to another.  You don't even control them.  I hear they
are working on implementing them other ways as well though.

Best Regards
