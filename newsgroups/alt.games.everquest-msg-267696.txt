You buy a "message board" from a character near the Broker NPC. In Freeport
it is in South Freeport where you find the broker and the armour/weapon
smiths down by the waterfront.

The message board costs 1 silver and some copper. You take the message board
back and place it in your house. You can then sell stuff from your inventory
through it (it temporarily sets your house access to vistors allowed). I
haven't tested it yet but I suspect you have to stay in the house in this
"vendor mode".
