Coincidentally, I just sold my PS2 this week; it hadn't even been turned 
on in over six months. I toyed with the idea of putting the money 
towards an X-Box (Burnout 3 sounds pretty sweet, but I'll definitely 
stay the hell away from Halo 2. I can't even contemplate playing an FPS 
with a joypad). The problem is, I can see that the X-Box would 
eventually share the same fate, so I guess I'll save up for an Athlon 64 
and get my machine ready for Half-Life 2.
