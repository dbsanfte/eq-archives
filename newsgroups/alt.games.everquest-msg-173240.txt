Just be careful about grabbing your victim, you want a single pull, and you
will want to bring it to the zone wall safe from adds.  Personally, I tended
to do that by move up the wall from the graveyard, then heading to the left
a bit away from the graveyard, but before hitting the stream.  At the stream
there is a two spawn, which I have had luck single pulling in the past, but,
last time I tried, it was not working out.  Instead, I stopped halfway
between the stream and the graveyard, and just headed out into the zone,
looking for a lonely victim, then pulled him to the zone wall between the
stream and the graveyard, and killed him there.
