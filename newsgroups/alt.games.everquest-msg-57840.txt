Heh!... what's with the born again virgin thing I keep hearing about. 
Can someone tell me why in the world all these people are talking about 
not having sex. It's like a natural human impulse. Someone actually sent 
me a website last week that explains how to resist your sex urges step 
by step. It's a pretty fancy pants site, like someone spent a whole 
lotta $$$$ on it. And, it's a totally absurd, www.4040club.com. A total 
spoof on abstinence. C'mon, lets get real now, shall we. Once you lose 
it, you cant get it back. The damage is done, no pun intended. You can 
abstain from sex, but you're still not a virgin. Doh!
