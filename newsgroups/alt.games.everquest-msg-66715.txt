Luclin looks a lot better on my geforce2 than Daoc.  (when i say luclin i
mean the actual moon...not retextures of old areas).  I mean a LOT better
and its a lot more detailed and interesting.  Daoc is pretty monotonous and
has a lot of boring cities.  I find the cat city alone is more interesting
than all 3 of the Daoc camelot cities put together.  EQ has great city
design and use of 3D (ie. things under and on top of each other...tunnels,
etc...)  The foliage in Luclin is a lot better than in daoc whose trees are
comparable to the old parts of EQ (i.e. rather amateurish looking).  I think
the models are MUCH  nicer in luclin--the cat guards for example just look
amazing to me. there is nothing anywhere near that detailed in Daoc.
(though i agree with many people that the new ogre models look like big ugly
babies).

Gameplay-- well EQ has such vastly superior PvE that I don't even know where
to begin.  Above ground EQ is HUGE--daoc is TINY.  Then there are tons of
fascinating and interesting dungeons to explore in EQ (the funnest parts of
the game IMHO)--Daoc has a handful of underdeveloped ones (sure its a new
game and they may get better with time...but why bother? EQ has it's shit
together in that department already!)  Daoc is boring to level in because
you get all your spells within like the first 4 levels...the rest are just
variations of the same damn thing....EQ dishes out the goodies a LOT better
for every class.

The highly touted quests are boring in Daoc...in fact i find some of the
ones in EQ a lot more interesting and worthwhile.  And no camping in Daoc?
total BS...while its not nearly as bad as a heavily populated EQ server, it
still goes on.  And atleast you really get something great in EQ that really
feels worthwhile afterward.  I get a ho-hum feeling about everything in
Daoc.

Another couple annoying things about Daoc is that you can't swim under
water...3rd person only view ALL the time is a bit of an annoyance as well
as their sloppy added at the last minute first person view isn't even
techincally supported, and that horses only go on a few preplanned trails.

Now before I get attacked for being a fanboi, let me tell you my story...i
played EQ heavily for 6 months a couple summers ago.  Amassing a few 50+ lvl
characters.  I got really burnt out and quit...then about 6 months later I
was jonesing so I started a new character on a new server (i had deleted all
my old characters--note: deleted not sold!  to be honest i had a snit when i
quit and deleted them in frustration ;-p, but i wouldn't have sold them
anyway--i had just wanted a clean break from EQ.)  Starting EQ was rather
fun, but it was only to tide me over till AO came out...so then AO came out
(had only gotten my new wiz to level 34 and was getting pissed off not being
able to get jboots--3 days wasted...worst time i ever had trying to get
them)  and then I WASTED almost 2 months with that turgid piece of shit
Anarchy online.  'nuff said on that.  All the bad things you've heard about
that game are true.  So then i was totally burnt out with MMORPG so i didn't
play anything until DArk Age of camelot came out which i was determined ot
LOVE!!! i mean i wanted sooooooooooo bad to love it and never go back to eq.
but it just didn't happen. its a decent game, but it never sparked the
passion i felt for eq.  its a ho-hum world--and the lopsided RvR combat
didn't hide that fact.

EQ is vastly superious for PvE and that's all there is to it.  anyone who
says anything else needs their brain checked for tumors.  As far as RvR
goes...well great!  everyone knows EQ hasn't had the strongest PvP, so i
have no problems giving the award to daoc--esp. since i dont have much
interest in PvP unless its in Unreal tournament.

ps. i'm not bothering to check this post for mistakes so sue me ;-p  if it
sucks it sucks.
