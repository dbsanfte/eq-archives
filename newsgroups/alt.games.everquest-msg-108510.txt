It's funny, Ben.  You follow such a predictable pattern.  Someone posts 
something, it really doesn't seem to matter what.  You follow up in a 
manner that is nitpicky, but more to the point, blatantly abusive to the 
previous poster.  They follow up taking exception to it (big suprise), and 
then the exchange goes back and forth for a few posts.  Then you post 
something about how THEY were abusive to you FIRST, and why the heck did 
they do that?  On at least one occasion, you went back and copied the part 
of the post where they SUDDENLY and with absolutely NO provocation, got 
all pissy with you.  On the occasion I remember, the really, really funny 
(to me) part was that you also included exactly what you said that pissed 
them off!

So here's my little worldly wisdom:  If someone suddenly becomes all 
abusive with you, you might take a look at what exactly you said that set 
them off.  In general, the posts you have made that set people off were, 
to my eyes at least, very, very obviously rude.  There have been one or 
two where, by some stretch of the imagination, you may not have -meant- to 
be rude but it was easily interpreted that way.  I quite understand that 
you're content with being incredibly rude and don't care what people 
think, but there's a little nitpicky logical inconsistency here when 
you're accusing them of having been rude first.

Just one word of warning.  Don't you dare be rude to me, or I shall be 
forced to be viciously and savagely polite to you.

}Abuse follows abuse. I don't hold grudges. I forget who said what in a

}even notice.

Yes, apparently you quickly forget what -you- said as well.  But you so 
clearly remember the other party having been rude first... :) stretch that 
memory back, just one more post... You might learn something about 
yourself or human behaviour if you can better understand what it is 
you're doing that gets them so riled up.

By the way, I'm enjoying the lowtax .sigs. :)
