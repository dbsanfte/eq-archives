LDoN is a success?? Yes you're right in one perspective.

Personally I would wish I could somehow deliver the expansion back. I was 
kinda forced into buying it, cause my roomie bought it and told me that my 
�ber warrior would be in high demand (XP and AA signs in my eyes).

Why do I want to deliver LDoN back then?
Well, from the beginning I saw no improvements in LDoN at all, and still I 
hardly see them. First weekend after LDoN release actually proved me right.

LDoN is kinda like at whole big cheat basket. Hmm maybe use trainer word 
instead of cheat.

First weekend after LDoN release (I still didn't had LDoN then) I parked my 
WAR in PoT as usual, hoping to get a group in PoI. It was normal 
weekend rush hour for the US, so there was plenty logged in.
Well of we go, flagged myself as lfg'ing, ooc'ed with 2 mins interval, no 
response. Did some group searches and found several lfa'ing to LDoN. 
Waited.....waited....waited....

After 3 hours with no luck in finding af group for my 53 warrior, I logged 
off.

The nightmare was a reality. LDoN which is a great improvement to get XP 
and AA has nerfed EverQuest.

The MMORPG which the game is, has become somewhat like a minor RPG game 
like Diablo or Baldurs Gate. The world of hunting and training has shrunk 
into max amount for grouping and raiding.

Never shall we hear the words like camp check or the swearing and threaths 
of petition when ppl camp- & kill steal.

Of course LDoN wont take away the hunt for �ber bosses valued drop, but 
honestly there ain't much fun left for the lowbies (30es and under).

Augments is nice. Finally my sword with 200dmg per slash can be buffed to 
do more, but why? What is wrong with the equipment back in the old days?

Whole Augment stuff sounds like a SWG story. My lightsaber isn't good 
enough, so I'll just pump in this �ber TV-Shop battery pack and lightbulp 
and then I will have the longest rod ever.

Yes LDoN is popular, it makes it easy for us to get our valued XP and AA so 
we can get lvl 65 faster than before. And yes we love the new items we can 
get. But I feel and can see that zones have died. The game EverQuest is 
know more concentrated in 2 handfull of areas in the whole game.
And I fear that there wont be any more newcomers to EQ. If there will be, 
they will be meet with lonely zones and being "locked" out from adventuring 
cause they are not big enough for LDoN, and certainly as NoSpam wrote not 
able to group in LDoN cause of the minimum demand on lowbies.

To SOE, great expansion you've done, it must have taken a whole lot of time 
to program.

But truely LDoN and the next expansion, which will be mostly centered on a 
new graphics engine, is the sign that this will be the last expansion, and 
last try to get money from us, before EQ2 will rise.
