I tried this shortly after I first started playing on Discord; after 
dying the first time I noticed my guild tunic was still there.  Sold the 
new one, then looted the old one; a couple silver in my pocket.  Then I 
deliberately died again a couple times, guild notes still on bodies; 
hand in, sell tunic, hand in, sell tunic, hand in, keep tunic.  Three 
hand ins barely made half a blue, it would take 60 bodies to make second 
level at that rate, while it took just 4 rodent kills to accomplish the 
same thing.

I had a storebought backpack and a Large Sewing Kit on the body, both 
were gone, only the backpack* which I was issued when I made the 
character remained.  It was, however, full, and I suspect you are right, 
  its impossible to open a pack and empty it, so having a no drop pack 
allows you to preserve droppables.

Thus, I said you should convert all cash to gems once you level up to 
where you can get killed.. and that you should deliberately die several 
times right off the bat, not for the free food or drink, or even the 
bandages, or even the utility of several free backpacks, but for the far 
more important utility of several No Drop backpacks for keeping your 
goodies if you should get PKed.

He looted a good many things that people were auctioning for a gold 
each, and which merchants sell (if they have them, they only get them 
from players) for 7 silvers each, and presumably pay even less.  But he 
left something that -doesn't- drop, that only merchants sell, and which 
merchants get over 2pp for.  I didn't look, but I'll bet they also pay 
more than a pp for it... more, any way you look at it, than all the 
other stuff he looted off me combined, other than perhaps the large 
sewing kit.  I won't buy another of those, the guy that sold it to me 
stands right next to a loom, and I was also buying my patterns from him, 
what an idiot I was!

My 8th or 9th character on Discord, the server lends itself remarkably 
well to trying stuff out for a while and then rerolling.  I wanted to 
stay in the GFay area since my previous character, a high elf wizard, 
had a good deal of cash (considering we are talking level 1 restart) to 
"twink" my new character with.  I'd done bard, and druid recently, but 
hadn't tried a warrior on the server at all, and what the heck.

Funny thing is, he was my most successful character so far, the only one 
I actually got to level 6.  PvP he might suck for, but PvE, his high HP 
total and utter lack of mana concerns simplified life a good deal; easy 
enough to compare the rate at which his HP bar was droppng compared to 
his target's, and to run to guard if things were clearly not going to 
work out, better still, if things were close he always closed the deal 
dropping into berserk mode near the end of a fight, remarkably effective 
given that it doesn't seem to be of much interest in normal play.

I don't think any class would have done well against an SK 18 levels 
higher than him, although perhaps pure casters could have got a Gate 
off... which would have left them dead at their bind spot instead of out 
in the field, since I was also DOTTed.  Would the killer get the points 
if I died out of the same zone?  Not that I would be any happier dead 
with my killer not getting the points, in fact, I think thats a crock if 
thats the way it works... but I suspect it is.  At any rate, the main 
benefit would be that it would be harder for the killer to loot my 
gear... but a caster doesn't have his money tied up in gear, its in 
spells, which are all erased from his book on death.

Splendid
