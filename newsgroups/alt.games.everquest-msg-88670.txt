Suffered a similar fate in Surefall after messing with the bears.  Dead at
the bottom of the water way in the caves. Became a Ranger, was able to drag
my Paladin corpse out of the caves without being bothered by the bears or
the Rangers inside.  If a DE Necro is safe in Befallen, it is the best way
to go.
