That's the whole point, isn't it? :) Clicking for hours is not my idea
of fun (and I have only done it once, needed 65 points of smithing
before patch) but I do want to grandmaster tailoring one day, I want
200 or at least 175 skill in the other trades, and I am now
considering knocking out a set of gold ornate chain for my warrior
and/or teaching my high elf to smith with the new style stuff.

Should probably also add that my prize possession is my coldain shawl,
version 6 and counting.

Baking and fletching were kind of fun, since it was convenient to drag
a few stacks of components with me and combine during downtime. I got
my fletching up to 185 by porting to surefall and getting components
in between respawns in whatever zone tunnel of Chardok I was camping.
I am about to start jewelcraft and guess I will have to sit in front
of a vendor for that, so I figure I'll do that when I feel like
auctioning off my collection of low end junk.

On my main: Baking 143, Smithing 175. Brewing 170 (horrid faydwer
shaker skillup rate), Fishing 123, Fletching 185, Pottery 172,
Tailoring 148, Jewelry 21 (hehe). Pretty much all my alts are learning
rudimentary tailoring and semi-decent baking, the melees are learning
to fletch their own pulling arrows, and I am considering letting them
all learn to brew fruit juice as well.
