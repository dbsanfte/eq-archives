When I dinged 61, the only mobs that went light blue on me in PoN were the 
Young Bats, so no issues in PoN for dinging 61.  Don't know about beyond 
that, but, given that I have just about all my 62 spells now, I am thinking 
of working more seriously towards that, and seeing what it looks like.  If 
it looks bad, I can always delevel.
