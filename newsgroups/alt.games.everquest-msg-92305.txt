Isn't it strange that people will pay for SoW, Clarity, Ports, Buffs, but
Ress a guy and expect anything from it and you are the anti christ.

One of the things about being a cleric is being poor, dead poor, for a LONG
LONG time. Now after two years, I finally have something that people are
willing to pay for.

Let alone all the tells of

Hi! can you do a res please?
Sure bring me the corpse.
He is dead three zones over and I don't know where the body is.
Then you have a problem.
I can spare 10 plat...

or

Need a ress please
Ok 100 plat
You one of those are you? well I won't pay
Ok your loss
you are such an ass, I will never give you a sow or a port again!
ok *hits Jboots and runs off*
