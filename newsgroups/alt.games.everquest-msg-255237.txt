No, that's not "the only reason" by a longshot. Although a part of the
difference can be attributed to the differences in spoiler information
available, it's certainly not the significant reason. Both games have
experience requirements that scale as you increase in levels. I don't know
how the two scales compare (I would guess that the scaling is more dramatic
in CoH, but I can't confirm that, it would be interesting for someone with
actual data to chime in here on the point). The difference, however, is that
in EQ there are always mobs that provide an equivalently higher level of
experience such that the number of mobs to hit the next level is reasonably
consistent from level to level. I recall specifically that I experienced
minor, mostly indistinguishable differences from level to level getting from
30-to-50, and the actual time spent on each level was fairly consistent.
Grouping to kill reds was dramatically easy particularly in the 60's, when I
sailed into 65 in a few days. That is not the case in CoH, where I've found
that getting from n to n+1 has taken an increasingly longer time period, and
considerably more mobs. And I know where all the mobs are.

By the way, your anecdotal offering that "People HAVE been able to hit max
level (50) in CoH in a matter of weeks or less even without exploits as it
is, too." is just as irrelevant to this conversation as if I were to cite
the fact that people HAVE taken EQ characters from 1-65 with Epic in 3 days.
/shrug There are always people who can push whatever constraints exist, it
doesn't have any bearing at all on the issue at hand, which is the relative
difficulty of doing one vs. the other.

By the way, I've heard you say in other messages that you've never taken an
EQ character to 65 in all the years that you've played this game. I suspect
also that you don't have characters in CoH that are above 30, but I have no
idea really so feel free to set the record straight with an explanation as
to why your input is meaningful on the comparison I raised (which you
snipped) on the relative difference between leveling from 30-50.
