Ummm, if you don't like blathering, gossipy morons, why are you guilded 
with them?  I think this is a clear case of wrong guild for the person.  
If a guild exists solely to gossip and blather (and that's a perfectly 
legitmate purpose for a guild), and you don't like that, why are you in 
it?  I would assume that people join guilds because they want to associate 
with the people in the guild.

Doctor, it hurts when I hit myself in the head with this hammer.  
Well, don't hit yourself in the head with a hammer!

Bullshit.  If you think that communication involves turning off guildchat 
because it annoys you, I hope you have a mouse in your pocket, because 
communicating with yourself doesn't really cut it.  Communication would be 
saying, 
/gu Hey, there's a lot of chatter going on, it's distracting, I'm going to 
turn guildchat off.  If there is anything going on, please send me a tell.

How would you know to be there?  You've already said that you would turn 
/guildchat off.  Do you expect to be sent a specific tell, /tell bizbee we 
are gathering a group to go explore this dungeon, would you like to come 
rather than /gu we are getting a group together to explore <dungeon>, we 
need two more people to fill out the first group, but can easily do a 2 or 
3 group raid.

Again, why in the fuck would you be associated with that type of guild?  A 
guild of mature, focused players respects each other and wouldn't consider 
that.  I've never needed a teleport, and with Nexes only the laziest 
players (or those without SoL) need a port at all for general travel now.  
Do I ask for teleports, especially in the hour or so before a scheduled 
raid?  Of course I do, but I get to a port spot, then ask for one.  Do I 
ever get pissy if nobody can port me?  Not in the least.  
(A rather enlightening example:  On our guild message board about 6 weeks 
ago we had a thread thanking the porters for all the stuff they do for the 
guild, often being on a bit early and staying a bit late.  It then evolved 
into a discussion on carrying portal fragments, and etiquette for getting 
picked up for a raid.  The porters didn't start it, and didn't really 
participate other than to say, Thanks for appreciating us.  Oh, and please 
hit <ctrl>-d before accepting a TL.)

Then why in the fuck would you even worry about the others?  Do you spend 
you time worried about the dumbfucks who think the Jerry Springer show is 
quality journalism?  Or that the WWF is real?  Or that wearing a tin-foil 
hat keeps the mind-rays from working on you?  The world is full of idiots, 
and EQ is no different.  All it takes is a /guildremove to take yourself 
out of a guild.
Doctor, it hurts when I hit myself in the head with this hammer.
Well, don't hit yourself in the head with a hammer.

You've spent a whole bunch of energy talking about about you're not there 
to do shit for the guild.  You're right, you're not there to be their 
bitch, or port them around, but you haven't mentioned once what you give 
to the guild.  Our guild application form asks applicants to state both 
what they can offer to the guild, and what they expect from the guild.  
It's an open ended question, but it does a hell of a job of weeding out 
idiots.  
A guild is a cooperative organization.  If you don't want to contribute, 
but only want to take, or even better bitch about how you're not going to 
contribute, you are better off not being involved.

Why do you expect a different response if you have guildchat turned off 
vs. you don't play anymore?  (Hint:  Many, if not most, raiding guilds 
have minimum play times.  If you don't do a certain number of hours a 
week, you will be guildremoved, hopefully after a discussion with guild 
officers.  If you're not on the <foo> hours per week, you'll be 
/guildremoved.)  So, if you're not in /guildchat, it's the same as not 
being on according to you, so you should be /guildremoved.
Doctor, it hurts when I hit myself in the head with this hammer.
Well drop the fucking hammer and stop bitching about it!
