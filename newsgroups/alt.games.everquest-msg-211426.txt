Hmmm, I'm thinking if I take out the /sit I can forget about any pause
and if I run into fizzles just hit it again.  I probably won't be
paying much attention most of the time, but when the time comes for
this guy to kick in I will probably notice fizzles.  As long as I
don't have to wait out the pause I can just hit the key again correct?
