But nost of them are missing the target. I a 'casual' dedicated grouper 
view the following:

I won't go to PC or DSP with my alts. Period. I think they're a blight 
on the game. I level my various alts elsewhere.

The nexus was

I go there to get the odd spell. Don't care for the zone. And personally 
think SOE made a real mistake abandoning faction. My current SK alt 
still factioned for HHK, Cabilis, etc despite the utter irrelevance of 
oldworld cities... In fact I'm doing Greenmist right now with my Erudite 
SK alt.

> Bazaar? Poor
> casuals never had time to sell their items.

I can count on my fingers all the things I've ever bought in the bazaar. 
Every single one of them were 1) Items that had to be foraged. (bits for 
the solstice earring) 2) Items that needed to be enchanted. (enchanted 
platinum, imbued black pearls, etc). Everything else I've ever had I've 
farmed myself.

I couldn't care less about the bazaar and was happier when trading took 
place in North Freeport/EC/Kelethin. They could remove it tomorrow and I 
wouldn't miss it.

I have been a staunch opponent of the PoK ever since it was added. 
Though I do use it... Its simply too convenient for it to make sense to 
boycott. If they removed it tomorrow, I wouldn't have a complaint 
though.

I have said numerous times that the xp comes too fast now to the 
detriment of the players. I deliberately level more slowly as the result 
of the fact that I see as much level appropriate content as I can as I 
level.

I like a lot about LDoN, but think it was poorly implemented. In 
particular I don't care for the wayfarer magii, nor do like the simple 
zones. I do like the existance of instanced content, though not as 
implemented by Sony. But I beleive some content -should- be one 
groupable, and not be vulnerable to zerk tactics. Its nice to see that 
not every challenge will fall if you bring enough people. I do like the 
idea of adventure points, because they are a currency like plat that 
can't be bought or sold... so items bought with AP represent some sort 
of real actual effort instead of just twink gear/pp or ebay pp.

Apparently your confusing casual dedicated player with incessant whining 
baby as if they were insepparable. I've grouped with plenty of the 
whiners you've described... who couldn't find their way from Qeynos to 
Halas at 65th without a personal escort, who think fighting without 
kei/temperance is suicide, etc... but there are plenty of us who are 
exactly like you, dedicated, competent players ... except we don't raid. 
Some because we don't like to, and some because we -can't- due to RL 
scheduling, and play time. We don't like the dumbing down of the game 
any more than you do. But we don't appreciate being stonewalled out of 
ever greater chunks of it simply by virtue of the fact that we 
don't/can't form up in groups of 70+ people.

Yup. Thankfully, I'm not one of them.
