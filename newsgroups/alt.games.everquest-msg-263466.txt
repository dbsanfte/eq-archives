Not having instant travel works pretty well when you are in "explore"
mode.  My wife and I undertook the long, arduous journey from
Butcherblock to Qeynos early in our careers... journeying by boat...
finding someone to bind us (before the convenience of soulbinders)
seeing new areas for the first time.  At whatever level we were (10?)
it was pretty exciting.

But now, when I sign on and ask my guild what's going on, and we
decide to meet up someplace to play, the last thing I want to do is
spend my first hour getting there.  Eliminating quick travel (and by
that I mean ALL quick travel, ports, nexus, LDoN camps, Pok) would
make the game pretty much intolerable for those of us who only can
play for 2-3 hours at a shot.
