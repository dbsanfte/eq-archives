It took me about two seconds to get around that. Once you know the
name, just do a search for it. I use Google. The very first match was
a description of it, with a link to a place to download. Now, here's
the wierd part. The place it linked to was exactly the same as the
original posters link. But this time it worked (I also got the file
not found, originally). Just do a search, and you should be able to
get it without a problem.
