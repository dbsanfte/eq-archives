I was in the umbral plains with a 62 mage for the first time ever, seeing if
we could get the elysian armour I'd always heard about. We were there about
2 hours in the 'safe' valley and didn't see any wandering mobs go in there.
Finally we found a time i could harmony so that we could single pull, drew
mob back to wall, and then whilst i was chain healing his pet, I noticed an
elder elysian just behind the mob we were fighting.

"Add" i say, and look over at the mage to see if he wants me to evac. He
flops over, and the first thing I thought was "I didn't know mages could
fd?"

The second thing was: "run away! run away!"

As a druid, I have been hit my mobs in PoJ and PoD, and whilst I'm sure
there are mobs that could kill me in one hit, so far they mostly do a fair
whack of hits but don't get me without summon. The new regen means i shrug
of those few hits i get before a tank can re-establish aggro because they
don't kill me outright, but I'm sure if I was playing against tougher mobs
or as a chanter, it'd be unlikely I'd see much 'healing'. Chanters,
especially when they charm uber mobs and solo DSP caves, are either alive or
dead in my experience.

Other classes, especially ones with weak heals (rangers!), seem to get quite
a benefit from this, but I don't really see any change in the difficulty of
getting a group, which would happen if soloing suddenly became much more
attractive. I think it's spared people a portion of the downtime of lfg, at
least for some levels.
