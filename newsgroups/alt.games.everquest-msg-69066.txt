  Some people with not-so-hot computers with no T&L (including people
using graphics cards you mentioned) are reporting good performance, so
I'm not sure the cards are entirely at fault.

  If you turn off dynamic lighting, from what you've said, I'd presume
your performance would return to acceptable levels... but I believe
that will remove the light generated by all environmental lightsources
and lightsources carried by PCs... could be crippling if you play a
nightblind race/class combo.
