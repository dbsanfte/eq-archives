Just note that strength, as goes the popular wisdom, has no affect on
how likely each swing is to hit.

Your weapon skill caps will be lower than those for melee classes no
matter what you do.  However remember that you won't necessarily see
other people's misses.  That warrior, ranger, rogue, whatever, will be
mising a lot of times too.  But they swing so much more often than you
do that the messages you do see--their hits--will come much more often
than yours.

They will be wearing a haste item.  You probably will not.

They will be hasted.  You *may* not.

They may be dual weilding.  You will probably have a shield in your
offhand.
