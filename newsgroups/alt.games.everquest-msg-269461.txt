Would not be likely to help much, as the name in the quest journal often 
does not exactly match the name of the NPC.  For example, I needed to speak 
to a Sir somenameorother according to the quest journal, but, his name is 
actually Knight-Lieutenant someoneorother.  Usually if you type in the name 
portion, that is enough anyway, but not always.
