The only problem with this is trying to move around Lagtonica.  It is 
impossible, even to the day to this post.  They have stripped the graphics 
down to the point where EQ Live now has the better graphics.  I turned on my 
flora today.  I died to a green because I could not get a spell off becasue 
of the lag.. A GREEN!!

Thats right.  It is rare.  Most of the quests are go talk talk to Jim, now 
steve, now sue.  Bring me back an apple pie. Great.  After running around 
for na hour. 2 cp.  Thanx

It really doesn't matter who gets agro since each player is pretty equal. 
In other words, I was wearing leather and could take almost as much damage 
as a plate wearing class.  You never really need to worry about who gets 
agro.  In EQ II, it doesn't really matter.

Thats right folks. No guessing.  They tell you right away what the level of 
the mob is, who he is, what he had for breakfast etc.  In other words.  No 
challenge.  Ever try to kill a blue and have him whip your you butt. Not in 
EQ II, you know right from the start who you are dealing with.  No worries.

Well, the rule in EQ II is you must kill the entire encounter before you get 
the prize.  All mobs must be dead.  There is no, trying to figure out how to 
single pull, sneak in and get the prize.  Nope, not with EQ II, its their 
way or the highway.

Rush off in Lagtonica. Not on your life.

I always dreaded the patch notes.  It meant they had tried to fix something, 
which usually meant nine other things stopped working.  But hey, its beta.

This is called a 'linked' encounter.  You cannot break the group.  You 
cannot mez more than one mob every 18 seconds.  Thats right. repop on mez is 
18 seconds.  Tell that to the tank.  You can't pacify, you can't harmony, 
you must follw the EQ II story line.  Or you will not finish the encounter.

This arrow system was established after beta had started and was not part of

I have soloed two up arrows that were blue to me.  2 up arrows means a 2 grp 
encounter.  I never ran across a 2 up arrow mob that could not be killed 
with a single group.

Thats right gang.  Somebody dies, EVERYBODY takes the hit.  I tell you 
though, death penalty in EQ II has basically zero meaning anyway, so who 
really cares?

Yes gang, another encounter where they killed all the named, got the booty, 
and lived happily ever after with only one death.  Why not?  They tell you 
the level of the mob, how hard he is, what type he is.  Is the group linked, 
can you pull safely yada yada. They do everything but play your character. 
I felt like I was being led around by a brass ring in my nose down the EQ II 
storyline path, by a goblin who was laughing at me.
