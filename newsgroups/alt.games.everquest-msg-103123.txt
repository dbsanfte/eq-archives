Ok, Einstein, what, exactly, would be "proper" research for parents to do on
EQ?  Should parents have a degree in computer science and an MCSE before
allowing their kids to play any game?  The box (I assume, correct me if I'm
wrong) says that it's relatively "kid-safe" if they're 13+.  Are they
expected to do a lot of internet research for a GAME that's already rated
clean?

Parents are worried about sex, drugs and violence.  Why in the hell would
they also automatically consider how addicting a GAME (a GAME!) could be?

Buy a new keyboard, will ya?  I take responsibility for my own lack of a
life, I'm not talking about a warning for adults, I'm talking about a
warning for parents.
