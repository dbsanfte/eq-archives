I'm sure someone more knowledgable will correct me but ...

[1] Supposedly WIS affects successes and INT affects skill-ups.  Other 
traits like STR for smithing can come into play.

[2] As far as I know, CHA affects buy/sell price and no actual skill (just 
the cost of learning the skill).

[3] Couldn't begin to guess but I *think* skill fizzles go down 
significantly once you reach double the trivial, in your case 270 (yikes!).  
But WIS will also affect this.

Good luck!
