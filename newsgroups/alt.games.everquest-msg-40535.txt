Sorry about the off topic post but I feel it is important to get this info
out.

If you enjoy the DCMA law you should really enjoy the new bill that is
getting ready to be introduced to the house called the SSSCA.

Time to write your elected officials now before this piece of crap
legislation is rammed down our throats.
