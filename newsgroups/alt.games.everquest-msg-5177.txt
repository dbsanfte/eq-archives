I have a level nine monk, he has fought hand to hand since his inception.
Am I nuts for not training up his 1H blunt skill?  Will he cease to be an
effective character if he only fights with his hands and feet?  Are there
any pieces of equipment which augment his ability to do barehanded damage
(brass knuckles, studded or spiked gloves, etc.)

I really love the character but would hate to have to start retraining a
skill again (he's in the low 50's hand to hand).

Thanks
