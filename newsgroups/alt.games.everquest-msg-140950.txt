Gaak!?  VI has decided that necros are underpowered???
Any bets how long after this goes live that:
- hughes gets his wish and druids get CHeal?
- mages will be allowed multiple pets up at once?
- enchanters' dire charmed pets will zone with them?
- clerics will get a line of lure-based nukes?
- shamen will get rez?
- wizards get BL-type pet buffs for their familiars?
- the caster to melee ratio will become approximately 117:1?
(excluding bazaar mules, of course)


Kaev <-- may not be able to resist the lure of the dark side much longer
