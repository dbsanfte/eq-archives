As usual, I respect your input lance, but I could almost swear my monk
(without procing weapons) broke my wifes root (shes a wizard) on
numerous occasions... in fact, it was a little contention between us
because I didnt realize she had root parked em, and I was hitting each
to put aggro on me.

Id have to agree, the only reason Id bail on an adventure would be if
the group had a complete asshat in it, and at that point I would
attempt to reform the same group minus the asshat... 
Asshat qualification?:  Rude, uncooperative, know it all, loot whore

Lol, sub level 40 I consider a rez a complete waste of time... unless
its a friend with his level 60 + cleric just wanting to do it cuz they
were in the area and bored....
I can usualy make back most of the exp loss prior to rez effect
wearing off and rebuffing...
