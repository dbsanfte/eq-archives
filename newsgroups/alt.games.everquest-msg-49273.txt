I'm of the opinion that focusing on a person's poor grammar, spelling and/or
vocabulary in an attempt to gain some sort of tactical advantage in a usenet
debate is very trite, tiresome, and childish.  Especially a sort of
pre-emptive strike where a poster tells his adversary to look a word up
based on an assumption that he/she won't know what it means.

Best Regards
