And an acorn MAY become a tree someday -- but it's not one yet. That's up to
the vagaries of soil, wind, sun and rain. Maybe somebody will pick up that
acorn and use it to decorate their Thanksgiving centerpiece. Is it then
still a POTENTIAL oak tree or is it something glued to a piece of cardboard
with Elmers?

The truth is, you can't see the truth because you're all hung up on the fact
that Suzie Ann didn't go to the prom with you and got laid by the tight end
on the football team instead. Sex MUST be evil, right? And since Suzie Ann
got preggers by said tight end and got herself an abortion, SHE must be evil
as well.

Throw in a little biblical mythology and a really nasty case of the zits,
and we have YOU in an acorn shell. Right?

If all the women who have turned you down and got preggers by somebody else
and got abortions were laid end to end -- they'd make one hell of a party!
Why don't you go there instead of drooling over the memory of Sally Ann
here? Believe me, she wasn't a virgin anyway.
