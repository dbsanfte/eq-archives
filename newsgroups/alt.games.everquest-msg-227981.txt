That would make a huge amount of sense to me, FD that worked for
everything, eg you are DEAD.. just like it did pre lvl 35 when it
worked the mob would walk away and you could get up and /rude after it
and it continued walking.. And as bard I'd stand by you for wanting to
improve the skills you have rather than have to take a hand me down
from someone else.

It seems like sensible to me, after all most classes get an improvment
to their class skills in AAs, although many of the bard ones seem to
do crap all - bards dont use DD much so being able to crit on them is
some wasted AAs, ayones tutelage is not what it says on the tin, and
doesnt seem to improve anything, and then jam fest which means a song
you sing works better for you but not anything else.. well jee.. thats
useful but other than that, we get AA skills which make song stronger,
other classes get to improve damage, or extend duration.. why not you
get % increases to blurr on FD.. makes every damn sense.. Give that
man a free AA

Hand me downs are always disapointing
