Another good example of the law being applied unevenly where an
interpretation of the commandment is concerned. Apparently "keep the
sabbath holy" has been watered down to "don't buy booze on Sunday".

I haven't lived near an area like this recently that I'm aware of, but
as a kid growing up in the south there were a fair amount of towns
with similar blue laws, and even at that time I thought it was pretty
dumb.

Hmmm. Except I have noticed here in the Chicagoland area that car
dealerships aren't open on Sundays. I have no idea why that is, but it
was pretty annoying when I was car shopping.
