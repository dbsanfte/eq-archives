Yester I found some Radeon 7000 64MB PCI cards.
I was wondering what is this card equal too?  I've heard some say a G3,
others said a mix of G2 and G3, others said just a G2.  So which is it?
I had tried a G4 but didn't like my PC to well, so i went back to my old G2
card and now looking for something better and hoping a Radeon 7000 is
better.
