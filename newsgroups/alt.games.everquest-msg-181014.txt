Well I have both a SK and Monk both in the mid-30's

I admit they arnt pulling high end mobs but heres what I have found ...

Monks

- If the Mob can run at SoW speed (Or you dont have a SoW) you will lose
ALOT of your hitpoints or even worse Die before returning to your group as
you cant use your defensive skills with your back to the mob and Monk ac
just dont cut it.

- Manaless FD, Makes spliting those larger camps much easier as mana is
never a problem

-  Lack of any serious range weaponary or spells (I've yet to find a
throwing weapon with a range of 200 or more, but maybe i'm not looking hard
enough)

- Much lower Hp and AC means if FD fails you stand a good chance of not
getting back up

ShadowKnights

- FD is a spell not a ability this means
    1) It can fizzle
    2) It can be interrupted
    3) You can go OOM before casting it (through using your mana for other
spells or being drained away)
    4) AND it still has a chance of failing even when pulled off

- Lots and lots more HP and ac than monks allow for much higher
fail-survivability faction

- Interruption can make a multi mob split much harder

- Good choice of range weaponary and spells to pull with

- You can be an Inky and give us trolls something to gawp at in the newbie
zone =)

I'm sure there are far more Pros/Cons but thats all I can think of right now
