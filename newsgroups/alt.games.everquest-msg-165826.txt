I'd go farther than that.  Not only should names not be used as unique
identifiers...they should not even have to be unique.  It's getting pretty
hard to find a good unique name in EQ when making new characters, in both EQ
and DAoC, especially for those of us who try to pick names that fit in with
the character (e.g., my EQ characters have names appropriate for their race,
and my DAoC characters have names appropriate for their realm).

There would have to be a way to specify which person you mean for tells if
more than one person with the same name was on, but that is solvable.
