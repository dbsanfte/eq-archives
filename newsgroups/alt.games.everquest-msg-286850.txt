oh, i realize that, but thanks -- our pet is second only to the
druid's pet in terms of how much worthlessness it represents, and
that's from a DPS point of view (their pet at least follows commands!)

as stated below, we don't get pet hold, but i wouldn't have an
animation out during a raid because it's just not worth the liabiltiy
(for how low dmg it is) and besides, it would probably die to any AE
(Vish...Vulak...VOX! they die...)
