I would definately recommend a Barbarian Beastlord. Definely the easist
class I have soloed. There is a small difficult patch from about 11 till you
hit 15, but from then on things are quite sweet.

Barbs get the great advantage of starting in Everfrost, get out there and
whack the bears and use the white pelts for the quest with Cindl in McKilts
(sp?). The high quality skins you sell to tailors. Definately a fast road
when your starting from nothing as a true newbie.

I restarted my Beastlord as a Iksar which is even more fun (regen, forage)
but you stipulated no evil characters : /
