I don't want there to be a primary specialist class for everything.

I grouped with 'em during the kunark era when SKs where pathetic tanks
even compared to a monk and I remember early PoP when those same SKs
where godly. The arguement that they should've known what they were
getting into carries no weight with me. Not in a game like EQ where
characters had 100s of days played and the rules changed every
expansion.

Can't be done, at least not in a setting where you have 16 classes and
6 group slots. On the one hand you preach diversity and on the other
hand you aren't bothered by the fact that there's a class that's the
best tank, the best healer, the best crowd control. I don't get it.

One man's cake is another man's fucked up game design. ;-)
