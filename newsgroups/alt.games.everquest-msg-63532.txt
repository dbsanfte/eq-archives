Okay, I am gonna post this now, as i have been forced to log for a
day, and I KNOW you all are here as well 8p

My monk is in his early thirties, and i have a question about melee
damage.

HE had been given a jade mace by a friend of mine, who left to play
DAOC, and a wus armor suit.

Anyway, for the first ten levels he was dishing out the full damage,
bout 20 a shot.  Now, at level 30, he can put out about 25 a shot,
maybe 30 if its the luckiest shot ever.  I know that 9 18 isnt the
highest damaging weapon out there...but i havent seen any higher for
that delay.  I could get a high damage 2 hander, but there goes dual
weild and the delay will be like twice it is now. GRRR

My question is this...at level 40, will it even be possible to put out
enough damage to hurt a mob?  IS there some melee bonus for a level or
something, cause if not i dont see the point..that maybe melee is just
a song and dance man to distract the mob from the magic.  CAsters are
easy..they know that at X level, they get Y spell with such and such a
damage.

Please help me figure this out!
