Hiyas

I am looking at buying some fine plate armor, the stuff made by players
which is dyable. I have a question about dying this armor, can it be done
(or is it done) after the item is created? Some one I kinda know is offering
to sell me a set which is undyed, and he suggets it can be dyed at a later
stage, is this correct?

Thanks in advance


Ben
