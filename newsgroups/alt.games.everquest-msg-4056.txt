1. They used to do that?
2. You're wrong.

(I tried the game while I was visiting/living with my now ex in the US
for a couple of months. I got to lvl 39 before my flight home because
I unexpectedly found myself with a lot of time I desperately needed to
kill :(  So, I had him keep my names and my gear in the event I should
want to play again when I got home. And I wouldn't need a corpse
exploit to transfer gear; I had no nodrop stuff, and I had friends for
item transfer :p )
