No, it really hasn't.

If you think everything was all rosey back then, you're deluding yourself.

About 3 weeks after release, I had a much higher level enchanter (all of 14
maybe, wow!) tell me that if I gave him my sword, he could "enchant" it and
make it magical. (My partner wanted to do it, since a magic weapon would
allow us to kill wisps)

/consent did not allow you to drag another person's body, it allowed you to
*loot* another person's body.  The predictable thing happened, with alarming
regularity.  "My corpse fell down a tree pit in Blackburrow, and I couldn't
get to it, and this guy said he had found it and I should consent him so he
could bring me my things, but he logged off after I did and hasn't been seen
again."

etc, etc, etc...
