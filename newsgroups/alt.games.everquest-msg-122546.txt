Large Yellowjackets spawn much more frequently near the fork in the path
inside the wall. Don't bother tracking, logging another alt though, as
they will be gone by the time you get back on. What you can do is level
your Ranger until it can kill them, then track, kill and if loot you
want is there, then log and go get it. Be prepared that the loot might
not be still there as competition is high in Misty for these quest
items. Many times I went to corpses my Ranger killed only to find the
nodrop items already gone.... You have to be quick!!
