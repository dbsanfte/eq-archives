Here's where we have a fundamental disagreement. IME, the main use for
something like bible study isn't to learn anything, it's an attempt to
organize facts that don't make sense into a religious framework that's
already there and won't be questioned. 

As for "meditating on one's navel lint" that isn't religion, that's
tequila causing it! :p

Sure,. They're quite willing to use those terms when something happens
that doesn't fit into their personal biases. God is unknowable when
something happens that doesn't fit their faith. How many are willing
to take the extra step and question whether their basic assumptions
about God and religion are correct? 

For me, that really is the root of my problem with the religions that
I'm familiar with. It sounds absurd to me that people are quite
willing to concede that God in unknowable in certain contexts but when
it comes to the basic questions of God they have it all figured out.
