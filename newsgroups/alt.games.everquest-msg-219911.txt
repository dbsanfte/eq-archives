little men in black suits come to your house and install EQ back on your 
machine when you aren't looking. then they hide under your bed and tell 
you stories of greatness your character can achieve if only you play for 
a little while longer. they tell you that you don't really need those 
other hobbies or a so-callsed social life - all of your real friends are 
online and if you really wanted to meet them you could just go to a fan 
faire and of course you always wanted to go to a fan faire. you even 
have this really cool outfit you could wear at the fan faire that looks 
just like your character's favorite outfit and the men in black suits 
say that you look really attractive and of course their are available 
members of the opposite sex there at fan faires so you can go and pick 
up someone who may even think you are l33t... but you can't go to a fain 
faire until you get this ne more piece of uberness just so no one will 
laugh at you, so you really need to play just one more time for just one 
more hour. really. not long at all.

And you wake up playing EQ as addicted as you ever were.
