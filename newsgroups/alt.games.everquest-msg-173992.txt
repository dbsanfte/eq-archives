It wouldn't be "genocide" as currently defined. The US people are
smart enough to distinguish between the radical Islamic extremists and
peace abiding Muslims.

It would most likely go down like this...*Anyone* that rattles a
sabre, speaks out against the US, or encourages/harbors those that
even hint at conducting violence against the US, quickly becomes a
smoking hole in the ground. Along with everyone in the close vicinity,
collateral damage be damned. It won't be pretty, but it won't be
genocide.
