My understanding is that you can't get quest xp on mobs that are grey if you
are grouped? Otherwise i guess grouping would be the only way to go. I was
fighting grey mobs along with a lot of others and we just got in each others
way because we couldn't group and get the credit for the quest. (I was 18,
the others were 19 or 20)
