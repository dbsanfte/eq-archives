Exp is good when grouped with an enchanter. You snare and set up ya quad
kite, chanter tashans to lower mr and you both cast your AoE's, the spells
hit for more damage with the lowered MR and kills are a lot quicker so you
can kill more, especially so with the clarity, GoM and insight given by the
chanter

Good hunting
