it can be done, but i'd never say there's a perfect method (heh, what's
perfect?)

the biggest issue would be pathing, because in smaller instances of this
case, i have seen things path wrong and then change/lose aggro

i'm going to try to pull broon, grimfeather. a guard, and a gypsie (EK)

i'm gonna do this testing

i'll pull them all to aggro me, and i will wander around and hope to loose
aggro by attacking more and more singles, until we can use pathing ('ll be
using snare/root/charmsow/ to keep them in line) to shuffle through the mobs
in our masterlist and then engage only those we choose

or sumptin
