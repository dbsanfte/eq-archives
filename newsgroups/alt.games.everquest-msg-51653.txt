I don't know if you remember I challenged myself with this
a few months back.  I have a Gnome wizard with 2 pieces
of twink gear, one of which is a complete livesaver that I got
her at level 6.

The only gear she has is 8 backpacks, one Dragoon Dirk,
and a pair of Traveler's Boots.

She is completely naked...as in not even cloth armor.
She has never died one single time since level 5.  I don't
fight caster mobs or stupid undercons like D'Vinn and
others of his ilk.

She is now level 37 and has never died one time, and
never grouped with another class of any kind ever.
Constant never-ending SoW makes her unkillable,
and she can take down blues, evens, yellows, and
low reds with just a bit of med-time inbetween.

Having a main as a rogue, the ease at which she
levels and earns cash sickens me.
