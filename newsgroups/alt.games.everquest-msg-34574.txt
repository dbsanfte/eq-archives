Honestly, it shocked the hell out of me.  I'm thinking, "what post did SHE
read?"

The "girl" proved herself to be dishonest.  People don't change such a basic
trait overnight....stuff like that takes months, years, decades or longer,
if ever.  We're not talking about a character, we're talking about a real
person.  I wouldn't knowingly hire someone who is dishonest and I certainly
wouldn't want them in my guild, either.
