Or people who have access to a fast connection.  My recollection was that I
downloaded the DAoC beta at work and burned it to a CD to take home, for
example.

This probably won't hurt them much, becuase at their end (or rather, at
their ends--client and server), all internet connections look the same
operationally, just varying in bandwidth and latency.  They will need to
test the following cases:

1. low bandwidth/high latency user doing ordinary stuff...running around,
dealing with NPCs, etc.

2. low bandwidth/high latency user fighting, solo and in group.

3. low bandwidth/high latency user on a raid.

4. Many low bandwidth/high latency users on a raid.

These first three they can cover internally.  Probably #4 also.

Basically, broadband vs. dial-up is an area where there are not likely to be
many serious bugs, if any, if it works on the simple cases, which they can
test themselves.

As for why they might not offer a CD at this point, they might expect a lot
of big patches, making it impractical to beta test if you can't do large
downloads.  A beta could go through stages where there are large daily (or
more frequent) patches.  A 33k dialup can download about 10 MB/hour.  It
doesn't take a lot of patching to have your dialup testers spending all
their time downloading rather than playing at that bandwidth.
