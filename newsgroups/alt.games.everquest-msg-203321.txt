I could be wrong (haven't used pine for a while), but I don't think so. 
Pine doesn't have built-in filtering functions, relying on procmail to 
do mail filtering for it, so I don't think there is an easy way to 
filter Usenet posts. Of course, a bigger Unix-head than me could 
probably come up with a way to pipe nntp feed through procmail. :)
