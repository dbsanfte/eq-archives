You get into pickup groups at L22 where the buffer xp'ing with you can

AA is a mirage.  It doesn't really exist.  At least not for those of
us who still live in the real world.  My main _might_ ding 52 this

and my play time is severely limited by commitments to my wife, my
children, my relatives, my non-EQ friends, and of course my work.
