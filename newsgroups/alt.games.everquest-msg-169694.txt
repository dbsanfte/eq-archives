Root is very annoying, it changes the way aggro works on the mob to Proximity
instead of hate list.  While this is workable, its not what your tanks are used
to, and can be troubling in tight quarters and on mobs with a small melee box.
Then it wears off, and the mob goes back to hate list... and you haven't had any
access to what that list was during the rooted portion of the fight (well, if the
melee were on it, that is).  Root also takes time and mana to cast, and you have
to have someone who's dedicated a spell slot to it.

Its not impossible to adopt a root policy, but it can be aggravating.

If you, the enchanter, are going to do the rooting, then why not mem blur
instead?  Takes the same spell slot, similar mana, and instead of adding hate,
subtracts hate.  Then when your tanks go in with a single taunt, odds are good
that whatever hate there may still be left for you will be overcome.

If you have a paladin going in, instead of root I'd reccomend a stun, very
annoying to the mob, and it keeps it locked in place for six seconds of taunting
and melee, usually plenty of time to firmly cement aggro on the pally, and its
exceptionally cheap, very effective tool that the pally should always have memmed
anyway.
