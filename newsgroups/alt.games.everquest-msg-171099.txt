I had similar problems with an Asus MB (K7T i think it was running an
Athlon 600mHz). The bios incorrectly auto-set the cpu core and i/o
voltages. Once I set them manually, all was smooth. It too was running
fine for a few months oddly enough, and either it would stutter or
just crash to the desktop. Also, as we all know, sometimes having the
latest drivers isnt neccesarily a good thing. As someone mentioned
above, NVidia seems to blow a driver here and there (as MS does with
DirectX - no shock there). Did you upgrade any drivers or directX or
flash your bios recently?
