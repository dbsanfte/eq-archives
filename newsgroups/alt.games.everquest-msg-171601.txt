There are actually two ways to get to Paludal from Shadowhaven.  For one you
drop in some water off a thin bridge and then go through an underwater
tunnel to a spot where you drop into Paludal.  The other is the easier of
the two.  You just go across a wide, wooden bridge and zone into Paludal.
It zones to a very popular area where you should be able to find a group.
