Hey, we can't help it if *they* agro on *us*!

Here's a great example:

I'm fighting in PoD and I want to pull a Vetri Fly.  Well wouldn't you
know it, about four of them agro.  Then to add to that, the 4 tachian
flies agro as I run by their island�.and *then* when I'm running back
to my spot I agro at least one rat and a malarian larve agro on me�and
don't forget the 8 tsetsian flies that decide to join the fight as
well.  When that happens I'm left with two choices:

1. Fight
2. Flee

I decide to stand up to them.  However, I make every attempt to
persuade one of those flies to do the fighting for me.  They usually
comply but every time they are about to die they decide they don't
want to fight for me any more and decide to come after me.  To teach
them a lesson, I destroy them while I chose who else in that pack may
be willing to fight for me.
