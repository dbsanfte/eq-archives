How do you use the channels? I think I missed that patch.

And also I'm not so worried about being ripped off, but wasting time & money
buying something when the only reason I didn't get something better was
because people refused to tell me what is better and should be sought after,
and that I was just on at the wrong times.  I'm still not sure what I should
be looking for.  So far the main replies I've had are "stuff" "more stuff"
"necro things" "+INT" and the most common, "look at the /bazaar".  A few
have mentioned focus items, but is that truly all?  Just focus items and
INT?  What about +Mana?  +AC?  +HP?  How important are they and how much is
needed?  And has the Bazaar been made yet so that we can list either in
alphabetical order, or order of highest stat, or lowest cost (just like you
can list in order all files in a folder of Windows just by clicking that
category in the bar at the top of the window).  This would REALLY make
things much easier to work with and find the best prices and stats.  That is
the main reason I've not been so sure about it was I kept getting a list
that appeared to have things just randomly thrown together with so little
order it wasn't worth looking through unless you knew the exact name and
searched for that only.  I've heard they've made it better.  How much better
(as in what new organizational or user friendliness features)?
