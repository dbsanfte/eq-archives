Heheh.. you guys could be forgetting one particular vital ;piece of
info!!

The 'owner' of that account, may not have even posted that auction!!

I would NEVER do this... but it would be a great way for you to get
back at someone if they really pissed you off in  game..

Place a auction for their character then post a message in usegroups
about it and hope that VI gets wind of it and bans the owner of the
account.

I truely hope that VI doesn't shoot first and ask questions later!!
