Exactly. What Verant realizes, and apparently nobody else does, is that the 
time you are *forced* to invest in your character is what bonds you to 
him/her. It's that bond what makes you soil your britches when you have to 
do a naked corpse run in the middle of a dark, hostile dungeon. And that 
fear, that adrenaline, is what players relish.

Games that make it easy and painless on the player (AO, DAoC), will, 
proportionally, fail to create the same bond between player and character, 
and that is, ultimately, where the appeal of EQ lies.
