Ever see a real martial arts fight?

Quick, brutal, and over in only a couple of moves.

Same thing with knives, swords, and other close combat modes of
fighting. (Though I haven't see anything that violent first hand).
Gererally the first one to get in a solid hit, finishes the fight a
few seconds later.
