:> If you follow the ladder, you can get your smithing skill up a bit with that

Rusty Dagger + Sharpening Stone = Tarnished Dagger (Trivial 18)
Tarnished Dagger + Water Flask = Small Piece of Ore (Trivial 21)
Small Piece of Ore x 3 = Small Brick of Ore (Trivial 27)

Otherwise known as the poor man's method of smithing. But it can sure
be a hoot :>.

Also bear in mind the ore is able to be store bought and can be used
in any myriad of recipes that will take you up to 115. Dairy spoons..
lanterns.. banded armor.. etc.

On that same page.. hit Trade Supplies on the left and then your town
in order to get a loc of the vendor that sells a particular item. I.e.
the Sharpening Stone

Last, you take the fresh fish you caught and combine it with a Bat
Wing in an oven and spit you can make Fish Rolls that trivial in
Baking at 135.
