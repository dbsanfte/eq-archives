    You're allowed to install whatever you want actually. There's no law
around here saying a box has to go out with an OS on it, let alone an MS
"OS", and if there is where you are, perhaps it's time to riot.

    Microsoft have quality control so appalling their OSes could be mistaken
for computer games.

Cheers,
