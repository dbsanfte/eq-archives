Ohhhh no.  Sullon Zek is going to be changed to allow 3 characters now.
Which means NOW the griefers, who pervioulsy had their reputations and the
threat of revenge to worry about, can start a NEW ALT every day if they want
to and train train train til Verant has to change the ruleset to enforce
Play Nice Policies that were previously only controlled by the players.  I
feel bad for the FV players for sure, I played that server alot before I
went to SZ.  I liked the limits on languages and alignment, as I never
thought I as a troll should be teaming up with gnomes and halfling, but
trying to eat them.  Sullon was alot of fun, and believe it or not most of
the people I meet are not the 13 year old griefer assholes alot of the
people outside SZ think populate this server.  If they are going to allow
multiple characters, they NEED to limit you to a single team, or sullon zek
is dead.
