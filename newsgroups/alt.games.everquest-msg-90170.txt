In General, if run is called run. However, I've been in groups where
run was called and I go, hey, i'm fm, stay and fight. Sometimes people
get a little jumpy. If I (cleric) am fm we can usually handle four
mobs even without an enchanter. But yes, I've seen many people die
needlessly when run was called and no one did. Let the warrior/pally
take the hit. If I rez one person we can be up and fighting again
quickly, If I have to rez the whole group its going to be a while.
