Yes, were pretty much hated everywhere. One of the challenges playing
a necro, is that were KOS to most NPC's outside our homes.
Its not even safe to approach other cities of evil races - some you
may be KOS to, just because you are of a different race (i.e. Cabilis,
Iksar home town)

It seems that having your pet up, makes people dislike you more. Try
to con NPC and guards first; if they are indifferent go ahead, if they
scowls at you, try to dispose of the pet before approaching.

Theres lot of quests to do in the Qeynos area to raise faction with
the citizens and guards. The Blackburrow gnoll teeth to name one.

Finally - dont bet everything on Gather Shadows, the duration is
random, and its so inconvenient to appear right in the middle of the
city guards :o)

Good Luck with your necro - they are much fun to play, all
difficulties aside.
