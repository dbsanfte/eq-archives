Ahhh french? Boy.. looks like that translator is on its last legs, or
were you just winging it?

Really all your bonus points should go into INT, not sure what you
meant by "randomly." Sounds like you blew some points.

I can't think of any low level stuff to give infra for night vision,
but the lowest level light source is right near the erud areas:

Fire beetle eyes.

Just stick one in an empty inventory slot.
Outside of that your gamma might not be high enough.


Let me find you a site which can help you more:

http://www.eqloft.com/index.php?languesite=fr

Forums there:

http://forumsfr.ubi.com/messages/overview.asp?page=1&name=fr_eqloft_eq

Not sure if you can post there unless you have the UBI account.


Weird.. I'm out of the loop because last time I checked EQloft was a
general French EQ site, now its suddenly property of Ubi soft and used
for their localized Europe versions, nutty!
