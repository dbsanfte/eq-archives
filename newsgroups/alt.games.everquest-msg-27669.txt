I don't think anyone clueful disputes that shaman slowing is more
efficient than cleric healing in pre-50 XP grinds.

But taking your argument to its logical conclusion, clerics would be
pretty much forced to solo their way to the 50's, when they suddenly
become indispensable to high level raids.  In other words, you'd have
damn few high level clerics in the game.  Wizards face the same
problem: inefficient in XP grinds, gods on ubermob kills, but at least
they solo better than clerics.

If your goal is to have enough clerics & wizards to kill ubermobs, then
you suck it up at the lower levels, and to hell with inefficiency.
It's still easy to advance rapidly with a "suboptimal" group if you
know where to hunt and how to play (and knowing that is a lot more
important than having the "perfect" combination of classes, IMHO).
