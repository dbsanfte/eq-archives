Well, has a half-elf,  I feel that Tunare is a whinger.  My ranger
doesn't feel the urge to protect the cutesy little wolves.  OTOH Karana 
Recognizes that there is a war on(with Bertoxx) and killing the Rabids
and any other overpopulation.. is a good thing.  Lightning doesn't
discriminate between healthy and sick trees, and neither do I.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
