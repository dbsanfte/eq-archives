    Yes, your mana pool is fine. Until you get raid-level drops, having
roughly a 1:2 HP:MANA ratio (unbuffed) is the norm.

    It does. That's what makes it so nice. Again, for an non-raid character
your mana regeneration is more than fine - MP III, a point of FT, and a
horse.

    The only item I see that could be swapped out for some benefit is the
cloak, for a Hiero Cloak or a Lodizal Shell Shield (depending on the market
on your server). Both those items have a Bazaar sale price that is
expensive, but more than attainable. The Lodizal is nice for the resists and
would become a long-term piece of gear for the EB, but can AGI-lock you into
certain gear (damn our inflexible dwarven hides!) The cloak you seem to be
questing based on your pack contents would be good, too.

> Any suggestions on what next to focus on?

    Level and AA's. Your gear is good to about level 61. At that point, when
your mana pres item stops working on your fast heal, you'll want to have
Spell Casting Mastery III to pick up the slack. AA's do very well at taking
the place of gear - SCM for Mana Pres, Mental Clarity for FT, Natural
Durability for HPs, Planar Power/IE for overall mana pool.

    So here's my suggested plan of attack. Get your level up to 61, and
along the way pick up the following AA's: Run III, any other three in
General, Mental Clarity I, Spell Casting Mastery III (VERY IMPORTANT),
Natural Durability III. That's 32 AA's, so that's a lot of work to keep you
busy. During that time, try and get grouped in a variety of different places
(PoP, Veksar, CT, LoY zones, AoE groups, etc.) and see what's out there in
terms of cleric gear drops. Every few days, do Bazaar searches on various
slots, just to keep abreast of what the prices are like for various items
and to get a handle on the relative rarity of things in The Bazaar. By the
time you're done you should know for yourself exactly what you want, you'll
know what places suit you best for hunting to 65, and you should have a
significant bankroll available to get anything you aren't able or willing to
camp along with the knowledge of how best to spend that money. Good luck!

    James
