I have tried to make a grandmaster jewelers eyeglass 5 times and
failed each time at a cost of 4 to 5k per attempt. I have 250 jewle
making skill and a gem setter that adds 5% to skill. This just seems
too difficult. Did they nerf this or is it just nearly impossible. I
about ready to quit the game over this.
