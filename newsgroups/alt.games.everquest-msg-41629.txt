Maybe they didn't have a word for that concept then?  Besides, any century
in its first couple of years could be considered new.

Most definitely.  New York is the City of Uberhigh Rent.
(On second thought, NY might be considered the City of "God, what's that
smell?")

The ether was a little hazy that day.  Nosty should have banged on the set a
little to fix that cranky vertical hold.

The key words to interpreting prophecy are almost always "that's a stretch."

There's that stretching again.

Great could mean great in size, scope, power, etc.  Bush is the leader of a
great nation, hence he could be considered a great leader.

Perfect literal translation is very difficult.  There are idioms,
conversational nuances, and so on, that just don't translate.  Things like
jokes, which rely heavily on their structure, lose most of their punch when
translated.

It gives people something to obsess over so they can forget the tragedy
itself?  /shrug
