Well, then, it's no wonder you are leaving France, I'm sure that the crimes
of hating cheese, not drinking wine, or eating french bread would have a
stiff penalty.  :P

Unfortunately, I can't offer any help on solving your problem.  And I'm not
about to try to answer anything in French, as your English is a damn sight
better than my French.

Good luck with getting the problem solved.
