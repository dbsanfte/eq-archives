    Could have been a roleplayer.  My gnome warrior is prone to do this 
to all the big races.  And whenever she encounters someone in wolf form
with lev on she /em marvels at the floating doggie.  And yes, in (sorta)
real life I am well acquainted with the troll race...my Shaman recently
married one.
     As for as favorite race...well, I like the look of the dark elves.
The males I mean. I really think that its...unseemly the way the
females come naked, almost literally, in red bikinis, and then the butt
hanging thing that the melee classes get to endure their whole careers.
Ugh.  But I love the whole blue skin/white hair thing.
    As for playing, I have a hard time picking which I enjoy more (as 
anyone who looks at my sig can probably figure out).  I do like playing
the shorties...the illision of SoW is nice.  And wood elves..the 
foraging thing.  And the Barb because I like being a Shaman, and didn't
really like playing any of the evil choices.  
   Least favorite races I've played?  Eurdite; think the default robes 
look stupid.  Halfelves; think the females are ugly, and if you're going
to play an elf, just pull out the stops and do so.  And the one race 
I've never, ever played...human.  I play one in real life, and against
my will!
