There are too many Guilds to reccomend just one, and how good it is depends
on your play style, some guilds are strict PL (Power Leveling) some do only
Raids and some just like to play.  I personally do not like any guild that
restricts members to a certain lvl limit or which has required attendance
functions.  My most recent guild that I joined is primarily concerned with
LDoN adventures and playing as a group with other guild members.

Just target the NPC and press 'H' it should hail them, if they don't have
any words in [ ] then they dont give you a quest.

If the NPC says for example, I only talk to followers of [Mithaniel Marr].
Then you would type in, Who is Mithaniel Marr.
