It used to work, I understand it's been nerfed, have not tried.  What would
happen, is if the mob was up, your pet would target it, then you could
/assist, and see that it was indeed targetted, and therefor, up in the zone.
If the mob was not up, your pet, of course, would not target it.  If the mob
in question was close enough, your pet would also attack it.  Worked great
when I tried it a few months back.
