The last time I went looking for him (a long time ago, so this
information may have changed), he could be found wandering east of the
docks.

Follow the road from Kaladim to the docks. At a location of
approximately 1400 by 2000, there is a guard near an obelisk. Bundin
wanders the area south of here.

Take a look at the Butcherblock map at EQ Atlas:
http://www.eqatlas.com/butcherblockmap.html

Bundin wanders in the area roughly encompassed by points 2, 9, 17 and
10 on that map. He isn't always up, of course, so just check the area
regularly.
