Yep, I use to have to pull trains like that on A-holes that would see
me sitting at my camp medding and just start killing everything with
out even batting a eye in my direction.

Hell, just today some jerks do a camp check in Sol A and i reply
Lydina Room (I was soloing for my burning rapier item) , they ask if
she's up I say yes i'm medding up and they start hacking there way in
to her room while I'm sitting there!! After asking them why they think
they can snake my camp, the answer i got is "Because"..
Hmm I then proceed to run through all of the goblin side of Sol A
including every thing in the King room and ran them right into the
Camp stealers. 
Now I run out into Sol B down by the lava pit , zone back a watch with
glee as these dickheads struggle to run out all the way to the main
entrance to Lavastorm instead of just running down to Sol b which was
only one door and a hallway away.

Lets see,... One dead in hallway....one dead by getting stuck going
out through window.. One moron fell in lava.. One made it out.

And the Icing on the cake was they Killed Lyndia ( or whatever her
name is ) and they didn't get the chance to loot. Thanks for the
sparkling purse Assholes!!

/em cheers at you for taking a stand.
