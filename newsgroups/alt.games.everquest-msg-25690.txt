I was just wondering if anyone has ever used the program called everlogs 
for EQ. The things the program does, such as calculate your averages in 
many areas, looks very cool. I saw this on everlore.com one day. but later 
that day they was a news post, warning everyone about 3rd party software, 
and that some will steal your login/pass and sometimes are considered 
cheating and can get you banned. And am wondering if anyone has tried out 
this program. thanks in advance.
