Ooh I like this topic, haven't seen it in a few months now. I got a
strong opinion on this, maybe I can get Jazz and Lokari mad at me
again.

Well, yes.

Well they are doing the loot system wrong if that's the case. In a
formalized points system you're supposed to USE the points when you
get loot. That way when you get something good you move down the
ladder. That's the gist of the basic system, most guilds who do this
have it set up a little more complicated.

Assuming they do it right, they will eventually get to or near to the
top as people who go more get their loot. If they are going so rarely
that they are never getting to the top, well, they probably
*shouldn't* get loot in that case, in the most harsh way of
interpreting it.

That's really doing the points system wrong. If they are coming a
reasonable amount of time compared to the people going the most, then
they are going to get to the top or near the top eventually, and
people at the top will pass on some loot so they don't blow their
points on stuff they don't really want.

I understand that, but one needs, in my experience, to put up with a
bit of repetition to be fair to everyone.

Though I grew to despise some raids. Please god let me never again be
stuck down in the bottom of Thurg waiting for Dain to actually make it
down there....

This sounds like a very bad guild. No offense.

I think random loot is much, much worse than points. Random loot means
your joe shmoe who never helps on raids, only shows up when you are in
the one place he could get something, suddenly has just as much chance
to get that fat piece of loot as the guy who busts his ass, does all
the pulling, learning, and dying, and shows up even when there's
nothing to be gained for him even if they do win.

Honestly I have never seen random loot last long, as soon as the first
person has done more for a guild than someone else, random loot is no
longer fair.

But, in a guild where everyone is about even in seniority it can work,
for a little while. I wouldn't base a guild loot system on it though.

The best loot system I have been a part of is just raw merit by GM
fiat. If you have a good trustworthy guildmaster, just have him and
one or two other trusted officers give loot as they see fit.

If you can't trust your officers to do that, I would say find a better
guild.
