Well, we know that "I wonder if those chaps over there have us next on their
list" would never have played a role in the decision both to try to appease
Germany, and finally to oppose them.

Likewise, I see it as quite likely that Bush looks at the possibilty of Iraq
obtaining nuclear weapons, and realizes that the odds are in favor of it
meaning the death of many thousands of Americans, Isrealies, or Europeans,
as the very least.  All things considered, I think Saddam would use the nuke
on a European ally first, since he doesn't have a delivery system capable of
hitting the U.S.

If anything, 9/11 was a wakeup call to the fact that we have enemies who are
not bound by the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction.
