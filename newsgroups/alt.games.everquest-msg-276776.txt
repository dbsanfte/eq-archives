Ha! ha! Don't worry about it. We all know that as soon as we unpack the 
boxes of our own latest greatest gaming rigs even if they are absolute 
bleeding edge the day we unpack them, it will only be a short time before 
they are less than that, then midrange, etc. It's funny how you can blow a 
few grand for a high end gaming PC so easily (can you even get "high end" 
for that?) and yet the moment you boot that baby it up, it basically 
depreciates a full 50%.

I think to be truly high end these days for example, you'd really need an 
SLI video subsystem in your PC running a couple of the fastest video cards 
currently available, not to mention everything else in the box being the 
fastest, hottest, etc.

I wonder how SLI is going to do in the market. Dual processors never really 
caught on. And really, what is the benefit for all that expense when a 
current top end card can run any modern game at high detail, effects, etc. 
without lag. I guess it might be kind of cool to see EQ2 with display 
improvements no modern hardware is said to be capable of. I thought I read 
something about it being designed that way for the future. So I wonder if an 
SLI equipped box opens up some of the eye candy for view or not. But really, 
to a guy like me who remembers playing games where you could count the 
polygons on the fingers of your hands for the entire display, modern games 
look so good with midrange gear that it is pretty hard to justify anything 
more expensive than that unless you just happen to very well off and don't 
know what else to do with your money.

On the bright side though, I just bought a new PC, which is very nice but 
not leading edge by any means and I did get a PCI-E card for it. I wound up 
picking it up a few days later than planned and as fate would have it, the 
ATI board I had them put aside for me (an X800-XL) dropped $100. in price 
from the time I called to the time I came to make the buy. I guess a newer, 
faster, better, etc. ATI card must be in the wings which will push down 
pricing on the rest of the line from the top on down (not that mine was the 
top anyway). That's just fine with me because this will still be far and 
away the nicest system I have ever been fortunate enough to play on.

Thanks to Uncle Sam for giving me back a lot of my money this year and 
making this possible. I spent it wisely and I hope my contibution to the 
economy helps. :-)
