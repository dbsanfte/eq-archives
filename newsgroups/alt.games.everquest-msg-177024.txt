/shrug
You said no point in Druid with Cleric and Shaman, I was pointing out
that (as of my reply to your earlier post) Cleric was not a given and
Druid/Paladin was viable alternative to Cleric/whatever.

Then I saw that one of his bddies had decided to be a Cleric, and
cancelled the post you replied to here since it had become moot.

But since you want to argue about, er, discuss it, I'm game.

It's useful in more places than it is necessary, and if I had the
luxury of putting together a regular group in which we were all
working out how to coordinate a good set of strengths applicable
to all occasions I'd sure want an evacer/porter in the group.

If all you're talking about is whether a Druid should be added to Shaman
plus Cleric in a four man group, there's no point to this discussion
because I agree with you.

His wording "I don't think...", in the context of his post, reads to
me as a request for confirmation of his tentative judgement.  I wouldn't
have bothered pointing out the utility of ports post-PoP if he'd made a
clear statement of the sort you chose to invent.  :-p

Druid's a quite decent damage dealer if your group's tactics make use
of his abilities.  The reason I agree he's a subpar addition to the
Cleric+Shaman+two combo is that about the only class a Druid can outtank
is Wizard and once you're moving into the mid levels you want your
Cleric and Shaman to do as little tanking as possible.

Yes, I was.  And where you inferred Cleric requirement plus a total
disdain for ports, I pointed out that that the first was not required
and the second was (apparently) not cast in stone.

I agree(d) with everyting except your assumptions, yes.

Heh, you're reaching again.   :-p  His buddy took a Cleric, he never
expressed a preference that I saw.

Since we're all still sub-30 it's not all that relevant, xp loss is
so small that even when we've gotten a minimal xp rez it's been
unimportant.  And we're not a constant group.  The same four people
grouping every single time will develop a rapport that will have a
huge effect on their ability to cope when the situation fubars.

Rogue sneak does not negate the need for invis as it's (obviously) self
only.  Strictly in terms of what you can kill tho I'd rate SK/Rogue
high.  Of course, if they're planning to actually roleplay the toons
(he did say FV server, might have that in mind) then the SK and the
High Elf Cleric would spend so much time bickering you'd never get
anything done.

I still think that a Shaman+Druid+Paladin+BL|Monk|Rogue|Ranger team
would be tremendously effective as long as at least one of the players
was a decent tactician and all of them were reasonably intelligent.
