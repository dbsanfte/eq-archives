That necro is a bastard.  He'll only pop at night.  And he's shy, so if 
any of his friends are up, he won't come out.  You have to keep all the 
other spawns dead. I would keep the skellie at the bottom step of the 
obelisk alive till almost night time.  Then kill him and hope that the 
necro spawns on next spawn.  Keep killing all the other skellie spawns.

Make sure you bind at Gfay zone line, and gate as soon as you kill the 
necro.  Makes it easier to find the courier.  The courier won't pop 
until you kill the necro.

This page might help you some:

Good luck.
