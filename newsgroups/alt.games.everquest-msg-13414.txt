Start the Staff of the Wheel quest.  Avoid spoiler sites and try to
figure out the locations of the 10 rods from what you learn as you
explore Norrath, and it will be a lot of fun.

Nine of the rods are in places you can get to easily at level 20, with
little danger (other than that of invisibility wearing off at a bad
time).  Well, make that eight...one of them is somewhere that humans are
not welcome.
