I wasn't dissing Canni+Regen :-)

I was merely pointing out the fact that Canni+Regen isn't the same as
KEI. The other poster seems to be under the impression that Shaman and
Necros don't need/want KEI and do not fear a nerf due to their
hp->mana spell lines. While this may be true at the higher levels, it
certainly isn't at the lower levels where KEI has such a drastic
effect on game play and balance.
