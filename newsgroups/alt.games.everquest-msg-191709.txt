Because the rules say it's not allowed, and it irritates me when
someone is arrogant enough to think the rules don't apply to them.
It's not like they're hurt or even inconvenienced by making a
reasonable attempt at following the rule in question. There's no
reason NOT to make an attempt at it except to be a stupid
rebel-wannabe dipshit (Or willful ignorance, which I also have zero
patience for).
