Roll up a ranger.  =P

Centi is  15/32 5str 5sta 2 wis
DE is  13/32 however it procs a 14pt fire based DD fairly often (I have one,
procs 3-4times just beating snare-dead things down) 2str 5wis 20hp 20 mana
7sv fire

I'd go with the DE because of the superior wisdom/hp/mana/saves, and the
slight reduction in melee damage is offset some by the proc.

Seriously though, if fear-kite + melee damage is your primary killing
method, you might want to consider either changing tactics or becoming a
ranger. (although fear kiting does have its place
*cough*snowgriffons*cough*)

Also, since you're a human, I *think* the DE is a minor lightsource, I can't
really tell since I'm a wood elf with night vision, as well as having
something like 5 other lightsources on me.

(just for reference my equipment is listed at
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39316 , and no, I'm not a
twink, just lucky with the trading)
