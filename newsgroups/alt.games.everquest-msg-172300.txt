Need Before Greed.

The theory that if an item drops, and it is a true upgrade for a member of
the group that got the drop, it automaticly goes to the person who will use
it.   If it is an upgrade for more than one person, then only those who will
use it random for it.   If the item is not an upgrade for any group member,
then the entire group, reguardless of class or gear, randoms to see who will
twink / gift / sell the item.
