You see, this is what I am talking about.  You say 50 is light blue at 61,
James is saying 48+ is dark blue at 61.  Have you actually verified that
these static spawn level 50 mobs are indeed level 50?  From James' post, it
sounds like he actually conned players of known levels, not mobs, to get the
level range.
