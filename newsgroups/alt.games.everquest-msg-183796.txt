No, the degree only teaches you the basics. However, if the best
software developers wrote everything they knew and I read everything
they wrote, then I would. But, like I've said a hundred times, there's
a difference between KNOWING everything about a class and actually
having the skills to APPLY that knowledge effectively. The latter can
only be gained through direct use, however, the former can be learned
simply by reading what others share and talking to others.

Just because I *know* all there is to know about a class doesn't mean
I'm good at actually playing the class. I'd be better than someone who
doesn't know the first thing about the class by far, but details of
the facts about the class will only get you so far.

What the elitist idiots fail to be able to grasp is the difference
between knowledge and skill.
