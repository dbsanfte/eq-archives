A basic understanding of grammar is a "bad thing," and should therefore be
discouraged in any internet endeavor (not directed at you, directed at
PlayerX).

I read it as a "feel free to kill yourself" message.   But even if he meant
it as a threat, if you're thinking about possible criminal charges (or even
TOS violation), don't.  Unless some argument can be made that the guy could
possibly carry out his threat then there's nothing anyone would do about it.
