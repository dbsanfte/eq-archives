Generally from players only, but if you are lucky you may find some on
merchants near spider hunting grounds. Spiderling silk pops up quite
often on vendors in towns / newbie zones.

Fraid that Im not on that server, but you should be able to auction for
headys in your local auction zone (GFay, WC or NFP or whatever)
Metal studs are quite easy to trivial so you could make your own,
however it hurts. Having said that I expect that any smith would charge
punitive rates to make them for you since they are such a pain in the
butt.
