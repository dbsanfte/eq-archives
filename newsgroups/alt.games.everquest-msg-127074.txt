That seems more in line with what I've read.  I kind of figured classic
Greece was a bit before the coming of age of Islam.

It seems that the Moors were at the height of Islamic civilization.  It
would be interesting to study and find exactly where it took a downturn.  I
think the big difference between Christian civilization and Islamic, in this
respect, is that the Christians learned how to use God as an inspiration,
vice as an oppressor, while the Islamic clergy began to use Allah to their
own selfish ends around the same time.  One could almost say there was as
torch passed from the Muslims to the Christians.

Seems to be a reasonable argument.  It's not like an Islamic country's like
the Hotel Califonia; you can actually flee Iraq.
