Yep I have messed around a bit more, and after an evening schwacking
Golra's in TD, which were red to me at 20, I deshrouded and saw nuthin

On that,  I remember seeing an exp scale a LONG time ago up to level
60...basically the total exp value that you never see per level.  From
a percentage basis, lvl 60 exp was measured in 100's of thousands
while lower levels were in the ten and 1 thousand range.  So I guess
when you get a couple thousand exp at 20, it just doesn't make a
difference at level 70 (which must be in the 10's of millions...).

BTW, anyone got that scale, updated, for exp per level???

Still haven't gotten off 1%...hehe.  Just like others have posted.
Once it moves I am told, it will move good...

Hey thanks all for the info so far.
