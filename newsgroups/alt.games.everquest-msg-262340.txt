Yes you do.

Once the leader accepts the adventure, you will take a loss unless the 
goal is met; you will take a loss if nobody in the group zones in within 
the next half hour, and you will take a loss if the mission goal isn't 
met within the set time limit after the first person zones in; you will 
get partial credit if the goal is met within half an hour after the time 
limit expires, but this will still count as a loss (you'll merely get 
some points).

You will also take a loss, I'm told, even if the mission is a success 
but you aren't on line when that happens or within half an hour after it 
happens.  I can't verify this last; I do know that logging on after a 
success but within the half hour post success period will get you the 
points.  I assume this has something to do with the fact that the 
instanced zone stays up half an hour after a success.

I can also verify that you can get points (but count as a failure) if 
you are online but not grouped when your group makes a partial success.
