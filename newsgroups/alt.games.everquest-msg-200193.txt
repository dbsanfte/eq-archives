Hmm my ranger 44 spell required me to hunt nifiliks. It needed 2 drops
which took a total of about 15 nifiliks to get. For beach hunting that was
great for my level and gave me about 2 orange bubs of xp doing it and one
afternoon focussing on it.

At the right level a single group on the beach is going to be collecting
XP ike crazy - heaps of low aggro range, non social mobs...heaven. There
are a lot of quests...which can be used as filler. At least one beach
quest means a trip to Erudin (all of 10minutes work really) to pick up a
flourite earring...not bad stats on that.

At lvl40 a group of us hunted the zoneline in Dulak - in the process
getting a lot of xp, some nice drops (Mantle of shadows IIRC amongst
them). plenty of cash/cash drops. 

The ships are great and for non twinks like my main dropping useable
stuff (rust encrusted bracers). As is the harbour area.

I cant comment on PoP comparison though since Ihave nothing high enough
(though I need 1 blue bub and I dont say that anymore....) but for 35-45
its pretty good...though rangers - recommend you fear kite pandas and
granitebacks in Stonebrunt through those levels if you need solo time or
cant get a group in LoY zones.
