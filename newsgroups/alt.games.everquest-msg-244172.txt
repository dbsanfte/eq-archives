Ok dude.
I have /read/ the help file and followed some of the examples.
Each example requires the administrator password at some point.
Giving other family members the administrator password would defeat my
objective.
So, in your infinite wisdom, if you know a way around this, let me know.

Your answer was useful to me, however, because it showed me how to run EQ
from my user login without having to be Admin.
