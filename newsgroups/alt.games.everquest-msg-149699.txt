Charm solo in Chardok

Charm solo in Siren's Grotto  (so much h8 for molkor)

Root/Rot Howling Stones entrance or basement

Root/Rot Kael Bank if you have decent hp/ac  (I finally broke 2k hp self
buffed tonight, whee, and 933 ac)

Charm solo or Root/Rot in Maiden's Eye.
4-arms are especially fun; as long as they only chain nuke you, when they
start chain-annulling you it kinds sucks a lot.

Root/Rot Akheva entry

Root/Rot Phase Spiders in Dragon Necropolis entrance.  Have fun when you hit
a trap.

Train... err.. quad Toilers in Maiden's Eye.

If none of the above appeal to you, you may need to go requisition your
supply of phat lewts from Prince Thirneg in PoG.

All of the above are exceptional exp at 56.  (except Kael, but it has loot,
and I need a leather bp)
You want 58 so you can scribe Fist of Karana; I want 60 so I can scribe Mask
of the Stalker, so I'm kinda crazy in what I go kill.  My first try of an
Ice Burrower (yellow to 60) got it to 56% before I got bored and gated; I
did learn some things to do next time, so I'll be going to do that again.
