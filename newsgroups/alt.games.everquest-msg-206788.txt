    It's centered on the person with the most aggro. So as long as you're
sufficiently far from that person, you're fine.

    What he said. After you've died a few times to a mob, you begin to feel
like you sacrificed something to learn what you did and you want others to
have to make the same sacrifice, to "earn" it. Or at least you do when
you're talking with a random stranger - people will frequently share
information with friends.

    It's how the top two guilds on my server learn things. We're actually
behind other servers because of it, I'm sure.

    Which is why there's so many different ways of doing things across
servers, and even across guilds on a given server? Sorry, I call bullshit.
Even when you get a full spoiler from someone else, there's usually little
details that need to be ironed out that weren't mentioned in the spoiler.
Like Monual's hint about line of sight and High Priest - our clerics never
had an issue with it because we placed them away from where the AoE was
going to land. We learned this the hard way, by dying from being stunned so
much. We then went to Lucy, looked up the AoE info, and worked it out.

    Here I am. Name the encounter. I've been with the guild I'm in since
Luclin, so try to avoid things like "Nagafen" or "Cazic Thule".
