After toying around with DAoC for a couple of months I realized that the
atmosphere was just subpar compared to Eq.  So... I did what I said I would
never do and came back =)

I fired up my level 40 necro dusted off the ole bag-o-bones and started making
dead bodies soloing.  I heard that the DreadLands were good for my level, so
I went there last night and got in a group (a relative rarity for me).  
My primary role was fearing, and mana battery (a little new to me too).
Many of my dots wouldn't stick, and if the mob wasn't feared I got agroed big time.

I love my necro and the ability to solo even cons for most of my levels, but am
not looking forward to being a mana battery in most group engagements.  At this
point I am playing with the idea of an alt, but am not sure which would be the most
fun/useful in groups/raids.  Any suggestions?

Thx
