|    My necro is 20 - what levels would you recommend could solo Kerra, and
|roughly what areas? I WANT to go there, but The Warrens has been too much
|fun - and too easy. ;-)

	At 15, I did most of the spawns at the entrance.  Two cats right as you
come in, always a pair of Awrats (Shamanesses).  Then the two at the bridge,
always a pair of Mamluks (Warriors).  You get both of those spawns two at a
time but you can take them (at least I could).  Over to the right there's one
cat outside the merchant's hut, who I could pull solo (almost always a
Mamluk), to the left there's another hut with a cat outside but you'll get an
add, one Mamluk and one Awrat.  Then you pull the two Mamluks on the other
side of the bridge; you get them one at a time, they path into the stream and
after a bit of a pause will simply teleport on top of you.

	That area starts to green out at 16, so I started on the other side of the
bridge.  Clear out the entrance as above.  Go over the bridge and charge the
Ghulam (Warrior) on the far right, white to yellow at 16.  Facing out of his
corner, you've got a Mamluk/Awrat pair to the right, a pair of Mamluks far
ahead, the two Mamluks at your side of the bridge when they respawn, all blue.
Beyond the pair to the right, down the ramp, is an Ipsuar (Shamaness), white
to yellow at 16 and can be pulled solo at a distance.  Do NOT go down there --
you'll get jumped by four more cats (thx FD).  Beyond the fair pair is a
Ghulam, yellow at 16.

	Alishani just hit 18 last night and this area is starting to green out.
Beyond that far Ghulam you can take some pulls from the beach/dock area,
including some nameds (that don't seem to drop anything), but I'm still
learning that part.

|    Mezzing adds isn't required - there's (barely) enough space to root
|park. The only time multiples are dangerous is when they all assist each
|other on one PC - most pulls are pairs, with a possible green "add".

	Even if you're rootparking you'll need to keep your group assisting the
MT; beating on a rooted mob is tanatamount to beating on a messed one, as you
will cause the root to break early.

|    Only ones near a shaman-mob, which by and large is deeper in.
	
	Seemed to me that every single dog ran faster than me.

|    The other issue for us is pet aggro. Your pet is generally lower level
|than you, so at lower levels you're pulling the aggro of someone a few
|levels below your level whenever Jobaber attacks.

	I always left the pet parked in a cleared area and pulled to it.  I wasn't
interested in EP really, just wanted to make Amiable with Heretics so I'd have
a Paineel key.  It didn't bother me that I was killing greens most of the
time.

|    All you need is Clinging - it doesn't have to last long, just long
|enough to bash the mob down to walking speed.

	Clinging is still fantastically more expensive than Snare, especially when
you consider that it lasts 30 seconds to Snare's two minutes.  It doesn't
debuff move speed nearly as much, either.

|    There's a nice network of "pull spots" in the zone.

	So I noticed.

|    They don't need raid protocols. Tanks, healer(s), snarer/nuker. Snarer
|preferred. What they DO need is a group, or some quality twinks.

	Well, I disagree.

|    Remember, we play the alts because there's nothing for the Primary to
|do. ;-) 

	Oh, there's always something, especially if you're in a good guild (which
I am; Arbiters is one of the best on E'ci).

|In my case, I'm sticking with the Warrens not only because the
|rewards are high, but also to learn how to handle a pet class in a dungeon,
|something I've never done before.

	The rewards are not that high.  I can do better for cash if I go farm
Wisps in WC.  The items -- which I couldn't get anyway -- are not that good
for the most part.  (Yes, the 3 INT cloak is an exception, but frankly I don't
need one that badly.)  And I started a Magician 2.5 years ago (and hardly
played her since), so I had a good idea of what pet control was like.

|    Been there, done that. It's actually better when you're alone - the
|trains can be horrific otherwise.

	No kidding.

|    Muglwump is a real piece of work. He Rampages. I nearly died laughing
|the first time I saw that - figured it HAD to be a mistake. Bet the druid
|was after the Cast Iron Stein (5/31 1HB, AC 3 STA 2 WIS 3).

	The one time I zoned in to find a Muglwump corpse at the zone, the Stein
was the only thing on it.

	Muggy is the final piece of the puzzle, the last clue that this is
intended as a raid zone for characters in their teens.  *HE'S A DRAGON.*  For
a bunch of high-teens/low-20s characters, going after Muggy is like the
45-50's going after Naggy.  The Warrens is some cretin's idea of SolB for
low-level characters -- except now that they don't have to, no one wants to
deal with SolB, either.

|    I would, and have. Assuming you aren't a puller, what else will you put
|in your ranged slot as a tank? It's AC 1 STR 2 HPs 4, which isn't
|exceptional but isn't worth sneezing at.

	It's worthless, those numbers will have no statistical effect on your
performance.  If I wanted a range slot item for a twink fighter class and for
some reason wasn't using a bow, I'd use a Runed Bone Fork for the resists, or
a Medicine Totem for the AC.
