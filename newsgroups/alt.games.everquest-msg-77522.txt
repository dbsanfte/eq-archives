Although my warrior has surpassed my Chanter in levels, I still consider 
Zymyool my main.  Chanter is a challenging or even very hard class to play 
until you figure out -how- to play them.  I figured it out by reading here 
and by reading a guide someone wrote to playing an enchanter.  If anyone 
knows where that is, I'd love to link to it from an upcoming post to our 
guild's message board.  I have a hard copy, but not the URL.  Please post 
it if you have it.

Chanter is very exciting, especially somewhere where there are wandering 
adds and a puller that doesn't mind bring back 4 friends with the target.  
I finally started getting that "chanter rush" when I was in the Sarnak Fort 
in LOIO and we pulled 6, with most of them being white or yellow to me.  
Felt great to finish that battle off with no loss of life, but everyone 
down to about a bub of HPs and OOM - knowing that it would have been a 1-
minute TPW instead of a 10-minute battle if you hadn't been there.

Chanter can be boring in somewhere like The Overthere where you can 
position your group for no adds.  Unless someone is chain pulling, you can 
fall asleep as a chanter.  No casters there to stun, and no adds unless you 
want them.  *yawn*

Bards are a challenge, as someone else said.  Last night, we were in 
Kaesora ( 39 WAR, 39 WAR, 40 CLC, 39 MNK, 35 SHM, 39 BRD ) behind the 
Library, and the bard [ Rhapper ] did an incredible job of Mezzing, 
Charming, Stunning, just like he has been doing for the last 4-5 levels 
with us.  He is a great Bard player and is -always- busy because he is 
playing the role of Chanter with us.  I am in awe of what he does, even 
with the experience of playing a chanter to level 36.  He is very key to 
our group.
