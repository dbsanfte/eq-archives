Depends on your goal.

Tradeskills can be profitable - though SOE has taken most of the profit out
of most of the tradeskills now though. You can also make some fairly nice
stuff. Black Acrylia weapons for all smiths, some VERY nice cultural armors
for some races. Tailors have some nice cultural items plus tailored armors,
weight reduction bags (halflings have a 100% weight reduction bag they can
tailor), Bakers have the Miraculous Meals they can make for stat
enhancement - the list goes on.

If you are only interested for sake of the trophy, then brewing or baking
would be my suggestion. They are substantially cheaper to GM than the other
trades are - particularly for foraging classes.
