The interface for beta 4 was identical to that shipped, and yes it had
hp but not mana numbers. If I remember right, that part of the interface
even looked quite similar on some old screenshots on Gamespot or one of
the older web sites preview of everquest as well. I remember it had a
screenshot of Aradune, with the hp and resist displays, and the
inventory very similar to the shipped one though the graphics were way
cruder.
