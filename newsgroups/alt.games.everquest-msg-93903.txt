Looking for somewhere to add this, although the figures are accurate I
believe that the exp. bar is meant to be or is a 3d object, so the 5 bubbles
are convex. This means that when viewing from the front that blue bar is
actually moving into the dips inbetween each of the bubbles, you see it slow
down but really it is moving the same speed you just can't see the distance
it's moving inwards and then out again. Thats my theory anyway prolly crap
but I certainly agree it seems like the bar moves slower over these points.
