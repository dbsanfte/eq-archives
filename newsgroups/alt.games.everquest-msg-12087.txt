It's scary but true, it is apparently possible to solo to 50 without ever 
going in a dungeon, learning proper group tactics, or even talking to 
anyone.  I used to think that Norrath was full of Ebay idiots, but it seems 
that some people will just stick to solo (or pair) hunting outdoors, and 
never ever learn the skills that they will need for the Planes.  I spent a 
little while in the Lake of Ill Omen and I simply could not beleive what I 
was hearing sometimes.  For instance, I once heard a lvl25 guy shout, "How 
do I get a better weapon?".  A little later, the same guy shouted "How do I 
buy things?". Quellious save us.
