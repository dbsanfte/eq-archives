We were in ToV right after the patch. We were wiped out once, but got
a cleric with her epic camped out so the CR was pretty easy, except
for two people. Their corpses were at the zone-in (we were pretty deep
in at the time of the fight). After everyone else was CRed, we gated
back to the zone-in to res those two. The corpses were too far away to
res. Even though they showed up on screen as being right next to us,
the game thought they were still back where we had been fighting.

It took a while, but eventually we got them rezed.
