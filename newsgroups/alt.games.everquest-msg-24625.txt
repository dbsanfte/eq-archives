Definitely sounds like a bug.  I keep a map of TD around, and usually hop
off the boat as soon as it zones, and head to the pots in TD to tp to the
city of my choice now.  I have not experienced the problem you did, but last
night I did camp on the ship in Iceclad, got back on, only to find myself
somewhere at sea, no ship in sight.  Fortunately I had a map of Iceclad, and
just hoofed (had levitate going) it over to the island the ship takes you
to.  Later on I camped sitting amongst the merchants on said island, when I
got back on, I was on the dock.  Something weird seems to be going on there.
Next time, if you find yourself in an unknown place, camp out, get a map,
find out where you are, and if you can just get to where you want to go that
way.
