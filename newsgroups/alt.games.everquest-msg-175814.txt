The chunks of meat are edible, the wolf/bear/etc meat must be cooked in 
some form before they can be eaten.

You can buy bread at the beginning - sandwiches (one bread and one meat 
in the oven, combine) have a low trivial rate, so you'll succeed fairly 
soon.  But personally, I'd go check the bazaar and see if someone has a 
filleting knife, or if someone would make one for you, for a couple 
plat.  It's a one-time cost, see.  Pop it and a piece of meat in an 
oven, hit combine.  If you succeed, you can get more food than with a 
sandwich by filleting wolf meat - each successful combine makes 10 
fillets!  Two successes and you'd have a stack of food.  Problem is the 
trivial is higher.  But just keep popping your food in the oven and 
hitting combine, you'll get better at it.

Also, if you have Planes of Power, whenever you're in PoK, check the 
vendors around the baker area, and around the fishpond area.  Sometimes 
they'll have fish rolls that someone has sold to them after skilling up 
on them, and they cost about 1 gold each to buy, iirc.  A massively good 
deal, because they are a banquest sized meal, and last much longer than 
either the sandwiches or the fillets.  They also have a semi-high 
trivial, so if you want to make them yourself, start saving up fish and 
batwings.  One batwing + one fresh fish = 1 fish roll.
