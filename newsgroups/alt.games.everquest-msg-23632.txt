Velium Battle axe (1hs version) - 8/28
Crystal Fiber - 8/26
Blackened Alloy Long Sword - 10/29 +3sv pois (might be a little expensive
for you though)
or save up for your Ghoulbane - 15/34, procs Dismiss Undead at level 20,
necessary component for Epic.(and it is 1hs)

You really ought to work on 2hs, since that is what your epics are
(SoulFire, Fiery Avenger/Defender)
for that I suggest (within your price range)
Axe of Iron Back (GREAT weapon until the damage cap comes off, I know its at
20 for Warriors, not sure on hybrids) - 16/37
Maybe a Blackened IRON Bastard sword (20/47), but I would save for the Alloy
version 24/39 +3sv pois
or better yet, save for a Mith2hander - 21/40 perma-haste (equiv to around
21/30, with the 40+delay dmg bonus), can usually get them for 500-1k (or
sneak into Lguk and try to buy one cheap off the group camping the king,
still too much for you right now)
