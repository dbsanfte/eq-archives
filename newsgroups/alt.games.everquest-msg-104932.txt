I have the exact same problem. My guild finally got to TOV some time
ago. To me this was great and pretty much us working at the pinnacle
of our ability. Besides that, tov is great for equipping everyone.
Once some particular people, the main raiding people, had all of their
tov armor coincidently (not) it was suddenly time for us to move on to
bigger and better things like killing first brood dragons or whatever
for sleepers keys. Also at that point we were suddenly told we are now
pro giant, which for many of us more casual types is kind of a big
deal since we don't have all our Tov skyshrine armor yet. From the
maximum kos point we are at, switching to giant faction is definately
not a casual endeavor either. All I have to go at this point is my
druid bp, so If I got the giant drop one I'd definately see building
the faction worth it (because I have not got the skyshrine one in all
this time) but I still don't like this pressure of going on to all
this new crap all the time when I'm just getting into the old thing.

Its just never enough for some people and once just they and a few
others have exhausted the reward of an area they want to move on.

Ahaha let them go, then listen in guild chat how they got seriously
owned.

I agree. They always say stuff like "oh we won't know if we try" or
this or that.

Say you know you are not ready and stay out. When they get owned there
say "Exactly. "
