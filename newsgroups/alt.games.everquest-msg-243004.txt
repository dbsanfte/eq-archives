There's a vendor in PoK who sells unlimited fishing grubs. It was very
cheap to make it to 122. And then I went to payala fruit + water flask
until 180-something. Then minotaur hero's brew. Until about 192 (pre-
new-interface) and gave up in disgust. ***9*** items!!! ICK!!!.
Finally hit 200 the first day of the new interface. :)
