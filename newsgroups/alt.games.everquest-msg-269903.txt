One for each class combination which offers a distinct game experience.

There are twenty four unique classes in EQ2.  As is, you only get to
experience four of them, unless you wish to constantly delete and recreate
your characters, in most cases never reaching the levels where they become
thier own unique class.

If they want to divide it so that no more than 4 are on each server that's one
thing.   But only four across all servers is insane.
