It's

you could also get some snare charged webs in CC.   time consuming, but you
can do this.  once you get the webs, you can snare things yourself for
solo-ing.  Sow potions work great also.  charming is probably the best way
to go when solo-ing, as you can use another critter to fight for you, get
exp for it, and not expend all your mana and HP and have to run without
killing it.

Root blasting does work some, but when its blue to you it tends to not get
rooted long enough.

You also have the very real possibility of death.  If you go LD while in a
fight, you can pretty much assume your dead when you get back.  Paying for
rezzes and the down - time and loss makes groups much more feasible.
