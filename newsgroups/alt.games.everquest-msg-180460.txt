Once I can?  Are you implying that any random black guy is more than a match
for me?  That all black guys are capable of a higher level of athletic
prowess and therefore will beat me in a one-on-one?  Or perhaps that any
random black guy will have a "posse" to call on to take care of me?

Be careful when accusing someone of racism that your own prejudices not come
to light.
