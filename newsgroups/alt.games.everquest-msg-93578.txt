I don't mind "k" because I hear people SAY "k."  What also gets under my
last nerve is "kk."  What's that supposed to mean?

And "PST" meaning "Please Send Tell" is now extremely popular on Zeb (a new
thing).  How much of a dumbass do you have to assume all other players are
if you feel that you have to give such an obvious instruction.

Actually, it proves the "PST" sayer is a BIGGER dumbass.  After all, it's
easier to realize that the appropriate response to "/auc Selling Yak, 50p"
is, of course, to send them a tell (sorry, this sentence is horrible
grammar) than it is to realize what "PST" means.
