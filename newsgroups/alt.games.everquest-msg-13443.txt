Fine. I'll add this, sense or no sense.

So, as long as you can't attack it... say pulling into a protected spot to
heal yourself up, it's not an exploit? If nothing else I think we should be
able to find a log of past punishable exploits Verant has discovered and/or
acted on. That's fair, right?

We're all just a bit off on the definition of an exploit I think. If Verant
could clear it up with some kind of examples...

Sir/Madame, I thank you for nipping my babbling in the bud.
