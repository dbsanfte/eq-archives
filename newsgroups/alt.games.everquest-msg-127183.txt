I didn't think ( although I could very easily be misinformed) that GOI
and GOB had any mana regen components to them.  No idea what
theft of though or wandering mind are... chanter mana steals?  I didn't
mention chanter mana steals although I did list the necro one, a clear
oversight.  Is the Druid mana regen self only wolf form "form of the howler"
or what?  And does anyone know the mana regen numbers on any of
those?

Going to go check this "Graffes" of which you speak.
