Red herring.  What we were discussing was AD&D allowing you to get
experience for killing any mob, no matter how low.  I don't care if in
the hypothetical example you make it the same dungeon or a different
one every night, the point is still the same.  The DM would not allow
the group to kill one kobold night after night.

Quests are supposed to be different.  VI has some vague notion that
they should involve something other than just killing uber mobs, so
they put what they can in to make them seem like real quests.  Since
there isn't much to the game BESIDES killing stuff, granted, quests
can seem a bit weak in places.

And I'm glad you find it so easy to kill any mob in the game that the
only investment you put in is time.  Wish it were that easy for me.

Relevant why?  You're not going to suggest there's a cause and effect
here, are you?

Relevant why?  You are still restricted from going to places.  You've
had it EASY in EQ, at least insofar as level restrictions goes.

OK, this is the kernel, right here.  Believe me, I understand your
point and I have some sympathy with it.  In Asheron's Call, the
majority of loot is generated randomly, there are very few static
pieces on specific mobs.  VI has taken a different approach, rightly
or wrongly.  And sometimes, you're absolutely right, a piece of loot
is given to a mob way too low for the value of the piece.  VI drools
at the mouth occasionally -- no question.

I still can't help feeling that yours is the argument of the high
school senior who says, "By God, if I want to play in the sandbox, I
will, I've earned it, and the hell with whether it's meant for the
kindergartners."

I simply and honestly don't understand why you all are so upset, I
find that attitude mystifying.

No, I haven't personally been there, but I have several friends who
have.  Just tonight someone was raving to me about all the great loot
he'd gotten in Velketor's and I have another friend who recently
purchased about 15k worth of cobalt with the proceeds of what he'd
gotten from Seb.  And you're on about the 800 pp for gator legs?

Great.  Sounds swell.  I do that too.  Low and mid levels can't do
that though, can they?

Um, just remind me why you should be able to do that and they
shouldn't?

One of our fundamental disagreements here appears to be about whether
"paying your dues" should mean you're admitted to some kind of good
ol' boy network or not.

I daresay I've been playing as long as you have.  I have many, many
characters, at various stages of advancement.  I don't think any of my
characters should have "rights" that the others don't have.

Good point.  The difference in that case is frequency.  It's funny, I
see the uber-twinked level 1 or level 5 all the time.  The
uber-twinked 35?  Can't remember the last one I saw.  Level 50 in a
level 30 zone?  Constantly.

Totally, totally disagree.  I find soloing a crashing bore.  I think
the game only shines in a group.
