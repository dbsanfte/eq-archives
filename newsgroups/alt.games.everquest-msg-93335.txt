The gemsetter is trivial for the Tinkerer to make at 215 skill, which is I
think your confusion.  Also to hopefully clarify, the gemsetter will raise
your effective skill  in JC by 5%, bound at 255.  So with 200 JC, you would
have the same chance to combine as someone with 210 JC and no gemsetter. It
does not affect trivial boundaries, meaning if an item was trivial at 205,
and you had 200 JC + the gemsetter it would still have a chance to raise
your skill (even though your effective skill is 210).

One final thing is it will not raise your skill past 255.  So if you had 243
skill with the gemsetter, that computes to 243 + (243 * 0.05 = 12.15) =
255.15, but would cap at 255.  So after 243, with the gemsetter, you will
still gain in skill level, but your success rate will not improve.
