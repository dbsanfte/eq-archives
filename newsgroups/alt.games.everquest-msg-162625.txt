A.  any kind of invis (including invis to animals) kills
a mage pet.  (that's why we like Earthen Boots - insta
cast invis to animals is a quick way to dispose of a pet
when he runs off).

B.  pet casters used to be able to invis with a pet up
(first couple of months of release).  It was removed because
folks were exploiting it.  The same reason a necro can
only FD for a short time with pet up without it poofing.

C.  as a result of B, folks who could cast invis were griefing
by doing drive by invises of pet classes - forcing their
pets to poof in the middle of a fight - so the made invis
group only.
