that's the thing... for whatever reason, I really really really have
trouble doing the "/shout could any1 help me get my corpse" thing.
Don't know what it is, because in RL I don't mind asking for
directions.

I think the "it did take a fair chunk of effort/time to get it out of
some zones" sums out why I didn't explore as much as I wanted to.

I was a member of a really good, medium sized guild (by good I mean
friendly) and you're right, if I was willing to ask, it wouldn't have
been too bad for most zones.  I hate bugging people to do stuff for
me.  And no, that didn't mean I was unwilling to help out others, I
was happy to do that when I could... just hate bugging people.

But here's one example where it was a pain... guild raid on some
dungeon or other (don't recall which, didn't raid much).  Getting
close to my bedtime, getting ready to log.  Server crashes and stays
down.  So now my bod is deep down.  Can't stay up till the guild
reconvenes and gets it out, that may be hours.  Go to bed thoroughly
pissed off.  Ended up not being as much a hassle as I thought (my wife
stayed up and got me out, so no hassle at all for me) but had that not
happened, I would have been stuck till next time guild raided there...
which might have been long time.

And yes, I'm sure that if I bothered enough people, I could find
someone going in and tag along and do a CR.  See above.
