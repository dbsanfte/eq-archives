The most rabid right wing party in Europe is left wing by most
standards. At least they're left-wing by American standards. Heh. I
kinda like Berlusconni and his people... at least they're starting to
chafe under the EU a bit... Hope that monstrosity is dissassembled
pretty soon...

Fortunately? Really? Oh my God! How do you expect a person to be
self-sufficient and self-reliant if they can't even protect themselves
and their loved ones???

And if the people of Germany had resisted gun confiscation properly,
Hitler would have been a tiny little sidenote in the history books.

Umm... American Revolution?
French Revolution?
Russian Revolution?

Yeah, and you STILL don't have a clue there Davey.
