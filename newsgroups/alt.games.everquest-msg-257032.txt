I used the keyboard for several months at one point, it was better in 
many ways.. but I like the mouse better, keep keyboard for chatting and 
movement.  Which probably just gave the mouselook people heart attacks.

The hotkeys for the things I do a lot are all clustered in tight, and 
its a very small move to get over the right one and click.

Intimidate works or fails to work some time before it pops back up, and 
there's a message either way... although at the moment I have the kick 
missing or the fear resisted messages going to a different window than 
the feared or didn't scare messages, which is annoying.

I'm self employed, I can play EQ 24/7 if I like... but I don't cause I 
also like to eat... so I have to go make swords, playing EQ doesn't pay 
the bills.

But no, not 16 hours a day really, thread title is a song quote.
