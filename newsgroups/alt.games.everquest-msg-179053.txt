I went to Qeynos to do the badge quests, but after handing in the helm for
the first one and going to the tree outside the Lion's (something) pub,
where the investigator is supposed to be, there was no sign of him.
I waited for about 30 mins, still no sign.
Is he on a timer? I would have thought that he would be triggered by the
helm hand-in.

Any suggestions?
