Dont just nuke Drianna every chance you get, just to get revenge. She 
give bad faction with the Currupt Guards in Qeynos. That might not seem 
like a lot, but i got a guards thats level 50 or so nuke the shit outta 
me when i was trying to MQ the headband quest for my monk.

Several guards in Qeynos are NASTY to get KOS to. but most of the 
corrupt guards are only scowling, but NOT ready to attack. So if you 
kill her a lot, be prepared to have problems in Qeynos. I have to be in 
wolf form to get in there, and im dubious when doing that.
