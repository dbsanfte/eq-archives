That's seems to be a pointless way to validate decision you've already
made.  If the EverQuest II forums were still up you'd've been able to
see crap spouted up about World of Warcraft.   If you read the City of
Heroes forums you would've seen crap spouted about both games.  And if
you checked the forums a few hours later when the moderators were awake,
you wouldn't have seen anything.
