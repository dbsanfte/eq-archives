I finally had a Dark elf go in and buy it for me. Was getting killed all the
time because invisiblity wore off at wrong times.

I tryed to do it yesterday afternoon after the patch and the guard was right
in the water and the fish was swimming pass him all the time. Maybe his was
just out of place and will return back to where he should be. Alot of the
npcs seem to be out of place lately.
