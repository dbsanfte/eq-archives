Im sorry James, but I call bullshit.

RZtW was constantly repopping after death (when he shouldnt have been)..
there was no way you could of killed every pop to protect your elemental
planes...  so to look like the nice guys, you offer them a "deal"..

The deal was bs.. you had no control over the mob like you previously did

Maybe you are the only guild in all of EQ who genuinally would have offered
the same deal had you been able to "protect" his spawn, but every other
guild I've seen wouldn't/didnt.. so I kinda doubt it

See above....  but was that deal to honestly help them James, or because you
guys realised you had NO chance to block RZtW attempts..

Like you guys arent?   Loot is what motivates every guild
Of course PA is another level.. but its quite obvious now, SOE isnt bothered
about cracking down on it

The posts I saw from your guildies mentioned no such agreement or deal.. it
was flames to mock their zerg tactics and lack of skill
