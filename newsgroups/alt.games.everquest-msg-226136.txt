Shout on test is reserved really for raiding.. and even then, most
people use a channel.

Aye, no one test likes it, they are even taking grouchyness if people
arrive buff to 25 and ask where to fight for xp, if they dont know
then they are frowned at it seems

People in the bazaar arent common on test, generally if it goes over
30 its impressive. On test its more a what goes around comes around,
if you give to people, people will give back kind of environment.

People are 65 on test, and some are in PoTime too on test, people just
seem to not like to believe they worked for it.

No, get to 25 anyway you like, but, dont expect to get a guild if you
arrive and buff. If you work up and people see you and meet you you
may get one, if not you may have to wait till 35+

It is tempting, its just advisable to research your class, read your
spell book, and use your eq eyes and ears, not just sit on your butt
and whine :) Hell, most people on test probably have testbuffed even
if it was just for a laugh.. 

It is possible as a buffee to make it on test, especially if you kinda
watch your environment and go with it, rather than try and take what
you did somewhere else and do it on test.  Ive made great friends
there, I started as a buffee, and well, 65 now and people seem to
think Im ok :) I get plenty of group requests :)

There are some buff guilds eg, people who buffed and will accept you
buffee nice guy, or buffee moron.. The only worry Id have with that if
a guild is that important to you would be that if your guild is 50 /
50 moron / nice guy... you may get tarred with the moron factor..

However, I think half the thing is, each server *is* different in
atttiude, and whatever the attitude on the server is, watch it, adapt
to it, and you should do fine.

My FV character is 5 has a bp, a weapon and nothing else.. I was in a
guild but iddnt play there for ages and rightly so they dropped me out
the guild - or the guild died.. Havent seen any of the toons on.
