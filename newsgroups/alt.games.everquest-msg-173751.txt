Eh, for general running around, SoE is vastly superior to SoW.  Longer
duration, levitate, and see inviso are all handy especially if you're
traveling through unfriendly territory.

But if I'm going to be in one zone hunting, wolfie is just a lot more
convenient.  Duration is the big thing, but the mana regen isn't
anything to sneeze at either.

And you're right, wolfie overwrites SoE.

At 60 druids get Form of the Hunter, which is just a slightly faster
wolfform with no mana regen and a decent ATK buff.  But since I melee
just about never, I'm not really all hot to get that one.  (Just got
60 day before yesterday.)

There's also Mask of the Hunter and Mask of the Stalker.  Both do the
same things, (increase size, vision magnification, 3 mana per tick,
and ultravision) but Hunter is outdoor and Stalker is indoor.  They
have a nice long duration, and stack with SoE.  And if I can get the
20k plat that it will probably cost me for them, I'll be all over them
like a fat man on a buffet.  The vision magnification thing might be
annoying, but we'll see.

Anywho, for now I'll stick with wolfie.
