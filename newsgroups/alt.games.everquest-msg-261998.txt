You could -try- putting your billing info in place of your friend's on
that account, then either making an additional account and seeing if
you can transfer characters off that account to the new one or to your
old one (with the pally). Worse thing that will happen (that I can
see) is Sony says no. I'm thinking its highly unlikely since an active
account is a paying account. But then again I don't work at Sony, I
have a thing against screwing paying\loyal customers over. >:)
