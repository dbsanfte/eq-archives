EQ plays the same at level 1 as it does at level 60. Kill/loot and
grind exp. The only things that change are Raids, skill sets,
items/money, and the relative power of PCs vs NPCs. A 53 monk killing
Bats/Bugs in SolB, is not much different than a level 3 monk doing the
same in the Qeynos Newbie area. It is just a matter of scale.

Some people love to play EQ at lower levels, some at mid levels, and
some at high levels. What makes EQ so special is the fact that all
three groups can play the way they want on the same servers. :-)
