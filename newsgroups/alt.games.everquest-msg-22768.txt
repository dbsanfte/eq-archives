Actually I find it a PITA. Finding the quirks on pathing normally cause me
few deaths until I build up experience on each new zone I hunt in. I do hunt
very differently in zones with known bad pathing too. A heck of a lot of
root/snare and an extra dose of caution. My pet using alts just stay the
heck out of dodge.

Heh - I wasn't expecting any. I was just pointing out that pathing issues
cut both ways.

In Kerra Isle I just think:
 "Typical - pretending to "just happen to be wandering this way"- no special
trip for me at all of course.....cats!"
Whilst in the Warrens it's:
 "Typical - they can't even tear my head off without stopping and sniffing
each others butt's on the way....oops, where did he disappear
to...Eww!..Maybe I don't want to fight these dogs after all..."

I used the discalimer in that instance because I have definate views on this
topic, but in that particular post I was pulling my head in for once...
