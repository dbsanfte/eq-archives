Of course. Hey, I subscribe to Fortean Times, so you aren't going to get 
more open-minded than me. Of course the scientific establishment has a track 
record of burying uncomfortable data, there is no denying that, but then 
again, it's even more stupid to deny that science, close-minded as it is 
sometimes, just *works*. Your own examples of nuclear fission and powered 
flight weren't exactly the work of mavericks working against the 
establishment (although the Wright brothers did develop much of their 
theoretical foundation in aerodynamics on their own), but of people working 
on scientific foundations that, in the case of Mathematics, go back 
literally *thousands* of years. 

You know, challenging received wisdom is all very well, and as a matter of 
fact, it *is* the way science works. New theories replace old theories all 
the time, but there is a condition: they have to be backed by evidence. And 
while I'll be the first to admit that scientists are famous for being 
selectively blind (and you only have to look at the debate on animal 
consciousness to see this), on the whole good theories drive out bad 
theories every time, even if it takes long.

Okey, I'll bite. Would you care to explain to us the evidence on which you 
find that Earth is not as old as "some" (by this I take you mean the 
consensus of geologists, astronomers, physicists, chemists and biologists 
that place the age of the Earth at around five billion years) put it, and 
instead is a "bit" older than 10.000 years? And don't mention carbon dating, 
please. Carbon 14 dating only works for organic matter, and it has a useful 
range of a few thousand years. You wouldn't use it to date rocks.
