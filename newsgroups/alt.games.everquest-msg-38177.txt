Binding is no a problem the entrance to Stonebrunt is through the Warrens
and you can be bound right outside Warrens. You are able to bind in the
entire zone of Paineel. with a little work in Stonebrunt or warrens you will
be able to deal with the merchants in Paineel took my Ikasar Shaman 2 days
to be able to bank and on the third I was able to buy and sell.
Loot is rather weak in my opinion but exp is great.
