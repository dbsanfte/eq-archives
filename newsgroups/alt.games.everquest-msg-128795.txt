Human rights????  I'm sorry, but they're whining that the Isrealis don't
play nice, and don't put up with BS.  Sorry, you screw with someone's
homeland, that's what you get.

1)  Amnesty International is -far- from neutral on this issue.  They are an
activist orginization, not a news agency.

2)  CNN is sympathetic to palestine.

Please, list the crimes.  I could list the various acts of terrorism that
palestine has committed against the Jews.  I could list the various charges
against Hitler and is brood.... I have yet to see like charges against
Isreal (or at least ones that stand the smallest bit of scrutiny).  If you
have a point, GET TO IT.

> "self-genocide"... that's the most stupid reasoning i've ever heard.

Just out of curiosity, what do you think were to happen if palestine were to
stop killing Isrealis?
