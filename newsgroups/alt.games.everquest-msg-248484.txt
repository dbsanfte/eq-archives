Note that Ubisoft customers can't buy new expansions as downloads from SOE,
so you have to wait until you can buy the box every time a new one is
released.

Ubi customers are those who buy the New Dawn box or transfer characters to
a Ubisoft server (Venril Sathir, Sebilis (French), Kael Drakkal (German)).
