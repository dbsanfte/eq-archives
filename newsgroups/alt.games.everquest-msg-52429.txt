OK - I'm stumped. (checks around) dual wield at 18, double attack at 20,
and the spell line up at 22 is nothing to be thrilled about except for
maybe Harmony. What's so special about a Ranger hitting 22? Not played
one past 6 myself so I have no idea why 22 would be such a defining moment
for a Ranger?
