Where does this come from?

New user to EQ, was dubbing around Rivervale scrounging up gold and leather
armor for my new halfling paladin when up comes a higher level user. After
asking if I am shopping for weapons, she tells me she has a few I might
like. I tell her honestly, cant afford anything you probably have, but
thanks. Then she just gives this to me for free.

Think it is 12/36 magic lore item

Is this a popular thing, for higher level characters to just randomly hand
out stuff? Very cool thing if you ask me.
