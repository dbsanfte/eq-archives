Duoed with a 70 ranger and 70 BL and it wasn't really tough, just long.
 Neither of us raids.  Honestly the only way I can think that you would
fail is that you had a metric buttload of adds (they are even more gimp
than normal fear trash)...not the ones he spawns but rather the regular
old Fear adds.  Of course it helps if you can heal yourself but still,
he really isn't that tough, just annoying.

When clearing Fear, either kill off all of the scarelings _last_ (per
pull) or have one person kite them well away from the group and kill
them single.  One scareling in the zone will spawn a non-KOS, but
social-with-everything version of the Ireblind called "An Enraged Imp"
(I think?).  Killing him spawns the Ireblind, which is KOS.  So you can
avoid fighting him 'til you want to by spawning his second "version"
alone.  (Or feign off/zone off agro)  Now get away and dont agro
anything around him and clear some more trash if you like, to prevent
more adds while fighting him.  If you are bringing a group to fear, you
may well want to kill the golems anyway and will probably want to clear
the adds.

The last time I killed him I think we killed off his adds first, or
maybe started killing them but said screw it and just went for him.
That is probably optional.  They lose agro when you are mezzed and dont
even necessarily regain it because they are green and wander out of
agro range.  Otherwise, just keep DPS on him and the cleric uses fast
heals when unmezzed.  Everyone should be prepared to use some healing
potions to take up the slack but then everyone should be able to handle
getting hit by some Fear trash.

Dotting yourself and others is an option but unfortunately it is tough
to land dots on players with modern (even bazaar) gear giving them 200
and 300+ resists, and then you run in to problems if you land the dot
on your weakest-geared toon but your best-geared remains mezzed, so you
can probably only use such a strategy on one or two people, if any.
