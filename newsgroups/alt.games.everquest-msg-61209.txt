Hello, McFly. The mana regen and hitpoint regen rate in EQ is a
constant. You gain mana and hitpoints every level. The Mobs increase
in hitpoints faster then you do. If you kill a green mob at level 10
with 50% mana usage and one at level 40 with 50% mana usage the static
regen rate guarantees that the downtime at level 40 will be
significantly greater.  It's not magic it's simple math.
