While PoP and LoY may not technically require something better, his
computer will likely grind to a halt in those zones, as they are far
more demanding than pre-Luclin. Installing them is fine, though, as
long as he doesn't go there. He could install Luclin, too, as long as
he doesn't try to use the new models or actually go to Luclin it
should have no negative impact.

You can play on any machine with EQ installed, problems only occur
when you try to go somewhere your account is registered for that isn't
actually installed.
