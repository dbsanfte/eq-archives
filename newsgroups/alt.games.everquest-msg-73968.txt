If you want a blue server (non-KOS) they're all pretty much the same except
Ant Bayle...that one is in Europe.

But don't worry about it...crowding is NOT an issue anymore.  Nowhere NEAR
an issue anymore.  Hell, Kunark took care of 90% of the crowding issues, and
what little it didn't handle, Velious did.  Luclin is just adding yet more
zones.

Finding a group is just as much an issue now as before, except THEN it was
that you had lots of competition from others groupless in the zone.  NOW
it's hard to find more than a few people per zone average. :p

Soloing you pretty much have all of the Old World to yourself.  Stay out of
the lemming zones unless you're looking for a group  (EC, Oasis, Lake of Ill
Omen, Over There, South Karanas, maybe Highpass).
