MOR is just like a DS, there is no credit to anyone for the damage it does.
Thus, if a mob aggros on your buddy, you MOR it, but he turns out to be afk and
never does any damage, when it kills itself no-one will get the experience (even
if the mob is cyan+ to you, you won't get exp either).  But if anyone does even
one point before the MOR kills the mob, then that person will get full exp.

At low levels, this is far from an efficient approach to PLing, the cost of MOR
compared to the life span of the mob its on is prohibative.  The reason a DS
class can PL well is that the DS goes on the PL recipient, so its always going
to last full duration.  It also works while many mobs are chewing on the victim
at one time, as long as he manages to switch targets to each of them and do at
least a point before they die.

My recent discovery in the "ultimate low level PL buff" is the level 50 ranger
spell Call of Earth.  This is an attack buff but also includes a 4 point DS.
Unlike most DS spells, though, it lasts an hour (longer with appropriate
disciplines and focus items).  From level one, if you can avoid death, this can
mean -many- levels on one cast.  Even up to 20 it was still significantly
increasing my kill rate; the longer the mobs live the more damage they do to
themselves hitting that little DS.  Its around that level though that an
approach using MOR starts to be effective, where a 15 point DS on a =red to the
PL-ee= lasts long enough to be worthwhile.

Part of the reason MOR isn't effective before this point is that there is a
maximum amount of exp you can get per mob.  Sure, MOR on a level 15 mob would be
useful for giving a level 5 character a kill, because the mob will take long
enough to die, but your buddy won't get any more exp than he would "killing" a
level 10 mob.

For a cleric, probably the ultimate PLing tool is Donal's Vambraces.  Chain
click these on your (no conflicting HP buffed) PL victim, and he's getting a 220
hp heal every 10 seconds, at no mana cost to you.  Mana is the main thing
keeping a cleric from being a really effective PLer, small heals are inefficient
and your victim probably doesn't have the HP for really large ones even with
your best buffs on him; I always found myself gradually losing the mana battle
when PLing.  Using Donal's Arms, though, this factor largely vanishes; at the
cost of a couple hundred HP of buffs your victim gets 1400 hp a minute regen!
If he's got COE, you really need do nothing more than hang out keeping him in
full HP while he aggros every mob he can find (hopefully doing a bit of damage
on the pull) and just porcupines them all to death.  This approach works for any
class and helps max out their defense, offense, and weapons skills too, as they
get beat on and beat back in return.

I've said this numerous times; the people who think of Paladul as only the
bandit camps are really missing out.  A great ZEM is a great ZEM, any  time you
can find an exp mob there to kill.  And the mobs in PC are fairly easy to kill,
too; if a level 5 mob there fought like a level 7 mob elsewhere then the math
wouldn't work out so well; fact is, that level 5 mob is probably no more
difficult than some level 4 mobs in other zones (I remember some fire beetles
with very high social aggro radius in Qeynos, or Spiderlings in... gfay was it?
with a very high regen rate... tough for their level).  As you work further in
the bugs start acting more social, then there are the Phlargs which have that
nasty crud and so forth... but the ZEM still makes the exp per mob some of the
best you'll ever see, if you can handle the harder fights.
