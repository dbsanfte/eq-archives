Pity you didn't go on to ask why the Monk wasn't using FD to
shake agro.  I'd say the incompetence of the Monk was a whole
lot worse than the poverty of the Warrior.

Seen the same thing, except it was a 53 Warrior taking agro from a
59 Warrior because he was dual-wielding some sort of high agro
weapons.  Best part was that the 53 twink hadn't the sense to carry
a 2-hander to avoid problems like that.  The 59 Warrior had no
trouble at all holding agro vs. my then 53 Paladin using a SotM,
which is an irritatingly high taunt weapon, except on the caster
mobs that I was stunning early and often (and it didn't much matter
who had agro from them, they didn't get to swing very often).

That's just... disgusting.
