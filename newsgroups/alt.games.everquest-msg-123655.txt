That's all well & good but I have to ask a question since I'm neither a
lawyer or politician.

You make it sound like it's a law somewhere.  If so, when and where was it
signed into law?  While glancing at the document I saw no official
US-sounding bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo that even hinted it was.  If I missed
it could you c&p it here?

I'm thinking that unless it's a law somewhere, it's a totally useless
document to this conversation.
