My character can cast sow, so whilst wondering around the world bumped
into a bard who was helping me whilst lost. On went the autofollow and
they cast on me, dont know what as was not paying attention.

Next thing I am moving at twice the speed of sow. Then I see the
horses and drogs, so can anyone provide me with any information as too
the level of speed of each in order if possible?
