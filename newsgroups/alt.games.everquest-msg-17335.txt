For all of you who arelready preparing to shower and make a rare
appearance at work tomorrow because of patch day, don't take off those
fuzzy slippers and bathrobe yet.  The tuesday patch has now been pushed
back to Wed. Same time span as normal estimated. No reason given. No
pre-patch message posted yet that I saw.
