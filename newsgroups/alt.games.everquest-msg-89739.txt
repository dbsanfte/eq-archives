Hi,

according to www.eqatlas.com info there should be alchemy supplies salesmen
in Shadowhaven (nearby library) and in Paineel (building next to bank). I
searched and couldn't find anything in Shadowhaven and only a few herbs,
none of which I could use for making SoW potions, in Paineel.

I checked the shops in Shadowhaven with my enchanter, since my shaman is an
iksar and not all sell to her yet. Doing quests for faction, but it seems
the casters in the library building are not tied to the quests I do (Gaero
in bazaar fedex and gather reports from guy in DP for mistala; most are
amiable now, started at dubious).

Who can help me find a place to buy the herbs? Now I have to port to Velious
and prices are quite high in Thurgadin.
I am bound in Nexus and only cities I can visit so far are Cabilis
(ofcourse), Paineel, Erudin partly, Shadowhaven.

Natasja
