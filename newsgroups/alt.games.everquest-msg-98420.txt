Err, you do know that you get a message indicating when the root wears off,
right? No need to actually look at the mob to tell. Now, targeting it for
another root may be another matter, but if you are concentrating so heavily
on when a root wears off, odds are you are soloing and keep targeting on
the mob nonstop.
