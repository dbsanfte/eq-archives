Well, the "Hot sauce" you are talking about is not intended to be 
consumed in the concentrations you are talking about.  I don't believe it 
will cause permanent damage, but, I'd sure want to find out first prior 
to trying it.  http://www.fiery-foods.com/dave/capsaicin.asp is a link 
with some information.  Sounds like the lethal dose is likely quite a bit 
higher than you can get into a meatball, but, it is not actually known 
for humans.  Regardless, the side effects from consumption of that kind 
of quantity can be fairly nasty.  Not that I would have any compassion 
for said food thief, but, you do want to know what you are getting into 
here.
