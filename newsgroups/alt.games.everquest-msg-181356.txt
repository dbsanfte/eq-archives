Hi Graham,

Recently one of my guild has had a similair problem with a message that 
came from www.messagestomper.com. If you resolve the address via an 
nslookup it returns the IP address of 64.246.38.10. If you then try to 
resolve the returned IP address it resolves as freak1.freakmachines.net. If 
you then try to resolve that name it returns nothing because it is bogus.

If you have Messenger on whilst in game please shut it down because the 
spammers are exploiting holes in the code to send you advertisements. Get 
yourself a good firewall and switch messenger off whilst in game.

Moodel.
