  I don't think they've improved the mana regeneration rate while
meditating, but they have made a few additions and improvements that may
make meditating slightly more palatable (spelling?).

  With the addition of Luclin, they added Meditation skill+% items.  So if
you equp a med+2% item, and you have 200 meditation skill, you meditate as
if you have 204 meditation skill.

  Also, with the addition of AAXP skills, there is the "Mental Clarity"
ability which can improve your mana regeneration by up to 3 points per tick
(and this stacks with the Clarity line and mana regen songs)... all of the
casting classes can learn this skill.  Also, hybrids can further improve
their mana regeneration with their class-specific "Mind and Body
Rejuvenation" skill which improves health/mana regen by up to another
another 3 points per tick.

  Enchanters have a "Gather Mana" AAXP skill that they can use to regain all
of their mana, but it can only be used once every 2 1/2 hours or so.

  AAXP skills and new spells have been added to reduce chances of fizzles,
enable spell crits, and to improve the odds of a specialization skill
activation, all of which act together to make it so your spells are
occassionally more mana efficient.

  Another improvement made to meditation is that now anybody with the
meditation skill can sit down to meditate, not just level 35+ characters,
but if it was taking you 10-15 minutes to regain all your mana, I'm sure
your character was above level 35.

  So once you pick up a few of these skills, spells and/or items, you may
find your med times reduced a bit (or that you don't have to meditate quite
as much), but I would still expect to have to wait a pretty long time to go
from low mana to full mana.
