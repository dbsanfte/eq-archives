Hi all.

I havent been playing the game much recently, so I have dropped behind 
most of my guildies, who are now no longer doing Kael raids.
On a recent HoT raid I won a pair of SS legs for my paladin.
My faction to CoV was dubious before, and through wholesale slaughter of 
the giants in GD I am now at indiff. :(
Are there any Skyshrine quests worth doing for faction, that only 
require indifferent faction, as I am sick of killing giants for no xp.
