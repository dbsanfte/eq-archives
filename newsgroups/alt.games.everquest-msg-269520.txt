Yeah, EQ2 tradeskilling is nice. I maxed fletching in EQ1, doing it
from the days when it was hard as hell (1 arrow per combine ;) ),
and it was never fun beyond giving more 'depth' to my ranger
character. The EQ2 system is much more engaging - it remains to
be seen if it remains so though... the forge at level 2 will still
be the forge at level 20, wheras new dungeons and monsters are
new content. 

Nontheless, I'm finding it very satisfying having a bank full of
boxes *I* made with *my* name on them, using a rapier I made, 
jewellery I made, etc. Its still very low level stuff, but its
kind of fun to be self sufficient like that, and developing
another side of the character. In fact, some of the stuff I've
made is junk.. .but I look in my bank at my 'crude elm strongbox'
with barely more slots than a store bought bag, and its next
to the better and better boxes as I got better. Eventually I'll
sell it, and thats ok, but its more stuff to do.

I like the variety , I guess - combat, quests, tradeskilling. I
even made my own spells as I levelled up, and so far the search
for components hasnt been a tedious mindless grind in the way it
might be in EQ1. Instead of needing 'arbitrary random rune 32
rare drop from zone Xyz' I need many many components... but I can
make these components from the raw materials, if I want to, or
buy them from a more junior tradesperson.

Example:

Rune requires;
lead ornament
lead spike
etc

lead ornament requires
refined lead bar
coal
temper

refined lead bar requires
raw lead
coal
fossil temper

fossil temper requires
chloro wash
liquid
candle

chloro wash requires
roots
liquid
candle

and so on... so I can work all the way from 'I mined my lead,
gathered some roots and bought some water, coal and candles',
or I can just go buy the lower components required, or I can
buy the end product.

Making the item is like combat, sort of... as you make the item
its 'hit points' (progress bar) changes dependant on your 
success but your 'hit points' (its durability) decreases. The
trick is to complete the progress bar before all the durability
runs out. Durability is divided into 4 phases, and if you 
complete before the 1st has been consumed you make a pristine
item, if you only manage it in the last its crude, with impact
on number returned, quality of end result, etc.

There are various spells (tradeskills) you can use during the
combat to trade off various aspects of the item to boost
progress (its durability, your mana, or your success chance),
and sometimes you will have to use these to respond to special
attacks (events) from the item, such as using 'cutting' to
respond to an unexpected knot in a piece of wood.

Should you ignore those events, as well as damaging the item they
can damage you - you could conceivably be killed by a writing
desk accident while scribing a new spell :)
