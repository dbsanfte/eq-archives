I have always found farming equipment the most efficent way to make
money.  The quickest I ever farmed money was kiting the named in Riwwi
back when they didn't summon and the loot was a little more valuable.
I have heard that some of them still don't summon but I have no idea
which ones.

Solo, at least for most people, I would expect that the old and the
rare are the best choices.  Fungus Covered Tunic popped in to my mind
first.  Maybe CT Sewers as well.  (Both already mentioned).  Last time
I tried Rathe was as a 65 Ranger (pre OoW).  I ripped through them
pretty damn quick (you can shoot arrows in melee range, which is nice
when you don't have those 96/9 PoTime/Anguish 1-hand-slashers.  I still
made about 1k an hour.  I doubt that I would ever average more than 2k,
even now, especially if you include the time it takes to gate/run back,
sell and bank, then return once your bags are full and you can barely
move because you are encumbered.

Most 70's should be able to solo some of the more gimp named in OoW
zones.  Some of that stuff sells for at least a few K.  Someone
mentioned Acrylia Caverns.  At the Herbalist (long time ago) I used to
get a mythril BP or GS Mask at least once an hour and sell for 7-10k,
though I dont know what those would sell for these days.

I don't know that anyone can make as much money solo, though, as a good
farming group can.  Once again, already mentioned, but RCOD kicks a lot
of ass for that since it isn't nearly as camped (thus the sellable
equipment not nearly as common) as zones like WoS.  DoN Creator
crystals, 40 a pop, and a good puller = 30 minute mission time or less.
 Plus there is the vendor loot and stuff like the Metallic Drake Scales
to consider.
