Hey all.
Anybody have the problem of the windows mouse getting "stuck" or "captured"
in the game when you first start?

mine does this... if I cycle through the resolution modes, it goes away, but
it's there at first and doesn't go away unless I cycle through.

Has anybody else had this problem, did you take care of it, and if so, how?

oh.  I'm running Win2k Pro.
thanks.

~Nikki
