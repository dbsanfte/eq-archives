Here's a second thing to try, though I'm not sure if this particular bug
will apply here. For a while, the Loremaster quest NPC in Thurgadin who
does the first few shawl quests would not respond to a hail... *if* you
had him targeted normally. However, during that period, it was
discovered that if you targeted yourself (or nothing) and hailed, then
he would respond.  Might be something similar to that bug, so give it a
try.
