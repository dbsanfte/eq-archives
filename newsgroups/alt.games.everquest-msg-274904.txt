Forgive me if I'm missing this, but I see only one post in this subthread by 
Mr. Tutino, and he did nothing of the sort in that post.  His only example 
was a business refusing to allow a black person to patronize its business.

No, they are absolutely not identical.  Where on earth did you get *that* 
idea?  If I run a restaurant the Department of Health can send someone over 
to make sure my kitchen's up to code so my patrons aren't going to get sick 
eating at my establishment.  They can't do something like that in my home 
kitchen.  That's just one example.  There are scores more.  I have no idea 
why you think they're identical.  You don't run a retail business, do you?

I think perhaps you should look a little closer at the relevant law before 
you decide to make an absolutist proclamation as you have here.
