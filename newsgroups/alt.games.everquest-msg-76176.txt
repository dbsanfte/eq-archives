Subject: Armor on Felwithe Soulbinder

Does anyone know what the armor that the female soulbinder in Felwithe wears
is? I thought it was the new texture for Elven Chain, since I also saw a couple
of female High Elves wearing it elsewhere (one was a caster, but I don't
remember what class; other was a Paladin). But I could have sworn that I saw a
Half-Elf wearing a suit of Elven Chain recently that looked much like it did
before the new SoL textures....

Or does it just look completely different on High Elves?

(If anyone hasn't been to Felwithe lately, but has SoL, its the armor on the
blond High Elf on the new loading screen)
