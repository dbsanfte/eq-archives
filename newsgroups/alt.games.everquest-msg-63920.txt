Whilst my fingers are firmly crossed until I get Luclin AND it runs ok, the
answer is partly at least to have a motherboard/CPU configuration that
accepts DDRAM, that way 256meg is the equal of 512 meg SDRAM.

You may not be saying that the others' computers are crap, but it looks that
way to me LOL :)!

On the other hand, who am I to judge? My main problem is the darned fans,
too many of them these days and they're forever going wonky and making
almighty noises. Ah for the days of the silent Spectrum! You knew where you
were then, crap graphics, crap performance, but we thought it rocked!
