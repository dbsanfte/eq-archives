Most of my guild have several characters that they play according to moods
and guild needs. If there's a guild hunt they'll pull up their character
that is most needed by the group.

I myself have only been playing a few months and got attached to my one
character, I started another character but quickly left him by the wayside.
I currently only play one character (a Nec) and enjoy it a lot. I guess if I
get really bored with him (he's lvl 30 now) I'll change to either the mule I
created or the lvl 5 Chanter.

Just do whatever is the most fun for you...
