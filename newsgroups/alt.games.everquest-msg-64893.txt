Is what I am seeing correct?  It says it will take 21 hours to patch.

When I use the old everquest.exe... I patched for 22 minutes and was in... I
could not see the new player models but saw some of the MOB models.

I do not have Luclin.  Would the "patch" be faster with Luclin.  i.e. are
all the new models and such on the disks avoiding this 21 hour download, or
am I stuck with this huge DL?

Can I play with the old everquest.exe without worries and patch when I have
time?

Thanks for any info,

Sunghoi
