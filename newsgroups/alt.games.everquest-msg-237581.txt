Do you have any programs running in the background?  Anti-virus? 
Firewall? Any programs at all?  If so - close them then try again.

You said everything is updated, does that include DirectX? You need to 
be running DirectX 9 now.  It is also not unknown for drivers to become 
corrupted during download, try re-installing directx and all your 
drivers.  It's amazing how many times I *thought* I had everything 
up-to-date but it turned out that either one of my drivers or directx 
was corrupt and needed re-installing.

Hope this helps.
