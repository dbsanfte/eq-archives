You have to use the /usercolor command.  They have a number that corresponds
with different things, such as guild chat, tells, says, etc (I believe
guildchat is number 4).  Then you hafta play around with different color
combos.  Try /usercolor help in game to get a better idea, but for example
you could do /usercolor 4 0 0 255 where the last 3 numbers set the color
combo (red - green - blue I believe).
