Oh, don't feel bad, I think I posted something about Scientology here
once which I meant to post to the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup
and got some puzzled responses (of course, if it had been something to
do with a new EQ race called the Rondroids whose deity is L. Ron
Hubbard, it might have actually been on topic!)

BTW, the vast majority of people who post to alt.religion.scientology
newsgroup are actually CRITICS of Scientology.
