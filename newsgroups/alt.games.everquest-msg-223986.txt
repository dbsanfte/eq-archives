This really sucks.  I have a 49 shaman and am to the CoM part of my epic.  I 
have done the Woe/Envy part twice.  Now I wonder if I should even continue on 
with the rest of the quest.  I fully intended to do the entire quest but did 
the one part twice just to be sure.  If I did want to start over how would I 
get my faction reset?  Do I need to contact a GM to do it?  Or am I screwed?
