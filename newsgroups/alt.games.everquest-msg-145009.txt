French are dumb players. HEY look! That was not impossible at ALL!
You are WRONG!

You might say its invalid, but its certainly possible. If you wanted
to say something more valid you might mention a French player's
liklihood to surrender.

Ahaha stereotypes are funny due to how ridiculous they are. Many
stereotypes are based on fact, though they are still looked upon as
unfair. Its kind of like the stereotype of the "affected" sounding gay
guy who is very effeminate acting in an exaggerated way. I've met a
bunch of gay guys and only known ONE who did not act that way. I was
actually surprised to find out he was gay.
