Nope.  Level dependent.
They won't attack anyone too high level.

They will jump anyone who still cons them blue or even high green.

NOTE:  Any old world mob under level 18 will follow this rule.  If
you're too high, they won't aggro.  But if the mob is over 18, they
will aggro even if they are deep green.
