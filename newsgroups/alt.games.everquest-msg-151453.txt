I was almost bribed an uber guild with 30k to kill Fay for me. Luckily for me,
my guild leader at the time decided to start acting right and stop being an ass
and scheduled the raid....Thats an option if you have the means to do it. Also
might consider going on to your server message board, acertain when VSR will be
up and try to get something going there. Prehaps offering to random off the
second stone might help.
