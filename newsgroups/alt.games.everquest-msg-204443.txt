Yeah, but is that what we (or SOE) want?  A game designed to meet the

desires of the subset of the EQ players who happily abandoned EQ for
DAoC and returned only when their EQ-conditioned expectations weren't
met?  Is that gonna have the same sort of broad-based appeal that EQ
has (braod-based meaning "more popular")?  Hmmm, now that I mention it,
is the popularity of EQ (obviously important to SOE) important to this
tiny sub-group posting here?

Ah hell, I'm not at all sure what I want from EQ2.  All I know is that
I have zero interest in twitch games and little interest in PK games
(that could change, but I haven't tried one I like yet).  Actually, I
think that the best thing they could do would be to create new worlds
for EQ, newly itemized, possibly with "special" rules.  Imagine EQ
without the old-word/mid-world/pop-world problems of today, with few
unrestricted twink items (not none, few).  Imagine EQ where required
level meant not merely required to equip, but required to hold in
inventory (just like the prohibition on multiple LORE items).  Imagine
EQ with a TLC attribute that was specific to individual items (like
NODROP/MAGIC/LORE) and thus could be used to tune specific quests
and/or encounters without impacting anything else.  Imagine EQ where
access to PoK ports was individually level and/or quest restricted:
yes you can earn personal mobility, no the world is not every L1's
oyster.

Maybe the real flaw in EQ2 is that they're changing too damned many
things, throwing out the baby with the bath water as it were.  When
I see how much fun is being had playing on Stromm I really have to
wonder how popular a truly new server, i.e. a server with new content
top to bottom, would be.  I think I'd pay for that content, maybe
not monthly ala Stormhammer, but certainly a one-time fee would be
easy to justify to myself, hell we pay for expansions that amount
to band-aids, I'd rather pay for a whole new world.  If EQ2 was a
"fixed" version of EQ (modern game-engine, Bards "fixed" like you
"fix" your cat, total re-itemization to take twinking down to a more
reasonable level, perhaps even item decay) I'd be certain to try it.
As it is, I don't know if I'll buy it.
