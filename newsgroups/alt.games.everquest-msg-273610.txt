I agree.  This person shouldn't have made everyone miserable earlier
in the first place and now he had to pay the price by not getting
group and guilds.  just like real life, you don't do business with any
jerks.

Booting someone from the guild is an unplesant business.  I very
nearly booted one last month because of complaint he was ninja looting
and being AFK for more than a few minutes (leeching xp).  he has since
then cleaned up his act.
