I have to agree... Group.  There are ways to solo in the game, especially with
certain classes, but EQ is a grouping game.  You'll gain more all around by
grouping than you ever will soloing--especially friends.  The people who learn
to trust you now on Orc Hill may be the ones who are willing to help you with
your epic 45 levels from now.
