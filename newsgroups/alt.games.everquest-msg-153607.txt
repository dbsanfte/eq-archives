Since they recently responded to the EqDruids feeling left out of
end raids with cheal like additions to their spell line, as if they
werent powerful enough, then to nerf these classes why dont they just
go all the way and eliminate all classes except halfing duids. Just
imagine a server filled to the brim quadders, ks'ers, beggars and the
usual LOIO like ooc spam. Ahh....verants vision at work.
