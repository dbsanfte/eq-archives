I think I conned one light blue caster at L53 (forget which flavor).
At L54 the occasional caster and around 1/4 to 1/3 of the "Darkpaw
Gnoll"s are light blue.  Beyond L56 or so it's probably not so great,
but right now there's a steady supply of blue cons.  The biggest
trouble I can see him having is down-time after burning down a caster
(they have necro and cleric type casters, and sometimes you run into
a SoW'd gnoll, so there must be shaman too).  My Paladin does well
against the casters, both solo and partnered/grouped, they can't
cast when they're stunned.  Also, the Necros like to DS themselves
so a dual wielding melee probably should have a 2H with him, and it
might be wise to keep a dispell mem'd.  PR/DR/MR are all usefull.
