Seems to usually be true but depends on the weapons I qould guess. 
The idea *used* to be that two weapons will almost always create more
hate since the act of hitting the mob creates a certain amount of hate
on top of whatever damage you do...so hitting it more often generates
more hate no matter how much damage you did.  I don't know that that
is true though.  Seems to be the generally accepted theory now is that
1 point of (melee) damage = 1 point of hate or something like that.

One reason to use a 2h weapon at any level, by the way, is because it
has some other benefits.  Since you swing less often, mobs will
riposte you less often and you will take less damage.  Since a riposte
by you is one free hit, a 2h'er will also (usually---as long as it is
a higher damage weapon) mean you do more damage with each riposte you
score.  Also, slower weapons mean less damage from damage shields.

Number one: make sure you understand how taunt works.  Taunt does not
create hate in a mob that is already hitting you.  It only gives you
the same hate +1 of whoever it is currently hitting.  Mashing taunt
will not make the mob hate you more but it will ensure that when you
do lose agro, taunt isnt immediately available for you to use to get
agro back.
