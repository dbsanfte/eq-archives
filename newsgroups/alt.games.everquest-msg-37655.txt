Doesn't phase me in the least.  That server count may have come into
consideration when I was first starting out and wanted a less populated
server or needed to find a particular server my friends were on, but since
then, I never even pay attention to the numbers.

My main server is always highlighted and I login to it without paying the
population a second notice.

I'm just a newbie I suppose because I don't see the big deal.  I can however
see why Verant doesn't feel that's anybody's business though.
