You are completely misinterpreting my point, and its only amplified by your
misplaced profanity.  I don't care WHAT kind of a parent she was.  I don't
find ridiculing someone who has lost a child acceptable.

I also don't believe that you can understand the emotional attachment a
parent has for a child unless you have experienced it.  It simply transcends
words, and it deserves a measure of respect that it is not being given.
Unfortunately, that is not something I can prove to you, but you also cannot
prove me wrong.

The entire situation is nothing more than sad to me.  Not funny.  Sad.
