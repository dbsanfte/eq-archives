You've yet to demonstrate anything the disproves "Their world, their
rules". Which, with regard to Blizzard, is the summary of all that
I've said.

You mean you've already run through your entire stock of replies?
Damn, maybe I was wrong and we really have plumbed the depths of your
stupidity.

What experience do you think I'm missing? Again, "Their world, their
rules". That trumps everything in this entire thread.

The point you keep sidestepping is that no matter what you think
you've shown, it doesn't change the very simple fact that your opinion
isn't relevant. Blizzards is.

I can't recall ever in my life having that attitudes about men.
Certainly I've never expressed it here. Perhaps you're projecting?
