There *is* justification for killing Mith Marr actually - he doesn't
view it as a "kill" as much as a necessary "challenge". You have to
prove yourself worthy of his information. None of the gods in the
planes below Time are the real version of the god anyways.

That said, the argument for why you are killing Xegony or Coirnav
(champion for three gods) or Rathe are all *much* weaker since none of
the gods involved in those are evil or even a threat. But then, SOE
hasn't had a storyline both relevent to play and worth dogshit since
Velious.

Storylines get in the way of grinding and phat lewtz.
