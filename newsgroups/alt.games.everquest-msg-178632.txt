I well understand your point, and deeply sympathize.  It's kinda nice to be
able to make an educated guess at a glance where someone got their armor.

However, the new armor tints will allow for individuals to express more
control over their appearance, which is a good thing, I think.

Plus...

...I'll *finally* be able to get rid of my pink armor!  Salubrious Heraldic
Armor has some nice stats for something player-made, but man... I've even
had my guild leader asking me to go in on drops so that I can get rid of my
pink armor.

While I'm not *that* bothered by the obvious jokes, at the same time it'll
be nice to be able to give myself an appearance that won't make others smirk
in derision.  =)
