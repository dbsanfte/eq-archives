Hah - no software, actually - or at least there wasn't when I got it.  
Of course, they've jacked up the fee now - it *was* $5 a month, which I 
thought was pretty reasonable.  But before I made up my mind they upped 
it to $9 something, which made up my mind for me. :)

That's it, Annie.  Let's you and me get together and write our own damn 
MMORPG game!  I've also got certain ideas for an 'adult' version of The 
Sims - I mean hell, there you are, your hubby is out breaking his back 
earning a living, and there's that hot speedo-clad 'maid' bending over 
to empty the trash...

::cough:: Have your secretary call my secretary.

Don't you mean 'ironic'? ;p  Have you SEEN some of the rules for 
Disneyland employees?

But see, I hate, hate, HAAAAAAAAAATE the "I'll add you if you add me!" 
system of 'friends'.  Loathe it!  I keep AIM set to block anybody I 
don't specifically add, my Livejournal friends list is peopled by those 
I know and care about and the *occasional* humor journal or one I've 
found by hitting the 'random' button (although that usually leads to 
people I really, really can live without knowing better ;p), and I have 
about a dozen e-mails set up for filtering different levels of friends 
and family.
