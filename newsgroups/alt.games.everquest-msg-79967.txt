Do what I did, turn the music down all the way. Its an EQ problem, not a SB
Live problem, so until they fix it, I will leave the music off. I actually
like it better with the music off, now that I have played this way for a
couple weeks.

You should be able to turn all the models on, and all the graphics up with
512 ram on your system, so don't let the music issues spoil it for you.
