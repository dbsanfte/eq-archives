Ok, so I went again tonight for the 13th time. Yeah, I'm getting dangerously
close to teenaged fantasy victims area (good thing I'm too old for that!).
It's gone. This was the last night it was showing in our little town, so
I'll shut the hell up after this. The manager guessed it might be out on DVD
in 6 months, but I think it may be much less (though I've been known to be
wrong before ;)) He let me and my sister in law in for free, since I've been
such a good customer... and where would you get that but in a small town?
Every time I see it, I see something new. I re-read the book (after 30
years, it was pretty well obscured by all the crap I've had to remember in
the meantime!), and finished it last night... I've got There and Back Again
(or The Hobbitt), which I will also re-read. Yeah, out of order, but hey,
what can I say? One thing -- in the movie, Lord Elrond seems to be depicted
as an elf. But in the book, it says he's a half elf. I haven't read as much
of Tolkien's works as I should have (though I will, after this), so is this
covered somewhere other than The Fellowship of The Rings?  And obviously,
according to Peter Jackson, they are as long-lived as elves. This true?

just wondering,
Dark
