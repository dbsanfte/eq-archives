*nods* Just a little something to toss out here for the hopeful folks still
after their boots. JBoots do not even come close to being the speed at which
Hasten runs. So don't get your hopes up. Honestly speaking, they are the
speed of the level 5 bard song.

They are rather nice to have, however. :) So don't be disappointed when you
finally do get your boots. My guy's a mere lvl 51 now and they will always -
as far as I can tell - be a part of his hotkeys.

As an aside, and this may start a whole new conversation, a character's
agility MAY effect their running speed. A friend of mine has JBoots on her
rogue, and with neither of us being over weighted nor with any other buffs,
she will quickly outdistance me every time. And her character's a much lower
level, currently.

All of her characters tend to run faster then mine, though, regardless of
race / class. The only constant factor across all of them are their very
high (140 and up) agility stats. :)

So, at the very least, it's something to ponder over,
~Me
