I've seen many parts of musical instruments at the vendors, apart from
the ubiquitous Box of Lute strings... Is there such a thing as a
instrument-making skill? It looks like it may be there, but
unimplemented.

Also, does anybody know if the Mail Delivery quests are bugged? It has
happened to me a couple of times to hand mail in, and get nothing but
the standard "Don't know what to do with this" answer. Once, I would
have chalked it up to picking the wrong NPC (would be nice if the letter
said who it is addressed to. Would be even nicer if you could read your
"notes" file from within EQ).

Thanks.
