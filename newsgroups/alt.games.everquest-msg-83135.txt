Just because you use unpronouncable, meaningless and uninteresting "Dragon
Lance" like names does not deter me from adding a little humor or fun to my
gameplay. Even J.R.R. Tolkien had humurous names inserted into his story
line i.e. Barliman Butterburr and Bilbo Baggins, which with enough
imagination and/or paranoia could easily have sexual connotations. These
names were created to be FUN to say and to be memorable. I try to do the
same.

Just because you lack control in your own life, does not mean that you
should assert your own presumed morality upon others you know nothing
about.Your rigidity does NOT contribute to the overall gameplay, but
instead, creates a rather hostile environment for those simply wanting to
have fun.
