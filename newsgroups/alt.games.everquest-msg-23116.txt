I sure didn't see it, but I'm glad to hear there is something.

Quests divided by faction like this aren't so annoying, since
its no drop and I'm "can't get any worse" in KD I'll just
destroy it.... but at least next time I can ask if there's
anyone in the zone on Giant faction before destroying it.

Wyvern stingers... has there -ever- been a rogue in CS?
I wonder if my level 16 agnostic halfling can sneak the
quest, he already has his CS fang.
