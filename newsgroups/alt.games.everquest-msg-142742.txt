The Internet has definately enabled people to organize better.
Now you just need to convince people to stop buying music from
the big media companies.  (That is, until they start treating
their customers like humans instead of criminals.)

I'm skepical that people will organize effectively, though...

: Don't be too sure. The act of fighting piracy is a way to stop losses,
: not to earn income. And fighting piracy in the courts isn't cheap, nor
: even particularly effective.

Theoretically, the government (translation: you and me) would
be paying for a lot of the anti-piracy efforts, which would be
funded by tax dollars.

(Actually, I'm just guessing.  I don't know who, exactly, pays
for anti-piracy activities.  When I hear about the FBI cracking
down on the latest piracy ring, I just assume it's all funded
with tax dollars.)

: Sales of individual MP3 files. I'd be happy to spend, oh, fifty cents
: per MP3 file direct from the source. Especially if I can say to myself
: "I'd love to have a copy of that song", and be able to go receive a
: high-quality download of it instantly without having to search all
: over. I'm sure I'm not alone in that.

I'd probably spend a LOT more on music if such a system were
in place.  And you'd think it'd generate lots of impulse sales,
too.

However, I'm concerned that the bulk of the market is teenage
and college age people who'd happily make the extra effort to
find the music for free on their favorite P2P network.  Or
perhaps one student would buy some MP3s and share with all
their friends on campus.

More information on demographics would help me here.  That is,
how much money different age groups spend on music.  I must
admit I'm too lazy to look it up.

: The RIAA could pretty much pocket all of it, less bandwidth costs and
: royalties. And they wouldn't have to share those profits with
: distribution middlemen, stores, or packaging companies. Make a single
: MP3, stick it on a high powered web site, and take the checks to the
: bank. Pretty simple business model.

I wonder if the big media companies fear this approach because
if it succeeds, the big performers could start selling their
music the same way.  (That is, once they're established and
successful.)  Who needs the big media companies to process a
few credit cards and upload MP3s to your computer?

: And I don't think that it would kill the CD market, either. The
: availability of MP3s hasn't kept me from buying CDs. I like having
: master-quality recordings of an artists complete work. And many times
: I've discovered songs on a CD that never received air-time, but were
: far better (IMO) than the song I bought the CD for in the first place.
: And again, I'm sure I'm not alone.

I'm honestly unsure how MP3s have affected CD sales.  My hunch
would be that CD sales in the younger age brackets have gone
down due to the proliferation of MP3s.  I think must adults are
willing to pony up the dough for the Real Deal, though.

: True, but don't discount the power of marketing on the web. Consider
: the very modest example of my own web site - it gets on average 15,000
: hits per month. Do you know how much marketing that required? None -
: it was all word of mouth. An individual artist or small group could do
: the same with their music.

True, but playing on MTV gets your music/video into the ears/eyes
of millions of people in one shot.  A powerful marketing force
that dwarfs word of mouth.  And I think most artists want to get
rich, if possible, just like the rest of us.

(At least I know I do!)

: Besides which, marketing via the web doesn't preclude traditional
: avenues in any way.

True, though I have my doubts the big media companies would sign
anyone who insists on also marketing their own product direct via
the Internet.

: From the individual artist who is relatively unknown, it's quite
: possible that they'll make more money by the "underground" methods
: than through being backed by large corporations. There are artists who
: pull SRO audiences for live shows, due almost entirely to
: word-of-mouth who you will virtually never hear on the radio.

Good point.  In fact, maybe we'd be better off with less
uber-popular artists and more moderately popular artists.
More variety.  And probably better music.

: Are they getting rich? Certainly not. But they're doing what they
: love, and making a living at it. And that's enough for many artists -
: to be able to support themselves the way they want.

Sounds good to me.

:>We'll see if they ever actually DO get bitch slapped, though.
:>So far, they seem quite effective at buying the government.

: Yeah, I was kind of noticing that too.

*sigh*  :(
