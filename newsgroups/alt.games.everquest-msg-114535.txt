> Sounded to me like that cleric really was a lootwhore. Good riddance.

Good riddance doesnt always work well though. You are assuming that they can
do everything without her that they could have done with her. This is not
usually the case. Even if you have known loot whores randoming serves to
keep them quiet while still keeping them at raids. And if for some reason
you where mistaken and NOT spreading the loot around equally it gets fixed.

Its real easy to dismiss someone who gets annoyed and leaves as a loot
whore. Makes you feel so much better being able to label them and dismiss
them as unimportant. Question though, at what point would you consider it ok
to leave if a guild if they where never giving you any loot? If it always
went to someone else? Would you stay forever never getting any loot? If not
then you are also a loot whore :p You are really arguing about when it is ok
to leave and claiming that she left far to early.

I have watched many major guilds break up and it is always about loot. I
have never seen a guild that randoms ever break up over loot. Mine has
officers calling loot and it is the primary cause of most major arguments.
It also causes a severe lacking in attendence of certain needed classes at
many raids.
