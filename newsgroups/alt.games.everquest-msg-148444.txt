Get yourself 4 or 5 more points of Stamina.  You want your stamina at or
above 100.  After that, AC, HP, more STA.  You already have both Dex and Agi
at 75+.  STR will have a very minimal impact on your damage production.  As
a ranger, you are primarily a melee character, so you need to mitigate the
damage you take, and have as much hp as possible.  AC will mitigate damage,
HP is obvious, Stamina will give you more HP.  Stamina over 100 means that
you will not slow down in combat when you stamina bar (yellow one) is empty.
If you find yourself constantly having issues with encumbrance, then you
might consider some STR, but you are better off just putting stuff you don't
need to have with you in the bank.
