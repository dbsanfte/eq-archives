ranger I guess because of their history.. its just a stereotype nowadays.

examples of dieing to hit a bank...  you just ran all the way to sebilis (a
keyed dungeon) and forgot your key.. you can either port and run for 15+
mins, or you can die outside, get your key, and get rezzed back.

im not surprised you'd think i ignore you, knowing yourself how mean to me
you are.. but nope, i dont (yet!!)

lol ns.  I have 3 accounts... lots of alts.. and I STILL occupy half the
bank of 2 different people (on multiple chars if theirs)..  can i buy a
premium 20 slot bank account? :)

I generally never ever have downtime..  im either "soloing" (using my
cleric/shaman to kill downtime), faming ssra (which is nonstop endless
killing), pulling on a raid (again, endless)..  or c.ring the raid or group
heh.

I have to make a real effort to keep up with chat rooms, guild chat and
tells as is.. so seeing "Whats best for monks??? Iskar or human???"
"somebody got some free monk gear on xxxxxx??" spammed over the screen.. no
thanks :)

the monk pleveling just died, or your monk just trained my monk?  if the
latter, id solo them all and then tell you to consent me, and then id laugh
at you :)
