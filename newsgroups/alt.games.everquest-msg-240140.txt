If this were that type of game you might have a point. The main
problem here is you start buck naked, and Sony goes.. ok, play
Everquest. But you can't, except on a rudimentary basis.. you're level
1.. you don't got shit on, can't raid, can't do shit except level. As
you level, you hopefully get equipment that you can use to make your
character worthwhile and eventually you get to the point where you can
actually PLAY the game.. which, in EQ is knocking stuff over and
breaking things for better loot that you had to kill the mob to get.
Now, you're gonna get pissy that some people decide as a service to
provide you the ability for a charge to get reasonable equipment to
get started with? Or an influx of plat so you can actually BUY the
stuff you need to be productive in the bazaar? If you are, then i say
you are an exclusionistic asshole that just wants to keep new people
out of the game unless they spend a year farming shit they aren't
going to use when they get a real guild. Seriously, if EQ is going to
be the manufacturer of items to be used in game, I really don't see
why its a shock that there are resellers and suppliers. Imagine if in
order to play golf you had to go buy shoes, bag, cart, gloves, clubs,
tees, and whatever from Sony and they wouldn't give them to you unless
you spend a month or so getting each.

So do you consider any of the industries that have sprung up around
golf or any other 'game' to have done the 'wrong thing'? They're all
spending time making money off the game they play, that they didn't
create. Is that corrupt? Is that immoral? Sh'yeah, right.
