Absolutely - can't have too many of either

Not so much Lure as DragonsBane/GiantsBane being a 'can't ever have too
much' part of the raid.

Pre-fight buffs, during fight debuffs, excellent back-up healing

Ubermob raids require enc buffing although they have a restricted mid-
fight role. Though a charmed 20khp mob makes a nice pet hehe

How about Rangers?  Pred and Trueshot for a start

How about Bards?  +atk songs, stackable DS, and a whole range of resists
and regens for every occasion

A mage or three?   DS, mod rods, CoH, epic pet, and some good nukes

A funeral of necros? Manadumping may not be glamorous, but being a
battery to a DB/GB wiz will translate into 10s of k more damage, plus FD
and res ability and heal DoT on MT

A kite of Druids? PoG plus DS, resists and good healing

An honour of Paladins?  200 free hps to everyone on the raid, and
instacast CH each death


I'm sure I've forgotten someone, as well as ignored countless pluses to
the above classes. All I'm trying to point out is that just about every
class brings something to the table of ubermob raids, and no class is
useless or unwanted
