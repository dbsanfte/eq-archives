So I guess I'm doing something terribly wrong. I spent 5 hours
yesterday trying to figure out where I got what message and where to
go. I zoned into PoK probably 20 times, never got a message. Went to
my hometown: no message. Went to Rathe: no message.

Tried asking around on serverwide.age, got the useful hints like talk
to your guildmaster and hit a for action (thanks guys, i really
appreciate all the help - and no i didn't try that). At least I
contained my frustration and didn't yell at anybody.

So I logged out and checked that my pre-order for LDON went through.
I'm listed as having the expansion. /sigh

Now I can make the futile attempt to contact support or /petition...
but I can't help but feel that I'm doing something wrong because I
haven't heard of anybody else having these problems.

So my question is, is anybody else having problems? Any suggestions
you can give me (I'm a high elf, my hometown should be Felwithe
unless... who knows...)

I even went so far as to have someone show me who I'm supposed to talk
to, but they won't talk to me. They'll turn and look my way, but
that's about the most excitement I got yesterday. bah.

Please help...
