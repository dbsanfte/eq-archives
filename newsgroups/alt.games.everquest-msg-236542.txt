"Percentage" is just a form of saying the same thing. The numbers and
formula look different, but it ends up in the same place.

So yes, its quite all right to say zones have a percentage exp
modifier. There's a base most zones use; 75 if I remember correctly
for the raw number. Zones with a different number can have it
expressed as a percentage thereof. Say Kurns with a whopping 150 raw
would be a 100% percent zone bonus (or again in a different way, 200%
of base mob exp) - mobs killed there are worth twice as much as a mob
in North Karana. It all means the same thing. Blackburrow has a raw
value of 100; that is 33% zone bonus or 133% the base mob experience.
Yucky old LoIO has a raw of 60, so a zone penalty of 20% or 80% the
base mob experience.
