What?  Whoa!  A point?  I'm not sure we can allow those in this thread...

}I have pet lizards, and while researching their care and breeding I
}learned something the general public doesn't realise,

Heheh, another lovely little known lizard fact: know anything about the 
gender and mating habits of the California Whiptail? :)

}but animal
}breeders have known for a long time: not all traits pre-determined are
}simply "genetic".  For example if you clone a cat, the clone will be
}the same colour as the original (genetic), but the colour pattern will
}be different (pre-determined before birth, but not "genetic").

Is this the tortoiseshell thing?  As I recall, what coloration the cat has 
is genetic, yes, but the actual distribution of the colors is determined 
after birth by a variety of factors that I can't remember for sure... Oh! 
I think it was sex-linked, and relates to which x chromosome contracts 
into a barr body at some stage of development.

}I am not an expert in the field, but from what I gather there would be
}three types of traits "built-in" at birth:
}1- genetic traits- a cat has "the gene(s)" that makes it a white and
}orange tabby
}2- predetermined but not strictly genetic-  the actual pattern of a
}cat's fur, which is fixed before birth but either random or determined
}by some function not based solely on genetics

There are a few traits like that, although I don't think coat coloration 
is generally one of them.  Theory suggests that it is related to the 
makeup of the rest of the fertilized egg, ie, whether it ended up having 
certain key proteins in a sufficent amount pre-made.

}3- Traits built on a complex combination of genes- a clone would
}inherit the trait, but most offspring would not.

Yeah, that's just genetics. :)

}This muddies the nature vs. nurture argument even more!

Heheh, and I suspect, -if- sexuality is genetic, it's definitely in 
category #3.  That's where current research is pointing, at least.  That 
said though, I still don't like it.  I like free will.  It's good. :)
