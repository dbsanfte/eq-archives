Been that way for about a year now.  SOE changed so people won't
accidently give more than single item now.  I guess it's more to spare
the GM the aggrivation of tracking down lost items or to stop fielding

You hand more then one item at once (not a stack, but anything greater
than single), NPC will refuse.
