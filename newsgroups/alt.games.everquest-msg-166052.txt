In the bazaar, blue diamonds were selling between 800-900... so i understand
3 of them are needed  ... so where is the rest of the cost? Also, i could
have thought that the bags sold for about 9 k, so unless the fail rate is
really high at skill 250, i would have thought it would be profiable.
Besides, if you can farm nightmare silk, the silk strings go for 800-1000,
and they are way triv to my tailor of 176.

I was buying them for 300-400 as I cannot farm them being a mere newbie at
52, but I expect someone with greater ambition could be making terrific
profits from tailoring.
