Well, notice I did say messageboards afterwards as well, and that is
probably where the majority of this subject matter lies.  Newsgroups
generally seem to have a higher quality of poster probably because people
still do not know how to operate newsgroups after all these years or they
just find web message boards more convenient.  I agree that threads of this
nature are few and far between in this setting (newsgroups) but I see no
problem with someone going down that avenue if they wish.  Just be glad you
do not read particular EQ server message boards or many of the web
communities (EQVault, Stratics, etc).  Every other post there is either a
childish flame or a reason why someone is quitting. :)  I find this typical
of all mmorpg's and to my disbelief, even ones in beta that people do not
have to pay for!  I can't count how many times someone has posted a message
similar to this about why they are quitting Dark Age of Camelot or Anarchy
Online.  In that instance, I think you would have a valid argument in making
a counterpost such as this.  But I really see no problem here.

Well, I mean something more public like say playing a game on MSN Gaming
Zone or Heat.net.

Yes, there are lots of things people cannot fathom in this world. :)  But to
be honest, I always make sure to check out a thread that has a subject like
this.  I find them interesting to read for one reason or another. I do not
know the reason myself.  When I quit the game and move on, I will try not to
tell the world so I do not piss you off. :P

Perhaps the answer to why I care about this silly stuff can be found at the
bottom of my signature though.  In the "What kind of MUD'er are you test?,"
I almost double everything else when it comes to socializing.  I hold this
to be true.  In all honesty, community and friends and just plain messing
around are what keep me attracted to MMOG's.  I generally grow tired of the
actual game very fast and lose the urge to really play it.  As for why I
keep an account and log on every day?  That is another mystery.  No idea how
I managed to play Ultima Online over two years, cancelling my account on two
occassions and returning.  Luckily new games on the horizon so I probably
won't experience that with EQ.
