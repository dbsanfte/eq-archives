The other option would be to install your disks on his machine, and have him
use your old account instead of his new one.  If he has a really high level
well developed character, he can pay SOE to transfer it to the new account
(your old one).  Either way he can then stop using his new account that he's
paid for, and use yours instead.

Either way, some part of your joint purchases are going to waste, either
your copy of POP or his copy of the rest of the game.

Plus, having him use your account is technically against the EULA, while him
buying a new copy of POP isn't...
