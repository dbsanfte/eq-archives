I'm wondering if anyone has a listing of spell aggro levels or knows 
what field or fields on the Lucy listing will translate to aggro.

I'm particularly interested, of course, in SK spells, but also would 
like to compare to Paladin spells, and to some of the more annoying 
spells other classes cast such as Slow and Ensnare (versus Snare) and so on.

I've noticed that it seems resisted spells often generate more hate than 
ones which actually land; slow in particular I've seen many comment on.

I wonder about spells to which the mob is immune, by virtue of level and 
by virtue of being assigned immunity.  I've heard, for example, that one 
of the best aggro spells for an SK is a fear which cannot land.

Damage spells, I've heard, generate hate via the amount of damage they 
do; is there a multiplier for this, does one spell generate more hate 
than another at a given amount of damage?

How about DOTs?  Do they generate hate as though a new damage spell was 
being cast each time a tic lands; the equivalent of chain nuking, only 
being able to do new more annoying things while they land?

I have a feeling for much of this, but I'd love to see actual numbers, 
or even estimated numbers.  I can think of some experiments to generate 
some numbers, at least to start out with, but I'm betting much of the 
work has already been done by people with far more time and inclination; 
the same people who parse 8 hour long logs to find out about how proc 
rates work and so on.
