I love my wizzy, he is 36 now and almost 37.  I think I have a good
reputation and have impressed many groups that I have joined even though
they were skeptical at first as to what a wizzy can bring to a group.
Finishing off a mob is the number one role, but don't forget the stuns. I
use a stun and the fighters can take free shots at the mob for five secs.  I
still find myself shouting for groups all the time, but if all else fails I
solo.  I can go where I want, when I want.  Hey I can even shout that im
porting and whore myself for money.  Nobody wants me?  I can do it myself
can a warrior, sk, monk, ranger or chanter say that at 37, nope.  But I
guarantee when others see you soloing with ease, the invitations start
coming in...

Onaar(7th hammer)
no last name, no guild as a wizzy should be....
