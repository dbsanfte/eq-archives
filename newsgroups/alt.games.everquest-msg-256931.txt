This is the old 'fear is based on charisma' argument. Devs have said it 
is not. According to dev proclomation, (take that for what it is worth, 
though he did say he went and checked the code to be sure), chr has the 
following effects:
cost of items
resistance and duration of charm spells you can cast.
Note that in the case of the charms, Enchanters and bards are on a 
different table from other charm capable classes, requiring more 
charisma to get a positive benefit (I guess it makes balance sense, but 
why a necro with 150 cha gets more benefit from Cha while charming than 
I do at 200 does not make a whole lot of real sense to me)
There is no effect of chr, high or low, on fear effects. (the main rumor 
was that fear was more effective with a lower charisma)

Of course, I could be wrong too. But that is the information I had 
available 2 years ago, straight from the horses a-uhh mouth.

btw a decent, though expensive in both time and money chr item for 
people who don't use range slots (I know you do, thus not an option) are 
the grandmaster craftsmen dohickies.
10 str/int/wis, 50 chr - pri, sec, ranged
