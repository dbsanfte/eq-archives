Yes, to an extent. Saying that warriors have "superior" melee skills
was hyperbole I am sure; the two are about even. The ranger atk bonus
and buffs balancing out the extra damage the warrior gets from triple
attack. To get ahead the ranger has to be casting (and ranger nukes
are almost always resisted at the high end). In the end rangers do do
a very slight more than a warrior given equivalent weapons, but not
very much, and certainly not enough to warrant taking a ranger if a
warrior is available.

Bow damage is only significantly better than melee during the stretch
after getting AM3 but before getting elemental weapons. Before and
after then melee is better.

Contrary to what Davian said, ranger weapons are not significantly
higher ratio than warrior weapons for the most part. Most of the best
elemental weapons are actually usable by both, like EoE and SEWS...
though the warrior gets well ahead in the case of two handers because
of triple attack. Warrior pet weapon is 15/19, ranger is 16/20.. no
significant difference.

So if there is no notable weapon ratio difference in PoP (and none
earlier either, bloodfrenzy is about as good as the claw, and the NToV
differences are trivial), how about GoD? Jagged Onyx Staff is usable
by both. Darkblade of the Warlord is 38/35 compared to Darkglint Blade
for ranger at 39/33 - the one and only time the ranger weapon has any
sort of edge on the warrior one at all.

So anyone claiming ranger weapons have an edge on warrior weapons is
FOS. Maybe they are confusing rangers with rogues, who do actually get
a slight edge in ratios.

In terms of which classes are suffering the most right now, rangers
rank very much near or at the top (mages might put up an argument).
It's not just grass is greener comments. Calling it that is ignorance.
Rangers are outdpsed by even classes that aren't dps, have no role
OTHER than dps in groups, and because of that enjoy only the heyday of
BoT when they might have an elemental bow while grouping in places
most other people have no elemental gear at all in.
