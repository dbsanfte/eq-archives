Crowd control, while not exclusivly an Enchanter specialty, is what they
excell at.
Crowd control is using spells or abilities to keep multiple mobs from
overwhelming
the group during a battle.  Enchanters use mezmerizes and stuns to keep mobs
that wander by from adding to the fight. They also stun and mez when the
main
tank pulls multiple mobs from a crowded area.  A good enchanter can hold up
to
5 or 6 mobs back and let the group pull them 1 at a time to battle. But the
group
has to know how to fight within the Enchanters abilities. If they each keep
hitting
different mobs, then the mezz's and stuns won't stay and can be disaterous.
I play a 34 enchanter on the Mith Marr server and during my 25th -30th lvls
was a VERY popular player in the Ill Omen Sarnak fort.  At times I would
hold
mobs for 2 different groups inside on the upper ledge. Enchanters doing only
crowd
control can have lots of mana left to support as long as good groups are
careful.
Druids, Bards, and sometimes the mixed casters can also crowd control, but
not
with the tools that an Enchanter can.
