The Giant Mastery is in TS.  There is a gnoll camp in the NW area of
the map that has a clickable tarp.  You get the mastery from there.

I don't know TS very well at all, otherwise I would give better
directions.  I just got that mastery last night, but had to follow a
friend the entire way since the zone is still mostly black to me.
