I have seen very few Beastlords on FV (only 2-3 in my travels other
than myself). It really depends on where you spend your time though.
If you are in the Freeport area you won't see many Shaman, but if you
are near Qeynos you will run into quite a few.

The server has a low population compared to most others. You will find
it to be very quiet. Sunday night there were less than 15 players in
Oasis durring the prime evening hours (PDT). Almost any class you pick
will be a "rarity" unless you are in a specific newbie area. The
biggest difficulty on the server is finding a regular group.

>Thanks for your opinions and I know I probably spelled FV wrong.

Jump in and test the waters. I am completely hooked on FV. The server
has a completely different vibe than all of the others. The best way I
can describe it is like moving to a small town after living in New
York or LA.
