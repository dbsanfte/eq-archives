Statwise they are equal to or better. Put all of your starting points
into STA no matter what race you pick. With a Shaman partner you can
have many of the Iksar advantages through the use of buffs.

Iksar Pros:
Regen (Shaman get thier first a regen spell at 24)
AC Bonus (@40 raw AC at level 60 if memory serves) (Shaman get great
HP and AC buffs)
Infravision (Shaman get an Infravision spell at level 9)
Forage

Iksar Cons
Faction
20% EXP penalty (for every level an Iksar has to earn 1 more yellow
bubble than a human)

Regen is great for both the Shaman and the Monk. At level 24 Shaman
get their first Canabalize spell. They can convert HPs to Mana. At
lower levels the Regen is really nice to have. One BIG negatice for
the Iksar Shaman is that they cannot use the Jaundiced Bone Bracer. It
has a right-click 236pt ,manaless DD effect that starts to work at
level 45.

You should never play a race/class that you are not comfortable
playing. Play what you want to play. The main thing is that you play
together. Any duo will work (some are more efficient than others), so
don't force yourself or your partner to play a class/race they are not
happy with.
