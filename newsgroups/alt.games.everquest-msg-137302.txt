Main should not switch targets unless an unmezzable mob (or one
that is very hard to mez) enters the combat.. and then he
should be very very clear that the target is being changed.

Tanks need to learn to rely utterly on the chanter to solve
all problems with adds.  Actually, clerics and paladins can
help with zero damage stuns, and no damage roots
can be used, bards can help out... but no tank mez.  The
other solutions are all methods of buying time for chanter
mez to go thru without any chance of breaking a mez that
gets thru right before the "save me" breaks it.

Once everyone has digested this, its possible to designate
a SA to "off tank" when you face multiple unmezzables,
or to kill off pets, which are often not worth the time
and energy to mez.
