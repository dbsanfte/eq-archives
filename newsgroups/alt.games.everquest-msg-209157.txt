You have any idea how absurd that sounds. "Hey, let's do something for
no reason other than to inconvenience certain players just to irritate
them". I honestly think it was a game engine limitation. Even after
the advent of Warders and Familiars, those pets didn't really zone
with you, they died on zone out, then insta-summoned on zone-in.
(Notice that warders didn't keep buffs or weapons when the BST zoned
or logged). This was more of a work-around, and was done by linking
the pet to a buff (Which faded every 10 hours or so, as perma-buffs
create some kind of problem with character files).

Magicians, necromancers, etc didn't get the work-around because they
had already had a long-running history of losing pets when zoning.
Keeping pets was a perk of Beastlords, and was really more of a
"parlor trick" than a useful feature. The only thing that can zone is
a Player Character. Pets don't zone because they're not PCs. Game
design limitation.
