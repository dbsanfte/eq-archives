After just getting my pet at level 9 with my beastlord, i was wondering if i
could tell him to guard an area and get him to farm for silks and hides
whilst i go off and get xp near by?

I've tried it a couple of times but he just sits there and does nothing. Im
trying this in shadeweavers thicket near the town/guild area to get silks
and pelts for my tailoring.

Any help always welcome.
