There are two different places to fall.   If you fall off the bridge leading
to the monk guild area (House of Midst), there is a tunnel you drop down to
fall into Paudal Caverns.

If you fall off the bridge leading from the Frodel part of town out to
Paudal, there is no exit to that part that I am aware of.   Either get
someone to port you out, or die under the bridge and /corpse to solid
ground.
