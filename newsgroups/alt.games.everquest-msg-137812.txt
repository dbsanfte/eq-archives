My 24th level necro partnered with a monk (25th) in Paludal and it was a
BLAST!  He pulled non-stop and I rarely went under 50% mana.  I don't know
if the partnership would be as good at other levels and in other situations,
but I have to say it was one of the most memorable times I've had since
starting to play.

By the way the Paineel newbie grounds is one of the best. I don't like the
Warrens-shudder-but maybe you will have better luck there.  I would
recommend the sewers in Qeynos (after about 4th level), I levelled my necro
there very quickly.  A necro and monk kicking ass in the sewers would be a
lot of fun and with a partner you wouldn't have to worry about getting
supplies and stuff.

I have a shaman also (30th level now) and partnered her with a monk friend
of mine and it was fun too, but somehow not the same "rush" as the
monk-necro combo.  I think because with the shaman I spent most of my time
buffing and healing and not really involved in the fight.
