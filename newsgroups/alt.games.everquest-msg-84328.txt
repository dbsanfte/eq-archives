	I'm not "complaining bitterly" about it, but I have decided that I'm not
showing up for anything my guild does that's smaller than a major raid for an
epic quest piece.

	Starting at level 55 I spent all my playing time for about five months
going to public Hate raids trying for my emerald.  That's a lot of levelling
time to make up for.
