Aye, thats the ultimate rude for me, there you minding your own,
especially if you dont have LFG on.. and x invites you to join a
group.. If x isnt someone I know, I decline. If they do it again I
check their level, if its below xp I ask them why they are being
silly, otherwise I point out politely that I feel its rude that they
havent even said Hi and would I like to first.

(I have a similar message on my inspect too, I dont mind people
looking at my equipment I mind when they just look though)
