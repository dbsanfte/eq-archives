Most LDoN adventure types are extended trials -- you really want every
bit of mana regen you can get.  If you want a more relaxed atmosphere
and still want a good shot at winning - decline adventures until you get
a "Kill X number of mobs" adventure.  Usually around 50, with 90 minutes
to do it.  They are easy to finish without havin to optimize for DPS and
you don't have to worry about wrong turns, or bad luck with the RNG causing
you to fail.
