First off NEVER put "Bards" in the tank catagory. Yes, they can wear
plate, but so can a cleric......I am not saying that bards are a bad
class (they are one of the best if you have the wrists for twisting),
then simply are not tanks.

If you only count regular exp groups 1-54, then the simple answer is
"no, warriors are not *enough* better". SK/Pal/Rng(to a lesser extent)
can all take/generate agro faster than a warrior. With decent
equipment they can tank just as well in almost any situation.

The fact that you are asking this question leads me to suspect that
you would be happier playing a hybrid class. (PAL/SK/RNG) You will get
utility spells, and also plenty of in-your-face melee.
