EQ's still strong and will likely be around for a long time. Sure,
players are leaving for the newer games, but so far, they've tended to
come back. FF XI is probably pulling the largest amount of players
that stay gone right now. But, again, EQ has a large "pool" of players
to pull from. It's going to be a long time before it gets down far
enough that they'll have to shut down. They've still got expansion(s)
in the works. First thing that'll happen before it shuts down is
they'll stop expanding, and I don't see that for at the very minimum
another year and a half, and that's only if something ground-breaking
comes out.
