Does anyone know if IC and EW are in the same box on the server farm?

Usually if a zone or 2 is brought down, they anounce a list of other zones
(which I presume are in the smae box as the faulty zone) which are also
coming down.

That might be an idea for passing the time during the next uber-patch... try
and work out from those announcements which zones are in the same box :o)
