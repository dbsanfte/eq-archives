Aye - but those are just Darwinian common sense testing devices. A person
should never think they live in a society advanced enough to disregard the
laws of nature.

The biggest problem of course that the locals, knowing the dangers
instinctively deal with it sensibly (mostly - and some get blase) and this
appearance gives a false sense of security to others (tourists etc) who are
unaware of the dangers and see the carefree locals as evidence of there
being no danger.

Most common scenario involve Japanese tourist's swimming in the ocean for
the first time thinking it is safe as everyone else is in the water having a
ball and discovering that ocean/beach swimming is markedly different from
reef/beach or pool swimming to their dire peril.
