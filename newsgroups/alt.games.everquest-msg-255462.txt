I'd come out from Dulak, sat and regenned/BW'd back to full hp, killed a 
mystic in Gunthak (definately doable, but risky, as I can only interrupt 
about half the casts solo), then invised and ran all the way back out 
the tunnel before the game dropped with me halfway accross the water to 
the lighthouse.  Came back in, I was at the zone line from Dulak again, 
at half HP and without the exp from the mystic kill, had to make the 
whole "man I hope invis doesn't drop" run all over again... trouble 
being, if I get a train behind me all I can do is arrange to die on the 
beach in a nice location, because I can't swim fast enough to 
outdistance the mobs.  As it turns out I got lucky this time as well, 
but I'll never go to Dulak again without two cloudy potions to come home 
with.

 From any LDoN adventure camp, magus to North Ro, run to the dock and 
tell the gnome you want to go to Iceclad, run to TOFS; its not all that 
far from pretty much anywhere these days.  A porter could take you 
directly to Iceclad, but its a longer and more dangerous run from the 
circle to TOFS, heck, Iceclad port itself can be suicide for a low level 
wizard porter, if he zones slowly he can end up nearly dead before his 
screen comes up.

Every expansion it seems Norrath gets more zones but gets smaller.
