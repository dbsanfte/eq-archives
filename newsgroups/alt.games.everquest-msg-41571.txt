Nearly every day it seems something has been screwed up with EverQuest.
Today I go in and find my subscription has been canceled.  After making two
long distance calls and spending 30 minutes between them on hold and being
transferred around, I find out why.  Some idiot submitted the monthly charge
on my credit card but didn't enter the expiration date, I'm sorry though you
will have to update your account we can't submit the charge again to fix it.

Dumb Ass moron
how about someone at Verant doing their job right the first time.  It's
usually the patch that has been screwed up.  You would think this level of
incompetence Sony might wake up and fire a bunch.
Wishful thinking on my part.
