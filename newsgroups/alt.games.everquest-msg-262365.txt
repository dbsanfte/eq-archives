I've been meaning to do this for a while so here it goes..
(Please don't mind my noting miniscule things such as spacing, but I
figure since I'm doing this anyway, I might as well point it out.)

I'd add the ability to lull/soothe/pacify, which especially in LDoNs

> guilds are trying to build up the strength (number of top-level
> seriously-equipped players of enough classes) to join the top-Planes
> raiding rotation of their server; some make it and some don't.
>

>      When in LDoN if somone has the Eye of Zomm spell have them use it to
> scout ahead so the mobs can be lulled before the pull.
>  If no one in the party has Zomm then the puller can go into 3rd person
> mode and slowly back up to the doorway. Then they can see around the
> corners for adds to be lulled.
> 
>      Make a hotkey for looting, makes it a lot easier while doing LDoN's.
> first line= /target a 
> second line= /pause 2
> third line= /loot
> 
>       Be warned, though, if you have a group member whose name starts with

> Usually one person can do both jobs at the same time. 
> 
> Rampage is an extra round of attacks, that a mob can do, that hits the

> At the point of agroing a mob, a MA and rampage tank will "agro" it.

> Some map tips:
> 
> 1. If you pull up the maps and can't see anything then zoom the map out by
> clicking on the "-" button on the side of
> the map, you man have to click this button many times, alternately if you
> have a mouse with a scroll wheel you can hover your
> mouse pointer over the map and zoom the map in and out with the scroll
> wheel. Also turn off the height filter, this will show all the lines on the
> maps.
> 
> 2. If the map is hard to see because the lines are too light then right
> click on the title bar of the map and change the 'Alpha'
> 'fade' and 'normal' levels to lighten the background of the map. This
> allows you to see the map and the screen behind it so it doesn't block your
> view. This is why so many maps are drawn with grey lines.
