I was just in Najena this past weekend and saw about five
hilts drop, so I'm not sure why the quest would be broke
unless they removed them earlier this week.   Got one for
a paladin in about 10 minutes, 9 of which were spent killing
magicians looking for mage focus item component drops.

Simply standing at the top of the entrance to the spider and
goblin caves would seem to be a good tactic for pulling;  my
cleric got agro'd there every time he didn't stay close to the
far wall.   From the spawn rate, I'd imagine a paladin could
go there, get the one spawn, sit and med, and be ready for
the next all without any trouble.
