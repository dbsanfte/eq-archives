Vah Shir bards get some very nice instruments via low level quests, though,
if you have a fortune to twink with this isn't a concern of course... but
if not (hey, I'm only a 59 cleric, I can't afford much) its really a nice
hidden racial bonus.

In addition, you get Safe Fall at 50, racially, thats better than bard cap,
and you don't have to wait forever to get it.  Having run non-Vah bards,
the low levels you'll find it very easy to kill yourself just selo-running
across
terrain!

The illusion DE mask out of LGuk is relatively easy to get even at low
levels, as its a no drop that is rogue/bard only, and the assasin is
camped for his rare drop, the SBD.  While I initially thought this
would be something I wouldn't bother with, I eventually realized
that DE are -much- smaller than Vah... in tight spots in dungeons,
its just the thing.  Unfortunately places like FV may find you
KOS as a DE... so I'm looking forward to getting a illusion
Halfelf mask for such occaisions.
