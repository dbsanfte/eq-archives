Gonna have to throw a flag on the play :-)

The "internet bubble" resulted in the over-valuing and over staffing
of IT jobs as well as stock values. When people realized that pop-up
and banner adds didn't generate the revenues expected, and that online
businesses couldn't meet the projected earnings the bubble burst. Most
of the IT jobs (and job holders) that got axed only existed because of
the false conditions created by the bubble.
