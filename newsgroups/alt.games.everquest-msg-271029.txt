This is in response to the other comments too. Thanks for your input
and observations.

I understand about ordering a pet to attack something that is too far
away (having done that on occasion) however that is not what happened
in this case (though fubared pathing from pet to MOB is a possibility).
In both cases the targetted MOB was in the immediate vicinity, like
attacking others in the group in a room, and the pet was located
virtually in the middle of the melee.

QA would go out of their minds trying to replicate something like this
without better data. I don't envy them on this rare glitch.

I speculate that due to the situation, somehow the location info of the
targetted MOB got glitched so that the pet thought it was beyond the
normal engagement range. The pet would respond with attacking, but do
nothing because the MOB is too far away, according to the glitched
location info. Eventually, the game updates the location info and the
pet goes, "Hey the MOB is now in range" and moves to attack.

Since I use "/pet backoff" often (and might have done it in this case
to get the pet to switch targets) I emptied the pet hate list, gave it
a MOB to attack (and the glitched location data said it was too far
away to attack). Hence it would not attack anything else.

This would mostly account for the sketchily observed actions and
responses by attributing one probably rare problem.

I have noticed on PoK that sometimes the pet sticks in a location even
when it is in follow mode. Have to tell it to follow again to get it
unstuck. I wonder if something similar happened in PoJ and other areas.
