/ignore

It's the only way, really.

The OOC channel, many will tell you, is for out of character
conversation, and to a point this is correct. But it is not intended
as a general-purpose chatroom, but rather as a place to *briefly*
exchange OOC information that is still game related. In other words,
it's not there so you can blather about which WWF fatboy is a better
wrestler.

Still, no matter what, some morons will insist on mis-using the
channel. The only reasonable and sure avenue open to you is to
recognize that they're idiots, and put them on /ignore.
