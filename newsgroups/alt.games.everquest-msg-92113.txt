HTML is the language of the web, and it's a good language for that
purpose. 

However, this is Usenet, not the web. Here, the technical goal is
communication to the largest possible audience. The Usenet standards
call for plain text only, which is a format *everyone* can read,
whereas HTML can only be read by certain programs that ignore the
standards.

Anyone who is using a "true" (perhaps not the best word, but it'll do)
Usenet newsreading program, one that was designed to follow the
standards.

Remember, not everyone is using a graphic-based system like Mac or
Windows - some are using text-based applications at Unix prompts, and
so on.

>The FAQ would be so much easier to post/use

Easier to post? No, not really. Easier to use? Perhaps easier to
*look* at with bold headers and multiple colors and such, but people
using standard Usenet software will see gibberish. 

>2. Through Google one can read HTML.

Google is not a Usenet reader - it is a web service that archives
Usenet posts. Big difference.

>3. Through Netscape, Outlook Express, and the old Internet
>Mail Program can read HTML posts.

Only because they ignore the standards. A lot of companies got so
caught up in "webifying" things, or trying to keep up with the
competition, that they forgot how things actually work.
