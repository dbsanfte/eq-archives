/agree

I once installed a SCSI card in my PC and it acted exactly like that. I 
was able to determine for certain that it was a problem with an 
overloaded power supply by plugging a second computer in right next to it 
and powering my CD ROM and floppy drives off of power leads coming from 
the second PC. It worked fine that way, so I just had to choose between 
keeping the siamese twin PC configuration or buy a new power supply 
and/or case.  :)
