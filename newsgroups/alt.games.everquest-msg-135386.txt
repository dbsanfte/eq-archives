 Hi...

I guess u have been talking about this many times before, but I am new to
the game so here goes. When the servers are down so often will I get some of
the lost playing time that i have paid for back, or is it just too bad? When
I dont deliver what my customers have paid for they expect some sort of
refund, dosnï¿½t that apply to Verant/Sony. As i see it they owe me atleast 24
hours. Seems that their policy is pay up, then we might deliver. It isn't
that I'm cheap, I just want what i paid for.

    Regards Claus Lund
