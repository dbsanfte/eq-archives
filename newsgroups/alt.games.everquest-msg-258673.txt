Hmm, this implies that you don't need to close the track window
in order to hit track again for a skill up.

That would mean I -could- tie it to an arrow and ignore it.

I think instead of shrinking the window, I'd drop it down to the bottom 
edge of the screen so only the top of the bar is showing, then I could 
easily drag it up if I wanted to see what was up.  I guess thats the 
same effort as drag to increase size, I just think of moving things as 
easier somehow.

Or perhaps I'd shrink it to a narrow column and put it over to one side, 
still visible, where I could just glance over at it from time to time if 
interested in whats up.

Hmm, I'll have to set this up if I end up going back to the little guy.

Course I find this out -now- when he's already served his purpose (very 
nicely, tried doing his job for hours on Berserker, took 10 minutes on 
ranger)
