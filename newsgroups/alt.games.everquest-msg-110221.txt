I remember the first time I went to Velious, as a 35 magician.  The 2 of us
were both Velious virgins.. and we waited, and waited, and waited until
finally the boat came and took us there.

We zoned into ToFS, where a higher level guildie was going to show us
around.. I promptly stepped on some ice within 2 minutes of being there,
slid into the pit, and managed to gate out with 50HP left.

Was the last time I went to Velious for a while!
