You need to hit "V" to bring up alt exp screen then set the amount of exp
that gets allotted to alt advance points.  This amount (10% to 100%) will
then be awarded to AA points and NOT to leveling exp.  Some people prefer to
hit 60 before doing this, but others choose to put some points and get some
abilities as they level up.  Note : some abilites have a level requirement
to use.
