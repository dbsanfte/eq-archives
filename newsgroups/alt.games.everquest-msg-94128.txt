Yeah, including my all-time favorite (non-recreational) drug ever, 
Seldane.  I think we may still have a case or two stashed in my 
Grandfather's house (a small-town Dr. for 50 years).  Never have I found 
something that worked so damn well for such a wide range of ailments.  
Colds, flu, allergies, or what have you.  I would still use it, even 
knowing the dangers.
