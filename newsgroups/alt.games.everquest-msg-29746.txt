My shaman has been solo kiting the FM giants starting at level 27 or 28.  At
that level, just the Hillocks, at 30, 31 added in blue Tumps.  Once in a
while I find that I do have to cannibalize for some extra mana, usually,
just run, stop, nuke, run, stop, nuke.  I keep levitate and sow going, so
it's easy to take advantage of the rough terrain to get enough distance to
nuke safely.  I did have to zone once in a while due to adds, or an abnormal
number of resists/fizzles.  Never did get a Forest Loop.
