Well, despite insults from those who consider people "stupid" for making 
their choice to buy a "steaming pile of smeg", it's a pretty standard 
marketing tactic: reward those customers who are willing to share the risk 
about the quality of an untried product by giving them something of 
independently very high value to them. People are offering hundreds of 
dollars for beta accounts, while these players got theirs and are enjoying 
months and months playing EQ2 for having shelled out $30 last year for an 
RTS that doesn't provide anything remarkable other than pretty standard RTS 
play and some fun memories and associations with EverQuest, something that a 
lot of other people are willing to pay in the form of EverQuest memorabilia, 
posters, action figures, keychains and accessories, etc. /shrug
