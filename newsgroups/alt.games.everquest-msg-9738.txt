Play a necro or druid to high lvl, then sit and piss everyone off on your
server by constantly camping good items. Then create another account (new
disk needed, dont need kunark or velious) and give your farmed items to your
new mule character in a easy to get to TP zone like gfay. Then advertise
your items under the guise of selling your time on sites such as ebay or
playerauctions.com, wait for someone to bid and then pay you via paypal,
meet with his char in the game and give him the item. After you done this a
couple of times hopefully Verant will find you and delete your account. But
hey what the matter you made a few dollars and pissed everyone off in the
game that plays to enjoy the experience.

Do everyone a favour andstick to Quake or play the game for the fun
experience it is
