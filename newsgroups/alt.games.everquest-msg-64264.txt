Well, so am I, but not because I can't play, copy of Luclin in hand... it's
because I pre-ordered the damn thing over a MONTH ago and guess what???
Everyone else in the world has it BUT me. Any sign of when my copy might be
delivered? Of course not!! Called the only software place in town, Best Buy,
and they said every copy they had was gone. Dying? Hell yes!
