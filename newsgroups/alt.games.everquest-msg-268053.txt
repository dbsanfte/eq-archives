That's your problem. They do assist in the mixed room, so just stay away from
there.

Stick to the rat room and the bat room. They never assist. I still go there at
66 if I need to plow a few quick AA percentage points.

Experience at 65 was 1% regular xp or 5% AAXP per rat. Some of the rats were
even cons. At 66 it's about 1/3% regular xp and 4% AAXP per rat.

It's a perfect zone for necro aggrokiting. I target a rat from the back of the
room and pull with Embracing. There's plenty of time to FD if it resists, which
doesn't happen very often. If it sticks the there's plenty of time to cast
Funeral Pyre and then run down the hallway to the intersection leading to the
Arena. Sit, wait for the rat to get to the bottom of the stairs, cast Horror and
send (rogue) pet, then run toward the arena. Sit, wait for the rat to clear the
archway,  cast Saryrn's Kiss and run to the back wall of the Arena. Sit and wait
for the rat to get to the bottom of the stairs. FP and Horror are worn off by
now so refresh. Kite in a triangular pattern, refresh Darkness at about 50% and
FP once, the mob will turn to run at about 11% or so.

If you have DMF on you have to angle down to follow the terrain in the arena as
you run toward the back wall, otherwise the rat will warp to you.

Given the layout and the long hallways, I suspect this is also a very good zone
for fearkiting if you have chars of the appropriate level to do so. I suspect
the rats are classed as "animal" so Druids/Rangers might be able to get good
results there.
