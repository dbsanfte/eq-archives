After soloing most of the way from 34 to 51 I decided that my social skills
had suffered and that I need to start grouping more.  I decided to head to
POP when I hit 53 because I'd heard how great the exp was.  It's no
exaggeration by the way.

Got into a group in PON and we headed to our camp spot.  One the way the
cleric was having problems and needed to camp and come back to fix a bug.
We waited.  She came back, but when she zoned in she was still bugged and
got killed.  She said she was too bugged to play, so we started looking for
another cleric.  In the meantime we pulled a few and I played healer.  Tank
got a bad pull and our chanter went down like a lead balloon.

We zoned and looked for another cleric. We accidentally invited two clerics
(two different people did the inviting) and both agreed to join us. As they
were on the way our first cleric announced that her problem was fixed and
she was on the way. So we went from having no cleric to having three.  We
zoned back in and waited for the chanter to get a rezz, the original cleric
rejoined us but by this time the tank was convinced that we needed to go to
POI because the lag in PON was very bad.

Zoned into POI and pulled a few when an argument errupted between the tank
and another group member who wanted some of the drops for tinkering.  Seems
the tank wanted the cleric to have ALL the loot to pay for peridots.  We
kept telling him that the tinkering stuff was all but worthless but he just
wouldn't drop it and finally one of the players told him that if he was
going to be an ass to leave so he did.  Seems the tank and cleric were
brother/sister IRL and a few minutes later the cleric left.  Sigh

The next night

Went to POT to look for a group and hooked up with a Mage and Warrior also
looking.  We snagged a druid and monk and Ranger and headed out.  Things
were going pretty good, but after about 45 minutes the monk had to leave.
We replaced him with a Wizard and headed back in.  We got all buffed up and
ready to go and the Warrior announced that he had to go.  Druid decided to
go with him.  So we headed back to POT to look for more.  I picked up
another Warrior and druid and headed back in.  After a few pulls the Wiz
announced he had to go and the new druid needed to help out a friend.  Zoned
over to POT one more time and found an SK to help out the warrior and a
cleric to replace the druid and headed back in.  Cleric got us all buffed
and it looked good but after the first pull the cleric announced that he had
to go to rezz a guild member but he would be back.  Another pull and the
warrior had to leave and with that we gave it up.  Sigh sigh

Kinda made sitting on my butt medding sound pleasant.
