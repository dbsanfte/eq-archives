Well the combo has been pretty good so far... I just got my Heal over
time spell (takes life from me to her)... and were both pretty good
now at bind wounds...  This combo wasn't planned... I had the necro
sitting around and her warrior was moving along purty well.. so we
just decided to group.  and If I get too much aggro from the DoT's I
just FD for a little till she gets the aggro back.
