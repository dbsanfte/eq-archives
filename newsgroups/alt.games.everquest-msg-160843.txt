SF = Skyfire
SFG = Surefall Glade
BB = Butcherblock for most unless context has it clearly around Qeynos or
something. Basically, if I'm asking for a port, I know that BB is butcher
block because there is not blackburrow port, but in most other situations I
try and be specific in this case.
GF = GFay for the vast majority of peeps. Almost anyone I know with either
assume GF to equal Greater Faydark or will say "GF?". Grimling Forest = Grim
to most.

That's just my experience on Povar.
