I'm new to this group. I'm not a gamer, but I'm building a system for an
avid Luclin player. Temporarily, we're using  a system based upon a Celeron
600, 32MB TNT video card and 768MB PC133 sdram. We're on a home network with
384k SDSL. Our operating system is Windows XP Professional. {All systems use
7200RPM ATA4 or better hard drives.)

I have available a computer with 1GB PC133 sdram, of which up to 64MB can be
allocated to video. This system, which is has an ECS P6STM motherboard,
currently is running a 1.1GB Celeron. We're thinking of trying Luclin on
this system tomorrow.

That's the background, now the question: where do I go from here? I could
build a system with an Athlon XP 1800 or 1900, or I could go with an Athlon
dual 1600MP, or perhaps an Intel P4. Sdram is more cost effective, as I can
purchase 1.5GB (3x512MB) for under $200. Does Luclin support dual
processors? The information on the Everquest site doesn't seem to specify...

For video, I know I could conceivable spend in excess of $500 for a video
card, but I'd rather keep it reasonable. How about a RADEON 8500 AGP 64MB
DDR 3D/DVD 2X/4X & DVI INP  (about $250), or perhaps even a 7500 for around
one hundred dollars less?

I'm like to complete this project as cost effectively as possible. For
example, I could stick with the Celeron 600, but upgrade the CPU to a 1.1GHz
Celeron and buy a new video card. Memory on this system, which uses an Abit
BE6-II motherboard, is full at 768MB (it won't take 512MB modules).

Any Luclin players out there? All advice or guidance will be greatly
appreciated.
