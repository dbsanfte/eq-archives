I'm about a week into EQ, and I notice a lot of spellcasters offering
various spellcastings for a donation, but they don't mention how much.
I assume it's like a tip or something?  What would be an appropriate
amount min to donate for the most requested spells, like SoW, KEI, C3
(I know what SoW is, don't know the others but they're always tons of
ppl begging for them).  Would I even benefit from such spells with a
low lvl char. (around lvl 12 right now) or is it mostly a high level
thing?
