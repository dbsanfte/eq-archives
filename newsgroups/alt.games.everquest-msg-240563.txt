I just started playing a month ago myself and found it very
frustrating that there was no proper manual as well.   The one I got
on the cd was so outdate it wasnt funny and evolutions didnt have a
manual at all. GoD came with an online one that explained a few thngs
but harly put a dent in my questions.  I finally found a web page sony
puts up that has a very basic manual but it still didnt explain things
that well.  You can view it here if you wish.

The best places I found for information are these web sites. If anyone
can offer some others Id like to know as well.
