Really?  I was unaware of that, never really used the "backup" much. 
Come to think of it, though, half the time when I did, nothing would 
show up.  Probably because I'd suspended and then at some later point, 
zoned.  Mystery solved!

On the other hand, makes me feel like I wasted a lot of points getting 
the AA, since its use is much more limited than I'd thought; similar to 
the old days of pets not zoning with us.  Is suspend 2 a prereq for 
Persistant?
