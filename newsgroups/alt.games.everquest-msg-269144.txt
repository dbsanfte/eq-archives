The problem is, sometimes the client displays the mana/hp regen of a
tick prematurely - you sit, see your mana tick up, immediately cast
canni, and end up with about as much mana as before the canni,
presumably because the actual server-side tick happened later than the
client thought it did.  That happened to my shaman, anyway.  So it's
not quite as easy as just waiting for the tick being displayed.
