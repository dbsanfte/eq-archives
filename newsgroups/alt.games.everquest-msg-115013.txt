The problem is not SoW, it's the ports, which you are, frankly, a complete
newbie to, and eventually regen, which you don't yet have (since the beggars
who know what they're doing know that regen/chloro or SLN is better than
just a straight hp buff)

From level 1 to 14 I eked out a living, didn't beg, got a few things from
nice higher levels, said to myself that I'd pass it on when I was higher.
Level 14 to 29 I hunted, was happy to SoW when asked nicely, as well as an
occasional skin or STR buff, I didn't ask for money but I did accept
donations.
Level 29 to 34, I occasionally ported if someone asked, if I was
busy/oom/etc I'd say it and they'd thank me and move on, same deal with
SoW/buffs as earlier.
Level 34 to 39, I was usually 'busy' since the requests would consume all my
time, I'd SoW still with a nice request, but by 39 I didn't feel like
wasting the mana on skin/STR to beggars.
Levels 39 to 52, I've got the full suite of ports, but I rarely use them
except on friends and after a raid, I still SoW when asked nicely (and
occasionally without being asked), I nearly never skin/str/regen people who
aren't friends/guildmates/groupmates, however, I also haven't accepted money
for a port since around level 39 or so.

Also, I've rarely been anon/role, there was an RL week or so that I was
/role because some dumbass was stalking me and following me to whatever zone
I was in (apparently the wood elf breasts kept him thinking I was an RL
female...), and I'd be /role off and on back when I hunted bloodgills in
LoIO (42-46 approx) just on principle due to the lowbie concentration.

Of the non-friend/guildmate/raidmate/groupmate ports that I do, I'd say that
probably 75% of them I do for mana regen, be it bard song to full after the
port, a mod rod or couple twitches (usually regen necros anyways), or
C1/2/KEI (or even breeze), I always (try) to SoW before I port (or
afterwards if porting out of a dungeon), and I usually click my bracer of
the hidden on them just on general purposes, and I usually ask if they
need/want invis for the more dangerous ports (includes SFG and NK for evils)

I never PL, beyond dropping SLN and a SoW (and bracer clicky) on one of my
RL friend twinks when I do a gear transfer from their main;  that said, I
did let an RL friend bot my druid for about 5 hours on his second computer
to PL one of his alts once, but considering that I know the login/password
to his 52 warrior, him knowing doesn't bother me (also considering that he
forgets my password within about 3 days), I've also had him log on me to
sell stuff that I have a few times since often times I'm on the phone with
him at a time that I don't have access to the net or EQ.

Knowing where someone lives is great incentive to them to not rape your
account. (and knowing mexicans that perform cheap, if messy, hired killings)

I'm fairly sure I had a point to make when I started this post, but I don't
remember any more. (As I tell quite a few of my friends, no one would notice
if I got Alzheimer's)
