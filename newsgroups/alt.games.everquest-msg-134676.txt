Absolutely!

I've only been EQ'ing for a few months now, and my main is a L28 Cleric.
I'm there to have fun and enjoy myself, and not to just sit on my fat
ass and do nothing except HEAL, HEAL, HEAL.

Sure, my *main* function may be to heal, but if my mana is max'ed and
I can help out my group by stunning, by nuking and by whacking, then
I'll do so!

After all, stunning and nuking a critter can be looked at as simply
an alternative form of healing - the cleric is reducing the time that
a critter has to do damage to the group, and so that means you're
saving the group from taking some HP damage, meaning less healing is
needed later on. And the same goes for buffs - keep your group buffed
in advance, and its less damage they'll take during a fight and therefore
less healing that's needed later on.

Yes, I'm there to help the group, but by the same token, the cleric is
a member of the group and so everyone else in that group is there to
help the cleric!

Most clerics are able to concentrate on more than just one thing, so next
time the cleric in your group joins in a fight, don't yell at them!
Encourage them instead! :-) Our fighting skills need all the encouragement
they can get!

You know what really bugs me? When I've grouped with a particular tank
for the first time, and they refer to me as "Oi, Cleric!" Do I refer to
them as "Oi, tank!"? No! I respect them and I call them by name. So it's
nice to have the same respect in return. If I don't respect them, I degroup
from them and never group with them again. :-) Simple! But I still call
them by name!

Cheers,
Gary. :-)
