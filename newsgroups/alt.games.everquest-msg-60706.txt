I play a level 30 necro and today I've been grouped with two parties who
despite reaching level 30 or so clearly have little idea of the needs and
skills of necros in a group. Probably because necros rarely group so here
are some bits of advice :-

Unless I tell you I need it, don't waste your mana healing me. If I need
health during a fight I'll lifetap it fom one of the mobs, doing them some
damage at the same time. It's normal for necros to end the fight on more
health than they started and the lose health while meditating due to
vampiric curse turning those hitpoints into mana. Of course if I'm about to
die I'd welcome a heal...

Don't waste your mana giving me breeze. I'll only cancel it as vampiric
curse is better. Clarity is more debatable but I still prefer to use
vampiric curse to clarity as it seems faster. At least you *can* cancel
breeze these days. A while back you couldn't so it was a big pain.

Buff my pet, not me. I don't want to get involved in the fight, but my pet
will. I see too many people buffing the necro and forgetting the pet.  BUT
if you have any health regeration buffs, I need those. I can turn them into
mana regeneration... Well, buff me if you can, it's welcome but it's not
your priority.

If you SOW the group, remember the pet. Don't want it to get left behind!

Don't expect me to be doing anything other than meditating during most of
the fight. My pet is tanking, doing reasonable damage and taking damage from
the less expendable tanks, I need the mana more than you need the extra
little but of damage I can be doing.

Treat me as any other caster. If I start getting hit, taunt the thing off me
as I'll die rapidly. If I die you lose my pet as well so that's like two
deaths.

Allow me to pull with boil blood when appropriate. This DOT spell does a
whole lot of damage over time. If I pull with it it gets two or more chances
to reduce the health of the mob before it even gets to the tank.

Learn what necros can do for you. For example fear can be a very powerful
alternative to enchanters mez spells. If an extra mob joins in the fight, I
can fear it and it will run off for 20 seconds or so giving the group time
to finish off the first mob. But sometimes I need to be asked to do this as
it's not always clear to casters if the tanks think they can hold off the
mobs.

Ask for nukes. We don't have nukes quite as powerful as some of the other
classes, but shock of poison does 160 damage at level 30 which is a fairly
good nuke if you don't have a wizard handy.

Assume that we even though we stand up at the start of a fight, cast two
spells and sit down for the rest of the fight that we are doing our jobs.
With the pet, and all our dots running we are probably doing far more damage
to the mob that all of the tanks combined, but nobody can see that so it
often looks like we are just sitting the fight out. Also we can can heal a
bit, nuke reasonably well and fear.

I think that necros are often overlooked for groups because to people who
don't play necros it looks like we are adding little to the group when in
fact we are doing a huge amount of damage and have some utility spells like
a mana efficient heal over time spell which can keep a tank health long term
unlike the one off heals of a cleric. (Not that I'm suggesting we can
replace a cleric, but we can take some of the healing pressure off them if
we have the spare mana).

These are aimed at big groups. In partnerships or small groups, things are
slightly different.

Anyway, lecture over. Has anyone got anything to add to this? How do other
classes find grouping with necros? Is there anything I should be doing that
I don't due to ignorance of what other classes can do?
