Note that the Gate to Bind potions are made of 3 Heliotrope (approx 240pp).
My guess is that they will trivial around 170, like the other Gate options.
It will be nice for EverQuest players to finally have a reliable, non-LORE
set of multiple Gate points and that Alchemists will be able to provide
these. This alone will make Alchemy useful and my profession worth the time
and money that I have put into it.

Note also the illusion potions (fun!) and Group shrink. Amazing...
