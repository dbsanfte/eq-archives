You aren't getting an argument from me that running your monitor at 60Hz 
is ideal. You are getting an argument from me that the average person 
runs their monitor at the default, which is IME 60Hz.

I personally spend all day staring at screens for work, and I have 
noticed reduced eye strain from high quality monitors set with higher 
refresh rates. I am a big advocate of higher refresh rates.

But the bottom line is that the average users experience is capped 
around 60fps regardless of their video card.
