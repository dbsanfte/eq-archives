Most people consider giving a character anything he didn't earn
himself (either through saving to buy or directly giving cash/items),
no matter how minor, to be twinking. But, as you said, it doesn't
really matter in the grand scheme of things. It's so rare to find an
untwinked character anymore. I can't recall the last time I saw a
plate-wearing class, no matter how low level, dressed in anything less
than plate unless they either were just created a few minutes ago or
were on a CR (level 11+).
