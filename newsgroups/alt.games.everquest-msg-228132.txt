That was true for a while but its been changing, at least on Saryrn. In
recent weeks I've done pet-tank groups, groups without any mez/lull capacity
at all, all sorts of lineups....the other day I had a group where the only
melees were me and two rogues (we had the cleric pacify and I pulled with
slow, it worked okay and we got the win). On the one hand players have
gotten more familiar and hence comfortable with LDoN dungeons, and on the
other you don't have folks trying to protect perfect won-loss records like
during those first few weeks. There's also less tolerance now of spending
tons of time forming a group than when LDoN first rolled out.

Its often commented that LDoN adventuring "exposes" players who previously
"never really had to learn how to play their class." There's truth in
that -- I know I never felt the need to maintain a "never to be grouped with
again" list before LDoN. One nice side effect is players learning that
comfort with your groupmates is more important to your chances of success
than a perfect class lineup. I've learned this the hard way and I can see
that others have too. Hence I more often now end up in groups that have two
tanks and no mezzer, or two druids and no cleric, or whatever -- cause we're
better off grouping 6 people who we know can play and then figuring out how
to beat the dungeon with that particular lineup.
