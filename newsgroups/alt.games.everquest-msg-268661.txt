While in Everquest 2, warriors can only solo to 50.  Or 19, since at
20 you become either a guardian or berserker.  World of Warcraft is
clearly the superior game.

Oh, they get abilities in EQ2, too, but they're probably far inferior
to what you get in World of Warcraft, since we all know that's the
better game.
