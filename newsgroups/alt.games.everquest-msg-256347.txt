They might con light blue to Grage if he goes in a duo with the
enchanter, since their level is probably based on your average.
My wizard went there with a BST who was 2 levels higher than me
(both in our late teens) and I think after he dinged there he
said some of the mobs even turned green.

Also there's a third room that has both rats and bats; it's found
via a side passage off a corridor, easy to miss if you don't have
a map.  (I don't know if any of the map sites cover this zone.)
