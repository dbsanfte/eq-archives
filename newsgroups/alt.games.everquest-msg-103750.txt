I think everyone has. That's why so many of us shudder at the memory.

Seriously I don't say never go I just say go knowing you'll be
grouping with in general the lowest average skill and maturity level
in Norrath. These are the enchanters that are nuking not mezzing, the
casters who don't know what assist is, the clerics standing there
meleeing then going "oom need to med"....

My favorite was the last time I was there. Mr druid (typical, eh), the
party's only healer, is having a great old time dotting mobs. He
doesn't care which mob he dots, he's got creeping crud and by god he's
going to USE it no matter how much more valuable his mana would be
healing. No idea what assist is, so of course he never dots the right
one, and no mezzing a dotted mob. Then he runs around as the pissed
sarnak beats the snot out of him until I root it. At which point he
brings out careless lightning. After he did this twice I told him to
unmem his dot. He did, for a few pulls, then did it again. I
disbanded. And watched the group pull one sarnak for every four the
far group killed for a few minutes before gating and laughing to
myself.

I don't put up with that kind of idiocy for long. Someone doesn't
assist once, I just remind them to assist. Do it again, and I ask if
they know what assist is (quite a large number don't). After that, if
they do it a third time, I warn them if they can't assist I'll be
disbanding. Fourth time, as soon as the fight is over, goodbye. Then
ten minutes later watch as the group's exp rate drops to nothing as
they're forced to med and heal for five minutes after every multiple
pull.

I'm used to good players. This newbie crap gets on my nerves in a big
hurry.
