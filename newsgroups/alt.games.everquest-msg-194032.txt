Enchanter slows are already only marginally worse than shaman slows,
at least where it counts (difference of 5% on the highest and second
highest slows, though enchanters have to wait five extra
levels). There really isn't much room for anything in between shaman
and enchanter slows; what might make sense is disease resist slow for
druids, for use on mobs which are hard to slow with magic resist slow.
