Your best bet is to do a /who all 60 enchanter on your server, and send a
tell to one that's not in an obvious high level hunting zone, one in EC/
Gfay/ NFP (whichever is your server's prime auction zone) or ThurgadinA is
probably least likely to be busy, if they are, just apologize and move on to
the next name on the list.

Only pieces I've found to have much sale value are 6ac/65hp rings, any BD or
Diamond stuff usually, 7 wis rings, 5int rings, hp/mana necks and ears,
str/wis veils and str/int necks.  Although taking special orders on a set of
cha gear doesn't hurt to be able to do.

Note though, at 199 you aren't going to want to try Velium BD or Diamond
combines, and you should probably not bother doing plat BD/diamond either.
