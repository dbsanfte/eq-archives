Please.  -Don't- think about that too hard.  I wouldn't want your universe

Luckily, this concept is easily testable.  I don't suppose you'd want to 
try it, though, would you?  Because until you do... your belief that the 
world will not disappear at the moment of your untimely demise is merely 
an article of faith.

Don't even have to go that far.  In a ring of modulus 3, 2+2=1.

Ah, a standard tactic.  Anyone you disagree with, or see the world in a 
different way from, has "obvious mental problems".  Not clever, I'm 
afraid.

Free Mumia!

Shoulda briefed Dahmer on that rule.  Or the Donner Party...

}They will however eat their enemies. Because they

}Their actions are not evil as defined by them as you say.
}However, that does not change the fact that their actions are
}evil. Since if a rival tribe were to capture and eat some of their

How do you know they're people?  How do you know they would consider the 
second part evil, and not just 'the way things are'?

}In their heart-of-hearts and intellectually deep down people

Good to know you can see into the heart-of-hearts of all men, to check 
that what they know is everywhere the same.
