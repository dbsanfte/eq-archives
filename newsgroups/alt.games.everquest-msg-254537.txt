I mainly have LED fans. I have a red fan with a dragon plate over it on
the side of my computer, and two blue LED fans inside (one in front and 
one in the back). There's also a blue light, but I never turn it on 
(it came with the case).

Side note: LED fans can be useful. My power supply fan started dying
on me, so I replaced it with a blue LED fan. This gives the case a 
VERY cool glow from the back, but - if the new power supply fan should
ever go out and do so quietly - I can also tell the fan is slowing down
because of how the glow changes.
