Don't forget that all this is ultimately at the discretion of the server 
GM. The guidelines are just that, guidelines to help you avoid choosing a 
bad name. Of course, if you are hell-bent on it, you can choose a name 
that will obviously get you banned and yet appears to superficially 
comply with the guidelines.

In my humble opinion, anybody who would choose "Osama" as their character 
name ought to be banned the earlier the better. If they get banned even 
before they have time to create one single character, well, no objections 
from me.
