In fact Aruvqan was the one called for top posting not me .. get your facts
right.  I posted on the basis that this was the only group I subscribe to
that insists on people bottom posting and pointing it out to them .. I then
said that if it bothered people they should just place top posters on
/ignore

Pedants and people who do not know how to use the English language (if that
is the language in common use .. I can do without them.

Hard to lose when I have /ignored a lot of whining little children who
cannot pose a cognitive and well thought out argument. Thye also have to
resort to cursing when they are proved wrong .. just shows how wrong they
can be rather than using normal language to sort it out.

I don't doubt she is more articulate than you .. so far many errors of fact
in your post.
