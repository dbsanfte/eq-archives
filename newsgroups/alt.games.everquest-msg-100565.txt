Oh... Let's not forget a few other things along with Customer Service...
The level of intelligence of the customer in question and the way the
customer treats the customer service rep as their kicking horse when things
go wrong and expect things to work automagically.

One of the other fun things about Customer Service is definitely the level
of intelligence of the customer.  It is fun to listen to them tell you your
job as if they know what you can and cannot do, despite the big leap of
logic of what is involved to fix it.  A lot of the griping I have heard of
late is having patches working right.  If programming was simple, I don't
see why the complainers haven't bothered to put in their money where their m
outh is.  I mean, come on people...  You are paying $10 a month, and believe
that Verant has the money to get things right...  Yet don't know the costs
of running a company, the programming aspects, and still expect human beings
to be perfect in one day.

I mean, come on people...  As EQ shaman has said... Become a guide...  Let's
see your convictions come into play now and see if you can fix the things
you gripe about over and over again.  Sure, you don't get paid to be a Guide
except maybe a free Account, but oh, wait...  There is actually something
outlining what a Guide and GM can do...  Oh, there is even a policy...
Amazing how many people read those things, probably not a lot when you watch
people pitch fits here and in the chat room.

Easier to critize a company for not following through on what you believe
them to do, versus what you can actually do...  Almost like that other
addage: "Those who can't do...  Teach."
