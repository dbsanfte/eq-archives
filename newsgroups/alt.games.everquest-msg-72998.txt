Actually you can take down VS with 2 groups. I have always done VS with 2 groups.

4 warriors
1 cleric
2 rogues
3 wizards
1 ranger

This is how my guild did it all the time

The main boss is Venril Sathir and I've never seem him taken down
without at least 3 groups. A single level 60 wizard would get eaten so
fast he'd give VS heartburn.

Whoever this was, he clearly didn't play any character to 60 or he'd
know better.
