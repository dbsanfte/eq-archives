I have a question.

In the Tower of Frozen Shadow, there are spots where if you fear a mob they
will just run into a corner and keep running until either they die or the
fear wears off.  Would you consider that an exploit of pathing?  True, it
would be harder if we had to snare them so that the pets could keep up and
kill them (and avoid adds), but its the Fear spell that is keeping us from
harm.

So, in one light it looks like an exploit of pathing, on the other it looks
like good tactics (fear-kiting) where the terrain/pathing just makes the
tactics more effective.
