15% better at avoiding getting  hit isn't the kind of "very well
indeed" that you'd need to show me to compensate for Stoicism
(and later Torpor).

Casting without getting interrupted by a single slowed mob is
also a nearly trivial exercise for a shaman, again, I spent 90%
of my shaman's operating life being beat on while chain casting
canni any time I wasn't casting something else instead.  Being
interrupted by melee doesn't cost any mana or time, you just
restart the cast, most shaman spells cast fairly quickly and
slowed mobs seem to suck at stopping them.

Now that might change radically in POP, I played there in groups
but didn't solo at only 52, on the other hand my bard and cleric
both observed group mate shaman off tanking mobs while grouped,
and soloing, both in POV and POS and in BOT using the same "mob
hits the shaman, pet hits the mob" technique, so I bet it doesnt'
really change much.

Aye, its  unwise to use it on someone who's trying to do any real
damage, but its precisely the fact that shaman can suck up damage
without pretending to really deal any that makes them such good
tanks; they can keep it on constantly without negative impact on
the fight.  And if they aren't taking enough damage to keep it
from putting them at FHP, they can always canni more.

I used to see this sort of thing all the time with those rare
shaman who were level 60 and had Torpor, one of the best things
about LOY was giving a Torpor style spell to the level 44 shaman,
allowing him to play his class before hitting the high end of the
game.

Shaman shouldn't be thought of as  a "caster" in this
description, though, lots of HP, decent AC, and the
stoicism/torpor factor can't be overstated for effect if you
aren't trying to actually damage the mob you are tanking... I
suppose there's a gap in the upper 50s where stoicism stops being
good enough to make any difference versus POP mob DPS, but I
can't imagine a rogue is going to be a happy little tank if a
shaman -with- stoicism is still suffering.  

Particularly a shaman thats been deliberately chosen as
complement to a rogue, which means the shaman in question has
gone out of his way to get HP gear (always sensible for a shaman
anyway) and AC gear (which many grouping shaman will ignore in
favor of Wis gear, Ghue knows why)
