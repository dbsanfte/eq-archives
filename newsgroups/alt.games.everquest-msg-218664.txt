Yep same here mostly.  And I always bug out of a conversation when it's 
getting hard to read because of a combination of posting styles or a 
persistent top-posting style.

As someone else rightly said, it's an information overloaded world - I 
self select posts that are easy to read, and that means well structured, 
well punctuated (probably directly related) and well written.  Any post 
where the layout prevents me getting to the content is just skipped. 
People can post however the hell they want, in any combination of 
styles, shortcuts and bastardised languages, but I don't need to read 
them if it's not worth the effort.
