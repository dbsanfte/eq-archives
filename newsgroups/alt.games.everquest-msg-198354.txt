Or, if your supposition is correct, they'll show that the "average"
PAL twink is a dwarf twinked by a fucking moron.

Serp Bracers, painfully stupid.  Add Cracked Darkwood Shield instead
of Sarnak Battle Shield and proc-less Ghoulbane instead of MoSS and
you might as well have spotted the SK 2 or 3 levels.

Yes, and SBS typically sells for more than the total value of the
PAL kit.  Either they summoned Brad back to fuck with anybody who
dares to test a PAL for them or they chose a drooling idiot to
set up the kit.

Sure, but they give the Enchanter stupid gear also (not all that much
INT) while giving the Necro plenty of INT.  Face it, the person or
team that put these kits together either enjoys fucking with people
or is selectively ignorant about the game (probably both).

That's why they gave PAL an ac8 belt, right?

Why does a Paladin have TWO Extended Affliction 2 items?

Note how the dual wield classes are getting better 1h weapons than
the Paladin, contrary to the spread of actual items in game?

I only looked at Paladin and Enchanter in-game, neither was close in
quality to what I've seen reported for Rogue and SK.  And WTF is with
the anti-Human/Erudite/Barb attitude of no light sources at all in
the gear (Paladin had a Splitpaw Mask without the light!).

My prediction:  By next year there will be only 4 races in EQ:  Iksar,
Vah Shir, Frogluk, and of course the rulers of Norrath, the Halflings.
