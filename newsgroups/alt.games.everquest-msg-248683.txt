}Yes, I was thinking of my cleric.  But according to Allakhazams they are
}required 65.  The druid ones didn't show the level.....

That was probably the Elemental armor, rather than the Ornate.  I know the 
Ornate armor has no required level... My 39 Enchanter on Firiona Vie is 
bedecked with the Silken Augmenter's Sleeves.  I'd have to go check if 
there's a recommended level, but I don't think so.

                    Ornate       Elemental    
Pattern is:         droppable    no drop
Required level:     no.          65
Level for combine:  55           ?

It has been suggested that it may be a Tier 3 flag requirement rather than 
a level requirement... so perhaps you can get the item at 46 if you can 
get flagged for BoT.  But I wouldn't know for sure. :)

I've also heard rumors there are patterns and molds and such for Time 
class armor.  Anyone know anything about that?
