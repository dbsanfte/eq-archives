    You split them? :-) Mind you, you "solo" the tents so that could explain
why you split them. I'm usually there in a group that can mez 'em.

    Did a bit of reading - any Sentinel spawn point can pop either Kerdelb
or Bledrek, named Sentinels. I'll use Bledrek as the example. He hits in the
low 400's, level 58 mob, disease slowable. He'll drop BP gems and the level
55 Velious spells on occasion. When he dies Bled will spawn - summons (so 51
plus), but slowable and much easier. The real loot drops off Bled - either
Blood Runed Greaves, Barbed Ringmail Leggings or Barbed Ringmail Sleeves.
Kerdelb is the same deal, drops Barbed Ringmail,  Barbed Ringmail Sleeves
and Blood Runed Gauntlets.

    See above, and blue (heh heh heh). They aren't easy like that named
gargoyle (whoops, named human) is up there, though.

    You can actually see what Sentinels are up from the ramps. Used that
once to tell a Velk raid Kerdelb was up.
