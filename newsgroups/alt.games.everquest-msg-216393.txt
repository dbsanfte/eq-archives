    Or a GM that didn't want to watch two bards go running around doing
jack-squat to each other for the next five hours. The same rule was applied
in the bard BotB, for the same reason. Sucks if you're a caster, but most
Royal Rumble events aren't caster friendly to begin with. Now what would
have been funny is if a necromancer liched, invised, and then feigned, only
standing up to finish someone off with a lifetap or renew invis. With how
hard skeletons are to target now, I bet they could have found a very nice
hiding spot and lasted until only a few people were left.
