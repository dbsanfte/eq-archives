Much to my magician's dismay, its impossible to bind wounds on your pet; this is
worse news for me than it is for an SK, because my pet takes a lot of damage and
I rarely take any, unless things are going badly wrong, and then I don't need a
way to heal up, I need a rez, because Mages aren't at all good at getting out of
badly wrong situations.
