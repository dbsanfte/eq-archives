Ok - here's a long URL (I was trying to find Rob's post on Gamesh)
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-
8&q=Gamesh+Winterfury&btnG=Google+Search&meta=group%3Dalt.games.everquest.*

Make a shorter link gives:
http://makeashorterlink.com/?L3AB42787

Assume for a minute that they keep a simple database with
a table with 2 columns - key, url.
key is alphanumeric, unique and 9 characters wide.
Url is probably text, I don't know the max size.

If they are only using caps and numbers (like the example)
then that gives them 36^9 = 1 x 10^14 entries, or 100
trillion entries.

If they expand it to include lowercase it becomes 62^9 or
1.35 x 10^16 or, well, a lot :), 13,500 trillion (what's
the term for the 1000's place past trillion?  Can't
remember, low blood sugar and dinner's done :) ).

I will NEVER claim that you can't fill an address range
(640k anyone?  10^7 phone numbers in a state like OR,
2^32 IP addresses, etc).  However, it does seem like it
will last them a while.
