Well it seemed to me to show at about the time people in Europe and the UK
got home, ate food and then settled to hit their addiction solidly for th
first time in a couple of days after the move had been done and the
patch....I tried 3 characters and a total of about 8 zones...all were a
lot morepopulated than I would have expected even for an established
server like the one I had come from and way way over the top for what I
was used to on AB prior tot he movelog.

A system wide message was announced about just gone 6pm UK time that there
was heavy lag, mostly Germans complaining and they were looking into it.
I assume they may have done something...
