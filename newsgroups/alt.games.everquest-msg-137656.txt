Please, please...unless you're wearing a Fungi and have
some 13/20+ weapons, don't think of soloing as a rogue.

Seriously.  A rogue CAN solo, even at level 60.  The difference
is downtime.  Unless you have a way to deal major damage
AND a way to speed up your healing, it's just not worth the
time.

I mean it.  A warrior can solo certain mobs pre-50 by binding
wounds to 50% and then going after another.  A monk can do
the same, AND just FD if the fight doesn't go well...not to
mention mend recycling every once in a while.

A rogue can't.  We don't have the hps/ac to last in a toe-to-toe
fight UNLESS you start at 95-100% health.  And that's against
a low blue.  From level 20 through 60.  And I mean that.  At
54 my alt rogue (who solos with her epic and a 14/25 slasher,
as well as a 100pt per 6 seconds healing bp/DS ring and belt),
she was still looking ONLY for level 39-41 mobs.  Anything level
38 was light blue (not worth the time), and anything level 42+
was going to eat me unless I lucked out on a 450+ backstab
to start the fight.  And that's all only if you can fight away from
wanderers.  I mean it:

IF YOU CANNOT HEAL YOURSELF AND CANNOT HAVE
MAJOR WEAPONRY ALREADY, DON'T TRY TO SOLO WITH
A ROGUE.

Here's how soloing with my rogue went pre-Kunark (before
I had any money or brains):

Nobody grouped with rogues, except personal RL friends ;-).
I could go into the maze at Cazic Thule, and hunt for 10 minutes
to find a single blue-to-me lizard sentinal.  Skulk around him
until he finally lost his friends AND was close to the doorway.

Backstab (usually for 7 points ;-)  ), drag him outside, and hope
I didn't bring even a single green warder with him.  If so, I had
to zone.  If not, I could take him down with a 2 minute fight.

Afterwards, bind wound to 50%.  Then sit for 6+ minutes healing
through natural means to 100%.

Repeat.

This was with some rubicite/Ravenscale and dual 8/27 weapons.
And if those weapons didn't proc a snare, I probably would have
died a lot more than I did...
;-)
