Hello all,

I have a friend who's currently playing on a  AMD K6 2 500, 320Mb RAM with
an onboard 8Mb graphics card. I think it runs like a 1920's movie but he
says it's playable... I plan to get him upgraded as soon as I have 5 minutes
free and he's got the cash.

He's got all the expansions (except LoY since it's a download) but has only
installed Kunark and Velious due to system requirements for Luclin.

Quetion is: can he install PoP or LoY before upgrading? Is it only the new
Luclin stuff that requires the better specs?

I let him play on my machine when I'm away so I haven't upgraded yet either.
Can someone with a non-Luclin account play on a machine that has Luclin
installed? I don't think so but would like that confirmed...

(I have no probs upgrading since I'm on a 1.7GHz with 512Mb RAM and 32Mb
GeForce2.)

Thank you for any and all advice,


Calmac
