A lovely attempt to pat yourself on the back there and declare some sort
of "victory" in a debate on opinions, (others backing off) but like a
poor marksman, you again miss the target entirely. I've seen none of
these people saying "Oh, I see. You're right, Ben." No. It looks far
more like, having stated their opinions and answered your questions only
to have you ignore the answers and continue your parrot-like line of
"I'm still waiting", they simply gave up on the discussion as pointless.
That, or perhaps they get less enjoyment than I out of Usenet debate on
topics of interest in general, or in specific, watching you chase your
own tail on this and continue to contradict yourself. :-)

As stated, both I and others *have* provided answers. But having a few
spare minutes waiting for our servers to restart, I suppose I'll hammer
out the same answers again, though sadly it will likely just be so you
can snip them and pretend they weren't given, since they dont' support
your *opinions*.

<SOME> of the changes are bad. Others, as always, are great. Three of
the big bones of contention here seem to be the spell book removal, the
complete erasure of any challenge to get to level 11, and the removal of
the hell levels. These are all things that make the game harder, as I,
and others, think it should be to keep it as appealing and addicting as
it is. 

To the first question, *YOU* have already <admitted> that having the
book makes it harder for casters, though we disagree on how *much*
harder. You say little, I say quite a bit. The spell book issue also
falls under the category of "rites of passage". You disagree, but you
*HAVE* been answered. I look forward greatly to getting casters to level
35 to lose that spell book. It's an accomplishment. You can keep asking
until the cows come home... how was it that you keep tediously repeating
that question to deflect attention away from the answer that was already
given... oh yes... "I don't understand how anyone can ENJOY the
stupidest mistake VI ever put in the game or enjoy starting at a spell
book."  We don't. That's why it's hard. That's why its' a "rite of
passage" to get rid of it. Hello? Is this on?

Second, we have the total "dumbing down" of the first ten levels. You
like it. Fine. I don't. You asked why. You were told. There is, IMO, a
big learning curve in the first ten levels about managing your location,
corpse recovery, death penalties, protection of your gear, etc. You feel
these lessons are apparently worthless and can be learned exactly the
same after they reach eleven, even though they will learn them further
from home and in potentially MUCH harder places (early dungeons) than
learning them in EC. We disagree, but your answer, again, HAS been given
repeatedly. You just don't like/agree with it.

The last issue is the hell levels. You can drone on all day long about
how it was "not even wanted by Verant" and "a bug", blah, blah, blah.
But you asked why and were answered mutliple times. Over time it became
part of the fabric of the game and how people progress through it. It
has evolved into a rite of passage with its own rewards. Yes, many
people stop playing a character, or the game entirely, when they hit the
hell levels because it's "too hard". I think it's "hard enough". Have I
FINALLY _re_given the answers to your oh so important questions in a way
that you can understand them on this, and stop saying "I'm still
waiting"? Or shall you chase your tail a bit more. You must be getting
dizzy by now.

Well, on to the specifics...

Yes, I still see you that way, but it's an opinion, and you're entitled
to it.

Again with the "dodge" thing when your question was CLEARLY answered.
You just don't care for the answer. If you want to hang on to some claim
that you have some magic line drawn as to what is "too easy" and "not
too easy" you'll be the one needing to provide backing hard evidence as
to how you arrived at that line.

Yet again, you ask a question. You get an answer. You respond with the
oh so witty and point-making "who cares" and move on pretending you
received no answer.

> Does it being a hindrance somehow make it a good thing?

Further down you will make reference to night blindness, infravision,
etc. They are also "hindrances". In Ben'sVision (tm) shall we just give
every race ultravision and a soulbound high powered light source because
night blindness is "too hard"? Some hindrances make the game harder, and
thus more of a challenge. Was that in short enough words to qualify as
an "answer" for you?

They *do* have infravision and ultravision and obtainable light sources,
so you have no point here. Some races have vision trouble. They must
overcome that challenge. Part of the game, even if it's too hard for
you. Do you just not play nightblind races because it's "too hard"?

*sigh*. And you shall remain waiting until everyone, including me, gets
bored with your circular argument and denial that you've received
answers. Making the game easier dumbs it down. The degree you do it to
will determine how much it get's dumbed down. These three changes
discussed above, to me, are too much dumbing down already. Others here
have found them "acceptable" but worry (and rightfully so) that the
follow a recent trend of VI catering to the whiners and dumbing down
more and more stuff. All valid opinions. All answers to your questions.
Again, you just don't like the answers. And even the ones worrying about
what this portends as a trend are, IMO, fully valid in that concern even
if they are not totally alarmed by these specific changes. Those are
valid, opinion based answers. But instead of at least acknowledging that
you received and answer, we get "Chicken little I'm still waiting blah
blah blah blah blah".

Again, please support this with fact, at least in terms of "Verant
doesn't want" it. Originally it was in the game all the way to fifty,
right? (No, I don't know that for sure myself. I've only been playing
about 18 months. And yes, yes, yes, I know... when "you were my age" you
walked uphill to school both ways barefoot in the snow and had to kill
grizzly bears with your looseleaf notebook on the way each day.) 

Then, at some point, VI showed they were obviously capable of removing
the damn book, because they removed it for 35 to 50 (and then 60). But
it was still there for the low levels.  Please show us again how VI has
never wanted it. And I dont' mean *TODAY'S* VI team. I mean the old
team. Remember them? The one's with TheVision (tm)? How is is just being
removed now, unless it's only to cater to the LCD and accomodate the
whiners?

To quote a famous Usenet debater, "I'm still waiting."

Since I'm not the only person, even in this limited player sampling
present in this forum, that argued against removing it, your statement
of "the players don't want it" is obviously a generalization to support
*your* opinion and, if I may quote that same famous debater, "100%
horseshit". You dont' want it. Many others don't either. But don't speak
for all of us, Ben. We didn't elect you to do so. As to "the company
doesn't want it." well, as above..... "I'm still waiting."

> Out of curiosity, what level and class is your character? Will this

How that applies to this debate of opinion is beyond me, but I have no
problem answering. I also fail to see what server either of us plays on
affects it, as my understanding of the patch is that it will affect all
servers. But anyway... my three casters that I play are all mid twenties
to low thirties (wizard, chanter, necro) and all still have the book. So
for them, the book change as well as the hell level changes affect them.
And I still oppose them. My highest melee (warrior) is two blue bubbles
short of 56, so only has one true "hell level" to go and will be
unaffected. My newest pet melee just dinged 19 and has *all* the hell
levels in front of him, so will be affected.

There, once again you asked a question (for whatever reason) and again I
answered. Why do you ask, if I may inquire?
