Thats not quite what hes talking about. I experienced the same problem with
my beastlord in the Dreadlands a few times over the weekend. Mow and I would
get a mob to the "Running away" state, and he would take 3-4 steps, and then
vanish. In actuality the mobs at the other end of the zone, still running
away ( although since Im Kunark, it forgets its Aggro ).

Very annoying to have an almost dead mob vanish on you and you get no Exp
for it...
