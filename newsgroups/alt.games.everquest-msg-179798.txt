primal avatar is nice, no components needed :)
Of course if i ever get ferine, that will blow it away!

The warrior isnt in raid gear though, I think that will be the limiting
factor in what we can kill (compared to say, the guild MA with almost 10k
hp)

I see the bricks..  the talon only drops in the caves tho, right?
That place is so damn overcamped, I've been there once ever.

I have 145 smithing - that good enough for the combine?  And finding a GM
jeweller shouldnt be too hard. i think

Can the liquid and talon poof if the combine fails?  I have 2 talons and 2
liquids atm..  1 I should really give to my shaman though

What are the combines and trivs?  My smithing kinda sucks, but my girlf is
GM in brewing
Who drops the blood?

SBC is way overpriced for what shitty haste it has.
Maelstrom.. hmm maybe I'll go drop Dlammaz and get 1, what about PoP options
tho?
