The real deal here is that you got absolutely caught posting as your own
daughter. This is the same nic that you have accused others of using to attack
you and your family. How pathetically low can a scumbag sink?  If a daddy
attacks his own daughter here in order to get sympathy I think he would also
sexually abuse her.  I used to actually believe that some low life was writing
shit about you kids and I have condemned it before. What a shock to have
evidence that it was you all the time. You're one sick pervert that's not worth
the air you use to stay alive.
