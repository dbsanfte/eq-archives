I'm thinking black plate would be pretty expensive (I once paid 200
for a BP and then 150 extra to have it dyed black) so black iron armor
would be the best option in that vein.
If you'er willing to deviate from the black look and everyone has
Velious graphics, I'd try getting a set of tizmak armor. It's purple
on male halflings, and the tunic has a collar look to it.
