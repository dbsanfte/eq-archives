Well, recovery for a mage is barely longer than the rez effects.
I can go from just rezzed to full mana, geared up pet, Xegony's
Phantasmal protection (6mana per tick) and Arcane shielding in
less than 5 minutes.

It only requires about 4k worth of gear (Fetid Flesh Belt to make
the 49 earth pet cast in 7 seconds, enshrouded veil adds 50mana
to each reclaim.)

I've talked to mages that charm solo BoT, somedays they make huge
XP, somedays it's 5 deaths and time to call it a day.
