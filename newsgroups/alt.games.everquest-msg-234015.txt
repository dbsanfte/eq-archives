I was the cleric last night for a group of people all higher level than me.  We
had no crowd control.  Well, I take that back.  We had a ranger, a druid, a
shaman and me that all have a *root* spell, if you want to call that crowd
control.  The other two were *tanks*, tho no warrior.
First pull the guy brings 4, he doesn't announce the pull, he doesn't announce
the adds.  Somehow we manage to kill them without anyone getting dead.  So I
say "/g I would be happy to assist / pacify and I have the area of effect
pacify spell too".  No one responds.  Next pull he brings three.  
Now I'm getting a little irritable.  Once *root* wears off I'm dealing with
robes having agro.  On the 2nd set of 4, four of us die when the MT engages the
mob *way* outside of my healing range.  I guess he's never heard of *move to me
please*.   I /g that I am disbanding for a KEI since I'm already in POK, and
will be right down.  Both the MT and the druid are in the zone with me.
The druid heads off, the MT doesn't bother to run back down.  When I get back
in the dungeon he's still sitting in POK, waiting for a rez.  Well, ok, there
goes a bunch of time and mana when you could have run down while I was getting
a KEI but WHATEVER...
How can you get to a high level and play like an idiot?  OK I'm done.
