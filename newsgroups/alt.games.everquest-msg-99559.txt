Hmph, we all know that Innoruuk is the best god... :b

This part I'm not sure of as I never 'grew up' with the Luclin spells
availible. I imagine that they do not stack.

SK pets are typically green to the caster. At 39 Shadow Knights get a pet
named Animate Dead. Unfortunately, that is also the Necromancer level 20
pet, so the SK only summons a pet around it's mid-teens (in level).

But SK pets are far from useless. They do deal some damage, they look evil,
they sound evil, and they Bash, which is very nice against casters. Bash
also helps if you're a small race that cannot Slam. (Assuming you use 2HS.)
At level 58, SKs get "Cackling Bones" which is simply a monster by all
means. That pet tears through your opponent with it's high damage melee and
Lifetap procs, so don't lose faith in your pet.

No. I absolutely despise Darkness and see it as a class limitation (it
breaks mez, uses considerable amounts of mana, and isn't any where near as
reliable as Snare.)

On the 'bright' side it does look more evil than Snare, and causes some
damage.

Also, it needs to be said that Clinging Darkness is Alteration based, while
Engulfing Darkness and beyond are all Conjuration.

Clinging Darkness will stack with Disease Cloud, but Disease Cloud is more
of a utility DOT. Disease Cloud is a disease (surprise!) based DOT. It lasts
for a long time, slows (almost stopping) regen, and can help you gain aggro
in a heart beat. The downside is that it's a DOT, so Enchanters will hate
you for as long as you live if you don't use discretion when around them.

Fear kiting is possible at 15, but a serious pain in the ass. I couldn't
successfully Fear kite until my mid 20's when my SK was used to casting
Engulfing Darkness. Engulfing Darkness snares more, lasts longer, and is a
little bit more reliable. -Of course, I wasn't a twink, so that is one
factor.
