Supposedly, you can mark items in your inventory as "for sale" and set
your price.  Other players who walk up and click you get a display
just like a merchant's inventory, listing your "for sale" items, and
allowing them to buy just like they would buy from a merchant.  You
have to be logged in, but you don't have to do anything to confirm the
transaction, so you can set yourself up this way and go to a movie or
wash dishes or whatever.

I wonder if there will be a way to set payment requirements?
Otherwise, there will be jokers who think it is funny to buy your 1000
plat item and pay all in copper.
