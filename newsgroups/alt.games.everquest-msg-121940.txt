If you read my original post, you would see that I had read the naming
policy, and my name was not in violation.

You obviously get very steamed up about this sort of thing, and I would
recommend getting out and having a walk around a park (dont worry if there
are lots of trees there..real trees dont give ya lag) and take a break from
this imaginary world that you want to keep pure and un-corrupted by the real
world.
