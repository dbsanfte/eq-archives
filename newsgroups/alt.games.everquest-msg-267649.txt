That really shouldn't happen. Get better enchanters. An enchanter who
got their level legit (non-pled) had better be able to control eight
to ten spiders if not more on their *own*, no healing or they need to
stop leveling and start learning how to play their class.

When we did it the only people we left in the corners after MB became
targettable were the enchanters. We didn't engage until the entire
raid (besides them) were assembled, which doesn't take very long. Then
all your dps is assembled and ready at once.

And there shouldn't be any need to worry about positioning or anything
fancy like that on MB unless you are doing something wrong. No one is
going to run out of mana, no chance in hell, the fight doesn't last
long enough (unless they are low level).
