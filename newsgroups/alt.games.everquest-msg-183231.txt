Okay,

Here's the key for when it happens, worked  fined for me :

If you have deleted your character, the only solution is filling a GM form
on the site SOE site.

I got allmy chars back within a few days...patience is alor the key. WIl
lprobably take several days.

I even got a personalized email reply. :-))

BTW, creating a new char to try to petition on the server wont definately
wipe the deletec characters, as long as you're not

A: Creating a character with the same name.

B:Leave enough empty sports the re deleted characters to be rstored.

Many thanks to all who nicely replied....

I hope this will help.
