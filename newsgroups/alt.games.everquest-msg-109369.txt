Bizbee, have you been eating a lot of paint chips lately? You've
become a complete moron the past couple days...

How? Are you FUCKING serious? There are rules SPECIFICLY against it,
that's how.

Okay, how does it differ? Both violate the "rules" of the game. Both
grant the player an advantage that they could not obtain normally
within the rules of the game. Both are outside influences on the game.

I didn't insinuate it was a race by this statement. Just because I
talk about advancing one's character doesn't imply that I think it is
a race.

Dodge? What dodge? Good gods, Bizbee, you're not usually this idiotic.
You've delved into standard troll tactics.
