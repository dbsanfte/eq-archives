Even though I do have a 65 Dru with 60 AA's, I feel the same way. It's
taken about 1.75 years to get there. I have not played any other
character for more than a few nights. I  love my druid and have
enjoyed every level with him.

I, too, have enjoyed the journey, but eventually did arrive at the
destination.  It's possible to do both.  I am not, by any means, uber.
 I belong to a family style guild that does not raid or have level
requirements. I just love my druid and always play him.

I also have friends who have 10 lvl 40-60 toons.  It happens. Everyone
is different and thankfully the world of EQ is large enough to
acommodate those varying tests.
