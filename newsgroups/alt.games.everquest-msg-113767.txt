its part of the old downtime enhancement of EQ. This entire game was
designed to give you an insane amount of downtime unless you ran
around with a cleric and enchanter strapped to your back.

I think newer mmorpgs are doing this stuff more probably. 

Would it be worth it to you to get .00000001 xp from a kill that was
green and 15 levels below you though? In this case I think its that
they don't WANT you taking resources from players who would get good
xp off mobs. I have a good example of this from earlier today when I
was in rathe mountains. My 56 druid was bored there and killing some
hill giants. Most are green but some are light blue. If all hill
giants were instead xp more druids 56 or 60 would still do them when
bored since the xp on a 35 level mob would probably not be too
horrible. There is not much difference between the light blue and
green ones in level or hit points, but one is worth it for me to kill
and one is not. Since so many are not worth any xp, they are mostly
left for lower level players to kill them in an appropriate group or
solo. It would just not be a very fun game for them if they went to
kill HGS and a lot of bored 54 - 60 level players were killing them.
