When I logged in after the most recent patch, I noticed that the places
where my body is normally dyed was now the color of my skin. Meaning, it
looked normal. My arms on my sleeveless tunic are now not black. My neck is
no longer black. It looks great! After looking around I noticed that
everyone else has changed in the same way. I zoned a few times and logged
out and back in, to make sure it wouldnt change back. And so far it hasn't.
BUT..no one else seems to notice this change. Is it only me?? lol
I feel like I've seen a ghost that no one else can see... if its a bug, its
the best one I've seen so far. hehe

Any ideas? Anyone else see this change?
