Well, now you're talking about one of my all time favorite dungeons. And
yes, there's a lot of good necro usable gear to be had in there. Trust
me, my 16 Necro is wearing most of it.  However, it's soloability at our
level is about nil. I got all that gear by taking my 51 warrior in and
cleaning the place out. The mobs tend to be gathered in pack in too many
places, with a lot of wanderers. Upon entering, you've got a single,
then a double skeleton spawn. (Large or Greater skellies.. nearly green
to you by now.) However, after that, it goes to hell in a hand basket.
There's one more skellie in the tunnel leading into the first firepit
room, but if you pull him, you aggro that whole room. There's an ogre
guard there (two if one of the wandering guards happens to be going
through, and four or five more skeletons all in that spot. I found it
impossible to even attempt a pull past the first three spawns with my
necro at 13. I doubt a 15 would fair much better.

That's definitely a dungeon to hit with a group at the low levels, and
the group will need a good puller and good tactics. Deeper in, of
course, the mobs that drop the good stuff will take your lunch money and
make you cry. And the mobs are a frustrating mix of both live and undead
in most all areas, so your use of either IVU or Gather Shadows won't get
you very far before you are jumped.
