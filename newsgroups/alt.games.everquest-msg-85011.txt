> What kind of experienced players require 24x7 service...

heheh... I'll tell you what kind of damage experienced players can do...

A newbie tries everything he can find... an experienced player knows where
to LOOK to find stuff he can break.

A new player will come across maybe 3 broken quests per month... An
experienced player already knows about 50-odd broken or incomplete quests
and is complaining about them regularly... and is ALSO finding 3 NEW broken
quests per month! *grin*

Think about how many bugged NPCs, broken quests, failed GM events, poorly
itemised or pathed dungeons and other general screw-ups you already know
about... at $37/month you'd be well within your rights to expect them ALL to
be fixed NOW!

We all know how loud people complain NOW about how Verant are screwing them
when they're paying $9.89 (or less)... multiply that kind of grief by 4 and
even Red Adair will take one look at the ensuing flames and say "wow...
that's too hot for ME!" *chuckle*
