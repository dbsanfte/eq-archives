Nope. Last statement I saw from VI on the dev boards about this was,
(paraphrased) that they were going to be "looking carefully" at each
request to transfer back *off* of Stormhammer. In other words, not only
will you only be able to go back to your original server, but you won't
be able to go back if you acquired any "game unbalancing" items while
you were there. The example given was buying a manastone on Stormhammer
and trying to transfer back to a server where manastones never existed.
They wouldn't let you bring it with you.
