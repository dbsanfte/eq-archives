Int helps A LOT. Trust me, get some int gear and your
weapon skills will increase MUCH faster when you are practicing. INT effects
all skill increases.

Straight from the horses mouth, gleaned for various official Verant quotes:

DEX: How quickly you learn weapon skills; how often a weapon will proc; how
quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows. How often
criticals and crippling blows occur for warriors. DEX also influences the
Fletching  trade skill.

STR: Determines how much you can carry; influences how quickly you learn
many offensive skills. Affects your attack value which influences maximum
and average damage. STR also influences the Smithing Skill.

STA: Affects how many hit points you have, and how long you can hold your
breath underwater.

>>>INT: Directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills;<<< affects the
amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights.

WIS: Affects the amount of mana the priest(druid, cleric, shaman) classes have,
also rangers and paladins; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills
if your WIS is higher than your INT.

CHA: Affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how
much they will pay you(get indifferent+ faction and 105+ CHA for
the best price); affects the saving throw on certain bard and
enchanter spells (charms in particular)

AGI: Affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult
it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit. The
largest Agility increase to AC is getting past 75.



Also, for me it seems that fighting yellows and reds really seems to
help the weapon skills go up faster.
