Warriors get the same dual wield and double attack skills as rangers
but the rangers do seem to get better weapons.  At least that is how
it seemed to me.  The CoM 2-hand blunt ranger only staff springs to
mind as a much better 2HB than my warrior could get until Plains of
Power.  

My first characters were a ranger and a warrior.  I played my warrior
to 63 and my ranger into his 30's. I am not claiming experience with
the high end drops, just the drops in those early levels of the game.
