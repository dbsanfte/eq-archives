Have you considered pulling to the outside of the gnoll caves in
Jaggedpine Forest? I seem to recall that I used that zone to get from 48
to 58 as a ranger/shaman duo, and we were always able to add new people.
some of the camps required harmony, but not all (drop-off and the big
room in the back were especially nice).

Y'know, I can't shake this feeling that you've already done some of the
camps in there.  Pardon my very sketchy EQ-memory. :)
