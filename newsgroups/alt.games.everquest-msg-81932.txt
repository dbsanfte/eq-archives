It all comes down to actually *knowing* the mobs that you're fighting.
There are some places/mobs (Kael Arena comes to mind) where the clerics
never let me go ballistic. Can't really afford to as some of the larger
giants there can just go into insane damage mode at any moment. So the
CHeals come sooner to be on the safe side. Doing xp camps, such as we
were last night in Seb at zoneout and guards, the mobs, even with adds,
are very predictable and the damage rates stay pretty well constant. I
was going bezerker on just about every cycle before getting a heal.
Number of deaths (or even close calls): zero. 

I'm still hoping that James is just trolling (in a fun way, not
professional usenet Troll way) and doing some roll playing to get a
reaction. Otherwise, that's a really shitty attitude and I'd be shocked
if he's as popular with all the tanks as he thinks. And if they many of
them are constantly dying when any other cleric besides James is healing
them, that server needs some serious cleric universities instituted.  

The only other possibility that I can figure is that James is Sooooooo
uber and in such a raid oriented guild that he *never* does any xp
groups and only fights ubermobs that go ballistic on the tanks. If
that's the case, then sure.. you can justify the "play it safe" mode all
the time.

Otherwise, you ignore the extra damage (and therefore taunt) that tanks
do below 40% health (every little bit helps) and the fact that a mob
will NOT turn away from a warrior when low on health. (This is max taunt
there, at least for a few seconds.) Not to mention it ignores that the
person playing the tank likes to have fun with their character once in a
while and explore all the options that the design allows it. Clerics are
extrememly important in groups, but the [Bossy Dorf Cleric] who comes
along spouting those kind of lines won't be grouping with us for very
long.
