    Tell me about it. We haven't beat it, the competition did. Once. And
they didn't try anything else in the zone, they just left. This is the guild
that still can't kill Zun, by the way. Meanwhile, we putz around, barely put
any effort into trying PXK, and spent last night killing PRIMALS because it
was the other guild's turn to try (and fail) Zun. We repeatedly skipped
chances to farm Txevu when we were alone there, and now while we continue to
putz around the other two guilds spend every night they can there, all
night.

    And the attempts are so half-assed! Warriors all stand in different
places on tank switches. It took until the last attempt before I could
convince the officers to position PXK so the healers wouldn't get hit by the
AE. I mean, WTF? Your DPS parse means crap if we don't win, Mr. Rogue
Officer!

    That sounds like a healer range error. Is CH rolling when MT moves in,
and are they in position to keep the chain going while MT moves? When we had
early kills like that, that's what caused it.

    I need to ask you a question. My guild got there early, and hasn't
really experimented since the zone was updated (much to my frustration).
Back when we broke in, you didn't kill "them" because "they" kept coming
back ad infinitum. Do you kill "them"?
