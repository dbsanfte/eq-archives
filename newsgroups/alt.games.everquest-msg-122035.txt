[Top posting fixed]

That information is incorrect. You can use FD just fine when you have
dot's on the mob, as long as you stay down until you get the "your xxx
spell has worn off" message.  If you're foolish enough to pop back up
immediately, yes you will re-aggro the mob on the next tick, but if you
are FDing to save your life, you likely won't mind waiting a bit anyway.
Go get a coffee and relax while the spells wear off. You'll have to cast
a new pet and med anyway. ;-)

I did that trick with my necro from 17 to 24 on the gargoyles in OoT all
the time. Works like a champ.
