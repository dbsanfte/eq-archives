Playing a necro has gone from an excercise in frustration with resist after
resist, to so easy its not funny.
I can now regularly solo whites without any trouble at all (at lvl 45).
With things like cinder hornets (about 2500 hp) I dont even bother with
dots. Just snare, fear and med while pet tears it apart. The snare does a
bit of damage, so I get all the xp. I am ready at fm again after the fight,
so I can just pull non stop. With a while con, I drop in some dots to speed
things up, but its probably not essential. My fears always seem to last the
maximum time with no resists at all, even on whites.
Im getting a yellow in about 40 mins at lvl 45. Seems a bit too easy.
