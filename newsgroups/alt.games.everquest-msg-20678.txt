Join a guild, and have a guildie do it
Camp both characters in a really remote place, drop items on ground, sit camp
and log in with other character.  Make sure there are no wandering guards as
they tend to clean up trash and take things that are lying on the ground and
destroying them.
Get a really high level character to do it, who will have no need for the
equipment.
Get a friend that you adventure with often to do it
Make 2 accounts, get two computers online next to eachother...
