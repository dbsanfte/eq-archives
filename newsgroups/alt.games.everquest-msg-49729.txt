  You also heard about the pricing of the upcoming
EQ horses, right?  This isn't going to be like UO where
you can just pop over to any town and hand over a
trivial amount of gold for a horse.  The price I saw
quoted (from a link on EQVault I think) was 9K-15K.

  Which is a good thing, IMO - don't want every
Tom, Dick, and Harry riding a horse (like UO).
