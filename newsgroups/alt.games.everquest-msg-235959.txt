Run Speed is the same for both Drogs and Horses... It is based on price, not
color.  Sooo  the more expensive the mount, the faster it is.  I have the el
cheapo and just click it off to go anywhere.  :)  

I can't find the discussion regarding Drog colors atm either, but again that
has never been proven and is strictly rumor anyway...  :)  

Here however is a neat little link that outlines some various pros and cons for
you.

Also, just fyi since I'm not sure of your class, Pallies and Sk's get the
fastest horse in the game afaik with AA abilities later on in their careers, so
if you are either Pally or SK, never fear, eventually you get a mount worth
bragging about!  :)
