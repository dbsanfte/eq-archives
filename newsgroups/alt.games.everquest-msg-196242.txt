Maybe try one of the more established server's - maybe all the newbies on
Stromm are just a bit shy. Also try a different char to begin with until you
get a feel for the game. Try a half elf ranger for a while - you'll start
around surefall glade / qeynos and once you get to about 6 head to black
burrow where you should be able to get lots of groups. Or a shaman or
something. Your ranger tracking / fighting and spell skills should be in
demand. EQ can be a little frustrating at first all those rats and snakes
and all. If you get bored with your ranger try something else.
