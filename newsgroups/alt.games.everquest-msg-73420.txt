One of my favorite ones was a series of auctions on Ebay where the
seller was selling a complete guide to all the trade skills.  Over
"600 verified recipies and the locations of the needed items as well
as step by step instructions on how to work through them".

Guy started the auction at like $10 and amazingly enough had people
bidding on them.  The one auction was up to like $27.  

My first thought was "Dont we already have this info for FREE at
EQTraders?" 

=)

I guess the Ignorant and his money will soon be parted.
