No shit, You joined  the military and you really thought you could
live anywhere you wanted too? You go where your MOS takes you but you
can pick your duty station, if you didn't your recruiter screwed you.

>-right to choose where to work.

Same as above, you go where your MOS takes you.

>-right to choose who to listen to.

You need to only listen to people that know. You can ignore the rest.
This goes for Civilian life aswell.

>-right to choose what to say.

You never loose this right , You can say whatever you have to say,
just use tack when doing it. As a PFC I once told a 2nd Louie,
"with due respect sir, you don't know what the fuck your saying".
Nothing happened, nothing except I got more respect from the Sgt's and
the other Officers in my Company for speaking my mind.

>-right to choose where to go

Hmmm. In combat , if I tell you to go some where you better fucken go.
But off duty or in duty station you can go any where you want.
Stationed in Fort Sill , OK and you want to go to Dallas , just go ,
what's stopping you.

>-right to choose what to do.

Same as above.

But you never did say what branch you were in.

If you where in Marines it's a little more tight but your not in
prison.

If in the Navy, well your pretty much stuck on ship and you can't
really do much anyway.

Air Force...  Hell they are the most kick back branch out of all the
branches. Shit, you can even have longer hair then the rest.


You must have had just a bad experience.
