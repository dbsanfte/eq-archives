   I don't think I would like that.  I remember once back in
the day before I was married to Lenny.  My boyfriend at the
time got his self caught in his zipper.  No calls for
emergency aid were issued (save to me) and the situation was
resolved with minimal bloodshed.
   I wasn't in love with this guy.  He was only a so-so
lover.  We broke up not too long after, with little regrets
on either side.  Still, I was wincing through the whole
episode, and I wince at the memory of it.  And I don't even
_have_ a dick.
