I understand SOE's ideas of having no XP given for groups attacking lower 
level (grey) creatures.. That is just too darn easy and worthless.  But how 
about granting some level of measured/limited XP to solo characters who wish 
to hunt to kill off some burden.

I don't know about you all, but I have spent some time battling some pretty 
darn tenacious ^^grey creatures that can give you a run for your money, only 
to get nothing in reward.

It might be beneficial and helpful to a solo hunter, especially trying to 
kill off some debt/burden, to be able to any amount (no matter how small) of 
Xp.

It seems that it could be VERY easy to implement and regulate.
