Shadowrest is the new graveyard.  In some zones like Shadeweaver's 
Thicket and the Plane on Knowledge there are new NPCs that will port you 
to Shadowrest to recover your corpse.  The one in ShadeWeaver's Thicket 
is under the Northernmost tent.  The PoK one is on a rise West of the 
main merchant building and South of the main bank.
