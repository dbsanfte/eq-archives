Lesser Summon Corpse requires a Black Ceremonial Coffin, it is about 1pp and
some change and is apparently available at all Cities. I bought mine from
one of the Gypsies in Oasis, try bag merchants in the cities (as it was the
Bag selling Gypsy that has these in Oasis) I can say that the usual coffin
selling in the Cleric Guild in Neriak 3rd Gate does not sell them.

Yes by all reports I have had in game as well as here 35th is the limit of
the spell you're ok there.
