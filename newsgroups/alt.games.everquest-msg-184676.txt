No, it was part of that article. The guy was logged on to EQ all day,
before hurting his kid, while the child was in the closet and way
after the child had died. It wasn't until after he had logged off that
he went "Oh Shit" and went to look at his kid.
I would love to know what he was doing in EQ all this time, Epic hunt,
Guild raid, just trying to level up."hey I got 15 years for
manslaughter by killing my kid, but at least I got my epic".
I just was wondering though, during all this time were was the mother?
