I don't belittle others of their beliefs either, but time is drawing =
nigh and the train will be leaving the station soon, but don't worry, =
God will make sure that it is completely obvious to anyone who bothers =
to open their eyes and we still have plenty of time although we are =
about to reach the first tick on my stopwatch in a week or so.=20



Jesus made sure to make a point of spending time with criminals, =
drunkards, beggars etc. and said that, ah let me find the verse, yeah =
ill just post the entire chapter as it mentions me as well I think. =
Which is to say that I may be this Elias character mentioned here, who =
seems rather mysterious and powerful.



[1] And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his =
twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their =
cities.


[2] Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent =
two of his disciples,


[3] And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for =
another?


[4] Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those =
things which ye do hear and see:


[5] The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are =
cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have =
the gospel preached to them.


[6] And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.


[7] And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes =
concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed =
shaken with the wind?


[8] But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? =
behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.


[9] But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and =
more than a prophet.


[10] For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger =
before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.


[11] Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath =
not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is =
least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.


[12] And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of =
heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.


[13] For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.


[14] And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.


[15] He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.


[16] But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto =
children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,


[17] And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have =
mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.


[18] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a =
devil.


[19] The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man =
gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But =
wisdom is justified of her children.


[20] Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty =
works were done, because they repented not:


[21] Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the =
mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, =
they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.


[22] But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon =
at the day of judgment, than for you.


[23] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be =
brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in =
thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.


[24] But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of =
Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
[

25] At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord =
of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise =
and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.


[26] Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.


[27] All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth =
the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the =
Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.


[28] Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will =
give you rest.


[29] Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in =
heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.


[30] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

I believe that every person has a journey to make. It's like a ladder. =
We are all on a giant ladder. Some are climbing up, some sitting still =
enjoying their achievements, some sitting petrified at the hieght, some =
climbing back down: all on different rungs, but trying to get to the =
same destination...no matter what you name it. I am Christian, but do =
not belittle others for their beleifs. There are some that I believe to =
be totally wrong (they are climbing down). Others just need a strong =
shoulder and a word of encouragement to stand up & continue (this =
group).  But no matter what a person believes, the truth is unchanging. =
Only our understanding of it changes.
God Bless All=20
