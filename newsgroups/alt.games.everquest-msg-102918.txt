Hello Sean,

I can't really help much with the brownies, only let you know that brownies
won't aggro on wolf form, and ask in gfay if someone will wolf form you over
the Lfay line (wolf form doesn't last through zoning). It's a lvl 44 druid
spell and works very well.  Sometimes I sit in gfay/lfay and shout that I am
giving wolf form and people come running.

Raven
