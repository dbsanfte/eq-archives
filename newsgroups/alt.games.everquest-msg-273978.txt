Interesting choice of phrasing.

I find it somewhat amusing that you use slang for courage which derives from
possessing male genitals, then in the same breath, attempt to deny any link
between pussy meaning cowardice comes from linking the term to women.

Not that I expect you to acknowledge your stupidity at this point, but it'll
be pretty fun to watch Lokari hand you your ass in any event.
