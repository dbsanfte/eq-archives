While I don't support a mindless attack on any country that might be
involved.  I do support removing the government of any country that supports
terrorism.  If a country knowingly harbors terrorists, or knowingly supports
terrorism, the government should not be allowed to exist.  Care should be
taken to minimize civilians being hurt or killed, but it is unavoidable that
some will be.
