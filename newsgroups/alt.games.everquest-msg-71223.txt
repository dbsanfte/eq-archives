Sure, pretty easy to fake but more trouble than *I* would go to just for
$9.89.  And if you can't find your CD or case, you're SOL (the standard
meaning) if your computer crashes so you'd danged well BETTER have the CD
around.

A lot of trouble for $9.89 even for the legit folks.  At least then Sony can
at least LOOK like they aren't throwing a hissy.  Meanwhile, to make the
minor sting hurt less they can go with the line "due to the number of
requests, please allow 10-12 weeks for credit" and spread it out over a few
months.  I kinda doubt they'd get more than 5000 people (and probably 1/10
that) who'd take advantage of it.
