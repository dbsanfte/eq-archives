Shit for AC.
No tank is giving up that much AC/hps for haste, or at least
shouldn't.  Mith boots are something like 30+AC, gives a buttload of
hps and STA compared to 14AC on the grey suede boots.

We've been letting casters loot the grey suede boots (at least we did
when we were still actively doing VP).

Huh?
I don't recall any earrings with haste on them.
There's a the claw off Esharn, and at least four belts (Dargan, Lady
Neve, Zlexak and Vulak).

I can't think of any earrings with haste on it from ToV North...but
then with something like 15+ named and one of them having a loot table
of 24 entries (at last count), it's very easy to miss one.

Gaunts of Dragon Slaying is very good resist gear.  Find me a pair of
gloves with better overall resist value and Yelinak is a gimp.
