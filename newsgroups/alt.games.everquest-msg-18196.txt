Yes... I remember back when my Cleric first took up tailoring.  He headed up
to Halas to collect ruined pelts, often buying them off of newbies and
making patchwork for them.  A few of the newbies were awed by my ability to
turn ruined pelts into armor.... so they started asking me to start making
enchanted jewelry for them as well!

With two of them in particular, I had to expain to them _several_ times
that,  a) I am not a jeweler, and b) clerics cannot enchant jewelry...they
needed an enchanter for that.
[I didn't dare tell them about embued stuff....way beyond my cleric's
abilities at that time anyway].
