He can try the mage way too. Send pet on the mob until the mob wants
to run, then tell the pet to get lost.  The mob is damaged but the pet
isn't there.  The ranger can snare the mob and beat on its back.  

I would suggest sending the ranger in early on occassion so the ranger
gets some chances at defense skill-ups if you use the mage method.
