(long list of task-related questions snipped)

It seems to me that what's needed is a two-level (or even deeper) FAQ.
So the top-level FAQ could be for the real newbie who hasn't even read
the box (and who knows what will be mentioned on the box when OOW is
old enough to be part of an Evolution-style repackaging) and just wants
to know "What are these things I hear about called 'tasks'?"  The short
answer above is fine, though I think it would be appropriate to add
something like, "When Tasks were first added (September 2004 in OoW),
some people felt they were too hard at some levels."  But then also add
a link to a separate page of task-specific FAQs.

That's also the answer to Annie's concern that the FAQ should be
something a newbie can read in 1-2 sittings.  Keep the questions at
a high level and the answers brief.  Include links to more detailed
answers and/or deeper (but still frequently asked) questions.  Make
the top level FAQ be the one that all newbies should read, and have
it be in a format suitable for posting.  (When posting it, the links
would have to be expanded to show the URLs.)

And to answer Annie's question, I'd be willing to take over managing
the FAQ (and I have a web site I could put it on), but I'd be nervous
because I've only been playing for 10 months and have nowhere near the
experience she and other contributors have, so I'd be worried I'd get
something wrong as I try to condense half a dozen people's answers into
something readable and brief.  Of course, that's what community feedback
is for.
