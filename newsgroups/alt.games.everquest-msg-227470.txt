Actually, in real life once you put that money in the bank it is the
banks responsibility and the banks loss (unless they can show that you
knew it counterfeit).

But if soe really knew through logs how much duped money was spent at
your vendor then they surely also know what was bought at your vendor
and it would be the least they could do to reimburse those items back
to you in exchange for that duped pp.  Still a hardship but at least
it would not be a theft.
