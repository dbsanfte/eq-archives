Drops off pretty much any giant in Velious.  In a couple hours, everyone 
in the grup has one and they start rotting.  Barely worth selling to a 
vendor, it's what, about 8pp? If you're gonna lug it around at all, it's a 
pretty good newbie sword, up to about level 15 or so these days.

}> Is this a popular thing, for higher level characters to just randomly hand

Yeap, the stunned look on yer avatar's face when subjected to unforeseen 
generosity makes the whole game worthwhile.
