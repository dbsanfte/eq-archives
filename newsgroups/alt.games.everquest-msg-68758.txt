I don't really think they count as emergency patches. Verant stated
some time ago that they'd be patching daily as they worked out various
issues. Ergo, these are planned patches.

From what I've seen, their efforts so far have all been positive. Each
new patch represents several fixes and improvements.

Yes, it was definitely a rough start, but it's about time we started
getting over that, don't you think? It's just a game, after all.

>Does that sound like "compatibility issues"?

One person's compatibility issue is another persons bug. For *me*, SoL
and the game in general work well, though not splendidly. But the
issues *I'm* seeing are optimization related, not bugs. 


You're raving at DT because he didn't agree with your absolute
statements. Things like "The game as it is is so buggy it's
playability is non-existent." This is *obviously* an untrue statement,
as DT clearly demonstrated.

Avoid clearly false statements, and you'll find that people don't
disagree with you as much.
