That's another thing that annoys me: why are these mobs being tuned based on
the assumption that everyone in the raid already has the gear that is being
dropped by the mob?  This is rather like the old adage in the lending
business: in order to qualify for a loan, you have to prove you that don't
need it.

Ah, well.  No point in being bitter.  We'll just suck it up and try what
mobs we can.  Still working on backflagging at the moment - our resident
uber-guild keeps farming Mith Marr before we can get to him, which is a
stumbling block for a lot of people.

Keep in mind the same old sleeves and shoulders are likely upgrades for us.
