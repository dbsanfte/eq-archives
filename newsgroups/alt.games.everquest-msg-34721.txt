I must admit I always wondered why they don't make a trivial change that
would make all trade skills easier:
    Only consume one item from any stack.

So ... if I put a stack of 20 spider silks in one slot of a sewing kit and
another stack of 20 in another slot & hit combine, I get:
    one silk swatch and the sewing kit now has 2 stacks of 19 spider silks
(meaning I just need to chuck the swatch into my inventory and hit combine
again to get another swatch ... not chuck, control click, drag, drop,
control click, drag, drop, combine).

As far as I know, there are no recipes that call for having more than one
item in a slot so why consume the entire stack instead of just one? The best
explanation I can come up with is Brad McQuaid's stock investments in
companies that make wrist supports for carpal tunnel sufferers.
