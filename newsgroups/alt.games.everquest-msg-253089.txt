It comes down to whatever system works for the people n your guild.  On my
server, in the PoTime+ range, we have 2 guilds that do fixed point DKP, one
that does a loot council and one that does open market DKP bid.  There's
also one Japanese guild that does some kind of Borg Collective conscious
loot system (well, who knows what kind of system they really use, but this
is what I like to think they do... I mean, really, a guild that can field 60
toons with 20 RL players....).

My favorite system is the bid DKP system with no restrictions.  Frankly, for
a casual player to earn one of the top loots, it's going to take them for
bloody ever.  I keep a 65%+ attendance level and earn over 100dkp per month.
Those top end items that are going for 150+ dkp are going to take that
casual player a year or more of DKP to earn.  I don't begrudge them their
loots as long as they contribute during the times they are online.

If someone wants to pay top price for an item, so be it.  If someone wants
to wait for the price to come down on an item before winning it, great for
them.  If you want an item someone else is winning, bid higher.  Free market
DKP system might not be perfect in everyone's eyes, but there's a
justification for every item that is won - it is going to the highest
bidder, who earned their points by attending raids and contributing.  If
they don't contribute while they are online and in raids, boot them.  If you
feel you need a minimum attendance to be a member of your guild, enforce
minimum raid %.
