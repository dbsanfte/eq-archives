Ack, those names are stupid, but nowhere near as stupid as one I have been
crusading against for nigh onto a month now on the Tunare server....When I
was levelling a necro in EC, along comes a surly druid with a few of his
higher lvl friends and tells me "this orc camp is mine now. You can leave or
I will just KS you, your pick." Well, being the recalcitrant asshole that I
am, I decided to stay. He then told me that if I didnt leave, he would get
me banned fomr the server, that I didnt know who he was. Having heard that
from many many 12 year old buttmunchers, I stayed on. He succeded in KSing
me on about 1 out of 3 orcs, but that wasnt good enough for him, so he had
his lvl 45 warrior buddy start killing em. Thats when I decided that it was
indeed time to move to greener pastures (which turned out to be the OTHER
orc camp 2 mins away without SOW) and continued my levelling. This was about
3 months ago, and now he is even level to another of my alts, a 35 monk. So
much for his powerlevelling scheme, huh? Well , anyway, he aske my monk if I
would "go into Paw and pull some gnolls for him to kill" I proceeded to
laugh in his face, burp loudly at him, and any other gross things I could do
in /emote. Then I reminded him of the orc camps. He said "Oh I am sorry,
here take this splitpaw mask as a sign of my apology" ROFL. I laughed some
more, and went back to soloing a spire, and he tried to KS me AGAIN.
Needless to say he was unable to this time =). But this peckerwood has given
me a holy crusade against his name...so if you see a druid running around
the Tunare server named Friendlybuddy Nattureboy, just say NO. Then watch
while he tries to KS you LOL.
