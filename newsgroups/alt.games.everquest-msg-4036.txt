Hi,

Try unchecking the box marked "use square textures only" on your video
card's display properties (if your video card's drivers allow this).

When I right click on my desktop, it brings up a page for my display
properties.  There is a tab there for my video card (Riva 128). And on
the first page, one of the boxes says "use square textures only".

Try unchecking that box, if it is there.

Good Luck,

 - Mike Dorr
