Im not 100% sure, but think my warrior could use the taunt function without
putting any skill points into it.

The reason why it looks like you need to "prime" is it because to get from 0
to 1 in the skills you start with take a LOT of work. Stuff like all battle
skills get up easy, but try to compare Sense Heading with Taunt.
Sense Heading take a LOT of work to get from 0 to 1, then it get up
normally. But since you can Sense Heading 3 times for each time you can
Taunt taunt theoretically take 3 times longer to get from 0 to 1.
