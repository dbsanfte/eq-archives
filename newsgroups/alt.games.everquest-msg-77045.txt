I learnt from pervious expansions. Order the CD for my main account,
have it send to a guildie in the US who then PMs me the account key.
Someone has usually got the cd ISOs up on FTP within hours of getting
it. Set the DL going, go to bed, wake up, burn CDs, install. Same thing
with the initial patch, first to get through puts it up on ftp. I'm
surprised VI don't encourage it personally, would take a whole deal of
wieght off their servers.

As for the 'legallity' of it all, /shrug. I don't get anything free,
still pay the same amount of money, don't gain any advantage, just
actually get to play the game. Where's the harm in that? hehe
