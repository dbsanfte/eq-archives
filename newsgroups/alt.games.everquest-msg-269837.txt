It used to be more true than it is now. At one point a DC pet was 
considerably better than an a summoned pet. Now that is less the case.

However, even today, the argument holds for -charmed- mobs. Several 
current charmable mobs could likely solo older raid content.

Or have the model switch to a random model in the destination sone, just 
as summon monster does for Mages when they zone.

The reality is at this stage in the game, especially with the new level 
cap at 70, new pets, DC still capped 46, *and* the new charmed mob 
damage nerf - there is not really a good game balance reason to prevent 
DC pets from zoning.

The technical problems could be overcome, but really, why bother?
