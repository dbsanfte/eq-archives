actually you need to figure str into the formula and do not forget the cap
for newbs that gets partially lifted at 15 then fully at 20.

at higher levels it is imperative to keep a fast weapon in your hand as the
recover from misses is faster and the bonus adds up, as well as the chance
for dual wields and double attacks.

IE.

my lammy 9/19 is out damaging my wurmy 25/40 at lvl 41 with a str of 130 and
my bonus is at 6.


as i am a ranger I do not want agro and the faster the hit the more agro I
can build so when grouping with a main tank I will pull out the wurmy and
agro is not a problem.
