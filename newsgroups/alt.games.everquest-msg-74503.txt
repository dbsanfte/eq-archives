Hey All,

Still working on this.

First - OK I SoWed and buffed my guild on a PoG raid. I'm sorry, I
unintentionally blew it.

I hunted in CB for a while, killed the Emperor 8 or 9 times and now the
Rangers are up to dubious.

Now I need to become buddies with the Soldiers of Tunare and Clerics of
Tunare.

Apparently, I have two quests available that will boost these factions:

Muffins for Pandos (in WFP) - Pandos is KoS to me, can I have an Enchanter
Charm him so I can give a few hundred muffins and get to dubious?

Orc Hatchets - The guy in the Kelethin Ranger guild who gives this quest
(and Orc Runner quest) is standing next to someone who is KoS to me. Can I
Harmony the KoS one and turn in hatchets without getting aggroed?

I'm also killing the DE Prophets and Priestesses in LFay which gives a
Clerics of Tunare faction boost.

I keep hearing 'PoG faction is unrepairable', but does that include the
non-planar factions that are damaged? Does anyone have absolute proof one
way or the other that there is no way to get the Pained Unicorn to like me
again?

Anyone repair their faction succesfully? I know I'm not the only one who
messed up when Velious was new and we didn't know any better.

Best wishes in the New Year!
