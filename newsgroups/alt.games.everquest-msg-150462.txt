I have to say that I don't see how it is in any way an exploit to debuff a
permarooted mob.  VI chose to make the mob permarooted, it was not an
accident (I assume).  They have to know that people will attempt to weaken
the mob as much as possible with as little risk as possible.  I am not
talking about exploiting pathing issues, there are certainly places where I
could slowly kill a mob without rooting it, without it ever being able to
touch me.  I am talking about mobs that VI purposely chose to make
permarooted.  What is any differant about debuffing a mob that is
permarooted, vs rooting the mob first, then debuffing it?  Or am I just
completely misunderstanding what you are talking about here?
