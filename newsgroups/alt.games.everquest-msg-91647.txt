I dont claim to be an Angel. I dont claim to be perfect at adhering
to my own moral systems. But I do *have* moral systems and I can assure
you that in the past when these type of conflicts have arisen I have
sided with helping the competing guild out when they wipe out,
standing aside when we lose a forced roll no matter how unjust, and so
forth.

And no, I dont find this frustrating, and yes, I do have a lot of friends
across other guilds we compete with as a result. Some of the more
"competitive" members of my guild wouldn't be able or want to 
associate with them.

Now, you can believe that or not believe it, but it happens to be the
truth. If your opinion of everyone is that they are always motivated
entirely by that which will immediately benefit them the most I can
only say I dont subscribe to that world view and wish you well living
with it.

No, and I think its a sad state of affairs if you think what I would
call pretty basic standards of behaviour and restraint qualifies for 
sainthood.

>officers, and the *majority* of your members *ALL* that much of a bunch
>of saints? If you were the first guild on your server with a set of ST

Absolutely not - I have , on occasion, had to stand away from what my guild
has done because I dont agree with it. But I'm not here representing the
guild, I'm here representing me.

Yes, I personally would.  In fact, on terris thule for a long long time
we had two guilds who were both capable of waking the sleeper and
didn't, despite occasionally very very fierce rivalry over certain spawns.

Dpeneds what you mean. I'm not in a position of leadership within my
guild, but I certainly do talk to folk about why what I think they, or
we have done is wrong, yes.

Pffft. No, but I've never suggested that would be rational behaviour.

And the relevance of that is...? What? That because there will inevitably
be things done we dont think are morally "right" we should all shut up
and lap it up?

Now, dont get me wrong; this doesnt keep me awake at nights or drive
me to apoplexy, it's just a game and in the scheme of things this is
a pretty small part of it but I personally think there is a strong argument 
that waking the Sleeper when there is so little positive gain to the server
is a decision that can be labelled selfish.

I dont know why you're so angry about that opinion; I guess I'll just
assume the references to "fucking sainthood" are a sign of your
involvement in the topic rather than anything else.

Sui... And this is why I said I wouldnt even comment on that statement ;)
