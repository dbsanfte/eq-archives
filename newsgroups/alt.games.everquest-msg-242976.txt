Boy, I am not liking Everquest lately.  There are sporadic problems that are
seriously interfering with my EQ time.  I have had some serious issues to
deal with in real life.  Things have finally calmed down and for the first
time in 3 - 4 months I have time to visit Norrath.  Imagine my chagrin to
find I cannot log in.

From what I read in the forums on www.everquest.com, login in problems are
on-going and have been for quite some time.

Come on Sony/Verant--my poor neglected cleric needs some quality time--fix
the login servers, please.
