But the reagent is a peridot.  10pp.  Dirt cheap bit of trash that
I can't possibly think about caring about.

cast 10 times with the item swapped in, save 15pp.  15pp.  In
ten casts.

I.... just.... can't....care.... about... that

I throw away more pp than that in GP just to save weight.

Heck, I throw away more pp than that in SP and probably in CP than
that just to save weight.

I'm not going to go hunt up some item that otherwise sucks (and they
do suck, very badly) in order to carry it around in my already
bulging-with-resist-gear packs, then bother swapping in and swapping
out in order to save what amounts to pocket lint per night.

Show me a spell with a reagent that costs 100pp, so that in ten
casts we are looking at 150pp savings, and maybe I could consider
caring.

I was wondering if enchanters, who as I understand it use a peridot
as a consumable on runes, which they may cast 20 times in a single
fight on an uber mob, might find this effect worthwhile.

Other than that, I can't think of anyone who could care about this
focus effect at level III.  Now at level II, where you see clerics
casting their Symbol of Naltron (which also eats peridot) this would
be a pretty sweet deal.  I mean, to the -under 50- set, 15pp a night
can be a noticable amount of cash.  They don't really need the
focus III items, though, and might want to look into the focus II
ones to see if perhaps there's one that isn't quite as lame.

Alternately, VI could look at balance issues, and either add this
in as a bonus to some otherwise reasonably desirable items, or
up its use rate to 50%, where at least you'd be looking at 50pp
in ten casts instead of a mere 15...

Bergh

ps or they could stop making Symbol of Marzin use peridot, and
instead require a sapphire, as the progression up to that point
would suggest.  Not to my advantage, mind you, but this sure
looks broken to me
