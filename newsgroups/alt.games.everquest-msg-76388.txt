	Unfortunately the nutballs at Verant refuse to bracket all keywords.

	The vast likelyhood is that this chick is just 'local color' and not a
quest.  There were similar cases in Kunark, like the baker who talked about
sending a guy with a crush on her on a fool's errand for a Burynai Bundt Cake.
The dialogue works just like a quest...only it isn't one.  There are no
Burynai Bundt Cakes, but since it's impossible even in principle to tell the
difference between a "story", a quest that you just haven't solved, a quest
that you're not saying the right words for to get the information you need and
a quest that's just plain broken, people spent months trying to find the cake
until either Wrinn or VanCouvering let everyone in on the joke.
