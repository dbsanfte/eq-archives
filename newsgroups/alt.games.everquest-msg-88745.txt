Well, you don't want to give up on melee entirely -- especially at your
level.  Enchanters need to keep up their Defense and Dodge skills for when
things go terribly bad.  It will make the difference between dieing getting
a "Stun and run" or a Gate off when your group is broken.  However, dstep is
correct in saying that your life is about to change more dramatically than
probably any class.  At 16, you will be getting Breeze and the research
spell, Mesmerization.  That's when you will want to concentrate on honing
those skills, meleeing only enough to keep your defensive skills up.  Crowd
control and using your unique buffs will become your main tools in your
subtle, but powerful arsenal.

In answer to your question, I used a staff I bought in Qeynos for my whole
pre-16 life, occasionally switching to a dagger that dropped in the Warrens
to keep my piercing up.  Again, though, you're not worried about dealing
damage ... you want to keep your defensive skills up.

Good luck!
Mort
