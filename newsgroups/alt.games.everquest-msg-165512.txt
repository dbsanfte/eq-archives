The reason many of us equate affirmative action with quotas is because
that's the bite behind the AA laws.  It's where the parchment meets the
road.  If you kill quotas, Affirmative Action, as it currently exists, is
meaningless.  There is no intellectual dishonesty in my viewpoint.  Disagree
with my veiws if you will, but damnit, don't sit there and self-rightously
assum that I'm not being honest.  You may as well just toss me in with the
KKK and get it over with.

I would hope you can see the difference between wealth, which operates in
the marketplace, and overt, government-endorsed racism.  I would hope you
could see the difference between something that is avialable to all who
would work for it (wealth), and an immutable circumstance of birth (race).

Kaev, you have no place talking about opening minds here.  You started this
argument blatently stating that you think anyone who disagrees with you on
this topic is blind an selfish.  Where the hell is your open mind?

None of my arguments fit with wealth.  Wealth is something that must be
earned, for the most part.  How do I go out and earn a status as a protected
minority?

You can't tell "go out and earn it on your own merit" from "you don't
deserve to have it unless the government says you can"?  Considering those
two arguments are polar opposites, I would think they're easier to
distinguish from eachother.

You dismiss the things you don't like quite easily.
