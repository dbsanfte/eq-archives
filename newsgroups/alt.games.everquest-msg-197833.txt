A little weak and formulaic, but definitely your best effort thus far.

Bah.  No getting reasonable now.  You started out making an absurd
charge against Dennis' guild.  I insist that you remain irrational,
else I'll have to work harder on my responses than you deserve.

Nice try.  No points tho, it's too old and tired.

To what end?  Beyond pointlessly padding the length of your response,
that is.

It wasn't me who said "Take all that you have, sell it and give to
the poor.".  Here's a hint for you, he was tortured to death approx.
1800 years before Karl Marx was born by the conservatives of his day.

I disagree.  A 4d rabbit could easiy leap circles around my ramblings.

What's this?  Blaming me for your ineptitude?  Tsk, tsk.

Why thank you for your concern.  :)  Actually it was at my physician's
insistence that I abandoned the nicotine.
