Hey Howard, it's just a game, lighten up. And I highly doubt you were
around ,shiting in caves and such. 
Personally I think they should have done want they did in EQ Online
Adventures. Where you can gate back and forth from one city to another
but only after having got there on foot the first time. That way you
at least have to fight your way there the first time, after that you
earn your little port.
But yeah, it's way to easy to get around now. Comes down to all the,
" I want it now" people that come in to EQ. As an old timer waiting
around for boats never bothered me or hitting up a Guild mate for a
port. But now a days you get "empateint" people, these are usually the
same people that have cable or DSL and still think that 2.3 seconds is
still way to long for that picture or Sara M. Gellar to come up.
Damn, I was downloading back with my high tech 1200 baud modem ,
anyone else remember the good old days. :)
