Hm... I see two problems with that. One, I don't think that more than a 
comparatively very small number of people will try both. Two, I'm pretty 
sure that if people are discriminating enough to go to the expense of 
trying both, they will stay with whichever one they happen to like best, 
rather than the one that came out later.

Personally speaking, I'm so generally burned out with MMORPGs that I 
will probably try neither.
