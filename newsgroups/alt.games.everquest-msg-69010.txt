Hi,

Arrgh!  I just learned that the new 1.6GHz computer system I ordered
from Dell is apparently going to be delayed quite a bit.  I guess that
several of it's component parts are on "extended back order"!

It figures.  My current system simply cannot handle SOL.

So it now looks like I will unable to play EQ for *at least* two or
three weeks more.  *sigh*  At this rate I will never see the moon...

Incidentally, Many Thanks to all of you for the advice concerning my
Mother's noisy computer system (another off topic thread that I posted
recently).  She is going to contact Dell Tech support shortly, to
address the issue.

Thanks!

 - Mike Dorr
