Well, that works in PnP games because the mapping from game time to player
time is not linear.  That rest and spell preparation in a PnP game comes
down to the party leader saying to the DM, "We rest for the night and the
casters prepare their spells in the morning", and the DM rolling some dice
to see if the party makes it through the night without getting attacked.

The same goes for travel in PnP games.  In a PnP Everquest, if you needed to
take a boat from Freeport to Butcherblock, you'd go to the dock, and tell
the DM, "We wait for the boat".  The DM would decide if anything interesting
happens before the boat gets there.  If nothing does, the DM would say,
"After an uneventful wait of a few hours, the boat arrives".  Elapsed time
for the players--a few seconds.

Sometimes I wonder if this is a basic flaw in MMORPGs.  When you have
hundreds of parties sharing a world, you can't take those shortcuts around
time flow.
