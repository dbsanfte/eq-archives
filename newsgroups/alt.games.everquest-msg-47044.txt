My problem has been getting groups. Most people play and level with Friends
(R/L or otherwise) or Guild. If I log on with both accounts now I will
double the guild list online (maybe even treble it) We have lost so many
players, that I do wonder if we'll survive the next wipe, it looks unlikely.
Friends, well as I level slow (never was in a rush) I lost touch with all
the people I have "clicked" with in groups as the next week they were 2
levels higher where I might have not even played for Exp again for that
whole week and pretty much all my R/L friends have quit. The saddest part
was that one was finally forced to by pressure from his wife, it seemed the
concessions made to cut back on his playing time to a couple of nights a
week were the inch she needed to take the mile, he was the one who most
wanted to play :�/

One of my friends can't wait for DAoC and no matter how much it may suck
he'll love it, the rest of us are a little more cynical, we'll try it but
are all wondering is it just more of the same and will it have that magic
that EQ once had for us and still has for many, on paper it should have, but
then so should AO and look at that.

Time to learn how to play a caster and deal with SoW beggars :�)
