Hmm, my main char is a 36 Mage. My current equipment is:
Advisor Robe (+5 int)
2 Polished Bone Bracelets (+3 int)
2 +3 int earrings
+2 int ring
Frozen Ring (+3 int)
Savant's Cap (+3 int)
Gatorscale Sleeves (+4 int)
Sacrificial Dagger (+5 int)
Stein of Moggok (+10 int)

A total of +44 int. And this is not counting +mana items which probably net
about 100 to 120 or so.
I try to hunt for most items I have but sometimes I just can't find a group
and simply buy the item. If you're lvl 38 try going to Crystal Caverns in
Velious. I got some really serious amounts of cash there, including a belt
worth 1kpp. I currently have a bank account of 1300pp and got some nice
items (range 100-600pp) to trade/sell as well.
