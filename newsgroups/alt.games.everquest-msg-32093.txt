Oh god. Have you read *none* of the other messages on this thread, or
are you just incapable of comprehending them? An innapropriate name

immers themselves in the fantasy environment.

Perhaps, but that's not the point of the game. If the game was called
"Cool Two Word Names", and was some kind of multiplayer PC word game,
