Macros.... Imagine if a decent one was easily available....

Level 60 Druid sets up a /target hadden macro and parks himself in QH
at Hadden spawn

sit, stand /target hadden nuke nuke nuke, loot. Or something to that
effect. Repeat at 30sec intervals, set it up to never nuke unless
hadden is there.

Lvl 60 Druid wanders off to bed. Wakes up with FB Ear. Allow casual
players to create macros and less honorable people will exploit the
hell out of allready heaviliy camped rare spawns.

Besides, windowing EQ is allready possible, I'm not going to mention
how, but it is.
