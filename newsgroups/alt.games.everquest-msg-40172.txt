Erudin and Freeport for sure.  Check the detailed maps on eqatlas.com.  It
says who has stones, I'm pretty sure, and gives you directions to the
specifc vendor.

Cheap GIANT 8 slot backpacks.  Weighs the same as a backpack but holds giant
items.  Only costs a gold or 2 from a vendor and is easy to make. 2 small
pieces of ore and a flask of water in a forge makes a metal bit.  1 metal
bit and a flask of water in the forge makes a toolbox.
