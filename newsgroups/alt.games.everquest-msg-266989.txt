I am playing a priest class (good) and am lvl 6.  To date, with each 
increase in level a new icon appears below and a new "skill" or spell seems 
to be added automatically.

1.  Do you ever have to go "buy" upgrades or actual spells?

2. I think I finally figured out the Heroic Opportunity thing. Start a 
battle, click Divine Intervention and in my case anyway, follow it with two 
smites and some bigger damage, coll blue effect and a 3 min special buff 
happens. The weird thing is the little rotating gizmo in lower right hand 
corner seems to want me to add a scout move (green) or some other icon / 
color I don't have.  Will they come at later levels?

3. I finally got settled and established citizenship and made my first foray 
into Antonica. Does it seem likely that most of the outside world is pretty 
risky for a solo 6th priest?  Should I be doing quests in an around the 
cities (Baubbleshire, etc.), rather than entering the big world?

Any other basic advice or de-bunking of commonly misunderstood principles 
would be welcomed.

TIA
