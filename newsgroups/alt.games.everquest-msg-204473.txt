I was wondering if someone has a reasonable answer to this question that's 
been elluding me for some time now.

I have a trader in the Bazaar - leave him up all the time.  Why do people 
sometimes "browse my wares" without buying?  Are they "window" shopping?  
Doesn't the bazaar search screen show you what I'm selling?

I *never* just go from one trader to the next just to browse.  I query and 
buy.  

Just needed to ask,

M
