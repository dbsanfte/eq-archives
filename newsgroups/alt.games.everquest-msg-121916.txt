Kind of a rough spot for druids until 49 but you know that already. BW
used to be good for single kiting till they nerfed the hornets.
Basicaly unless you have luclin quadding is kinda tough but still a
lot of single root/dot types out there. Rhinos btw are excellent xp
but they dont quad well at all. At 49 hit the spirocs,  best quad in
the game.
