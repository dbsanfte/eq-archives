Well someone else posted that it proc'd for them at 10th so try it.
Last time I used one it gave me the "Will is not strong enough" message at
22nd, this was a long while ago (when the item sold for thousands not 50pp)
and I know that the Icereaver didn't start proc'ing until 30th. I wonder if
that has now been changed, also.

Groaning mace is usable by all the usual classes except the Paladin (the one
who'd prolly get the most use from it) so yes you can try that but stick
with the Icegrinder for a while, I'd be interested to hear if it now proc'd
for you.
