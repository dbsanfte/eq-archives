So I finally get the last LDON win to complete the set of Mistmoore
760-point blue leather armor, run over to the camp, cash in the points for
the headpiece, slap a WIS aug on it that I had on hand, don the piece, note
the nice stat and HP and AC boosts from it, hit F9 to admire myself as a
fully stylin' head-to-toe electric-blue cat.....and the helmet DOESN'T
DISPLAY!!

Looks like I'm sans chapeau altogether, arggg....I don't think its a display
issue at my end, I recently upgraded drivers and DirectX 9. Grumble.
Anything I can do about this?

(I mean, not that I normally get really into this sort of thing but that
blue-leather look is pretty cool, and this is the payoff of investing the
time to earn several pieces at 760 points each).
