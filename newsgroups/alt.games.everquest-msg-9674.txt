I've actually sold foraged stacks to brewers and bakers for some time, with
a nice increase in business following the recent changes. Around 2-3pp per
stack of ordinary stuff (veggies, fruit, etc) is pretty routine, and
sometimes you can fetch a bit more.

Considering it takes no work at all, just a fierce clicking habit, and I
regularly have my foraged items overflowing into two backpacks, that's not
all too bad.
