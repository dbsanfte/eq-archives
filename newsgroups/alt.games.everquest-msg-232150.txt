god:
3: a man of such superior qualities that he seems like a deity to other 
people; "he was a god among men"

Its neither blasphemous nor sinful for someone to call someone else a 
god. Particularly since nobody here ascribes any supernatural deific 
attributes to Tolkien, nor do they genuinely 'worship' him; they are 
merely paying him a compliment of the highest order.

Chronicles of Narnia was far more allegorical than Lord of the Rings 
was, and it was deliberate. If I recall correctly, Tolkien has stated on 
numerous occasions that he wasn't shooting for anything allegorical with 
his work. Thus to 'discover his hidden religious message' is fallacious; 
a work as complicated as LotR will have parallels with almost any faith.
