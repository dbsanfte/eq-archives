FoB is one of (perhaps *the*) best newbie area in the game.
As things green out, just work your way closer to The Pit,
and then into it (at the ramp that's at the end of the path from
town), and then further northwest into the Pit -- as you move
in that direction there's a smooth increase in the level of
the mobs.

Move into Kurn's Tower when you're ready for some variety, it's
a very good lowbie dungeon.

...or /auction to swap your duplicate for a different curscale
item which you don't yet have -- other people get duplicates
too.

There are several places in Cabilis where that can happen, so
watch your step.  But I forget whether the ganking will be at
the hands of your fellow Iksar, or the mobs which are lurking
there.  But I can think of at least three places of danger inside
Cabilis itself:  The depths of the Shaman/SK guild, the Maze,
and the sewers under the "dock".

True.
