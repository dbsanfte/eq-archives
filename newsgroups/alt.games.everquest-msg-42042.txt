Much, much more.    Evade moves you lower on the Hate list without the need to
stop attacking.  No mana requirement or casting time either, like the ranger
Jolt spell has.

Feign Death will stop aggro while feigned, but you are still high on the hate
list.   When you get up it might go back to you, and once you start attacking
again it's not long until you're top of the list once more.  Evade actually
drops several hundred points of hate from the mob's list.  Gone forever, not
just until you piss it off again.


The advantage for Feign death is that Evade will never completely take you off
the hate list (to the point where it stops attacking).    So it is useless for
splitting pulls and such.  If you evade without attacking, you will still stay
on the hate list, just with a 0 hate value.  (Meaning it will wait until
everything else is dead, then come for you before reverting to non aggro
status.)

Understood.   Rogues are still not a "front class".

A good Rogue will never be hit, unless he wants to or all the tanks have died.
