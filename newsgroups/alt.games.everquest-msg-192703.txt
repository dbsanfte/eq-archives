Pardon, but as I understand the zone there are only two High level
quests to get faction with the dwarves...  No amount of killing Orcs
will help your faction.... unless this was changed in the past 3 or 4
months.  The only way to deal with traders there is to be a
Shortie(and that may just be dwarf specific) or have the ability to
Sneak behind the vendor and trade with them (I believe that's Rogues,
Rangers, Monks, hmm not sure if any other class gets sneak).
