Velious is a far more enjoyable place than Dreadlands, with Iceclad (kind
of
low for you, but handy solo or with a lowbie partner) Eastern Wastes,
Crystal
Caverns, Great Divide, Wakening Lands, Skyshrine, and Kael Drakkar all
having nice healthy hunting areas for groups in your level and up to
around 50.

Similarly, great tracts of Luclin have been set aside as hunting grounds
for the
35 to 45 set, and there are places in good old "original" norrath that
work
as well, Rathe Mountains leaping instantly to mind.

While Dreadlands is a working exp grind, I think its one of the worst in
the game, exp is relatively slow, the mobs aren't all that varied, the
loot
just plain -sucks- (better loot doing orcs in HHP!) and it tends to be
peopled with the least imaginative and adventurous players... not all,
but quite a few, and it only takes one boor per group to make the game
pall, at least for me.

Note that this is the voice of only two characters having passed thru the
35 to 45 life, on only two servers, your milage -may- vary.
