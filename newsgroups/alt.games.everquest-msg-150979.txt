I don't have any characters over lvl 30, so I
suspect that is why it doesn't so obvious to me. I
couldn't see it affecting the 'quality' of the
game at all.

If he was unaware of Evade, wouldn't he be unaware
of other things a 50+ rogue should know. That is,
easy to spot.

What I am getting at is; doesn't the
responsibility of forming a competent group fall
on the group itself?

If they let an incompetent rogue, or whatever,
into their group, then they accept the
consequences.

Would you let any 50+ rogue into your group,
without checking him out first?

Different people have different ideas of fun.

I agree.
