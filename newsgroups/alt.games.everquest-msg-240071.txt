I vote with Graef, fidn would have been ideal. :)

All, right, we'll let you slide this time, just don't let it happen again!

}> Capitalization really helps...
}1) i don't capitalize when i type.  not only has it become a sort of
}trademark, but it also helps when i want to EMPHASIZE something.

I DON"T THINK YOU"RE QUITE FOLLOWING.  I BELIEVE GRAEF WAS POINTING OUT 
HOW MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO MAKE THE MISSPELLED POST 
LIKE THIS.

}2) HAHAHA! none of you caught it when i spelled "compensation" wrong!
}(notice how me laughing was emphasized by the capitalization)

Just cuz we didn't point it out specifically, amid the rest of the errors, 
doesn't mean we didn't catch it. :)

By the way, not capitalizing at all isn't art, unless you're dr. edward 
estlin cummings.

I do think, further down in this flamewar, the original point, that this 
was deliberately misspelled textual art, has been lost, however.
