This binary thinking is what makes the designers' balancing job impossible.
The idea that you can tank or not tank a mob, with nothing in between is just
not helpful, and not accurate except on raid mobs (where the designers seem to
plan on warrior tanking, CH circle, and everyone else being less important)
and on a few one-group "trials" (which I think the designers don't
distinguish from raids as much as they should).

The reality is that there are various levels of success of tanking (between
complete failure and wipeout and encounter finished with no downtime to the
next), and various probabilities of each outcome depending on specific mob and
group/raid makeup.

Adding ANY combat-worthy ability to a class does in fact shift the probability
of the various outcomes toward success.  For raid bosses, if it adds 3 seconds
of life to a knight, that will turn some very close losses into wins.  For XP
groups, a 30-second disc is the difference between success and wipeout on an
overpull or multiple slow/mez resists.  Not every fight, but often enough that
it adds a lot of tankability.

I'm saddened that Sony is taking the "toss out some proposed changes and see
what people like" rather than "describe what we think each class should be
contributing in various situations (raid boss, raid clearing, high-end
loot/trial group, high-end xp group, mid-end groups, mid-level groups,
soloing).  Without that, it's very hard to know what problems they think
they're addressing.  

I can't imagine they intend to make knights tank as well as warriors.  The
question they (and we, as players) need to answer is "how well is well
enough"?  I don't think it can be answered without far more detail than
they've given us.
