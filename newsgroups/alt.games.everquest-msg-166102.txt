What I can't understand is how it actually *saves* time? I can't for the 
life of me figure out how to get my fingers to get to those obscure 
keystrokes. Guess it's because of the short fingers affected with 
arthritis. Shift-anything gives me a pain in the fingers.

Sometimes when I reflect back on all the beer I drink I feel ashamed. Then 
I look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of 
their hopes and dreams. If I didn't drink this beer, they might be out of 
work and their dreams would be shattered. Then I say to myself, 'It is 
better that I drink this beer and let their dreams come true than to be 
selfish and worry about my liver.'
