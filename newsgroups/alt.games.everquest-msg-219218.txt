Not sure what your implying. As a Mac user (I prefer Mac laptops by 
far!) I'm aware of the G5, and the fact that its 64-bit, but I had 
assumed it suffers from the same issues as PC 64 bit systems: that is 
the software isn't 64 bit yet.


What I meant by true 64 bit systems was hardware/software installs that 
contained no legacy 32 bit code in the core OS/driver set, and most 
applications are compiled for 64 bit.

That said, Apple will probably get to 64-bit software faster than the 
Windows world, since Apple is the driving force behind both the os 
software and the hardware.

Except that its not quite dead. I ran into a situation last month where 
I absolutely required a Floppy. We built a new system, with SATA hard 
drives, and the XP Pro disc failed to recognize the sata controller, so 
we had to provide XP the drivers... and the ONLY place XP will accept 
3rd party drivers at that stage of installation is the Floppy drive. We 
didn't even have one in that system until then.
