I'm class F. Grandma has one. Grandpa has one. Dad has one. Mom has one.
Sister has one. Cousin has one. I have two. All of us play 16 hours a day
because none of us have to work. We won a lottery a few years ago :-)

No, just kidding. I'm somewhere between class A and B. With only one
account. Got kunark expansion 6 month ago. Not even planing on getting
velious. But graphix in Luclin looks great, I might consider getting that.
