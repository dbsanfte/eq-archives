Ahh, then *all* your characters are equipped like crap.

Nevermind the rest of my posts that might have been directed at you.  I was
under the mistaken impression that you were at least a semi-serious player,
not one of "those".

You really should warn people when they get into groups with you. 
Seriously, I've had to tell a warrior to stop taunting and just let me tank
because he apparently shared your philosophy and it was draining my cleric's
mana more than a *monk* tanking.  :P

Since Kunark and prior to LDoN?  No, not generally.  :P  Cash doesn't drop
in my exp groups, and hasn't since I stopped exp'ing in Sebilis.
