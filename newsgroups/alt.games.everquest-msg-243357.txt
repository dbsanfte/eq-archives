   It's really odd, I get a message when I try to patch into the game that
informs me that I can't establish a connection to SOE.  It looks just like
what happens when I try to connect when my computer isn't on the internet,
though obviously I am.  
   I tried to post about this in SOE's EQ tech forum, and _that_ server
seems to be down as well.  EQ Live appears to be down as well.  In an odd
way this is comforting to me.  It implies to me that there was a
catastrophic failure on Sony's end, not mine.  But of course, I could
easily be wrong about that.

   So, any else having the same thing?  Something to just wait out, or try
to find a fix on my end?
