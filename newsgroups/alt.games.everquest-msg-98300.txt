They don't just move everything over from Test to the other servers.  There
are a lot of ideas and changes being tested on Test, some make it to the
other servers, some don't.  It really is not something as simple as just
copying the code over from Test to the other servers.  Perhaps they should
attempt something along those lines in the future, the current system is
obviously broken.
