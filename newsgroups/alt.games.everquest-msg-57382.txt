I started a new necro on Test, and Skelton was camping my bind point.  It is
a lot of fun to  be killed as soon as you pop.  The only thing I could do
was to go to task manager and end task eq, since I am using Windows 2000.
If people keep doing things like this, I can see that playing as mob won't
be an option for long.
