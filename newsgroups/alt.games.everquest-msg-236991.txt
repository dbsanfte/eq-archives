Question:  Why do you consider the count of top-posters in some other group
a valid reason to top-post here, but figure the count of top-posters here is
immaterial?  Is it because the count here would show a high preference for
bottom-posting?

Your attempts to justify it by pointing at others who do it is bogus; you
don't really care if they do or not, and you don't care if your
"justification" is true or not.

It seems that your opinion is that you'll top-post wherever and whenever you
bloody well like, and to Hell with anyone else, common usage be damned.  It
doesn't matter how many people top-post versus bottom-post, you'll simply
top-post everywhere.  Your attempt to show that others do it is simply a
smokescreen; were everyone else on the planet bottom-posting you'd still
top-post.

You're a fool.
