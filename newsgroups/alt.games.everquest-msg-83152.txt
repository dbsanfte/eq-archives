There used to be a bread quest that raised Ogre factions but with the end of
the plague in the Karanas that's apparently gone.

There's a Dwarf in the back of the minotaur caves in Steamfont who gives
good dgre faction when killed, and obviously bad dwarf factions. Also if you
can get wolf form you can probably do the froglok pickles quest. Basically
you hunt frogloks for thier meat, make froglok pickles out of it and give
them to the female ogre standing near Clurg.
