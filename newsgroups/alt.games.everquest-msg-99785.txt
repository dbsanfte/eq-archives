You're right in that Caramon did indeed cause Raistlin to see what the
future held with him (Raistlin) on Takhisis' throne.  Remember, though, that
Raist pulled this from Caramon's mind, since Caramon (and Tasslehoff) had
been in Krynn's future dodging fireballs during the reign of Raistlin.  So,
in that one possible reality, Raistlin had defeated Takhisis and had, in
fact, become a god.

Raist saw that when he shared Caramon's thoughts through the portal as he
(Raistlin) was about to pull the queen into the prime material plane.  Raist
then took the Staff of the Magi from Caramon's hand and closed the portal,
trapping himself in the Abyss with Takhisis and saving Krynn from ...
himself.  Raistlin's last deed turned out to be a noble one after all.

It's been a while ... I freely admit that I could be remembering that
differently from the Weiss and Hickman intended.  And you are surely right
about Raist leaving the Abyss during the Chaos War.

Careful ... that's how I started posting to the Usenet lo these many years
ago ... :-)
