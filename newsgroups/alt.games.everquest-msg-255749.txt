    No I'm not, I'm trying to tell you we're attempting the same crap with
fewer people, or harder crap with gear that's only slightly better (and
fewer people).

    I'm NOT pissing on your achievements, but I do ask that you don't piss
on mine.

    Yeah and we're grouping the zones just below that with worse gear - I
feel your pain :)

    Hehe this is turning into the four yorkshiremen. Always wanted to get a

    On your figured above you appear to be assuming that everybody can smack
down a LDoN normal in 30 minutes avg. (about the point where we started
trying HarDoNs) and that the total time to get a group organised, buffed,
and into the zone is also 30 minutes.

    If so, I must inform you that for the bulk of the population both of
those figures are way, way off, in fact you can probably double it to get an
average.

>     Those 50 people in the raid get diddly-squat in terms of cash drops.

    Can you tell me what high end Raiders use cash for? Fucking ballast?
Ninety billion peridots an hour? Did I miss a meeting on the Raiders being
poor thing?

> The
> AA gain is laughable -

    If *I* don't give a rat's ass about AA experience, why do you? I had all
my tanking AA's a few months ago, I've been wondering what my XP bar is for
since...

    Maybe that's a slight exxageration, but I *do* look at gear as the main
thrust of upgrading Kul's abilities nowadays, and I *am* more than a little
fazed by the less-than-stellar AA options above the 100 mark for an SK.

    that's 4-3 and my items blow goats compared to yours.

    I'm wearing four pieces of LDoN shit and I've done normal LDoNs until my
ears bled. I've never used the maps but can probably guide you through each
zone giving a room-by-room commentary on the number of pulls, caster
composition et cetera. But don't get me wrong, I really liked the LDoN
expansion. I have just three suggestions:

    a) "medium" level required - mobs hitting for 700's and points/exp/loot
commensurate
    b) Up the points on the adventure types nobody is using (hostage,
assasinate, etc) until they start getting used
    c) Develop something that auto-generates random maps from pre-defined
rooms. If you think that's too hard give me $1k australian and a rainy arvo
and I'll do it for you. Oh and beer. One case of beer.

    I did, on average, for the first few months. Then the medical bills for
bleeding ears started to rack up, and the sheer monotony of it all began to
choke me...

    Hell, when we were after our first 1492 Tak levels, we were doing five
to six of those damn things in an evening.

    NToV, sleeper's, Grieg's end, Akheva, CT, etc have been supersceded by
Bazaar junk. I don't like that any more than you do but I'll be damned if I
can convince my guild to raid in these places as a sort of protest vote.

    We *are* raiding PoP where possible, but there's a clear limit to how
high we can go without the numbers, and I *am* starting to explore GoD.
(found it a bit daunting at first as time-geared Shadowknights were
complaining they couldn't tank etc)

cheers,
James
