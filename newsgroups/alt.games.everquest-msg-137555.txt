Yeah, and anyone who dresses provocatively deserves to be raped.
Anyone suffering from mental retardation deserves to be conned out of
their lunch money (or otherwise taken advantage of). It's all the same
- an opportunity is presented for someone to take advantage for
personal gain and they do so regardless of moral implications. It's
wrong, plain and simple. They have just committed a transgression
against another human being.

EQ is a very social game. Why should you not conduct yourself as you
would expect others to in real life (giving you the benefit of the
doubt here)? Would you do this to "friends" you may have in game? If
not, then why is it ethical to do it to strangers?

I just think an awful lot of unneccessary ill will is perpetuated
under the auspices of it merely being a game. People should either
show genuine comraderie in game and therefore whenever possible treat
others with good will or they should not promote any facade of such
and mistreat everyone the same. Anything else is pretty much
hypocrisy.

But hey, that's *my* rather firm stance on it. No one ever died and
gave me the final say on the matter.
