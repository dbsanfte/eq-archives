I know not many come here any more but I thought I would ask the group 
anyway.

I have a 65 Iksar necro and was thinking of finally getting some equipment 
for it.  I've been using hand-me-downs I've had for seven years on other 
toons.  I was going to try and max my mana regen and maybe HP also and 
wanted to add some focus effect gear.  What effects would anyone recomend 
that I try to get?
