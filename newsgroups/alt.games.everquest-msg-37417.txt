    Read about some of the drops that were on level 2-4 Sarnaks in Ill Omen
when Kunark opened.
    Read about all the things that DON'T drop anymore in Kunark, and where
they were obtained...

True "Uber Loot?"  No.

Seriously over powered for the iksar's that were of levels to be hunting
those mobs?  I was 22 and slaughtering Sarnak Hatchlings to get one of the
damn staves they used to drop... before I learned that they stopped dropping
them after a week.

But I'm not KOS to the gate guards of Cabalis any more.

My statement was not one of pure supposition... it was a suggestion based on
previously demonstrated behaviour.
