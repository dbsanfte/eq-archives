What a sad bastard your cousin is.... I think anyone in a situation like
that should get serious help. I can understand if someone plays 2, 3 and
even 4 hours on a day (and even THAT is hard if you are working full time -
i know! :), but if you play more then 10 hours a day, there must be
something seriously wrong with you. Let alone the ENTIRE day.

Now don't get me wrong, sometimes me and my friends come together with all
our comps and play the -ENTIRE- weekend. But that only happens 2 or 3 times
a year if at all. And I usually don't want to see another computer for at
least a WEEK after such a weekend, other then the one i use at work, and to
read my e-mail, because it just wears you down!!

I think I have never played for more then 4 hours on EQ.... hey i haven't
got too high levels running around (27 shammy, 15 bard, 14, wizzie) but at
least I still enjoy -REAL- life :)

20 hours a day.... i can't even imagene it! He needs help. Definitly.
