No.. even with 200 skill ID is very much hit and hope.  There was a +ID
skill mod item in greigs that I don't have, but even with that I don't
belive its anywhere near reliable.

The mob will stop and hit you if during its "running around aimlessly"
period, it paths near you again (wheras feared mob = doesn't attack)

In SG you'd be too close to the mob (narrow corridors) for blind to be
effective, IMO.

I use Bio orb a lot for pulling, and at level 60 the number of mobs who
would resist it was really high.

5 second cast time, but I use it for a different reason that you do/would,
so the cast time is just a mild annoyance, rather than likely to lead to my
death.

No.   Proximity only matters on rooted mobs, and "undeads" (sooo many undead
mobs nowadays just don't follow the undead rules!)

Enchanter agro-reducers, and Chanter/SK agro boosters (if they worked for
shit)
