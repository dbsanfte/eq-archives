Ok, because you've been misled by illiterate morons who snipped out the part
they couldn't understand, I'll reintroduce it.  Neat how when the
illiterates don't get ahold of it, it seems that we said the exact same
thing.  :)

What I originally posted:

How did you get that he implied the "revamp" was a "nerf"?  Try a bit of
reading comprehension.  He may absolutely adore the idea of a revamped zone,
but realize that with the lack of forethought and oftentimes sheer idiocy of
the Sony programmers, some quests from there are very likely to be nerfed.

I know when I heard about the revamp I started thinking that I should go get
my resist flowers that I've been meaning to do for a while now, cause they
will probably get "nerfed" out of existence.  :P
