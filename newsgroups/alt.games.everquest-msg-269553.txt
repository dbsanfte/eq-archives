I've been playing EQ since 3/99.  Been to this group since about that time 
too, though I haven't frequented it much for the last year (and my visits 
will be going down again since I cancelled Giganews again, so no more 
goofing off (here) at work soon. :) ).  My enchanter has been my main since 
around 5/01.

I know what they did...they decreased our value as a DPS class.  Perhaps 
your definition of an enchanter was always as a DPS class but I really never 
understood any enchanter who thought that was our point.  We have always 
(until we were broken) been a support class and I have always been happy 
with that role.  The enchanter class is still way too powerful, DPS-wise, 
but I doubt Sony will have the balls to fix them.
