Its quite different... see below.

Yes, we all understand the concept of alternate rules servers. A group 
of people with similiar interests in a particular play style all get 
together on one server.

The farm-loots-for-cash crowd however is different...see below.

You must mean by "$tation exchange" enabling *all* the servers?

Nope, not remotely.  By having non station exchange servers they are 
still going to have the IGE 'black market', and the customer service 
requests saying "my sword is missing from my inventory..." will persist.

Unless they '$tation exchange' enable all the servers. (*AND* broker 
deals for less than IGE et al the CS issues will not go away)

That section of the community is already spread out over the existing 
server pool. They aren't going to all march into an isolated server to 
farm plat for cash together. They have no reason to. 

Most people who patronize those IGE autions do so infrequently... they 
aren't going to leave all their friends and guild to switch servers just 
to get a quick pair of boots of flowing slime and a drogmor. The 
frequent fliers are the sellers and brokers. And those guys will go 
where the customers are... and the customers will be everywhere, not 
just on isolated servers.

People who quit games because they can't cheat aren't players you want 
playing. They damage the community and integrity of the game. Having one 
more person on the paintball field paying 10c per shot isn't worth 
having if he won't die when he's hit, and won't calibrate his gun to the 
required maximum speed.

Sure you can make a special rules field where nobody dies when they get 
hit, where you can make your guns as powerful as you want, but guess 
what... not even the cheaters want to play on those. Cheating is only 
fun if not everybody is doing it.

Pure fantasy, by and large those players aren't going to budge. Unless 
soe stationexchange enables the server they are on, they won't be using 
station exchange to facilitate their transactions.

IGE's market will be the playerbase on those non station exchange 
servers who want stuff (and yes, they'll still want stuff!!)... if 
anything their activities will increase because the ethical dilemma that 
soe thinks selling items is wrong has been greatly weakened.

Ok... here it is... if you haven't already guess it:

The fundamental difference between the average special rules crowd like 
pvpers and the cash-for-loots crowd: 

PvPers want to play together all in one place, and want everyone they 
see to be pvp.

People who want to make money farming stuff to sell for cash DON'T. 

Further: Given that they -can- sell on the 'black market' on the non 
station exchange servers, there is no reason for them to all voluntarily 
pile up on isolated servers.

Bottom line: if a player on a non station exchange server wants the 
necro epic, someone will be there to sell the droppable bits to them, if 
they want a high level cleric box, someone will be there to sell it to 
them. Its not going to matter which server it is. Its pure naivete to 
think that everyone who ever wants to buy/sell an item is going to 
permanently switch servers.

Its hard to see whats going on in the sky with your head buried in the 
sand ;) (That's a general statement too.)
