Well, as you sort of implied, any testimony on this score is going to be
purely anecdotal evidence, so take the following with a grain of salt. 
I know that I definitely never killed a lesser icebone until 17 (if
then) but tried a couple in 18 with success. Me getting a shot at a
bunraii excavator in 15 or 16 was rare, as I wasn't going past the door
in the basement. They became more of a "staple food" in 17 and 18,
whenever I could grab them, but they were all blue by then, not even or
yellows.  The greater scalebones were best for 17 and 18. Always blue,
easy fight. I targeted them aggressively in those levels when I could
find one. They were often even/yellow in 15/16 so I had to be full
health and near a zone line before I pulled them. I was *still* killing
greater skeletons in fair numbers in 18, simply because they spawned so
often taking up spots I like to pull where larger game could pop. And
they were always *at least* light blue, so I got <something> for my
trouble. Occasionally L-5 full blue, but rarely. The greens were the
scalebones. They had been light blue or blue at 15, but were fully
greened out by 17 or so. Sadly, they also cluttered my pull path and had
to be destroyed. Of course, they still dropped bone chips, which I've
got quite the thriving market for, so it wasn't entirely a waste.

Having looked at my xp bar prior to and after killing a greater
scalebone a couple of times right after the patch, I still think this is
definitely the case. It seems to move viibly more on a higher conning
mob than it used to.

Not sure about this one. No need to change the total xp required if you
are just making each kill worth more xp to the player. Result is the
same, though.

Can I get that out of my logs? I'll go look.
