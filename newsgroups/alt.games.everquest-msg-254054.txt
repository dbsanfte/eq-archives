Well, it is the one place I know of where you can see the new
graphics for rats and bats, which I remember had previously
appeared in some sort of press release or interview.  So it's
at least a demo of that.

Also, when my Wizard recently poked his nose in, I noticed that
my "bolt" spells have an odd graphic there: just as the lightning
or flame effect appears over the target, a sack goes flying from
me to the mob.  (Yes, a sack, like the kind you often see if you
drop something on the ground.)  I'm pretty sure I haven't seen
such sacks elsewhere, but haven't had a chance yet to try those
spells again outside the Forgotten Halls to check whether the odd
graphics are unique to that zone.  If they're unique to the zone,
it may be that they're using it as a way to test "line of sight"
spells.  (If the sack ran into a wall before reaching the mob, it
seems the spell didn't hit.  In other zones, though, I've found
that I can actually shoot mobs around corners with my bolt spells.
I'm told this is probably a bug that will get fixed some day. :-)
