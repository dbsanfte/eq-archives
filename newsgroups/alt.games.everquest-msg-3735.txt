It happens. I was in SolA once mining for ore and a mage was
there trying to get impskin gloves. He said he had been there 9
hours and got nothing. Not 10 min after he logged I was whacked
by something while resting and lo and behold its Kindle, so I whack
him and you guessed it, Gloves. Man I didn't have the heart to
tell the guy next time I saw him.
