I shot a message to Verant about an old account of mine I want to use
again - but I've forgotten the password for it.  The e-mail I registered
with a long time ago is no longer valid.

anyone else have this problem and solve it?  how did you do so?

also, have an account that was borrowed, and the person refuses to give it
back.  they KNEW when I let them use it that I WOULD want it back.  What are
teh ethics here?  he's in another state, and has changed the password on the
account.  Yes, I realize it's against the EULA....how can I get that
password back as well?  I'm sure the info has been changed from when I set
it up.
