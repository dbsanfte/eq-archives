God, what a bunch of idiots.

"I joined the National Alliance because I want my children to grow up in a
clean, healthy, White world, where they won't be a minority. I want them to go
to White schools and live in a White community. I want them to learn White
values, not TV values. "

There are a lot more like that. There isn't any real point to this post, but I
felt a need to vent...
