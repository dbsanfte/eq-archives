Easier still, from a "limited space in the zone" standpoint, would be
to add an additional NPC in each bank (let's call him the
"Quartermaster" for lack of a better term) who uses the banker code,
but allows all members of a guild to access a shared "bank box" and
money drop. Yes, this would require a certain amount of restraint on
the part of guild members, but getting an item I'm holding for a guild
member who is halfway across Norrath currently means pestering a
porting class to "play Federal Express" for me - dropping it in the
nearest bank for someone else's later retrieval would be a vast
improvement.

While I'm wishing, I wish they would implement the "bulletin board"
code that appears in Qeynos as a "guild board" in every bank on
Norrath - click the board, a check is made for your guild affiliation
and inter-guild messages are then displayed. While my guild has forums
on its website, the ability to post messages "in game" for
guildmembers who aren't online when I am would be very handy.
