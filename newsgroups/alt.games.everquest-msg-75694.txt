Help:  I'm being informed that when ever I try to play Shauri's
Sonorous Clouding "You need to play a wind instrument for this song"
now I can't figure this out, I have 100 in Wind Instruments, I have a
flute in the first or second inventory slot and I keep getting this
message please help!!!

What am I doing wrong or is something amiss with this particular song?

TIA
