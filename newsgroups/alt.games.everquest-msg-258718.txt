This doesnt actually answer your question, but, it may be a work around.
Since your using XP you can use the application compatability tool to allow
alt-Tab to work in EQ. I Found also that by doing that I also enabled the
window key functions. Windowkey - M will minimize all applications and bring
your desktop up. If you were going into window mode with the intent of
executingsome other task, perhaps this can be used alternately.
