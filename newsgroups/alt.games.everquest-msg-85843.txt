The question is soon to be a moot point anyway when the EQ Legends servers
come online. At that time, nothing on the normal servers will ever get
fixed/
changed again as Verant dedicates all their resources to the $40 a month
players since they are "more important" than the other players, much in the
way that anyone over lvl 50 is more important than anyone else even if they
have been playing since the beginning of EQ. They cater to the players that
are at the top, and soon will cater to the players that pay more.
    Just my 2 cp.
