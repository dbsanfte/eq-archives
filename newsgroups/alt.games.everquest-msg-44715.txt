just one thing to add on the hotkey. I usually just have it set up as a /say
hot key...usually on raids each channel has a purpose ie. /ooc is used for
general communication, /shout is used for puller/raid leader. Also if not on
a large raid, others may be in the zone and /ooc heals are annoying. Think
my hotkeys are:
/say I am casting Celestial Healing on %T
/cast 7

/say I am casting Superior Healing, namely %T
/cast 8

Make a hotkey that says simply Assist.
Make another that targets the main tank (often called the main assist)

Target the Main, Assist, Assist, Heal.

Assist works on anything in the game, it gives you that things current
target.

By assisting the main, you target his target (presumably the thing doing
the damage)

By assisting again, you are now targetting the thing that mob is beating
on.
While that -should- be the Main, if they are asking for assist healing,
then
presumably they are having a problem holding the things attention, or
perhaps
they are purposefully spreading the taunt around for some reason.

Now, you don't need to go back to the main for assist, you can assist
your
just healed target (which should pop the mob up again as target) and then

assist -that- mob to get its new target.

The beauty of this method is that you always get someone who is being
hurt,
while setting up all the  tanks as social keys means that you are cycling
thru
a lot of people who aren't hurt and probably aren't going to be.

Trouble is, if there are multiple mobs pounding away, or an AOE casting
mob at work, you aren't getting the full picture the way that cycle
method
would.

Course you should be grouped with the people that are getting hurt, but
in a raid that's often not as easy as it sounds.

Definately setup your heals on hotkeys which announce out loud (/ooc,
usually) who you are healing and with what, if there are any other
healers
they will be able to use that information to time their own healing
decisions,
and if there aren't, well, its a good habit, and I'm told its reassuring
to hear
that you have a heal coming.  I have a tendancy to use my preset group
announcements for this, and that's not so helpful in a raid.  Make a Raid

bank, you'll probably want to ditch your attack button entirely if you
still
have one, your says should be ooc instead of group, that sort of thing.
