The fact that it's not worth spending to much time fretting about it, I
agree (especially as he survived) but it would still erk me that the cause
of the train could have easily dealt with it. Trains in any dungeon area are
inevitable but don't compare KC or SolB to blackburrow, this person was not
fleeing for their life, let me rephrase that, anyone with the intelligence
to be able to walk and breathe at the same time should not have gotten in
trouble, at that level, in Blackburrow.

Anytime I have hunted in BB and a mid/high level character has been there
they normally ask for the trains or rush to bust them up, not make them.
Trains in BB, as with other dungeouns, are unavoidable but not when the
highest level mob is 17th and the head of the train is mid 50's

I still agree, the OP has taken something this little a bit far but I can
see why he'd be pissed, for about as long as it took to heal or do a CR,
anyway.
