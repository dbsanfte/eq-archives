What game are you playing?  We're all talking about Everquest.

Oh wait.  You're a wizard.

The boat trips, to me, are an incredibly tedious time sink.

Yes, they are supposed to give the world a sense of size.  I understand
this.  But all they accomplish is forcing you to wait.  You wait for the
boat to arrive (which is very frustrating when you get to the dock just in
time to see the boat leave).  You wait for the boat to start moving.  You
wait for the boat to get to where it's going.

Taking the shuttle from Butcherblock to Firiona Vie was cool the first
couple of times.  Now it's just an annoyance.  Miss that boat, and you're
stuck on the dock for *40* minutes.

Does anyone still take the boat across Iceclad?  As soon as I zone in from
North Ro or Eastern Wastes, I hit levitate and run across the water.  It's
faster than waiting for the boat.

I'd love to be able to cross those zone lines without having to wait for a
boat.  I'd never take one again.
