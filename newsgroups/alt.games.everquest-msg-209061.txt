Hi gang!
I've been playing EverQuest (I bought Trilogy) for about a month.  I have a
level 9 human warrior.  My problem is I can't seem to buy real armor or
weapons.  I'm still clad in leather and have a mace.  When I go to upgrade
the "buy" button isn't available to me.  I have tons of money so that isn't
the problem.

Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

Also, can someone tell me which armor/weapons I should have at this point?

Thanks in advance!

Lou
