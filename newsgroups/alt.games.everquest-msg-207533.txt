I found that it placed it correctly if you looted your gear
bottom-to-top in the loot window instead of top-to-bottom.

I'm glad they finally fixed it, but now I'm going to have to
break my longstanding bottom-to-top looting habit.

And speaking of the loot window, It'd be great if (mob) loot
windows had "loot all" and "destroy all" buttons (with appropriate
"are you sure" prompts, which could be optionally turned off).
"Loot all" would only be a minor convenience, but "destroy all"
would be a BIG timesaver when you're just trying to clean the
area of corpses which contain worthless loot (without it, you have
to individually loot every item, *AND* individually destroy every
item if you don't want your inventory filling up with useless
crap that eventually has to be destroyed/sold in a timewasting
procedure).
