Hence my "This message brought to you by misleading statistics"
line. We have no idea how many Everquest players have committed
suicide, because noone has gathered the data.

I'd be very surprised if there aren't at least 100 Everquest players
who have committed suicide, because by the numbers, there should
probably be at least 200 if Everquest has no effect on suicide
rate (the age range most EQ players are in has much higher suicide
rate than the 1 in 10,000 I cited, and there have probably been more
than 300k players).
