Base mob XP = ML * ML * ZEM * GB
Where:
ML = Mob Level
ZEM = Zone Experience Modifier (A whole number such as 100 for
the Hole, 75 for Dreadlands etc.)
GB = Group Bonus (1.2 for 2 people, 1.4 for 3, 1.6 for 4, 1.8 for 5
and 2.16 for 6)

In a group your split is (PL + 5)/(SL+(NP*5)) * HCB
Where:
PL = Player level
SL = Sum of player's levels in your group
NP = Number of players in your group
HCB = High Con Bonus:
  1 if you're under level 50
  1 if the mob is under level 55
  1 if the mob is > 5 levels lower than you.
else
  1.93 * (.13 * (ML - (PL-5)))

The exact numbers in HCB might be a tad off - it's been a while.
