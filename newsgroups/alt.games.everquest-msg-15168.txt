Actually that's not a bad idea if you know that the mob will cast a
specific DoT that overwrites a specific trash buff.  As long as the
first slot is open, anything the mob casts will land there, and you
can then dispell magic/pumice stone yourself to remove whatever is in
the first slot.  
The real problem is that in a big battle, especially against AE caster
mobs, the bards are twisting two resist songs plus a third song.  This
generally makes it hard to keep a slot open to remove DoTs or debuffs,
at least without a good deal of planning.  This is really tough in the
case of a mob like Rumbleroot who casts a 150/tick DoT.  I'm thinking
the correct way to deal with this is to start with a trash buff, then
have bard twist the songs he would twist in battle, then put real
buffs on.  When the battle starts just dispell the trash buff and hope
the bard can keep the resist songs in slots 2-4 with 1 open.  
Now I just have to figure out how to do this when you have all the
bards pumping mana full-speed for the buff groups.

Sheesh, I only have two hands!
