Well, first off, Tiru and I both got our Seb keys last night, (YIPPEE!)
along with a total of about nine other friends and new aquaintences who
all showed up and wound up helping each other, so we spent most of the
evening there, but it was fun. 

As to the tracking issue under discussion, nearly all the people
involved last night were under level 52, including the trackers, so I'm
sure that affects it. The Druids we had in our group were unable to pick
up the forager from the Swamp zone cave. Had to run them up and down the
river to the lake a few times to pick them up. Then, when the second
group joined us, they had a ranger. (Close in level, I believe). The
Ranger was calling them out from the cave as soon as they popped, it
seemed, and we were pulling them much more efficiently.

I will say, those bad boys have a TON of HP for a 45 to 47 mob. The
first one we pulled sucked up two ice comets from the wizard in our
group (didn't say if he did max damage or not) and that was *after* I'd
beaten it down a bubble or so, and then we still had to whack it a while
to put it down.

One last note about the spectral types hanging out in front of the
Emporer's cave. At least one of them can see through Invis. vs. Undead.
That lead to the only deaths of the evening. (Mine and Tiru's) but we
got an epic rez from a friend of a friend who was hunting in Seb, so
all's well that ends well.
