That's what I would have expected.  PoJ trials are a lot shorter, which
means a lot less time to get back mana.  In a 90 minute event, I could go
OOM on 7 or more fights, and still have time to get to FM for the boss, even
without KEI or C2 or other mana regen buffs.

As a Wizard without a ton of AA and with only ordinary gear, in a PoJ trial
I'd just be deadweight for half: to make a significant contribution before
the boss, I'd be OOM for the boss, and to save most mana for the boss, I'd
have to sit out the earlier fights.
