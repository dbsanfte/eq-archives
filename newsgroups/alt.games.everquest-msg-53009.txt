You're at a good time now to get thee to Blackburrow and start gathering
Gnoll Skins for your BR quest.

I've also known rogues to get down to LGuk at your level to pick up a mask.
Visit the Safehouse (see sig) and go the the Library forum for the full
info.

Lastly, if you prefer to solo, you've definitely picked the wrong class.
