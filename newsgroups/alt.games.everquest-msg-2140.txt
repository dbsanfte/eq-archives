Every 16mins something will spawn on the single bone by the zone to WC in
befallen. Kill it before it runs down stairs.  If it runs downstairs, dont
worry too much, it may just delay the spawn a few mins.  Gynok appears to be
totally random.  I have camped him for 3 hrs only to have him spawn twice in
a row.  Some people have camped him for days.  Its just down to luck.

Gynoks common drop is the plat ring... his rare is indeed the gold ring.
However I prefer to camp the guk weed from the fungus mutant for the gold
ring since Gynok takes way too long :) I have never seen the copper ring
drop though.  Just remeber the paw rings all have stupid stats like
+1agi -1cha or something.
