re the subject line, if that's how you look at it... yes.

Clerics do a lot more, but during the fighting, if you are trying to
compare it to your previous role as a puller....  yes.

Sorry. But it's a critical job that everyone will thank you for. If it's
not to your temperment, then it might be wise to go back to an offensive
caster or melee before you invest too much time into it. Just MHO of
course.
