From the EQLive forums:

"The word from the devs about this is that the ability to be able to
regain mana as though you were meditating while on a mount was not
intentional so as a balance to this unitentional effect you are not
able to cancel a spell while on a mount.  If they were to change the
inability to interrupt a spell while you are mounted they will also be
fixing the unintentional ability regain mana as if meditating while
mounted.  It is a trade off and not one devs are eager to upset the
player base with by flipping the two now that everyone uses mounts for
the mana regen.

Ky"

It boggles the mind that they still added the /stopcast command,
though, unless it's some sort of guerilla warfare from a dev who wants
it to work on horseback... ;->
