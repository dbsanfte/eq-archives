Bristlebane is the master of the Plane of Mischief and halfling God of
Practical Jokes and Tricks and everything else that is fun and
amusing. He appears as an extra large halfling with shaved feet.
(looks like he took the hair from his feet and put it on his eyebrows)
His common worshippers consist of bards, rogues, halflings, and
gnomes. Never let one deal you a hand of King's Court.
