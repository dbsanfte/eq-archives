Logged in early today for an extended play session with my
friends.  There were no tanks LFG so we decide to do a 5 
person LDoN.  When did LDoN 65 normal become so easy?

By the time we completed it, one of our tank friends was on
and looking to do some exploring.  It was time to check out
GoD finally with my real characters and my friends to back
me up.  It also served as an acid test for Teamspeak(*).

We were flying blind, just tidbits I'd heard about Barindu
and the sewers.  A lot of people on various forums were complaining
that GoD wasn't living up to being a 50+ expansion and were
claiming it's a 65 Uber expansion. 

We zoomed along the zone wall in Natimbi, searching for a 
zoneline.  We easily dispatched the Cyan and low DB mobs that
occasionally harassed us, and found our way to Qinimi.

There we ran into a small problem - a group that trained us
with a name and several adds while our cleric/wizard was afk.
We won, but they died.  To add insult to injury, the other 
group got pissy about us killing the name and looting him.

Recovering from that (and killing the name a couple more
times just for giggles) we proceeded along the zone wall - 
through a structure at the back and zoned into Barindu, the
hanging gardens.  I really like the look of these zones,
by the way.  During our explorations someone's invis dropped
necessitating an insta evac.

The second trip brought us to the pyramid, where a see invis
mob caused the death of 2 party members.  We dragged them
to an out of the way area - and while looking around I realized
it must be the entrance to the fabled sewers.  Our druidess
tracked the high priest, who gave us the job of finding the
cause of and stopping the stonemite infestation.

In we went - every buff on, ready for these fabled 1200 hitters
to hand our sub-elemental, decidely non-uber party our heads.
Just for reference, the party consisted of 6, 65's - Cleric with
200+ aa's, Druid with 200+ aa's, BL with 18 aa's, mage with 69
aa's, wizard with 34 aa's and warrior with 71 aa's and 8k group
buffed HP.

Pets up, we got ready for the first pull.  A white con fly.
We were pleasantly surprised, it may hit hard, but had far
less HP than a BoT mob and didn't seem to do vastly more damage
than say, a Kriger.  We proceeded in, hugging the left wall.

Our first mishap was when the druid caught healing aggro, my
slow was resisted and the cleric decided the mob had moved off
her to the MT and didn't heal her.  We quickly rezzed her and
moved in further.  At one corner we got and add and I didn't
get it slowed fast enough - the tank went down but we won the
fight.  Finally, very close the room with a named NPC in it
we got a double pull and lost the cleric and tank and the druid
evaced us.

A quick note here - CR is simple, just have everyone leave the
expedition and the bodies pop in about 10-15 minutes.

We rebuffed and tried again, but got a little careless at the
room outside the name again - this time because we didn't clear
enough to avoid an add from a roamer.  We were almost out of
time and got rushed.

This was a full party wipe as the wiz and druid dropped early.
CR took all of 15 minutes (you can bind in Nedaria, use farstone
magic to get to Natimbi and invis to the sewer with ease).

With time running out for our play session, we called it a day.

On the XP side of things, those mobs were giving in excess of 2%
of an AA per kill.  At a guess 2.25% as I saw 3 2%'s followed
by a 3% gain several times.  Also, we were killing at about 30
kills per hour, compared to 35ish in BoT for the same group.  So,
a group that can grind in BoT and take names is more than capable
of XP'ing in the sewers.  The key is patience in pulling - even
a small delay in getting an add slowed can be fatal when mobs hit
for 1200+  There were several times when we killed unslowed mobs -
one was immune to slow, another just resisted so much that it
died before slow stuck.

Also, this was with my level 60 slow.  I have the cash for the
65 slow but have been reluctant.  I suppose I'd better just shell
it out now that I won't be seeing even infrequent rune drops 
for a while.

(*) Teamspeak.  I really like it - of the four people in the 
party, 3 of us had it installed, 2 of us have mic's.  It greatly
aided coordination.  BTW - the $7 labtec mono headset mic's I
got work beautifully.  They have a very restricted range to pick
up sounds and transmit almost no environmental noise.
