It's one thing to be begged from when you're level 44 (yet still something I
don't do and never will do) but even better is to be begged from when your
level 8.

I was on the other day walking around with my 8 DE Necro and this guy says
to me "Spare some pp for a newbie?"  I actually had an abundance of money at
the time because of a friend so I was thinking, "Well, why not, give him a
couple pieces get him his first couple spells, I'll be nice today."  So I go
up and inspect him and he's decked out in armor.  Not great armor or
anything, but all leather whatever, you know all the newbie stuff, that I
didn't have until I could afford it at level 4 or 5, and some stuff better
than what I had at the time.  So I'm like, "How did you get all that armor
and still be level 1?"  He tells me he begged from some guy and he gave him
22pp and that he hadn't fought anything yet.  I'm not sure if I even
responded to him, just laughed and walked away.
