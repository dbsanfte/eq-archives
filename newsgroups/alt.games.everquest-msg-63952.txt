Bah...it's kind of like tboots.  On the one hand, it's nice that it
helps travel.  On the other hand, as someone who put in my time in SRo
to get jboots, it's annoying that those who decided that it was not
worth it, so were out earning XP and money, then got to spend that
money to just go buy tboots.  Yeah, I know jboots are better, because
of instant cast.

The teeth change is worse, because with tboots, they give an
alternative to a long boring camp.  With teeth they are giving an
alternative to an exciting adventure (well, for the GD and WL teeth,
anyway...those are easy no matter what faction.  CS can be a pain if
you aren't on good terms with the dragon, and getting that faction up
can be long and boring, depending on how you do it).
