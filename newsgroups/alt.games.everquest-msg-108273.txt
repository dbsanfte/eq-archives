You generally want your fastest in primary, best ratio in secondary.  You 
get a primary-hand damage bonus (depending on level) with every hit with 
the primary hand, so the more you swing, the more you hit, the more damage 
you do.  There is no damage bonus on off-hand weapon, so slow, good-ratio 
weapons work well here.  The ratios on your two weapons are pretty close, 
with the Centi being slightly better, so Symph Saber in primary (faster) 
and Centi in off-hand (better ratio).
Don't forget to learn the all-instrument twist.  Can be as fast or faster 
killing than even twinked tanking.
