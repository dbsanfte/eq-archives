I'm pretty sure that when the US became involved in the European theater in
'41 that the work wasn't done. Otherwise the war wouldn't have gone on for 4
more years. At the time the US became involved they were also fighting a war
in the pacific. I don't recall a great outpouring of support or help in that
theater of operations. So the US fought a war against two enemies on two
seperate fronts and still won both wars. And before the US became involved
in the European conflict, US fighter pilots were already in Britain fighting
with the RAF. Maybe you should read a few history books before you make
comments like that.
