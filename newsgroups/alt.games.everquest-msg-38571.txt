Not true . I left UO when they nerfed casting spells from scrolls . It was
what my well loved character had specialized to do . They made my character
non viable for fun so I left. I did not restart a new character . I did not
go directly to everquest since Eq wasnt up yet . I played magic , bridge ,
settlers of catan , and angband . You can just fuck things up enough that
people just go bye bye and thus also your money .

Trivial loot code is that sort of mistake . I wouldnt be a bit suprised if
they didnt take an immediate 25% population hit in luclin over it . I also
know for a fact that 3 people have left already because verant just said
they where gonna do it . For some it is just that little thing that switched
the game from the fun to the not fun category and poof they are gone . Oddly
enough that includes the roleplayers .
