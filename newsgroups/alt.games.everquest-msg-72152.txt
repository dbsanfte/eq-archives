Afraid not...  My wizard kills 4 blue mobs in 1 minute.... His mana bar is
then at around 70%, He sits and meds for around 3 minutes to regain that
mana (back to Full) and then kills another 4.  So do the math and that is 8
blue conning mobs in 5 minutes... with downtime included (very rough figures
but it should give you a general idea)  Can your ranger beat that...i dont
think so...in fact your the first ranger i have ever met (My brother plays a
lvl 59 Ranger on Ayonae Ro server) that thinks he solos better than a
wizard.  And by saying you do, you are also saying you solo better than a
necromancer.  Becuase i know for a fact that my Wizard kills more Blue
conning mobs in 10 minutes than my necromancer can...downtime included.
