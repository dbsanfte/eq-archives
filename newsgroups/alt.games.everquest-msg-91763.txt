Actually it is very close to what I did. But I ran with a level 1
Erudite enchanter through the whole of antonica (Shortened a few
zones: Erudin -> Queynos -> Karanas -> HPH -> Kith -> Commons -> FP ->
Timorous -> OT -> FoB)
and over to the Field of Bone and started levelling there. It's quite
a trip and your heart's pounding more than it should when thinking
where you had your last bind. Try it .. lots of fun :) Especially when
invis drops and such.

That's very easy. The only real danger lies in Warslik Woods, because
of
the sight problems. But if you managed to get from Cabilis through WW
to OT, it's a piece of cake. Get invis and sow from a cabilis shaman
for WW and maybe a few SoW potions for the run if you can afford em
(about 10 pp a dose). In OT, you can just follow the wall north, then
along beach close to water till OT dock (avoid dock), then wait for
boat, swim onto it and mount by a slanted barrel (betetr wait at the
pier inside the dock, stay far enough from it though). In timorous
avoid the ogres. Once in Oasis, just head to the EC tunnel. Merchants
in there are not KOS to you. You'll have to carry all your money
though unless you got two comps and a mule in FP :)

Hurr, was I glad to be a shaman with STR enhancing spells, SoW and
invis :P

Works. One warning: The north zone wall is VERY steep and I constantly
manage to damage me pretty well there. A low level might get into
danger quick. Levi off a peep in DL might help. Second, near the
tunnel to hidden valley is a lot of wandering dangerous mobs to you.
Stick on walls is imperative there. Last but not least: Do not assume
ther's nothing in the tunnel. It's rare, but I sometimes see a giant
or else trapped in there :)

Try to unmap you 'a' (attack) key. I accidentaly hit a scion after I
made such a trip..
