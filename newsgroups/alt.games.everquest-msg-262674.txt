SSDG?  I've not seen this acronym before.

It's always hard to know how to respond to a repost.  I'll just pretend the
author is actually reading, and anyone who feels like commenting please do so.

My basic philosophy: this is a game content problem, _NOT_ an antisocial or
immoral activity.  It is likely prohibited by the game's ToS, but we all know
that that carries weight only so long as it's actually enforced by the server
owners.

Every harm to players that comes from buying/selling game items for
out-of-game currency is caused by the game developer making valuable
tradeable items come from campable and exclusive content.

Don't see any problem yet.

>Those players have to aquire it, so they go to great lengths to get it. 

The implication that the RL money is the only (or even primary) cause for
players to go to great lenghts to get highly-valuable in-game resources is
simply wrong.  There was camping and killstealing long before there were RL
markets for in-game items.  Many players are jerks, and monopolize content.
Many games have monopolizable content.

I don't play that game, but I take it this is a valuable item.  In a static
camp where players can and will fight over it.  What possible outcome can you
expect, regardless of whether RL money comes into it?

Because it wasn't well known, I presume.  Otherwise, there'd be folks camping
it 24/7 just to sell it for game money, if you can buy 4 or 5 upgrades when
you sell the ring.

Ok, so this hasn't changed your situation at all.

Your guild overreacts and you blame not your guild, not the game designer, and
not even the campers, but the company acting as middleman between buyers and
sellers? 

>Most current servers already have Chyme campers. They're ruining the

Badly-designed part of the game, and was bound to happen once the value and
campability of the item was well known.  Play the parts of the game you like,
and ignore the parts you don't.

>What angers me most about the whole thing is that Square-Enix has done

Legit beef.  S-E isn't enforcing ToS, and you probably should stop playing if
that makes it un-fun for you.  You might even have cause to demand a refund,
if you can convince anyone that you bought it based on false promises.  Good
luck with that.

In any case, leave the blame where it belongs: game designers who create the
situation, players who camp content for whatever reason, and game companies
who don't enforce their ToS.

>So what's the point of this whole rant? Partially it's to educate the 
>public, who really doesn't care in general

Heh.  Put me in that camp too.  I care about bad game design (which EQ has in
abundance, along with enough good to keep me here).  I care about lack of
enforcement of rules (again, applies to EQ as much or more than FF).  I don't
care about selling game items for cash.  It's a result, not a cause.
