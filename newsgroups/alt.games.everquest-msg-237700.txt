I assume that's a typo and you were grouped as the necro...regardless, I
think the real problem here is that group lineup. A ranger (who's 3 levels
lower than anyone else to boot) as the tank, a druid as the only healer,
only four players total? Hmm. Put it this way: none of those things alone
mean you can't do an LDoN adventure without a wipeout, but altogether I sure
wouldn't like the odds.
