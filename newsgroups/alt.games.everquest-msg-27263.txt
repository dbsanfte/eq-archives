this page loads MUCH faster now.
i have some questions about the captures.
why would they Blur some of the guild chat?
how is the the Photographer didnt get his ass kicked when he was taking the
pictures espcially since everyone in his group is dead and Keryfm is right
in front of him beating on his buddys corpses even. Surly the sleeper can
see invis?
im guessing they want to keep secret how they woke up the sleeper.
