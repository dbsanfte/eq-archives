At the end of the summer I left 3 mid twenties characters
behind on Povar to join RL friends on Lanys.  I've concentrated
on one character on Lanys since then, but I miss my Bard
and my Shaman and have been wondering when I might
have a chance to recreate them.  Now I can just transfer them
over (lost items, lol, they were hardly uber to begin with :).

$75?  If I were worried about it, I'd just not have my
daily mocha at starbucks for a month or so.

If they mess it up, oh well, it's not like I was playing them.
