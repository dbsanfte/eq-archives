Probably lack of familiarity, Skel.  I personally know one person who plays
a beastie, and I seldom get to group with him.  They just don't pop to the
front of my mind...

Ok, BST brings mass DPS, emergency offtanking, and backup heal/buff/slow
(shaman line) to the table.  In that case, they'd be a good swap for the RNG
in the alternate set, or could step in as a DPS class in the first set -
with a true shaman there, no need for BST buffs / slows.  (Remember, this is
a 40s group; it's not until high 40s you get Spiritual loving.)
