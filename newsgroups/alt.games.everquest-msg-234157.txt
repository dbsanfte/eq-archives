Haha, so typical of people to say its always enough. Seems some people
prefer being limited in certain ways instead of having freedom. I therefor
agree with you but take your idea one step further and vote that they remove
7 spellgems down to 1 (irony so you can see how stupid your ideology is). If
you need more, you need to re-evaluate your strategy or join a zerg force
(which SOE's current game design leads up to anyway).

To me, its silly that a hybrid caster can have as many spells up as a pure
caster, and get this... i even know hybrids with more mana than pure
casters! LMFAO!

"Welcome to endgame PoP... where casters become tanks and tanks become
casters and hybrids end up being better than both."
