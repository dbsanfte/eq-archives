Sigh.

Kromrif are the common guards that wander outside and on the main drag through
Kael.  Their faction is easy to raise by killing dorfs.  Once you are dubious
to them, you can get through Kael and bank, and once you are apprehensive to
them you can buy basic stuff at a little area to the north of the main drag.

Kromzek are the higher level giants.  You need to be allied with them to get
Kael quest armore.  They are more difficult to get faction, by killing
coldains, but you can at least get non-Kos that way.  Killing dragons, turning
in dorf heads to Bvelllos are easiest ways to get Kromzek faction up.

King Tormax faction can be raised only by 1) giving heads to Bvellos, 2)
killing dorfs in Dain's court (royal guards, Chamberlain, Seneschal, Daine, and
I think huntsman/scribe), 3) killing dragons nobles.  His faction is less
important until very high levels; however, you have to be non-KOS with him to
get Kael quest armor.

The Coldains in Icewell are tough, by the way, and are almost completely immune
to magic (including root and mez).
