Harmony wouldn't have worked even before the nerf -- FG is an
indoor zone.

Wyverns in Cobalt Scar ought to be great for you.  That's where
all the other 50-ish Druids go.  :-)

And/or the Othmir (otters) in the same zone, but personally
I find them too cute to kill.

The Wyverns are even easier to hunt if you've gotten non-KoS
with Claws of Veeshan (the Velious dragon faction), because
then unwanted adds become less of a problem, but it's doable
even without good faction.

Just leave Yvolcarn alone, he'll eat you for lunch.
