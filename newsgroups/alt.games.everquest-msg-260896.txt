I had mine on, and had predownloaded some of the files.   But at some point,
*every* expansion got clicked off.   I don't know if it was a bug, or a
crash that erased my optional downloads but I only found it when I went in
this morning to do a thurough file check, after the PoD wouldn't teleport
me.

Had 90 minutes of downloading, even with the predownloads I had done the
week before.
