Thats such complete and utter bullshit that I want to puke.

Fine.. You want to make it to Knights can tank as well as,  if not better
than (due to snap aggro  )  my warrior then SOE should give me the ability

Dont EVEN talk to me about the new Regeneration crap. It may be nice at the
lower levels but its nothing more than a toy at high levels.
