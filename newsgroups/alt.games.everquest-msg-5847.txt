Good. I hope I can find that version.

My sis's machine.. Pentium 500 I believe, with an ATI Rage Fury 32 MB card.
Ram is 256 *I THINK*...I didn't do this build, my ex did, so I am pretty
sure these specs are at least almost accurate. lol. Is this a fairly good
system for EQ? I know FA needs a fairly fast machine to run. I know she has
no plans of upgrading, so I hope this will do.
