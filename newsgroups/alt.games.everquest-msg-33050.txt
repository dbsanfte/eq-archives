No no! Charlie McCarthy was my hero! Besmirch not his name! He is one of the
great philosophical minds of our time. Except maybe for Mortimer Snerd. And
when these two were together, they would delve deep into the nonsensical
madness of the metaphysical puzzle. Observe one of their finer moments:

Mortimer: Whatcha doin?
Charlie: Nothing
Mortimer: But then... How do you know when yer done?

Deep man... Deeeeep.
