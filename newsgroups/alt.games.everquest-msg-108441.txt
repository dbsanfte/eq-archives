I ended up making a wood elf ranger mule for tracking.  Levelled him up 
using the bone quest in the Kaladim pally's guild then Crushbone orc belt 
quest in Kaladim warrior guild.  Can get you up to about 8 in an evening if 
I remember correctly.

I then took the boat to FV, made my way to SONH and carefully avoided 
froggies till I could get near the city gate.  Only the froggies, iksar and 
skellies will aggro on you, so if you stick to the west zone wall and avoid 
them you can get to the city gate.  

After getting there I tracked the 'Froglok Escort'.  I think the is the 
guy's name.  Not the 'a froglok escort' but the one with the caps.  The FE 
is usually on the left along the road across the cove as you come out of 
the city.  I then killed anything that ran up to him and slowly walked 
away.  After several kills usually the escaped slaves will start to pop.  

I would then kill the slave, switch to my Iksar, loot the body after it 
became lootable(right click on the body from afar.  When the timer is less 
than 6 min you can loot.), switched back to my ranger and checked track for 
any I might've missed while relogging on. Repeat process till you have all 
the shackles you want.  I was able to get about 2 or 3 slaves per spawn 
cycle for the FE this way.

Oh and the FE will walk off at one point.  He heads to the froggie city to 
despawn.  You will have to wait a bit for him to respawn.  Not sure of the 
duration though.  Also if you find him in the water kill him and wait for 
him to respawn.  The PH and Escapees don't seem to come up to the FE if he 
is in the water.

I hope this helps.  This process is clearer on the Everlore site.  Search 
for Froglok Escort in the beasties section.
