Ah, well your scenario works very well if you are the number one guild
on the server and the first (and more importantly *only* one trying him
in the beginning.) This thread is still talking about Lotus Cult,
remember. The other guilds weren't going to have the option of "picking
away at it" according the generous term's of LC's offer. They were going
to get a day or two each to take a shot, inevitably fail, then be told
that they no longer got any attempts at RZ. This was, in all likelyhood,
a one time window of opportunity for them to get that flag. In my
opinion hardly the most "fun" way for them to kill RZ, but they saw
their opening, took it, and got the flags. Pretty much end of story.
