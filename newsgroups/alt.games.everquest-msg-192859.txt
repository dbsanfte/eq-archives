They are slower than you . RUN AWAY IF IT RESISTS FIRST MEZ . You will have
hard aggro on the mob and it will chase you . Note that as long as it dosent
catch you you are doing exactly your job of keeping one mob occupied while
the other is killed.

Once you have mastered running away you can proceed to running just far
enough away to again try to mez or root. You wear a robe , you have no hps ,
you are a two hit mob. It hits you you hit the floor so play it smarter than
just standing there and taking it.

On the other hand do keep arcane rune up at all times once you get it and
eldritch rune should be purchased with your first few aa`s . It works even
while you are running.

Notice that the above will piss off tanks from time to time who will scream
at the top of their lungs dont run or we cant taunt. Every time you listen
you will die :p The only tanks you should ever trust to pull a mob off of
you are rangers and paladins that you KNOW. Rangers can snare while paladins
can stun. Clerics and druids can also save your butt but they generally dont
pay attention.

p.s. since i will undoubtedly piss of an ignorant tank or two , realize that
the above advice is for experience hunting in open nonrestricted areas.
