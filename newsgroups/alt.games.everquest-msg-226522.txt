I doubt that they'll let warriors taunt better than the knights
currently do, it would screw up raids too much. In an exp group,
nobody would care unless they nerfed a knight's agro in the process.
Knight taunt is good enough for any situation, it's irrelevant whether
a warrior taunt is as good or better. 

My guess is that warriors still won't hold agro as well as knights,
just that the difference will be a lot less noticieable. The tradeoff
(imo) should be between a warrior who's taunt is 'good enough' but who
tanks the best and a knight who's agro is the best but who's tanking
ability is 'good enough'. I'm curious to see whether SOE can pull it
off, just glad I don't have a horse in this race <g>.

Agreed

I still group with some of the same knights I grouped with back in
Kunark ( in my 30s), so yeah, I do remember how bad off paladins where
(and it was pretty bad). Never really saw that problem with SKs
though, even back then they were my favorite tank. ... but there's a
shaman's bias built in to that statement, the Shaman/SK duo has always
been my favorite.
