The question isn't whether or not people like them so much as whether
or not people think they're an acceptable "price" to pay as part of
the skill.

Sure, but the book also doesn't detail out a long, uneventful run
across half a continent to get from one major city to the next... Of
course, the time frame of the trip in real time in-game is much less,
but, then, so is the time frame for increasing skill in a trade. I'd
say it's a happy medium in between the abbreviation level of a book
and the realistic time investment.

Most avid tradeskillers appreciate the fact that there are areas of
the game that you can skill up in that don't require slaughterfest
methods.

Because wizards don't create their own spells in the world of EQ. The
spells are already created and scribed onto scrolls. All the wizard
has to do is copy the runes into his book. Actual use of the magic
(Read: Killing mobs with it) develops the wizard's understanding of
how the magic works so they can apply it to more advanced spells. The
"suddenly leveling up" isn't so sudden - the skills are gradually
increasing throughout the level. "Dinging" represents a breakpoint, so
to speak, of skill refinement.

In short, it's their representation of a skill that has no real world
equivalent. Their view of it is magic skill is raised more through
active use than study. Only those who actually create spells need lock
themselves in towers. Those wizards are NPCs...
