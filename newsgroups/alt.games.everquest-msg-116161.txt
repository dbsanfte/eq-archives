   I had been playing for about a year before I found out
about /assist.  True, I had been playing mostly casters for
that time, but still, in retrospect I think I should have
stumbled on to it a bit earlier.  Now, whenever I start a
character, its the 2nd thing I hotkey... right after /loc
(which I learned about the very first day I started
playing).  And I use it constantly, no matter which
character I am playing.
    Just MHO, but I think that knowing how to use /assist
correctly is one of the acid tests that separates a newbie
from the mid-level knowledge cut-off.
