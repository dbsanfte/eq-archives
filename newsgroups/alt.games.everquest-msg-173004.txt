"On sunny days, the sky is blue"
Counter example: (sunny day) AND NOT (sky is blue) => False

"In a pickup group of strangers, NBG is a lie"
(Note: "used to..." is not part of the core statement; it is extra
information provided in addition to the core statement. I think that's
where everybody is disagreeing - you're focussing on the "used to..."
part. We're not disagreeing on what hot water is used for, we're
disagreeing that the water is hot... to oversimplify somewhat.)
Counter example: (pickup group of strangers) AND NOT (NBG is a lie)

If we strip the conditionals and make it:
    "NBG is a lie"
do you agree? If not, do you agree that it's true in pickup groups of
strangers? Because that's how the statement (with which we're disagreeing)
reads. The sentence parses as (circumstance) NBG is a lie (explanation).

You did *not* say "NBG is used as a lie..."; that statement is true, there
are cases where NBG *is* used as a lie. You said "NBG is a lie used to..."
which is *false*.

"Blood is red"
does NOT mean "some blood is red", for gossake. It means *all* blood is red.
(Which statement is false AFAIK, but it works as an example.)

If you still disagree... well, we'll have to agree to disagree. Feel free
to flame away.

        ...Ronny
