Hello,

I have exactly the same problem. Reinstalling the game and redownload
the patch did not work, and the file "bmpwad6.s3d" isn't even in the
directory.

I have opened the file "everquest.log" and read that the file
"skins/default/default.xml" was missing. I made a comparison with the
installation of a friend and it seems that the subdirectory "Skins" is
missing, and also the dll win32bitmap.dll. I got these files from the
friend and I could start the patcher, but:
* at start, the patcher says it couldn t parse the xml file.
* it does not download any new file
* when I hit the start button, I can log in, but only 2 servers are up
(the others are "locked"), and when I select a server and hit play I
am disconnected a short time after.

Of course the tech support did not help me.
