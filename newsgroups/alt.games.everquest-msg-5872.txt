Did you do a /who all Seczet?  Sounds like it's a player character name,
and really doesn't sound like a typical EQ system generated NPC message.
Friend or guildmate screwing around with you, perhaps?
   Other than that, it's possible it's part of the zoning message bug you
get in some places.  The place I notice it the most is going from W.
Freeport zoning into East Commons. Upon landing in EC, I constantly get
bizzare messages, including:
"You tried to hit Myrkanie, but you miss!"
"Myrkanie has died."

Now, I have no clue who Myrkanie is, and I certainly wasn't fighting
them.  This happens a lot.  I'm guessing it's just a bug.
