Hi All

I hate the message you are being inspected, strange but I always feel 
its a bit rude for people to be doing it without asking. That said I 
appreciate you can't turn that off. I have heard that there is an ini 
file setting that allows the message to be disabled. i.e they can still 
inspect but I won't know about it. Not a great solution but what I don't 
know won't worry me )

Anyone know what the setting is?

Also is there anywhere that holds a definitive list of all the possible 
inifile settings

Many thanks

Miles
