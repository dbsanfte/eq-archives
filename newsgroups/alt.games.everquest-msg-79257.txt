While I have a personal dislike for the greedy, quad-kiting druid that
has no care for anyone else in a zone, especially those that cannot
handle their pulls, ANYONE that is in a group, and contributing to
that effort, deserves an even and fair split of any and all loot.

Or, looking at your logic, does that mean that, as a Shaman capable of
doing so, I shouldn't be allowed to loot in a group because I can make
pp selling SoW potions?  The Cleric should not be allowed to loot
because he can make pp rez'ing people?  Or any of the other 'support'
classes, for that matter?

That is pure stupidity.  Remember that attitude next time you need a
port, or a SoW, or a quick heal, snare or root to save your rear end.
