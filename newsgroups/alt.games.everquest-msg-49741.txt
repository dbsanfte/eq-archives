My Linux box (Redhat 7.something) dials MSN (imagine that) via pppd
and shares the connection to my local LAN via IP Masquarade (I connect
at 28.8 - 33.6). Performance is fine as long as noone else in the
house is using the Internet. When someone else in the house is also
using the Internet (regular browsing - I'm the only one who plays EQ),
lag is so bad that fighting is out of the question, even baking /
feltching / brewing / smithing are annoyingly slow.
