Unless you are heavily twinked I'd stay away from karnors.  It's been
awhile since I was 42, but for dungeons try

SolB - My favorite place.  Try to get into a king group.

LGuk - Probably bunch of farmers taking all the good spots, you are
about the right lv for a good group though.

Velktors - probably a bit low yet, but probably get picked up for your
mana regen.

CoM entrance - Hard to get a group, usually only a few people there.

Think there's a dungeon in Luclin your lv, Acrilia Caverns or something?

Mistmoor goes up that high, I think it's an awsome XP zone, but these
days definately bring your own group.  Might look into getting an MM
drum as well.

Tower of Frozen Shadow, BYOG again, and everything way underconned, of
course you might be able to charm solo there...
