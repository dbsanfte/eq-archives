    OK, so in reference to group XP grinds.

>We are, however, ABSOLUTELY group-dependant

    No argument. My rogue, not exceptionally twinked but twinked, was able
to kill two kobolds in Sol B solo before the first would re-spawn. And they
were both low blues, too. Without the overkill that is a Fungi Tunic, a
rogue cannot solo with any degree of effiency.

>and probably THE most equipment class

    This, I'm going to put an asterix beside. One word: Ragebringer. Rogues
have available, starting at level 50, a quest considered by guilds to be not
TOO tough (I won't insult you and call it the F name). This quest yields a
weapon that is an endgame weapon for a rogue.  Not having to worry about one
weapon OR haste, and having more lax armour requirements due to Evade (you
need protection, but can afford to let it slide to get something else you
need and still perform what's expected of you) is huge.

>and very low HP (I've got around 1200 at 44th).

    There's a few items out there for HPs, but yeah - rogues tank like
rangers. AC, HPs, defensive skills are very comparable between the two.

    Look for the next SCH to be the Crystalline Spider Fang. The Velk's camp
this comes from is camped 24/7 (on my server guilds have taken to holding it
now), and it drops pretty often. 10/22 3 STR 10 PR and proc: Velium Shards.
The price is already in the 2 K or less range, and should really start to
drop soon.

>This gets compounded by the shopping done

    I might be biased by hunting in Sol B and Lower Guk, but the biggest
twink class I see out there right now is the Monk. Incredibly soloable,
deals a ton of damage, can be given high-quality gear for very low cash
outlay, and has the best safety switch / pause button in the game. And you
get all the cool attack animations. 8)

>In exchange for the dependency on weapons and groups, we get 'sick' damage
>and little other than Sneak-Hide

    Heh. Sneak-Hide is huge. No, bigger than that. Instant speed
better-than-invis, which with current programming CAN be reactivated in time
across a zone line (but not when logging in), and an ability that allows you
to set almost any NPC to Indifferent faction? Speaking of faction, having at
least the Teir'Dal mask available to anyone that sneaks down to Lower Guk
and waits has to also be considered a part of the class - and it is also
pretty damn useful.

>in terms of 'useful' skills (Traps and
>Locks are *rarely* useful, and then only for one click).

    Where locks are located, you get invited. Those areas - upper CoM, Crypt
in Sebilis, Charasis - have bountiful loot. Pick Locks is BETTER than a
wizard's Alter Plane spells, because at least things you want or can sell
are located behind those doors. Traps I agree with, though - traps in game
are mostly annoyances for the rogue to deal with.
