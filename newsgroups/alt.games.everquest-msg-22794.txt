"Black Cat" is an adjective-noun pairing
"Fat Cat" is an adjective-noun pairing
"Feline Cat" although redundant is an adjective-noun pairing
I have no problem accepting nouns used as adjectives when they apply,
I do have a problem accepting synonyms for those same nouns used as
adjectives,
"Kitty Cat" to me is not an adjective-noun pairing. It is merely a double
name, every cat
can be termed a "kitty cat." Even Lions, Tigers, Pumas, etc.
I am not trying to be difficult, I just don't see it, if I am wrong I can
admit to that but
I haven't seen anything to convince me of that yet.

: That's a little naughty.... saying that I claimed,
: "using the Dictionary "is the wrong tool " to define words or parts of
: speech"
:
: I said no such thing.
:
: I said that you used the wrong tool to support your claim, and that is
what
: you did, and that is what DT is doing. The dictionary told you it was a
noun
: and you couldn't see any other use for it. You needed a different tool to
: tell you how it could be used as an adjective.
:
: I note that you have already agreed that a noun can be used as an
adjective,
: now all you have to do is explain the principle to DT, as I (and the
: University of Calgary,) seem unable to.
