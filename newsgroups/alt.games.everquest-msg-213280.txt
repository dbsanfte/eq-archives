It was in the signature.  Considering the reasons for not posting binaries, it
is not clear to me that they apply to signatures.  Indeed, certain binaries are
commonly accepted as OK in signatures, such as digital signatures.

If a signature obeys all the rules about size and encoding, I don't see any
thing wrong with its contents being a binary.

That particular signature was too long, however, so deserves a little flaming.
However, that rule seems to be ignored by many people here.
