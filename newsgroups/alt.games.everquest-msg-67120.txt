Our guild (Consanguinity on Torvo*) decided last night to take a look
at Acrylia Caverns. Other than sending out a preliminary scouting
group to find the place and look around the entrance, we had no
information on the zone other than what is listed on EQAtlas.

Breaking into Acrylia Caverns requires either a fight through Grimling
Forest or a successful invisible sneak through that zone. With a group
that was 52+, we got no aggro, but I'm not sure if invisibility
dropped on anyone.

We brought a single party--level 60 cleric, level 60 bard, level 59
shadowknight, level 57 druid, level 55 necromancer, and level 52
wizard. As soon as we entered the zone, we were within visual contact
of a blue-to-all grimling deathbringer.

The zone appears to be a full society of grimlings. We encountered
warriors, shadowknights, necromancers, wizards and clerics. The shadow
knights harm touch regularly for 461 to 650+ and all grimlings seem to
hit for around 170. The clerics CHeal. Wizards cast Gravity Flux and
one other DD spell I forget. The necros cast disease-based DoTs. The
Shadowknights seem to love harm touching my pets and I lost a half
dozen before giving up.

The reason I'm a little hazy on the details is that, once we started
to move forward, we had to fight for every inch we took. We didn't
pull so much as we waited for the adds. Just about every spawn near
the zone entrance was within aggro range of 3 or 4 others. Within
about half an hour, we had a pile up of five or six and had moved
barely out of site of the entrance, inching forward.

Worse, the repop time in this zone is short--close to 6 minutes or so.
We burned a lot of mana just getting enough forward momentum to be out
of sight of the repops behind us. There was close to zero room for
mistakes, so that even a single mistargetted DoT that I cast almost
forced us to evac to Lavastorm.

If you continue to fight forward, you will eventually find an unlocked
door. There seems to be only a single path up to this point, so you
can't miss it. Behind this door is the first safe spot for meditation
and resting. There appear to be no spawns here and no wanderers.

Shortly beyond this safe hallway is a small town of grimlings plus a
few animated corpses (undead skeletons.) Because of the fast repop
rate, you can't wait in the entrance to town and things are too
compact to try to fight your way in. At this point, we had to port out
because some of the animated corpses can not be mesmerized by a bard,
even a level 60 one.

The grimlings dropped no coin, some of the "new fine steel," some
mid-range gems (flawless aquamarines and black pearls,) level 44 and
49 research components, and tons of the new Luclin runes. I still
don't know what the runes are supposed to be for. (I would check the
name, but I'm writing this during a patch.)

Ultimately, we didn't break very far and never saw any acrylia drop.
Because of the low effort-reward ratio, we probably won't go back
soon. I just wanted to share these notes for others who might want to
explore further.
