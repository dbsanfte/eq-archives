  Hi guys.  I have a question for you.  What is good for damage and delay to
put in a primary hand, and secondary?  I'm usually playing casters so I
haven't played melees that much.  I have a Centi SS and a Symphonic saber
for my bard now.  What's better in what hand?  Centi SS has more damage, but
more delay. Something like 12 / 25 .  Around there.  Symph Saber is 11 23.
I can't proc the symph yet, I've heard that was level 50.  Any suggestions?

-Dakis
