"Greetings All, 
If you are here because you received a spam purporting to be from my
client Jessica Felix or Art and all that Jazz or as the result of a
usenet spam please read this. 

If you are here to look at Jessica's jewelery click here. "

I always wonder what idiots bother to cause trouble for people by
spamming newsgroups, in their name, and what they seek to accomplish?
