yup, the account is non-transferable. If you know anyone that plays, see if
they have one of the 'give this to a friend' free account keys that has been
dumped on peeps this year.

As far as non transferable software, many software EULA's state that you
can't transfer ownership... Your Windows OS among them. You have the right
to sell the computer, but not the right to transfer the OS to someone else,
or move the OS to a different machine.
