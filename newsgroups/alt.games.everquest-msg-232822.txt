following up a few things in this thread...

Hangman's noose seen in bazarre - can that happen with no drops?

Price is entirely dependent on server - got my Flowing Black for 2500 on
Tunare, just missed one way below market at 1200 - was large crowd at that
guy by the time I got there - maybe a loss leader ; )

Check links, find one of several sites with haste details, copy the table
and paste into spread sheet - then Alt-tab between sheet and your bazarre
character to find out what you can get for what -

Agree, do not waste money on really cheap - you will replace the item
anyway -
