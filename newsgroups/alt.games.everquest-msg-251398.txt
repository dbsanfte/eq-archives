Man did you miss the mark on that one...
Games like Unreal and my old favorite Quake are multiplayer.. but you
don't see those players "grouping" :)

Multiplayer = as in MORE THEN ONE can play the game at the same time!!
Thats all it means!!
Multiplayer in NO WAY implies GROUPING!!

And just because its multiplayer doesn't mean the makers of the game
TELL you what you have to do when your playing :)

LOL..they just tell you what you CAN'T do, the rest is up to you!!
