A heal cast while a CHeal is coming is wasted to the degree that there are any
HP left at the moment the CHeal hits.  A heal that hits after the CHeal hits
is wasted to the degree that there are fewer than the heal's HP in damage to
be healed when the heal hits.

On the other hand, a heal that hits before the CHeal hits, such that when the
CHeal hits there is even one point less than that heal's total left over, just
saved
the target's life... unless its so small relative to incoming damage that
despite
the heal hitting in time, the target still dies before the CHeal lands.

The damage absorber seems to me to function almost exactly as a heal
as far as this goes, except that if it hits just after the Cheal goes off you
will still get full benefit.  As long as there is sufficient

If the person would not have died without the buffer of the absorber, and it
landed before the CHeal, then the person did not get any benefit out of it.
The CHeal heals 150 fewer points than it would have otherwise, thats all.

I agree here, problem being that at the level where you get this spell,
mobs that hit for under 150hp aren't all that easy to find, making this
strategy less valuable than it should be.
