That's what makes them so nice, I never once asked for a thing (and maybe
they appreciated THAT and that's why they were nice!).  Last night I was
fighting a rat as hard as I could go, and an upper level player just ran up
to me and dropped a magic sword on me.  I was so happy!  And a lot of the
time when I'm sitting around waiting for my mana to go back up, some nice
upper-level player will see me sitting there and buff the heck out of me.
And before I can say "thank you" they've dashed off.

It's just great that people are so cool.  I LOVE MY BIG BROTHERS!
