I have to agree with Richard.  You want an ENC that can mez the crowd and stand
there for more than 2 rounds when it breaks, especially on plane raids/camp
breaks.  I play both a shaman and an enchanter, the first thing my shaman does
when she joins a group is talisman and stamina the enchanter, then the tanks.
Mezzing, clarity and speed are not that mana intensive (when compared to damage
spells) and it is MUCH more important that the enchanter does not fall into that
"you really close to dead now, I don't care that those three wizzies are ICing
me...".

Just my thoughts from the raids I've been on.
