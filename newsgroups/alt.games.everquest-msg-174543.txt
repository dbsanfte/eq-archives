I recall the last time I talked about PoJ trials, on here with Dearic and
Bergh (they were struggling, i was proclaiming how easy it was)...

Ironically, the next day I was helping a friend get flagged, and we failed.
Np.. clearly bad luck, lets try again..  ok 2 failures, thats bad.. 3
failures.. wtf are we doing wrong.

At that point the warrior (who needed a flag) got pissed, said he'd try some
other time, and left.  The rogue left too, k now we have a problem - the
warr and rogue were replaced with a monk and ranger.

I was now "tank" (monk), next attempt we passed with total ease (the cleric
went LD, and we killed the executioner with a 40m shaman, and a buffless ma
(first wave named fucking dispelled me ^*^*&))

It wasn't a gimpy warrior, he had a BoC, primal, a ton of AA's etc..

I've tanked it a few times since, each time successful on the first
attempt... taunt doesn't matter.. its the shaman who generally tanks anyway
