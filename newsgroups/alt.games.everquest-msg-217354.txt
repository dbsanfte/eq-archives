Everquest 2 questions meet the charter for this newsgroup... and it would be
silly to try and fragment it any further.

I was heavily involved in the rec.arts.anime newsgroup when it splintered
into a bunch of other newsgroups - most of then unnecessary.
rec.arts.anime.fandom? .misc?  .info? .models?  .music?  Bah... it was just
silly, and no one knew which newsgroup to bring up any topic in, and there
were propogation problems.  I still think it remains a mistake to this day.

a.g.e has only moderate traffic, so having EQ2 discussions here is not going
to cause too many problems.

All that aside, you'd be fighting an uphill battle trying to create
alt.games.everquest2.  A few months ago an obnoxious Sullon Zek guy tried to
create an alt.games.everquest.sullonzek and got slammed pretty hard by the
powers that be, much to my satisfaction.  =)
