Hmmm ...extreme run of bad luck on your boyfriend's part, first
running into a title that wasn't filtered, then misinterpreting why
his named was changed the first time. (It's always wise to pay very
close attention when dealing with GMs...)
And you're right, 'guardian' should have been filtered. One thing is
that they can't filter 'the', but what kind of word would you make
with 'guardian'? I'm guessing there are several other title words that
slip through the not-too-efficient filter, and sometimes they assume
that everyone automatically knows why titles shouldn't be used.
However, she did tell your boyfriend the first time and had no way of
knowing he'd missed it, and I suspect they have quite a few cases of
people stirring up shit when they lose a kewld00d name, so I can
understand why she'd bring up suspension when he repeated the offense.

As for not answering... how would you defend the existing, faulty
filter? :)
