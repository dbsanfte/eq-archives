That should be changing when SoE changes what level mobs are still xp 
giving for levels 61+.  There is are at least two camps in PoN that are 
doable to 65 under the current system, grouped, not solo.  PoD Castle 
should be good for 62, maybe 63.  PoI factory, I am unsure about, but, 
should certainly be good for a couple more levels for me, and that is one 
of the flags in tier 1 zones that is doable by a dedicated guild, or group 
of guilds. Justice seems to be the lowest level of the Tier 1 zones, so, 
not surprised about that.
