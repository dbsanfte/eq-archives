Apologies for the double post, Google appears to have some problems
with quoting on a simple reply.

That is an interesting point, but the steady trickle of those returning
seems to suggest that Everquest still has something the others don't.
I would suggest that it has two somethings the others don't and both
are maturity.  First Everquest unlike any of the new games and any of
its contemporaries has a Mature sophisticated challenging end-game.
Second Everquest has a Mature and dedicated community which is enhanced
by the community tools.  On some of the other games I have played,
other players or groups were rarely memorable because teamwork and
co-ordination in a group isn't that important.  In everquest I STILL
find myself making mental notes and sometimes written ones of
outstandingly good or bad players, yes there are still mediocre players
where nothing was particularly memorable, but the exceptional
player(good or bad) appears to not be the exception in everquest. OTOH
my experience, and reports from others are that exceptional players and
groups are truly rare, I'm not sure if this speaks to the game engine
or to the player skill level, but it most certainly speaks to why EQ is
still worth playing.
