Every pet and charm class. You either don't want to take it away from your
pet or you don't want your pet to get it so you can aggro kite. I even do
aggro kiting w/o pets, just have the bard, ranger, whatever, following
behind the mob hitting it. It is pretty much just a two sided coin and both
come up soloing.
