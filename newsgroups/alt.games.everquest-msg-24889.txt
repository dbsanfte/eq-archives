You mention INT bonus but don't bother counting CHA?  What's the total
CHA...it's not like it's unimportant, especially, as you say, you don't
really want to upgrade him for a very long time.

If you know SolA well enough to find Kindle you should know it well enough
to find the bartender.  He's the one that drops drakehide leggings, and it's
his common drop.

And you can do the moggok quest yourself, especially if you have a 29+
druid/wiz friend (druid preferred, due to the closest port location to
Oggok...who wants to port into the middle of CT at level 8?).
