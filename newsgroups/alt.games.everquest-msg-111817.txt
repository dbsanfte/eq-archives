From Test Server:

I think this might explain most of it...

** Thursday, April 11 2002, 11:00 am.


Many, many, many internal changes over the past day. By way of
explanation...

Yesterday marked the first public patch of a massive set of changes that
included a) making the existing EQ Live servers run a whole lot more
efficiently, b) beginning to support EQ being localized to other languages,
as well as c) some foundation work for Planes of Power.

We've completely reworked a number of data storage systems - Characters,
Guilds, and pretty much everything having anything to do with NPCs and their
loot.


As many of you have experienced, it's not necessarily the smoothest road,
but it's gone a *lot* smoother than it might have. Once we get these all
cleaned up, quite a few things will just be working better in general.

One example being: Anyone who's ever disbanded and recreated a guild,
attempted to have one renamed, or tried to create one that was too close in
name to an existing guild, has seen the limitations in our old way of
handling guilds. Those limitations and their frequently occasionally
annoying side effects should be gone now.


As a result of some of the changes to character inventory storage, a few
people who logged in yesterday have had their items with procs break.

People with non-functioning epics, Orbs of Tishan, or other items with
effects that broke as part of our changes - Please make sure to petition for
a trade in. Test is still a non-support server, and we can't promise a
timely reimbursal, but losing some of these larger things is a bit much.
We'll get them fixed up where we can.

Thanks for your patience, and for helping to find quite a few important
bugs. (Sorry - We've already fixed the one that was causing some NPCs to
always drop their rare loot. On the bright side, others were always dropping
their common - That's fixed now, too.)

===================

** Monday, April 1 2002, 11:00 am.


* Internal changes we need to make sure didn't break anything, but things
should behave the same.

- /who all
- Meditation
- Stationary NPCs. If you can make them move or they warp around, that's a
bug.
- Targetting/Looting and: Eyes of Zomm, Familiars, Corpses, Warders.
- A few hundred new strings added to the localization string table.

* Familiars should be able to zone from qcat to qeynos2 with their master.

* NPCs who shout names while they DT should be fixed.

* Skiffs should be working.

* Tinkered compass should truly grant a sense heading boost.

* Random frame lag in guktop, oasis. Believe it or not, it was related to
alligators. (I know -- I had to have it explained to me, too.)

* Rogue hotbutton lockups due to pickpocket/beg should no longer be
possible. The client didn't realize that these two have always used the same
skill timer.

* AA turn summoned should work as described.

* Mage AA reclaim should work with epic pet.

* HP on food items should be taken into account. Be careful how you eat -
You can kill yourself if you run out of bonus food at an inopportune moment!

* Potions should work on horses.

* PC spell filters reworked - Problems with of taking damage without being
able to see it, or the client over-reporting damage taken should be fixed.

* Re-enabled focus items and AAs for clickable items that affect a spell's
duration.

* Dealt with some DS stacking issues.

* Updated all non-pet NPCs to return items they don't care about. Charmed
NPCs will still accept items while they are charmed. (Naturally, the
Rivervale and GFay Priests of Discord are exempt from this rule. ;)

* Fixed a bug in mage QuickSummon AA that was preventing it from affecting
Call of the Hero and Manifest Elements.

* High level NPCs in Cazic Thule should now be tauntable.

* Res boxes being automatically dismissed by other windows.

* /yell and lifetap string problems.
