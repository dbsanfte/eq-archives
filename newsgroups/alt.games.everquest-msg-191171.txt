I've been having this problem lately too. I have a linksys 4 port hub.
My account is fine (only LD maybe once a month or so and I attribute
that to my cable network since both systems dump) but my second pc
will all of a sudden LD. Usually only happens like twice then fine for
the rest of the night and was only say two times a week. 

Last night I couldn't keep my second machine connected period. LD log
back LD log back LD. Rebooted the machine same thing. Wasn't until I
keep my char sitting at char select for a period of time and then
logged in that I had no probs.

Dunno if this is a linksys prob or not.

Also this seems to have only started since I started shutting down my
2nd machine at night (used to leave it run 24/7). Prolly just a
coincedence but figured I'd mention it.
