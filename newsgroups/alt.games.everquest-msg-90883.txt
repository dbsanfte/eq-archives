    Hmm. Get a fully charged Larrikan's Mask on a mule. Sell fully charged
mask to vendor with open inventory slot for 1 gold. Sell empty mask for 1
gold. Buy back fully-charged mask for 1 plat. Have mule buy back fully
charged mask for 1 plat. Total cost for ten charges of invis is less than
two plat. That doesn't beat potions? (And yes, I wish the damn mask wasn't
Lore so I wouldn't need to do the mule shuffle.)
