KEI.  Any buff which will raise your INT or WIS, whichever is higher.  In 
some cases, such as smithing, STR can be used instead of INT or WIS.  Most 
of the tradeskills do not have an alternate stat, so if you are serious 
about tradeskilling, you will want to get yourself a set of tradeskilling 
gear.  In your case as a Paladin, probably wisdom gear.  Raising more than 
one of the stats does not help, only the highest one matters.
