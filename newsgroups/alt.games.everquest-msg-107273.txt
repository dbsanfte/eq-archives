Sorry, perhaps shortening Grimrot later in the post confused you.  I was
not speaking of the goblin in Sol A who is only a slightly annoying
spawn.  I was in fact referring to Grimrot, a much more annoying spawn,
as mentioned earlier in my post.  Ask your best friend if she has done
the AoL quest, she'll fill you in.

As for the rest, care or not, makes no matter to me.  What does matter
to me is someone thinking that they are more important than someone
else.  They aren't, we are all equals even if you are lvl 600 and I am
lvl 1.  For a player to think that they have a right to trample on
someone because they are higher lvl or "need" an item disgusts me.  The
fact that you don't care doesn't change my feelings on the subject, I
hope you'll understand.
