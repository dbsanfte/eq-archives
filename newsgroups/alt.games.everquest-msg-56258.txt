Are there any? Granted, I've only tried a couple casters, and not had
much in the way of head slot armor, but it seems like everything shows
up as the caster being bareheaded.

Ideally, for style if nothing else, I was hoping there was something
with a metallic skullcap graphic, which I think would look very sinister
and in keeping with some of the casters. (*cough* NECRO *cough*) Kind of
like the hat Merlin wore in one of those Arthurian movies. But almost
any sort of s skullcap or hood/cowl would likely be an improvement.
Currently I've got a stone circlet, and it shows up as nothing. Is this
just the standard for human caster headgear?
