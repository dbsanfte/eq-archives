Hmm, why not?  It was easily fixed with some quick killing in Mistmoore.  
I know that I was ally to Gorenaire before I killed her for her hide. (I'm 
such a heartless bastard!)  I suspect that I'm still pretty well regarded 
by her, but haven't seen her up since then.

I strongly doubt it.  As a wood elf bard, I spent a good deal of time in 
GFay (started way before Kunark existed), and I'm sure I've killed a 
number of the bandits there.  I, and everyone else in my guild, was fine 
in Mischief, though killing Stumpy or whatever the rat is DOES give a 
faction hit.  Other than that, faction isn't really a problem in PoM other 
than the puppets.  Too bad they made the zone pretty much useless, I never 
did get my Blam Stick.  Damn scaly monks taking my peck droppings.
