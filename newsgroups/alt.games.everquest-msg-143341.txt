Heh, I'm a Paladin.  The dd+stuns I've got are Holy Might and Force,
plus...  Tishan's Clash (wiz spell, no?) proc when I equip Sword of
the Morning.  If the chromas are immune to stun then either:
a) my brain is older and feebler than yours (very possible), or
b) they've been changed since I fought in Skyfire last spring.
I do recall some of the mobs seeming to not be stunable, tho I can't
recall getting any "...immune..." messages from them, but I coulda
sworn the chromas were stunnable.
