My experience on the FV test server sounds unlike the rest of yours.

Instead of complaining about people talking about everything in shout
and auction the only thing I have to complain about is that no one was
talking, at all, not a bit not a single person.

I made a dark elf cleric and basically one person talked while I got
from level 1 - 6 going through various zones over about 5 hours. I
know the people in nektulous were dark elves but making perfectly
valid shouts like

/shout does anyone know if the missing tailoring patterns like bracer,
cloak and such are sold in neriak?(Later in reading EQ traders it
seems only choice as a beginning dark elf to make that missing
patchwork is to go to the feeroot and get from the vendors there, or
go to the overthere zone.. I think overthere via the boat at level 5
and gating back would actually be easier than the feeroot. Once again,
you can't even communicate with any of the players who could shop from
spoolie gee to have them buy the patterns for you = / )

got no responses at all, not even a "no."

It seemed like the entire server in the areas I played, with as many
as 25 people in a zone, were very very shy. Even going into east
commons I saw no chatter from the humans at all or in freeport.

The funny thing is I see more roleplaying on my regular server
tribunal in 10 minutes than I saw on this server in 6 hours. So what
the heck is the point?

The one person I did see talking was a troll in auction in freeport
east, he was saying

/auction in an unknown tongue "dfd afeney bimg?"

/auction in an unknown tongue "fdff e knore fjkjdfdl rer imbd"

Obviously he was asking for a bind, but of course no one could
understand him including my dark elf.  As a dark elf I had Dark elf as
my only language and human common or just "human" as the only other
one I could train. This made me think even more what is the point?
Obviously everyone will just train human at 5 points per level until
they can speak to each other in it.

 Another odd thing Is I had elder elvish as a selectable language but
I guess its at zero and there is no option to train it. I talked to a
wood elf in it asking if they could understand me and that I was
talking in elder elvish, they said something to me in an uknown tonuge
then made a gesture I could not make out or something. Evidently what
I heard about being able to see smiles and waves and such is not true
because it said something like that around me all the time when
someone obviously had gestured something. 

In my six hours I got even more the idea that this is basically the
"xenophobic quiet harder ruleset non pvp" server. I saw zero
roleplaying or interaction amongst players of any kind, so I can't
judge how much of that is going on since basically I saw no
communication at all. I even checked to make sure all my channels were
on and they were.

The alignments also seem pretty bad or maybe I've not figured them
out. It seems to me that some classes and races like wood elf druid or
barbarian shaman will get to be neutral so they can get to group with
anyone (and presumeably guild with anyone) while others like my cleric
dark elf are limited to 3 evil ones which I guess means I can only
group with Evil and neutral? I'm still not exactly clear on this. So
really to be in the best place on this server you'd want to be a
neutral chracter like a barb shaman or some kind of druid.

Evidently a gnome enchanter could cast on my dark elf cleric, so he
must have been neutral I guess. Which brings up something else I don't
get .. if  a neutral starts a guild can only neutral join? If not and
evils joined then could goods join? Would it be decided by whichever
joined, good or evil first? If there is an evil guild or good guild
presumebly neutrals could join. Although they go to great lengths to
tell me that dark elves are mostly ordered evil (duhhh.. like lawful
evil in Ad and D, which dark elves always seemed like to me) they
really don't explain anything about the guild types or exactly what
other alignments you can group with or be in a guild with. 

I guess they'll explain more when the server is live but so far it
seems puzzling. Being either Evil or Good seems like it could box you
into a corner as far as guilds go in the eventual life of the server.
like oh you want to do ToV but the only guild that can do it is all
evil or all good.. or possibly even all neutral if that is a concern.
It seems like the safest place to be would therefore be a neutral
character.
