In Seattle for a couple of weeks visiting family, so this is being sent
under my father's account:

Two things:  not a lot of people having banes, and us not knowing how to
deal with Emp's de-aggro proc.  That Emp we truly zerged, as we had to keep
rezzing tanks and sending them back in to fight.

This time we had a couple more banes - not a lot more - but, most
importantly, we'd figured out how to handle the proc.  The first main tank
died when Emp was under 50% and we switched to the second, who stayed up the
rest of the way.  Amazing how keeping your MT alive can make all the
difference.  =)

Er, we didn't "blow the emp spawn"... it would be available again in four
hours.  It's not like AoW, where a failed attempt would prevent it from
respawning for another week.  And Blood *does* drop really nice loot for us,
still.

Basically, we half-expected to lose the race to Emp, and we at least wanted
the Blood loot.  So we grabbed Blood while we had the numbers and the
uber-guild did not.

> I think your raid leaders made a bad call that day.

Maybe.  There were a couple of people who were unhappy with the call to take
Blood.  It wasn't our intent to blow the spawn for the uber-guild; really,
all we wanted was the Blood loot.  But I agree that it *looks* like we were
attempting to keep the uber-guild from getting Emp before we could get more
numbers on.  And appearance means a lot when it comes to your reputation.

The chanters *were* dying.  We had to tank-mez while we killed Blood, then
award loot and TL the heck out of the area.  I daresay if Blood hadn't
dropped as quickly as he did, we would have wiped.  As it was, we had to
leave a few corpses behind to be summoned later.  That would not have been
necessary if they hadn't been breaking our mezzes.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the uber-guild was filling /ooc and
/shout with taunts.  They fully admitted to what they were doing, and were
derisive of us and our abilities to handle the broken mezzes.  I'm sure that
the /ooc stuff played a large factor in the GM's decision.

Hmm.  Guess we have to disagree here.  This was the third time we've killed
Blood, then TL'd out of the area before Emp spawned.  This was the first
time we killed Blood while there was contention for the Emp spawn, however.

But do keep in mind that Blood drops some nice loot (for us, anyway) and
that he's a legitimate target just by himself.

> Why would the other guild not get the next attempt?  Seems like the
> fair comprimise to me

I am fairly certain that if the uber-guild had not broken our mezzes, not
stolen our triggered spawn, and not acted like children in /ooc, then the GM
would have awarded them the Emp spawn.  Unfortunatley, the uber-guild
reacted in the worst possible way.  Their guild leader even posted on the
Drinal flame boards, saying that his guild deserved to be TL'd out of the
zone for the way they were acting.

The uber-guild has had its own way for *so* long that, when faced with
competition for a spawn they wanted, they forgot how to act.  Emp was theirs
by divine right, and because they had the mandate of heaven, they could act
however they wanted to without repercussion.  That their actions had actual
consequences came as a great surprise to them.  I think they've learned a
lesson.  They've agreed to a rotation with us for Emp - which was a nice and
honorable thing for them to do.

I'm hoping our alliance and the uber-guild can continue forward, finding a
way to share content so that everyone can enjoy the game.  I'm not hopeful,
however.

We started by killing a taskmaster.  They killed a taskmaster and one of the
named mobs.  We killed the other named mob and the rest of the taskmasters.
After we killed the last of the mobs, Glyphed spawned.  They had people
waiting on the spawn point to gank him.  And again, /ooc was filled with
taunts from them, telling us what they were doing and saying that it was
payback for killing Blood.

It's hard to interpret their actions as honorable when they were shouting at
us with their exact intentions and laughing at us for our inability to
defend our own spawn.

> What exactly did the other guild do?

See above.  =)

> the other guild got screwed with that kind of gm resolution.

While I agree that the GM should have made more of an effort to get their
side of the story before he TL'd them out of the zone, do remember the /ooc
and /shout that filled the air.  The uber-guild was continually taunting us
and making it very clear what they were doing.  He almost didn't have to ask
them what their intentions were - they were making it quite apparent
themselves.

In my more cynical moments, I wonder if *that's* why the uber-guild
leadership agreed to a rotation - because they can't control their members'
behavior during a race to the spawn.  I try *not* to be cynical, however,
and I try to work under the assumption that the uber-guild it legitimately
interested in working out this situation to everyone's best advantage.

Yup - and *that* caused quite a controversy.  On this one issue, though, I'm
with them - if the script is there, why not activate it?  They are under no
obligation not to trigger a scripted event.  Don't blame them, blame Verant
for coming up with a script that would cut off access to some highly
desirable loot.  And, as it turned out, SOE eventually did respond by
creating a new ST with primal restored.

Right now, the "F**K CT/WL and the GM they rode in on!!" thread on the
Drinal flame boards already has more views and will shortly have more posts
than the thread that spawned when the uber-guild awoke the Sleeper.

Aye, I think we're going to do that next time, or use the strategy James
talked about.  To be honest, I was surprised when the CC people said they
were about to kill their mobs - seemed like a mistake to me.  Lesson
learned, and we'll do it better next time.

Thanks.  :)

Don't think we're ever gonna bother with Seru.  Aten, though, is definitely
in our scopes.  Ever since we killed Emp, we've had a frantic scrambling for
shards.  I managed to get six shards just this past weekend, and I already
have a frame, orb, and planar rift.  All I need is the ME shard - a darned
annoying camp, to be certain.

For a while, we vacillated between progressing in PoP and trying for VT.  I
think for the moment we're focusing on VT.  The loot there is awfully nice.

Yes, it is.  =)  We're still feeling all tingly about it.

Hehehe, true that.  =)

Thanks for the responses, Martin.  Definitely food for thought.
