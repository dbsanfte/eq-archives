300 per hit?  The most I've gotten a dire charmed pet to hit for was 149 (in 
any number of zones, though I've never tried in Air), not counting 
double-attack, dual wield or anything else this consummate finger-wiggler 
ignores as irrelevant. :)

In regards to Biz's original post; you're DCing as opposed to your bear with 
50 (or so) hp, right?  I don't know how much damage they do, but I find it 
hard to believe they do more damage than even the 149hp a DC pet does.  It 
certainly does much more damage than my enc animation (I don't have the 
level 66+ one though).

There are certainly more important AAs, though.
