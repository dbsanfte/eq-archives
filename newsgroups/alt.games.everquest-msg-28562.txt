   So, um, exactly how much of this did you make up, Bat Child?
I'd heard of the "engrams" and "auditing" before, and even 
something about the alien ghosts.  But the above paragraph...I
mean...come on now.  Even assuming that L Ron didn't really 
mention DC-8 planes and a big movie theater filled with undead,
and used more mystic sounding vocabulary, even so...how could
anyone believe any of this even for a second?
    Sounds like a plot of a very bad "b" movie from the '50's.
