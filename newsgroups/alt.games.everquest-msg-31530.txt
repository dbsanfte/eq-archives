The lewd behavior law also exists with reason.  It prevents people from
eposing themselves in public places in front of children.  But like the
naming policy, there are times when the law should be enforced, and times
that it shouldn't.  I see the point to prtitioning a vulgar name, but
reporting someone for a name like Lostme Marbles, is petty and stupid.

The point is, you said, it's a rule, you have to follow it, and If I see you
break it, I'll report you. All I did was give you an example of when such a
thing is rediculous to do, sorry if you coulnd't handle it.
