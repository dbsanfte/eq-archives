My first thoughts about this were that they were just roleplaying -
preventing a traitor turning from Qeynos to Freeport.  But if you
really look at it they are killing creatures that the Freeport
administration want killed.  i.e. they are furthering the cause of
Freeport.

Either way, its a bit low taking out an important quest mob that is of
no use to you.  And they are supposed to be the good guys!  From a
roleplay perspective you could almost justify the evil Freeportians
doing the same thing on the Qeynos side.  Killing someone AND hindering
a traitor to Freeport.
