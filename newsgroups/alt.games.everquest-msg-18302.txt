I agree with that 100%, and don't mind having only 8
spell gems for "ready to go" spells.

HOWEVER...

During downtime, when buffing, it seems nothing more than
a time-waster to have to swap buffs into the spell gems,
fire them, then remem the original spell (or more buffs, repeat).
It's empty busy-work.  click, click, click, click, click.

There's no "strategy" in shuffling buffs every time they
need refreshed or someone wants a buff.

What I'd like to see is the ability to fire buffs (and
ONLY buffs) directly from the spellbook (RP: you open your
book and read the spell directly out of it as you cast it,
you don't need to memorize it because you won't be needing
to speak it later at a moment's notice, it's a one-shot thing).

Either that, or a separate bank of buff-only spell gems.

For balance, and to prevent abuse, reading it straight
from the spellbook could have an extra-long cast time,
and be interrupted instantly by any interruption whatsoever
(so it'd be useless in combat).  Maybe the recipient would
have be sitting at the time, to prevent buffing during
fights.
