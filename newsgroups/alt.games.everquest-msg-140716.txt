Another use for this spell is to prevent players from taking faction
hits. I was in an icewell keep raid, and some folks had good faction
there that they wanted to keep. Just before the mob died, the cleric
would atone, so these folks could avoid the faction hit, but still
contribute to the fight. Of course, they didn't get exp either, but
they weren't there for that anyway, so it was cool.
