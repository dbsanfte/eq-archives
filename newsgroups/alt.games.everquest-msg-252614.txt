See my latest posting "Thank you to all you lamers...".
I spent levels 34 to 38 mostly soloing in SB mountains,
sent several tells to Druids and Rangers,if they want to join
me,but no,they prefere to stay in DSP.
My main is Ranger,I remember well what he was capable
of at those levels in SBM;imagine a Ranger and the Enc pet,
both hasted,hitting the mobs from behind, I think would
at most take 2 hours for 1 level with zero downtime.
