On DSL I'm still facing over 4 hours of download.

I didn't do partial downloads as the day progressed, while you did do one.

Right up until the patch is "over" they are still monkeying around with 
it, changing stuff, uploading more stuff, and so on.

If it weren't for the fact that roughly 100,000 people just logged on at 
the time of server up, like me, the remaining little bits of download 
you still have to patch would probably have taken you five minutes... 
thank your lucky stars its 40!

Oh, at one point my download time went over 25 hours.  I hit cancel, and 
then hit download again.  Apparantly it had become hung on the file it 
was working on, because after the kick in the pants, it settled back 
down to a mere 3 hours predicted time.

The predicted time is also a lie, by the way, as its now down to under 2 
hours... clearly their estimating algorithms leave a lot to be desired, 
similar to how your withholding rate rarely comes close to matching your 
actual tax due if your income fluctuates from week to week.
