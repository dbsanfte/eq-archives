	There are two more points of damage bonus to be had, one at 61 and one at
65.  I have seen no evidence that Rangers get a new damage table anywhere in
post-60 advancement.

	He will do slightly more damage than he was doing at 60, if he is using
the same weapons.  As always, virtually all improvement in fighters is done
through equipment.

	He'll have a larger mana pool, he'll med faster...looks good to me.
