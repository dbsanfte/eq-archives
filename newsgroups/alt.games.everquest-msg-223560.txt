They are harder, but none of them is exactly hard and become
rediculously easy with a slower.

The next thing you'll learn is that the poj exit is one of the most
boring places to exp in EQ. :-)

Btw the prisoners are single pullable using normal pulling methods at
55. Sralm the lizard monk is still dark blue to 64 I believe, though,
so when he's up he adds onto the pull. However you can always get
guaranteed singles no matter what level you are using taunt pulling.

The elemental planes are tier 4. BoT, HoH, and Sol Ro (and torment?
Like everyone else I never go there) are tier 3.

The elemental flag mobs are pretty rowdy, especially the rallos zek
event. They take a guild that has dedicated itself to getting properly
geared up to do. For most guilds that meant hard farming of Vex Thal
especially, and that takes quite a bit of time (hell just the key camp
takes quite a bit of time).

But be glad - at least you do it on a server with elemental upgrades
available. On test there is only one alliance that's gotten to
elementals and they've made the decision to disallow any loot from it
from leaving its members. So the next two guilds/alliances on the
chain have to do it the same way as other server's first guilds -
ornate and VT loot at best. Given Test's other difficulties (and they
are *major*) that has slowed us down really really badly - we didn't
have the pick of the litter to start out with like TSF did. :-p

You were running to cazic thule in feerrott and went into the spectre
cave. The entrance to the plane of fear is in there, yes.

They're not just accessable, they're more or less grouping zones now.
Wizards solo in Hate. But there's not a whole lot of point. The loot
has been utterly devalued.

You do realize I'm still reading here, right? :-p
