My partner and I were fighting lizzies in the Feerot near Cazic Thule and
had just finished 4 of them off and had about 2 bubs left... so we parked
our cheeks near the river to rest up.  Out of the blue, we see another PC
fall off a temple with 2 lizzies on his a**.  I get up and pull one of him
with a spell, and my partner and I finish him off... The PC died in the
battle with his lizzie and it turned on us... We barely squeeked by but
managed to kill it.

A few minutes later we are getting some tells on how we didn't help him...
yada yada yada.  He comes back to loot his corpse and then takes off hunting
again.  We are all in the general area together and he trains a spectre that
easily wipes him out.  It then turns on us... so I bolt for the zone while
my buddy goes the other way.  Needless to say it follows me and wipes me out
in a snap.

I come back and yap at him that he trained a spectre on us and he says, well
you didn't help me anyway.  We explain that we were on death's doorstep when
we found him and were in no shape to split up to take down his 2 lizzies.
He explains that the spectre was trained on him by another PC and he didn't
have a chance.  We all felt it was water under the bridge and come to find
out we all wanted to get a group together to hunt orcs in So Ro and we were
all within 1 level of each other... Needless to say we found the perfect
group to do that... and it didn't involve any tells  ;-)
