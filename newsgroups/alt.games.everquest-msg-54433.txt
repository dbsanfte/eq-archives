Sorry, but climbing into a gnome suit when being a troll dont fool us in here.

Then your playign the wrong chars. Several chars can solo, can easily log in
just to play ï¿½ hour.

Oh, forgot the american problem with most people becoming more and more stupid,
stopping to buy adventure and roleplay games because all they care about it
shooting stuff.
Well, at least we now got a good example on how life is at the end of that
downwarding tunnel.

How can you focus on your homework if you play on the football team and
constantly think of football?

1 question: If you have a job and play EQ 2 hours a day after work, or watch TV
2 hours a day after work, how do that change your financial situation?
If you choose to go see a movie 1 time a month you will pay the same as for EQ,
but only get 90 min of entertainment instead of a few hours every day.

Your gonna get a problem when you get old enough to get to college. the work
there take a big part of your free time, which in your world appearantly is a
negative impact on your free time.
Same with a job, also take free time.

Good luck with your future i say.
