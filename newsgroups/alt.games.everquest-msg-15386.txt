I think many people would have to lift the lapel and look at the tag.  I 
could tell whether it is a nice suit, or well-tailored, but personally, I 
don't spend enough time reading GQ.  

Similarly, I can tell a Green Silk Drape from a Blackened Crystalline Robe 
without even having to inspect someone.  If you're supposed to be able to 
tell the difference, the graphic would be sufficiently different to allow 
that.  

}What it all comes down to is that you are whining about someone performing
}an in game function that cannot possibly harm you.  Turn off the message
}(which I wish was never there to begin with) and get over it.

I believe whether it can harm me is not at issue.  The issue is whether it 
annoys me, which it does.  And it would annoy me independently of whether 
or not I saw the silly message.  The difference would be that I'd have to 
save up my annoyance until the inspector actually comments on my stuff.  
And I'd have to wonder why this guy came up, stood stock still in front of 
me, and stared at me.

You keep insisting that I 'just get over' people inspecting me without 
asking me... Why can't _you_ 'just get over' the fact that it bugs me?  
If you don't care about my feelings, go ahead, inspect me without asking.  
The fact you keep telling me to 'just get over it' suggests in a 
backhanded way that you want to (a) care about my feelings and (b) do 
things that piss me off anyway.  Well guess what?  You can't have both.  
So just get over it.
