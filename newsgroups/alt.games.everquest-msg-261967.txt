I wouldn't mind seeing the specific number, but I also don't mind
just getting the "range" by /conning NPCs.  I do wish I could get
a better indication of how big a change I get from kills and quests.
That is, I'd like to be able to tell if a given kill or turn-in is
more effective than another, or at least have ranges:

Your faction standing with Storm Reapers got much better.
Your faction standing with Merchants of Rivervale got better.
Your faction standing with Dreadguard Outer got slightly worse.

But what I'd REALLY REALLY like is to have some way of finding out
what faction an NPC is on.  The only way I know of is to kill the
NPC, which has two drawbacks: (1) I might not be able to, and (2)
killing the NPC is dumb if my goal is to raise faction with it.
The only solutions I know are either to generate a throwaway
character and PL it to uber levels so I can kill most NPCs and not
care about this character's factions (yeah, right), or go to Alla's
and hope somebody else has done that and reported the faction hits.

Why oh why can't I send a different, inoffensive PC up to the NPC
and do something to find out what faction the NPC is on?

(Actually, I think some NPCs might give clues in their color text;
e.g., "Another victory for the Legion of Cabilis!"  But not all.)

I ran into a particularly annoying case recently while trying to
max out my faction with the Order of Three (Qeynos caster guilds)
for my Iksar.  Having gotten up to Kindly with them, I was about
to do some more turn-ins to Unsar Koldhagon when I found myself
getting pounded on by D`mitrious Irska.  I feigned barely in time.
Checking him out later, I found he's another Enchanter GM, but for
some reason he's still Scowling even though the other Enchanter GMs
love me.  I looked again later with my halfling druid and found the
other GMs were indifferent to me but Irska is Amiable.  WTF?  He's
not listed on Alla's.  How am I supposed to figure out why he hates
my Iksar?  (My only guess is that he got teased a lot when he was
growing up, for having a name that's an anagram of Iksar.)
