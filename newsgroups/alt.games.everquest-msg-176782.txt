    What farming? I bought all my supplies for post-158 in The Bazaar. All.
Of. Them. Tedious clicking? What part of EQ DOESN'T have "tedious clicking"?
;-) Time would be a factor if I did these things when I could have been
grouped for XP, but it was mostly done when no guild groups were available.
I don't have an army of bots to PL me, and I solo poorly. And there's no
frustration when you see some of the things you can make, and actually make
one. Putting a 15 CHA/ 10 INT hat on my Bazaar mule ENC was very, very
satisfying.

    Now, I'll freely admit I cheated a little bit. I have the Shears off
Shei, with their +15% Tailoring mod. So not only did I only have to go to
219 or so to have max effective skill (I'm 220 now), but I was able to power
from 194 to 212 in one three hour session with a friend brewing the curing
agent I required. But for the hardest two tradeskills, Tailoring and
Smithing, that shortcut does exist.

    Only if you're there and ready when a "big thing" comes around. The few
people on my server that were GM smiths, tailors, and potters made as much
cash as they wanted when the Earring of the Solstice quest came out. Day to
day, the earnings aren't there unless you work at gathering components. Same
as camping items for sale, really.
