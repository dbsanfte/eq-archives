This is mostly for Sanjian, TwoHead and all the others who have been 
deprived of forteantimes.com for the last few weeks... Apparently, their 
former hosting service wanted to keep the domain name to themselves and 
lots of DNS nastiness ensued.

Anyway, forteantimes.com seems to be working, but if it still hasn't 
propagated to your ISP, try forteantimes.co.uk or else

Enjoy!
