This is totally true. I've done L65 guild groups with my cleric and
they're trivially easy, and done pickup groups with my 64 (now 65 yay
me) rogue twink and they are identical in mob hp, mob dmg, etc. I've
been playing my rogue more lately because frankly my cleric could sleep
walk through the normal 65 missions and I can't find anyone who wants to
do hard ones because of the piss poor extra reward for them.
