Wanted to pass along what I did to rid myself of this persistant problem.

Ok since the new UI I have experienced very choppy video after about 30-60
minutes of play. Needless to say this was driving me crazy. But since the
new UI many "old" zones I have played became almost impossible! I starting
to think maybe there was a memory leak only because of the amount of time it
would take before the *really choppy* video started. (Don't confused this
with Internet lag, or HD loading, because that was all good, that is, no HD
loading during "choppy video" and good connection numbers the whole time.)

I have a P3-866, GeForce2 MMX 400 (64MB), 384MB RAM and a 40GB HD so EQ
performance should  be and was okay.  Many of the "intensive" zones (EJ, TT,
BW, Bazaar, ShadowHaven, etc.) always gave me some amount of choppy video,
enough so that it would make follow a group or keeling mobs difficult to
manage and sometimes impossible, but the new UI seemed to *completely kick
my ass*.

I sent off a request for help to Verrant Technical Support in hopes that I
just had something misconfigured, but before I got past e-mail number two, I
solved the problem.

After a quick review of my OS settings (Win2k), I saw I had the Swap File
size set *way* beyond the amount of RAM I had on the system! Doh! Needless
to say, once I resized it to my maximum RAM size (384MB) EQ has been
performing like a champ! Even my "imfamous zones" now work perfectly!!
Woohoo!!

Now only the damned bizaar (ugh) causes my PC to have epilepsy, but atleast
I can move around and even buy items now.
