1. the tackle box is only a 4 slot container!  I have to sacrifice
FOUR inventory slots to own one.  Should be 8 slot large, like a large
sewing kit.

2. lures are EXPENSIVE to make (couple of silver) unless you go bash
the wasps, bats, rats, spiderlings, etc. yourself. If you loose the
lure when you catch a fish (haven't tried fishing with a lure yet)
then the sale of the fish caught will not make up the loss.  There
should only be a small chance of losing a lure when you catch a fish.

3.  Hooks and tackle boxes are only sold in really out of the way
places.

You really have to want to make a large effort and suffer great
expense and sacrifice in order to do high-end fishing.  Hey, this
models real life to a remarkable degree!
