| If you don't finish zoning by about 4x your usual zoning time (if it takes
| you 30 seconds to zone normally, give it 120 seconds) that means the game
is
| locked up.  If you have Win2k/XP you can hit Alt-Ctrl-Del and cancel
EQ...if
| you're using something else, I've almost always found it necessary to hit
| the Reset button on my computer.

| The problem you're having is that Verant can't freaking write zoning
| code...I've been having trouble getting into most Velious zones (if I can
| zone 10 times in a row...well, I can't finish that sentence, I've never
| zoned more than 6 times in a row), and certainly Shadowhaven.  I think
| that's the only zone in THIS expansion that regularly trashes me.

For me that would be Sanctus Seru.  9 times out of ten the client completely
goes out to lunch during that zone and better yet, my dial-up connection,
once back to Windows, is lit up bidirectionally and will allow no other
traffic (read DNS errors trying to open a web browser, email, etc.) until
it's done doing whatever.

No amount of tweaking aside from running no Luclin PC models and low quality
graphics, will allow me to reenter the zone when it's behaving like that.
Ironically, I never see more than a pinch of players in there if anyone at
all.
