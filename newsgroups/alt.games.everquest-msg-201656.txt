"Well, back on topic... 


I went onto test for a few to play with the spell memmin changes (and to 
finnaly play with /testbuff, that's a trip :p It took me what seems like 
(and could be) a year to get my first character to 25). 

I gotta say it... kudos to SoE on that one. I did it with a wizard because 
I don't really know what spell is what. I was able to very quickly mem my 
spells. 

When you go through the list and select a spell to mem, it will sit you 
down, open your spellbook, mem and stand you back up again immediately. 

When you change your favorites, it will automatically unmem all spells that 
will be changed and sit down and mem em all for you back to back, much 
faster than you ever could by yourself. some examples: 

spell1 
spell2 
spell3 
spell4 
empty 
spell6 
spell7 
spell8 

is saved to 'list 1' 

spell12 
spell13 
spell14 
empty 
empty 
empty 
spell7 
spell8 

is saved to 'list 2' 

if you went from list 1 to list 2, only 3 spell sill need to be memmed, and 
only 3 are memmed. it would have been so easy for SoE to just unmem 
evrything and re-mem wether you needed to or not. anyway, the new one woul 
be: 

spell12 
spell13 
spell14 
spell4 
empty 
spell6 
spell7 
spell8 

which is good. 

On the menu's for finding the spells, the same spell can be listed under 
multiple categories. I was on a test druid to test the DoT messages and I 
noticed that charm animals was both under detrimentl utilities -> animals -
> charm animal but also under detrimental utilities -> charm -> charm 
animal. 

My only gripe with that is AE's aren't listed as ae, rather the color of th 
text reflects the color of the AE spell gems. they're listed as direct 
damage -> fire/cold/magic/summoned/animal/etc -> "65 Sun Vortex" or 
whatever.. you get the point. 

DoT messages are pretty cool, too. You can see a little more on how dots 
work. For instance, all the dots do their damage on the same tick. I tested 
this on some greenie in gfay. I casted one dot that did 23 damage for two 
ticks first, then casted another dot on top of it that did 11. The damage 
reports came up at the same time every time, as well as the health bar of 
the mob. 

Best part is, you get the message "you try to hit a xxxxxx but miss" "you 
have slain xxxxxx"  

Spell descriptions are pretty good, too. the descriptions are also on spell 
scrolls in case you were wondering. 

Some examples: 

Spell: Halo of Light 


Spell Effect: Focuses magical energy into a halo that provides a light when 
worn 


Spell: Levitate 


Spell Effect: Forms a cloud of dense air aroud your feet, Allowing you to 
float slightly off the ground for 0:20:30 consuming a bat wing when cast. 

So, for you RP enthusiasts, it has a nice "in-character" description, while 
also giving you sufficient information about the spell. 

MY only gripe about that is it doesn't say how many hps and stuff buffs 
give, just that it does give hps and stuff.
