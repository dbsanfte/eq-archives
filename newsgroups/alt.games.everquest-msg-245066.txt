/agree high

We can all find disadvantages with every class. Many people play a monk 
or paladin, for example, because they like the character, not because 
they parse out at a certain level. Good grief, get your head out of the 
math and try to enjoy the game a bit. :P

However, you did qualify that this was from the perspective of the high-
end game, though. Maybe it gets to be more of a picking of nits at that 
level. I wouldn't know yet. Your post just had a bit of a depressing 
tone. /shrug
