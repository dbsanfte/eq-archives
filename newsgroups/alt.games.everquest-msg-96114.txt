Ok, here are some answers for you...

Spirit of Wolf starts at 34% speed and goes up to 55% -- starting at 14th
level and goes up 1% per level so it hits 55% at 35th level.

Pack Spirit does the same -- starting at 39th level and caps off at 50th
level.

SoW costs 40 mana.  Pack Spirit costs 120 mana so is more mana efficient in
groups if the lower speed is acceptable until 50th level when they balance.

By the time the Druid gets Pack spirit (34% haste), his SoW spell is faster
and they don't even out until 50th level.

As for how "cheap" 40 mana is you need to put that in perspective.

Ensnare costs 35 mana and lasts for 10 minutes.
Engorging Roots costs 80 mana (39th level Root spell).
Ro's Fiery Sundering costs 50 mana -- AC and Fire Debuff (39th level again).

etc...

Some druids are more sensitive to mana than others are (bull.  that's like
an enchanter claiming only they and the cleric need clarity vs any other
casters in the group).

Others just want the folks who need SoW the most to have it (brain dead
druid there).

The majority are just to stupid to think "gee, if it hits the fan others
will need to run too" -or- so self centered as to believe the rest of the
group is expendable vs them (you ain't got SoW then you can't keep up if we
have to run and the critters will stop to kill you first).

Any way you look at it, if the group is in an area where SoW is needed then
either the Druid or Shaman should see to it.  If not then put that bonehead
on notice and/or dump them.

No idea but if a mage insists on an earth pet in a situation where an earth
pet shouldn't be, one of us would be LFG pertty fast -- If my group, he
would get bounced.  If not my group, then the group would decide who goes
but earth pets when Fear Kiting or using Snare for end of fight, etc...  are
not the smart selection and cause more work for the group than they are
worth.

Shaman pets are lower level than they are (like almost all pets are) and can
aggro adds in some areas.

As for other reasons, a shaman may have 2 banks of hot keys.  1 for with pet
(bunch of pet commands loaded on keys) and 1 for without a pet.  You may be
a fast typer but a lot of folks aren't so /ASSIST followed by /PET ATTACK,
backoff, etc... may take time that is better spent with other activities
(say targeting then healing or buffing, or can for mana, etc...).

LFG doesn't work that way and can be spotted across zones.

AFK is a nicety is all.  As soon as someone does a /tell they know you are
AFK.  If they stand there talking for a bit without a tell then bummer.

IMHO there are a lot of other things far more important to me than seeing an
AFK tag (which I really don't care about as a tell will get you the AFK
message from any zone).

Hope this helps a bit.
