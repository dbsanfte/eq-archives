Actually its not your mana (to do whaever you want with) when you're
grouped. if someone cant deliver the buffs they are supposed to be
delivering, then its time to find a replacement. I dont want to ask for sow
and be told I cant have it because he needs it to nuke/dot/cast thorns.

Of course when people start asking for buffs they shouldnt be asking for (as
is the case here), then its perhaps time to think about replacing them. If
they refuse to learn, then its definitly time to replace them.
