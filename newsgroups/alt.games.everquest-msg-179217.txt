I dont think soloing is a bed of roses using charm pets (for chanter) but it
doent take a rocket scientist either.

Using a bot chanter (whilst also playing the groups tank, puller, and
shaman) I kept all my group alive, and my pet, the entire night.   This was
with the chanter on computer # 3..  not even a keyboard or mouse (laptop)

If some mobs are unrootable, guess what don't pull them.  I generally avoid
the mobs that mitigate slow...  I avoid the mobs who quad for 900, etc...
so as a solo enchanter, skipping certain types of mobs isnt asking too much.

And with 2ish second ae mez, the dangers are slightly less than your making
out..  of course spells can fizzle or be resisted, but hey so can slow.. a
cleric can fizzle my cheal 4 times in a row-shit happens
