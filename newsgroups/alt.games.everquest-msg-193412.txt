Depends on whether or not you have the Luclin models turned on and
whether you go into the zones for Luclin, PoP, or LoY.
Oldworld-Velious, you're fine on a 16MB card. Anything SoL or beyond,
you need a 64MB card (Just like the system req's say).

Dunno about that, really. Mine's playable with a 64MB card. But my
system's also half yours CPU-wise and only has 384MB RAM.
