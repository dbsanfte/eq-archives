	It is not "just plain dumb".

	It is COMPLETELY UNAVOIDABLE when dealing with tradeable items with no
level caps.

	Imagine that you're one of the first-wave EQ players.  You're one of the
first guys to get out of the newbie zones.  You start killing mobs and you get
some new items -- say, a Dervish Cutthroat Ring, or a Mino Axe.  Well, you
don't have any rings, and you're still using rusty or tarnished weapons, so
you're going to wear the rings and wield the axes.  Obviously this means the
stuff is good at the level you got it.

	Then you get more rings and axes.  You and your group have all you can
use, so what to do with them?  You can't sell them to people your level, if
there are any, because they can get their own.  The vendor prices are abysmal.
So you sell them to lower-level players.  When they level up, and start
killing Dervs or Minos, the stuff isn't special to them any more.  They've
been using it for ages now.  By the time you and your friends are getting the
first SSoY or FBSS on the server, Dervish Cutthroat Rings and Mino Axes aren't
even worth giving to newbs any more -- the newbs have better.

	The only things designers can do to stop this is either make everything
NoDrop (and say goodbye to any kind of player economy), or put hard or soft
level caps on items.  The latter is obviously the correct answer which is why
the current designers are doing it.  (Many Luclin items will have lower stats
when worn by PCs below the recommended level; new CT gear is flat-out
unequippable below level 50.)

|I suspect the ones who complain loudest about stuff like
|the Neth' Chitin (ie: stuff which is good at the level you can get it)

	By now, the Neth' Chitin ISN'T good at the level you can get it any more.
Centi Longswords are 14/27 -- my primary-hand epic is 14/24! -- and they are
now considered standard equipment for all starting fighter classes.  How
impressed with them do you think those people will be when they reach level 50
and fight in Maiden's themselves?  How many of them are going to go try to get
Short Swords of Morin or Silvery War Axes or Dragoon Dirks?

	It was flat-out STUPID to put loot of that quality into the game with no
controls.  Trashed the economy and made risk/reward into a complete joke.
