Oh and I forgot, if you want to come back at a time when there's a new 
server opening (non-transfer) with ONLY the original world zones to 
start with, with further expansions being unlocked through server-first 
kills / quests, then now's the time.

The Combine server is coming soon.

Various threads in here and on the EQ Forums with more detail.  Note: 
this is not 'an original' EQ server, it's going to have all the features 
of the current servers if the zones support it, but just a restricted 
set of zones and expansion-specific features.
