Damage is some product of both numbers.  Delay is determined only by
the bow.  Range, honestly I can't remember.  I want to say the higher
of the two.

Very cheap.  If you just want something to get on the hate list, we are
talking coppers per arrow, maybe silvers.  The more expensive ones do
more damage and have longer ranges but cost a lot more in time or money
to make.

Yes.

Yes.

Put a quiver in your top-left inventory slot (I believe this still
matters) and it will provide bow haste.  Bow haste is a factor of the
weight reduction on the quiver.  (1/3 * WR = haste)  For a 60% WR
quiver, you would get 20% haste.  Note that quiver haste stacks with
regular item haste as well as spell/song haste.  It is just one more
bonus to archery...
