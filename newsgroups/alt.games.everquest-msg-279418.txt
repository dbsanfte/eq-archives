The psychology of the colour red... dominance, excitement, urgency. On a 
subconcious level seeing red literally increases your heart and 
respiratory rate... we're hardwired to respond to it.

If it hadn't been so grossly overused, your right, it would probably be 
tolerated where it made some sense a bit more.

/shrug

Sounds like a solicitation to me.

If the creature was pounding on his ass at the very moment, I wouldn't 
object to a shout at all. If your comfortably shopping in the plane of 
knowledge, then your need of 'help' is a lot more abstract.

Just as a man running into a gunshop yelling HELP! CAN SOMEONE HELP ME 
KILL THE WOLVES! I NEED BULLETS TO KILL THE WOLVES! suggests that there 
is a pack of wolves on his tail... not that he's planning a hunting trip 
for the weekend.

Red has psychology and wetware attached to it.

Its an accepted means of communicating with a captive audience. You 
don't walk into a restaruant and shout "HEY! WHERES THE BATHROOM?" just 
because you can't see any staff, don't have any one in particular to 
contact, and can reasonably expect any of the patrons to know the 
answer. Even before phones this was highly unacceptable.

I'll concede I obnoxious-ed it up a notch with repetition. But even so 
if I were at a table in a tavern and some guy stepped in the door and 
shouted out at the top of his lungs that he would like directions to the 
bakery I'd still think it was highly obnoxious.

And for what its worth, the repetition is real. Most people shouting for 
a KEI repeat... some not chaining their please, but every minute or so.

I've yet to see you posit an example where auction is actually 
inappropriate. Offering or Solicting goods or services is hardly 
inappropriate for /auction.

"Get your peanuts HERE"... "Get your peanuts HERE"

You ever been to a ball game? Those guys are 'shouting'. But its on an 
'auction' frequency. Its 'loud', but its not 'red'. Shout is louder than 
Auction.

From an RP standpoint, how often would you feel the need to disturb an 
entire city by shouting for basic services at the top of your lungs??

How much do we really shout in the real world?

In the real world, people -DON'T- feel compelled to send THAT many 
messages outside of present company in a non-conversational manner.

When you are on the sidewalk looking for a particular merchants 
establishment do you shout "WHERES THE BAKERY" at the top of your lungs, 
and hope that somebody within earshot shouts back?? You'd likely ask 
someone else nearby, or go into a store and ask the merchant. 
(admittedly this last doesn't work too well in most EQ cities).

You should never hear WHERE DO I BUY COFFINS? shouted out in plane of 
knowledge. Nobody behaves like that in real life. Even beggars use 
say... they're never standing on the corners going "ANYONE SPARE SOME 
CHANGE??" every couple minutes.

One final issue with /shout is that its equally loud at all points. In 
the real world, you can't 'home' in on someone shouting and eventually 
have a conversation. You don't generally stand in opposite corners of a 
city shouting at each other (or worse right next to each other).

I'd like to see shouts get 'dimmer' the farther away you are. That'd be 
pretty cool. :)
