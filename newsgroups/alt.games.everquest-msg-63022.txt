EQ Doesn't play with system DLLs.

Did the users upgrade to DX8 in preperation for the new expansion?  If so,
MS is infamous for tweaking all sorts of DLLs and this would be a lot more
probable than blaming EQ for connection speed issues to an ISP.  2 totally
unrelated issues.  EQ uses an established connection, it does not create an
Internet connection.

I'd check the windows system area for any DLL updates (check by date) and
see what your users have done to their systems.  Remember one thing when
dealing with users "I didn't change anything, just did this one thing.
Well, Ok I also had to ... but that COULDN'T do this to my machine..."  the
last part is usually AFTER you tore the machine down, the app down and
everything else and questioned them repeatedly...

Good luck.
