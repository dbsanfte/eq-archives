This seems to be quite a common occourance judging by :
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=1942

I would have to say that till now I had never heard of this earring and
I have hunted at least 12 levels in Loio. I'm guessing that he really
did not know.

I'm guessing that 10k is a bit steep, but as it is no drop we will never
know.

It is not reportable as far as I can see.
*Nothing* is cause to train in my book.

I suggest that you think again, is it possible that he really did not
know what the earring is ? (Like I would not have) 
I would hardly call it ninja looting "About 30 seconds later we see:"

Next time you group there make sure that you set-up loot rules and
inform people of the existance of this sweet no drop ear piece.
Otherwise the same may happen again. I know that if I had been in your
group yesterday and had seen corpses sitting ther3e for 30+ seconds I
would have cleaned up the corpses and said to my self "oh another 5gp
ring cool".

Sorry about you bad luck, but this guy could quite easily be genuine.

Jim
