HOW TO TURN $6 INTO $6,000!!!!!!

READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE!

I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while back,
I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an
article similar to this that said you could make thousands of dollars within
weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, Yeah right,
this must be a scam, but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading.

Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address
stated in the article.

You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #6,
and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No
catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people
first, I thought about trying it.

I figured: what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, right? Then I
invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!... within 7 days, I started
getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but
the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the
end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third
week I had over $10,000.00 and it's still growing.

This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00
and it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps,
I have spent more than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works
and most importantly, why it works....Also, make sure you print a copy of
this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I
promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start
making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy!

Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or download
it.)

Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! It's easy. It's
legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage)

IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and
it is virtually no risk - it really works!!!! If all of the following
instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.

PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can
be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the
honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by
carefully adhering to the instructions. You will now become part of the Mail
Order business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible,
it's a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists.

Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists.
However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income
which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that
list.

Here are the 4 easy steps to success:

STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece
of paper; PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST. Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and
place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen
through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of
the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each
with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a
$1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it!
Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the
legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!

Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:

Kevin Lee
8377 Apt. I Montgomery Run Rd.
Ellicott City, MD 21043

Stephanie Hicks
1283 Evening Canyon
Henderson, NV 89014

Tia Loske
40 Hancock St.
Ft. Plain, NY  13339

Brian Montgomery
1679 S State highway 121 Apt 1506
Lewisville, TX 75067

Justin L Hill
858 New Terrace Ct. NE
Keizer, OR 97303

John Summer
1405 North Ohio Avenue
Atlantic City, NJ 08401


STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other
names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on
the list.

STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close
to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least 200
newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is 200,
but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! This is perfectly
legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the
Postal lottery laws.
Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you
can use it again, and again.

PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty
and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to the
directions. Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the program will
continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way.

NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a
computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that
you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap
the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.)

So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six
members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with
one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when
your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars
in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the first
six people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and
you're in business!

---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ 

Step 1 - You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own
posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag
your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from the edit
menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory.

Step 2 - Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the
blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of
the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list.

Step 3 - Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your
postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back to.

Step 4 - Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various
newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.)

Step 5 - Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message
by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit
menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as
they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the
post message button. You're done with your first one!
Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different
newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about
30 seconds for each newsgroup!

**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!!
BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200**

That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within days!
You may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of mail
you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to
use, as long as the postman will deliver it.

**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.**

Now the WHY part: Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very
low example). So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now,
each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings,
each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original
5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts
with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional
$125.00!

Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at
#3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK,
now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200
letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just
made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to
200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups
react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original investment of only $6.00!

AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest
posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the list,
putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to
remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over the world are
joining the internet and reading these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are
now!! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works??

I think so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one
sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when
there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the
internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates
are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those
joining the actual internet.

Remember: Play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work.
