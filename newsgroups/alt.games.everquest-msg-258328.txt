Hands down the best way to work weapon skills is to find a group fighting
around or above your level. and ASK them if they would mind you working
<insert weapon skill here> ?
Most people are smart enough to say sure since the odds of one toon working
a weapon with a poor skill KSing a group is rather slim and the extra dps
helps them kill faster.
I've often found that its easy enough to bum a haste of the group
shammy/chanta since it works to their advantage.
It can be amazing how fast you can work a skill up with the right weapon. My
blunt skills were crap til well after 65th level (never had a 1 or 2 hand
blunt worth using) Then I looted a GSO4W out of bot with like a 10 2hb skill
and figured I owed it to the people who'd lost the rolls to work the skill
up.
Took me maybe 4 hours of working it to get the skill to the point that it
was worth using in groups for the final points (about 200 skill) after that
I just used it until I maxed.
The most important thing to look for is low delay more swings = more chances
for skill ups and lower delay means more swings haste sure don't hurt
either.
