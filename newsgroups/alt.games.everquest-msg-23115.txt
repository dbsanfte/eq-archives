I just used the firepots to get from Oasis to Firiona Vie, by way
of Cabalis West.  I was fairly apprehensive about doing so, but
it turns out that my concerns were needless.  You end up right
at the zone line to LOIO, out of range of any guards.  I had imbibed
an invis potion before clicking on the pot, and invis did not break
(another concern I had, going in) nor could the guards that I could
see, out of aggro range, see invis; I registered as indifferent.

I zoned out, and again found myself out of aggro range of the guards,
although its possible that there are roamers that get closer.  It is
necessary to run out fairly close to one of the newbie guards, as
we always see in cities; they didn't see invis either, and being familiar
with the inherant slowness of the lizzard pair on duty from tinkering
around with an Iksar monkling, I wager that even without invis I could
easily have scooted between them and been out of range before they
thought about chasing me, on my silly TBoots.

I wish I oculd say that I was familiar with any See Invis mobs in Cabablis,
I'll have to think of a way to test that.  Hmm, here's a plan, make a
newbie iksar necro, invis yourself, and wander around looking for
things that don't con indiff... amiable is just as bad as KOS, means they
see you, and therefore get marked down on your map as things for
the rogue to avoid.
