Definately been my experience that the taller outer wall is easier than the
center.  I could not get my high elf enchanter out no matter what illusion I
tried, or where I tried to swim out.  My shaman I managed to get out with no
trouble, by just swimming and look up, as I would anywhere else, and heading
to the outside walls.  I did get my shaman out once by swimming into the
nexus port too.
