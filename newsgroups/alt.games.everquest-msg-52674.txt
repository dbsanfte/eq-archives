If you can get your MR up by the time you hit the teens, then go to Rathe
mountains and hunt the basilisks, no one ever hunts them and they are great
exp up till about 19. At 19 head to OOT and hunt gargoyles (you get some
really good faction on these eg The dragon in DL won't want to kill you if
you do a few levels on them) Gargs are good till 27 but at 25 they are less
exp than you'll want. From there I went to OT at 25 till 43, then on to DL
till 45. At 45 I parked my butt in OOT at Gornit to marathon my way through
the first "true" hell level, did 45 & 46 there and made about 6k pp from
him. At 47 I went to the spirocs in TD, they were great exp till 51. At 51
BW or SF are good places to hunt and will get you to 54 easily enough. After
that it becomes limited for soloing. Allie in oot, brownies in Fay, still a
bit of exp in SF....
