Having taken my hatchling leezard tank through his first eight levels,
and gotten fletching up enough to get him a bow and some stacks of
arrows, I need to begin turning my attention to smithing. 

Some of the online smithing guides reccomend putting the max (20?)
training points into it and moving on from there. Some call that a waste
and advise just a priming point and sharpening rusty weapons for a bit. 

I've been collecting rusty weapons now for a while (have a couple bags
of them) and my goal is to do this as *cheaply* as possible so I can get
to the point of doing banded armor as quickly and efficiently as I can.

With my main I found that beyond a "priming point" in certain skills,
all my warrior skills went up on their own just fine through day to day
use. So I'm leaning towards cheating and stuffing 20 training points in.
However, ther's always that temptation to save themm all til thirteen
and stick them all in duel weild. (*snicker*)

Is it worth it? What's the better (cheaper while efficient) way to go to
get my smithing skills off the ground? For reference, remember this is a
penniless noob character with NO access to any funds beyond what you can
loot in the newbie zones, and from sub-level ten quests, etc.
