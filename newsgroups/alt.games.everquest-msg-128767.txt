Hello guys and gals :)

I have been seeing all these Power Levelling/Plat making/Trade skill/Class
etc etc Guides on Ebay and wonder if it's worth purchasing? I'm sure that a
lot of the information contained there is just accumulated knowledge that
relatively new (only one year) players like myself just haven't found yet.
But is it worth my hard earned cash to buy any of these suckers?

What are your thoughts?
