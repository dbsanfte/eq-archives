You mean there already isn't a RL value to ingame items? 

Anyway, it seems a bit of a stretch though to equate the ingame casino
to RL gambling based on a prospective mechanism to allow transfers of
ingame items for RL $$, after all, say you spend $100 and buy a
million plat [from Yantis??] then log in and go to Shadling's Roost
and blow it all in the casino. Say you win something nice, you then go
and put it up for sale on Ebay or /auction it. Someone wants it, wins
the bid, then you use the hypothetical SOE mechanism to transfer it
and get xx dollars for it. Doesn't that pretty much exist already,
albeit in spite of SOE's efforts (however inconsistent) to the
contrary?

I don't know but I think that people in general are greatly
overestimating the amount of revenue that a formal mechanism to trade
ingame items between characters for cash is going to generate for SOE
versus what it would cost SOE to monitor, analyze, and adjust to
manipulate the market for items across so many servers via drop-rates
and item stats. The problems that they would create for themselves
would be considerable compared to the comparatively miniscule revenue
stream it would generate.

So do you believe that SOE would needlessly risk (through manipulation
of ingame drop rates, etc.) a fairly steady, predictable, revenue
stream (user subscription fees) for a unsteady, unpredictable revenue
stream (item transfer fees)? The argument can only really hold true if
the current group of users has already declined to the hardcore "I
will play regardless of how bad it gets" users. That is not to say
that corporate SOE couldn't be stupid morons, but that is unlikely,
whatever evidence they have provided to the contrary.

Comments that SOE are already doing that by providing poor CS, poor
response to user suggestions, and poorly implemented expansions are
not answering the question. Why do you think they are trying to do
something -- even if you think their focus is wrong -- unless they
have begun to recognize that the user base is dissatified and that
alternatives [to EQ] are available?

I would be against a "vending machine" type system with items supplied
by SOE.

I was originally opposed to the concept but after all the discussion,
I think I may be mistaken and wonder if it would be better to have a
formalized procedure to transfer items for cash in place of the ad hoc
system now in use. It is not as if transfers for cash don't happen
anyway. If SOE wants to charge a fee for the service, so be it.

However they implemented it, I would be against directly accessing it
from my Station Account unless additional safeguards were put into
place to prevent hacked accounts from being used to purchase stuff
(i.e. separate PIN for the user's credit card or maybe a separate flag
so it can't be used except for specific purposes like subscription
purchase).

They could have used a better way to purchase expansions rather than
>click buy< and have it rush through instead of asking if you wanted
to buy the expansion, so you can back out if you made a mistake.

I will have to think about it more.
