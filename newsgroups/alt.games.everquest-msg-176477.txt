Funny how people reach level 62, and still don't have a clue about the game.
:b

/doability X
/pause n,/doability X
/pause n,/doability X
/pause n,/doability X
/pause n,/doability X

That makes one attempt at bind wounds per line in the social macro.

I think at level 60+ you should understand basic features like this.  :b

There is no looping mechanism, and no way to chain buttons, so, you are
limited to the number of lines in the social button for the number of bind
wounds you can do on one key.
