    I think it would also be hard to find 3 other people who have LDoN
who would be willing to be used this way.  If a soloer approached me
asking me to group and then disgroup I don't think I'd be inclined to do
it.  And if I were kicked after we got the quest without prior warning I
would /ignore the person.

    Hmm... is it possible to enter a dungeon once you've been flagged
for the adventure but booted from the group?
