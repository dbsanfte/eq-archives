It's not going to be an EQ replacement for me, since it's a different kind 
of game.  But, I will be buying it and enjoying the Hell out of it.  I 
started playing D&D 22 years ago, and am pretty excited about playing it on 
the computer - from the DM side and the player side.

I'm not a very creative person, but I'm a great programmer.  I'll probably 
make little "drop-in" encounters, etc. that people can put in their modules 
and maybe so my own Module.  I'd need a helper with a flair for imagination 
to do my own Module / Campaign setting, though.
