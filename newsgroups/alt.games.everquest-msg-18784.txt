 Well as a Wiz, EVACs are the only way for me to get to South Ro, 
Emerald Jungle and Skyfire and a place or two I can't think of at 
the moment so I use them as regular gates or group gates to save time.
 
 EVACS, as people have mentioned already casting in less time with the 
trade-off that it costs you more mana to cast. 
 
 Michael mentioned that an EVAC costs everyone with mana 300 mana, I 
did not know this or ever hear of it before nor have I noticed it. It 
may be true though. I think I will have to test that out. He also 
mentioned that there is also a chance that someone might get left 
behind. I have used EVAC maybe 20 to 30 times in an emergency situation 
and perhaps hundreds of times simply to get to South Ro or Emerald 
Jungle or Skyfire and never once has anyone failed to go with me unless 
they died before the cast was finished.Perhaps IF EVACs do cost 300 mana 
to those with mana and a person was OOM when the EVAC went off they wouldn't 
go with the caster. 
 
 But this doesn't make sense, since it implies that non-casting classes will
ALWAYS go since they do not have mana and that casters MAY NOT go if they
don't have the mana needed to gate which is a bit unfair if you ask me. Why
should an OOM caster be required to stay behind after expending his mana to
try to save the group but a Tank with only a few HPs is not required to be
left behind? 
 
 Interesting, I will have to test this out.
