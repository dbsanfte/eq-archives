Hi all,
I made a Barbie Rogue.  So far I like it.  Was wondering what this hide then
sneak thing was until it finally worked.  Now it seems that when it does
work I get disconnected.  I have never had disconnect problems with this
game before.  Nothing consistent anyway, but this has happened to me 6 times
tonight.  Each time was using hide+sneak.

Anyone else ever have this happen?  If this is old news, sorry.  It's new to
me.

Sean...
