Well, IMO it woulda served 'em right, heh.  But, in the event, the
posted log shows less than 20 minutes until the PK flags were
removed.  And I'm guessing that it was direct tells that set the
whole thing off, it's not uncommon to see GM tags on Test, but
they're rarely there as CSRs, mostly dev types checking things
out.  So, you get some fools putting up petitions, despite the
warning about no regular GM support, and their petitions aren't
being answered, and they see GMs online, and they get the bright
idea to start sending direct tells (yeah, it's just a guess, but
remember these are not regular testees, they're /testbuff tourists
who don't believe that no support actually means no support).
