Sure thing, Rouge is French for Red it is also an old term for the cosmetics
we now call blusher.
You mean Rogue.

If your "Rouge" is after the all Noir look then Black Alloy is pretty easily
acquired from Runnyeye, no boots in Alloy tho' You'd have to make do with
Black Iron for them.
No idea what this masked look is but in old (pre SoL) graphics Mrylokar had
a black plate graphic and the the Half Elf plate helm had a visor that
covered the upper part of the face, the post SoL Half Elf plate helm is open
faced.
