Had a little pickup raid in PoI today.  Just popped in, found some
folks fighting there and asked if they needed a 59 mage :)

about a 3 hour raid, ran all around the place and took out the
Junk Beast - AoE blind, and 975 a pop melee.  An ad-hoc raid of
18 people took him out pretty easily. 

Amazing respawn rate in there.  I see a group based around the
holy trinity doing quite well using them to grind xp - the 
things hit a bit hard for anything but a plate tank to tank 
them though.
