I think part of the problem might be third person from behind players
(my favorite view) getting the wrong idea. Note the races he thinks
run faster, they are small, compact, and faster animated races. Note
that I say "animated." As character size increases.. starting with a
human and really going up with a troll or ogre, the animation of the
arms and legs moving when running slows down greatly. Therefore if you
are in a 3rd person from behind view your troll or ogre seems to be
moving quite slowly to you while if you are playing a wood elf or
ESPECIALLY a dwarf, halfling or gnome, you really seem to be trucking.
I have a dwarf paladin which almost never has SOW but "seems" fast
enough to me because from behind its legs are really working. 
I think that gives some players the wrong idea. As you say they really
do move at the exact same running speed, the rest is an illusion.
