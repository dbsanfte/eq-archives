Paid 50pp for mine on Xev.  Not from a friend, just auctioned WTB and
offered 50pp.  Got a deal, I think, as component cost is about 25pp. 
Probably should have paid 100 - 200 pp for it given the high trivial
on the Geerlock devices.

Equip in primary slot.

The question I have is how can I tell if it is doing anything???? 5%
is such a small bonus, and there is no on-screen indication that
anything is different when equiped.  With VI's track record if putting
things in the game that don't work...
