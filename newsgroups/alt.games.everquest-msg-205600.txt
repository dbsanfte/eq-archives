    80000 people, 47 servers. 1700 people per server average. Knock off 300
per server for The Bazaar (AFK mules), which would be an average (Quellious
is between 400 and 500 traders around the clock since summer began). So 1400
people playing EQ per server, average. I can remember when all the top
servers were in the mid-2000's in population, and the low servers were in
the low 1000's during off hours. The numbers per server have dropped. I
imagine it's more people actively playing the game than before - many
servers have been added since the numbers were hidden. But the server
populations have dropped.
