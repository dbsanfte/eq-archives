For me, the trick is to WARN me if the movie is SUPPOSED to be bad.  I knew
that SaM was supposed to be stupid, and since I'm insanely in love with the
star (ol' wasserface that I can't think of at the moment, which kinda kills
my previous few words, eh?) I enjoyed it a lot.

No one warned me that "The Mummy" was supposed to be rancid...I was pissed
that I wasted money on that thing.  HAD they, I MIGHT have liked it.
