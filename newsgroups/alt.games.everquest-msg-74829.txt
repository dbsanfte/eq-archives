Well, I have :

Fear, because thats what necros use

Dooming darkness, because it is a lower mana use

Bond of death, as a counter to lich

Feign death, cause you never know

Augment death, because the refresh after meming it is so long, so I keep it
memed.

Drain soul, for those fast heals

Splurt, because not much resists it

and for the last its either  Plague or poision bolt, depending on the
resists of the mob.
Or I may use Ignite bones, for the DD  plus I like the effect on it.
