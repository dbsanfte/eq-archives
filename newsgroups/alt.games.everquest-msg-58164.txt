[El Snippo Grande]
Wow, you two sure hit it off, didn't you? =D Anyway, speaking as a
cleric, I have to say that my initial reaction was "why the hell
did Tiru use Celestials on a big, bad troll like Jakugg?" I'm no
expert, but a 50 troll warrior with a couple cleric buffs on should
break 2.5khp easily, shouldn't he? Complete Heal at 500hp = 2000hp
healed. Celestial Heal heals 180 per tick for 4 ticks, a total of
720hp healed. Cel is 225mana, complete is 400. Another thing to
remember is that parts of some Celestial heals may be wasted, as
the previous pulse might have pushed you above (MaxHP - 180). On
casters, that's no biggy, you want a fast heal, and celestial is
great on them. On warriors? Ick.

As to the aggro issue, I have partnered with warriors and paladins
a lot, and not had much trouble with drawing aggro unless I've had
to heal early in the fight. And as Martin said, it's important not
to sit right after Complete Healing.

Finally, as an aside to Martin: You seem to wonder why there is so
much resentment towards you here; take a look at your first response
to Jazz in the SK thread and tell me honestly if you think the tone
in it is civil. Also, remember this: Jazz is a long-time, liked and
respected contributor to the group, whereas you're the new kid on
the block. You do the math... All that said, I think his first
response to you was over the top too, but hey, since when did my
opinion count for anything around here? =D

Rune, who kind of assumes it was Tiru, sorry if that's wrong!
