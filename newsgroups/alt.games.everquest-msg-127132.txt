A guildie just mentioned that they have one toon which they cannot load.
They can load any of their alts just fine, but every time they try to load
this one particular toon (a druid), they get returned to the Server
Selection screen.  The /petition yielded nothing, and there was nothing on
the Tech Support FAQ about it.

Anyone ever heard of this problem?

TIA,
Crash
