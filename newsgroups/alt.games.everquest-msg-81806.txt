Batwings are sold for a bit over 1sp in a few locations. The one most people
know is the west end of EC. I believe theres a place in bazaar or
shadowhaven that sellls then too, as well as a place in the caster tower in
freeport.
If you want to makle money, then go for bone chips. They arnt sold by
vendors anywhere. You need to pick your zones to sell in tho. Zones like
kelethin for example wont be much good for selling chips. Necros tend not to
go to kelethiin. If you could make it to say SK, you might do quite well
(did someone mention treeants hehe)
Also, althouh it doesnt bother me, a lot of people dont like HTML posts
here.
