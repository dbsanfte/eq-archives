This seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to something.  Most reasonable people
have already said, you accept responsibility for your actions, and thats the
first thing to having control of yourself.

Lokari , said , it 'manifests' the persons already existing difficulties and I
could agree more.

I believe that the most you can say about EQ or any other activity that
illicits a pleasure response, is that it is either more or less addicitve than
some other thing, or is strongly addictive.

In the same vein (no pun intended) you cant blame Heroin for addiction, you
always have a choice and if you have an addictive personality then it will be
harder for you to make a healthy choice.  You may be more likely to chose to
escape the external stresses, which you want to avoid by escaping them somehow,
more often than is healthy.

If your stresses are transient, then it might not be a problem, if the
consequences of _not_ dealing with them are long term then you have a problem,
for example, studies are difficult, you feel you're stupid or someone is giving
you grief constantly.

Whether you think how easily it is to become addictted to something is the
strength of the 'thing' , the way you were brought up (nuture) , a genetic
disposition (nurture) , a set of circumstances (you are being stressed in your
life by someone or something) , or a mixture of all these things, then you
_still_ have a choice.  No one is forcing you to play EQ or drink too much etc.

Having said all this, I have a lot of sympathy for people who find it hard to
handle their self-control, as I struggle with this too.  I agree that EQ _is_
addictive, and very strongly so.  However it is not EQ's fault and it's up to
you to handle it, by talking to people, changing your behaviour, changing your
circumstances and perhaps getting some help from any friends that understand a
little.

Its not funny, and it is serious if you want to be healthy.

Finally, I would resist the social pressure to do what is considered the
_right_ thing, simply because its socially acceptable.  That is dogmatic and
means you arent thinking for yourself.  Personally I would rather make a
mistake and have some character, than be a carbon copy of some idealised
perfect human who has everything under control and does the right thing all the
time - that would be boring and leave no variety.

Regards,

S.
