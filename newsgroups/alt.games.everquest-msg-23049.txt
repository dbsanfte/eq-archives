That's fine for buying/selling, but the crown would make a good druid
item out in the field when you wouldn't want to use a crude stein
instead of your handheld WIS items. A druid can charm animals, but is
often quite sucky at it due to low charisma.

I'd rather lose a few WIS off my head slot for the CHA, then 10 or more
WIS off a hand slot.
