(The following oversimplifies the situation, ignoring class and
race based exp distinctions... happily Verant is about to
implement a new exp structure which will make it much closer
to an accurate representation)

I believe that you get exp as long as you are not less than 2/3rds the
level of the highest level character in your group.  Thus, the level
20 paladin will get exp with anyone up to 30, but none at all if anyone
31st level joins.  Check on the 2/3rds number, but the rest is
accurate: it is a question of the ratio of the lowest to the highest.

Now, on the other hand, the -amount- of exp that 20 paladin
will get is based on his exp total (soon to be level) versus that
of the rest of the group.  Assume that there are 60,000 exp
points coming in to the party in the next 10 minutes.

a party of 6 level 20s will each get 10,000 points

A party of 6 level 30s will each get 10,000 points

But a party of 5 level 20s with one level 30 will see
each level 20 getting 9230 while the 30 gets 13846.

One level 20 with 5 level 30s will see the level 20
getting 7058 while each level 30 gets 10588

With your particular group construction, the
paladin was getting 8695 points out of every
60,000, swapping out the 22 cleric for a 29
cleric he will now get 8275 points out of every
60000.

In other words, he will be getting only 95% of
what he used to be getting!

This assumes of course that the group pulls
exactly the same number of mobs in that
ten minute period, and that the odds of your
dying with a 29 cleric in the group are exactly
the same as with a 22 cleric.
