I guess that I should know better than to ask an rhetorical here.

Yeah, yeah.  So they said.  I even believe them.  Although I
don't particularly understand their view of the situation.
But then I haven't played the 61+ PoP raiding game, so I'll
accept that DoTs may look weak from that "lofty" PoV.  Back
in the realm of ordinary mortals, however, DoTs are incredible.
I have not yet ceased to be amazed by how much more powerful my
Druids and Shaman are than melees, and their DoTs are a huge
part of that.

And in that event I will no doubt join the chorus.  But I'll still
lack sympathy for any whining about losing duration extension on
Necro/SK snares.
