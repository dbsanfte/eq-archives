I know another dumb one :)

A friend of mine also plays everquest and decided to start a brand new
warrior. Since he had a lvl 45 Druid, he had plenty of cash to buy the new
warrior a complete set of uber-armor, and he twinked his warrior quite
nicely.

He starts playing in Halas, happily hunting polar bear cubs, decaying
skeletons, and other newbie animals. He was about to DING to lvl 2 when he
mistakenly attacked Vengeful Soloist, thinking it was just another decaying
skeleton. (Little could he know, he never had been to Everfrost with his
druid) Since he was pretty far from the guards of Halas, and he could not
find his way around the snowy maze he did not live.....

Tough luck, happens all the time to newbies, even twinked ones that are
hopelessly lost in Halas. Luckily for him he died not too far from the
newbie zone, and his body was quickly located.... a nice person ooc'd him
that he found his corpse, and gave him the loc. Happily on his way to get
his corpse back, the most terrible thing that can happen to a twinked newbie
that just died: LinkDead. His cablemodem provider (which is what I use) had
announced a downtime of about 2 hours to upgrade network components, and
guess what he forgot about....

After about 15 minutes of trying and hoping for a new conncection he freaked
out, he ran over to my house, where he arrived about 10 minutes before his
corpse would decay.... only to find me at the kitchen table drinking my
morning coffee, not even thinking about my comp.... of course, i did not
have a connection either, but I had a dial-up too. So being the good friend
that I am i let him dial in, log on to EQ..... only to have a newbie tell
you "your corpse just dissapeared a minute ago....". Too late, the 30
minutes have past (by more then 5 minutes i would say) and yes.... his
nicely twinked corpse was gone, gone, gone, never to be found again.... he
tried to get a GM to get his corpse back, but he was unsuccesfull. GM's need
to sleep too, and we are in Europe... it must have been 3 at night on a
saturday in the US westcoast. GM said: Decay is decay, rules are rules....

Oh boy seldom did i see my friend go home in a bad mood like that.....

Lesson: Only twink your character when he/she is lvl 6 or above....and
always make sure you have a dial-up as emergency ;))

My 2 Euro's.
