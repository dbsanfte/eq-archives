If you ask me, Clerics are the greediest class.  =D

"I need that gem to pay for symbols"
"What symbol?  I don't see no symbol"
"uhh... the one I cast on myself"
"Aren't you supposed to be casting it on the TANK"
"But I don't have any gems to do that"
"why not?"
"Cause no one ever lets me loot gems to pay for symbols"

hehe, no offense to all the clerics out there, I love ya guys, now, how bout
rezzing me in Chardok?  =P
