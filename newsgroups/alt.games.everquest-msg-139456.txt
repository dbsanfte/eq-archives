Gee, why didn't I think of that? ;-)

Ok, smartass. Now you've identified how six people in big guilds
(because let's face it.. if you make it up to sorcerer and get all the
AA points to get MB, you've written yourself a ticket into a raiding
guild if you want one) can raise 55K over a month and a half. That's
assuming they all want to sit in EJ every week and get the pop each
time.

Out of a server population of... what? 10K people? We now return you to
the realms of reality. Bring an oxygen tank next time. The thin air up
there is getting to your brain.
