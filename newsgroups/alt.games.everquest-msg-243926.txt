Take a look at http://tinyurl.com/2y4l6 .  It's a review of a device from HP
that seems to do just what you're asking for.  It's not cheap and the
process is still not super-easy, but they did give it 3 out of 5 and I would
guess the firmware issues they had have probably been resolved by now since
the review was done back in January.  I was actually thinking of getting one
of these myself, but I'm not sure if this is the best device out there.  If
anyone else has links to something different I'd be interested to see them
:-)
