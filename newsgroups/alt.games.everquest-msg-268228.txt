Yeah, it's nice to be able to ignore all those resource nodes. I hate
everything about the tradeskill system. The time wasting, the
impossibly slow collection quests, the tradeskill interdependance, the
retarded crafting mini-game...

I'm sure there will be some changes to the system as the game evolves,
but I doubt it'll ever change enough to make me want to do it.
