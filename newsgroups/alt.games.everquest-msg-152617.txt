Ok. I have known it exists, but I just never really thought I would
worry about loot that requires long camps to obtain. I just read a
post talking about a five-day camp as part of the druid "half-epic"?

You've gotta be kidding me! Is this simply a case where the only
people who will be able to successfully camp this item are the
unemployed?! How on earth (Norrath) can anyone camp anything for that
long?

I have a job and a family to support. I have heard of camp shifts.
What happens when my mob pops and I'm at work? My guildmate takes it
out for me? What if the loot is nodrop? Do they have to call me at
work to come home, log in and loot it before it poofs? I don't know
about everyone else, but I have certain responsibilites the come with
my job that prevent that from being an option, not that I could do it
in the necessary timeframe.

The whole notion of camping for lengthy periods just completely
boggles my mind. Someone please tell me that I'm wrong about how it is
handled, otherwise I will have to resign myself to the fact that I
will never have any of my epics, half- or otherwise.
