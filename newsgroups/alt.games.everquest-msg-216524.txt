I think you'll do fine. As some people suggested, from a pure
powergaming point of view the shaman would be better, with the ability
to haste the sk and slow the mobs, and add some dps with dots and pet,
but you'll still do fine with the sk, as either of you can control
adds effectively, either with feign or pacify, the pet can add a tiny
bit extra dps, and later on the sk can actually supply you and himself
with a bit of free mana.
