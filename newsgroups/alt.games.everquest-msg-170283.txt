}one limitation on the affliction focus: The haste line only works on a
}spell with a minimum 3 sec cast time.  So it cuts down a 3 sec turgurs
}to 2 sec, but does not affect the fast root spell with 1.2 sec
}standard duration.

Yeah, I realized later that the stun I tested didn't have a 3 sec cast 
time, nor did it have a 36 second duration.  So the 'affects stuns' issue 
may still be undecided.  Hmm... Wonder if it works with Dyn's Dizzying 
Draught. :)

}Also, so far I have not found a click-item spell
}that is affected by focus items (e. g. the shaman epic dot is not
}extended).

Hmm... I thought clicky items generally worked with focus effects.  I'll 
have to check that again.  Obviously the 'efficieny' lines are irrelevant.
