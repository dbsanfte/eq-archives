Possibly, and writing too many political arguments.  After a while, it gets
numbing.

What I'm saying is, the 2000 popular vote totals is an invalid count.
Whatever we may say about other things, (ie the Census) really doesn't
change anything.  The Bush vote is underrepresented, in as much as a good
chunk of the military vote (strongly republican) is missing through no fault
of our own.
