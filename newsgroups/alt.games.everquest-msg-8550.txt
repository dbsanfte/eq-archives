Any spell that does damage will break mez on a mob. DoTs are probably the
worst spells to cast on a mezzed mob because the enchanter will be unable to
mez it until the DoT wears off. Here's a few spells that are safe to cast:

Snare
Root (not the druid/ranger kind, which does damage)
Slow-type spells
Tashani-type spells

Just don't cast anything that does damage, and you'll be fine. =)
