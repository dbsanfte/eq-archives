World War II Online has the very real possibility of sucking me away from EQ
despite their being of two different genres. The concept is one I've thought
about since the early rounds of MM online games. I can really see WWIIO
eating up my time ... I just have to dig up some reviews and such and see
what the word is. The game may be a shooter, and I tend to be a roleplayer
in EQ, but nonetheless, that's that.

I agree wholeheartedly. The single biggest thing that contributed to my
choosing EQ over Ultima Online was the optional PvP. It is highly unlikely
that I'd play a similar game that did not limit PvP in some strong way. Dark
Ages limits it to certain areas, if my recollection is right. Assuming that
means there will be "safe" areas in which adventuring is still feasible,
that could still lure me.

EverQuest has its share of problems, some of them glaring and some that
interfere with the kind of fun I'd like to have. But the lack of mandatory
PvP is something that will certainly keep me locked into Norrath as opposed
to others worlds, for the time being.
