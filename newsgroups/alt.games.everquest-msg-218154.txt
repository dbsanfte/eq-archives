Yes I do have utter control - I chose whether or not I breed. After that is
where the lack of control sets in. That first decision is the most important
one and where the resulting  responsibility arises from. There are lot's of
other factors that should be considered which include (genetics is a small
part over an overall package), sustainable stability in family life,
necassary resources and personal mental stability

And that is exactly the definition I intended it to have.

You are insisting on veiwing genetics in pure isolation. Genetics can affect
enviroment and enviroment can affect genetics, even at the level of a few
generations.
