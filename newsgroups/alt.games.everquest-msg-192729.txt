Your best bet would be to hit a website and read about the next batch of
spells you have at your level for your class.  Off the top of my head,
www.everlore.com while not a great eq site (imho) does have a break down of
spells for each class.

Just move on and try to find new groups that are in your level range.  There
is such a wide group of people in EQ that some just want to burn through the
levels and you'll have no way in hell keeping up if you're employeed ;)  You
can try to solo for a bit, but just don't expect to make long term friends
in game and be able to group with them all the time.  You can keep in
contact with them, but likely they (or you) will move on and be in opposite
ends of the map.

Hit www.eqatlas.com and take a peek at various zones around your and what
monsters are in them (eq atlas has a link to alakhazams(sp?) beastiery at
the bottom of each map)

Again, www.eqatlas.com and either print out the map for the zone you're in,
or just stay on the page and ALT-TAB between windows when you need to get
your heading.  Practice the skill 'Sense heading' (hit it all the time when
you're just walking around) and get used to learning how to use the /loc
command.

Have fun.
