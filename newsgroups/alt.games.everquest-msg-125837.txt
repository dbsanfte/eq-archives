Any quiver that list a weight reduction has bow haste on it.  The
haste is, IIRC, half of the listed weight reduction value.

For a simple bow haste quiver, a normal player made quiver gives
something like 10% bow haste.  If you want something faster, you can
get either a Jeweled Quiver of the Hand from Sanctus Seru
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1479) which has
17%, or get a tailor made Fleeting Quiver which gives you a whopping
30% bow haste.

At 51, the Jeweled Quiver would be utter cake to get.  My ranger has
one and I quite like it.  Now I just need to save up some coin and get
a Fleeting Quiver.  :-)

Also, if I'm not mistaken, you might want to remember that you do NOT
get the haste from the quiver if you have a full stack of arrows in
your ammo slot.  Just keep one single arrow there and all shall be
good.
