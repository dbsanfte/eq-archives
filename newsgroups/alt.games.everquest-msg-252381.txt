I'm gonna have to disagree with you on this one.  For example, the
book goes to some lengths to convey the sheer amount of work it
takes for Johnny to make it through OCS.  He has to study his ass off.
In the movie, he just kind of... gets promoted, and that's that.

(At least, that's what I remember thinking when I watched it.  Maybe
I missed something?)
