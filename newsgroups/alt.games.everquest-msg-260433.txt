Thats really silly.  That was one of the two best situations to PL
Leadership points.     Leadership is not at all like AA points... it takes
away 20% of the experience you get per kill, but it either gives you a set
amount of leadership experience (1% every kill)... or a minimum amount of
leadership experinece.     The absolute best place to powerlevel Leadership
AA's is on a raid.   Because that 20% you lose is 20% of almost nothing.
But you still gain leader points as fast as an exp group.

In a normal exp group, fighting in BoT for say two hours, you'll gain about
150% of an AA's and 100% of a leadership point.  If you had had leadership
exp off, you would have gained 20% more...  so your leadership exp cost you
30% of an AA per leader point.

Being a groupleader in a very long raid, I gained 30% of an AA, and 4 full
group leader points.  If leadership had been off, I would have gained 20%
more... so 6% of an AA more.   Meaning the cost per leadership point was
about 1.5% of an AA.  *Twenty times* more efficient than fighting high blues
/ whites.

The effect is less pronounced when fighting low blues / light blues.   It's
only 3 or 4 times more efficient than raising leadership by fighting high
cons.   But it's still much smarter to have leadership on when bottomfeeding
and off when doing the challenging exp groups.
