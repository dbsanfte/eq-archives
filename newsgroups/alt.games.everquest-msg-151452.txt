I've got a TNT2 at work, and it works OK.  I don't know about a TNT1.
Before I put the TNT2 in that machine, it had an ATI RagePro, and even that
sort of worked.  Some textures were screwed up, and rain looked really weird
(interestingly...rain looked weird exactly the same way in DAoC on that
card).  The frame rate was bad, but barely acceptable if I use the new
interface.  Old interface was unplayable.  I believe the RagePro is slower
than a TNT1, so the TNT1 should be OK.

I didn't try anything outside of the Old World, though.
