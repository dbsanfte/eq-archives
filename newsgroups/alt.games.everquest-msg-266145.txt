I'm afraid you're dead wrong here.  Of the five subtests as reported by 
USA Today, George W. Bush scored at or above average on all but *one* 
the pilot aptitude portion...a portion that does not correlate with 
actual intelligence as measured by IQ.  The subtests normally associated 
with IQ, indicate his is markedly above average, over one and a half 
standard deviations so.

This sounds like wordplay.

Closeminded : Decisive :: Openminded : Flip-flopping ???

And how do you know his interests, anyway?  Do Canadians have some 
special insight into our president's interests?

Just because you call yourself an al Qaeda and do damage to other people 
doesn't mean you're part of the *organization* -- just as I don't blame 
the DNC for destroying my yard sign last month.  Don't confuse the two. 
  The fact is that we've made many more friends than enemies in Iraq due 
to our liberation.  Read the weblogs of soldiers over there.  Though 
they differ in political viewpoints, they all have touching stories of 
Iraqis' kindnesses to our troops in them.

You're obviously focusing on the Sunni Triangle, a small portion of Iraq 
that is home to the Saddam loyalists (same ethnicity, former members of 
the Ba'ath party).  But then again, they weren't friends of freedom to 
begin with.  They were the chosen few in the old Iraqi dictatorship.

You and PIPA saying something does not change reality, either.  The PIPA 
research method, if you can call it that, is laughable.  We all know how 
the exit polls turned out on election day here.  Looked like a Kerry 
landslide.  And, as you should know, historically, Republican supporters 
tend to be better educated and earn more than their Democrat counterparts.

And, by the way, conservative Christians and rural Americans are the 
salt of the earth.  I suggest you save your elitist remarks, lest I pick 
some groups out of your coalition to disparage.  On second thought, I'm 
too nice a person.
