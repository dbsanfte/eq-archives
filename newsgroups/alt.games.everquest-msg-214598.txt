My sense has been that the developers still need to do a bit of
tweaking of the algorithm that generates the dungeon's contents as the
team enters.  I have heard of low level teams getting in and
succeeding (not easily, but succeeding...)

My own experience, though, has been with my level 65 bestlord and a
group of friends who are also all level 65.  Many of these friends
have 50 AA's or more.  We have in the past done many Planes runs and
the team is well accustomed to working together.  Wipes are rare.

So far we have not succeeded once and frankly it has not even been
close.  We've wiped several times in some of the adventures.  The mobs
being generated for this team are way out of line for a timed trial.

Which tells me that the high level mobs need work...or the time limit
does...or something...
