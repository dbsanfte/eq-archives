AFAIK most of the hard-core crafters tend to join one
society.   You can join any of them, not just the one in
your home suburb.

As I understand it:

Society level determines what they sell (basically items from
the same tier players would be in at the same level -- newbie
through 9, Ant/CmnLands 10-19, TS at 20 and so on.)
Status determines what they'll sell *you*  (items for which
your status isn't high enough won't be displayed.)
