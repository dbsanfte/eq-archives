Ah, but the solution is just playing with yourselves. You don't interact 
with the mob much, you just run the choreographed game plan, using the 
mob as the music to which you time your show with.

I don't see much heroism in a 50+ person raid in the first place.
Healer #5 may be important to the overall success but he's no hero.

Cute. I was thinking much more recently, like immediately pre-manaburn 
era, not the 'mists of time' just post-beta.

ae stunning healers, teleporting players/healers (range issues), 
stunning dots, heal mitigation curses... and I can imagine any number of 
more exotic 'healing mitigation' techniques...

See below... drop rate should be a factor. There is no reason that a 
difficult mob should inherently slow the guild gear progression rate.

Not quite. 

If you post every last detail of the encounter it will have been 
deconstructed. That was my point.

Asking someone to provide a strat how to beat it, is still somewhat a 
trial and error, and would be dependant on your guild strengths, class 
breakdown, competence breakdown, etc...

Uh... why on earth are the 2 related??

If the mob is so hard you can't beat it consistently, then SOE can 
compensate by increasing its drop rate. If at some point you get to the 
point where you can beat it consistently, not only are you better 
raiders for it, but the candy will roll in that much faster.

Hell, I think a dynamic drop rate, as a function of how often the mob is 
farmed isn't a bad idea for eq in general. The easier a mob proves to 
be, the less often it drops. Sort of a watered down TLC.

And harder mobs would be bad in that respect how?? =)

/shrug

I think now you are being an SOE apologist.

EQ is not as good as it could be; its not even as good as it could be 
within the budget that they currently operate with. There is always room 
to improve.

On another note:

I noted you snipped the various synchronized swimming references. Do you 
agree that the current raid game, as it is, and as you like it, is 
essentially the same sort of challenge as synchronized swimming? (Not 
that there is something wrong with that, on any level, but it seems an 
apt analagy to me, and I wondered what you thought?)
