: CC would be my choice though, great zone

Hm, I was in CC once .. would you then stay at the entrance and just
pull from the mines to entrance? Sounds interesting.

OT: Well .. the things there hit me real hard .. tanking a Sarnak
Knight or Sabretooth Tiger seems to out of question for just a duo.
Berserkers or chickens should be doable though as well as cacti I 
guess .. maybe go more to the eastern/southeastern side?
