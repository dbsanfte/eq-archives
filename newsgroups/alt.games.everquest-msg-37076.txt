OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
