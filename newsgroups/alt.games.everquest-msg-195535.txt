People keep forgetting faction, which is okay, I guess, because it
seems Sony has as well.  My neutral humans started out KOS in fewer
places than any other race/class combo in the game, and compared to
the races who come close, they generally have "better" starting
faction. (ie. indifferent versus dubious, or threatening versus
scowling)

I haven't checked to see if that's the case with half elves, but I'm
given the impression it isn't.  They probably are a little more
relaxed than most, though.

This became a moot point after the game had been out a while, and
especially after Luclin and PoP.
