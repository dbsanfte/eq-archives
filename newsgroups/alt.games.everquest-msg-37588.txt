Hello,

I was wondering if anyone knows what +wis items are obtainable by a
level 18 High Elf Cleric.  I'm on Test Server, because I love the low
server population and lack of lag.  But with the low population, comes
the fact that you have to go out and earn your items, rather than buy
them.  I have been fortunate, because several people have given me
items to help me out.(No I didn't beg for them, people were generous
enough to notice my very bad armour and give them to me.)  The +wis
items I have so far are Savant' Cap, Foreman's Tunic, Split Paw Hide
Gloves.  Someone told me about the zombie quest in the quenos sewers,
but its taking me forever to get that guy to spawn.
