I may have to actually log back in and see if they changed a see-invis
doggie that usually wandered a pretty tight circuit where the big hallways
(from the Qinimi zone line) funneled into the Hanging Gardens area.  One day
my regular group was going to try a GoD expedition, but it actually turned
out to be a bunch of corpse runs in Barindu that got started when one guy
picked off by that mutt.

The last time I was in Ferubi I learned the hard way that a mob drops right
at the Riwwi zone-line.  One day I sat at the zone line scouting with my eye
of tallon, figuring I was safe as long as I didn't stray into the zone, when
something dropped me in a couple of rounds.  I thought maybe someone had
trained me, but that seemed unlikely because, as usual, Ferubi was a ghost
town.  When I zoned in to Riwwi to make sure my corpse was right at the zone
line, I saw a Nok Somethingorother pop right in front of me and then wander
into the zone (fortunately I was invis and this particularly mob didn't see
invis).  This was about the time, after many deaths just trying to get
around GoD, that I figured maybe this expansion wasn't for me.
