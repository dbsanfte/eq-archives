It starts to get easier when you get your level 8 and 12 pets and they
can tank for you instead of the other way round.

I have a human necro of Innoruuk and I'm fine everywhere in freeport.
And qeynos too. Mostly ok in erudin too although there are few NPCs
that attack me there. I was OK in nectulous too (apart from the
ghouls surrounding the necro guild there - they attacked me).

Guards don't care about the pet any more than they care about you.

At level 30 it's sometimes useful for finishing things off to save a bit of
mana,
but not otherwise. It's a slow decline, at level 20 I could still do
significant
damage.

At low levels you need to tank for the pet, just treat it as a low level DOT
spell. At high levels, the pet just exists to give you time to get your DOT
spells
off.

At level 30 I normally cast dooming darkness on the MOB (slows it right down
and is a feeble dot) to pull something. Then use "/pet attack" so the pet
hold
it off me. Then cast "boil blood" (major DOT) and vampiric curse (transfers
health from it to me) if I'm low on health. Then cast fear so that the pet
doesn't die. Then just wait, recasting fear if it breaks, or shock of
poison to finish it off quickly.

From about level 16 upwards that is the basic pattern (but with different
spells).

Fear is critical. But it gets more effective at higher levels.

It's hard in dungeons solo but in some you can survive. Fear isn't such
a good idea there and without it your pet tends to die shortly
followed by you.
