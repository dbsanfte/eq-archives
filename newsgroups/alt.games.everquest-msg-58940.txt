OK, I'll lower the bar even further. I got my key solo as a 40 druid. 
Ziglark is only something like level 27, easily soloable at this level 
(probably a huge melee undercon, but I don't melee stuff). The only problem 
is he has plenty of buddies helping him. You could get someone to single 
pull him to the zone or do as I did. Go in invis, whack Ziglark, run like a 
bastard to the zone (train in tow), root him at the zone, then zone out and 
zone back in to solo him, by which time his buddies should have wandered 
off and hopefully root has held and Ziggy is still there waiting for you.

Now, deliberately training a zone boundary is probably a bit antisocial, 
but this was after a couple of visits during which time all my polite 
requests for anyone with a key to help me zone out to CS were completely 
ignored. Eventually I just decided to leave all the other occupants of the 
zone to their uber-raid or whatever, and deal with it myself.
