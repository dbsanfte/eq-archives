took my pally  into EC and romped around killing as the zone was 
pretty much empty, with my baby warrior on autofollow invis vs 
undead so if the commander drops the staff or sword she can loot 
it. I think I had some necro following me around looting up the 
bone chips. I know i have 2 full 10 slot bags of chips, maybe i 
should take advantage of the event to work on cabilis faction=)

can a paladin of e. marr use an iksar illusion to turn in the chips?
