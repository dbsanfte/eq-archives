There are very good reasons why PVP isn't a part of the average EQ
experience.  Griefers outnumber the legit PvP'ers (or are at least far
more visible) and no online game has come up with a good way to
penalize them suitably that doesn't make PvP a wasted cause.

I've only seen one, that's one, MUD where PvP was unlimited and worked
for the most part, and that was because the admins would not hesitate
to boot any griefers.  There was also a very tight community.  Even
there, PvP still caused some problems.

I'll admit I often wish I could just kill the beggars and such around
me, but overall, I think the /dueling and arena systems, with a couple
of PvP servers, is the best plan I've seen so far.  Everyone can at
least try to play a server of the style they like, so I get to avoid
PvP altogether without telling others that they can't play the way
they want to.  :)
