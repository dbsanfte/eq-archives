As Graeme points out, that hat will be helpful until you stop using
Healing at L29 because you'll have Greater Heal.  And, for that
matter, the +WIS on the hat will still be worth a bit to you even
when you're not casting spells the the Focus effect works on.

I recommend that you do some "window shopping" in the Bazaar to
familiarize yourself with prices and availability of items on your
server.  Use the search tool with Druid and your race and Focus
effect (found in bottom drop-down) to see what focus effects are
available (beware of all the NORENT Magician stuff, it vaporizes
30 RL minutes after you log/LD).  Mana Preservation, Extended
Enhancement, Extended Affliction, Affliction Efficiency, Spell
Haste, Improved Healing, & Improved Damage are the most useful
Focus effects for a Druid, IMO (Healing and Damage tend to be both
rare and high priced tho).  Also, look for +WIS and +MANA by slot,
and be sure to consider HP and AC as well.  It takes some time,
best done over several visits at different times of the day, to
get a good feel for what is available, what is affordable, and
what is almost affordable and well worth saving for because it
would be a big upgrade.

Worth considering as well are several NODROP quest rewards, like
the "Fine Antique Ring" and the "Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid Mask"
quests from PoK.  Two things to consider about the Mask quest
(which you can do at L20) are that you might want to make sure you
have a friendly Necro available to summon corpse if your Sup. Camo
fails at the wrong time, and that the changes to Droga that will
shortly go live may make this quest extremely difficult and/or
impossible (dunno how the quest will be affected, but they're
raising the mob levels quite a bit, which seems unlikely to make
it easier).  For the Ring, it's usually not too difficult to find
all the quest bits for sale (go to Shar Vahl yourself to buy the
Tiny Rockhopper Eye for a couple silver off an NPC vendor rather
than paying some joker in the Bazaar 25pp for it), I managed to do
this quest at L5 for under 10pp with an untwinked Druid, which is
cheap for a ring with [3ac 30hp 20mana & Mana Preservation 2].

I suspect that you really will get the best results (and the most
personal satisfaction) if you research the gear/availability/prices
yourself, both on the web and in the bazaar.

good luck, hth,
kaev
