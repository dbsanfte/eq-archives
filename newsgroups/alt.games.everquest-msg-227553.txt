I have recieved many items via NBG over my time playing, and missed out 
on many items for the same reason.  I still generally find NBG in use in 
any group I am in including pickup groups, and still once in a while get 
something as a result.  It is admittedly quite rare now that anyone in 
the group actually needs an item that drops, in which case it is randomed 
as cash loot.
