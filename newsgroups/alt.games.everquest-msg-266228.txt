Ie, do you have ADSL, cable, dialup or are you using a peice of wet string 
with a tin can on each end? On your home computer this would be as well, 
unless you are an insanely lucky bastard who regularily gets to play games 
at work.

Can you tell I am getting excited about EQ2's release yet? Expect more 
stupid questions to come prior to release....
