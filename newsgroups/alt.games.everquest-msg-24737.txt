Tonight I killed a beggar. And I enjoyed it.

When about the third person in under ten minutes sent me a tell asking
for free stuff, I decided I'd have enough.

I told them that they should target me and type /d so I could cast a
few spells on them.

Naturally, when the begging noob challenged me to a duel, I accepted.
I think he understood his error quickly, as he started to back away
suddenly. I followed him into the heart of Rivervale. Going backwards,
he wasn't making very good time, and soon hit a wall.

Soon after that, I hit him. With a level 39 druid DD spell, that
turned him into a charred cinder.

Naturally, I had to leave RV very quickly as the guards all descended
upon me for killing a hapless little shorty, but they soon forgot
their anger and I was able to return to town.


Maybe, just maybe, he'll have learned a lesson from that. I was rather
hoping someone else would beg from me so I could take them to the
corpse and explain to them that this is what happens to walking scum.
