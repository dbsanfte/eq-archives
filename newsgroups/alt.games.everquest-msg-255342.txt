: If ripostes generate aggro there could be some indirect truth to it.

Actually probably no. Riposte agro is very likely due to the basic
damange-potential per swing agro.  The riposte disc, which is what I
am assuming is under discussion here, can by that method generate a
_HUGE_ amount of agro on an unslowed critter that's quadding very very
quickly.  Case in point.  I got asked by a guildy to go off an tank some
horrid BiC critter in Qinimi. some rat guy.  not easily slowable and at that
time had some really really ugly DPS he put out (max hit over 2k or something).
So anyways, we set up. I equip the ole Dathor Greathammer, plonk an arrow
into this guy, mash /disc furi and mr. rat dude didn't hit me one for 30s
took a *huge* amount of damage and I generated such a large amount of agro
right then that I didn't need to hit taunt or incite to keep it for the
remaining 2 minutes.
