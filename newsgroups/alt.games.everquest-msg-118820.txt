Personally I'd consider that a form of advertising.  Give the ones that get
you hooked, and let you know what you're missing.

Doesn't this remind you of the guy on the street trying to give you a
"sample" of something, knowing you'll want more and stronger?

In this country's crazy, ****ed up court system, maybe the next (just as
equally ****ed up) lawsuit brought against Sony will be from a drug dealer
claiming copyright infringement on the industry's advertising methods.
