Short answer is yes.

Don't recall off hand which side is the west side.  I work the side where 
the PoK book is.  Night or day, I pull the cliff golem out, usually get a 
goon, and sometimes the general as adds.  Golem runs slow, and gives up 
quickly, root goon, move a long ways off, sick pet on general, slow 
general, keep pet alive, keep general dotted (only one that sticks 
reliably is epic dot, only slow I've managed to land on him is disease 
based slow, after disease debuff).  Keep pet alive until general is dead.  
Head back to fort, goon will come running with cliff golem in tow, outrun 
golem, kill goon, easy at level 65, should be easy for your duo.  Go back 
again, kill cliff golem.  Now, the metal golems are easily single 
pullable, never have had an add.
