Talisman and Stamina buffs and druid Skin spells do not conflict with Symbol.
Skin does conflict with the -non- symbol cleric HP buff line (Heroism et all)

Talisman conflicts with many classes self only buffs, so Shaman must use their
judgement as to whether to cast on someone... with a Warrior as a main tank,
though, there's little to worry about there.

Main Tank = Main Assist.

Main Tank = guy who will be taking as much of the damage as can possibly
be arranged.

Main Assist = guy who you will be targetting and clicking your /assist hotkey
in order to pick your target... never ever pick your target any other way, and
always wait for him to call assist.

You may be thinking of SA, or Secondary Assist.  Thats basically the Vice
President of tankage, there to get aggro if and only if the MA dies... although
he'll also sometimes off tank unmezzable adds, kill off pets, and perform
other duties in violation of the sacred "only use /assist" to pick a target
rule.
