It wastes a spell slot though, which is a good reason to 
get SH up quick *g*  I usually throw it in with a 
'bash' key or something that I hit often.  What you do 
is:

1) Click on abilities
2) Decide which ability you want to bind it to and check 
the number
1 2
3 4
5 6
is the order it goes in.  So say sense heading is in the 
number 3 slot, and (hum I just looked at the druid list 
of skills - there *aren't* really many buttons that 
you're hitting constantly) say number 1 is "forage".  
Now click on "socials" and find a blank key (you have to 
hit the right arrow button to find one iirc).  Left 
click and hold until you get a grey box on your cursor.  
Release the mouse button and pull the box over to the 
bottom left hand side of your screen, where your 
'hotkeys' are.  Click on one of the empty ones and the 
grey box will place itself there (if it disappears, 
repeat the process - it does that sometimes).  Now, in 
your hotkeys, right click on the empty grey box.  Click 
in the 'name' area and name it ('forage').  Click to the 
first empty line.  Type:

/doability 3

and then on the next line type:

/doability 1

Then click "done".  Now you can hit that button whenever 
you go to forage and it'll practice sense heading as 
well.

If you ever do some fishing, you can bind sense heading 
to that in the same way, replacing /doability 1 with 
whatever ability button fishing is.  Fishing is a cheap 
way to get food or you can make a little money off it (a 
silver and change per fresh fish from most vendors), 
plus it keeps you from getting REALLY bored while 
waiting for boats.

BTW - for my enchanter, since I didn't have any 
hotbuttons I hit often enough to bind to sense heading, 
I just treat her like a warrior - I set sense heading as 
my second hotkey, which is 'bash' on my fighting 
characters, and whenever it pops up I hit it again.  
Works real well.  Plus I get the (dis)illusion that I'm 
a STRONG l'il thing :)
