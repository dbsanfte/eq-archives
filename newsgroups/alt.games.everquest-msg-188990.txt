My necro is up to level 29 and another necro that grouped with me suggested
we go to Qeynos to kill guards.  I declined as I had to log back into RL
soon, but have been thinking about it since.
My question is about the faction hit.  I don't really have a need to kill
guards (or to ever return to Qeynos for anything as far as I know), but if I
choose to is it a little faction hit or large?  I would guess enormous, but
never having done so I wouldn't know.

Sean...

GO BRUINS!
