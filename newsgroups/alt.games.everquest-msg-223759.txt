I do a mix of solo and group (6 active characters including a necro
and a druid) ... if you ever try and get a group at 10am on Saturday
morning in England on a US server you can see why!  I'm regularly the
only player in whatever zone I'm in (Except the Bazaar!).

Ignoring that for a minute though, both necros and druids seem to have
been designed primarily as solo classes ... surely you guys don't tell
them to group or leave the game?

My poor old druid has been taking a holiday lately. Just got the level
39 spells and very unimpressed.  No new heals (for grouping) or dots
(for soloing ... still using dots that necros laugh at).  Lots of
outdoor only spells (no good in LdoN) and loads of ports (that most
people don't use with LDoN and PoP).  The xp changes don't fire me up
with enthusiasm to get him back in the game either.

Does it get better for Druids at higher levels?

Cheers
