    If your guild is big into raiding, odds are they're 46 and up. That's
when you really start doing multi-group encounters. There may be others in
the guild who aren't that level, but the more focussed the guild is the more
unlikely it is. Really, why would someone want to be in a guild that they
never do anything with? Only reason I can think of is to chat, and you
turned /gu off. :-)

    Lots of those "low level" players in raiding guilds are just alts of the
character that's really required. And if the entire guild is lower level,
odds are they aren't raiding much and certainly aren't hitting "rare spawns"
with raids. "D00d, D'Vinn is up WITH A DIRK IN HAND! Get to CB now - we'll
