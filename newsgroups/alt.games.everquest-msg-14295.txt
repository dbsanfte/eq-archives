Depends a lot on what you have at your disposal I'd say.  Until I got
Remedy and then finally a copy of Celestial Healing the choice was SupH
or CompH and with well timed CompHs being much more efficient on those
with the hp to make use of it I tended to try to use it as much as
possible.   The thing to remember as a cleric using CompH is that you
can start at under two bubbles for a warrior and they will still be
around when the heal hits unless things are pretty dang bad, try that
with a rogue or a monk and you're likely to be healing a corpse.  A good
cleric makes it all look easy but there's a heck of a lot more to it
than just standing up and CompHing once in a while.  Which brings up the
question about the cleric meleeing, hehe.  No idea what that was all
about, I'll do it as a lark now and again if I'm really bored but
generally unless the group is very very efficient there's always room to
med just a little more and usually a need for that extra mana comes up
soon enough.
