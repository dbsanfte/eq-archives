1) Dell and Compaq are both terrible buys for a home user. They 
frequently use inferior proprietary parts to cut costs, rending them 
difficult and expensive to replace if they fail out of warranty, and 
often impossible to get drivers for if you decide to upgrade or change 
operating systems.

A local system builder can put together very competitive systems for 
less money, using standard 'brand name' parts (retail intel cpus, retail 
branded motherboards (from Asus/Abit/Chaintech/Epox/etc instead of OEM 
goofy ones) This benefits you as they tend to be better supported in 
terms of drivers, bios updates and so on.

Another huge advantage to buying from a local small system builder is 
the Windows OS you are are sold is not a co-branded peice of garbage 
which will only ever install on the DELL or Compaq you bought with it; a 
proper set of OS install discs and license is worth its weight in gold. 
If your Compaq dies and you decide to build your own PC from scavenged 
parts and a few new bits only to find your XP disc is really 'a system 
restore CD' instead of a proper install disc... you'll be pulling your 
hair out before you solve that one.

2) The comment about the RAM upgrade is on track. EQ uses around 750MB 
with everything turned on. Clearly a GB gives you lots of breathing room 
and futureproofs the computer a bit. But you can add that at any time, 
for a minimal cost so it doesn't matter that you don't have it now.

3) The video card unfortunately is weak. A geforce 3 would be a stronger 
card. That said its not *that* bad, but its not a gamers card by any 
stretch. That would be the first upgrade I make. Depending on your 
budget get a FX5200 thru FX5900. The 5200 of course is still pretty 
entry level, but its twice the card you are using. A 5600 is a decent 
compromise. Of course ATI makes a very solid line of cards too, though 
not quite as trouble free with EQ (mostly due to ATI tray-icon control 
panels iirc)

4) You probably got the welchia worm while updating your virus 
defintions. It is of that wave of worms which needs only be connected to 
an unpatched machine to infect. Be sure to do the windows updates, and 
run the virus again, and then follow that with housecall.antivirus.com a 
free online virus scanner, just in case your brief welchia infection 
damaged your on-disc virus scanner.

5) The v90 modem is likely an HSP modem, which isn't as big a deal now 
as it used to be becasue the 'H'ost cpu is much stronger these days, but 
for gaming you really want a non-HSP modem, but if your going to dsl its 
a nonissue.

6) Disregard the comments about the processor being weak 2.66 is plenty 
for EQ, but 2.66 sounds like a 533FSB, which is disapointing for a new 
computer for a gamer... 800FSB is really where you would want to be. Its 
not a big deal, though, and you'll be fine until this one is limping 3-4 
years from now... besides an upgrade here will not be cheap  as you are 
replacing the mobo/cpu/ram all at once. :)

Overall you didn't do to bad specs-wise at all; I hope you enjoy it :)
