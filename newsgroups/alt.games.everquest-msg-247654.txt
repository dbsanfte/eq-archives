 Which throws out the any ones caming a mobs because somene lower can
come along and say they can get more xp than you.

 I was looking for one piece and had my rng camped close by. Yes
everything else was rotting except the orc scalps as I use them for
faction in HKP/HHp

 I did that although there wasn't much traffic in the channel except
the hit messages. The first few were /ooc though. Was ignored.

 This was the minority.

 First off getting GM within 2-3 days is a miracle on my server. And
if this were to happen and the GM wouldn't listen to the 'I was here
first no one else was' arguement then these two would be marked in my
books. No heals, no buffs, no grouping. And I'd tell everyone else
what they did. This of course would have been before my actions.

 Yes but he didn't attack it did he? And he talked to you. These ones
didn't.
