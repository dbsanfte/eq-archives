It is different now, people are not queued up for the trials any more, 
it's mostly a BYOG thing now.  As for the quests, I have not actually 
completed any of them myself either, so I can understand that part.  I 
did get flagged for CoD and PoNB as well as PoV/PoS prior to them opening 
, and those, plus the Factory flag are all I have for now.
