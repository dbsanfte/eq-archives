I've been there once or twice. The problem I've had there is bad groups I'm
sure. One trip there was a nightmare! To start things off, the group didn't
stay together while travelling there, so I was screwed when I got attacked.
Then after I got killed trying to get there, I had an even worse time trying
to get my body back.  I about snapped when I got killed another few times
while getting my stuff off my corpse. Fortunately, I had a friend that
called in some high level support to help retrieve my body.

It's amazing how my experiences seem to be either one extreme or the other.
I seem to either have great groups with people that I want to play with
regularly (but seem to fall behind in level) or awful groups that frustrate
me and make the whole session a nightmare.
