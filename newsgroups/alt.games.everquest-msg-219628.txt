Well, actually it was a monk and a paladin.  But I'd already dissed monks and I
didn't want to do it again..... (it could have been ANY class.  Thats my point.
 We had a rogue in our group the other night, level 42, member of some *fly by
night* guild.  He turned out to be a NINE year old whose DAD had leveled the
character to 40 and made him part of the guild.  Kid had absolutely NO IDEA of
how to play the game, but his Dad had gotten him his Adventure Stone and told
him it would be the best place to play.  Of course we didn't find any of this
out until we were IN the dungeon.   Thanks Dad.).
