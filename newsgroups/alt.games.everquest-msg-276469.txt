Actually, rangers can sort tracking starting at level 1 (I just tried
it myself by creating a newbie ranger).  And of course rangers are the
only class that can sort their tracking list, plus being the only
class that can filter out certain colored /con mobs (e.g., they can
filter out green /con mobs so they won't show up on their list).
