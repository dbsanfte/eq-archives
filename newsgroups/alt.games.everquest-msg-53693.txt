 On the contrary, I feel if you are UNDER 18 you "have no business 
in this game!"

 A long time and frankly I don't care. "Getting laid" is not my #1 priority
in life, that is for 18 year olds such as yourself. I have better things to
do, and EQ is one of them. Grow up sir.

 My "life" is just fine the way it is sir. Do not presume to tell me how
to live it. Concern yourself with your "so-called-life. Grow up.

 Not me. Do not presume to tell me how to play "my game". If you spent "75%
of your time sitting on your ass meditating" you were doing something horribly
wrong and had no clue how to play whatever class you chose. Get a clue.

 You just don't quit do you? I am perfectly happy on the server I am now 
sir. Go the hell away and stay on that server. I'm extremely glad you're
NOT on my server you arrogant ass.
 
 Consider yourself killfiled. Don't bother replying I won't see it. If you
don't know why yet, you don't need it explained to you
