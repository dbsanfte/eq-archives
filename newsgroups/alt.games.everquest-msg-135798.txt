Did anyone experience a problem tonight (or rather last night since it's 
now 4:30am) where they could not cast spells? I was in the Lake of Ill 
Omen fighting with my group at the right ledge and I tried to cast a spell 
but could not. It would bring up the spell timer then instantly go away, 
but no message as to why. I soon realized everyone else in the zone could 
not cast spells either, and some claimed a GM told us to relog to fix it. 
I didn't relog, but just zoned and it fixed it. People in other zones had 
the same problem. What the hell caused that and was it just our server 
(Cazic-Thule) or many?
