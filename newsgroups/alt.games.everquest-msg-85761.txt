The people who bought DAoC on release and made it surpass AC didn't do
it to Level again they did it for a realistic world where PvP matters.
Unfortunately DAoC hasn't given us that yet. It has given us EQ style
leveling with less content. If I wanted to level against Mobs I'd
still be playing EQ. What I and most of the players who bought DAoC
wanted was and is a virtual world where we can fight the good fight or
be the evil troll warrior, where the battles make a difference.  Where
large scale RvR is possible, enjoyable and needed.  Large scale RvR is
a lag fest. Holding Keeps doesn't do squat.  RvR rewards are too small
to matter.
