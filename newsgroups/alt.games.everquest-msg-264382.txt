I haven't been on EQ in a few months and now when I try, I cannot get on.
It says it is a subscription issue.  However, checking my checking account,
the auto-pay for EQ was taken out this month so it shouldn't be.  I've gone
to their website, but don't see an email address to send a complaint to.
Anyone know the EQ email address that I can send an email to to get this
cleared up?
