I have a dumb question--when you put someone on your /ignore list, do
you also then not see the "moron01 invites you to join a group, click
'accept' or 'decline' box" message?  I also hate drive-by group
invites and always decline, so if I can add them to my /ignore list
and avoid seeing the group invite message that would be great.
