It could also be construed as meaning that the level increases come in 
Planes of Power *the expansion*, as opposed to the planes as a physical 
(or virtual, in this case ;) place. The 51-60 level increase came in 'The 
Ruins of Kunark', in the sense that, if you didn't own the box, you 
couldn't get to 60.
