VI has also been quite clear on the fact that a mob belongs to the first 
person to engage it. Normal players, though, usually abide by unwritten 
rules born out of common courtesy, like respecting other people's camps. 
VI's rules are determined as much by the necessity of washing their 
hands of possible CS nightmares as they are by what's right or wrong. 
And I'm sorry, but grabbing someone else's gear and running is wrong, no 
matter how you want to paint it.
