Killing the orcs doesn't. With a rogue, you could sneak/hide in behind
whatshername to turn in the bracelets and polar bear pelts. There
aren't any guards, to my knowledge, that wander close enough to aggro
and, once you're in, get behind her and drop hide but keep sneak up so
you can trade at "indifferent" faction. The only other NPC close by is
another merchant, and merchants don't go below Dubious (maybe some
rare exceptions, but I don't think Halas would be one of those).
