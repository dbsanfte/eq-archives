>You mention INT bonus but don't bother counting CHA?

Wanted to max int then start on cha. I knew I wouldn't max my cha, so I figured
I didn't need to bother with keeping count...

>If you know SolA well enough to find Kindle you should know it well enough
>to find the bartender.

/nod, I updated the list again too, and added "buy or camp kindle"...since
paying 25-50pp isn't much trouble for the legs.

>And you can do the moggok quest yourself

Yeah, but they're so easy to find...I'd rather spend the time camping some
other gear than reading up on it, etc.
