Doesn't the fact that decreasing demand makes fewer people
go out and farm the items, result in decreasing supply?  That
should bring prices back up, as long as demand remains constant.

I've seen this happen with the Stien of Muggok, as I wrote elsewhere
in this thread.  Prices were initially high, slowly dropped as people
found out how to do the quest, but then plummetted as characters
designed to farm the easy money were created.  The market
flooded, people stopped farming, and prices have now come back
up to the same levels I saw them at more than a year ago... if you
can find anyone selling at all!
