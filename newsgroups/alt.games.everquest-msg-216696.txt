They -say- they will do it.  But what they really mean is "we
won't guarantee we won't do it", and thats probably mostly in the
hopes that people who don't know any better will believe they
might, so if they are going overseas for a few months, they keep
the account open to save their characters.

I go to Arizona every year for 3 months, and have no internet
connection during that time.  I've tried it three ways; once I
quit the game and sold my account... only to come crawling back
on a whole new account about a month after getting back online. 
Once I shut the account down, no problem at all getting it back. 
And once I payed for the whole thing a year in advance, so
shutting it down wasn't an option, didn't really seem much more
expensive and its not enough dough to be worth the hassle.
