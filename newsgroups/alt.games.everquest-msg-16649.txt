I large sewing kit will hold giant sized items iirc, but they are eight
slots.  If you need ten slots and giant sized items, you need to make the
trip to iceclad ocean in SOV.  I don't know if trolls are kos to the gnome
pirates, but if you are it shouldn't be too hard to ask someone hunting near
the merchants to buy you a few.
