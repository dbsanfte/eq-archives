    Especially when they bug. For at least a short time, having two pet proc
weapons could lead to a really fun bug: if weapon B procced while the pet
from weapon A was up, the weapon A pet became permanent. That's no big deal
for the Whip of the Earthcrafter pet, but that Timespinner pet is pretty
nasty. What is he, hits for 200 or so, 20 K HPs, and is a ranger? We had a
ranger and shaman duo in Sol Ro's Tower farming, and they had the pet tank
everything.
