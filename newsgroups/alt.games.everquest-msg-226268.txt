Yabbut...being in the dye business, you wouldn't believe
the amount of people who come up to you and want you to
sell it at ridiculously low amounts. 'But, I only have
28plat5g3s2c. PLEASE sell it to me!' Yes, it's possible
that they could be trying to scam a good price, but I
think a lot really don't have much plat but will buy
dye just to look cool. (I, myself, didn't dye my armor
until I had sold a couple of thousand vials of dye, I
think. I was quite happy with my various shades of green
and brown (by accident, not by design) until I bought a
Cryptrobber's Chestplate and decided pink just definitely
did not fit in.)
