I've got a P2 450mhz, ATI Rage Fury, 512MB RAM and dialup.
I've got a 7200rpm 30GB HDD.
Running Win98SE
I've got all the models on and the only thing turned on is texture caching.

Zone times still seem slower than pre SoL and only SLIGHTLY better before
texture caching.

I wonder if there is a way of telling EQ to go to a RAM disk for the texture
files? It sure seems this would be a possible way of in effect keeping the
textures in memory. The only problem would be the management of the files
between machine boots. You'd have to have a process that would move the
files from your RAM disk back to HDD after you play and then move them from
HDD to RAM disk before you play. You could create a batch file simple
enough.

Anyone tried this?
