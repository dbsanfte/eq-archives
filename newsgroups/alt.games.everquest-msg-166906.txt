Wish I had a clue what these were in the first place, although I guess its just
as well I didn't, since they must have either been broken (that would have been
frustrating) or great and now nerfed (which would of course be frustrating now)

OUCH.  Well I never saw that happen, but that would have sucked.

More power to the beastlords!  Already a great underappreciated class high end,
and now a boost.  Nice.

Hmm, wish I knew what that meant, particularly as a bard is more likely to charm
mezed mobs than anyone ( I mean, the mez is going to wear off in 12 seconds at
most..)

Doh, a hidden benefit of my "my little pony" that I never got to try out... my
cleric should have been tanking black reavers in COM!

Never saw anyone with these critters, so didn't know it was a problem.  I
imagine this makes them more attractive though.

No clue what that means.  Smells like a nerf, but on a spell I never heard of.

There's a storyline?

What alternate methods?

Is trials an alternate method?  Cause they SUCK.  Is there an alternative to
trials?  I could sure use one!
