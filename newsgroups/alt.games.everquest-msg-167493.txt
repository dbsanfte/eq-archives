It seems on Karana, there are more chanters needed on the Organized "pick-
up" raids that span guilds.  Only one showed up for the last Vox raid.  
This council that does these raids is made up of a lot of small non-raid 
ready guilds, so maybe all the higher chanters are leaving for the bigger 
guilds.

Chanters can solo if you like charm soloing.  It's an interesting thing to 
do and a bit harder than the dr00ds have it with root-dot.

I play chanter because, in a typical group, there is never a lack of action  
unless your group has a spot where singles are common.  OT was just as 
boring for a chanter as it is for a cleric.  Then again, OT is just plain 
boring.  Find 5 intelligent people and go to Dalnir instead.

Chanters are like bards in that different groups provide different 
strategies.  Most of the time, you are CC.  Sometimes you are the nuker.  
What hurts is when you are CC, Slower, Haster, and Clarityer and everyone 
in the group is a caster and you have 3 hybrid melees.  Tough on mana.

I did a group the other day with me, a 33 Wiz, and a 41 Necro and we made 
EXP as fast as any standard group would.  I would pull with tash, let the 
mob hit me, my pet joined, necro added pet, I chain stunned, Necro dotted, 
after 50%, Wiz nuked.  Id' toss in my 510+ nuke now and then.  My lowest 2 
stuns take very little mana, and with all of us having KEI, it was too 
easy.  I like trying new groups make-ups like this.  While we were there, 
we got 2 Grimling Runners for the pack.

You can better group EXP as a cleric because you can get into groups at a 
lower level than a chanter will be able to in some cases.  Heals aren't 
resisted, whereas slow / chanter nukes / mez can be.

Both classes bring some authority with them.  As a chanter, I almost always 
end up being the "leader" of the group.  I'm the one who knows what mob 
should be take down next.  I give a lot of directions and if they are 
followed, everything goes smoothly.  Clerics love me because I save them 
mana by taking the mobs down efficiently and I save their asses when they 
mess up.  I've taught a lot of clerics what their "Atone" spell was, and 
MAN they love it when they learn it.  I still can't imagine getting to 40+ 
and NOT knowing how to use it, but instead of ridiculing them for that, I 
show them how it works and when to use it.  Tanks love me because people 
don't die in my groups, if people listen to me.  I do a hell of a job as a 
chanter, and people appreciate playing for 4 straight hours with non-stop 
killing, no deaths and fun banter while we play.

If you're a type-B and don't like to be the one in charge, chanter probably 
isn't for you in your higher levels.  I have a VERY low tolerance for 
idiocy, and have to contain myself sometimes when people aren't listening, 
but I give them a couple chances to learn good techniques.  The second 
someone starts backtalking, if I am not the actual leader of the group, I 
send a tell to the group leader telling that that they can either have me 
or them, it's their choice because I'm more insterested in having a fun EXP 
machine than banging heads with a warrior who wants to fight 2 mobs at once 
because "we can".  Or a melee who isn't the MA that -likes- keeping aggro 
to prove he can.  Or a Wizzie that wants to bump up their defense so she 
nukes early.  Or a Necro that thinks fearing an add is the correct form of 
CC in a dungeon.  Or... well, you get the picture.

As a Cleric, you also have a hold on the group if you are the only healer.  
If you can't heal, they can't EXP / live, so you control when the group is 
ready for a pull, assuming you are fighting mobs that are going to require 
MA healing.

I think most Clerics are more boring then most Enchanters at least at the 
sub 35 levels.  But, they don't have to be.  You have stuns and more 
importantly, roots.  A cleric that knows how to use Root for CC is a nice 
cleric, IMKAO.  I can't get myself to play a Cleric because they seem 
boring early on.
