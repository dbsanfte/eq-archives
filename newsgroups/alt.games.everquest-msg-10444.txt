Hmm, there usually isn't anyone near the MT ring. Was it Ella
Foodcrafter?
I suspect killing unkempt druids in Rathe mountains might help.
Otherwise, the only really dangerous rings are WC and NK, and just
invising the 'bad' group members will get them there safely. Also,
I've ported 50+ 'bad' characters to WC visibly; at that level, the
ring druids are so green they no longer aggro.
