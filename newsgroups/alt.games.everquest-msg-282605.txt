Alot. :) What you seem to try is organizing an event *not* a raid. A
raid usually is a coordinated effort to accomplish a set goal. Running
around in a city an having fun does not count. ;) I won't say it is a
bad thing but trying to make it a raid will probably be a desaster.

The reason is people expect the raid leader to actually lead. If you are
just fighting around for fun the whole raid will go on its own. After
all there are no goals just killing guards and such.

If on the other hand you want to organize an event then good luck. It's
way more effort to get that together as you probably need to organize
both forces. After all I doubt the high level crowd would have much
trouble with cities. That depends on the size of one team obviously. But
it certainly can be alot of fun. :)

My whole point is: try to make up your mind what you really want to do!
Is it a raid? Choose a target. Is it an event: try organizing the teams
and set up rules.
