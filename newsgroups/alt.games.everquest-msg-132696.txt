No. And was never stated as such. Who rattled your cage? My argument was
that it is possible to type an obsenity without a second thought, or haven't
you been following the thread?

I see, you're basing your statement on no facts whatsoever. I don't know how
many people that play EQ can/are touch-type/typists. I'd wager it's more
than your lowly figure.

And if you don't think it's possible, you need to expand your horizons.

Besisdes. Why don't you take you own advice and slow down a bit. You are
manifestingly yourself as the very same person you lambast.
