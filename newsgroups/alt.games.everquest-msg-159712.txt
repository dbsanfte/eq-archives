My skins break around every 3rd patch (not counting POP fix patches and 
maintenance patches). Dont know why, friend run same version i do, he 
dont have problems.
This time i could log chars on, then when zoning or logging in next i 
crashed. Removed skins in the UI ini file, then reloaded in game, no 
crash. Zone after reloading, crash, and crash every time i try to log 
char on, untill i removed the skin again.

Skin a direct file copy of friends skin, and it works fine on his comp.

Fixed last 3 times it happened:
Delete own skin files, get copy of friends skin files, identicaly to my 
own, same file size and edit date. Replace my version with his, problem 
solved, go figure.

Just got a copy of his again today, havent tested it yet, but guess itll 
fix my skin again.
