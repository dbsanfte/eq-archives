My computer locks up when i play eq. It might be a coincidence but it's
happened ever since the last major patch. I get white flashes and can see
through the walls to other vendors, then the mouse freezes... sometimes
ctl-alt del breaks the lockup but i'm not actually closing any process/task.

I have the latest drivers, my system is designed to shutdown at the merest
hint of overheating, and was stable for over a year, and in many cases was
on continuously for over a week before this problem occurred. Now it crashes
minutes or hours after login, and I'm finding it impossible to sell
anything. It's a real shame as I was making a K a day before.

I really wish they had gone with the offline model for the bazaar rather
than requiring a mule to stay logged in chewing up bandwidth/isp costs! I'm
glad that star wars galaxies has the offline approach.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I contacted eq tech support and they were
unhelpful, merely looking for excuses to ignore me, as always.
