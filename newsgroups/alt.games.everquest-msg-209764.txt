Depends mostly on when the newbie quests were implemented. The *really*
old ones (iksar and vah shir) seem to rely heavily on rare NO DROP items
that you use tradeskills on, with trivials in the 20-40 range, and failure
eats the items. The mediumish ones (human, gnome, elf) were about 25% NO
DROP items (generally at least one NO DROP ingredient per piece) and no-fail
tradeskill combines. The really recent ones (frogloks) have almost no NO
DROP items -- maybe about 2 out of 40 items for the full set of frog/wizard
gear. I'll admit I haven't done *all* the newb quests of all the races
yet, but I've done a few...

For my 2cp, I'd make 90% of the drops for newbie armor common and not NO
DROP. On a lot of the older quests, I was camping quest mobs long after
they were green in order to get the rare NO DROP bits I was looking for.
What fun, not! There's also the annoyance factor of killing a mob with 5
or 6 items on it, each of which brings up a "you already have one of these
LORE items" or a NO DROP confirmation box. Could they make killing a
skeleton any more time consuming?
