At the moment, yes, you can sell it for close to 1k.
The guy that sold it prolly did by accident, vendors only pay 30pp for a
mith2hder, yes did this myself, should make sure I am actually awake before
selling at a vendor, cost me 500+ to get it back.
Funny how the low end kunark 2hders sell for 900pp plus and are crap in
comparison (I'm talking treeflayers and axe of iron back type of 2hders)

A level 30 melee will wield this weapon as a 21/31 weapon and still get the
2hd bonus to damage (it still is a delay 40 weapon)

Given that you'd only make around 300pp profit on the sale I'd keep it.

CF
When I sold my Mith in error they were going for around 2k and I'd paid 1k
for mine, so paying another 500 odd didn't really cost me, I just didn't get
the bargain I thought I had :ï¿½)
