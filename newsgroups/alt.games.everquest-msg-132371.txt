I have heard some rumors that attempting things a few steps higher up
helps.
I have also heard that you should always do things 5 higher than your
skill
There are also various other magic number theories.

I have little data to back any of them up.
From my experience (Jeweling up to 103) gems one above the lowest
possible seem to get slightly faster increases, however you loose more
cash due to more fails and higher cost.

Every thing that I have seen suggests that getting Int to 255 is the
best way to reduce costs (by getting more increases). Whats you current
Int and what can you afford to spend on rasing it ?

HTH,

Jim
