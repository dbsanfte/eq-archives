Hardly given your writing skills and viewpoints. I'm sure you've heard
it a lot. In truth, I know you are older than four. I can't tell if
you are a young teen or older and stupid, not that it matters.

 You are also the first person I have ever seen claim to be a system

I don't care if you believe me or if you care. I have a opinion on how
system admin should be run. In this case it is the job I do, so some
people might consider that important, some not. Hard to believe that
someone would make something like that up, but I'm sure it happens.

Did you you that before writing this? Thought not. However, I'll be
the first to admit that this reply is as useless to the newsgroup as
yours is. At least my comments on system administration do fit
somewhere into the topic.

It is interesting how many different types of people like the same
game. While I think Verant has terrible support, the game is great.
I'm not running to DAOC or AC like some people.

BTW, in case you missed it. 3:00pm eastern, or 12:00 PST has come and
gone and still no EQ. I do want them to get it right before coming up,
but you have to admit that the estimates they give are not usually
very good.
