MT is Main Tank, MA is Main Assist.  In an XP group, yes, same thing; you
seldom have two tanks worthy of the name.  On a raid, not necessarily.  For
example, if you're doing giants (unmezzable) and end up with two in camp,
the MA may grab one and the MT the other; in this case, the MT (who should
be the toughest tank) is 'off-tanking' to keep one giant busy and the MA (a
tough tank, but not necessarily THE toughest) is being assisted by everyone
to get his mob killed FAST.

Generally, the MA is the one all the damage dealers should be assisting for
target, and the MT is the one who should be taking all the damage.  MA and
MT coordinate what order things need to die.
