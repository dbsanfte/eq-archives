[Top post fixed]

I was watching this thread to see the answer to this myself. I've fished
fairly recently in CS for a friend, and Cobalt Cod was the only "rare"
there that I knew of. With extra gear I can get an effective fishing
skill of 210 (and I don't know of a way to get it higher) and I never
caught one of these.

To the OP... are you sure you weren't fishing in Western Wastes?
