The seb key is currently not needed, but no announcement to that
effect has been made.  I assume this is an unintentional glitch on
the part of VI.

I haven't tested HS, nor have I heard its broken in the same way.

Course its possible that all "key required" zones are now broken,
which would be amusing, see mass tours conducted of VP and
Vex Thal

I would not be at all surprised to see this fixed on the next patch,
or the next, or the next.  I'd be a little more surprised to see
an announcement that keys are no longer needed... but this
wouldn't be outside the realm of possibilty either, they
killed the need for the various teeth to port to velious
rings, after all...
