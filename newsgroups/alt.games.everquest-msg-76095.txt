Verant's Character Naming Policy includes, but is not limited to the
following:

"The following types of names are unacceptable and are listed in order from
worst to least offensive: ..."

"7. Proper names from EverQuest (e.g., Rathe, Karana). This also includes
any name of a significant EverQuest NPC (e.g., Dorn, Trumpy, Karn)."

And also,

"12. Popular and easily recognized names from existing media (e.g., Merlin,
Gandalf, Belgerath, Tanis)."

"For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the word or
words are also unacceptable."

Ok, now then...  Since Verant is SO on top of things...  LOL, My guess is
that they just got a new GM who finally actually READ the rules and decided
to enforce them.

Nobody working as a GM gave a damn before apparently.  Now, maybe they will
actually start cracking down on the numerous Drizzt Do'Urden names out there
as well as the LOTR names that are cropping up.  Prolly not though and I'm
gonna venture to guess that you were simply in the wrong place at the wrong
time and a GM finally decided to say something.
