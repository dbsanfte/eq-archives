I'd start by working on breaking the problem of most 50+ camps
requiring cleric, chanter/bard, tank, druid/wizard, and then two slots
being left for everyone else. Do this by:

Give druids a 51+ mezz spell and necros a 49 or so upgrade to
Screaming Terror with a shorter recast time.

Make pet taunt much more effective. If taunt is turned on, let pets
take the focus off of monks and rogues more easily.

Lower the level for paladin no-XP rez. Give necros a level 49 no-XP
rez with a 100-plat or so reagent.

Give shamans better heals at 55+.

Similarly, make it easier to get a low-level group for chanters and
rogues. Buff up chanter pets. Give rogues backstab at level 1.

Up warrior damage. Warriors have been becoming less and less
differentiated from hybrids.

While I'm at it:

Add more static and dynamic quests. There should be more to life than
XP / Raid / Epic.

Give options for raising far more factions.

Create craft-based uses for many more of the random drops.
