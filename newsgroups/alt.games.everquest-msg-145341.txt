Thanks all for all the support.  Looks like we're both going to live. 
Lenny is hobbling around, and is at the mercy of the kitten who is
stoked that he's all defenseless.  The police haven't called us back, so
it looks like the bad guys are at home, cursing at the cracker on the
bike that caused all the front end damage to their car (and there was
alot.  Yes, it is a comfort to me) and laughing about the fat bitch they
punched out.
  But I am no longer mad at the universe.
