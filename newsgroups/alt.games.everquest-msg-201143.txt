Heya all,

I am mapping out the upgrades I want to get for my monk... I am going from 
this:

to this:

Weapons are still a bit up in the air. I hope to find a Staff of Waters for 
sale, but failing that I will probably get an Entwood mace and a Khasheks 
Katar.

Anyone else have any other comments or suggestions?
