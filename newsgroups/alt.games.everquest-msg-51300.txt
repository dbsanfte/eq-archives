Trouble is, most of the online quest sources don't actually
tell you what faction you'll need, and at what level, to do a
quest, unless its something unusual.

Most of the people doing the Halas quest VJF mentioned are
barbarian rogues... they have no trouble.  Its fairly easy, in
this instance, to guess that the faction you'll need is white
rose (I think thats the one, been a long time, anyway the
barbarian rogue's guild faction) but hard to say whether
Dubious, Apprehensive, Indifferent... heck, some
quests require Amiable, Warmly, Kindly, even Ally!

There are a -lot- of mobs that can be forced to regard you
with indifference, via wolf form or getting invisibility cast
on you after you hand over the item but before you click
give.  Quests that require better than indifferent are relatively
rare, but much harder to defeat casually.

You should pay particular attention to this when multiquesting
(which is to say more than one person handing in various
no-drop parts of a quest) as if -any- of the people handing
in parts aren't sufficiently well factioned, the whole thing is
a waste of time.

Well, not a total waste.  Quest givers have a memory, if
you hand in part of a quest, they will often wait hours,
even days if noone else is doing anything with them for
the rest of the parts.  Rush out and get that missing piece
quick and you might manage to not have to do the rest
of the quest stuff over.
