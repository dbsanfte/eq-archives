It looks like 51+ EXP give me a good reason to just have fun and not worry 
about TheBar(tm).  Time to finish those shawls.  Time to explore some more 
in EXP zones.  Time to think about that epic that I will never have.  Time 
to get some cash for upgrades ( more on this in a later past ).

I can always play the Warrior again if I want to see some bar movement.
