Sorry DT, but knowing zones/mobs/tactics is what gives meaning to simple
statistics about a class.  And knowing these things and how they apply
to a particular class first-hand (doing it) is better than second-hand
hand (seeing it while playing another role) is _worlds_ better than
third-hand (reading a spoiler).  Martin is right-on here.

In many cases it means you don't know anything useful about them, which
might as well be the same thing in this context.

We're not talking theoretical physics here DT, the "knowledge" of which
you speak has value if it cannot be applied.

Um, yes you do.

In that case you do _not_ know everything there is to know about pianos.

No they don't.

No, they can't.  Unless, of course, they've already played a character
of that class up into the high-end game.

Has nothing to do with elitism.  OTOH, your insistence that knowledge
acquired out of context is equivalent to knowledge that comes from
experience in context looks pretty pig-headed to me.  In either case
the knowledge must be incomplete, nobody can know "everything", but
do you really believe that the knowledge acquired by reading a list
of spells is equivalent to the knowledge acquired by using the same
spells in-game in a variety of contexts?  You can go ahead and try
to argue semantics (abstract vs. applied), but it'll just be a load
of bullshit.  I don't know everything there is to know about playing
a L55 Paladin.  Why?  because there are still situations (zones, mobs,
and group & raid makeups for those zones & mobs) that I have not
experienced anything truly equivalent to.  Until/unless I go to those
zones (or similar) and fight those encounters (or similar) I cannot
honestly say that I know how to play a L55 Paladin there.  I have a
pretty good clue and can be reasonably confident that applying tactics
and techniques I've learned elsewhere will be effective, but I don't
_know_.  There's a difference.  And that difference is magnified x100
for random_twentysomething_player01.
