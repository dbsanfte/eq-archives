Hey, thanks Richard! Good timing on that since we got caught up in a PoV 
group last night and didn't get the other folks who were going to help 
until too late in the evening. Going to try it today. I think we're 
going to have my little cleric, a 55 cleric, 65 ranger, and 63 wizard. 
Hoping it will go smoothly.

Cheers!
