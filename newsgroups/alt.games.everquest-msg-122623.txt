I'm sorry, but the person listening still has to decide to get mad.
They do have a choice. 

Vaguely related note: check out NIGGER: THE STRANGE CAREER OF A
TROUBLESOME WORD, by Randall Kennedy.  Very interesting book.

Yeah, words do have meaning, but it's up to the listener how they are
going to react to those words.

WHAT differences are in the meaning of the word 'fuck' from the
meaning 'copulate'?  Assuming you're using it talk about sex.  If I
hit my thumb with a hammer and yell "FUCK!", it's probably NOT because
I've been overwhelmed by the desire to have sex.  If somebody makes me
mad and I tell them "Fuck you", it's not because I want to have sex
with them, it's a simple dismissal.  

If I'm surprised by something and say, "You got to fucking be kidding
me?", am I talking about sex?  Why is using the word 'fucking' in that
context any worse than using the word 'freaking'?

I need to get a copy of Lenny Bruce's HOW TO TALK DIRTY AND INFLUENCE
PEOPLE.  Haven't read that since high school. :-)

ANYWHO, it's been my experience that I just can't make other happy or
sad.  Comfortable or uncomfortable.  They are going to feel what they
want regardless of how I try to make them feel.  So if it comes right
down to it, the only persons feelings I can control are my own.

>Anyway. Dead topic I think. I dont see you converting any time
>soon. ;)

Come on.  They horse ain't dead yet.  A few good whacks will put it
down though.
