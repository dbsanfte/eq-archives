You access the router through its internal web server, I forget the address,
something like 192.168.1.1

Eveything is in there including the firmwave version.

When I got my BEFSR41 the first thing I did was upgrade the firmware, and I
have had no router related problems at all with EQ or anything (the cable
modem, well, that's another matter :P)
