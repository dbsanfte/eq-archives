Depends on your terms... obviously it wouldn't be "rounding" in the
normal sense, but it might make more sense to people to not have a 0%
mob still alive.  Like those maddening installs of software that say
"0% remaining" and then grind for 10 minutes.  Maybe it wouldn't be
any faster, but you'd have some feeling that there was some
rationality to the universe if it said "1% remaining".

Depends on whether or not you're the kind of person who likes to fill
up the gas tank and drive as far as you can to see what the needle is
on when the tank is really empty.  If you are like me, you think that
when the needle is on empty, the tank ought to be empty.

(and yes, I understand rounding and truncating very well, I have to
deal with them fairly often at work... but this is also one of the
kind of issues that our customers might complain about, so I
understand human factors as well).
