And you deal with the general public?
I can't believe you've not come across anyone that you don't consider to be
stupid.
Of course there is a difference between being stupid and having a lack of
knowledge and to tech support that line often gets greyed out. On top of the
stupid and uneducated there is just plain lazy "I'm not going to read the
manual I want you to tell me how to operate it"

No that person will make an adequate support tech who can repeat what he/she
has learnt without actually thinking of why that problems arrise.

True, I remember one of my staff put a customer thru to me as he was
"foreign" and couldn't be understood.
He was from Birmingham (our office, at the time was based in Laindon, Essex)
Yes dealing with people who are irrate is a skill, it is actually easier to
deal with people who are stupid.

The main reason for frustration in a helpdesk enviroment is not the customer
(although some are downright unreasonable) it is normally the inability to
help the customer or having failed that customer due to another failing
within the company whether it was the stores, shipping or engineer it is the
Customer support who take the brunt of it and have to sort it out.

Think you misunderstood the post or the poster. I'm sure Rastus wanted to
let off some steam but if anything this post was for our amusement.
