So you got one of the class defining spells for clerics :)

Yes, 10 seconds, asfaik.

: How do I use this one?  Better yet - when?  

Always. The only thing you have to do is to learn when to cast it.
You have to learn how much health a tank loses in those 10 seconds,
so you can time the CH to hit when your tank is just around 1 bub.
This is for tanks, though.Classes like me (shaman) die way to fast
when attacked at level like 50+, we need your fast casting celestial
healings etc. Later in game, in raids, you will have to learn
about the CH-Chain - clerics casting CH in 3-6 second intervals,
depending on the mob you fight.

If your *tank* dies way to fast for a CH, then you clearly overpull.

: During a typical grind session, I'm in a 3 or 4 person group FAST
: pulling blues, so the tanks don't get beat down too much and Superior
: Heal works just fine.  Obviously, its not needed there unless I want

Don't use it, especially not later. Tanks will get so many HP's
(our level 55+ tanks in good armour have more than 6000 HP's buffed).
CH will be much much more mana efficient. I'm a 54 Shaman and have
superior healing as well. I can't compete the *slightest* with a cleric
on tank healing. We do very well on keeping casters alive, though,
a thing you'll use celestial healing a lot for.

: to run the tank(s) down over the course of a few pulls, then CHeal
: 'em(?).  

That's what you do .. if the situation is not extremely dangerous (i.e.
relatively safe pulling spot) you let tanks go down to 1 bub and use CH.
Makes much better use of your mana.

: Is it more mana efficient?

A lot. Especially later.

: Did I say that long cast time scares me?

Nah it doesn't. But you have to learn how to use it. On raids on super
mobs like dragons, vindicator, tormax etc, where you need 30 - 60
people, depending on items, skill etc of the guild, clerics start casting
CH before the mob did his first hit (CH chaining I just mentioned).
