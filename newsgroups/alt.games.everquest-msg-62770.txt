No.
They want you to buy it so it would be pretty darn stupid of them to
let you still display the new graphics just by installing it wouldn't
it? Your account has to also be registered for Luclin with the Luclin
cd key which is useable only once on any account.

No, it doesn't "replace" the current models. You have a choice in fact
of which new models you display. If you are, for example, a female
wood elf playing in third person view and just want to be able to view
your own more detailed ass running around you can just enable wood
elves showing the new model and leave the rest as old. The sys req faq
states that you can do that with 256 meg of ram or more but as they
later explained no Luclin feature will be "turned off" if you don't
have the horsepower for it. You can go ahead and turn everything on
and get one frame per second if you want to do so even with a low
memory system. 

The only Luclin graphic you'll see without Lucin registered on your
account is the vah shir model. Everyone will see the same model for
that.

Usually they ship them on the release date or possibly before if
verant allows. Verant certainly has a day that they can ship them on
which they can't ship them on before that date even if they already
have them in stock I'm sure.

The same way, you don't get the stuff such as the new velious textures
without being registered for velious.
