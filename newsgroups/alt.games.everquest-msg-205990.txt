    There's a quest NPC in Lake of Ill Omen, an Iksar who should /con
indifferent. Near the shore, straight out from the Veksar zone. He wants
four of any of the steel weapons from Veksar. Any four of the same type will
do, and in addition to some coin he also gives out faction boosts to every
Iksar faction except the necromancers. So you can get XP and work on faction
at the same time.
