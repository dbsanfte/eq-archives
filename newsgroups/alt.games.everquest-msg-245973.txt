Don't be an idiot.  You cannot even get the Intricate Wooden Figurine until 
level 51 or so.  You can always replace your adventurer stone, so, put it 
on whatever charm you can get now, and later on, when you get a better 
charm, such as the Intricate Wooden Figurine, get a new stone (It will 
retain all the stats from the adventures you have completed), and attach it 
to the new charm.
