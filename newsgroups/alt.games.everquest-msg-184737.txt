Droool..  MEAD... love it...(Great Pagan Drink)
My favorite market mead was Merrydown, but I cannot find them any
more.  Chaucers is about the only other one I have found, and yes it
is rather koolaid like compaired to the merrydown, but eh... take what
you can get.  I dont have the patience, space, and time to make my
own.
