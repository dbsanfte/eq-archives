Last night I was relaxing, camping Sorceress Gnildaria for her crystal
ball, and listening to Xev's auction chat channel, when I saw a 24th
ranger ask the auction channel what a good last name would be.  Suggetions
were thinks like "diesalot", "Isuck", "wasteofbandwidth", and the
like...as far as I could tell, these weren't personal slurs, but good old
fashion ranger bashing. What stunned me is that so many people responded
independently with names like this.

I have died very little during my career as a ranger, really. No more or
less than anyone else.  A *lot* of my friends are rangers, and they don't
seem to be especially prone to death either.  All of us play our class
relatively smartly, and while I may have been the most obsessively focused
on ac/hp gear throughout my entire career, I'd not say any of us were
outright flimsy.

So what's the deal then?  I'm asking this of the non-ranger classes out
there.  ARe there a lot of stupid people playing rangers these days, thus
enforcing the reputation of us as utter wimps, or is all this hate just
residual from waaaay too many expansions ago?  You'd think it would be out
of fashion by now, which is why I have to suspect that something, like
stupid players wanting EQ/AM3 overnight, is enforcing it.
