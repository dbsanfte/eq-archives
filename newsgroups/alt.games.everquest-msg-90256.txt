/tracksort distance.

But only Rangers can do it.

Available options are:

   normal       (sort with newest mobs showing up on top)
   distance     (sort by distance, nearest on top)
   consider     (sort by "consider" color)
   rdistance    (reverse sort by distance, farthest on top)
   rconsider    (reverse sort by "consider")
