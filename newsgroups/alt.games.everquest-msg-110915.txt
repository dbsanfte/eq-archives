I have a suggestion about the best two person group in Everquest.  If you
are willing to switch from the Wood Elf race and start a pair of Barbarians
then the Warrior/Shaman combo cannot be beat.  I think you can also do a
Troll Warrior/Shaman or a Ogre Warrior/Shaman combo but since I have never
played an evil race I do not know if those are possible.  The reason for
this combo is that for a strictly 2 person team a cleric really is not an
option.  Clerics are great in groups.  There are none that are equal to them
when it comes to healing and curing stuff.  But if you are planning on
staying with only two people then the Shaman's healing abilities coupled
with his ability to do some good damage makes this class very attractive.

I have heard many a Druid get upset about people wanting Shamans in their
groups.  They are all the time saying that Druids are equal to Shamans.
From first hand experience I can tell you that Shamans are a Warrior's best
friend.  At higher levels they gain a pet.  They gain the ability to
Cannibalize their Health in exchange for Mana.  They gain the ability to
create SOW potions and other items that can be sold.  Also with the Luclin
expansion they gain a spell that allows them to take on the form of a
Grizzly Bear.  Only thing Druids have that Shamans do not get is Cool
Teleports and Evac spells and the ability to Track.  But Druids also suffer
harsh penalties when they go underground into dungeons.  Most of their
spells do not work in Dungeons.

Of course if a Ranger is what you want to play then more power to you.
Rangers are the games best trackers and they get some pretty good spells.
They also get Duel Wield like Warriors do.

Another combo that is good to play is a Monk/Shaman.  Only problem here is
Monks are limited to either the Lizard Race or Human Race.  Could take a
Human monk from Qeynos and hook up with a Barbarian Shaman from Halas.
