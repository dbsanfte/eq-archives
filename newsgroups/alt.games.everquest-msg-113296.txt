It's not that the buff is in and of it self a big deal, it's getting
asked for it ALL THE FUCKING TIME!  And I mean that literally.  If you
go unanon, you will receive at least one tell every 10 minutes or so
asking/pleading/begging for some kind of buff/Tp.  And that's only if
you play at 2am, like I do.  At peak times, expect tells from people
in OTHER ZONES asking for ports.

There is a certain segment of the druid community that can be safely
labeled as 'morons'.  Druids attract them with their seeming ease of
use.  Necro's see a fair amount of this type of player.  That said,
ANY player can get burnt out on giving buffs after so long.

/auc'ing for the SoW will, more than likely get you a free SoW from my
experience.  Personally, if I see someone offering to pay for a SoW, I
will, if I'm not busy go out of my way to give them one and NOT accept
payment.  I know others that follow this same belief.  

I see /auc'ing for something like an acknowledgement that somebody
might actually realize that people don't play druids for the sole
purpose of buffing every single random individual who wants 'em.  It's
a courtesy to others.

Hell, just send an /ooc asking for a SoW, and letting them know you're
willing to go to them, and you'd probably get a better response.
Sending a tell like that is marginally rude.  A bit of an intrusion.
Not a large scale offense by any stretch of the imagination, but it
counts against people, IMHO.
