Coffins are handy for just about any raid of this level until you learn
what you're doing.

We make do with a 58 and a 56 as backup.  We haven't had any
problem with that so far.

Yes you certainly need a rogue.  Monks can handle the CR, though, as
long as people all make it through the locked door.  We haven't had
that problem and the rogue is available if you do.

Pulling high-level mobs that you haven't done before is "interesting."

Our monks pull him.

You shouldn't need that for *one* kill but probably will for two or
more.  It's a "good to have."

DMF isn't needed but a necro that can use stackable coffins is highly
desired...

If it's not, turn around and come back when it is... ;)

We single- or double-pull them quickly so it's not "virtually impossible."

We pull those two up top and kill them first.  And pull from the last
room before the King & Queen as well before moving.  We try to avoid
killing anything on the move that we can avoid unless they're just
fodder.

> At this point the necro DMF's *everyone*. Why?

Because you want to waste time and mana?  The pit trap is on one
side;  people stay on the other side.  Problem solved.   "/ooc STAY ON
THE LEFT SIDE" takes a lot less time and mana than having a
necro DMF a whole Overking raid.   We do this move by killing the
mobs in front of the raid the move group by group invis'd past the
pit trap.

We set up camp in the north room before the hallway leading to
the King and Queen rooms.  We pull the Overking room until the
King is left alone, same as you're suggesting.   Now you rush the
room and explain the danger of doing so.   It's a LOT easier just
to pull him.  The initial monk will probably die but the second
monk will pull him into the room.   And then you don't need to
worry about the gravity flux problem.

All the DA pull is for is to avoid an XP death which will probably
happen anyway for some of the raiding party.   Even that's "ok"
if you want to do it that way but there's no reason why it's
required.  But I'd certainly pull him farther out instead of
rushing him.   As you point out, the gravity flux is a problem.
So avoid the problem by pulling him out of the room.

The keys (for us) are simple:

a) two-monk pulling team that pulls almost everything we raid.
They work very well together and their learning curve for new
situations is very short.

b) never kill mobs on the move that you can pull to a "safe"
spot.  Killing-on-the-move implies a lack of preparation and
control is needed.  Mobs aggro who they want instead of
who we want, etc.  Pulling good;  not being in control of the
situation bad.

c) assume that anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
It only takes one person getting moved up to the ceiling,
for instance, to aggro the upper mobs, training the raid
and, probably, getting everyone killed.  So don't put the
raid in a situation where it can happen when someone
moves around for a better look or a rogue tries to get
behind him, etc.

Other than that, though, it sounds good to me.
