Yeah, win/loss record is ultimately meaningless. Your group failing
doesn't always mean *you* did something wrong (besides maybe choice of
companions). Like I said before, I doubt many people beyond the
egocentric really give a rat's ass about the stupid leader board
thing.

Of course, I can still easily imagine FoH adding a "rank" requirement
on the leaderboard to their membership requirements...
