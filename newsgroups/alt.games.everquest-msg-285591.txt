Berserkers rock!  Most fun class I've played since the monk of Old
World.  55 troll berserker with epic 1.0.  GET SOME!

Clerics are fun.  Easy to get groups.  Decent DPS; hammer (proc's like
a machine gun), DD aa's, nukes.  can tank a little with melee aa's,
but still gets a whoopin in higher end zones (gear blows goats).  But
I can crit nuke for over 4k and crit proc for over 400; not bad for a
cleric.  All my healing aa's and I crit CH for 19+k, and with Gift of
Mana....ooohhhh how I love Gift of Mana!

Had a Relic group the other night (started off as an arcstone group
but no one had the quests from relic) and after getting the quests we
tried to take out a runner.  We got our asses handed to us.  3 of the
group were mo's, the other 2 left after the first wipe as it was
obvious the other 2 were mo's.  They may have thought I was too, who
knows.  Moron paladin wanted to bring a 58 wizard for "mad XP".  That
was my first clue but, hey, I just want to play.  group dissolved
pretty quick.

Had an arcstone group previous to that which was all about mad
killing.  It was great.  Got several quest mobs under my belt and had
fun.

Did 2 LDON's with a 5 person group, mid 50's.  Warrior, berserker
(guess who?), mage, shaman, beastlord.  we owned both missions.  Was a
blast, decent XP, some LDON points (do they even matter anymore?), and
some plat.  Good times.
I know people don;t do LDON's much these days because other content
has much better gear but man they are fun.  I think the DoN system is
better but the content of LDON is more fun.  but when you're a
berserker it's all about Slaughter anyway. sometimes it's about
Collection but you have to slaughter to collect so it's still about
slaughter.  GET SOME!

Had an LDON once where we couldn't get another mission because the
timer had not expired on the first.  Finished the mission in 19
minutes.  Oh what fun!  Warrior, berserker, beastlord, wizard, bard,
shaman.  Never done that before or since.  Sometimes it just all comes
together.

EQ rocks.  WoW blows goats.  EQ2 is pretty good.  Meridian59 rocked.
Vanguard might rock or it might blow goats, only time will tell.

These are just my throughts to get more traffic on this newsgroup
since I love EQ.  I love to talk about it, I love to play it, I love
to talk about playing it.
