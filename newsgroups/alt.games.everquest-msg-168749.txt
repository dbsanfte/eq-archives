Heh no yours is the fuzzyness problem ! I do not support goverment
collecting money at gunpoint and giving(for those of you particularly dense
this does not include purchases of needed product) it to a company in any
instance. Since companies do not pay taxes (only individuals do) , I have no
problem with tax free incentives being given to a company to entice it to
open shop.

Roads are completely paid for by use taxes . Every gallon of gasoline you
buy has a huge tax bite in it. Most of the time this money is so
overcollected that goverments steal it and use it for items other than
roads.

The armed forces I am willing to pay my share of . Not as you seem to think
to open foreign markets but to rather protect my ass. This is one of the 2
constitutionally mandated roles of goverment (provide for the common defense
and secure the rights of the people). The us market is the worlds most
coveted . We do not need our military to open foreign markets ( which may be
unethical as well so not really recommended), the threat of them not being
allowed to sell here is plenty.
