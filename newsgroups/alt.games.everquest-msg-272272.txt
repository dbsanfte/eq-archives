The point is, such a benefit is not immediately tangible.  Let's say you get 
a society request to make 10 threadbare pantaloons.  When you turn in that 
quest, your reward is 9 silver.  Unless you make all the components for that 
order on your own (tedious at the least) it costs MORE to fill the order 
than you obtain as a reward.   You get more than that by turning in 15 iron 
for 12 silver and all the mining takes is time.

Add to this the problem that the society quests to make items generally 
request items that are in fact low enough in level relative to your skill 
that any experience gain you receive from making the items is minimal at 
best.  Every order I've had so far has been for items that were green to me. 
In fact, the new tradeskill city writs that went in this week were even 
worse, giving me a request to make items that are grey to me.  So there will 
be no experience gain from filling the request.  (Though, admittedly the 
personal status points of a writ can be turned into a tangible asset, it 
would be preferable to be able to gain some tradeskill experience while 
fulfilling the reqeust).  But if that happens on a regular tradeskill 
society quest?  Most people, including myself by now, will simply say it 
isn't worth the bother.  If any society levels, it will be the general 
beginner's society simply because the tangible reward is higher versus the 
cost to produce the requested items.
