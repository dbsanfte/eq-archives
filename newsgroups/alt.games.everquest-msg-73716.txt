been awhile since I played my enchanter, but I thought that pressing F8 a
few times does cycle thru mobs. If you've got several critters near you that
you could fight, you could conceivably hit F8 several times to see which
ones are close to you that are NPC's.  I could be wrong though, been awhile
since I played my enchanter or needed to do this beyond just targeting with
mouse.

Also guess I recently played DAOC and haven't really completely gotten back
into EQ, so might be confusing the two.  ROFL

Guess this is one of the things will have to test today.
