Happened about a month or two ago. A dragon NPC controlled by a gm
appeared in WC looking for adventurers. The crowd got so bad that when
the GM told the players to back up, they wouldn't. So he ported out of
the zone into Kithkor, called a few interested players that were in WC
to come there and locked the zone so you couldn't zone in. Lot's of
whining in WC that day. :-)
