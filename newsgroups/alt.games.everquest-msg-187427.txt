All problems of this tytpe can usually be solved by a quick visit to 
www.microsoft.com/technet. You will be able to find out how to disable 
popups and such annoyances as Messenger in the registry. The registry is 
not a scary place so go take a look at Technet and see what it turns up.

If you cant find anything relating to the specific pop up in question then 
head to Google and put in some key words and see what it returns.
