Try, just for a moment, to put it in perspective and realize that I'm
not actually the owner of a money tree in my back yard, or the holder of
a wining lottery ticket. When I go out to buy something, I tend to be
willing to spend the extra buck and buy something of *good* quality that
is rated highly and will last a long time rather than some bargain brand
piece of shit. But I can't go on to then spend Bill Gates type cash
flushing into it for continual problems. The IBM intellistation was
allegedly one of the performance machines suitable for home *business*
uses, and could even double as a small server. Seemed like a pretty
powerful box to me. People at work still tell me how impressive it is.
The mobo can take over a gig of RAM (though I'd have to mortgage my
house for that particular upgrade, I'm sure.) But man, we're talking
about a fucking video card here. All I want is a better video card.
Everyone makes them. I could probably frisk five bums in Times Square
and get a couple of TNT2's. I'm just asking if anyone knows if there's a
way around this "connector" on the wrong side of the card issue. The
*OLD CARD" is *NOT* some fucking proprietary IBM fucking video card.
It's a Matrox Millenium 16 MB card. I see them for sale on line cheaply.
I'm just too stupid to know why I ordered a card with the adapter on the
wrong side. That's all. So, yes. I'd be waaaaaaay better off if I had
unlimited money to just go throw this box in the trash and go "Build My
Own Gaming Machine". But I've already flushed over a grand into this,
and I'd like to put a new video card in. I'm just asking for some
guidance again for a hardware newbie on doing this. I'm even saying
please. Ok? The box had IBM proprietary memory in it when I got it and I
didn't know. Ok... my bad. I paid the price. But the video card is not.
It's a matrox millenium. And my new Geforce 2 MX 400 doesn't look like
it fits and I'm too stupid to understand that and could use a hand.
That's really all I'm asking.
