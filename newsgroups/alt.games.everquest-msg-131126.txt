May I see some actual numbers, please?  I would posit, and this is just a 
hare-brained theory, of course, that it's a lot easier to cary out a 
successful bombing without tanks parked on your doorstep.  Tanks can be 
very intimidating.  As it happens, I do speak from personal experience on 
that.  I was getting out of a cab in Athens airport in 1986, and pulled 
out the souvenir sword I'd picked up somewhere, comemorating Greece's 
independence from the Turks in 18-whatever.  Turned around and there, 
about 10 yards from me, was the barrel of a tank, and a soldier in the 
hatch with an uzi in his lap.  "Yeep!" thought I, as I quickly stuck the 
sword back in the cab.  (The sword was too long to fit in my luggage.  We 
eventually checked it, wrapped in duct tape and socks.  And of course when 
I got back to San Francisco, the hilt was cracked.  Sigh.)

But I digress.  The point is, you present this argument as if to say that 
the Palestinians try harder to blow stuff up when there aren't tanks 
there.  It seems to me, that they could be trying less hard, and being 
more successful.

}Yeah, Palestine's going to have to swallow their anger.  Isreal does that

People in this thread keep talking about 'Palestine' and 'Israel' as if 
they are somehow individuals, capable of coming to one decision that will 
rule for the entire corpus.  Now personally, I've had a hard time getting 
50 people in one room to agree on a single course of action.  Palestine 
has a few million people there.  Even if 99.99% of them believe the 
bombing should be stopped, or even postponed until next thursday when the 
tanks roll back in, that's still a lot of people with C4 strapped to their 
chest.

}The facts remain.  Tanks roll into Palestine, bombings drop off.  Tanks roll

}what Isreal needs to do for their own protection.

Is rolling tanks in the only security measure Israel has tried?  What 
about tightening the borders in some way to keep bombers out?

}No one's asking Plaestine not to be upset about the past.  None the less, we
}don't all get to act on our aggressions and not suffer the consequences.
}Palestine has sank their own hopes for peace.

It only takes 0.000001% of the people actingon their agressions to create 
the problem.

What, you don't think they have a right to sue for half the house and 
custody of the puppy?
