Yeah, I have a similar concern in my IBM Intellistation. There are only
two RAM slots. The inner one is placed such that the RAM stick is only a
tiny fraction of an inch from the processor's heat sink. Not touching,
but you'd be hard pressed to get more than three sheets of paper between
them. The original configuration was that there was a dummy
"placeholder" card in that slot, and a 128 MB stick in the outside slot
well away from the heat sink. (So much for the "Your memory can ONLY be
installed in equal pairs or the machine will blow up and destroy the
world." /rude IBM bastards again.) 
  Now I'm hoping that my new 256 MB RAM stick on the inside slot won't
be affected by and temperature issues or other concerns arising from
being so close to the damned heat sink. So far so good, but who knows
over the course of time?
