I wonder if maybe there are some Pacific people who have been playing
all night and still haven't gone to bed at 4 am?

Plus it's like what can the blue and red names even do about the
servers going down anyway?  It seems pretty pointless to bitch at them
(unless somebody wants to get kicked out of the chat room maybe).

And I just think it's silly to get bent out of shape about the servers
being down in the first place.  If the servers happen to be down and
are going to be down for a while, I just do something else (but then
again, I don't play very much, and maybe it IS a drag for somebody who
was going to do some big raid with their guild or to get their epic or
something, but I'm nowhere near that level).
