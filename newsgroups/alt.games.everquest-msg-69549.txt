    They are. My bad, it's actually on the upper floors of the caster's
guild in Katta Castellum, which is a pretty out-of-the-way place for the
necro to just "pop up and get them". And it's the spells from 16 to 44 only,
not the level 49 spells.

    You mean, other than to get the 49 spells? Well, some oddly named runes
are dropping in Luclin. My theory is they're research components for
spells - a reason to cap research. But my theories have been totally off
before. 8)
