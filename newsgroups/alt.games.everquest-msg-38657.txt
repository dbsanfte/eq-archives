How is that relevant? You have to hunt bats anyway and as anyone who
was here on release knows money was far tighter. His point was money
is now not nearly so tight nor is the economy. Anyone can get twinked
fairly easily far far above what was possible at release. No one says
you have to farm bone chips or bat wings, none of my characters did,
but it is an option something that was not possible back in the olden
days. The more options you have the easier the game is. Period.

Fun is subjective and has nothing to do with the discussion.  The game
is the way it is, if you think killing stuff over and over is boring
then EQ isn't for you because that's what you do at all levels.  The
argument presented was that nothing had been done to make the game
easier for true newbies, which is patently false since the no item
decay economy has by itself softened the blow of true newbiehood.

What is your friggan point? banging on mobs is what the game is all
about, if you don' like it don' play.  Where did a discussion of how a
loot rule affect the playerbase turn into a discussion of the fun
factor? Oh yeah when you threw that red herring out.

And what is stopping you? Go do it if you want. Ok ignore the fact
that most of the quests in the game are designed to provide loot you
would throw away at the  level you can complete them by yourself. Not
all are but a lot are.  So what is stopping you from getting that
quest done? The play nice rules already cover a high level farming a
quest item so there's no problem there. Just petition someone who is
stopping you from completing the quest. Tell them first and chances
are they will back off entirely.  

So what benefit does this rule get you? None, zip zero. Nothing that
wasn't already in place by use of the Play nice policy. So what does
this rule do? It screws over  people who have done the only thing the
game gives them to do, ie Level.  It introduces benefits to lower
levels that they have no hope of getting.  Hey if they are going to
put maximum levels in for items I think they should put MINIMUM levels
in too and suddenly 90% of the twinked lower level characters out
there would find out how hard the game USED to be.
