That must be why the rarest drops for the Ranger and Druid SFG newbie
gear are identical, so that Rangers will go solo and track and kill
every Giant Field Rat they see, er, um, wait, what was your point?

Um.... interesting theory.  My theory is that EQ quest design bears
a close relation to the infinite monkeys theorem.  A few of the quests
I've learned about (and a whole two that I've actually completed) are
fun and/or interesting.  The vast, huge, really really really large
and totally overwhelming majority of EQ quests are neither fun nor
interesting.  And then there's the detail that most of them are not
particularly rewarding at a level where you can actually complete them.
