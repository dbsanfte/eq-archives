OK,  I'm crazy, and from the *old school*.  Why not play your cleric?  I
started doing LDONs with my cleric around 25.  If one wasn't available we
played in Marus Seru or Netherbian.   These zones are easy to get to, and you
are actually learning how to *be* a cleric.
(If you are PL a cleric purely for rezzes ignore me.  If you want to be a
viable part of a group, you need to be good at your class.  Absolutely nothing
pisses me off more than someone who is level 50 and doesn't know how to *time a
heal* or *assist / pacify* or who to heal first or which heal to use.  You
can't power level *real experience*, and as a cleric you can't fake your way
through.  Your dead friends will know it right away).
In most groups a shitty cleric is worse than no cleric at all, and I guarantee
you, that is a fact.
