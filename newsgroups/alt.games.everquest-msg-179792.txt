Actually, Paineel was around long before the Hole went live. Jumping
in the pit warped you out to Toxx instead of dropping you to the
middle of The Hole for 10k... Besides, these aren't 2 different
*races*. They're the same race on opposing factions. And only around
the cleric/paladin guilds were the Heretics KoS. Much the same for
Human Necros/SKs...

Point is, the GATE GUARDS didn't aggro Heretics...
