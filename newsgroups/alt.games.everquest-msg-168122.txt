Hey Seefar! Come join my guild, the Mercenaries of Misery. Most of us are
plus 50 (except me of course, at 46) and the raids for our uber Shaman on
CoM haven't been successful so far but we are a lot of fun. Drinals guilds
are all such pompous, mo-fo's with all sorts of rules and such. We are just
a bunch of people who hang out and have fun. Half the time the guild all
fights together, mostly adults (or at least people who behave like adults),
it is a lot of fun. Send me a tell, or send a tell to Daybreak, who is my
wife's main. (we play on one account until we get a second PC, I HOPE REAL
SOON).
