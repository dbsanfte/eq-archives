Yes, but as the people whining about a US$0.10 a day increase would
point out, it's a 100% increase from plz to please! That doubles the
wear and tear on my keyboard, not to mention that it means I have to
hit "e," the most overused key on my keyboard TWICE, thereby
accelerating the death of my hardware, not to mention the heat-death
of the universe through entropy.

Type "plz." Save a tree.
