At level 59 you will have to kill 100 mobs to get the exp bar to move one
pixel.  Well alright, maybe some exaggeration there.  It might be 200 mobs.

Perhaps you just haven't picked the right character yet.  I've got multiple
50+ characters, but I've abandoned more than one enchanter character at
level 1, having never managed to level even once.
