Just about anywhere, you can get gangs of goblins
anywhere in Droga.

You might want to try the "dining" area, where
the Shroud of Nature drops.  It's wide open, has
good visibility, many spawns, and drops reasonable
loot.  It's also not terribly far in, which makes
getting in and out easy compared to the deeper
parts of Droga.

If you're up to the toughest mobs in the dungeon,
go all the way to the Chief room.  Even better loot,
lots of goblins within pulling distance, and higher-leveled
mobs.
