How about Frost Giants in Eastern Wastes or Great Divide? 

They are blue to my 40 Bard, and lots of them drop Velium Weapons
(good for 5 plat or so to vendors).

Ry'Gorr Orcs are pretty good too- they drop anywhere upto about 6plat
each.

Actually forget everything I said. Vellious is rubbish- Everyone stay
away, you wouldnt like it out there. Its cold and smells funny. Just
leave me alone with my easy loot.
