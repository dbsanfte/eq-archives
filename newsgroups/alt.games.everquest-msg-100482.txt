Actually, Joe.... no. Might have been that way at one time, but at least
for a good while now it's not. Maybe in the early game. People are
identified by a number, true, and it follows you from character to
character, etc. but not account name. Now granted, if you are GM or
above (i.e. San Diego VI employee), it can be easily traced *outside*
the game interface. But by that time it's gone way beyond anything
that's being resolved in some in-game problem resolution.

Naw. The player ID number does that just fine and probably saves more
screen space. *grin*.

Not the case here, but if you remember back a ways, the Sony boards used
to show all your posts in their forums by login name. (Before somebody
apparently realized how stupid that was and how prone it could be to
hacker info central... he he). I saw one there, answered by one of the
developers, where the username was something like Eror401LDAgain.  The
developer stuck in a smiley and a laugh and said something like, "Nice
handle". But I couldn't help but wonder if that person was suddenly on
the "pay no mind if you just lost your epic" list.
