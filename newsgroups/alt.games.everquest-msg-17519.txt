The post 50 fire pets seem to do a fair lick of damage. Most of their spells
wont be all-or-nothing resists (very few wizard spells are) but if the pet
is 45th level it will get a fair few resists. Worst problem Ive had with
post-50 fire pets is them casting AoE spells in rooms full of mezzed mobs...
Funnily enough that was the last time I saw one used :)
