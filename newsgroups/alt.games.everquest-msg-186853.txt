You can't spend lies. The economy was booming because people believed
in the future, and in the president. Bush barely squeaked by under
unusual circumstances and immediately began loosing public confidence.
Bush goes to bed every night thanking God 9/11 occurred to scare the
people into supporting him and hopes he can keep the focus off the
economy and his attempts to remove our freedoms long enough to get
re-elected.

The early 2000 failure was the inevitable drop in the hyperinflated
and untested online economy. It alone was easily overcome, had bush
not cut taxes and begun spending out the ying yang all the while.

False or not we had surpluses and prosperity. Seems real enough to me.
The sitting president takes responsibility for both the good and bad
that takes place on his watch. Bush takes the blame for the crappy
economy we have now.

Missile attacks on terrorist camps are both successful at killing them
off and far less costly then a long term very costly unpopular
military build up that allows all the real terrorists to move to
another country long before the attack occurs.

What is the purpose of the question? The plans exist because that's
what the war department created after the civil war does. Plans.
Whether such plans are ever used the "theoretical design phase"

I can develop a nuclear program in 5 minutes, take a soccer ball

Your acting like a nation is actually going to do everything they
promise to do? No they don't. They are just like people and will do
what they can get away with. For example the US is the only remaining
superpower so we are willing to ignore international law and invade
Iraq without UN support. The Soviets built abm stations around moscow
after the SALT talks prohibited them. The US is continuing today to
develop chemical and biological weapons programs, anyone who thinks
otherwise is incredibly naive.

Yes you see people have different views depending on how they grow up
and are taught. The US has (or had) allies among the industrialized
nations but even among them some people hate us. The third world hates
us because of our waste and prosperity. Under Bush every ones opinion
of us has slid farther into the Toilet.

You seem to think ally = puppet. Sorry Allies can disagree with us.
It's one of the ways we show the world we are doing the right thing is
by convincing them. its the way things work in our government why
shouldn't it be so internationally?

A private in the US army kills a french soldier over a gambling debt.
The US invades France. Both are attacks on the nation there is the
little matter of scale. Again a quarter million man 6 month buildup
versus a quick effective cheap Missile strike.

I must have missed when Saddam Hussien attacked the US? When and where
was that? Clinton responded with appropriate force to attacks on US
interests, Bush is a gung ho Cowboy avenging his daddy and trying to
control Oil supplies. And Britain will always be our allies, we have
too many ties, that doesn't mean the PEOPLE of Britain support the
actions of it's government any more then the PEOPLE of the US support
Bush's aggression. Course Bush has already said he will ignore any
peace protests, they don' matter.  Only rich people who do what he
wants matter to Bush.

It's the scale of the actions.  We invaded one country which just
coincidentally was going to deny US oil companies the chance to build
an oil pipeline where they needed too, and are about to invade another
country which has never attacked us directly which also coincidentally
has a relation to Oil. Hmmmmm.

Who cares what their actions are based on, they are a democratically
elected government in Nato and the UN and as such they deserve some
respect and compromise. Keep on throwing out those red herrings
though.

Well lets see we have demonstration and american flag burning in South
Korea, protest marches against unilateral US action all over the world
and the approval rating of the US worldwide has dropped significantly
since Clinton left office. How many canadian cabinet members have
called Clinton an "idiot" publicly? How many times has Nato rebuked
the US? Hmm maybe its because of Bush's style as a president.

Again with the attitude. No wonder you love Bush you're a bully
incapable of understanding we are just one part of the world just like
him. The difference is that France would respect worldwide opinion and
not invade without support whereas the US under Bush the Cowboy thinks
that undermining international law is A'OK!

I guess Bush didn't get chance to get briefed on anything like that

Those tax rates aren't real and you know it. The number of loopholes
available is and was staggering and increases every year. Clinton,
decreased spending to lower the deficit that alone had a confidence

Please. We spent ourselves into a  hole in the 80's and only when we
had a democratic president did we begin to emerge from that hole. The
Democrats are the ones who support social programs that attempt to
help the poor and lower taxes on them it's the republicans that want
to lower taxes on the rich all the time.

The facts speak for themselves in that arena. Increasing employment,
consumer spending, and budget surpluses are hard to argue with. 
The subject is Bush and his policies not the past.

The lower unemployment rate was a result of better economy plus a
limit on time on welfare. It did nothing to solve the underlying
problem that welfare provides more benefits then a full time minimum
wage job does.

Again the sitting president gets the credit and the blame for what
happens during his presidency. I'm surprised you don;t know that
everyone else does.
