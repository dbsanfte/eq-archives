They are much rarer than they are in sebilis. Almost stupid rare . All 3
fungusbeast nameds have a common, an uncommon , and a rare drop. The vest is
the rare drop on one of them. Expect to see a named every 30 minutes or so
doing the quest at top speed and expect to get a rare drop 1 in 10 times
from the nameds.
