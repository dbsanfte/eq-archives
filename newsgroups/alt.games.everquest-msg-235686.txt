ROFL.

I'll concede you that :) ... but at the same time: All these people
who didn't know the answer likely graduated grade 12... fat lot of
good being actually *sent* to school did them over home schooling.

Whats worse?... having an ignorant parent teach the kid? or sending
the kid to a building where the information is at least fairly
accurate (Columbus _didn't_ discover America...) but he comes home
without absorbing anything anyways.

Maybe its the same difference.
