Well, Ed, another piece of advice is to realize that everyone has a pet
peeve.  Some have more than others, of course, but everyone has at least
one.  And when that nerve is struck, even the most passive of lurkers often
tends to speak out.  Training the docks is a peeve.

Would your peeve happen to be "elitist dickheads"?

Feel free to pull a cross section of my posts to this ng and tell me how
elitist I am.  Or am I elitist because I tend to attempt to use complete
sentences (I'm not always successful, but I try) and words longer than three
syllables?

Re-read that bit of your post.  See how quickly you contradict yourself?
Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 are, at best, hypocritical.

Rise up above it, Ed.  You seem like a nice guy.
