Heh - I've noticed that.  However, I hold out hope that they won't
last long: their diatribes against death penalties (even the very
mild ones in beta), not being able to instantly transport to any 
place on Azeroth and how "slow" leveling became in one of the pushes
show that their attention spans won't let them play a game with any
depth for more than 15 minutes.

The way devs deal with these three core issues dramatically influences
how fun the game is (IMO)

WARNING - reading those posts got me thinking during my morning walk
and shower, those thoughts follow :)

Leveling Speed:  I truly believe that, to form the kind of emotional
investment in a character that makes the game immersive and keeps people
playing, it needs to take time to level.  How much time?  Well, that
is the 64K question, and I have an answer that I'm sure will get torn
up (but what the hey, that's what Usenet is for).

The questions (IMO) that devs have to answer are: 1) How long will it
take us to design and produce fresh, innovative, compelling and in
storyline content to take players past the current endgame?  2) What is the
average number of hours per week our projected player base will play, and
what's the standard deviation?

If the answer to 1 is 50 weeks, and the answer to 2 is 30 hr/week, 
5hr/week deviation, then we know that, if we design it so it takes 
1750 hours (average) to get to the end game and experience most of it,
then we can say that less than 2.5% of the player base will have used
up the current content before new content is released, around 15% will
be actively engaged in the endgame content and the rest of the players
will still be looking forward to it.  These are just broad numbers,
but you have to plan for people finishing content, and give the vast
number of them an ever receding goal.

The key is to make journey fun (something EQ fails at in many cases,
so that only social aspect of it provides that enjoyment.)  I personally
think that having many smaller steps (levels) with much smaller power
increases is better than the way EQ works with large steps (5 levels
for a spell rank, long levels 50+) for big power gains.  In fact, I'd
perfer to see leveling speed (past the trivial levels) remain semi-constant
and have relative power per level taper faster as you get higher.  IE -
if time to level went up as O(N), then power goes up as O(ln(N)) - in
broad terms.

This would make casual gamers(*) much happier, as they could have the
satisfaction of accomplishing something in their shorter play session.

(*) I truly believe the true casual gamer is very rare - they are the
people who aren't worried about the destination and just enjoy playing,
with leveling and gear coming as a pleasant by product of having fun.
What most people call casual gamers are just time constrained power gamers:
they want to accomplish X Y and Z, but don't have the time to do it.

Death Penalty:  Well, if death means nothing then there is no adrenaline
rush when you fight long odds.  If death is too much of a penalty, people
go to great lengths to avoid it (boring camps pulling single low blue mobs,
never going anywhere without a rezzer, not jumping in with both feet and
trying something new, only going to established camps).  And, at some point
it seriously detracts from the fun.  For the record, I hate unavoidable
XP loss as a death penalty.  I like CR's - I think they add challenge.  The
option to have either or (such as they're experimenting with now in WoW)
sounds pretty good to me, actually.

Transportation:  Again, there's that range.  If you can walk outside your
hometown, click a book, walk to another book and click it and be half a 
world away the world feels tiny.  If you always have to run for 30-50
minutes to get from one area to another, you tend to find one good area and
stay there.  If you have to sit and wait for a boat, being at the keyboard
the entire time to avoid missing it, then have to sit through the slow
voyage (nice the first time - deadly boring the rest) just to make a 
connection with a shuttle that has to make connection with a ship that
finally takes you to your destination - I think we can agree that there's
something wrong.  There is simply nothing fun about that the 2nd through
umpteenth time.

We play games to have fun.  Challenges are fun, but Tedium != Challenge.
Timesinks are necessary, else we'd just log on to a level 65, max AA
character in EQ and have our choice of any existing gear.  After a few 
minutes of slaughtering mobs because you can, you'd log off and play
another game.  The thing is, we should forget we're engaged in a timesink.
EQ does a piss-poor job of camoflauging the timesinks, and only the social
ties make change that, and sometimes not then (lucid shards anyone?).

A fun journey will keep me for quite a while, friends will lock me in,
continued new content will keep my friends and me there.  After being so
dissappointed in past MMORPG's, I refuse to jump on any bandwagon of
"WOW IS THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD!!!", I also refuse to dismiss
it out of hand, however.


BTW - what's so big about sliced bread?  I like mine in big 'ole HUNKS!

:)
