I love when people make the argument, "That's not how I would have done 
it!" I know that's not what you said MJ, but that is what you're implying.

Well, you didn't do it, and someone else did. I'm sure that no matter 
how it would have been listed, there would have been someone saying how 
it really should have been.

So did the people that created NG�s for MCSE, CCNA, CNA, and CNE screw 
up too, or are they just having high hopes that people are brighter than 
you're giving them credit for? They don�t seem to have a flood of 
Misogynist Canadians Seeking Education, Country Cowboys Needing 
Attention, Charlie�s Nasty Angels, or Crusty Nympho Executives. People 
tend to stay on the topic that is already there.

Also, saying, "so hope they enjoy!" means that you won't be going there 
anyways, so does it really matter?

Rather than complaining about how stupid it was for someone to name a NG 
different than you would have, beat them to the punch and make it 
yourself. After all, these are stupid people. How hard could it be?
