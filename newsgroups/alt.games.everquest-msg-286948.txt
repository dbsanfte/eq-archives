I'm going INSANE with the LD-thing, and i really can't seem to lick
it ... the best i can do is peck out "/w all wiz 60" right before i
zone, which seems to ensure i stay connected ... and the substance of
that command should tell you what i was curious about back in the day
- it's an old habit, typing that out... BUT ANYWAY...


When i'm able to log in, i'm having a really good time. I'm 1 yellow
from 75 and so everything is exciting. I have had an easier time
getting spells for 71-75 than for any previous expansion with the
exception of maybe velious (walk into church in thurgadin, go up on
stage, purchase - no faction even required). I love it, really. My
perceptions might be skewed because enchanters are actually respected
in this expansion - we get a PBAE stun, mez, AOE mez, single mez, low-
resist mez, lowbie charm, upgrade charm, a sweet self rune, and shiny
bob is new and imporived (88s! woo!).

What boggles me is the fact that i have no context. I've been gone a
while. I was hoping to catch up with a sketch of how content unfolds
for the expansions. Could someone fill in the blanks? And be harsh
with me, i'm just making this up based on what i could remember from
years ago/discover in the last few weeks.

*OoW*
spend dreadful hours camping signets in the 65+ zones, attend a CoA
raid to get pizza, then farm anguish for +200 gear and completion of
epic 2.0; xp is fair and zones are mostly unrestricted; there are
armor quests available requiring both solo work and 3-group+ drops

*DoN*
LDoN-style "camps" of two kinds: good/evil ... take on missions in
[any/predetermined] order to [something? advance?]; there are like 5
actual zones and the rest are instanced, most with great xp; [armor/
augs/weapons/non-armor slot gear] is purchased with points from
winning instanced missions [?]; raids are just for loot and are all
instanced [?], but only request-able by someone who has [fetched a
toothpick of some sort?]

*DoD*
LDoN/DoN style instanced missions but you play as a monster instead of
yourself, with great xp but no skillups; 2 or 3 actual zones, the rest
are instanced; some instanced group events/tasks/missions are
freestanding and others are part of "progression" within the
expansion; the progression is a series of missions for each "level"
66-70 (why is that?) AND the end result is required to progress into
the raid zones ... OR ... raids are instanced much like in DoN (i know
i've attended a raid where we killed a werewolf boss...shyra? it was
BORING); loot is predetermined by your class-grouping when completing
a progression-level mission arc

*PoR*
OoW-ish unrestricted zones combined with instanced missions available
in a set order; progression is a handful of different series-es
(what's the plural of 'series' anyway?) of missions (this is probably
way off); loot is the same as DoD [?]; (i'm really far off with all
this....)

*TSS*
lots of unrestricted zones off of the drakkin hometown area .... {/
shrug}

*TBS*
handful of actual zones containing many instanced missions, both
freestanding and ones required to progress toward entrance to the raid
zone (which very few have entered/beaten?); armor available LDoN/DoN
style by saving up points for mission wins; xp is very good generally;
separate armor/spells point system available for raiders


....and i'm spent...

Thanks for the clue-ing-in!
