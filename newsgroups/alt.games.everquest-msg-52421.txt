 Does it matter? For Monks, epic haste is song based. In other words it
stacks with "dragon level haste or better" or any other item-based
haste. For non-raid situations where you have have a shisshar giving
gimp then it becomes less useful for haste. However the ac/atk increases
are still nice to have.

 Perhaps. I seldom use fists. However I can use any weapon I want and
still get the stats/effect/haste from my epic. Horse crap? Whatever.
