Yeah... I bought another mount (my third so far... I always ended up 
selling them to buy spells) a few weeks ago when I found myself spending 
more and more time as main healer in groups. Of course, they aren't a 
whole lot of use when solo, but no healer should be without one.

I ended up settling for a "Sand Eroded Shell" for 6k. Of course, the 
next one that came up for sale was going for 2k. /sigh
