High level necros don't have the spell because it did not used to exist.  By
the time it was implemented, they already had the higher level ones, and
generally, only fought with people who would need the higher level ones.

You can buy the coffins in a variety of places.  The Bazaar is often the
most convenient.  I have not checked, but I expect you can buy them in PoK
as well.
