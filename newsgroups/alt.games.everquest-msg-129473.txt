Even then... did HGs last night in Rathe with a friend at 24.  Could 
barely hit some of them.  There are, however, giant skellies which are 
much lower cons (black to me).  Kiting them, however, might get you into 
some nasty trouble with whatever else comes along in that zone.  The 
toughest thing about hunting the giants at level 20 would be finding a 
group willing to take you.  Most have other members too high for you to 
group with.  We had a heck of a time finding low enough tanks last night 
after a couple of ours left.
