   Well, that's good to know.  *Crawls out of the foxhole*  

   Seriously though, I wasn't trying to stir up any big controversy. I've
seen a few threads that suggest that in the mid game it is much harder to
solo in EQII than in EQL, but then, that could just be people being overly
critical of a new title out of a sense of xenophobia or something, I
dunno.  I do know that on the official CoH forums there are people who
complain all the time about how hard it is to solo in that game.  And CoH
is can be soloed very easily compared to EQL (and presumably EQII).  I
don't know that is is possible to build a MMO where people won't complain
about hard it is to solo!

   There certainly seem to be some disagreement in this newsgroup as to
which of the EQ's is easier to solo in.
