Well, if I had an unlimited amount of spell slots, I would have all my 
DoTs memorized, but as things are, even in my heaviest root-dotting days 
I've never carried more than the four biggest ones memorized at any time. 
I always, with no exception, have Ensnare, one Root, Gate, and a Heal 
spell always up, only leaving four slots for DoTs... And most of the 
time I only bother to stack three anyway. The damage from the lesser 
DoTs is negligible compared with the later ones.

Anyway, after tasting the joys of Charm Animal (very late in my career, 
I started around 56), I'm not sure I could go back to the tedium of root-
dotting. Pity they had to nerf charm. :-/
