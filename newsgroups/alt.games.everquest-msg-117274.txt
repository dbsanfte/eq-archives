Depends upon what you want to do. Paladins are great characters . Heck, My
normal level 50+ group has a paladin as main tank. She holds aggro better
than a warrior 3 levels higher than her and takes less damage than the same
warrior. We had a guest cleric when ours was unavailable the other night and
she was nervous abouit not having a warrior. after about an hour she said "I
have never seen anything like this, I'm actually healing less than if there
was a warrior here" (and the paladin never had to use LoH and never cast a
single heal spell the entire time).

If you are instead looking for pure POWER... then yes you might want to look
for a different class. It's hard for paladins to solo, they can't do huge
amounts of damage quickly like the casting classes.

Being a Necro, Wizard or Druid will give you this thrill (I just killed that
monster by myself!) but comes with drawbacks. If something catches you it
generally makes short work of you since you have low AC and HP. Generally
when you group you will still need a Melee class in the group.

Kill wisps instead. Their loot can get you as much as 8pp EACH.

Yes... in fact I'd tell you to go the luclin (if possible) and group at
paludal caverns. They have a serious Bandit problem there and need your
help.
