ok, perhaps i should clarify. i play on 2 totally different machines
and i get weird pauses every 15 seconds on both of them. the machines:

machine 1:
P4 1.5 Ghz
368 megs RDRAM
80 gig HD (ATA100)
win 98SE
SBlive 
Geforce 2 ultra
no DVD, just CD & CD-RW
i turn off norton AV when i play.
DirectX 8.0

Machine 2:
P3 750
512 meg SDRAM
60 gig HD (ATA66)
win98SE
turtle beach montego II sound card
GeForce 256
DVD & CD-RW
i turn off norton AV when i play on this machine also
DirectX 8.0

(all drivers are the newest, but non-beta versions)

both machines connected to an 8 port linksys 10/100 router connected
to my cable modem (all connections ethernet 100Mbps). the pauses are
*definitely* not network oriented. i get the pause even if i connect a
machine directly to the cable modem (i tested it) and i'm lucky enough
to not have many neighbours with cable modem service and still get up
to 8Mbps throughput through the cable network (i'm amazed because from
my conversations with friends on other cable modem networks, their's
are significantly slower than mine. i guess i'm lucky..... for now).

i get the same pauses with both these machines. the only real
consistencies are the directX version and that i use Geforce cards in
the machines, albeit different ones. and norton AV, but i disable it
when i play, so that should not be the problem. and this is a serious
problem, it makes the game unplayable. you think it might be the huge
electromagnets i have mounted above each machine? (just kidding).
i'm stumped. verant/sony has been negatively helpful on this one.
useless tech support.
