Reagan made mistakes. N00b mistakes.  I don't consider him an idiot though.
I don't judge a person by their Party (well, Dems/Reps anyway) affiliations.
Carter was a great guy but a bad leader too.  Bush Sr seems to be a good
guy.  Clinton is a horn-dog and a goofball, but he was also good for the
country in the things I think matter (economy mostly, ecology somewhat.  I
voted for Bush Sr first time, Clinton 2nd).  He's also corrupt, in a "good
ol' boy" Arkansas way.

Dubya's pwned by Big Oil.  Pardons for Enron execs should be expected as
soon as he's voted out of office (in 2004).  Meanwhile, Clinton pardons his
cousin or his wife's brother's son's girlfriend (who, incidentally, he's
slept with).

Gore barely gave more lip-service to ecology (treehugger tag or no, if we
ignore the Earth like these two bozos want to do, the human race will die or
devolve) than Dubya did...and we all know that Dubya is rooting for killing
all that pesky wildlife in Alaska so that the US can have a couple more
years of a substance we should have started weaning ourselves off of decades
ago.
