Having actually played DAoC, I'd say that PvP/RvR sucks.

Most (99.999%) RvR combat works like this:
One or two griefers run over to the closest realm and slaughter the weakest
player(s) they can find, griefers run back home, rinse, repeat.

What I've just described *is* the high end game of DAoC.  As I've said
before, DAoC game play sucks.

Now, are you trying to say you *play(ed)* DAoC, bizbee, or are you just
talking out *your* ass?
