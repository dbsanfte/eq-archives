Then your knowledge of cleric abilities skills spells etc. is not very good.

True for casters who can bind right outside the dungeon. The loss
of mana after a rez is a problem. But not true at all for melees.
In some cases the nearest melee bind point (adventure camp soulbinder)
is a couple of minutes away by foot, especially for lower levels where
people don't have Run 3. When melees go down, being able to rez them 
back in is big.

To be sure, Divine Resurrection, which solves the mana loss problem
albeit only usable every day and a half, has jumped up on my AA wish
list due to LDoN.

>dungeons (they have CH now), 

Sure, druids can keep everyone healed in LDoN. But can they save
their groupmates from death as well as a cleric? No way. Supernal
Remedy, 1.8 sec casting time. Divine Arbitration. Bestow Divine Aura.
Need I go on? THAT is the most important thing in LDoN next to DPS -- 
keeping the party alive -- not simply having enough mana to restore 
the red bars without downtime.

>but they also have HP regeneration spells, damage shields, 

Nice to have, but covered just as well by shamans and magicians
respectively.

>nukes, 

LDoN is heavy on undead mobs, Mistmoore in particular but I found
a fair number in Guk and Miragul too (have not been to the other two).
Who is the better nuker of undead, cleric or druid? That's right,
cleric. Hands down considering the huge negative resist modifier
on the Destroy Undead line -- it's almost guaranteed to hit for 
full damage every time.

>HP buffs, 

*cough* 

>resist buffs 

Not terribly important in my experience so far.

>and more!

Yep, like Harmony, which doesn't work underground. Pacify does.
DoTs? If you're killing stuff slow enough for DoTs to have a big
impact, you're losing.

>This leaves me totally baffled about what clerics do in LDoN?

I don't sit on my ass and med like in PoP. And it's more fun this way!
I yaulp and swing my summoned hammer (compare that to druid melee),
interrupt casters with bashes and stuns, strip damage shields on
mobs, nuke the undead, and keep the rest of the party alive.

>Rezzing in LDoN = BAD. You don't want rez in LDoN period! Do it after the
>adventure!

*bzzzt* See above.

>Clerics are useless in this expansion. However i feel this is very wrong. 

You can feel better, now that you know the Rest of the Story.

>A cleric should be kinda like the "dream healer in dungeons" not a druid!?

And they are.
