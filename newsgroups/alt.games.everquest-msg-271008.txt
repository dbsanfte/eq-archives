Our first try at AD was like that - our guild composition was unlike
any of the ones who posted how-tos.  I actually raised quite a stir
when the RL kept trying to stick to the other guild's script, ignoring
some of the lessons we had learned.  With 8 mages, 2 wizards and 2 
rangers the goal wasn't to resist the AE's, but rather to burn the
sucker down from outside of AE range - since FoT hit reliably and pets
were immune to the AE, it's one encounter where lots of mages made
a huge difference.
