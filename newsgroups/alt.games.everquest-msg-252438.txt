/sigh

Given that Sony asserts the shirt belongs to them, and during all phases 
of the transaction they retain final control of it, and could at any 
time simply delete the shirt with no recourse to either player, I don't 
see how you can state with such absolution that the guy who bought the 
shirt actually owns the shirt. And if he doesn't own the shirt, then why 
is he paying for the shirt?

Bottom line is I agree the scammer did something very dishonest. He 
intentionally led the 'seller' to transfer what limited control over 
some plat that he had to the 'buyer', in exchange for the promise of a 
cash payment.

The transfer was completed but the payment was withheld, ergo there has 
been a fraud.

HOWEVER... what the 'seller' lost was not plat. Sony owns the plat, and 
sony still has the plat. All the seller lost was the limited control 
over that plat that sony granted him. However, he has no 'rights' 
associated with that control, no legal body, and sony itself doesn't 
recognize that the player has any legal rights at all with respect to 
access and control of specific assets.

If we are playing monopoly at a mutual friends house, and I offer you 
20USD for Boardwalk, and you hand over boardwalk, and then I renege on 
my agreement to pay you the 20.00 bucks. I was dishonest yes, 
absolutely. Can you sue me for fraud? MUCH TOUGHER QUESTION.

Technically the boardwalk belongs to the mutual friend the whole time. 
The transaction was for control of it within the context of the game. 
Given that before and after the transaction all real property still is 
possessed by the original owners (the boardwalk still belongs to the 
mutual friend, and the cash is where it started) would a judge hold it 
up in court? Or would he say something along the lines of: you were 
playing a game, the only thing that got moved around was pieces in the 
game, no real property was exchanged... deal with it.
