... it's true. It's fucking true. 

They are totally gutting the pre level ten area to make it about as hard
as a sesame street singalong. The hell levels and splat levels are
getting wiped.

And yes, the spell book is going away. 

Patch after this, I guaran-fucking-tee you, is going to offer EQ for
playstation, and every new box set will come with a huge block of the
type of cheese of your choice. Oh, and you'll all get to start at level
sixty with your epics, so there'll be no more of that tedious and
"traumatic" leveling up process.

Well, I'm running home now to delete my main so I can start a new level
sixty a couple patches from now and not fuck around with those annoying
last five levels. They take WAY too much time and xp, don't you think?
