To be honest, as a necro it won't be easy.  Even with a higher magic
resist, they'll still Tashan you and charm you.  :P  If there was room
to fear/kite 'em, you'd have better luck, but there typically isn't.

Best way to kill eyes are to keep 'em from casting.  Stuns, high
damage, kill-em-as-fast-as-possible methods.

My advice:  get a partner who can chain-stun.  If all they have to do
is stun, while you focus on fast damage, you'll reap the rewards.
