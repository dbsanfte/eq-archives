It doesn't follow my experience with a mid-level Druid either. Root is
resisted much more than snare, in my experience... much more.

I do root/dot by the way. I solo'd from 17 to 24 in the Overthere using just
that method, and I highly recommend it and that zone for young druids.
However, I'd begin by casting snare, get the critter into the loc I wanted
him in and then cast my dot and root him. Invariably you'll have far more
resists on the root part of this, than either snare or your DOT.
