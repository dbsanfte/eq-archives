Well, the metaphorical "shirt" looks great, was really comfortable for over 
six months and gave me more, er, shirt-wearing pleasure than any shirt i've 
worn in years, and i'd love to think I could go back to "wearing" it again. 
Y'know, maybe if I roll up the sleeves or change fabric softener or 
something...

But seriously, I had a shitload of fun in Norrath, but I can't help but 
wonder how people keep it fresh and exciting for themselves- especially 
those people who have levelled up past 40. And you people who've been 
playing EQ for years... i'm pretty impressed.
