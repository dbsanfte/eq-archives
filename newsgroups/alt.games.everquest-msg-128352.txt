No, it does not.

No.

Absolutely.

Why bother?  Your character swinging his weapon is independent of you actually
taking swings at things.    This becomes super obvious at high levels.  I have
item haste, spell haste, triple attack and kick all going off at the same
time.  Up to 6 attacks in under two seconds, repeated every second and a half.
If every one of those hits was represented graphichly by my avatar, I wouild
look like a blender.   Yet my attack graphic still looks the same as it has
since level 30'ish, swinging at the same speed and such.

If you still don't believe me... well, a few easy ways to prove it to
yourself.

1) Log your combat.   Use a 40 delay weapon with no haste.  Your swings will
be timestamped exactly four seconds apart, every time.

2) Group with a few other people.  If your theory was correct, six people
hitting the same mob would reset its delay so often that it would never, ever
hit anybody.
