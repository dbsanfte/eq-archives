At the arena in Freeport, Toala gave me a box and told me to kill Shintl 
Lowbrew and her dark elf courier; then said to put both heads in the box 
and combine them...I killed Shintl, and I have no idea about where to 
find the courier...I waited at the inn all night hoping he would show up 
(since Lady Shae said he keeps bringing her mail), but he never did. 

Any tips?
