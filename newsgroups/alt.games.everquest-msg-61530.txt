I'm not an expert, so I would go with Crucial for the guarantee.

Sod IBM, Id get a new Mobo and memory and swap over the CPU. I don't know US
prices (im in UK) but I can't see that would be more expensive than donating
to the IBM shareholders.

Video cards are very easy to change. I would get a GeForce of some type with
32megs - I keep hearing how cheap they are.

Hmm, I never had any problems with 98 and 256megs. I do know from my Mobo
manual that there is an issue with WinMe and  *over* a gig,
but its easily fixed by altering VCache (no, I don' know what that is).

To me it sounds like your machine has a much better hard-drive. Have you
defragged hers? Is it nearly full? etc etc

Hope this helps, I am sure there are more experienced people than me who
WILL respond here :-)
(The issue with IBM, man, on principle I'd change the mobo)


Good Luck
