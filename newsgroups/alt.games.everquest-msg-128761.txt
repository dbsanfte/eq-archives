examine what i've said more thorougly.  bombings are wrong, but we must not
overlook WHY they are doing it - ISREALI OPPRESSION.
bombing this, bombing that.. the isreali oppression has taken at least 10
times as many lives as the bombings have!

isreal doesn't have to send their people out as bombs.. they have their
U.S.-bought military vehicles to do the damage/killing.
isreal only violates the human rights set forth by the U.N. (proof - see the
amnesty intl. site)
isreal only destroys palestinian buildings, cars, lives, etc. and calls it
"defense".
palestine sends out bombing as result of this - EXAMINE THE MOTIVES.

violating human rights and the U.N.?  killing a thousand+ people and calling
it "defense"... yeah, that's moral...

> In the here and now, Israel holds the moral high ground...  That is a
> fact and there is no disputing it..

how can you ignore the killing/oppression of thousands of palestinians
(proof - see amnesty intl. site again)?!
that is why the palestinians are blowing themselves up!
and you speak of morality?!!!!  to NOT dispute this violation of human
rights would be IMMORAL!

quit the blind, senseless preaching and start some real research and
reasoning.
please inform yourself FIRST, then post again... quit wasting my time as
well as everyone elses.

VISIT THOSE LINKS I'VE POSTED - proof of what i've said can be found there..
