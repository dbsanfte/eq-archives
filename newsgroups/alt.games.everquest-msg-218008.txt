Interestingly enough, there is an explanation for this phrase in the
thread about the origin of woot (which I derailed into a discussion of
the orgins of "The whole nine yards")  Not apropos of much, I grant you,
but interesting to me.
 
>> Reduction of hate is waste

This right here demonstrates just how clueless this guy is - hate
reduction is so incredibly vital for DPS classes, lack of it is
high-end mages biggest complaint.

Goodbye guilds?  Who do you think I go to LDoN with?  You think I
take the chance of grouping with people who could be as completely 
clueless as you've proven yourself to be?

Well, let us know when you intend to seek a guild, and your character's
name so we can warn them just how worthless you are.

Ack, I appeared to have cut one of Jame's comments I intended to reply
to.  As far as total wins go - the guy in the following thread may be right
near the top:

http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=8186

Total wins - 378
Total points - 19507

Looks like he did a few hard, and mostly 65/normal.

He has maxed out his adventure stone and turned it into something else
by talking to Morden Rasp.

Let's say for a moment that this guy and his friends are in elemental
gear and just walk all over normal adventures, and say they average 
30 minutes apiece.  That's still 189 hours in one month.  How many hours
per VT-grade+ are we looking at.  Well, the dagger he made costs 3450
AP to make.  19507 points will get you 5-6 of these items.  Let's say
it's 6, you're still spending 31 hours per item.

The assumptions I made all favor LDoN as the method of gaining this gear.
In addition, only people already in gear obtained in raids are going to
be averaging 30minutes per (this includes forming up the first time of the
day, getting the adventure each time, and inevitable afk's between 
adventures for bio and what have you).  Now, I know it's possible to run
this fast, because James says his buddies have done an assassinate mission
in 19 minutes.

BUT THOSE ARE ELEMENTAL+ GEARED PEOPLE.

Joe Casual is lucky to average an hour an adventure in a PU group - more
likely 1.5-2 (including time for group setup and afk's in between).

Now you're looking at 60-120 hours per item.

60 hours is 4 weeks of me making 3 of our 4 raids per week.  Depending if
my buddy is leading or not (he is VERY effective at keeping the raid moving
quickly) I average 20RPP an hour (there is RPP per hour of the raid and RPP
for killing a named.  The quicker we move, the more names we kill in a
night, the more RPP we get)  I spent 500 RPP on the Orb of the Stormwatcher
which represents 25 hours, or a max of 1250 adventure points.  For that I
can get an item nearly as good in LDoN.

So, assuming I can get in a group that keeps the hammer down in LDoN and I
actually average 1hour per adventure, the time vs. reward is nearly the
same for LDoN vs. BoT tower/ST/SS/NToV raiding.

Since our raids are limited more by target availabilty than my time, and
the fact that there is gear I can get in LDoN that I won't see soon outside
(Pet focus from VT) and gear in a lowly Velious zone like SS that still 
outstrips anything you can build from LDoN (a challenge for Ted, make some-
thing as good as Gauntlets of Dragonslaying for non-plate classes in LDoN.)
I see LDoN as being complementary to raiding, and a help to our guild, not
a threat.
