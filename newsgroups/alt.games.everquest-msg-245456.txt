Hmm.. maybe they couldn't think of a caster class that was
distinguishable enough to create.

Weird on rogues.. i would often go rogue for damage in group.

They have a warm place in my heart.. and I always had them along.. the
more the better. Their sustained dps, especially at the high end,
torches every other class i've used for damage. I've gone as many as 3
elementally equipped rogues in group. The mobs were practically
throwing themselves down before we could get to them due to the hurt.
The nice part about rogues as opposed to wizards/mages is that you
know they won't run low on mana over time.

Well... regardless of the changes, wizards and mages still have you in
their hearts for normal group tanking... anything short of high level
GoD.

We can kill dark blue biles in PoD if that counts... and if you
disregard the downtime.

Aye.. still a viable healer for your easy ldon's.. and i've seen
'great' druids be able to heal hards.

>Necro: Another great soloer - now reduced to mana-factory status in groups.

Maybe in your groups. Sure they've got the mana pump going.. but i
usually look at them for damage and then twitching. And in a pinch..
jfc... necro healing/BL regen could break me even on HP. The number of
roles they can have in a LDoN is just staggering.. and the more necros
the better imo. For all the devastation LDoN did monks for grouping..
it did the flip side for necros and got them a lot of groups. A LOT.

>Lusted after still for slightly-better-than-useless-DPS

A high level necro has very good dps, even while twitching. And if
they crit dot Horror they can do 1K/tick.. and have the best mana
regen in the game so that they can almost never not have mana.

>Shaman: These guys aren't currently stuffed, but they're definitely on the
>way back down. They can solo, they're *lusted* after for groups,

Not my groups. Removing of course GoD from the equation, I would
*ALWAYS* go high level BL over high level shaman if I could get one.
Main reason.. dps and the fact that both the BL pet and the BL could
be used as an add tank in a pinch. Its basically like adding 2 tanks.
Shaman are good when you need a big mob slowed fast... other than
that?

Group wise they've been in the hurt locker from BL's for a while now.

Pretty much :>. And if you have one.. why get a shaman? :>

Nice breakdown.
