While I see your point, there is a fundamental difference between art 
back then and now. Back in the day, art would be comissioned by either 
church or state figures for their own enjoyment, so quality was expected. 
Nowadays, "art" (namely, music) is comissioned by corporations for sale 
to third parties. Therefore, the corporations don't particularly care 
about the quality of the product, only about whether it will sell.

It's always a pleasure to expand someone's horizons.

'Bean and Cheese' burritos. They are cheap and filling.

They are certainly useful to themselves and the corporations they work 
for.
