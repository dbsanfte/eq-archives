How come that logic totally failed in the case of funcom then?  Not
saying there wasn't a bias, but discounting all the views of the
boards because "they get to play for free' is quite simplistic. We got
to play for free in AO and EQ, and UO and WW2OL too and the boards
there weren't as overwhelmingly positive as they are in Camelots case.

Please explain how the assholes can affect my game?  Can they gloat at
me? I wouldn't know since I will have been transported back to my bind
stone. Heck even if I didn't I couldn't hear them anyway. They can't
loot me or steal my stuff. Hmmmm I didn't lose any experience for
getting killed  and I did voluntarily come to the dangerous high end
part of the game. I just don't see the big affect they are having on
me. 


Also DAoC is not exactly the same it is a slight evolution of the same
into a better format.

Yes but Epic weapons are based on levels. An Epic staff for a level 5
player is garbage for a level 20. That doesn' however mean that there
isn' a level 20 equivalent Epic item.  And I'm really sorry but there
is no way it took you 2 hours to run somewhere. I ran from conla in
Hibernia to Ardee in about 20 minutes not counting instakills (I was
level 1 and strayed off the path a bit :-), plus you are discounting
the use of horse to speed travel. And that just like EQ content will
continue to be added.

Yes but there is a limit to the number of quests you can get per
level. Up to about 1/3 exp. After that you are not offered any quests
till you level.

I'm going to assume your talking about this as a problem at level 50
since it is not a problem before then. In that case it's simple. For
the last level simply remove the 1/3 exp max restriction on quests.
You do realize more quests are going to be added all the time JUST
LIKE IN EQ, right? 

Also. You can always take your stuff and enchant it for a fee. This
adds AF to armor and damage to weapons.

What level did you get in beta?
