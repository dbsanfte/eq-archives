That was real good stuff.  I had money on the over as well.  Who would =
have guessed that the Bucs covered that themselves?  Though I feel sad =
for some people who had squares.  Think of all that money flipping on =
those last 2 tds because the Buc defender had an open easy run to the =
endzone.

    I think that was the voice telling you that you could kill yourself.
    So this means there either is no God or that you are not a prophet?
    Weeeeeeeee, let's see you explain your way out of this one.

      The Raiders are going to win on Sunday, I can't guarantee they =
will go over the 4 point line or whatever it is, but they will win, that =
sounds like a better place to "invest" than the stock market if you ask =
me. I don't usually "gamble" but I could use some money so I'm going to =
ask God to make it rain on Sunday in the Silicon Valley so hard that a =
rainbow appears and you will have no doubts anymore.=20

      Here I'm asking God to make it pour down rain on Sunday so the =
Oakland Raiders could win, I heard a calm voice say "ok".
