Strawman.  Would you rather have a mob slowed for a couple minutes or
rooted for a couple seconds?  The "best" spell, or set of spells, is
always situational (as well you know).  I just see more overall value
in the spell effects I mentioned than in root.  I am amused to see
you and Faned getting so excited about me finding a fairly limited
selection of spell effects more valuable than root.  It's not like I
said that root is useless, or even as if I had failed to make it clear
that I was expressing an opinion.
