You might consider Yaulp in that case. Beware I don't play a cleric but
I've noticed that a friend of mine barely sits down at all now. He says
sitting down and watching bores him. So he fights away with his summoned
hammer and yaulp as it has quite nice mana regen.
Though when he desperately needs mana this isn't a viable option.
