I have a few questions about twinking my 'chanter...
First of all, I have about 6-7k to do it...
I was wondering if I should get my int maxed or concentrate on HP, AC (encs
seem to get beat on a LOT) and cha...I've noticed that int isn't hugely
operative in mana, usually only giving you an extra spell or at most two. Also,
some suggestions for cool (and cool looking) gear I can buy in that price
range? Thanks for your help.
