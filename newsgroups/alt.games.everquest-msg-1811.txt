On Prexus, I've been paying a plat per acorn. Personally, I don't
think they're worth even that much, but considering the hassle level
of running around looking for stupid random ground spawn, I'm happy to
pay to not have to do it.

And the newbies seem happy to get a plat just for picking up junk off
the ground.
