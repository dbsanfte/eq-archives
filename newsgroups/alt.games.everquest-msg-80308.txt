Ok, I'm still getting a VM too low error. I know that a few people had
posted something about setting cache size or VM size, but I don't recall
whether they were specific or not. I think that if they had been, I would
have taken their advice... so... can anyone tell me how to set this so that
I stop getting the stupid message?? My system: 1.1 Gh AMD Athlon Processor
with 384 kb On-chip Cache Memory
256mb memory
60 gb hard drive (of which there is about 45 left on c:, where EQ resides)
16mb Nvidia TNT2 M64 PRO Graphics Card
running Win XP.

I'm going to go Monday and get another 256mg, just in case, but I have a
feeling that this won't solve this VM is low error.

Anyone tell me how to fix this???

TIA

Darklet
