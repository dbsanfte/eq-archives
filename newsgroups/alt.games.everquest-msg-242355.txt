"in many instances".

By the way, could we somehow make it slightly less than 80 columns wide?  
(excepting URLs of course) In some newsreaders, notably mine, even being 
exactly 80 columns makes a big mess that only gets worse if even one 
person follows up to part of it.  About 75 columns would be good...

Won't matter for the web version, of course, and if it's a real pain, 
don't worry about it, since it probably only affects me and two other 
people anymore anyway. :)
