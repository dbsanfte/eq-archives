Mph.  Going back up and reading his post in a different light, perhaps 
you're right, I don't have much of one.  It's just the heinous unrealism 
of the example that throws me.

Perhaps if the example were:

<Bob> Yeah, my girlfriend is over here.
<Fred> Mmmm, Pr0n. :)
<Larry> I bought a new dress today.

Would his point have completely vanished?  I'm not sure.  I was reading it 
as Bob's innocent hetero girlfriend can't possibly be controversial, but 
the onanist and the drag queen's pastimes can't be mentioned without it 
being blatant.  And somehow describing it as little and sordid touched a 
nerve.  Nobody's details are little (to them), and generally, they don't 
seem all that sordid (to them) either.

This actually came up for me yesterday.  We were killing umm... some 
dragon or other and I had to go AFK for a couple because the doorbell 
rang.  My ex-gf was on the porch, and she'd lucked into some shoes that 
she was certain I'd like, and would I like to have them?  Would I!  
Knee-high silver lace up boots with a 5 inch heel?  Drool.  And I can 
never find shoes that cool in a size 13... and here they are!  And free!

(Strangely enough, they were free because they were left behind by 
somoeone who was not open about his personal joys with his wife, but hey, 
his loss. :) )

So then I go back to the keyboard, excited about my new shoes, and feeling 
like I should explain why I was AFK for like 5 minutes on a dragon raid.  
Should I tell my guild about the cool new shoes I just got?  Even if I 
don't describe them, mightn't they wonder why I'd be excited about shoes?  
Hmm.  /rs Uhh, it was my ex.  Sorry.  GoD still good?

...

/2 My ex just got me the most fabulous shoes! 
Kella:2 hehe cool. :)

So anyway, yeah, I feel the need to hide things like this sometimes.  I 
don't think that makes them "little" or "sordid" or wrong.  But if someone 
else reacting very negatively to them could cause me great inconvenience 
or annoyance, some degree of discretion is quite practical.  No matter 
if it means they're a dumbass or not, it's just not worth the hassle.  And 
when there are people who I can feel free to "let my hair down" with, so 
to speak, boy am I happy to have them. :)

Hmm.  There's an idea for the original poster though.  Perhaps a chat 
channel would suit his needs more than a guild?
