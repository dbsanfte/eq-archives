Just got finished on the most fastpaced insane ldon ever.
Me (lowly 60 cleric)  Everyone else lvl 65 with heaps of aa's.
Slaughter 57 in EF.
Completed it in 46 min flat.  Had to cast a CH on the main tank after ever
mob, but that was it.
Insanely fast. Insanely good players I was grouped with.
Also won a Forgotten Orb of Delightful Magic or whatever that's called.
Extremely happy although it procs hardly at all compared to my summoned
Cleric Hammer of the Souls that I've been using.  Think I may trade it,
although I LOVE the 12 WIS on it......
What do other cleric's that have one of these done with it?

T.
