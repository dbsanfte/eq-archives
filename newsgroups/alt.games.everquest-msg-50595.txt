*boggle* I love it when those who don't do a thing recommend that others
do a thing. If you actually look up the word, you'll be in for a
disappointment. The definition has no correlation to the actual economic
phenomenon.

No. In point-of-fact, it isn't. Unless of course your definition of
recession is "I can't sell this uber-loot for the same price I bought it
for".

This is day one economic theory. Supply and Demand. When supply exceeds
demand, prices drop. If demand exceeds supply, prices rise.

(Forgive me, I'm an admitted layman, so the phrasing may be off but the
theory is sound...)

A recession is when the number of people who "normally" spend X amount of
discretionary or investment income no longer spend that amount, but spend
less or spend nothing instead. The consequence of this is that the
beneficiaries of such spending reduce their expenditures as well, (by
cutting jobs and their own discretionary spending), reducing the total
number of people that CAN spend X amount of discretionary or investment
income... and snowballing from there. THAT is a recession. When the
economy as a whole gets smaller instead of larger.

Now. Just because you can buy that Uber Loot today for 1000p when last
year it would have cost 5000p doesn't mean that people are spending
less. It means that the Uber Loot is WORTH less. The players are still
spending their money. And their -willingness- to spend is the determining
factor when stating categorically that there's a "recession".

Players have no problem spending their discretionary platinum for the loot
they want. Therefor, there is no recession. QED.

Now, let me guess. You went to a California public school, didn't you?
