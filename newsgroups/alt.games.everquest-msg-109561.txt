Bullshit.  The mob could be level 30, and you would still take damage.

I guess your 55 twink monk is better then my 60 primal monk with 50 AA
levels then, if I get that root/dd/mushroom form on me more then a few times
(and its unresistable) then the fights too close to try and kill it.  Maybe
pre-nerf they were worthwhile exp, but IMO they aren't worth the effort now.

I doubt your monk has anywhere near the HP I do, let alone AC or damage
output, so its interesting you say you can pull and kill shrooms nonstop.

But then when I think about some of the other bullshit you've wrote.. I find
this kinda hard to believe
