I play with a 56k modem but currently the drivers are not working properly
so I can only connect at 28k, and EQ runs fine.  Sometimes there is a little
bit of lag but that is more to do with my ISP (even when browsing it
happens) than the game itself.  But the lag I do get is nothing really, and
doesn't occur often.  But then I have never had more than 56k so I wouldn't
know how it compares.
