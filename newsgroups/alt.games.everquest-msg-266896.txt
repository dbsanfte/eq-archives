Heh i think that is exactly ass backwards. I think we keep trying for the 
perfect theoretical socialist democracy but will eventually realize that 
capitalism (freedom) is the only system that will ever work.

Capitalism is a very simple concept that most people fail to understand. It 
basically boils down to any 2 willing people can trade resources , goods , 
or services without inteference from other parties. Every other system seeks 
to restrict your ability to do so. Oh they cry rivers about why it is 
necessary to restrict your access to freedom, great wailing and gnashing of 
teeth goes on daily, but I have some faith that eventually all those poor 
socialists will realize that the only people they are hurting are 
themselves.
