  Where are you getting this?  Most of the benchmarks I've seen have the
Athlon clock-for-clock outperforming the Pentium IV handily, and the fastest
Athlon (running at 1600 mhz) now does generally outperform the fastest
Pentium IV (running at 2000 mhz).

  I haven't had personal experience running similar systems running with
both processors side by side, but if most hardware review web sites are to
be believed, Athlons do presently have the performance crown, as well as the
price/performance crown (as usual).
