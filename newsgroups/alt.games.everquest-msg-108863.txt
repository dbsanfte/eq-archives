There's a PDF copy of 3rd Edition DM Guide, Player Handbook, and some of the
Monsterous Compendium Appendices available on KaZaA file-share network
(warning... these scanned books are BIG files... Players Handbook is only
11mb, but Dungeon Builders Guide clocked in at over 68mb). There's also a
few real gems of out-of-print adventure modules out there too ;o)

You're not gonna have much luck searching for copyright stuff on the web...
is the copyright holders (for AD+D that's Wizards of the Coast) haven't got
them on a web-site, you're pretty much screwed.
