The two skills that will go up slowest with a druid are divination and melee
combat skills. Neither are used very often and after about level 20 a druid
that tries to depend on melee for killing is simply dead.  There are a
number of mana cheap spells you can use to bring divination up if you want
to max it but for the most part it is not necessary to do so and if the need
does arise you can do it fairly quickly.  The ironic thing with my druid is
that evocation which is the soloing druid's prime specialty tends to run
behind conjugation, but that is a pattern which I suspect will be corrected
as I reach higher levels.
