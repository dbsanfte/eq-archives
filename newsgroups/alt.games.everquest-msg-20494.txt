It's like pornography. It's hard to define, but everybody knows it when
they see it. Your non-argument wouldn't pass muster in any court.

Sorry, but Lokari's argument carries a lot more weight than your "Bill
Gates" scenario. That was pretty bad, frankly.

A person who intentionally attempts to break fiction for the rest of the
players, spoiling their suspension of disbelief is either an idiot or a
complete arsehole. The name does not need to be intimidating or vulgar
to be offensive. "Vacuum Cleaner" is certainly offensive in the context
of a multiplayer fantasy game. It's fine for Quake, but not for EQ.
