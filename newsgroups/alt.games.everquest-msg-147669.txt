My guild has switched factions from COV to Giant faction. I was max Kos to
Tormax, kromrif, and kromzek, I have got my Tormax faction up to dubious as
a result of two guild dain kills, however my Kromrif and kromzek are still
kos.

Where is the best place to get both Kromrif and Kromzek to dubious so I can
do the coldain head quest and the ice paw kobald quest?

I have hunted in Icewell keep but those mobs have a boat load of hitpoints,
and there is a bit of down time even with a 60 war and a 60 druid working
together.
