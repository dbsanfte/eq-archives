Heh you missed a few things . All of the above only have enough mana for so
many nukes . Over 2 minutes all of them can completely empty there mana into
a target . Over 2 minutes or longer the ONLY thing that matters is dammage
to mana ratio. All 4 of the classes have nukes within a very narrow dammage
to mana range. You also missed dementing visions for chanters that drops off
of tormax or aary.

Both sow and snare are easily obtainable. Some races get it for a short
quest but everyone can rely on swollen fungusbeast glands and jboots if they
have to. Incidently I still offer 1k pp for swollen fungus beast glands on
innoruk 6 just isnt enough :) . Ill let you in on a secret though. Social
creatures do not run if they are within sight range of any other of there
creature type. The best way to snare the myconid king for example is to pull
any shroom add.
