So I'm new to EQ and got my Dark Elf Mage up to level 10 and decided
to see the world (on Fennin Ro). I headed down to Commonlands, through
No Ro, Oasis, So Ro and into the Swamplands. Was getting encumbered
and decided to go to a bank in Grobb. Perfect, I thought, since I'd
been worried about being KOS in cities and Trolls seemed to be
friendly to Dark Elves (they're in our Foreign Quarter, for gods
sake). I zone in and see several frogs and spiders guarding the gate.
Strange, but they con indifferent. So I hail them and practically spit
my coke out onto my keyboard as two guards hop out and crush me in a
microsecond. WFT?! Wait a minute, what was that I saw on that website
the other day about a hostile take over of a city?! Swamplands also
had some roving frog guard that hit me for 200 points while I was
medding. Think I'll stick to Nektulos.
