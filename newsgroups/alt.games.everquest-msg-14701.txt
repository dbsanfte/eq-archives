John,
    First of all it is not stupid.  It is a method to keep people from being
encumbered.  To say that working on your inventory weight is stupid it
fooling yourself.  You do it like the rest of us.

    Second, Re: losing money, many of the posts here are wrong (others are
right) you only lose a small amount by buying and selling gems.  IF you are
very anal about that kind of loss, then the first sapphire, fire emerald or
fire opal that you loot from an enemy --free of charge-- has closed that
gap.  So point 2, you can do this and it only be profitable.

    Last (and the real point) is that if you treat gems completely as
currency, you have no loss at all.  Now the other posts are correct, some
folks won't trade in gems and that is their right.  But those who do or
those who are reasonable and have had it explained to them can trade items
for gems and then turn around and trade those gems for more items.  Doing it
that way retains value of the gem and is the point of my thread.
