Right, right, mea culpa.  Thulcandra was the silent planet, not
Perelandra as I was thinking.  I've forgotten what made it silent
though :)

I read a lot of C.S. Lewis when I was in my teens/early twenties and
enjoyed him a great deal, although he can get a bit facile at times.
His autobiography/diary of conversion _Surprised By Joy_ I also liked
a lot.
