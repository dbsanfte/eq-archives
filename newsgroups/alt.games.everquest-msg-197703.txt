Hi,

Could any good wizards coud tell me me whitch skills, tradeskills, research
are important to train, and how to train well ?

Thx a lot.

Here that's my husband's advices to play wizard in one to one confrontation
(me and a mob)

- I root mob
- DoT it (with IceStrike)
- DD it (Shock Of Ice/FireBolt)
- DD
- DD
- DoT
-and so...

If root brck
- Root mob
- DoT
- DD
...and so...when mob is around 20%HP :
...root breack
- DD
- DD
...mob and me are in melee
- Piercing
- Then PB AE (Finger of Fire)

If root brck and can't be able to reroot before mob and me are in melee then
:
- PB AE (Figer of Fire) to stun mob a little
- Shadow Step
- Run
- Root
- and so and so....

What are you thinking about it ? is it good steps
for wizard lvl 11 (near 12 :-))

One question more : Why often my spells are interrupted ?
