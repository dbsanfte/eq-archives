Simple enough to prove. Make a google news account. Post to that
account from work. Google logs the originating IP in the headers. That
IP will be in the Sony or Verant IP block if you are telling the
truth.

I say google because few workplaces allow NNTP traffic accross the
routers. Fewer still will not allow HTTP port 80 traffic, which is all
Google needs to work.
(Check my IP and see where I work...)

The gauntlet just landed at your feet. Pick it up?
