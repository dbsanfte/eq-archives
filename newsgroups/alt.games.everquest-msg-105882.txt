Nothing, these guides are based around small loop holes in the trade skills,
you make a character with lots of charisma, start a trade skill, make a
certain item that say costs 1sp to make and sells for 2sp. Lots of clicking
later, you are hundred plat better off and brain dead.
AFAIK most of these little loop holes have been fixed, unlike DAoC (where
you can support yourself by doping a trade) you are not meant to make easy
money with trade skills in EQ.
After 22 you can make 100pp an hour killing the bandits in WK for their
sashes and bronze weapons (after 22 they don't aggro and so you'll have no
problem with them) but this can get boring pretty quick.
