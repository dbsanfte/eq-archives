Already been mentioned, but kill zelniaks and large zelniaks in Dawnshroud.
Loot is rarely anything but meat.  But the exp versus the risk is great.
They aren't aggressive in DS, and they aren't social either.  Watch the
lightcrawlers (a small nuisance that will need rooting).  Also learn ASAP
where the wolves hide -- one is near Sanctus zone -- and watch for the
roamers until you can take them.  They aren't common, though, and you should
easily level there without dying.
