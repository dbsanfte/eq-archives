You are forgetting something.  The moon can only be accessed from Large
Combine Spires.  Druid rings and wizard platforms are simply not powerful
enough for such an event.  Personally I think VI have it good the way it is.
It still offers some convienience to classes that cannot port themselves,
especially those without gate.  Yet it does not take it so far that druid
ports and wizard ports are no longer viable.

To be honest I am sick of people that think they are owed a lightning speed
port to a location every time they need to travel, for the sake of
convenience.  There is a role-playing aspect to this game to you know,
albeit very small.

Next people will be asking for NPC 'SoWers' and Clarity-givers.  Then we'll
no doubt get permanent buffers just before each major raid mob.  I am going
to the extreme, but c'mon, the RL world is auto-matic enough as it is, let's
not make EQ the same.
