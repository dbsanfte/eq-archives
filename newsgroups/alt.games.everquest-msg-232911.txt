There was speculation on  the mage board that the new graphics engine would
not make it to GoD and be released later in the year.  The little bits that
I know of that escaped from beta early is about tons and tons of lag making
the game unplayable in some instances.  I wouldn't be surprised if they have
scrapped the new graphics engine, but, of course, that's speculation on my
part.  Feb 10th is a couple of weeks away - however it's going to work, time
is short.
