I think someone recently posted a much brighter idea. That the dungeons 
for players of a particular hunting ground should be 'close to each 
other'. So if you are 23rd level you'll be in the same generall area as 
other people who are also 23rd level. That it was a bad idea to put 23rd 
level areas 2 hours apart. So that newbies don't have to have 'fast 
transport' to get everywhere.

As you level up... you move farther out, and the distance between zones 
starts gradually increasing, (think concentric rings, which each ring 
being further out, and the bigger the ring the farther it is to the 
furthest point on the same ring, but at higher levels you have more 
options, spells, horses, runspeed, translocator npcs that want 200pp, 
whatever... etc.
