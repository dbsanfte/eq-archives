Back before I realized that PLing was boring as hell I used to PL a guild
mate or two.  Once I came to that inevitable conclusion I told my guildies
that I wouldn't be PLing anymore unless it doesn't inconvenience me.

The guild took that pronouncement alright, of course (it was a guild of
mature people).  That didn't stop the PLing completely...when my tailor
wanted to work on tailoring I took level 10s to EK to kill spiders for me.
Yeaaahhh, it was probably slower than just doing it myself but it was less
boring than doing it myself, plus, of course, I got to know guild mates I
may not have known very well before.
