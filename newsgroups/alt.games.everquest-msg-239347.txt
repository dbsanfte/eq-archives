I dream alot.  Mostly scary dreams where I'm running from something or 
someone thru a factory or some kind of industrial setting.  The worst 
ones I usually don't remember well, thankfully.

I have had an EQ dream.  It was triggered by something that happened in 
game. Way back when I was a newbie, there was a halloween event, you 
know the standard lots of undead all over.  I was no more than 10 or 12 
at the time and on my very first character.  I saw my very first spectre 
that day, scared me out of my wits because he was hanging out in 
everfrost in an area that didn't have any mobs in it normally.  I looked 
around a wall and all of a sudden I saw 3 spectres floating there.  I 
ran like the wind to get away with my heart doing double time out of 
fear.
That night, I dreamt that the spectres were chasing me and a friend of 
mine. We were running up the beach in North Ro towards Oasis and I 
remember being totally terrified because the "zonelines aren't 
working!"  I ran and ran and still didn't hit that zone so I could clear 
agro.  I eventually ran into a building and hid behind some stairs.  As 
if that would actually save me.  I woke up before the spectre caught up 
with us.
The funny thing is part of my dream came true.  In the game EQOA, there 
is no way of easily clearing agro by zoning, there aren't any zones, the 
whole continent is seamless.
