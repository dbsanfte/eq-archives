I know it didn't dump everyone because I got to the server select screen
just after and and there still 500 or so on each server, but I couldn't get
in from there still.  The Everquest site also listed 46,000 players online.
Everlore etc. only listed 1 on each server because Verant has nerfed the
ability of things like EverMon to count server populations.  It is also
nerfing the population count in the server select screen.  What next?
