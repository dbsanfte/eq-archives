Awhile ago I posted a message about 'wankers' specifically in lower guk.
Last night I thought I'd head outdoors again and start on the spectres in
oasis.  Things were going very well, I went in and they weren't being
camped, did an '/ooc I'm fighting spectres sw of their island, just a heads
up' then went on my way.  About 15min into it, some necro comes by with his
pet and has his pet attack one of the spectres I'm kiting... pet dies, necro
dies...

???  I'm still trying to figure out what the guy planned to do.   Not sure
what level the guy was, never bothered to check.

There certainly are strange ones playing this game...
