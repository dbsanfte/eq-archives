Stolen off the druid boards.  "Specific" to a wood elf druid...  which is a
baseline character so not all that specific at all.  =)  Also, this is from
back in the days of the exp penalty, so some of the numbers have been
"smoothed out" around 30, 35, 40, 45, etc.  The grand totals shouldn't be
very far off.
