Yeah, I know, and I admit that that boggles me.  I can understand if
some problems don't turn up in test, because the test servers have a
lot fewer players than the live servers, so even if something is
clearly broken it might be that nobody tries it in test.  But when
problems DO get reported and the bugs are rolled out anyway, that's
just bizarre.
