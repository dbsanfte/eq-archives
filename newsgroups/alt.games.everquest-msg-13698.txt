The rule my Wizard (level 50) follows is that I ask the Cleric.
Taking into account the time to get back after an evac, I think in most
cases you'll lose less XP just dying and getting ressed back in, if
you've got a 49+ Cleric and the Cleric can survive.  Sure, res doesn't
restore all lost XP, but you'll get back to fighting faster, and make it
up long before an evac'ed party could get back to the dungeon and fight
their way in.
