Not sure if there is a hot entrance or not since I never go to that side.
The regular entrance requires fighting through tough mobs on guardian of
veshan faction.

flurry drakes flurry for 800s. They are not real resistant to spells though.

It has been nerfed so many times that it is widely considered to not be

drops per month :p
