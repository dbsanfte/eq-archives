Although I have no problem with people twinking (I do it myself) I do think
verant should start putting some reins on it.
The heavy hitting 2 hders are of no use to a Sub 20 character (not really
much use to a sub 30 one either) but there are some 1 handers out there that
are just far to powerful for a 6th level character, Venomous Axe for
example, I hear that procs at 1st level (around an 80pnt  DD) with good
dam/delay to boot.
Now Verant have made many good 1hs weapons have high level proc (50th
normally) and there is at least one (although the name of it escapes me atm)
that cannot even be equipped until 51.

I don't think Verant can stop twinking...and to be honest I am not sure they
should but I do believe they should make an effort to at least take some of
these "uber" weapons out of the picture.

On the other hand it would be nice if they could drop the proc level of some
of the, now, run of the mill items.
eg Dark Reaver from 30 - 20
