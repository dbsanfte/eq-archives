No I meant it, I was afraid some of my spots would be on your list and
was happy to see none of them hehe.  I know some obscure camps in zones
that already have low populations, but the fact that the camps are in
odd spots makes them rarely visited.  One in particular has never had
another player even pass by while I ran chars through it, and I've run
more than a few through that spot.  Folks stick to what they know and I
guess few know that spot.

I haven't had a need to PL any chars for some time, but just in case I
do have to I have no intention of advertising the locations I use.  The
whole object is to find a place where you can kill lots and not bother
someone or a group playing the game for real, well at least my
objective.   I found the spots I use while exploring over the years and
when the time comes to PL I take the char out there rather than just
trying to PL through the middle of regular players since it surely
lessens their game if I'm wiping out the whole area they are hunting in.
