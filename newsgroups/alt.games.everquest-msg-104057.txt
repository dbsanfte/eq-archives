 Giants. Fight giants of whatever type is appropriate for  your level,
wherever that may be. If you back up until you're just in striking range the
proc won't hit you. You can also step back a few when you see it going off.
A little practice and you'll come to love this weapon...you just need to
know the situations where it is useful. Head on over to
www.monkly-business.com and check out he guides and tactics section of the
message board, I'm pretty sure there's a guide on the adam. bo stick. You
should be reading this site anyway if you want to get the most out of your
monk.
