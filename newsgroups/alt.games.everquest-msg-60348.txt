If there is, I would desperately like to find it. If there's not, it
would take a buttload of work, but it would be a major contribution to
the general body of EQ knowledge out there.

Being that my character slots are pretty much full, I guess the ideal
solution would just be to go to a new server and start creating level
one characters with no factio hits and travel from city to city conning
stuff. Hrmm.....

Long ago I would have thought that impossible, but now that I've run a
level one halfling to the Hole, and a level one gnome to Thurgadin, I
suppose it could be done.
