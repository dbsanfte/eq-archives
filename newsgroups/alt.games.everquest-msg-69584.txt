Basically for all practical purposes vah shir = barbarian as far as
old world faction and possibly better with some factions since vah
shir has no god. I kinda thought this was funny and shows that verant
was being lazy when I got my vah shir shaman ported to surefall and
found that just like my old barbarian shaman I was glower dubious and
apprehensive to some of the druid factions and when I got to halas I
was indiff to all and amiable to the shaman guild.

The god part alters some other factions in areas like freeport, such
as how my barb shamaness was glower dubious with dismal rage in freep
sewer (presumeably due to god tribunal) while when my vah shir got
there (of course they are all godless) it was only apprehensive. It
was also surprisingly indiff to the evil opal darkbriar and only
glower dubious to the dark elf cleric of innoruuk also down there (by
opal) 

So just like the barbarian you can fully enjoy qeynos and halas and
have pretty much the same factions as an agnostic barb.
