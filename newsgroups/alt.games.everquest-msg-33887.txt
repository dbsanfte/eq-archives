If you are an honest untwinked levl 4 rogue, who hasn't developed
some lucrative sideline but is relying on loot for cash, then you
simply can't afford a port.

Ports to anywhere run at least 5pp a seat from dedicated taxi
drivers, ports to hard to get to locations run as much as 50pp
if you can find a taxi driver at all, normally you instead find
people who are willing or bribable and not busy.

Anyone who charges you less is really giving you a free ride
and just charging what you can afford to make you feel
better.

If, however, someone is headed to CS already, and has
slots open, it costs no more mana to port six then it
does two (is there a personal port to CS?  I don't think
so, in which case it costs no more mana than to port -one-

There's a reason why I don't charge for res... its because
noone would really pay what its worth to me, which is
at -least- Kpp.  People offering 100pp are at least sincere,
while the ones giving me 10pp are just insulting me.  On
the other hand, the ones that buff me up before I res em
(hey, the mana is wasted anyway) and then hand me a nice
frothy ale after, well thats what I'm in the cleric game for!
