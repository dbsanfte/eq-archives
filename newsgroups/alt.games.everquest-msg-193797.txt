In my schitzophenia, I am now levelling my Wizard, who is 30. She
would LOVE to kite Rygorr in CC, I cast Bonds, try a root and Nuke
while I run towards the COldain town. If my root lands I nuke it til
it glows. I have three places where I can be far from the MoB, at the
stone hall where it meets the ice, the first bend and the second bend.
Finally, when I get to town, the COldain eat the mob if I dont kill it
by then.

Anyone got a better technique?
