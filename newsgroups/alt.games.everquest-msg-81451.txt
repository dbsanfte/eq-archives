I never knew what soulbinders were until this past week, Most of my girls
can bind themselves, but this seems like a handy tool to have. Someone was
talking about killing soulbinders a few weeks ago (deleted the messages).
That like guard (or any NPC) killing? Glad I don't have to depend on them,
but also glad that Verant added them. I never minded, since I was always
medding, when people came up to me and asked for a bind, and I never
charged, so I'm not losing $$. Just seems like something that needed to be
added.
