Hiya,

Virtually all zones have been changed from the CD versions. I just upgraded
to Windows XP (Clean install) and here's how I did it.

I copied the complete everquest folder to another hard drive. Installed
Windows XP. Installed all EQ CDs that I had without starting the game.
Copied everything from my backup of the EQ folder to the new folder. Clicked
'Yes to all' when it asked if I wanted to replace existing files.

Clicked the shortcut. Started playing. Absolutely no downloads to deal with!

HTH,

Mike W.
