 Well... when you need 6 groups of level 55+ players to go get a piece for your
epic a large guild just can't be beat.
 
 Orrrr... If you want to go to any high level zone or a Plane, a large guild is
the way to go. Pick-up groups to the Planes are nearly always an exercise in 
greed and futilty.
 
 Orrrr... when you die in a realy bad place, a quick call for a high level Necro
(to summon your butt out) and a high level Cleric (to rez you and get your XP
back) sure is nice.
 
 Orrrr... when you need a particular item, there's a good chance somebody has
one to give or sell you at a nice low price.
 
 Orrrr... when you need a quest gem, spell or whatever, it sure is nice to dip
int the guild bank and simply withdraw one (or 3).
 
 Orrrr... just having a large online family that really cares about you is very,
very nice.
