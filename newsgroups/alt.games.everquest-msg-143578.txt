Anyone else see the flaws of the above line of thought?  
If druids were that powerful no one would play anything else. 
If clerics were fun to play there would be 2 in every group and 20 in
every raid.

The only real benefit of this possible change is to...MELEE classes.
No more spoiled bossy clerics (do it my way or I leave) in xp groups,
which happens way too often. No more having good groups disolve
because the druid/shammy cant keep up with the heals past level 40.
Now we can snag (hopefully) one of 3 different classes while still
preferring clerics. Fact is I think shouting LFG for more than 10
minutes frightens some people, get over it.

Doesn't matter anyway really, verant does what it wants with or
without our consent. And from the looks of things is right in doing
so....
