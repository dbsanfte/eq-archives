SK are worse sponges than warriors, and yet do less damage
than rangers, monks, and rogues... substantially less.  They
make a good choice for SA or TA, arguably, because they
can acquire aggro quickly and sponge decently... but the
same is true for paladins, who can also help out mana deficits
in the healers.  In small groups, SK snare and fear have
a role to play, but in large groups and raid sized forces, their
weaker versions of these spell lines are outclassed by "real"
classes, like most hybrid spells.  While SK aren't dung heap
material (like rogues and rangers once were), in a raid they
aren't "desirable", just acceptable to fill out your numbers.

If monks start dying in large numbers while attempting to
pull, then SK might step up to fill the puller role, which
would turn them from "also ran" into "do we have an SK?
Who knows an SK that can come so we can start the
raid?"

I have to artificially put hard carriage returns in, or I get
very annoying line wrap weirdness.  Here, I'll let this line get too long,
and you'll
see what I mean.  Not that I'm above posting in more than
one location, mind you, but this particular post was written
right here in AGE, accept no substitutes.
