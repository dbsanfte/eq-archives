You don't have to go anywhere near the tower boss to click out of some of 
the wings, others you do.  I am thinking Lightning is one where you do, 
maybe Sand too.  It's been quite a while though.  The other issue is that 
you may find other see invis mobs on the way, never tested it.  Of 
course, as a Paladin, you have DA, so you can hit that, run, and click 
out before you are killed, on the tower with the short run, whichever one 
that was.
