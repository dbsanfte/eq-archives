Your point is valid, sometimes it is mneomically more efficient to
communicate with BRT, OTW, or just hit PLZ istead of spelling the whole

We have acronymns in the English language to help communicate, and these EQ
abbreviations (although painful to accept by some) help us all communicate
in a more efficient manner.
