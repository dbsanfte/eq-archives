Lol ... I do that now everytime I help out. With my lvl 53 Shaman,
walking to my cities newbie camps and buffing peopl emakes them
virtually totally invincible (HP buff, chloroplast, alacrity
and all stat buffs). They can survive 10 ordinary mobs on them
at once without any major health loss (wish shamans had a DS :P).
Next thing they do is, however, aggroe a few of the next best
deep reds .... and die. All the buffing wasted. Yes, so now I tend
to educate them before buffing :P
