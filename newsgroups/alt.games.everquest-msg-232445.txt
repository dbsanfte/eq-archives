Awesome!

I too seek that day soon.  Just Dinged 59 last night with my highest
Character (a Druid) and I seem to want to play this one more.  I have
a ton of ALTs between 30 and 50 on several accounts and can't seem to
decide which one I like best.

My biggest problem is that because of my multiple split personalities,
I can't maintain a good Guild relationship and so miss out on the real
GOOD opportunities.

For the mass of us just plodding through life bashing things and
meditating our lives away, CONGRATS!
