Earring of solstice, recommended level of 51

My 42 dark elf cleric wears it. The first number is the number (* )
SHE gets from the stats on it, due ot only being level 42:

AC (4)5

Sta (4)+5 Wis (7)+8 Int (7)+8 HP (45)+55  Etc.
Flowing thought 1.

That is what recommended level is, you can WEAR it before that but you
won't get all the effect. It will degrade level by level until at
level 1 it is only 1 AC, 1 Sta, etc.
HOWEVER, the flowing thought 1 always works.

NOW, if the thing was REQUIRED level of 51 the stats would not degrade
since you'd have to BE 51 to wear it.

That is the difference.
