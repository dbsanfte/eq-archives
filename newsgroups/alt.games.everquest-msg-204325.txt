Wisdom is overrated.  Mana pool in general is overrated.

Focus items are far more important than mana pool items.  Save 10% on your
casting cost and your pool might as well be 10% bigger -and- your mana regen 10%
faster.  Heal an average of 10% more per cast, same deal.  Longer lasting buffs,
same deal, cheaper buffs, same deal.  Heck, depending on the cleric's play
style, longer and cheaper dots, bigger nukes... all better than 5 extra wisdom
and 20 extra mana for your pool.

Then there are the less measurable but still extremely useful extended range
(hey, a focus effect that works on CHeal!) and spell haste items.  Faster spells
mean cutting things closer or being able to do more in a short time.

Less effective than focus items but still better than more mana is Flowing
Thought.  While this doesn't effectively expand your mana pool like a focus
effect, it does regenerate it quicker.  Mana flow is far more important than
depth of pool.

A horse can be a very effective boost to your mana flow in outdoor zones, if you
spend a significant amount of time not meleeing, not moving, but on your feet
this gives you meditation mana regen instead of standing mana regen.  Works
while casting, works while clicking gear, works while you are standing ready to
cast, works while you are standing to avoid aggro...works a -lot- in other
words.  Worth waaaaay more than 8K worth of mana gear (more expensive horses and
Drogmar strike me as a waste of money, though)

Clicky items are another very helpful type of gear; in particular one of the
velious quest pants or drop pants from POG; clicky 110 point group heal.
Doesn't sound like much till you realize thats 660points per click, 3960 hp per
minute... and if you are on horseback, you are getting meditation the whole
time.  Donals Arms are clicky Valor, if you can afford to do without a real HP
buff on your tank thats 220 hp a click, 1320 hp a minute on one target.  Those
can be worth a -lot- more than some wisdom and mana you almost never use.

If there's a wipe, it will almost always happen before you run OOM... at which
point your larger mana pool is all going to waste.  In 65 levels as a cleric I
can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I've said "if only I
had a larger mana pool".  And I was born with a 100 wisdom and have put zero
effort into getting it over 200 (it is over 200 now, around 220 I think... but
only because items that were otherwise upgrades also had wisdom)

AC should be an important strategic concern for clerics, but by and large it
isn't.  Usually you are either too low or high in AC for a hundred points one
way or the other to make any difference in how hard you get hit, sad but true.
