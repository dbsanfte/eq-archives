Butt naked models are a bug with some graphics cards. It seems even
the newbie armors are overlaid a naked body, and some cards seem to be
unable to see anything except the occasional piece of plate armor.

Wolves rock. I look different according to which wolf form spell I
use. (Wolf form/pack wolf form = black with white legs, greater wolf
form = beige brown with white legs, form of the howler = black with
near black legs. And the see through elementaly shaman pets are cute
too. They should upgrade bears next!)

So, I won't see horses if I turn off elementals? OTOH, I guess I have
to have character graphics turned on in the first place in order to
see horses, so...
