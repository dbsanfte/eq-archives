   Well, it's not quite that easy.  On FV, the sense of community is
pretty strong.  Teapray has been very conscious of her reputation.  Oh
sure, the new cleric has a fairly good chance of getting the same same
as the deleted one, but it sometimes glitched where that isn't allowed,
for whatever reason.  Also, I'm _very_ tired of the 1-30 game.  I've
literally played this levels dozens upon dozens of times.  Teapray is my
highest level character ever.  And I am excited about game like I
haven't been in a while.  
   Further down the thread I am asked why I'm tempted to make the
change.  Well, there are good points for each character.

New Dark Elf Cleric Pro's
-------------------------
1) Dark elves are inherently cool looking.
2) That snare necklace.  Very, very (not to mention very) tempting.
3) The roleplay with Lenny would be more standard. 

Old High Elf Cleric Pro's
--------------------------
1) I do like the way she looks.  I have gray hair, pulled back, but not
in a top knot.  There are several white  haired elves running around,
but not so many gray heads.  I don't recall running across anyone that
looks Just Like Her, and I like that.
2) Good Rep.  I've had arguments with others, of course, but I have also
done my best to talk through them and come to a meeting of the minds. 
AFAIK, she's made no true enemies in her travels, and had lots of
friends.
3) Good skill levels.  She's worked hard at keeping her defense and
offense up, as well as both 1 and 2 hand blunt.  She's also close to
being maxed on all spell casting abilities. 
4) Better faction in most cities.  The way I play, I like having full
access to Freeport, as well as Highhold pass.  This has become less
important access to the Luclin Spires; but I would still probably like
to work on these factions.  And this is annoying, though doable.
5) Level 31.  Starting to get into a new part of the game for me, and I
like it.
6) The roleplay with Lenny is unusual.  Some hardcore RP's consider us
to be non- RP's because of our chosen races, but several others
appreciate the coherent back story I've come up with.  Most people that
don't dismiss us out of hand have come to appreciate the Elf and Ogre
with the Cool Love story.

Yeah...  I'm going to be keeping Teapray in her currant incarnation. 
But that Snare necklace is very, very tempting.
