Having recently installed velious ( and now SoL) I am having a small
problem with viewing my windows. I have transparent windows on my
display, which I prefer. The problem arises when I right-click an item
in my inventory. This window pops up transparent as well and, as it
overlays another window, often it makes it very hard to read. Is there
a way of making just this right-click pop-up window opaque.

I think it may have something to do with the /wincolor command but I
can't seem to get it right. All help most appreciated.
