That's the fundamental problem with the nerf.  Maybe Harmony was a mistake,
but the game survived years with it in, and it was an ability people
expected Druids and Rangers to have.

Part of the fun of a game like EQ is playing in a virtual world with
consistant, stable rules.  Changes that don't make sense for in-story
reasons remove some of that fun.
