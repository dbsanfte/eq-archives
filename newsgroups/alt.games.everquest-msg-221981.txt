Actually they drop items pretty well.    I seem to remember averaging about
1 item per 4 Dark Masters, back when we were doing Doomshade.  Usually it
wasn't a good item, but it was an item.

Only if you kill all 4, and get the 4'th dead before the first respawns.
Would have to be a uber group to get that done, considering the amount of
other mobs you also have to deal with to get the masters to a semi-safe
place to kill.

If they are chanting (they don't do it constantly, only once every couple
hours)  then you will spawn Doomshade if they all die, and the spawn will be
lost for 3 days.   If they are not chanting, killing them (even all 4 dead
at once) does nothing.
