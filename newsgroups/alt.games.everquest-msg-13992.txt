Just to add something to this.  If you are in FV and go down that private
Tunnel that the militia employ you will come out on the edge of the ocean. 
Simply follow the shore to the edge of the mountain. Stay as high up on the
ZOne lIne without falling THROUGH the zone. (yes that's a problem here) and run
towards the LOIL zone while staying high up on the wall.  Do this Sowed and
Camoed and you should be absolutely fine. I died 5 times the first time Ir an
to LOIL from FV. Learned this method and haven't had a problem since.
