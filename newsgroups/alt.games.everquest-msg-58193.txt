*shrug* I've been in PoG on about 10 raids, totaling about 60-70 hours on
the plane (some of which I was asleep for, admittedly)...I have 3 pieces of
PoG dropped gear. I am dubious to the dwellers of the plane.

It is possible to help and not get faction hits...I've gotten 1, because I
goofed up. My goal originally was to be in full PoG while still maintaining
non KOS status in the plane, but the guild I was raiding with got tired of
the place and stopped going, and I haven't been back there in quite some
time.
