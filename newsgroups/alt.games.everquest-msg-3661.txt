You have to keep in mind a couple other things that can skew that
number. If you are grouped a lot, you may not get as many kills. I
remember one level getting around 300 grouped exp gains, about 50
solo, and perhaps 200 kills. Being a melee, I get more than my share
of grouped killing blows, smart casters save their mana for mobs that
are swinging back usually. If a dot kills a mob, it won't be reflected
in your kill total either.
