I love your sarcasim.  One of the biggest issues I had with EQ is the "we
figured out the strategy to a mob or zone and now lets grind exp for the
next 6+ hours".  While having a battle plan is a good thing, killing
mountains upon mountains of mobs that respawn at predictable spots and act
in predictable ways ended up ruining the game for me.  Maybe have mobs that
spawn with random abilities.  I remember playing in a D&D campaign one time
where our DM played a hilarious trick on us.  We had been gathering
information on a creature that was killing members of a community.  After
intense invetigative work on our part we concluded that there was a very
young, renagade White Dragon that had set up a lair about 50 miles from town
that was abushing travelers, taking their wealth and killing them.  We
organized our party and set out to slay this beast.  When we finally found
its lair, the thief of our party got an invis from the magic user and went
inside to scout.  Sure enough, he discovered the white dragon inside.  We
readied our plan, everyone had their anti-cold buffs up and we even went
back to get some flamable oils and stuff to dump onto the dragon during the
fight.  Well here is the funny part.  When we launched our attack the fire
based spells and attack that we were doing had NO EFFECT on the Dragon.  It
seems that the young dragon was infact and albino-red dragon.  He totally
owned us.  We were lucky, we had a very inventive DM.

Now lets consider EQ.  Imagine the fun that would be had if one day a Vox
raid was formed to take down the old bitch of a dragon.  But when the attack
was launched it ended up being Naggy with a White Dragon illusion up?  The
possibilites are endless if you only had REAL GAME MASTERS running the show.
