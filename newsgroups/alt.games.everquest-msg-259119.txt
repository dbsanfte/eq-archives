Not sure if cash is an issue but I have Geforce4 Ti 4200's w/128mb ddr 
in the machines I 3 box with. I have never had a problem with them and 
they perform ( for me anyways ) very well. You can probably get it cheap 
on ebay ( saw some that were under 50 bucks with a day left or so ) or 
some other online store.

good luck !
