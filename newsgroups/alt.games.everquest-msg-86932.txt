Murderize alot of gnolls.  If you need faction with Priests of Life, kill
Putrid Skeletons in SK (same place where Lord Grimrot spawns, so make sure
you get the ok of whoever is inevitably camping him) then turn in bonechips

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
