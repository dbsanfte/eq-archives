Realism? Like not allowing someone to attack a mob from about 4+ times the
distance their dagger (and arm) reaches?  Like although making larger
characters (ogres) stronger and able to take more damage, the smaller ones
(dwarfs, gnomes, halflings) harder to hit (due to size), but kick takes more
damage (and they can more easily dodge as their side effect to taking damage
more).  More like rather than take a 10 HP hit 50% of the time, take a 30 HP
hit 16% of the time (over time still same damage).  Just some other combat
fixes I'd like to see, if they could be implemented in a workable way, or at
least as close to this as workable allows (why should 10 characters be able
to crowd around something, all swinging 2H swords at it?).
