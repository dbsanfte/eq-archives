   Pretty much, yeah.  Some people (like me) think they look good.  Some
do it for roleplaying reasons.  The stats generally are not good,  but
then,  stats can usually be corrected fairly easily with equipment.  The
night vision issue isn't has bad as it used to be, and there are more
than a few light sources that are fairly easy to obtain.  The stats on a
human tend to be pretty balanced, so you don't end up with very low
strength or charisma, say, regardless of what you choose.   Some people
enjoy playing a fairly rare race/class.  How many human necros do YOU
know (my human necro once got mistaken for a high-elf, like that was
somehow more likely)?

  So... No, humans are not the best choice, if you are going by the
numbers.  But humans are acceptable choices for any class they are able
to play, as long as you're not to hung up on the stats.
