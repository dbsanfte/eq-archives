I know this might sound stupid, but try another PCI slot for the sound card.
You might also wipe out all your cards (video/sound/nic/modem, etc.) and
load video, then sound, then all the rest.  Sometimes there are conflicts in
memory addresses.  You might also look at the device manager in safe mode.
Often times there are problems with multiple drivers, and in windows the
device manager will only show you the driver it prefers to use even though
others are cluttering things up.  Safe mode will show you duplicates.  Wipe
them out there.

Good luck,
Sean...
