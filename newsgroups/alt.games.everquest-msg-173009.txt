Everquest Gold has all the expansions up through PoP and the original EQ
(I know because the game store was out of PoP for weeks and kept trying
to sell me that).

Strangely when I installed PoP (not from EQ gold, just from PoP) it
decided to install in a different directory and apperantly installed
origianl EQ as well.  I had a hell of a time figuring that mess out.
