A particular morality is not in my view an all-or-nothing package that
one has to completey accept or utterly deny.  Your, my and even
<shudder> Jerry Falwell's moralities will all have many, many elements
in common.  And it seems to me that a culture's laws are nothing other
than those common elements being legislated.

Murder and stealing are considered immoral, no?  Pretty basically so,
in fact.  

You cannot legislate morality if not everyone agrees that the thing
you're trying to legislate against is immoral (prohibition being the
obvious example here).  Legislate something everyone wants and
believes in, such as apprehension and confinement/execution of
murderers, and it will get enacted quicker than you can say Jack
Daniels.

Well, to be fair you did say that you thought evil was very rare.
Seems to me though that by your definition evil is to all intents and
purposes non-existent.

_Thulcandra_, _Out of the Silent Planet_, and, um, someone help me out
here?

Good reads, if you like science-fiction written by someone with not
much knowledge of science but a vast knowledge of Christian doctrine
and Tolkien (very many references to Tolkien's mythology in the last
novel).
