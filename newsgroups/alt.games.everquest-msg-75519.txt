I haven't tried Velious yet... still worries me a bit.  I may give it a try
once I have enough XP to secure my level.  Or once I get enough cash to run

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
