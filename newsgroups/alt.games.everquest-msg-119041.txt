Mayhaps i'll go try the latest Mozilla, then. Yeah, Netscape threw me off in
the sense that I thought "these people have no clue what they're doing".

To be honest, I'm anti-MS: one of the reasons I'm feeling compelled to get
rid of Outlook. The previous version was fine, and then in true MS fashion
the upgrade ruined the program. Too bad they don't believe in going back. I
would be running Linux but I never could get WINE to work (it would install
and then I couldn't figure out how to use it, let alone get it to run
directX programs) and I'm addicted to my games. As a side note, is anyone a
Linux user and if so have you got it to run Windows games?
