On that much, we agree.  My point, which I admit was poorly made, was that 
usually, your opponent 'attacks an argument' while you 'construct a 
counter-argument'.  Whether it is a good and well-reasoned, or even 
clever, argument is frequently largely a matter of perspective.  I've 
forgotten at this point which argument was in this sub-thread, but the 
reason for my post was that Lokari's argument looked sound, and devoid of 
any of the standard rhetorical tricks.

Well, if you're going to be suffixist about it, I'll respell it as 
cleverity. :)  But right here, you've pointed at a great example of a 
point where our ideas of "good" are not in perfect harmony with each 
other.

Oh yes, it was this one.  I saw John arguing just as much from 'selected 
instances of the use of the words "good" and "evil", and that was 
precisely the basis of Lokari's "attack", precisely the point she was 
trying to constuct a logical argument to support.  As such, I saw her as 
fully participating in the debate you say she wasn't.

}Of course,

Perhaps, but given that we have such widely diverse ideas of what 
constitutes good and evil (taking "we" here to mean the whole of sentient 
beings throughout time and space, 'course it's only humans that we know 
about for as far back as our historical records show...) That the 
existence of a universal concept seems to me, well, rather unlikely.

I will concur that that is somewhat an act of faith, but I would disagree 
that there is absolutely no evidence.

If she disagrees with it, why would she acknowledge it?  And her 
'harmless' fun sure seems to have got some people pretty worked up... 
that's not necessarily very harmless.  It might even suggest that she's 
talking about something of substance, debating a point worth discussing...
