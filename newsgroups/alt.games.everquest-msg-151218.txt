If your have a good pc, PIII 800+ with 512MB and a geforce2 or 3, then try
looking for the Gold Edition.
Thats Original Everquest, with the expansion Kunark, Velious, and Luclin.
You really like the features and
zones on Luclin when you level up. Also when you aquired some money in the
bank for instance you can visit
a nice zone called the Bazaar (the market place).

If not then buy Trilogy...
