Why would you have to sell the game? $10 is not that much money, certainly
for a swiss with stable francs as currency :))

It is a very nice game, and it is worth every penny! The monthly fee is
needed to keep everything running, and to provide service. They have an
enourmous amount of bandwith to pay for, servers to keep up, and keeping
hunderds of thousands of users satisfied. Don't sell, play... you will see
it is worth it.
