cost comparison:

jewelcraft is at 111 on my enchanter.  cheapest way to continue costs
11pp per failure.

fletching is in the 120's on my ranger.  cheapest way to continue costs
1pp per combine.

i say failure on the jewelcraft because i can usually sell the stuff i
make back to the vendors for a very small profit (few gp), unless i
forget to enchant the metal.  so it really only hurts when i fail.  i
say combine on the fletching because making the cheapest arrows possible
they aren't useful for anything except raising fletching skill, and the
vendors don't pay much to buy 'em back.
