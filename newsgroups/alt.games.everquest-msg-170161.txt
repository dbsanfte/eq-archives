Some very good loot, but tricky...with false floors (take a map with
you...and beware rugs!!).  Crowd control your first couple times is a
necessity as you tend to get a few adds every so often.

This is a zone where it should be a requirement of melee to have a gate
potion on them.

Evac takes you back to the center of the zone where those 2 wanderers will
attack you, so if you have to evac (and don't want to leave the zone), start
casting earlier than you normally would, and don't go afk.
