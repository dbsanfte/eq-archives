Considering they throw the EULA up in your face EVERY stinking time you
log on, and force you to click an "I Agree" button before you can even
play the game, I'm not sure how much more conspicuous it could get.
Unless, of course, they just made the button half the size of your
screen and had it say, "I Agree, and especially to that bit about not
transferring the account to anyone else, which I read especially closely
and understand and agree to."
