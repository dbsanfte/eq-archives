Inline comments here.  I think all of the following are affordable within your
budget.  On my server (E'ci) you should be able to get all of the suggestions
for under 300pp.  Your AC will probably go up by about 75.

Banded coif.

A bunch of options: On a budget go for gold topaz earrings (50pp for a pair),
but orc fang or cougar claws aren't that much more expensive.

> Face Reinforced mask AC 4
Fine.  Same AC as banded but lighter.

> Neck Golden Black pearl choker  DEX +7  AGI +7
Lose the prom-queen jewelry.  I'd even rather have banded here than this.  My
ranger still wears an AC7 blackened alloy gorget (runnyeye) at 43.

Bloodstained Mantle is cheap (25ppish), better than banded, and has SvM.

> Chest Fungal Fiend Membrane tunic AC8
Banded.

> Back Banded Cloak AC? (sorry forgot to write it down)
AC7.  This is OK for your level.  A supple black cloak from Runnyeye will
have 1 more AC and lower weight.

> Arms Lupine runed Armband STR +3 AGI +3
See comments about prom-queen jewelry on the neck.  Banded.

> Wrist Silver Onyx Bracelet DEX +2  and Serpentine bracer AC1  DEX +3  AGI +9
Prom-queen - banded would be an upgrade.

> Hands Dark Mail Gautlets AC 10   DEX +5   Mana +50
This is good.  My ranger was wearing these until 40s.

> Finger Cutthroat Insignia ring AC1  DEX +2
More prom-queen stuff.  Jagged Bands (75pp ea last time I bought them, but that
was ages ago) are going to be your best bang for the buck here.  Eventually
move to ac5/hp55 or ac6/hp65 rings when you can afford them (you may end up
still in ac6/hp65 rings at level 60).

> Waist Straw Spun Belt AC 10
This is good.  Not much better on a budget.  It'll last you until you get a
haste belt.

> Legs Tizmark Legs AC 8
OK.  Banded will have slightly higher AC.

> Feet Kobold Hide Boots AC 5   AGI+3  HP +10
This is OK.  Eventually you might want to think Dwarven Work Boots.

> Weapons  Primary Icetooth's Claws Dmg 10, Delay 29
> Off hand Enameled Black Mace Dmg 8, Delay 28
These are fine at your level.  I would recommend after your armor upgrades
saving up for a Centi Shortsword.  They go for about 800pp and will probably
drop to 600 by the time you save up for one.

Once you make your trueshot it will last you for a good bit.

Repeat after me.  AC is king.  AC and to a lesser extent HP items are what will
save your life.
