Your idea of a charm reward for quests is interesting.  Another that might
help would be for quests to give better XP.  I've been playing another game
recently, where the levels go from 1-50 (and you can't lose a level on
death, so no need to XP in 50), and I did about 40% of level 49 by doing
4 or 5 quests.  Two of them involved a *lot* of running around, so actually
took longer than it would have taken to just solo the equivalent XP (but I
was playing the best soloing class in the game...for a "normal" grouping
player, that probably would have not been the case), but it was a nice break
from just killing for XP, and the story was interesting.

Make it so EQ quests give good XP, and make it so many of those that give
good XP are soloable, even by classes that aren't normally considered good
solo classes, and a lot more people would do them.

Another thing that would help would be to spread the epic quests out over
more levels.  In this other game, you start your epic quests at 7, and then
there are more quests in the series at 11, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 43, 45, 48,
and 50.  Each of these gives you a good chunk of XP, and a good item or two
that will last you well past your next step.

I hope they do things like this in EQ2.
