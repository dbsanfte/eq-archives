As a beast, he could of used one of his nukes to interupt, but this is
not as effective as a stun spell.  Also, maybe redirect pet to the
Cleric mob.. the pet procs can often interupt the caster.

I have a hot key for the redirect of pet specificly

/pet back off  (pulls pet off of present mob)
/pet attack     (hopefully redirects pet on new mob before it gets hit
again.)
