I was told the amount of hp's healed was 1/4 your skill rating per bandage.
The higher your skill the more hp's you'd heal.  I didn't start training my
bandage skill till about L30 or so which was about the time I could easily
cover the expense.

Very valuable for any one who wants to solo/farm items to help reduce
downtime for heals.
