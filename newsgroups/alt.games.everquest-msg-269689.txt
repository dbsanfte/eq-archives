The easiest way is to have the main call out the HO before initiating and
having the others in the group hold off specials until the HO is started.
Of course this will take the kind of communication you don't normally see
in pick-up groups. And I tend to agree that they hinder efficiency in a
well balanced group.

I have a faint idea that this was the thinking behind the HO concept.
Something that would allow you to solo so they can say that you can solo,
but made it group friendly as well so it didn't come off as a solo only
maneuver.

There are two ways I would handle it (if I grouped with anyone but my
wife). First, I would do as you alluded to and make the member with the
"best" HO for the situation fire off their solo HO as they saw fit (of
course they'd have to call out when they were going to fire it off a few
seconds before initiating it. Second, I would set the gameplan before hand
in a group HO situation. I would tell them who should initiate it and the
order they were to fire off. There are several problems with this. The
first problem with this is the inevitable person not listening or paying
attention and breaking the chain. The second problem is not having the
right member types to complete a useful chain. Just looking at the list at:
http://www.gnorrath.com/index.htm and you can see the problem. The lists
aren't complete yet. And I pity the scout who isn't paying complete
attention and lets a area effect HO go off after the mezzer has done
his/her magic on the other mobs.

Personally, I wouldn't bother using group HOs - at least until the
population gets assimilated to them and can carry them off as second
nature. I also don't think this will happen quite the way they were
intended. As for me, I'll use the first method I described above and let
one group member do their solo HOs and if feelings start to get hurt rotate
the solo HOs among the groupmembers.

If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else flying forward
into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact.
