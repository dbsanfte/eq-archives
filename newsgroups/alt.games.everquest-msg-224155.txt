well - I had no luck with that, BUT - I died (imagine that!) and when
I was dead I changed breeds.  Got rezzed, re-equipped and BINGO, I HAD
PANTS!  Changed to my normal white/black fur and they stayed.  

I think it was the fact that I unequipped  everything.  (or maybe it
was just one other thing besides the pants)  But, in the future I'll
just do a complete wardrobe change.

This has, btw, caused tremendous hilarity in guild chat.
