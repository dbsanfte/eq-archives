    Logs should be able to show that:

    1) you did in fact communicate with that guildie with your ranger and/or
other chars before and after the transfer
    2) you are in fact in the same guild as that person

    Two things which indicate there may be another motive for the transfer
than you buying the plat off them with money through a third party.
