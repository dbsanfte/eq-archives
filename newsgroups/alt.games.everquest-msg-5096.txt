At level 10 on my first character I was still mostly in patchwork and slowly
replacing it with leather (druid).  It's been about 2 years but I seem to
recall having about 4 pieces of leather.  Losing my corpse at that point
would have been devistating.

And you can't kill wisps without a magic weapon and the only way you can get
a  magic weapon at level 10 (if you're the average newbie) is to beg for a
summoned one if you want to be at ALL honorable, or you can be a sucky real
beggar.   Honestly I wouldn't have done EITHER.  I would have either quit,
killed the character, or did what he did.

Pat, just petition again today.  Make a list of what you lost beforehand.  I
doubt if a GM would have much trouble replacing your duds.
