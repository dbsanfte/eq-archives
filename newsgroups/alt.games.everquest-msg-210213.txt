Major sidetracked topic =p
Anyway, Vindi wasnt a target in response to your "4 cleric" rotation - it
was a bad example really.

The point was tho, if u have 2 clerics on a big hitting mob, of course
nobody else gets heals.  But that is way below comfort factor; if you have
anything near "normal" numbers, then group healing isn't the raid killer
that some portray it to be

The last 2 vindi's I've done was a 1 and half group kill with me as ramp
tank (2 clerics), and a 1 group/1 cleric vindi kill, again with me as ramp
tank... nothing like a 4 cleric mob you think im saying :p
