No, that's NOT their primary goal.  They want all priests to be
able to play the role of healer equally effectively.  There's a
subtle difference in there you seem to miss.

It's not "every priest heals the same" (or every fighter tanks the same
or whatever), it's "every member of a class can fulfill the role of
that class in a group."   They do that in different ways, just like
(in theory) a shaman can heal as well as a cleric in EQ because
he can slow.

Pretty much.   In EQ2 you see "group looking for healer", not
"group looking for cleric."   (Or tank instead of warrior, etc.)
I'm not sure why you think that's a bad thing.   Then again,
in EQ2 you see guilds recruiting or leveling alts for classes
they don't have because they're needed in raid encounters.
Again, I don't think that's a bad thing.

Whatever else they bring to a group, just like any other game.
Druids have group cures other priest classes don't, for instance.
(As do shaman IIRC.)  Against some encounters, that's a
critical role.

Then you're fine with the "holy trinity" of EQ?   A group needs
at least a warrior and cleric, and 4 other people (one of which
*must* be an enchanter if the group is going to be doing more
than single pulls?)   If that's your point (and I don't believe it is),
you're way out of the mainstream.
