What gets me is that I forgot to change the default starting city for my 
new human bard, so I wound up with Crescent Reach. However, when it came 
time to get my adventurer's stone, I spoke with the Wayfarers NPC in 
Freeport and then in the Commonlands and received my stone. Still, I 
contine to get that message, "A mysterious voice whispers in your mind..." 
every time I enter certain zones. I guess I'm gonna have to repeat the 
quest in CR to get rid of it.

Anyone know who I would speak to in CR?
