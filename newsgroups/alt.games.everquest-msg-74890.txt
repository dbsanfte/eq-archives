I do want to upgarde my computer, and yes memory is dirt cheap, but you have
to have money to spend money. I'm a college student, barely able to make
ends meet. I could handle the ten minute load time if Verant would a/ make
the game minimizable so I could check email and such every once in awhile b/
not have to reload everything if i got disconnected (which is retarded, i
don't see why they can't keep the models and such loaded up while you
reconnected)

When I paid for Everquest, I paid for it because i could play it, my system
was well above the requirements. If Verant releases an expansion the new
requirements should only be for those systems running the expansion. Other
than that I think it's great that they upgrade the game, but they should
realize that they have a loyal following and not everyone can afford to
upgrade suddenly.
