You're wrong. Making the whole guild wait around 90 mins to get just 4 
people POJ flagged IS a big waste of time.
The fact that those 4 are 1 step closer to elemental planes isnt going to 
help anyone unless the guild can kill bertox, MM and RZ.
That just isnt going to happen with a few 65's and a bunch of 50 somethings.

Remember, peoples time is a limited resource. Use it wisely.
