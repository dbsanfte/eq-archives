I have a very similar system but have win 98 regular so I already have
a HUGE performance gain over you most likely. XP uses 110 meg of meory
or so just with the default install. In win 98 right now with IE open
and agen newsreader I'm using 71 meg of ram.

I'm on a p2 400, 384 meg of ram, tnt 16 meg agp one, I was using the
latest 23.11 drivers but noticed some slow down with them with
transparent inventory and went back down 2 steps to 12.41 which seem
to work much better for me.

Yeah have mip mapping off.

It does change a lot, though you might not immediately see it. I'd
recommend getting cacheman at 

www.outertech.com 

to see just how much it changes. 
With high textures cacheman showed that EQ wanted to use ALL of a 900
meg limit perm swap file I had at which time I crashed. With medium it
was nearly the same but with LOW eq at worst only uses about 500 meg
of my swap. What does that mean? Well, the more you are swapping the
slower you will be. It means that the memory use of higher that low
textures is considerable while it won't really look much better. 

With low textures and 384 meg of memory and ALL the models enabled I
play quite well. The only other thing I'd recommend you do is bring
clipping ALL the way down as low as it could go and then bring it out
just a couple notches until you can see far enough. In outdoor areas
where clipping does not seem to make a difference, I alway have it all
the way down.

No, there is something REALLY totally fubarred with going back to the
old world textures once you are using the new textures in the old
world. It SAYS you can with the install program on the cd but what
happens is you redo the old textures, you watch the thing put them on,
then when you run everquest.exe the patcher program tells you download
amount will be exceeded and you look and in the error file it wants to
redownload the new textures for EVERY DAMN OLD WORLD ZONE YOU JUST
RETEXTURED.  

Not only that, but if you try to do it LOGICALLY, and just check the
check boxes to redo the old world textures then install.. it for some
reason SCREWS the fact that you installed luclin so you cant select
new models or anything. SO I then went back and had to reinstall
luclin by chekcking that, checked to redo with old textures and STILL
it wanted to patch every old world texture set in the game and told me
download limit exceeded. So I put back in the old world higher qual
textures and forgot about the damn thing. I hardly notice more lag
though now with the steps I took below.

Here are my largest performance gains with a system similar to yours:

1) use a perm swap file, in this case I have one set for 700 meg since
the highest use of my swap file I see in cacheman with everquest is
539 meg. 

2) use the new command in defaults of 
TextureCache=TRUE

That will put about 500 more meg of space on your hard drive as it
unpacks all of the textures, it really kept my frame rare more stable
in game though especially when turning in more detailed areas or when
near other players. It also gets you to char select ONE HELL OF A LOT
faster which is nice, but the first time you run the game after
setting that command it takes a bit to expand the textures on your
hard drive.

3) Set textures to LOW, you lose one ton less memory and especially
less swapping

4) I set dynamic lighting to off, not sure how much it helps

5) Turn cliipping all the way down, clipping is changed with dx8 and
luclin so if you have it at your old setting it will really be causing
you to see much farther out which in turn lags you more. I have it all
the way down and put it up just a notch or 2 to see a couple buildings
in front of me in new areas like shadowhaven.

In old EQ areas like freeport, or especially outside, you seem to see
as far with clipping all the way down as with it out but your frame
rate is definately higher still with it all the way down.

6) consider getting cacheman at www.outertech.com. It does now work
with XP but I'm not sure how much it lets you do. Really for the
system you have you'd be doing far better with general gaming by
having 98 on it instead of xp. In 98 I let cacheman manage swapping
and use its easy wizards to do things like minimize my vcache to have
as much free system memory for running games.

EQ may be making your disc cache quite huge and it won't be helping
your performance at all since its not the kind of application which
benefits from caching recently used filed, that is more the realm of
file servers. So I ran the preset thing for Gaming and cacheman
suggested a disc cache limit of 26 meg, I scaled that back to  13 meg
to have as much free system memory for EQ.

Once for giggles I set the disc cache limit for like 100 meg (and a
minimumof 8 meg in all of these cases) after running EQ I checked in
cacheman and EQ did INDEED cause me to use 100 meg of my memory as a
disc cache. Once again, you are not likely to be using the same files
in EQ over and over again to cache in memory so really you are just
wasting memory that instead could be free for powering the game.

I think XP wants to manage a lot of this stuff for you, which might be
fine with a system with more horsepower but with one like we have I
just don't think so. I'm not considering upgrading to xp myself until
I get my new mb, athalon 1.4 or more, some more sdram to have a total
of 768 meg on the new board and a geforce 2 64 or more. Xp should have
far better driver and game support by that time anyway.. plus I can
get the full home version for like 80 bucks with the hardware
purchases at an outlet place near me.
