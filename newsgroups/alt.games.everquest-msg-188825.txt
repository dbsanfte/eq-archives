Mean like me? ;-) I won't hesitate, however, to chew those out who
either:

a) Ask for warez in the "wrong" places (such as in a newsgroup
dedicated to the warez they're asking for, where there are usually
strong anti-warez sentiments)

b) Try to justify their actions.

Now, I do tend to buy warez that I nab that I like enough to be worth
my money. Does that make it right? Nah. Just a step above the worst.
Still wrong...
