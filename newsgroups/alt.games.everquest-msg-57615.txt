It's one of your abilities.  So the macro would have to include /doability
#, where '#' is the ability you want to use (in this case Feign Death).

Abilities are numbered based on their location in the Ability and Combat
banks.  The Ability bank is numbered 1-6 (left to right, top to bottom) and
the Combat bank 7-10 (ignore Attack and Range Attack).

The hot key may look like this...
/pause 10, /doability 9 (assumes FD in position 9)
/sit
/sit off
/attack

That would give you a one second FD.  I don;t know if it will work.  I don't
play a monk and haven't tried it.  I have worked similar buttons for
casters, though.
