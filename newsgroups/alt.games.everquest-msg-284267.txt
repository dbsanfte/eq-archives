I think the question was not what the regurgitonic is for, but how
anyone ever figured out how to get it.

I've had similar questions now and then, and the answer usually is
that there was some in-game lore that hinted at it (or maybe even
spelled it out clearly), but the source and wording of the hints is
rarely recorded, so it can look quite mysterious when all you see
is the instructions on what you need to do.

I don't know off-hand how the regurgitonic subquest got figured out.
