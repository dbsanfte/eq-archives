In the case of my druid it allows her to safely quad kite more easily,
on a larger number of mobs, and handle adds without abandoning the kill;
all of these directly improve the speed she levels.

Less abandoned kites = less time wasted.
More viable targets = less time searching for 4 easy ones
Safer adds (root, dot, come back later) = less abandoned kites

etc.

Hell, sometimes I even start building a second quad while killing the
first by spacing the adds out a lil, because I have mana for a lil
over 2 "perfect" quads.

Of course, none of this changes the fact that regen and haste benefit
casters too. My druid can melee a blue con to death without losing more
than half a bubble of XP anyway, at level 36, so when shes OOM its
still not a problem. Not like thats confined to meleeists.

For reference she's here:

She currently wears my mains fungi tunic too, for giggles.

Oh, and glancing at that she has a cloak of truth, not a shissir scale
cloak, which includes 8 wis and 5% med bonus, I think.

I didnt spend any noticable time collecting this stuff, and spent maybe
a total of 1k directly on twink gear. A lot of it accrued from kills I
won and didnt want to sell (The SBS, for example), or friends who I'd
given stuff they COULD use coming back to me a few kmonths later and
saying "hey, would your lil druid like this?"

I dont know how unrepresentative a twink neko is, but as I said, I havent
put any great effort into equipping her, and I'm not in one of my servers
top-tier guilds, or considered uber generally...
