Thats an interesting thought, I don't clear out the Friends list often 
either, and yet 90% of the people on it (easily 2 or 3 times as many as 
my ignore list) I have no idea who they are.  Worse, I'm playing on FV 
so very often they are anon.

I've put them there because I grouped with them on more than one 
occaision and found them to be both competant and good company.

Presumably the same will still be true 40 levels later; if someone was 
good enough to merit a friends listing in the havoc that is 
Paladul/Karns/Overthere, he's probably matured into an even more 
competant player and hopefully hasn't become a jerk in the intervening time.

But the whole "what level is he now... and hey, what class was he 
anyway?" thing makes the friends list less useful than I'd like it to 
be, not only do I not have any idea who this person is (in terms of why 
I liked him) but I don't even know what he's capable of... need a healer 
for an LDoN and Underhill is on, do I give him a tell?  Or is he now 20 
levels lower than me and by the way, a monk?

So there are about 7 people I see online every couple days on my friends 
list that I pretty much ignore, unless one happens to be asking for mage 
summoned gear or something like that.

Funny thing is, they tend to remember me even though I haven't a clue 
who they are!

Splendid
