In CoH I switched back and forth but used mostly 3rd person.  In Guild Wars
I always used 3rd person.  In EQ, I *always* use first person.  It's just
built that way.  The engine is more Quake than Diablo.  Get used to that and
you will probably enjoy the game more.

That's the element, the redeeming quality of EQ's slower pacing.  You can
"pull one out".  In CoH or GW, when you lose, you lose.  Pulling one out is
rare, because you either have the right strategy and enough power, or not.

Due to the numbers being thrown around at the highest end raiding, it
actually moves more toward that sort of win-or-lose feel, though the fights
still take a lengthy amount of time.
