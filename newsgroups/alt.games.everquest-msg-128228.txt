No idea, but off the top of my head I'm thinking that if you have Win2k or
WinXP you might be able to disable that service in Services (Control Panel
>> Administrative >> Services).  If you're new to Services it's probably
best you do as LITTLE as possible in there...you don't want to disable the
wrong thing. :)
