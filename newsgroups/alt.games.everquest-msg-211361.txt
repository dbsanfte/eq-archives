I think there's a Luminescent Staff (or something like that) that casts
Lightning Blast, a level 44 447DD PbAoE normally used for quad-kiting.  But
that might damage your tank too.

I 2-box a 61 druid as well, just starting his archetype AAs.  I think the
first to go for would be Spell Casting Mastery I, II and III.  It's highly
recommended on the druid boards.  Went for Run3 and Wis3 in the general AAs.
Run3 is almost mandatory and wis gear costs a *lot* to upgrade at the high
end, so the 6 wis from the AA's is pretty cheap.  May even go for Wis5 at
some point.

As far as spells, if you can afford it, get Mask of the Stalker.  It will
get you an extra 3 mana regen per tick indoors (and 1 extra outdoors over
Form of the Howler).  Also, if your melee character can stand wolf form
(lots hate it, but I don't) be sure to cast it always outdoors as it adds a
lot of ATK, and is long lasting, so you don't have to refresh SoW often.
Doesn't stack with SoE unfortunately though.

I'm doubtful that lower ac will produce higher maximum slays (Slay Undead
for paladins?).  It may produce higher slays in the range that they would
normally occur.  I think slays probably depend only on the player and weapon
stats, such as weapon damage, STR, ATK.
