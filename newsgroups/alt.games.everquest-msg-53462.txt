I would say it depends on WHERE you inspect people.
Good example are banks, especially NFP bank. On a bad day you can easily
inspect a few people just to reach the banker. Same happens if you sit
near the bank and arrange your inventory, you rightclick 1 pixel outside
the backpack (or as i am sure of, sometimes WHEN you click on the
backpack) and youre inspecting somebody. Sometimes it also go into
inspect mode, where i can inspect a person 4-5 times before it will
allow me to do anything else.
Sure, some people dont like it, and i can see how it can seem rude to
those people if they sit in the middle of SRo to be inspected. But not
near banks, or other crowded places. Its almost unaviodable to inspect
someone.

Again, depend on how you do it. A "can someone please help me with a sow
for a CR" i dont mind helping someone who use ooc.
But the "need sow" will i just plain ignore.

And as you say, the worst are people sending you tells about sow/buffs.
If a person is in visible range, i dont mind a sow or a buff or 2, if i
am not busy doing something else.
But the 5-10 persons pr zone i enter that ask for
sow/buffs/ports/pl/money/items are bothersome as hell, and the reason i
was /roleplay for 20 levels. I usually tell them that if they can find
me ill be happy to sow them. Then they ask where i am, and i tell them
that if they cant find me, and have just done a /who DRUID to find me,
why should i bother waiting around for them to come to me.

As for CR, i usually help a lot of people out at EFP gates. But not
uncommon that someone just take his/her equipment off to look
unequipped. Sometimes they even put it on again right after getting sow
so i can see they were lying.
Found a GREAT solution to that problem: Spirit of Scale.
Faster than sow, so people who need for CR will be better off whit that
one.
Goes away if you cast a spell, or start attacking. It dont go away when
you are attacked, so you can still run, which everyone on a CR would do
(with monk as a possible exception).
So if a person lied about it, they get a hell of a surprise the second
they attack something.
