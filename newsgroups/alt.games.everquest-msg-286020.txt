I learned it is getting far too easy for certain types of people to
break the law and take my stuff, and for them to spread the word to any
other miscreant with access to a computer. Is that your point?

You really don't think that it depends entirely on the service? Well,
we've apparently stumbled upon part of the problem, anyway.

I shouldn't have to "get over" anything. The intentions from the very
beginning were for everyone to play the same game with the same means
available to them. Those means most certainly did not (and still do not)
include hacks and exploits.

Yeah, I've heard that cop out before. There is a noble course in any
endeavor that is shared with other people. People like to convince
themselves that their actions affect no one but themselves. That
justifies it in their minds. It doesn't matter how many people tell them
*exactly* how those actions have an adverse affect on their own gameplay
experience. Since the hacker disagrees with the validity of their
claims, they feel the claims are invalid. Whatever. It sure doesn't make
it true. 

If someone cuts in front of you in line and refuses to acknowledge that
there was anything wrong with what they did - maybe they felt that they
should be allowed to do so, as they only had a couple of items compared
to your twenty - is it any less wrong?

Whatever helps you sleep at night, I guess. The fact of the
matter is that the more content that is rendered irrelevant by such
practices, the less reason there is to play the game. It's a pretty
simple concept.
