Just a response to that particular statement, the "dialect", as you
call it, is rarely heard outside the undereducated segments of society
- and often heard in white people. It would be like trying to push the
Hawaiian "Pidgen" accent or the strong southern country accent ("I
ain't gotta learn no better english!") as a dialect rather than bad
grammar, which is what they are.
