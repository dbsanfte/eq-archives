Yes, its an ironic drawback to good play as a dps class - if you are
playing properly in groups you never raise your defense skill.

>good at quadding and dont get hit...

My first druid main had poor defense because of that. The second one
did much more porcupining (the better equipment at this later date
made it much more palatable) and so got well into decent range before
having to stop.

Man that is so true. True all the way to the top. The best guilds are
still composed, IMHO, 25% people who know both what to do and why they
are doing it, 50% people who know what to do but no idea why it works,
and 25% who don't know either but are in classes where mistakes are
hard to make and rarely kill a group or raid.

This ratio gets much much worse as you get into more casual or lower
quality guilds. :-)
