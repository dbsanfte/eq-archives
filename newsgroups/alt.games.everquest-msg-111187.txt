Ummmm I don't mean to argue with you Jazz but I'm not sure sure that
tailoring is the best advice for money making especially being in Gfay.
There are no spiders there, only spiderlings and that is useful only for
padding and padding needs pelts and there are no pelts in Gfay.  I started
tailoring at about his level and I've had a lot of fun with it, but I've not
made any money at it.  By the time you can make money at it, you are usually
high enough level to make money in other ways.  I have been making leather
padding for 20 levels now and just yesterday sold my first stack.  I have
auctioned to sell several times in FP and not recieved a single response.
At least that was my experience on Drinal.

Also getting that skinning knife was a real pain.  I spent days trying to
get one, and finally had to trade a whole stack of leather padding for one
and pay 20pp on top of that.

My first big windfall came when I collected about 6 HQ bear pelts in
Everfrost and sold those to a tailor for 25pp ea.  That started my bankroll
at about 15th level. Getting from Gfay to Everfrost at 9th level would be
tough, but a good move for cash.  There he could follow your tailoring
advice above, however he would probably be better off just collecting the
pelts and selling them.  Lots of tailors show up there because it is one of
the best hunting grounds for pelts and silks.

That would also put him on the right side of the world to start taking out
bandits in West Karana.  Turn in the sashes they drop and get exp. and fine
steel weapons for them.  Sell them for about 3 plat each.  You will need a
group to kill bandits.
