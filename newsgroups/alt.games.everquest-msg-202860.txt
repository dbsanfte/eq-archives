Does the phrase... "You made your bed now sleep in it" Have any
meaning to you at all?

This is the world they created. It is the world they are selling for
$13 a month and it is the world they tout as being the FINEST GAMING
EXPERIENCE AVAILABLE!!!

So why is it unconsionable for their customers to expect things to
work the first time?

Or do you expect to have to take your new car or even your new toaster
back in to the shop so they can work out the bugs AFTER tyou have paid
for it???
