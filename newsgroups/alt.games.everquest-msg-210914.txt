Good question!

The last.


Now, for how to PL.  Malachite is cheap.  Reclaim is cheap (and you should
probably get at least one of the Sol Ro focus items about now anyway).  And
when you poof a pet when a mob is at 5% health, the mob can then be KS'ed
rather easily.  I suggest not /petitioning the PL-ee.  :)

Magicians are just about the best PL'ers around for sheer speed of getting
through the lower levels.
