Hmm, you reccomend quadding mobs that cast, so that they stop
periodically to break up their tight formation and are doing damage to
the quadder even though he's keeping them at the end of the kite
string, plus are the devil's own plaything to pull neatly (which you
have to do to get 4 instead of 6)?

Admittedly they have relatively small HP totals, drop decent enough
loot, and dont' even require snaring at all since they run so slowly
your main difficulty might be accidentally losing them with their
short follow distance.

But I wouldn't think ideal for druid quadding, especially not for
first timers, although I do reccomend them to clerics who want some
undead to solo... oddly in many cases for the same reasons that I
would think they would be poor druid quadder prey:  The short follow
distance makes them easy to split and deal with one at a time (screams
from the newbies in the zone, but really most of them are now in
Paladul), the fact that they keep stopping to cast adds in to their
snare speed running to make it relatively easy for an unsowed cleric
to stay out of contact and keep nuking, and the damage that they do to
a cleric's HP total isn't really all that bad since he's only facing
one at a time and has a lot more to play with generally.
