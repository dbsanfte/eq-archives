Certainly not, but I could probably put up 15 people 7 nights a week.

Fact is, if the production company thought they were losing any tangible
amount of money by my doing just that, they would jump all over it.
Otherwise, they're better off letting the minor infractions go, just
like the recording industry did for so long with dubbed audio cassettes.
It wasn't until it became mainstream to pirate music that they began
exercising their legal rights.

What the heck are you talking about burning?! I'm talking about using
the published works of someone else for your own gain, not destroying
your rightfully purchased copy.

Of course it doesn't. The game was designed to facilitate just that type
of activity.

You would likely be surprised. I can't imagine it's lawful to do what
you're suggesting here. That is akin to setting up shop in the middle of
Blockbuster Video, buying all their stuff and marking it up.

Only if you refuse to accept the basic principles of copyright.
