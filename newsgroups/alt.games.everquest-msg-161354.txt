Wow, there are auctions now? LOL, yep, I knew I was out of the loop! Ok,
I'll keep the Bazaar in Luclin in mind if I wind up deciding to buy a
weapon.

Oooo that sounds like my range, I'll see if I can find it and hook up with a
group there. Hope there are still players of that level there!

Yep, I have all expansions and I've been using the PoK quite a bit to
explore. I've spent most of today looking around Warslik's Woods outside of
Cabilis, I've heard that's another good place for me at my level. I've
killed a few blues but I've yet to see anyone else in the zone to group
with. Guess I'll try to make my way to Paludal Caverns after a bit.

Thanks. No wierdness that I know of yet.

> Did I miss anything?

Yeah, recommendations on a good Piercing weapon for a 21 Shaman to start
preparing for my Epic, or other good items for a Shaman of my level that I
can quest for, hunt for or just buy from the Bazaar. If you think I'm out of
loop on where to buy and sell things, you should have a look at the
equipment this character is wearing! ;-)

Thanks,
