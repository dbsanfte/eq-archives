All of them are based on tradeskills, usually baking... you will sit there
for 24 hours and make the same platinum that a lvl 45 char can get by
running into Crystal Caverns and killing miners for about half hour

One other guide bases itself on the rare spawn cycle in Frontier Mountains
that no one does anymore because no one really wants the items farmed.

There is only one way to make plat and that is to kill kill kill and loot
the corpses.

Do what I do and loot everything pages, gems, anything that is stackable.
and sell them to the vendors - get your cha up to help a little.
