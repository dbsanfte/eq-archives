> The druid nukes arent anywhere near wizards at high level

I agree.  I have a 51 druid and my wife has a 51 wizard.  My big nuke is 
the size of her small nuke.  She has a stack of SoW potions, and doesn't 
need me for anything.  The wizzie has an easier time soloing than I do 
because she can kill light blues with one spell, and an easier time 
getting groups.  On a dragon raid recently her group killed the dragon 
before my group even got into the room.

It's really about what you will have fun with.  But as the player of a 
druid, I'm saying consider the wizard.  Wizards have more limited spell 
selection and are more of a challenge at certain levels, but can be a 
lot of fun.

Two other things to consider:

If you love playing a caster, read up on the enchanter strategies and 
play one until at least level 20ish.  After I played a chanter I never 
wanted to play anything else.

If you like helping people and being useful to a group, try a cleric, 
but realize they are not super important until slightly higher level. 
In the situations where cleric healing is important, a druid can be 
almost useless.  And druids are a dime a dozen.
