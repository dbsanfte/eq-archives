Pining for the fjords, eh?

(Incidentally, I used to take that ferry. The accident happened a few
miles out from my home town, I had a friend who was supposed to be on
the ferry but got off in my home town, and two other friends who were
on its sister ship that came the other direction and tried in vain to
find people in black, stormy water.
And, my main project this year is to design a test to compare
fluorescent signs to find the most visible color. The usage of these
signs includes marking dangerous areas such as the rocks the captain
of this ferry didn't see in the bad weather due to insufficient
marking.)
