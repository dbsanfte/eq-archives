    Running the math, a PoP soloist will see a 20% increase in the amount of
time it takes to get the same XP as before. That is a MAXIMUM - it could be
lower than that. PoP zones will still have ZEMs of 120 OR HIGHER after this
change, assuming that SOE actually meant it when they said that groups would
come out slightly ahead post-change and that they know how to do math. So
PoP zones will still be the best XP in the game, but the gap will be a bit
smaller.
