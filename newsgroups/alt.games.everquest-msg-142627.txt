Quest are Quest there is no change except the length of time it takes to be
done. Some quest can be done solo others require 40 or 50 players to assist.
The main difference between the lower levels and upper levels is all classes
can solo till 25ish Most classes are forced to have partners or be in groups
after that. Groups and Guilds are where you will start making friends and
allies, talking during downtimes. Just interacting with other players that's
where the real hidden beauty of EQ is.
