I recently ported my monk up to Luclin and I am bound in Shadow Haven just
outside Paludal Caverns.  I have been fighting there due to a tip from this
newsgroup that it was great xp, which I have to say it has been, and thank
you.  My question is, there is no Monk Guild in SH and the only ones on the
moon are in Sanctus Seru and Katta Castellum.  Both cities I don't think I'm
high enough level to get to without being Invis or something.  I'm curious
what I should do in this situation.  Will one of the Nexus points drop me
close enough to a monk guild city?  Oh and I'm Iksar.
