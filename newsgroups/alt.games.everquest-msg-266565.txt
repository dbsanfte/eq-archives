It still makes a difference to me.  Although far from the only reason I
wouldn't want to see it... theres a major conflict of interest when the
company that decides what the drop rates on these "rare" items is also the
same company that makes money off people giving up on getting the drop and
purchasing it.

(I see Mark's response to my message as well.  That looks to be a longer
post, so I'll respond to it tomorrow when I'm not quite as tired.)
