Not much. The newbie areas where you can kill that junk is meant to get you
up to at least lvl4, possibly 5. After that you need to go a bit further (EC
for freeport, orchill for GFay, QH for Qeynos, etc) and kill a bit higher
mobs. This starts to cap off at around lvl 12 after which you can normally
start walking to different zones (Orccamps in EC and NRo, later Oasis,  for
freeport, Crushbone for GFay, WK and BB for Qeynos, etc) and start serious
grouping.

When you get up in levels you can check sites for advised zones for you
levels or just ask here, where many experienced players are glad to help out
newbies.

Druids have a sort of good faction with most wildlife. If he casted the sow
on you while you were engaged he would get the same faction hit as you do.
I have never seen a faction hit by wolves or bears and the like, also never
played a druid to verify it, but many druids I've played with claimed there
is a hidden faction involved.
