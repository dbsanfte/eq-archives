The chances of obtaining much useful insight from someone so opposed
to any level of decorum become less as their tendancy for the overuse
of profanity becomes greater. Their opinions begin to carry less
weight as people see their contributions more as attempts for shock
value than informative.

Besides, even if they *do* have something useful to say, I would
rather wait for someone not suffering from diarrhea of the vocal
chords to say it.
