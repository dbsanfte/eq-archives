A suggestion that would not trivialize Raid Encounters would be for Warriors
to get a skill once he is in his low 50s that is a Taunt that has a 90%
success rate and adds some points of Hate instead of just placing the
Warrior 1 point higher than anyone else on a mobs hate list.  Make this a
Skill and not some stupid AA ability.
