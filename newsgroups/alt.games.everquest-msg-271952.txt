I was talking about the paladin subclass quest, which just requires
that the gnolls haven't gone grey yet - there are no solo timberclaw
gnolls, AFAIK (the one Graeme mentioned is a group one, unless I've
missed a solo one in the same place) but those are only needed for a
different quest.

More content for solo players will come in the Big Patch that ought to
come any time now.  Group content was never intended to be soloable
before it went grey.  That's not to say it wouldn't be better if it
was - I certainly appreciated being able to handle low green group
encounters solo, since they are more interesting than most solo
encounters.
