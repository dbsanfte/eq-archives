However, enchanters need research as soon as possible - Mesmerisation,
the level 16 AoE mez, is research only for example.

As to specialising, which I believe enchanters get at 20, just make sure
you put a point in *all* specialisation skills, not just alteration (or
whatever you're going with), or they will all cap at 50. Chain cast a
level 1 spell of your chosen specialisation on a corpse or something to
force it above 50 if one of the others looks like getting there first
and making you a master of evocation or something :)
