There was a time when that was not the case.  A full set of banded armor 
was actually cheap compared to the alternatives.  Back when I first 
started making banded, it was not too hard to find people to buy it.  
That is certainly not the case anymore, has not been for some time due to 
SoE introducing more and more far superior and easily obtainable items.
