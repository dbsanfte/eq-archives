I use "prolly" not out of laziness, but to add character. I don't use it
in-game but will use it newsgroups or chatrooms. It's close to my Rhode
Island accent - which should be typed "problee". I also type "Akchilly"
instead of "actually". If I can think of any other typed ways of indicating
my regional accent, I will use them has the case may be. And if it's the
case that I want to go out of my way to emphasize it, I will grab my Rhode
Island dictionary written by Mark Patinkin of the Journal. With this tool I
can tell the following story:

I was gunna go to d'Wickfit Ott Fe'a yesteuhday and my Shuv-a-lay wouldn't
stot, so I called AAA. Theys towed my cah to the gavvadj. In the waytin
eavia theuh was this girl. I went upta her and said, "Ayyy". And she said,
"Scone'on"? And I annsid, "Nuttin; jeejet"? She annsid, "No, dju"? I said,
"No, jwanna go-va faw a dynamite"? She said, "Shoowa, I know this great
place by d'otch(1) . They use jis the cuhvect amount of hambeuhg in theuh
g'vayvee". So we went to this dina and I asked faw two grindas. The wayta
said, "That will be ten dollis". I then noticed I only had fidolla. So I
haxed the girl if she would mind havin weeniz instead. She said, "Shoowa".
So I told the wayta, "Beh'uh make it two gaggiz all d'way faw d'boat'us".
Afta we ayte, we went back ova to the gavvadj. The mechanic tolt me that it
was my spock plugs and that afta pots and layba the bill was a hunnit
dollis. I jussta 'bout took a hot attack, so I said
"Wadayathink'ahmin'idiot'awwutt"? So he chodged me half p'vice. He tolt the
girl that heuh cah wouldn't be ready ameejitlee and he didn't any loanas.
Since she needed to get to the new Feinstein Seenyiz Centa wheuh she
volunteuhs, I offa'd to d'vive heuh. Aftawoods, she invited me to a potty of
a frenaheuhs in Winsocket. Well, I gotta get home and put my potty outfit in
the warsh. Avvagoodwon!

How much of that can you decipher? Most of it should be easy, but double
points if you know which city they're in and what they had for lunch.
