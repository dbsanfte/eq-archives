While it is official, have they said that this is the absolute final 
version of the character creation process? All I know is that the game 
is slated for release in 2004. That could be December 2004, which still 
gives them 5 more months of adding content. You commented that some of 
the characters didn't have many options, I'm just wondering if there 
will be more options with the final release of the game.
