Then about the only thing I can recomment (besides getting a haste
item), is putting the fastest weapon possible in your offhand.  More
swings = more chances to get a skill up.

Most melee make poor soloers, period.  Monks do alright.  SK's do ok. 
Rangers, against animals, are among the best melee soloers.  Paladins
dont do enough damage and they can't snare.  SK's can snare but not
very well.  Warriors can't heal themselves.  Monks, well, monks solo
very well up to a point anyway...

But none of these classes is going to solo as well as some of the pure
casters.  Druids, necros, wizards, and others will usually solo better
than any melee.  So the question is whether or not you want to be a
pure caster, or if you want to be one of the classes that runs in and
kills things, pulls off the adds, saves that overcasting wizard,
etc,...  A ranger is very fun, and if you ask any high level ranger,
they will tell you that it is probably the most entertaining class to
play.  But they are not for everyone.  Some people want to be the
class with the highest AC or HP.  Others want to be the one that can
always get a group or can always solo (druids, the bastards).

Some do, many don't.

Later on you will realize that you often have to choose between loot
or experience, no matter what you are killing and with whom you are
grouped.
