For my girlfriend and I she wanted a place we could share better than the 
standard 1 room apartment.  So we bought an apartment at Irontoe's East in 
North Qeynos last night and she moved her stuff in (she's much bigger on 
the decorating than I am, I only had my market board to move in).  6.4gp to 
buy, and like 64sp upkeep.  Really super easy to make that in under an hour 
even under level 20, so the cost really isn't an issue.

But yeah, the run back to my tradeskill societies in Castleview does kinda 
suck.
