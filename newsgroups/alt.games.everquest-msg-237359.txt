Ok... so I gave up on Mozilla a month or so ago as an NR mostly
because it got corrupted regularly forcing me to unsubscribe and
resubscribe to all the groups, re-download the headers and lose the
read/unread/ignore status of all the messages... (course that was
1.5... maybe 1.6 is better... or thunderbird...)

So I tried Agent, which is by all accounts very good. And I like it a
lot, except that it doesn't to reverse thread sorting for some
unfathomable reason. (I want recently started threads at the top not
the bottom, organization within the thread is fine). I was able to
make do by filtering it to show just threads with unread messages.

Anyhow all was well until my 'free trial' ran out... now I was
expecting to lose some advanced features like some of the advanced
binaries handling or advanced filtering, but what these guys consider
advanced is pretty scary... "Ctrl-z undo", sorting threads, simple
filtering (i just want to see unread messages...), emptying the
trash...

Anyhow... before I break down and buy Agent I was hoping for any
recommendations of other good free newsreaders. Open source ideally,
but not a req.
