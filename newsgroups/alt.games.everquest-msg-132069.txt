Actually, this is not true.

In the US, an HIV+ person is considered to have AIDS when their virus
counts tops a certain number.  At the moment, I can't recall what this
number is.  Even if this person's viral load eventually drops down to
undetectable levels (usually due to a new regimen of drug cocktails), that
patient is still considered to have AIDS.  (that is, once you go from
being HIV+ to AIDS, you stay there).

Thats not true.  HIV+ people with HIV+ sex partners still need to practice
safe sex, because the virus mutates within the host, esp as it responds to
different drug regimens.  Therefore, someone who is HIV+ and is responding
well to a particular regiment could conceivably be infected with a
different strain of the virus, and they could get really sick at that
point.
