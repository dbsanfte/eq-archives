By the time you're level 60, you should be over 200 INT.  So 10 INT would
not follow that formula, it would follow the "over 200 INT" formula, which
is what, (whatever mana 200 INT is) + 5*(INT-200)?  Something like that.  In
any case, it's not nearly enough mana to declare every race but Erudite
worthless for INT casters, and Michael seems to have gone uber and forgotten
about that thing known as "roleplaying."
