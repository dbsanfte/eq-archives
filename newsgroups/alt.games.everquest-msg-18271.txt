I'm 19th in LOIO and right now I'm building up :

   evocation & conjuration - kiting in battle
    divination - I cammo whilst medding
    sense heading - something to do whilst medding
    foraging - I haven't bought food in eons

1HS is your best mele skill option ... your epic quest weapon is 1HS
