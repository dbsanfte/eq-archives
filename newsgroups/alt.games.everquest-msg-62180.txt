LOL....yeah well....Actually, I have played with the SoV GUI, and like I
said, graphically I think everything has been fixed but the spellbook, which
for all I know could be fixed now too.......I still think the EQ GUI is
cumbersome over all...I mean, when you're used to it, it's not as bad...But
when I tried AO, to me, their GUI was just miles ahead of EQ....example, in
AO you move the pointer over something the name of it pops up, typical
windows GUI type thing...EQ, let's right-click-hold...wait...wait..wait...oh
it's a rusty sword....AO....click the mob, color of his name shows his
"con"....EQ left-click ...hit C...shows "con"....AND one of the most
annoying when EQ first came out you had to open the spellbook and then hit
the med button...And when you forgot the med button or missed it and then
stepped afk, came back NO MANA.....that was annoying..... Maybe I'm just
being picky...But I work in 3d software all day and I'm used to trying to
get through key strokes and clicks as fast as possible....The more I have to
hit, the slower everything goes....

patience? how long does that take?

The questions are coming cause I'm not too busy at work, and I have time to
think about EQ...I can wait for it to come out, but it doesn't hurt to ask
questions....And I know any information I get could be wrong anyway....
