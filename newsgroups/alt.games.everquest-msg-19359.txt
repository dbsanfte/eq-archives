Crowd Control tactics are only partly the responsibility of the
enchanter; the rest of the group has to be on the ball as well. That
means you pick one person who picks targets, and everyone else assists
that person. Also, when all hell is breaking loose and the enchanter is
mezzing stuff, don't attack/stop attacking a mob that has the blue glow
around it when you see the message about the mezz. It's the enchanter's
job to not mezz the mob the main assist and others are attacking; if
he/she is freaking out about you breaking that, then yeah they have
problems. Otherwise, someone else breaking a mezz is someone else
dropping the ball. "A trivial matter, no cause for getting upset" you
say. Ever play a melee class and die even though the healer had tons of
mana just because they weren't paying attention? Ever play a healer and
die because no one got an aggro'd mob off you? Playing an enchanter, and
getting something mezzed through severe poundings and resists, only to
have someone not assisting the main targetter target the mob and break
your mezz is roughly on the same level of frustration (especially when
you've been beaten down to 2 bubs of health and are lom from repeatedly
trying to get the thing mezzed; once it breaks, chances are it's going
to pound you straight into the ground). *You* try being an enchanter in
tough crowd control dungeon situations with people who don't know how to
work with mezz, and see how postal you go.

That said, the most fun I've ever had in EQ has been in tough dungeons
with my regular group of guildmates, playing my enchanter and having
everyone work together like a well-oiled machine.
