Anyone had the above problem since the last patch was done? I keep getting
'EQGame has caused an error and will now quit' error.
To test if this was my pc or not, i logged on with my 2nd pc, onto a 2nd
account, and still got the same error.

it seems to happen when i try and zone, trade or use a vendor.

tried deleting EQClient.ini, EQGame.exe, EQgfx_dx8.dll and EQMain.dll, but
even with the newly downloaded software i get the same errors.

Anyone else getting this?

(waiting for emergency patch)
