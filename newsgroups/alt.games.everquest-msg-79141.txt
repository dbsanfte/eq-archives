That's what we're hoping for.  In Dalnirs and Kaesora, the only monk drops 
I remember us getting were 3 pieces of armor in Dalnirs.  The 31 monk has a 
Jade Mace and something else equally as sweet, and the other monk that is 
AFK for a week has stuff better than Wu's ( I think ), but they have been 
getting shorted on the drops.
