I can't really say.  I don't think I've ever tested doing it from behind the
mob.  The stuns are *very* frequent though... maybe even every time.   At
least I can't remember any time a casting mob was not interrupted by a kick.
(Although, it's been quite a while since I played my warrior much, so it's
possible my memory is faulty.)   (And while I don't remember it, I can't
imagine they would let a kicking warrior stop a raid mob's casting)

Pffft.  Like a paladin would be tanking over me ; P  And as I said, the way
I break mez has worked very well for a long time.

Lucky paladins can rez ; )

Actually the stun animation is what my rogue was keying off of, when the
paladin threw a fit.
