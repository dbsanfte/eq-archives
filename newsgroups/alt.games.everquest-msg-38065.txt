Ah, I was not aware of this change.  Thank you.
The vast majority of my main characters started in Western Antonica (Qeynos,
Halas, or moved from Erudin.)  But it's been a while since any of them have
hunted polar bear cubs in EF... I usually leave that for the newbies.

Sullon was the exception, since 1) it is a new server, and 2) I needed cash
and the faction hits from turning in white polar bear skins (constant
disruptions of hunting made BB unsafe, so not enough fangs to turn in to do
the trick.)  I was quite pleasantly surprised when I found I was averaging
around 1 HQ Bear skin per hunting trip.
