Enchanter. And no. It is definitely not for newbies. You have to know
going into it that the enchanter is damned hard to play or you'll be
nothing but disappointed.

I agree. I love my chanter. But it's not for true newbies and never will
be. It takes a work-aholic control-freak perfectionist to run an enchanter
well.

I would second the Dwarven Warrior or Wood-elf Ranger recommendations.
Both are easy to play and learn the mechanics of the game. Watch and see
what the other classes in the game do - eventually one of them is going to
appeal to you more than the class you're playing.
