Yes, EQ used to use an odd graphics system, I think it was called 'retained
mode' that even Microsoft eventually advised against using. I think it was
the only major game to do so.  This might be what the guy was talking about,
because even though WineX supported DX7, EQ wouldn't run because of the
retained mode it needed.

Since EQ has gone to DX8.1, it might work under WineX eventually. I don't
know anything much aobut COM so I don't know where that might factor in.
