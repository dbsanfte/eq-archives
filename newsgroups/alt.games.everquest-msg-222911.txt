    Nobody in this thread has answered totally negative to all the grief
questions. The people in my guild with minimal grief (my bad, they're
scoring 5%, not 0) are doing just that because that aspect of EQ doesn't
appeal to them in the least.

    For reference, some of my guild's scores.
Achievement/Relationship/Immersion/Grief/Group Affiliation order. Looks like
5% is the minimum score in an area, 95% is the max.

    Rogue, powergamer (65 with 100+ AA's in 15 days /played), abrasive but
loyal: 95/45/5/65/85
    Ranger, easy-going, retired but still posts a lot: 55/95/5/5/45
    Monk, easy-going, roleplays when he can: 85/95/95/5/95
    Paladin, religious IRL, retired from EQ but still posts, helped found
the guild: 65/65/5/5/85
