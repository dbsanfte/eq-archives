Actually, most of my playing time is spent with my husband and/or my older
brother (it's all his fault my husband and I are now playing, Bro has been
playing since the beginning).  On occasion we group up which is fun, too.
Although we've been offered places in a couple guilds, we haven't joined any
yet.

We're spending a lot of time in Butcherblock (good for plat and levelling up
at lower levels) with our lower level characters and Kurn's tower (really
fast for levelling up) for the higher characters.  We're thinking about
moving on to Paludal (sp?) Caverns.  It's supposed to be good for high teens
to thirty or so, or so I've heard.

I have a couple level 16 characters, but I've kinda settled on the shaman
and paladin for my main characters.
