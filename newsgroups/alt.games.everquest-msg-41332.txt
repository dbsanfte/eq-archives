---------------------------------------

Pardon me for injecting in your thread. 
Because I can't just "listen and nod and say 'there, there'", I guess
you'd not consider me a "sensible American", so you can stop reading
here and add me to your killfile filter.

Personally, I thought Sui's first paragraph was well said. I hate the
fact that England and Ireland have killed each other. It's not a trivial
matter to me at all. My sympathy and prayers for the losses and
survivors have never been published in your reading material. I didn't
actually make a trip over there and try to break the fighting up, but
that doesn't mean it's unimportant to me.

It's been my experience that people tend to be cynical when dealing with
others. I can go through life trying to do good and making a difference
when I can, but let me make a mistake and that's what people seem to
remember most. Being from a small town only magnifies it. You may find
it darkly humorous that America is only now "discussing" publically the
things you mentioned, but initial reactions to catastrophes can seem
that way from the safety and comfort of your favorite chair. Terrorism,
like Beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.

I don't believe any terrorist act is "ignored" by our government or any
other government. They are studied and re-studied for reasons and
scenarios we "peasants" can barely comprehend, and I don't think our
reaction was one of wanting to be the "Protector Of The World". In
reality, no single nation can be the protector you think we want to be
and no nation can eradicate terrorism alone.

In your country, and in mine, you're entitled to speak your own opinion.
Sadly, that's not true in many other countries. To me, the gist of your
post hints that "America" happily got what she deserved or, at the very
least, that "It's about time the arrogant SOB's got a taste of some REAL
blood-shed." You just kinda threw in that "It's horrible, it's evil,
it's unspeakable..." for good measure trying to be, as we say here,
"politically correct". If so, I dare say you would not be the first to
"Praise Allah" (or whomever) for striking us "infidels". Heck, maybe one
day you'll even get to see all those prayers answered by something
greater than the destruction of a few "American" buildings and a few
thousand "American" people. You might even see the dream of "America"
eradicated and under occupation by another country's government come
true. Wouldn't that be just...heavenly?

If you yearn to see such a caustic scenario take place, just remember
one thing: those "occupiers" are going to be your lovely Canada's new
neighbors and guess who'll be coming to dinner then? The smoke rising
from Calgary won't be from barbecue pits.
