Why do druids do it better?

In the zones I exp in (PoP) shamans don't solo better than a necro...
neither do bards actually.
Enchanters are getting unreal exp "soloing" using command of druzz.. but its
very risky, and soon to be nerfed

So yeah, put chanter at number 1... but necro and druid would be my second -
and thats not quite what was originally said in this thread
