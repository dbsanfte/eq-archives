Right! I realized I was no longer "challenged" by this by about
level 20 when I was still knocking down low reds while doing
work at home while medding.  Nuke lots, run if you got too

She's passed beyond the "wonder if this will work" stage to
the "holler if you need a port" stage" and will hopefully soon
be in the "get your gnome for the Hate raid" stage.  My
rogue will just have to log in and go up with another wizard.
