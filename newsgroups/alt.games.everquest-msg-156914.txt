Not sure how you have to work it for a General raid, but we did Coercer
pull as follows:  Druid uses Harmony, then Ensnares Coercer which pulls
the whole house Harmony notwithstanding.  Druid commences to kite the
mob of DEs to separate them from the (snared) Coercer, who is tagged by
a Monk lying in ambush Feigned once she's far enough from the rest to
not pass agro.  Monk brings Coercer to our ambush while Druid takes the
pack of unsnared DEs to WC zone.  Did it at night so the zone would be
empty (a few Undead roamers were easily crushed while we waited).  So,
Harmony was useless in the actual event (I'm guessing pathing and/or LoS
issues) and yet we had no real trouble splitting one DE out of that
group (excluding the wipe we endured when they tried a straight Feign
split the first time).
