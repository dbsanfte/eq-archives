It's a bug, and a darned annoying one.  Happens to me all the time in the
Plane of Earth.

The amusing thing is that, while in this state, the mount can be targeted
and attacked.  So whenever I find myself in this situation, I summon my
hammer pet and have it kill the drogmor.  Then I summon a new drogmor and
all is well.

The bug only seems to happen in certain zones, dunno why.
