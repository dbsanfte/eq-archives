 It has not been my experience in over a year and a half of using 
Concussion that landing Concussion adds agro. Rather, it reduces it
conciderably. Chain casting and getting it resisted has never once 
got me agro over a tank. Not ever. In fact, I am certain I can 
start casting Concussion on a very high level MOB (level 65 lets 
say) the second a MT starts his attack, chain cast Concussion during
the whole fight, be resisted every time and never get agro.
 
 You are quite wrong about Concussion. A resisted Concussion definately
does not add you to the hate list like a nuke of any size.
