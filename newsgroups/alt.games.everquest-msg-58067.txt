At lower levels, the upgrade in gear is so minimul, IMO it's not worth
while... unless for example your getting something like a fungi tunic for
your warrior.

I didn't keep upgrading my gear through the levels, I simply went from shit
gear to good gear, wheras some people are constantly upgrading every piece
as their char progresses.    I went on a lot of plane raids, if I got a new
item then great for me... more often then not, oh well no biggie..

The end result is the same, and even if my way didn't save me money... it at
least enabled me to get on with leveling
