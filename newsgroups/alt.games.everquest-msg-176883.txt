I've been to this EverQuest Widows. Lots of talk about how awful the game is
and how it should be made illegal and what's the best way to get hold of
your spouse's (usually husband) password so you can go in and destroy all
his items and delete all his characters. Also how to find guild websites to
see what he's really up to and if he's cheating on you with an in-game
girlfriend.

It'd be funny if it wasn't so sad. These people should live with someone
with a *real* addiction for a while.
