OK, hijacking your post to ask a question.  Why a bard tradeskill
mule?  Or do you have multiple characters on that account?  I
certainly can't see a bard being good at any tradeskill, since they
have low INT, WIS, and STR.  I guess they're good at getting gear for
tradeskills, and once they reach level 5 they're great for moving
stuff around, but wouldn't it be really, really expensive and
masochistic to let your bard do any tradeskills?
