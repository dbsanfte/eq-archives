--Rip It--
October 2002
Lyrics by William K. Mahler
Music by William K. Mahler & Dan Langlias

I
Turned on CNN
Mmm, Gettin' in tune again
I
Turned on CNN
911 associated
Who
Who
Who

It's in the back
In the forefront
It is on my computer screen
It is all your dreams and schemes

I heard you were learning
By your
Accord and choice
Lord has
Given you a high wall

Loving
Rip it
Live it
Live it out
Loving
Just live it out

Uh huh
Uh huh

I am
Coming home
Sometime today
I am walking alone
Tryin' to find my lady
Woman
Leonda
Someday our time will come by
Someday
Someday

...from "W. K. Mahler" with Dan Langlais on electric guitar.  (Where is Dan, 
The Man & The Invisible Band nowadays?)  If he escaped the confines of his 
home confinement set upon by his lovely wife, I hope he knows where to find 
me.:-)


Anyways,  Last month, Curt Schilling, the ACE pitcher of the Boston Redo Sox 
was on T. V. with a Everquest II hat on.  Last night, while reading a 
interview between EverQuest makers and  CNN's Chris Morris,* 
http:www.m2tech.us (co author of many Sci Fi Fantasy Books) I decided to 
download the game 3 pack Trilogy.  1.2 GB's.  It literally sucked up almost 
all my CPU power downloading from Sony.

I'm asking, since PC requirements were not easily found (and I never did 
find them) what are the specifics for play and computer standards?


Thanks,


WKMahler
