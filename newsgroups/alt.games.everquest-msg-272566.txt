    Not just useful, it would also change prices. Some of the crazy 
tradeskill item prices might finally go down when people see a bunch of 
"buy" orders with significantly lower prices, and some of the high-demand 
items might go up in price as players attempt to outbid one another. Having 
"will buy at" as well as "will sell at" information makes it a complete 
marketplace.
