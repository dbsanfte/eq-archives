	If travel is TOO easy, then every point in the world becomes adjacent to
every other point, world size collapses to zero and the entire population of
the game can descend on anything of interest in seconds.

	This is not good.  One of the major problems with UO was the ability to go
absolutely anywhere at will.

	Verant's only real blind spot here is their insistence that teleportation
be done by PCs only.  There should be NPCs at the teleport spots who will port
you for a hefty fee -- say 50 pp.
