Nice :)  We typically kill Emp on pop from server up (Noon-2pm EST) with a
relatively small crew.. which as Im sure you're aware, is a slow process.

One day after dropping Cursed and Emp there was a downage about 2.10EST, by
the time servers came up and emp popped, we had our whole raid crew online,
not just the early bunch.   Was our best time (by far...) dropped emp in 6
minutes
