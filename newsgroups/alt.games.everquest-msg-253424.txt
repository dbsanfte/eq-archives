Well, I hit 65 with my mage today.  Did 3 LDoN's in a row, and when my 
group left the LDoN after success on the last one, I looked around a bit 
with my eye of zomm, found a single pullable mob, soloed it, and dinged.

Fun to ding on a solo LDoN.

Here's the thing; it was fun to hit 65, but its also a let down.  I'm 
leveling driven; I like grinding up, getting new powers, losing old 
opportunities for advancement but finding new ones opening up to me.

Having hit 65, thats the end of leveling.  Sure, I can advance via AA, 
but its really not the same thing, particularly as I don't see any AA on 
the mage list that are even particularly exciting.  And I can advance by 
progression, except that I don't really like raiding and thats what most 
of that is.  And I can advance by gearing up... but frankly for the most 
part a mage's gear doesn't matter, and the stuff that might matter (tier 
2+ focus, FT items, spell casting focus superior to summoned jewelry) is 
mostly raid stuff too.

Leaving spells.  Looking at the spells, I do see some fun toys; charm 
elemental, monster summoning IV, Rath's Son.  Only one of the above I've 
seen in bazaar is the charm one (call of the arch mage), and it retails 
for 50kpp or so.  Never seen a rune for sale.  Runes seem to drop only 
in raids, so again I'd have to start doing that, or else I'd have to 
generate a huge wad of cash.

When I got back from my winter off, I considered starting over, and 
instead decided to stick with my mage and level him up.  Now that I've 
hit 65, I'm back in the same quandry; do I keep playing and see whats 
out there for a non raiding 65 mage, or go back to one of my previous 
characters that hasn't hit 65 yet (or to my 65 cleric, but he's in the 
same boat as the mage), or start over, or heck, finally quit?

Funny thing is, as I level up from 51 to 65, I keep saying I'm not doing 
AA, I'll do that once I hit 65.  Then I hit 65 and I'm not interested in 
getting the AA.  Maybe in the future I'll go 50/50 real/aa, so my 
progress to 65 will take longer and I'll get to see some of the AA at 
work before abandoning the character for someone not maxed out!

Splendid One, 65 Arch Convoker, Firiona Vie
