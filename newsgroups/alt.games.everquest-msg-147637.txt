Kejek catnip is fairly easy to come up with. Just give a chocolate
covered marr cherry to the kitten girl in the Kejekan village in SBM.
(I'd advise several so you have extras in case you forget to
forage-force feed during a raid). +5wis. VERY nice food item. Just
keep a few in your top inventory slot and force-eat forages so you
don't eat the catnip. You still get the stats off of the food that
way...
