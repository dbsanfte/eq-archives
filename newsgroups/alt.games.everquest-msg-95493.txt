Other than a rolled up newspaper whats the best method to housetrain a
tank to stop breaking mezz when they get adds? Jesus H. Christ! ive
never had so much of a hard time in EQ than a 16th chanter trying to
educate the world as to the lifesaving benefits of an AoE mezz (even
at the cost of my life when i mezz the same mob three times then the
tank rushes up and hits it thus turning it on me). Should I just dump
the group the first time they do it? Its not always easy for me to
find a group but maybe I need to move out of oasis. This is getting
damn frustrating cause it seems that on the luclin server all the
experienced players are playing their higher level characters and all
the people 40 and under are brand spanking new to the game. "Whats
mezz mean?" is what i often get when my hotkey ( /cast 2  /g %t is
mezzed....dont touch it! ) is pressed. I tried last night with one
tank to show him when he pulls 4 orcs im gonna target him, then
/assist then cast my spell as he's whacking one and then ask him to
back up a bit to help separate it from the crowd. I know it gets hard
for them to know which one to attack (they wont use /assist). I guess
I just gotta stomache it for the first 50 levels or so until the n00bs
get filtered out of the game. Please tell me they get filtered out.
Please. Am I doing something wrong here by spending so much time
trying to get low levels to use the concepts of MA, /assist and AoE
mezz? I watched a group get 4 adds and even though i controlled them
all with mezz they kept breaking.....2 people died, 2 at one bubble
health and me and the cleric oom but alive. Could have been better. We
could have sat back in a lawn chair with a margarita in hand, only
standing up to recast mezz or heal, and watch them leisurely beat up
one orc at a time. For you experienced chanters out there......what do
I do to elighten the masses?
