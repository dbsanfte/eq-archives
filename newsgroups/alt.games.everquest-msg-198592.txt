But, and this is the bit I don't understand, if they sold JUST the keys,
for half the price of the product, they're selling something with no
physical creation / distribution costs.  Surely they would make even more

I'm sure they have their reasons, but can't understand why I can't buy one
copy of the media, and then several keys.
