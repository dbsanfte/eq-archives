Clerics and Paladins can fear-kite undead this way too.  Unfortunately,
Paladins don't get snare, so fear kiting undead in Oasis can be an
exciting/risky experience.....
Fortunately, most undead in places like NRo/Oasis are fairly slow movers.
Must be those creaky old bones that don't move so fast anymore....

I would not advise fear-kiting undead in places like Unrest.
