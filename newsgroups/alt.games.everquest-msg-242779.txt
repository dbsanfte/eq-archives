I went back again today and tried quadding them. It worked, though
sometimes one of the mercs wanders by and I had to zone. Also sucks
that in wolf form you can poke your head through walls and get adds
that way lol

Anyway on the first quad one of them dropped. On the 3rd quad the same
one dropped. And probably on the 7th quad the other piece dropped.

So I have my spell now, but I will be 51 in maybe a few hours, and no
longer need it lol

I was just killing them singularly before, must have killed 50+ with
nothing. Took me  about 2 hours to get the drops once I started
quadding.

Dunno, nothing at all was dropping when i was snare / root / dot, but
soon as I started quading them everything dropped. Also seemed to get
lots more gem drops too.

Cheers,
