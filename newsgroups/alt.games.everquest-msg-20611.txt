 Old Sebilis
 Howling Stones / Charasis
 Chardok
 Veeshans Peak (Non port/gate zone. You need to fight to exit portals)
 Droga (Once you move in a bit and fall down the pit)
 Kaesora (Once you drop down)
 Dalnirs (Once you drop to another level)
 

 I haven't spent too much time in Velious zones really but I'm sure
someone else can list those.
