You're confusing heals and buffs. You can stack a heal with a heal but
not a buff with itself, so if a buff's stat increases don't match the
increased  mana compared to the previous version, it's still worth it.
With heals, the only way to make it more efficient than the previous
version is to either heal more hps/mana, or have a faster casting
time. Name ONE heal other than Nature's touch that doesn't do that.

Nature's touch won't let me spend any less mana on healing up someone,
all it will do is let me press my heal hotkey fewer times if I am
patching someone up. In its current form, NT will never be my main
heal, as being able to heal in greater chunks at a time (but for the
same cost) doesn't even remotely compensate for the fact that it's too
slow for emergency healing.

Blessing of Aegolism: 60 ac, 1150 hps, 4 peridots.
Ancient: Gift of Aegolism gives 1300 hp and 69 AC.

Protection of the Glades: 24 ac, 470 hps, 6mana/tick
Bulwark of faith, 38 AC
Marzin's mark: 725 hps, 3 peridots
Total: 62 ac, 1195 hps, 6mana/tick, 3 peridots.

We don't often have a 60 druid on our raids, but I am working on it
and have potg sitting in my bank, so when the time comes, I'll be sure
to talk with our clerics and see if we can come to an arrangement.
