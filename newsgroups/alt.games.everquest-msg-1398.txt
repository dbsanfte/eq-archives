Working on your sprinkler yet?

When I play my bro's 55 cleric I never turn down a gift when I rez someone.
Considering I have less than 3k to my name (48 enc, 47 dru, misc others) and
my bro has about the same (pretty much his only char) I could certainly use
the cash. :)

Still trying to talk my brother into starting his.
