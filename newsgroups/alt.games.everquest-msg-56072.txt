Not sure about the stats, but the warrior class gets more hp per sta per
level then any other class. You won't really notice it until level 20 or so.
At level 50 a cleric will only give complete healing to warriors because
other classes simply don't have enough hp to make it worthwhile. A SK or
pally usually gets celestial healing or such.

I'll try to find some stats somewhere later on.
