No flames here :) What you need to do is get yourself to a Wizard spire.
They are located in NOrth Kerrana, Greater Faydark, Toxxulia, and a couple
other places that I wouldnt reccomend trying to get to at level 12 :) Once
there tell the Nexxus Scion that you wish to "journey to luclin". She will
give you a shard that will then enable you to port up to the Nexxus. The
Bazaar is a zone off of the Nexxus. By hailing the guards at the various
exits from the nexxus you can tell where to go.

This all asumes of cours that you have Luclin installed ;)
