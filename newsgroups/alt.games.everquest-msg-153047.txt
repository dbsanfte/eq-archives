Oh the wall guards in Misty are the worst, they will practically run
to the Runnyeye entrance to KS you.  I would actually be happy when
high level players would come to kill the wall guards because then I
actually had a chance to kill a mob (plus the high level players
usually left a few guards in the towers so newbies could still train
mobs to them if they actually were in trouble).
