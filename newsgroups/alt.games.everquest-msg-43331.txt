I believe it's because guys are less inclined to be bothered by the
fact that halflings aren't exactly the most attractive species in game
and focus more on the slight edge the halfling has in unimportant
stats and sneaking. Women, and guys playing a female char for the
purpose of having something hot to look at while they play, lean more
towards the wood elf (I've noticed that guys have a very strong
tendency to pick the blonde model...)
If you see a female halfling, druid or otherwise, odds are very good
it's a roleplayer to at least some extent.
