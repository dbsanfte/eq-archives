In WoW (where mechanics are a bit more transparent than in EQ) it's call
"procs per minute".  IE, Seal of Command procs 7 times per minute 
regardless of weapon speed (a fact that leads to blue weapons outdamaging
purple weapons because they have a slower speed - but I digress :) ).

My understanding from way back in EQ is that all procs there worked like
this - hence the reason AE groups would slow their warrior with the AE
proccing weapon (earthshaker?  something like that) - the slower the 
weapon, the higher the per-swing chance of a proc.
