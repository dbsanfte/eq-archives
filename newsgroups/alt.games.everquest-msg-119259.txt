There was no reason to pay any attention to the gm/guide being in the zone
at the time.. when we realised Tunare was gone, most of us couldn't even
remember the GM/guides name let alone position.. so I can't be positive on
that one.

For me personally it was around 4am, for a lot of the guild it had came
after 11 hours of tedious killing in a horrible zone.

Maybe im not privy to all the information that you are, but as a programmer
(and just a general decent knowledge of os's/computers) I have little doubt
that a guilty person could attempt a cover-up.

Remember the time an asshole GM summoned people to Veeshans Peak and bound
them there?   A place you can't gate/port out of, a place for the lowbies of
the time that was IMPOSSIBLE to get out from.  I remember..

If its a bug, its something completly new (and theres been NO patch since
she's been killed repeatedly across the servers) which makes me believe its
unlikely.  And besides, im still very pissed off about it, it was a major
dissapointment to a lot of people, after a LOT of effort.
