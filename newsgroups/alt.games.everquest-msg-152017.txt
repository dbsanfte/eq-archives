Can't help too much but don't expect to find anywhere selling an MX300 as
Diamond stopped making them before S3 Anally raped the company. I have a
feeling Aureal no longer produce the Vortex chipset anyway, at least I
couldn't find anything using it, recently. Shame, it was the best gaming
sound card I had.

Just checked link given, Aureal don't even exist anymore apparently :�(

Did this include the partition with EQ on it?
The texture issues I had something similar (although no crashes) and
corrected it by copying the EQ dir from another PC.
I would agree that the crashes are likely due to onboard sound, I disabled
mine straight away and use the barely supported SBlive card with Win2k but I
do have problems in Q3 as well as EQ (basically sound works except for music
in EQ and sometimes I miss a second of sound in Q3) I would suggest getting
a cheap SB128 and disable the onboard chipset from Bios.

As for everything else working fine except in EQ, well that is simply
because they don't make software like EQ anymore...most companies have a QA
dept to stop it getting out :�)
