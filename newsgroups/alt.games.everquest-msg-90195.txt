Back several years ago, when Diablo (the game, not the 'satanishy'
type guy) was king, Alt.Games.Diablo was a simple, fun place to hang
out.  During that lost Camelot-like era, many of the people there took
turns creating fan-fics (fan fictions) to entertain those of us with
absolutely no writing talent whatsoever.  

Your post brought a smile to me, as it reminded me very much of those
days gone by.  :-)
