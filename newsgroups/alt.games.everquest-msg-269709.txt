For EQ1, a bard needs Int for manapool.  Stamina increases hitpoints for 
all classes, the rate at which it increases is class dependant.  It's 
basically a fixed number of added hp per level, but, once Stamina is over 
200, the rate of increase is smaller as I recall.  For charm, it's a good 
idea to have a high charisma, as that has been shown to increase the 
liklihood of the charm sticking for the full duration.
