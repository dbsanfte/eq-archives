As I don't play a cleric, I can't tel you what your "job" is, but I can say 
that those that DO play have given some good advice.  Personally, I (a 
wizard, btw) would rather take the death than my healer.  I can be rezzed 
for xp or to get back to the fight if need be.  If my healer dies, I am 
probably not far behind!  Therefore, if the crelic in my group(s) starts 
taking hits (or the 'chanter, for that matter), I do what I can to keep 
them alive...if It means I get killed, then I die.  Hopefully I can get teh 
mob off them long enough for the tank to get them again. (I've long 
outgrown the anger at getting dead...it's a GAME after all!)

I agree totally with this.

Again, total agreement.  I *DO* get agro from time to time (less often as I 
progress, thank God!), but it's either from over-nuking (my fault) or the 
tank(s) getting dead (maybe from wandering adds, maybe from bad luck)--
generally. I even go so far as to tell the cleric beforehand not to wory 
about me if I get agro, unless I drop below 50% hp...and even then to worry 
about saving the group before me.  And this method HAS gotten me killed 
before...once.  (It must be pointed out that had the cleric turned to heal 
me, then it woulda been a total wipe...no hard feelings, no harm, no foul.)

While there are some jerks that will talk trash about the party wiping and 
the cleric not saving everyone, the majority of the people I have grouped 
with take it in stride. "Well, at least I'm FOM again" sort of comments.  
Almost every time I've been in a group that wiped, the cleric felt really 
bad, while everyone else took it in stride.  *I* feel bad for the *CLERIC* 
when there's a bad situation.  Maybe a wipe, maybe onyl partial.  It seems 
the healer takes it personally if they can't prevent it.  Well, it happens.  
Mostly from overpulls, I'd say, or TONS of adds.

I'm rambling, but to finish off, I'd say that if the above situation 
happens, kick yourself ONCE if you feel you must, then get back in and do 
what clerics do best....heal, nuke, and keep the bad-pulling-warrior alive 
while HAVING FUN.  Anyway, if someone can't accept a bad situation or a 
screwup or even admit THE are at fault, don't take it personally...you just 
learned who NOT to group with again.
