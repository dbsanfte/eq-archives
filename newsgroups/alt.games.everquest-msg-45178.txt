You got the first and most important part done, everything else is
downhill.

Remember, you have it a LOT easier than previous Hate raiders.  Your
weapons are better, your armor's better, fucking idiotic mobs in that
useless brain-damage pathing zone have no pets (who remembers those
infamous..."Ummm, where's that spite's pet?"  Followed closely by, "OH
SHIT CLERICS CAMP NOW!!!").

Just ask what you should and shouldn't do when it comes time to port
up.  Generally, if it's your first time, you won't be part of the
break in so should be easier.
