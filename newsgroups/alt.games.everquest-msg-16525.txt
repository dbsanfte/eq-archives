What the heck!  I joined a guild today and was talking to the guildleader. I
asked him how many members there were.  He gave me a number and said it was an
approximaation.  I asked him why just an approximation, and he went on to tell
me there was no command to display a list of guild member, not even for the
guild leader.  I asked how he would know someone were to disband from the
guild, and he said there was no way for him to know.  Is this true?  Before
sending an e-mail off to Verant (as if it would matter - not Verant bashing,
just saying that one soul out here doesn't matter so much) I want to know if
this is really true or if the guild leader simply doesn't know  all of  his
commands.  

It just doesn't make sense to me that there isn't a way of keeping track who is
and isn't in your guild especially if you are the guild leader.  Sure, you can
hunt them down  -maybe-  and ask them, but a simple /guildmembers command would
make one heck of a lot more sense to me.  Am I off the wall on this one guys or
what?

Sandy
