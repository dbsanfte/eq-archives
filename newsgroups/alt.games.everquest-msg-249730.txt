hmmm....it doesn't look like anyone here has suggested my favorite way to
make money: tradeskills.  i started out with tailoring.  go to eqtraders and
follow the guide there until you reach 88, then just make handmade backpacks
for a while.  on FV, you can buy the high quality pelts for about 20pp and a
stack of patterns from the merchant for about 10pp.  that's about 20.5pp per
bag, then sell them for 50, no farming required.

after you reach a point in your research where you can make the research
only spells without failing too much, switch over to that.  the words for a
spell could cost anywhere between 1 and 100pp, and the average selling price
for spells of that level is about 200 or more.  so if you sell 5 spells over
night, that's at least a 500pp profit, many times more.  i've made over
1000pp in one night doing this, so it can really pay off.
