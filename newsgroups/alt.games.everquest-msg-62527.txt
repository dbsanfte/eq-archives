Yay!  A fellow firepotter!  Follow all advice below - very sound.

Easiest way to get there is to take the Oasis barge, and start swimming due
south once it zones to TD.  The fall gets me for about 100 with 94 Safefall,
so be ready for 200-ish.

At -12200, 4360 you'll see the tips of the submerged spires, swim down, into
the tunnel and brace yourself for impact.  Once you're in there, only way
out is to use the Firepots (or Gate/'Port/TL, duh)

If you need further info on the room itself, I've got it well documented at
my site (see Sig).  It includes exact destination shot of each firepot, etc.
