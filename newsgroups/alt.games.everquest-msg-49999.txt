Hail fellow EQers,

I need some help on velious faction issues.  At the moment I can
threatening to giants and apprehensive to codiants. I would like to
enhance my faction with giants to doubtious so I wont be in any danger
in their city, Also i would like my faction with Cod to be at least
duobtious, Is there a way to do it?  Basically I need a faction rised
while as the other one not droping too much.

Another question is that does velious armor or ring quest require your
faction better than indiff?  Is that's the case than my sneak sell/buy
tactic wont work on those quest :-(

Thanks in advance for help.
