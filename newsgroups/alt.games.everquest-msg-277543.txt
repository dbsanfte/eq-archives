1. Do I understand correctly that there will be no character transfers to 
Stromm afterward?

2. My highest level characters (outside of FV) are on Saryrn. I stopped 
playing there long before EQ2 came out, because it was getting to be a 
ghost town at the mid-levels. I see an opportunity now to possibly get some 
more mileage out of them. Assuming no transfers to Stromm, are there any 
other servers with a healthy lower- and mid-level population that I might 
consider transferring to?
