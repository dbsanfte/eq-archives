It was 4 people all within a 6 level range.  But the dungeons are
supposed to be tailored to the average level of the party, so it should
have been just as difficult for us as it should have for 4 level 20s or
6 level 65s.  Assuming this is more or less the case, my conclusion is
that the "normal" setting isn't very hard, and thus quite doable for
casual pickup groups that are less than well constructed (come on, we
had no mezzer and a shaman who was generating about half the mana she
could have been?...  I know a necro is a mezz class, but this one was
-not-)

If you are doing dungeons in 30 minutes when there's a 90 minute time
limit, then again, my conclusion is they are pretty easy, supposedly
scaled for your average level.  Thats fine by me, casual pickup groups
can do "normal" with some confidence, and if you feel your group is all
that and a slice of toast then hit the "hard" button and get better
rewards at a higher risk.  I'm told, by the way, that hard is 3 times
as hard and 50% more reward... but you could do 3 times as hard in 90
minutes if you can do normal in 30, and half again is half again, plus
I assume there's 3 times the exp to be had if its 3 times as hard.

Thats pretty sad cash, still far better to go to RM hill giants or any
of a dozen less well known cash camps on a cash per hour basis.  The
exp isn't too bad, though, but the loot you describe seems to suck; if
you spent that same time in Seb Crypt or something you'd be walking out
of there with several items sellable for several Kpp, instead you get
two augments you can't even sell, and not particularly impressive
ones?  How many adventure points did you earn, perhaps thats the real
reward part of the LDoN?

Splendid
