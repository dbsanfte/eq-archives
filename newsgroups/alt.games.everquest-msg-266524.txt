I'd be shocked if that doesn't happen again.  Look at recent history in 
Serbia re Muslims.  Look in Algeria now re black Muslims vs non black 
Muslims.  It's still happening today, it has happened throughout history, 
and, likely, will continue to happen as long as there is some perceived 
difference that can be used to justify such actions.  You'd have to be 
completely blind and oblivious to human history and human nature to think 
otherwise.
