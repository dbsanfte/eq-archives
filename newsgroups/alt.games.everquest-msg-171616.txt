If, in addition to her saying things, there were messages that specifically
stated that your faction got worse with various factions, then it means you
have lowered your faction, I don't know by how much, and whether or not they
will kill you depends on how much your faction went down, and what your
faction was to begin with.

No, beyond the message you get from conning a character on the appropriate
faction, which tells you where in a broad range your faction standing is.
i.e. ally, kindly, warmly, indifferent, dubiously, scowling (probably missed
one or two).

The best way to raise factions will depend on the specific faction.  For
some there are good quests, for some there are mobs that will give you huge
faction boosts.  For some there are only very slow ways to raise faction,
and for some, there is no way to raise faction.  Off the top of my head, I
don't know the best way to raise the factions you are inquiring about.
