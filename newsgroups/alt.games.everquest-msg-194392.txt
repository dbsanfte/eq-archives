    I'll assume your damage and mana numbers are correct.

    Winter's Frost has the highest DMG for cold nukes, but it doesn't even
come close to the efficiency of ADoI. Heck, it's not as efficient as Ice
Spear of Solist, and that's a Velious-era spell. Compare what the two
classes can do: a druid chaining WF can get 172 DPS, spending 43 mana per
second. A wizard chaining Ancient: Destruction of Ice, Ice Spear of Solist,
and Concussion can get 145 DPS, done at a -10 CR check, with a higher chance
of a critical and a higher multiplier if he does critical, and shed 400 hate
every 16.5 seconds, all for a little under 35 mana per second. And that's
assuming that Cold is the only damage type that a wizard can land on a
target. We also haven't included the effect of Iceflame of E'ci, a WIZ
self-buff that acts as a 30% cold damage focus on Ice Spear and ADoI. At
average (15%) damage increase, that knocks the WIZ's cold DPS up to about
167, and at max damage increase allows him to hit for 1560 with either ADoI
or Ice Spear.

    I haven't even begun to compare the inherent mana regen rates available
through AA's or "standard" gear like WIZ epic, but if I did, WIZ would be on
top. I also haven't compared mana discount rates for the EVOC-specialized
WIZ versus the likely-not EVOC specialized DRU. Really, wizards are so far
ahead of everyone else it's insane.

    Again, what you want to look at for pillar AoE's isn't the max damage,
it's the efficiency. And wizards blow druids out of the water on that,
unless you have mobs that can't be fire nuked. If that is the case, then the
wizard needs to quad with Pillar of Lightning, and gets 848 damage per 344
mana, a DMG/mana of 2.47. This is the only case where a druid approaches a
wizard's efficiency.

    ADoI is Luclin-era. It may be sitting on a Velious mob in addition to
Luclin mobs, but look at when the spell was released.

    Well, other than the 30% increase of Iceflame of E'ci, and the enhanced
DPS of Draught of E'ci (does 181 DPS when chain-cast, with an inherent -50
resist mod, spending 48.5 mana per second). So the wizard can either blast
for 167 average DPS, only accepting a -10 mod to resists, and shed 400 hate
every 16.5 seconds (assuming he doesn't have Ancient: Concussion), and
sustain this rate longer than the druid, or go all-out and get 181 DPS at
a -50 resist mod. The druid can get 172 DPS, can't shed hate, has no resist
mod. Oh, and if the wizard has a stationary target, can also throw in the
odd Tears of Marr (another PoP spell), an 850/wave cold-based rain for 425
mana (6 DMG/mana, 4.2 DMG/mana factoring in the inherent 30% resist rate
rains seem to suffer). Including the 30% resist rate on rains, that gives
the WIZ the ability to go all-out for a whopping 208 DPS, all cold-based.
Hmm, who is the better cold nuker?
