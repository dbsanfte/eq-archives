There is a weight difference.  The mandolin weight 0.0, as I recall, and the lute
is about 1.0.

It's similar, but there are a few differences:

1) It's not a targeted AE spell like the level 4 harmony is, so you need to cast it on all mobs.

2) It can fail.  If it fails, there are two possible results: nothing happens, or you aggro that mob
and any other mobs that are within their frenzy radius.  The odds of nothing happening are
related to your CHA stat.  The higher the CHA, the lower the chance that a failure will cause
aggro.

That said, I've had pretty good luck with that song when I've used it.  I don't use it that often,
though.  I often partner with a ranger who has harmony, and so KLL only comes in handy indoors.
