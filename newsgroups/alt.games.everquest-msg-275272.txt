If you read through the following case, you'll find that the right
of people to use privately owned property for signature gathering
among other things stems from a 1st and 14th ammendment ruling:

Alabama vs. Marsh (US Supreme Court, 1946)

Which the Oregon Supreme Court then used in Lloyd Corporation vs. 
Whiffen.

The problem with the first case in which Fred Meyer lost the ability
to ban signature gatherers from the Hawthorne store was that they failed
to demonstrate that the Hawthorne store did not meet the requirements
to not be considered a public meeting place (contending the burden of
proof rested on the signature gatherers) in the second case they
demonstrated that the (remodeled) Hawthorne store clearly did not invite
people there for more than business transactions.  Now, you'll notice
that they didn't try this with the Beaverton store, which has a number
of shops renting space from them and is much closer to a shopping
center than a single store.
