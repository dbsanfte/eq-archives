You thrash oh so very well!  You may believe what you will,  anyone with
even a passing knowledge of the english language or how to read a map
will have no troubles seeing where it has been conclusively proven, both
by my words and your highly inappropriately posted map that you were in
fact making it up when you said you were standing on the path at those
coordinates and could see the shadowmen.  There  is no other possible
conclusion to be reached as those coordinates are not on the path.  

Why you have chosen to continue to dispute that I don't know and don't
care.  That is not even the point, its in the past, what is done is
done.  The future is my concern and should be yours as well.  Will you
limit yourself to posting actual facts or will you continue to post
things you make up, that is the issue.  No need to respond here, the
only response that matters is the choice you make in your future
posting.  If you continue to mislead folks I can only assume you do so
with full knowledge of what you are doing and it is in fact not a simple
mistake, but rather malice that drives you to post falsely.  Let your
actions demonstrate your intent not more protestations of what is
clearly fact.
