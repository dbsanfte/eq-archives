Hmmm.  As a lo fifties Paladin I have <never> been asked to join a
group outside of Lower Guk.  In fact, I can think of precisely two
occasions in the last six months where I was able to join a group
that didn't already include at least one guildmate.  When your class
is not well regarded you just don't get groups (ask a Rogue about
that, heh).  I've gotten more than half of my experience since level
35 or so solo.  Irregular play times, and play times subject to
frequent interruption, combined with an "undesirable" class and the
fact that solo and solo/bot play have become easier and easier over
time pretty much leave me stuck soloing most of the time still.
There are zones where pick-up groups are feasable, if you're a shaman,
cleric, enchanter, or monk.  Hell, at my current level (54) I'd bet
a Rogue could probably find a group with a lot less trouble than me.
