 And I seriously want to know how one goes about "breaking" a CD anyway.
I can bend one almost in half and it still won't break. I've been using
Compact Disks for almost 20 years and have never come close to breaking
one. I've even got a few that are scratched all to hell and they STILL
work fine.
 
 I suppose if you dipped a CD in liquid nitrogen and hit it with a hammer
it might shatter...
