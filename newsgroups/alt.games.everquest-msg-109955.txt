That was my take on it as well.  I can't say that it is not a pain to do
strafe running, but it has saved my butt on numerous occaisions, and I have
never used the mouse to do it.  I don't actually even know how to control
movement with the mouse.  I have never chosen to learn how, because, well,
it seems so stupid.
