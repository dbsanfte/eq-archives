Yet another story of morons of EQ...

Scenario #1
Frontier Mountains.  Full group.  One idiot in the mix telling the Bard (me)
how to Bard.
I'm fairly new to the game and far from Uber, but I've had people complement
me on my twisting, I can usually keep up 4 songs as long as the graphics
engine doesn't get too bogged down.  That tends to slow down the twisting.
Anyway, this guy keeps telling me ONLY PLAY THE FOLLOWING SONGS!  Health
regen, anthem d'arms, and Guardian Rythms because that's what HE does with
his Bard.  I informed him that we have casters and I can exchange regen with
clarity and with a Cleric and Druid there is no need for regen anyway, and
Guardian Rythyms is for magic resistance and giants aren't casters.
JUST PLAY SONGS #5,10, and 17 or we don't want you.
Bye...oh yes, I advertised for a group and his whole troup joined up with me
right next to him.  :-)

Scenario #2
Frontier Mountains.  Full group.  Number of idiots not quite known at this
time.  Bard, you pull.  Not a good idea I say.  We can let the SK pull.  If
I pull we lose mana song during any possible downtime.  Bard, you pull...
Ok, I'll pull.  I pull one, another spawns right in front of me, then I see
in group chat "pop at door".  They meant BOTH popped.  I made it through
with 1/4 of my health to group spot.  Ahhh yes!  The Cleric will heal me!
Heal please!  I turn around and am getting pounded.  There had to have been
at least 6 or 7 giants.  I ran like a French soldier with selos and a drum.
"Where are you going???"
"Yes, our wonderful Bard", etc...
They were all pretty close to full health.  I didn't see anyone attack the
giants when I stopped and I had no heal coming.  I made it to zone with less
than 20 hp.  Where am I going???  Indeed...

Scenario #3 (last one!!!)
Splitpaw.  Full group.  All idiots, myself included...
I enter and announce I'm LFG.  Come to mr, we have a good group!  Ok, I get
there and it's a Cleric and a Druid only.  More are coming.  Ok I say.  All
that came were casters and hybrids.  2 Druids, 1 Cleric, 1 Chanter, and 1
Wizzie.  Bard you tank...God I hate that phrase!  We'll have to charm or
mezz the adds says the Chanter.  You can charm and mez, right Bard? says the
Chanter.  I should have left right then.  That's why I include myself in the
idiot column in this situation, because I didn't.  DAMMIT!  The first few
pulls in the mr were a little hairy as nothing had been taken out yet.  The
very first pull I was mezzing one, charming another, and tanking a 3rd with
charm.  These guys are screaming for mana song for godsake when mez after
mez, charm after charm are only taking like 50%.  I didn't see a root until
I was down to 1 mob.  Once they were dead (and me very close behind) did
these guys even try to heal me.  They were wimpy little heals at that, so I
don't think the Cleric was even helping.  Again I'm too stupid to leave this
shitty group.  The next pull was the fatal one.  Charm failed everytime and
was attacked by 3, getting friggin' backstabbed to death.  No heals, no
roots, no help.  I was bound in Freeport, so cr took quite awhile.  These
guys are still fighting stuff from what I read in group chat.  About 10
minutes later (I swear it was that much later) the enchanter asks where the
Bard went.  OMFG! NOOO!!  They were also whining why was it taking me so
long to get back.
Got my corpse without a hitch, except I finally found out why I was told to
not die at level 31.  I have seen very few groups with a Cleric where the
Cleric wasn't almost nauseatingly apologetic for losing someone.  This was
one of them.  In fact no-one even acknowledged that I died unless it was
"hurry up and get back here" type of stuff.

I left, but on my way out, I ran around the spawns in the first 2 rooms with
AE fear on.  I hope they all fucking died...

'Til later,
Sean...

p.s. watch who you group with!  Most people are cool, so it's pretty easy
for a nimrod to squeak through.
