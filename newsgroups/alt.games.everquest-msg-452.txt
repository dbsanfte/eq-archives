I dont play Rangers (did to 13th once), but my friend does,
and I actually like Rangers. We were talking about the subject of
Rangers and Archery. It dawned on me, having never seen this
discussed, that a simple fix might work out from Rangers and Verants
perspectives both. It occurs to me Verant doesnt want Bow Kiting,
players want effective Archery. That said, is it not possible to
allow a critical hit *each time* a Ranger does not move for the
duration of the Bows delay?

	This may not be a good idea, but it seems to be easily
implementable (casters have this limitation for movement before
casting), and might make archery worth using, and would not allow
kiting. Bow and arrow damage/delays might need a revamp, but it
seems to me that it might be worth a 'shot'. They could, with the
new Hybrid spell fix, still cast spells also. Well, it seems easy
to say, I wonder if it would actually be a good balanced fix.

Agreed, and would fit in nicely with my above suggestion.
