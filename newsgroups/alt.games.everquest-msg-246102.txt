Without going into too much detail that would justify the 
"dumbing down" comment, my 54 ranger was at 24 or so health.

To try out the new regen, I sat on my butt the whole time (BW 
stinks anyway, I had my main's Fungi for most of my xp time). 
Without any AA's, fungi, or other regen, my regen started at 
7/tick and got all the way to 42/ tick. Unfortunately, I didn't 
time when each went up but I'm sure someone will eventually. I 
was so excite that I was regenning faster than my 65 monk WITH 
her innate regen, Ornate Sleeve, pitiful AA's and Fungi that 
timing wasn't high on my list

I only had about 2k of hp's so I'd like to hear if an uber 
warrior would go up even higher with 6k or so to heal. But, I can 
say from experience that it goes up to at least 42/tick for 54 
rangers
