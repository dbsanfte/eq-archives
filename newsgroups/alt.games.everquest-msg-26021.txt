Eventually you will probably want to join a guild and when you do don't just
join blindly on the strength of an invitation.  Watch the players in that
guild and note their behavior, group with a few and see how you like the way
they play, and above all listen to what they have to say in chat.  Also ask
friends in the guild about it, how it is organized, what problems it has,
what are their aims and what is to be expected of you and what the guild has
to offer you.  When you find a guild that meets your needs join it with the
provision that if it turns out you do not like it after all you will leave
and above all remember that the command guild remove give you a way out of
any uncomfortable situation.  Also be aware that many of the larger more
powerful guild do not admit new members until they are in their 40s or
higher, so take your time look around and eventually you will find what
works for you, and til then continue what you are doing.
