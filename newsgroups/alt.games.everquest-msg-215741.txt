No, he's not.  With a Shaman's superior mana flow he can outheal a
Cleric in certain situations.  And, if your tanks are hybrids (incl.
Ranger still in 30s) agro won't be an issue (unless your hybrids are
clueless, but why would a soloable character like a Shaman group with
clueless melees?).

Much greater in some situations, assuming tank(s) can hold agro and
and you're not doing something that requires routine CHeals for a
high HP tank.  As for agro control, a L30 Paladin has 3 fast casting
stuns (1.5sec, 1.8sec, and 1.5sec) that he can cycle as much as
necessary to insure that a mob hates him more than anybody else.
SKs also have ways to build lots of agro fast, as do Rangers.  Really,
a Cleric's healing vs. mana and healing vs. agro efficiency are not
necessary unless you have a Warrior tank.
