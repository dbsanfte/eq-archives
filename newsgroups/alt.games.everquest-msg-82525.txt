I think Stonebrunt is highly underrated. It's really safer and easier
to get to than LOIO. I think the problem is still people have a
pre-formed bad opinion of it because of the TLC. Since that has been
lifted, it's really a much better place to be. Heck, there's actually
a place to buy food there, which is a huge step above LOIO. ;-p
