Considering there's only three in the zone at any given time, I'd say that
your idea is kinda off the wall. Not to mention that it would have to be a
high-level druid (with Fist of Karana, the level 57/58 AE, forgot which
level) who was feeling suicidal. You realize how difficult it would be to
round up four 500AE+Disspell-casting mobs into an AE-able group?

Wyverns, yes. Cobalt Drakes, no. Not without some heavy MR/CR gear. =)

Personally, I've taken two at a time. I ended up losing both to those stupid
KS'ing otters though .. Got too close and one AE'd, hitting some otters from
below. =\
