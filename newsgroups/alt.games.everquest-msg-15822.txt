I love the denial up to the point Brad reproduced the /guild d00d
speak. ;-P

With so many games about to come out, Verant is setting a tone of
(relatively that is)  non-exploitive and d00d minimal online gaming.
In the end, all that will make the difference in the online gaming
glutted market will be the integrity, or lack there of, of the maker's
game. 

Look at the bright side, the 28 can go over to WWII and find the
exploit that allows a rifles to destroy a tiger tanks and use third
person software that gives players the ability to have a HUD map that
also mark the position of all players and the creators may decide that
it just fine with them.

They knew they were exploiting, they knew what verant said they would
do if caught, talking about how others do it doesn't diminish their
guilt and basically they display a pathological behavior of exploiting
by their knowledge on the subject, you don't walk into a dragon's lair
and just exploit on a whim. You can bet this was this was going to be
the cheery on top the sunday of exploiting MoBs, they just aimed their
exploit a little to high for their own good.
