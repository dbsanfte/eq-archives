And if it was a joke?? Then what?

Everybody knows that early adopters pay more. The goofball was complaining
because he figured out if he'd waited four years he'd have saved a hunrdred
bucks on the expansions... I merely pointed out that by waiting he would
have saved a bundle on subscription fees too. OF course then he'd have
missed out on four years of game time... but what of it... he clearly would
prefer to save a few bucks...
