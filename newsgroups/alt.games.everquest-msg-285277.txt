Yep, the 0 to 60 play of WoW doesn't take as long as the 0 to whatever
grind in EQ.  Personally, I found WoW to be "deeper" in terms of
gameplay than EQ while leveling.  Seems like most of the time in EQ
you are sitting in one spot, killing the same mobs over and over and
...  As far as I'm concerned, that's not depth.

Once you get to level 60 in WoW and you are doing instances, you have
all the depth you can handle.  If your group or raid doesn't know how
to play or what to do, you'll be running back from the graveyard
*very* quickly.  I've found the boss encounters in WoW to be far more
interesting and imaginative than the (few) raids I went on in EQ.
