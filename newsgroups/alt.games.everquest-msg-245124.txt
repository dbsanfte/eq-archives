I don't think so (i don't recognise the name). The board i refered to is
called Feigned, you may have seen it on some MB peeps sigs.

I was just a third party for the knight v warrior wranglings in PoP, and now
GoD, and I totally agree.

After being tanks of choice for so long, it really makes my heart bleed to
see the whiney ranting Paladins (aproaching monk levels of whining) crying
about no role for them in GoD.  Some of the potime people (who you'd think
would know better..) are no help either... talk of quarm geared people
unable to tank Trials 5 and 6 (tipt and vxed), least of all the named..

I've done a tipt trial with moderate DPS group(monk / paladin / beast /
cleric / well i can't remember the rest..) and Paladin tank, anyway he
tanked every mob fine.. we killed all mobs without a death

I myself have tanked named mobs in the other trial (vxed).. so if a monk and
paladin can do it.. well to hear "top" SK's and Palis claim its impossible
is a joke.

They had a real good thing going, now its not to rosey.. the tears come
flooding. Fuck that, fuck people who are never satisfied, people who think
their class must be the dominant class throughout every expansion.

In PoP, Sk's too were friggin gods. The class balance thread by an SK
(mostly full of bad info) who isnt nerfed or gimped, but isnt automatically
the best anymore is another example of people who really need to stfu, get
on with what they are dealt, and deal with it or quit. If there are issues
and problems, so be it. But when the only issue is "wha wha im no longer the
best!! even tho i didnt get weaker".. cry me a fucking river, knights!
