I am now part of that "sad" bunch of people with twin accounts to EQ.
Basically many of my R/L friends have been quitting and I have been gaining
some extra equipment and now the use of an account, well, I have the use of
it until it's cancellation incepts, then I may or may not take it on.
Nothing really major there. Most of the equipment has been randomly handed
out to people (not sure who got the ogres crafted but I bet they were happy)
I think the Necro is the highest level character on there (mid 40's) but if
I had wanted to play a necro I'd have done it long ago. More importantly, I
now have access to a Druid in his 40's (this means heals, buffs and snares,
w00t) which will hopefully get my Warrior thru the high 40's. I have been
having trouble getting into groups anywhere now. Can no longer find groups
in DL's at 47 and pickup groups in dungeons are not viable (takes far to
long)

After I reach 50 (and finally get top proc my sword) I just need to get on a
dragon and plane raid and then I too may quit :�/
We'll see, although the fact that I can now port myself to locations where
before I'd normally use "public" transport as well always having a partner
when I can't find a group in time, may renew my interest. EQ doesn't and
never has, favoured the casual player, like me,  I know this is one of the
things that DAoC are trying to "put right" but I wonder if this will detract
from the addictiveness of the game if they succeed.

Wonders if he'll now get flamed as I am technically breaking the EULA :�)
