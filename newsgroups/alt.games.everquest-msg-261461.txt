Indeed, I thought at least half of the section on autosplit
could be eliminated.  In particular, no need to extend the
examples to include 4pp, 5pp, etc.  Just give the examples
of why 1-3 pp splits can be unfair, say "etc." and be done!

Yes and no.  I have yet to get to levels where I encounter any of
those mob tactics, but I still see the terms bandied about in
discussions.  It's useful to have at least a brief description of
what they mean.  (Yes, I know there are various glossaries posted,
but things like "What does rampage mean?" are still FAQs.)
