I know that if a jacinth drops, as a GM jeweler,  i will ask for it as 
my only split of the loot, and in general get it, and also the 
'commission' to make a piece of resist gear or other JC item for party 
members...only thing i ask for is the ingredients and i do the combines. 
Most people are thrilled to be able to bypass trying to buy finished 
goodies in bazaar and just have to worry about collecting components=)

them but 'you' logged before i remembered i have them...i plan on 
sending 'you' a tell next time i am in game at the same time as you are.]
