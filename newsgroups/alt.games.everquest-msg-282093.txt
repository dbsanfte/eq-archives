Yes. Agnarr should not be required for Sol Ro access, unless something
has changed.

No. Well, you can hail, and it should even let you in to PoF if there are
enough flagged in the raid, but you will not have real PoF access. The
Sol Ro requirement for PoF is in addition to the requirements for the
other elementals, Agnarr should block you from that.

Pre-grats and good luck in the elementals, though.
