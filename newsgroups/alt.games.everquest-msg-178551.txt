I find my DE necro to be great fun.  It's a chance to let faction go by 
the wayside as you torture the cute, the adorable, the wood elves and 
the halflings.  There's nothing quite so satisfying as choosing a 
target, slowing it to an agonizing, pain-filled crawl, filling it's mind 
with terror, and casting multiple slow, agonizing deaths on it.

Maybe they could throw Mistmoore back in and pit them against each other 
;p
