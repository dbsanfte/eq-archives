Point conceeded.

I (mainly) play melee classes, and after leveling up my first rogue
to 60 when the old world and Kunark were the only thing going, I
haven't had the balls to play a melee/hybrid of ANY kind without
some sort of regen gear (even "just" an iksar BP).  My monk was
born with a Fungi and TBoots.

But then again, none of my "alts" besides my alt rogue are really
fun to me to play.  My naked wizard with TBoots and a dragoon
dirk was leveled just for the heck of it (to show it could be done),
and lives mainly as a port mule.  My druid (actually my brother's,
but he doesn't use that account much anymore) languishes
as a 'port/heal/damage shield mule for AA sessions with my
main.

I do know that I had gotten out of a raid with my main and
switched to my alt not too long ago, and was lamenting the
fact of how slow her rogue epic seemed to be (main has
40% and the belt from the THO, with a 50% haste-spell
right click...a rogue that can self-haste himself to 90% is
scary...now I just need a bard around...).

It DOES kind of skew your reality...
