Eventually everyone will tire of EQ whether or not they move to a new
mmorpg. How many games does a person actually play for more than four
years?

Games that age or older on my computer: Star Control 2, and... um, I
can't think of any others. Halflife I suppose but I only play
Counterstrike and that's not four years old yet. It's not like I don't
have a lot of good games, it's just they do have a lifespan before I
don't get much out of playing them anymore.

Of course that's just me but I find it hard to believe I am really
that different from everyone else. As time goes on EQ will be fighting
the decline caused by people just deciding they've had enough fun,
time to try something (and not necessarily an mmorpg) else.

And IMO, that snowball will be rolling quite quick after PoP's novelty
wears off. It's not a fault of EQ, just the natural order of things.
