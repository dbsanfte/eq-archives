NK can be a dangerous zone.  Not nearly as bad as it was when the
Swarms were an issue, but even still, far from what I would call a
newbie zone, either.  And there are times that the guards are a nice
escape valve.  I freely admit I use the guard tower as a med spot at
times, only because I know the chances of getting agro'd are low, and
it is a lot more convenient than zoning into SK...

But, by the same token, dropping Grim, or any Griffon or HG on a guard
is no better, or no different, than me, or any other PC killing one
outright.  It, in the line of thinking of the original poster, denies
the 'newbie' his safety net.

Not at all.  What I, and others of the same thought line, are relying
on is our own skills and abilities.  To give, in my mind, perfectly
valid examples - in roughly the same level range, if not even lower,
is Befallen.  No guards.  Only one zone line.  Gate, run, kill or die.
No option for a guard there.  Same with upper floors of Runnyeye,
Upper Guk, Black Burrow, Unrest, Crushbone,  and a lot of other zones
in the same level range.  To step it up a notch, there are no guards
in Oasis, SRo, SK, Lake Rathetear, LOIO, FM, etc.  

I rely on SoW, Gate, zonelines, and my own abilities to either win or
escape.  If I fail, I die.  Plain and simple.  Even at this stage of
the game.

No.  It is far from the same.  A guard, in most situations, will
outright kill most mobs brought to it, and very quickly.  A zoneline
kills nothing, leaving that aspect of the challenge there.  Using the
WC as a prime example, in many cases, a zone line is closer than the
guards are, and, in some cases, the guard won't help (dervs come to
mind, as do the shadowed men, Gix, and that stupid Dragoon Xytl, who
still gives me headaches at the most unexpected of times)

I am not saying that the person should NOT fight kodiaks, either
regular or small... I am saying that the person should realize that
all bears, as well as most of the other mobs in WC, have a very high
frenzy rate, and a large agro area.  And, as a person learning how to
survive, should develope a strategy OTHER than relying on guards.

Final thought - there is no rule, expressed or implied, that guards,
or any NPC, for that matter, is exempt from getting killed, either by
a PC or a mob.  And, for the greater number of cases, there is always
a good reason for a person to kill a guard, or npc.  Whining about it
serves no purpose, and cussing somebody out because they do it is even
more pointless.
