/agree  The few times I've been unable to find a spell, if I don't want 
to log out and go look it up, I just do a /who, find someone in the 
zone, and send them a polite tell asking them if they aren't too busy, 
may I ask them a question.  If I get no answer I move on, if I do I 
thank them and ask them what I need to know.  A bit harder to find 
tradeskill answers that way ;) but I actually have gotten quite a bit of 
advice by doing an /ooc any <tradeskill>ers in the zone that I can ask a 
quick question of?
