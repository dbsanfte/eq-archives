Uhm...I don't know what you mean, either.  The handset is the handle-shaped
part of a phone that contains the speaker and microphone.  Most wall phones
have a handset.  Unless you are trying to find out if they are using one of
those 1930's wall phones where the handset just had the speaker, and the
microphone was on the case of the phone, your question makes no sense.
