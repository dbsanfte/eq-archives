Demolishing a whole building isn't capturing "terrorist", its more about
making a political point. Apart from scale this really isn't that different
from what happened in New York. Maybe some of the Israeli apologists would
like to explain why it's acceptable in Jenin. Maybe they think it's ok
in New York too...

Most likely the only response will be some waffle about how it's not
terrorism when Israel does it. Sorry not convinced by that kind of 
nonsense, as far as I am concerned demolishing a building full of 
civilians is "terrorism". No matter who does it, no matter what their
sorry excuse is.
