    When chat channels came out, the population of EC on my server dropped
by a sizeable chunk. With The Bazaar, 22 people were in EC last night and
they were all hunting. Nobody who has the choice wants to go to the
haggling, the hitting that auction hotkey over and over, and the waiting to
see if anything you want is available.

    Most of the /auction channel people have items that are high-end, where
the amount of plat being asked may be a barrier to trade and bartering would
be the norm. Those were the people that migrated to /auction from EC on my
server when chat channels came out.

    Yup. There's visible pressure to lower prices, as anybody can do an
EXACT price check on any item for sale in The Bazaar at any time AND can
price out alternatives (some of which they may have not known existed) at
the same time. There's also going to be dumpers - people who want plat fast,
and since they don't need to actually spend time auctioning anymore will
dump stuff for low cost just to get rid of it. I plan on doing that with
some of the junk I have - Hoop of Magi'kot, 40 pp. Goranga Idol, 100 pp.
Just clear them out, because by the next night I'll have another to put on
the vendor!

    What I like is there's now real opportunity for "suppliers" in the
tradeskill industry. I expect the prices of pelts and the like to go up as
people start to compete for every one sold in The Bazaar. I also expect that
people will start selling intermediate products - mana vials, acrylia boning
and studs, leather padding, etc. - far more than in the past. There's now a
one-stop shop where all those tradeskillers will come to look for such
items, and the perceived time savings on them should translate to a
willingness to pay a higher sale price. Heck, I bet an enchanter could sell
enchanted clay!
