Don't forget the level 1 necro locate corpse spell

or if you have a load of cash in the bank (~100pp) to buy a coffin, the
higher level summon corpse spell

Oh, and looking at the original post, he says he doesnt have any corpses in
zone anymore, have you tried /corpse ?
if it says corpse is too far away then it means you do have one, but its not
near you
if it says you dont have a corpse in zone, then it is gone.
