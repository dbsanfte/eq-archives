The standard would be to act in an adult/grown up manner.  Belligerent
turds like Arrowhead (who responded to your post earlier today) would
not be welcome in either my guild or any pick up group I organize.

Right.  Whether or you talking about working at a major IT corporation
or working as a busboy at Denny's, such attitudes will eventually get
that kind of a person fired.

I would sooner take mediocre players who are considerate than skilled
players who are continually rude with bad attitudes.

In my opinion, I think it's possible.  However, I think that is only
possible when the higher level guild officers who started the guild
are RL friends.  When the guild leaders and officers are RL friends
and adults, there is a sense of accountability when you see them at
work the next day.

I think you should start your own guild and set the standards you
would like to see enforced in your guild.
There has to be a good portion of higher level players that would like
to be in a guild that held some standards.
Perhaps it would be a while before you could raid the so-called "uber"
mobs.  Is being in a top guild with a bunch of blowhards worth the
frustration?
