Sounds like you're doing the right thing: research.  Find out guild
rules and priorities, make sure you're a good fit.  It definitely
sounds like a raiding guild is not for you, and those are the ones
that usually follow the equation of guild obligations > all...which
makes complete sense for their purposes.  My guild is definitely of
the friends/family variety, and while we would strongly discourage
anyone from turning off guildchat, they wouldn't get booted if they
did.

Just my 2 cp.
