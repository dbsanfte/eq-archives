Make friends with an enchanter, getting jewelry at cost isn't that bad. The
deal i have is that if she fails on her attempt then I eat the cost of the
materials to make the jewelry.. Pieces you should be wanting to buy are
Sapphire earrings +4 int, +2 str, Sapphire necklace (velium +8 int, +8 str,
or platnium +7 int, +7 str).
Also Sheer Bone Mask +3 int, Polished Bone Bracers +3 int, Wolf fur slippers
no int but 20 mana, Stien of Maggok +10 int, assuming you already have that
necro dagger in range slot.. Braided Cinch Cord for waist slot give +4 int.
You are too low to camp many of these items solo but you can purchase most
of them for 200 pp or less, especially since the GM events gave out such
nice items for int casters.
Good Luck
