I'm looking for armor that a Magician could wear that would have the look
of chain or better when worn.  I'm not all that concerned with the stats. 
I know about the Dark Elf chainmail, and plan on making some when my
smithing skill is high enough.  I also know about Bone Plate legs and
arms.  Are there any other items?  Where do I find them, how much might
they cost?  I know most of them have "crap" stats for a Magician, but I'm
after the look.
