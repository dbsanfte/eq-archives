We had around 100 people doing King Tormax I know you didn't say how many
ppl you had but it was real bad the first time. We also had about half of
the players go LD. The Second time we did him everyone turned off Spell
effects and it went much better. With so many spells going off the effects
will wipe out a raid. With everyone turning the effects off less data is
transmitted sever side is my best guess.
