What senses and uses of the word would that be?  In the 18th and 19th
centuries the US set about acquiring and pacifying an empire.  For the
most part the men driving this made no bones about what it was they
were doing.  It's no accident that New York calls itself "The Empire
State", and has called itself that for a very long time (dunno when
exactly they adopted the nickname officially).  People shy away from
the term nowadays because it has a lot of negative baggage, but those
who led the creation of the empire that became the modern US did not.
And as far as I can tell the same was largely true of the Soviet heirs
to the Russian Empire, at least in the early days.  I wish I had a cite
handy, but one of the most striking things I recall from my reading on
Soviet history is that Stalin supposedly admitted being envious of the
US for having "already pacified their empire", referring to the Union
victory in the Civil War and the successful colonization of the West
and Southwest.  I'm not arguing that the US should be dismembered, by
the way, I think that'd just be stupid.  But, as with the Chinese, we
still look a lot more to me like an empire than a nation-state, too
many regional differences and localized minority factions remain to
make viewing the US as a homogenous culture even vaguely accurate.
To point at an example that you'd think would be long gone, I grew up
hearing lots of "the South's gonna rise again" type comments from
folks who apparently believed it, and that sentiment hasn't died yet
as far as I can see.
