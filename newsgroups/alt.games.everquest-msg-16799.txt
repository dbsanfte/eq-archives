E-mailing (or even better, calling, if not too expensive) customer service is
definitely your play.  You aren't giving them much to go on, but if you still
have your account key number and were using the same name at the time, they may
be able to dredge it up for you.
  If not, your second option is to ask them to issue you a new account key
number, which they sometimes do in the case of people who buy a copy and the key
is already in use. (Happened to me on machine # 2.)
  Failing those options, it looks like your only choice *will* be to buy a new
copy of the game. I know you said that would annoy you if it were the case, but
in all honesty, can you really say that this situation is anyone's fault but
yours? You lose and/or forget all of your information and let the account lie
unused and unpaid for over a period of two years, and you're going to somehow
blame Verant for your not being able to play?  The software isn't that
expensive. Suck it up and go get a new copy.
