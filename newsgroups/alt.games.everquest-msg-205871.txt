I group it all together. If i'm wrong so be it. i'll say i'm sorry
when/if it happens. I understand the idea as i stated how easy XP it
would be. but being the case then we shouldn't be able to drown
either.. We shouldn't hit the water and have our speed rate cut in
half. (and yes my swin is around 200 so don't say it's a skill issue.)
We can also look at things like casting in/out of water. If a mobs is
casting on us and we hit underwater we get nuked. If we cast it the
thing bounces off the water. So i just group it into the same pot
since they never seen to want to go back and repair things that they
had messed up from before for whatever the reason.
