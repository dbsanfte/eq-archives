When I got my Iksar necro to level 8, I bought the Gather Shadows
spell and ran to Shadeweavers Thicket. There's some nice newbie quests
to be done at Shar Vahl, and some nice equipment to be obtained.

When in the Thicket, you can farm Shade silk. The shade silk armor is
quite nice, at least for a low lvl character, and you can pass it on
to a nice monk when you grow out of it. (I reached lvl 29 before
upgrading)

As a side note - Youll be in convenient distance from Paludal Caverns
when in Shadeweavers, should you care to join the fray :o)

Have fun & Good Hunting
