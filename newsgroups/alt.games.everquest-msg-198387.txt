    i pwn u la~

    If I had to guess, I'd say the other cleric didn't want this shared
because it gives a competitive edge, and it cost him quite a bit of time and
cash for Emeralds to test as extensively as he did. I'm more used to an
EQTraders-type environment, where you reveal all you know and reap the
benefits when others do the same, but to each their own. Anyone who thinks
I'm too secretive should do a Google on me some time. ;-)
