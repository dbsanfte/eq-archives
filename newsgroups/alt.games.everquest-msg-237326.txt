	Not my problem -- not my definition.  People who belief in this guy have
spent centuries trying to argue that such a being does exist, and have even
used these self-referentially inconsistent properties as part of their
argument.  (I.E., the various ontological proofs.)

|Hardly. The test for a werewolf would be pretty simple I think. And

	Not talking about the tests -- only the evidence.

	And you'd think an all-powerful, all-knowing, universe-spanning entity
would be pretty hard to hide, too.
