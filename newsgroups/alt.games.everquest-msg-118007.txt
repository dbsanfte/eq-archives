Already expired, in any case.

Unfortunately with the catacombs there are several zone in areas.
I've checked the place where I usually enter.  It may be that I'm in
the wall, which would make it pretty difficult without knowing the
precise loc.  I'm quite sure that I'm looking in the right area.

I've been thinking of starting a bard on AB anyway, for group-only
adventures with a couple of friends (and in a couple of days I shall
have simultaneous access to two machines able to run Everquest with
different accounts).  What sort of level would I need to get to before
I can assist myself?

Level four, if memory serves.  I have a necro on FV.

A few hours after posting here I posted a request to technical support
- it's interesting that "missing corpse" is one of their standard
subject headings.  Hopefully that may result in something, but no
reply as yet.

Thanks for the help.
