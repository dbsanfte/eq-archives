Last night I had a strange encounter in the town portion of FV, and
I'd like to know what happened.  Searching the web yielded nothing.

FYI: I am a 31 high elf cleric playing on Quellious (non-PvP).  To my
knowledge, I have not received any faction hits to FV residents
(everyone I con'd was indiff).

I had just logged into the game and was sitting in front of the bank
in FV.  A lower lvl naked PC spotted me sitting and came up to ask for
a rez.  Suddenly, from out of nowhere, an NPC's pet started attacking
me.  It was hitting me very hard and fast, and looked like an
enchanter's pet (no body, just axe and shield).  After a couple of
seconds of utter confusion, I decided to try to gate to save the death
and figure out what was killing me later.  But gate didn't respond. 
Fortunately, the pet had stopped attacking me, he just stood there
next to me.  Then I realized why.  I was charmed.  Next thing I know,
*I* am attacking the poor little naked PC asking for the rez.  For
some reason, that made the enchanter's pet attack the PC as well, and
the dude asking me for a rez was slaughtered.

The mouse would not move while I was charmed.  Nobody seemed to hear
anything I typed.  After a minute or two of more confusion, the charm
finally broke and the pet proceeded to slaughter me.  At the finishing
blow, I finally got a glimpse of the NPC attacking me, and it
*appeared* to be a fellow high elf in a robe, although I didn't have
much time to look as it was LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.

After the death, I was able to gather that the name of the NPC was
Nadia Starfeast, who was obviously an enchanter NPC.  To add insult to
injury, this enchanter apparently had the skills of a monk, as the
finishing blow was a 152 dmg PUNCH from her (hand to hand by a caster
against a plate wielding lvl 31 char!  ug!).

My bind point was dawnshroud, which made for quite the unpleasant and
long naked corpse run.  And to make matters worse, the next tell I got
was from that poor little naked PC asking me why I killed him.

So I was hoping someone here could help me figure out the following:

(1) Who is Nadia Starfeast?

(2) Why was I KoS to her?

(3) How can I avoid this in the future?  And not just the case in FV -
are there other places I should be mindful of?

As a side note, while I was charmed, I would occasionally cast the
spell in slot #2.  Fortunately, this was a buff, but I thought I read
somewhere that while charmed, you will only cast the one in slot #8. 
What is the rule here?  I have always kept gate memmed on my chars in
slot #8 to avoid exactly what happened last night in FV.
