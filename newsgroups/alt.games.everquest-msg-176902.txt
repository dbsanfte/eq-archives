Heavy Metal: The Black And Silver
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

It's in the whirlpool, where matter vanishes
Degenerate star, arm of Orion
An iron sun, the forbidden circle
It's a mountain, it's a black horizon

Heavy metal, black and silver
Falling matter of the sun
Folds itself into a place
Where there was never, never one

By starlight, the heaviest horizon
Magnetic mirrors, scattered body slow(?)
A chaos of metal, river of fire
Unlighted crossing(?) (the countless) blue and glows(??)

Heavy metal, black and silver
Falling matter of the sun
Folds itself into a place
Where there was never, never one

Falling matter, from the cross
Freedom that was never lost
Beyond the end, we'll be coming
Beyond time, space and control

Direction - sun light
Creation - done right
Foundation - before the Einstein grips the night
Spans a river - star light
Become tired - damn right
World - I love darkness
Without end - and I love light

Heavy metal, black and silver
Falling matter of the sun
Folds itself into a place
Where there was never, never, never, never one
