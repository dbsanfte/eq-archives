Whoever told you that was an idiot. The maximum that a haste item can give
you is 41%. And you only get the benefit of one item, the effects
don't stack. On top of that you add one bard song or one haste spell,
they also don't stack.
There are 2 bard songs in which the haste component also stacks
with spell haste. The Battlecry and Warsong of the Vah Shir I think which
add like 5-15% haste.

The cap before level 50 is 75% I believe. The cap above level
50 is 100% or 105% I believe.

You generally want the highest level haste on the main melee people
anyway because they may be slowed by NPC spellcasters.
