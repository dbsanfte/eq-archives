Um, as of today, the latest post on that second site listed is four
days old. I can't think that qualifies as a good cleric web site. The
first site seems to be decent, albeit a bit sparse.

The best links I know of are still:

http://EverQuest.Allakhazam.com/
http://EQ.CastersRealm.com/
http://www.EverLore.com/
http://www.EQLinks.com/

I would like to see some good cleric-specific links though.
