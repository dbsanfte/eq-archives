You are probably going to have an easier time getting newbie armor than
twinking a 10 lv difference.  I'd just suggest working on that,
unfortunately I hear high elf newbie armor is tough to get, so maybe
not.  Probably the typical newbie stuff is the best way to go.  Kill
spiders, get silks, sell them in the bazaar.   At 14 your cleric can
probably kill willowisps, they can get you as much as 10 pp for a
greater lightstone, you might try that - a good spot is in the sea
between qeynos and erudin.
