Anyone who emerges blinking into the world of EQ will be stony broke for
a good long while. 

Generally, what mobs you are capable of killing initially drop little in
the way money or desirable loot. Most long-term players will wistfully
recall stumbling around Norrath for the first time, scraping together
every copper they could get their hands on. When 5 platinum was a
fortune, and a full suit of banded armour was the very height of
opulence. Unless you decide to merely make money as your goal from the
outset, you will be poor for a large portion of your career. I didn't
feel I was making anywhere near decent money until I was deep into
Cazic-Thule [1], eagerly stuffing every fine steel weapon I could carry
into my backpack.

I must say that melee classes are far, far more dependent on equipment
than the casting classes, and will find themselves spending money
upgrading their equipment as soon as they get it. I'd put forward that
Warriors and Rogues are the most indigent classes, because of the
reliance on their highly coveted equipment and the limited options
available for making the money to buy it all. Casters and spell
capable/special ability characters have an easier time economically, due
to being highly sought after in groups in many cases, and the ability to
do without the flashy sword or the gleaming armour and still be nearly
as effective. That is, if they even need to group at all.

[1] A mid 20s to low-mid 30s dungeon in the Feerrott of the old world.
Mostly deserted save for farmers these days, but great for those who
enjoy frantic fights and want to sharpen (or develop) their
dungeoneering skills.
