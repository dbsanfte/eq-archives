I don't follow the logic. If you can zone in, you are allowed in. If you 
have the firepower to survive in the zone, you are allowed to fight 
there... Whether it's a dungeon or an enemy city, adventuring is 
adventuring.

Now, that's something I could agree with, as long as it's restricted to 
guards.

It would certainly be involved, but not impossible, I think.

Oh, so would Maliciosa purposefully attack one of her own guards to get 
him to follow her?  I don't see the roleplaying there.

Yes, but you have to be *normal* about it. My personal beef is Druids 
killing wolves and bears... If I see that, I would probably give them an 
earful, and probably refuse to help them if they get in trouble, but I'm 
not going to intentionally train more bears on them.

Now, if you are totally incensed by foreigners killing your guards, your 
only in-game and in-character course of action is to level up and kill 
*their* guards. Training them is basically a PvP action, and therefore 
not allowed.

Mental damage goes without saying on anybody who has to learn the layout 
of Neriak...

And you are still wrong.
