Woot! This is nice. Tradeskillers can now collect ore and make it
into things that will stack for later combining and sale.

Cool.

Weird. Must have to be this way to add to the fishing skill.

Wow! How long has that been on their "set in stone and will never change list"?
Seems that "The Vision(tm)" is a little more flexible than we all thought after all.

Well with Luclin a lot of things that Verant has said in the past would
never change, have been added to the game, like wizard pets, horses,
skills that add regen to the melee classes, skills to lower spell fizzle rates,
teleport to west Antonica.

Makes me wonder what's next?

-Player/guild owned houses?
-Melee binding anywhere like casters can?
-Allow religion change?
-Allow Alt-Tabbing out of the program?
-Increase in the number of spell gems beyond 8?
-Recovery of thrown weapons and arrows?
-A use for languages?
-Better pathfinding for mobs?
-Automap?

This game is getting better all the time. The future looks bright for EQ.
