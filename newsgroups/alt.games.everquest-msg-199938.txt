German for super .

First applied to a tank that the germans produced. Had so much armor that it
had to ride on a road at all times or it would sink in the ground and thus
be useless. Was initially applied to certain guilds as a insult since those
guilds where so large that they could not move or act in a reasonable
fashion . Those same guilds overcame the size problem and started to wear
the name with pride. Now its meaning has completely changed :)
