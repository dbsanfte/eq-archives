Yes at later and higher levels the tactics and situations will change. The
druid does have to get up to level 55 to 60 first though and AC only will
not do it for him. At higher levels wis should maxed at 200 so other gear
can be brought into play to help with AC, resists etc. Druids do have self
AC and resist buffs so we are not that weak. Besides druids will always have
low AC as the gear available to us and our base AC is not that high. At
least druids have more than most pure casters.
