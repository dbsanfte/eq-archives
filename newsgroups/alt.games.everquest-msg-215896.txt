I had thought that his comment was in reference to the rezzes, as he 
mentioned the freshly-dead. I never think of KEI as a CR type of thing, 
anyway.

Regardless, the adventurers camps are the best place to spam it, because 
you can cycle through them quickly and (since people are bound there) you 
can probably catch people after they die and before they CR. Plus, people 
are typically there for 15-20 minutes getting a group ready, and can 
remember the service you were peddling and drop you a tell.

My misinterpretation notwithstanding, I still think that the camps are the 
best place to spam it, where "it" = KEI or Rez.
