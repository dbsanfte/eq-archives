You must think I'm an idiot.  Of course I checked that.  My primary is the
staff of the wheel which is one handed.  I also did try to remove that and
just wield the SOTF in the secondary slot.  It just won't go in that slot.
Logically it should go there if there's nothing in primary.  But I suppose
this is just the coders shortcut for saying wizzies can't dual wield.  But
then why list the weapon as wizzy only primary/secondary?  And the right way
to code no dual wield for wizzies is not to disallow an off hand weapon, but
instead just don't allow it to swing.
