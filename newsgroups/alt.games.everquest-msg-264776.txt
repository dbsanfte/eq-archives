My spreadsheet documented every even combine at each level and the cost/sale 
price for each item. I found some pretty nice exploits along the way, which 
I dutifully tested (ahem) and then posted for all to see. Some people 
thought that was a nasty thing to do, but you know what? Each was fixed 
within days of my posting. Tin Arrows, for example, a level 7 even combine 
that could be made using 100% vendor purchased matierals for 104c, and then 
sold back for 170c. A 66c profit on one combine with no farming. WOOT! Heh, 
that didn't last.
