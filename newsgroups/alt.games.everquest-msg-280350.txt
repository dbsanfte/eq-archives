I know this has been discussed here before, but all I could come up with 
was the following quote from http://tinyurl.com/8ta4v...

"Assuming the same exp, when a Human hits level 20, the Troll will already 
be 19. When the Human hits level 60, the Troll will already be 58."

That's exactly what I was wondering, but can anyone confirm this? Is that 
math right? Will the difference between a human at 60 and an iksar with the 
exact same gross xp earned be less than two full levels?
