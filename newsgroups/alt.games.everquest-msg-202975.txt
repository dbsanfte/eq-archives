Sorry it took so long to reply. Had IP issues with the server so
couldn't get or send anything for a while

Well the "rules" are simple.

Start with the old favorite. Freedom of speech.

as stated in ARTICLE 1 of the Constitution.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 

Ok. 1st off. i do agree and accepted getting scolded for shouting at
someone and calling them a dumb fuck when they (after multi shouts i
had a camp.) killed the mob i needed for the quest i was doing. 

  HOWEVER. It is outright bullshit when you use the word crap and get
told about cursing. The government can't stop a guy from useing Fuck
on a jacket. http://www.epic.org/free_speech/cohen.html Yet these self
rightous assholes think they are going to threaten me to kick me off
the game for telling them the truth about how incompitent they are and
calling it exactly as it is.  Bullshit. They can't fix half the crap
(and this is how i put it in the reply to the GM) they screw up with
their BS patchs so they dump a bunch of eyecandy into the game trying
to say they actually did something. (which they did just not useful or
needed.) Shit, Hell, Damn, Etc. are in the dictionary and used daily
by a reasonable majority of people. 

   next we can hit the simple issue or honesty. Not so much a rule as
it is just plain old the way a company is expected to be. they
basically lie about half of the stuff they "fix" refusing (so it would
seem) to test the junk they dump on us. (there by making us be the
beta testers) We ARENOT paying these incompitent retards to test their
stuff. we are paying them to play a game that is expected to work and
be fully functional (relative to what expansion you have.) NOT
download some patch or expansion just to have your PC spit it out like
a cat does a hairball.

To be continued...
