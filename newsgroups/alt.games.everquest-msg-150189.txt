The rule for all research components is this:  They drop in zones
appropriate to the level of the spell, up to level + 5.

If you're level 16 you'll have a chance of looting the words in any zone
appropriate for a 16-21 player.

Quite honestly, though...just shop EVERY NPC vendor you see in any town,
even those not near a 16-21 zone.  Another option is to check the Bazaar
zone for players selling the words.  I don't know how common it is to sell,
but I have sold high level runes that way...maybe others do as well.
