I've heard the phrase "rez effects" used regarding a player who's just
been rezzed by a cleric.  What exactly does that mean?  I keep
picturing it as being something like a person who's just had surgery,
is in the recovery room and waking up from the anesthesia and is still
real groggy and out of it.  Would that be a fair description of "rez
effects"? 

Also, would one have "rez effects" if they just got a Revive (no
experience rez) from a cleric or do rez effects only occur with
experience giving rezzes?

Thanks in advance,
