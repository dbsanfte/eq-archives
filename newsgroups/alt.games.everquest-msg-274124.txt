This is alot like saying the term "bitch" means a female dog.  Sure, maybe 
about 1 in 100 times the word is used.  But, if Bubba comes up and tells you 
he's going to make you his bitch, I sure hope you either have considerable 
size or speed on him.  And, sure, I could say that his usage of the term 
comes from his background in dog breeding, but reality would have to say 
that it's more likely derived from his opinion about women (or societal 
norms within his peer groups to the same effect).
