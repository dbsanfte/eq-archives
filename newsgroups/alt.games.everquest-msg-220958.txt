I started a new char yesterday and just for fun, decided to search for items
100pp and less to outfit him.  I was really surprised about the way prices
had come down and how many people had things way below "market" just looking
for quick turnover.  My shaman went up 10 levels in a really quick time with
only a temp and this eq.

  We got into a little discussion on a chat channel, as another player had
just started a char and was looking for a pl, about the problems incurred in
pl'ing.  My position was that a little "speed up" at the beginning for an
alt wasn't a bad thing.  Say if you went to 30 with assistance, you aren't
really missing much that you couldn't pick up when you start grinding out
the levels.  Matter of fact, my shaman wasn't really even casting during the
battles, just slugging it out like a warrior, because it was just easier to
let temp take care of me.  I'm assuming this is the thinking with starting
at 25 on the test server?

Anywho, I'm convinced the early levels are going to become even more trivial
with the speed that first chars will go through them with cheaper eq, more
available buffs, more opportunities to group, etc...  Especially now that
the social parts of the game seem to be dying out.

Btw, my contribution to the decay of the game is to champion use of a
channel called buffs.  There is hardly anyplace more than 5 minutes away now
and it is really great to hear where the buffers are instead of just going
pok, nexus, bazaar ooc'ing over and over.
