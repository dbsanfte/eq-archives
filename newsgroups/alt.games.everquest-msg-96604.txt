I think they are catering to the cry-babies and the dinks that can't handle
the game.  I could maybe agree with the respawn with all items up to maybe
level 5, but 10 is just stupid.  It teaches them NOTHING.  Now there will be
even MORE people who don't know how to pull/fight well into the 20's.  The
mentality will be to them...well *I* get my stuff back after I die, so who
cares?

As for the Hell levels gone?  BAD BAD BAD IDEA!!!!

I LIKE the hell levels.  took me a little over 2 playing sessions to break
30.  I like them because it filters out the pansies that can't handle it,
and the ones that do stick it out are better for it.  do they suck at times?
Hell yes.  Should they be removed? f*ck no.

What is EQ becoming?

ROMPER ROOM.

Are they going to put foam rummber weapons in instead of Fine Steel next?
Nerf (the soft toy-like nerf...) arrows and such?  Maybe we can all gather
'round and play Hopscotch for experience.

I love you, you love me *immolates Barney*.

Where's the challenge?  What's next?  No racial/faction issues?

Why do they INSIST on "fixing" what isn't broken.

Hell, I remember when you came here asking "What's a good weapon for a
warrior at level 3"? type questions.  look at you now.  we all went through
it, and we all survived.  Screw this SISSY approach.
