Being level 5, you do not have the 14th level Spell, Bind Affinity.  While
other cities, like Freeport and such have Soulbinders, I would stay in
misty Thicket for the pure reason that you can get up to Level 14, get bind
affinity, and bind yourself in WC once you run through Kithicor Forest
during the day.  Crossing WC and EC at level five is not a fun trip, even
for a cleric.  Lots of critters walking about that want to slap you around
or say the famous words 'Get in mah belly!'...  Like Kodiak and Young
Kodiak Bears, not to mention Griffins, HG/Nightshade Giant, and Gix.  Also,
at level 5... You have a 30 minute rot timer for your corpse.  You do NOT
want to die in EC or WC at night, because it will take time for you to get
across Kithicor Forest again and you won't survive running through the
forest at night and you can't wait for dawn, since it takes longer than 30
minutes for Kithicor to be safe to run through again in some cases.
