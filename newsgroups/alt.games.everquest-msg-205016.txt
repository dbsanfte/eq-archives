Any clicky junk buff is nice against dispelling mobs in a raid situation. 
It is also nice against mobs that debuff, as you can bring up the junk buff 
(hopefully a shortlived one) and when it drops, the debuffs can go live in 
the first slot for easy dispelling.

See Invis is a big one on my list.

As a puller, my bracer of hammerfal is handy. As a monk, so is my anizoks 
gauze press. Anything that lets you cast a spell you'd normally cast for 
free is a winner.

And, of course, melees need haste and casters need focus effects. Melees 
like regen and casters like FT(and also regen in the cases of necros and 
shaman).

The various free heals are priceless I believe- I don't have a Velious BP 
yet, but I can imagine they come in very handy.

Other utility items that can be handy are shrinkers (anizoks minimizing 
device) illusion items (masks) SoW potions... The list goes on and on.
