I'm generally putting 90 percent into AA.  that way with any deaths that
happen the 10 percent can cover it and i don't have to change it or play
around with it, its covered.  with few deaths, i get the bonus of having
more insurance in case I have deaths.

When I was below 60th, I would put 10 percent into AA, just to have it
slowlyl being worked on.  In a few levels I got a point into AA, which
helped with running.  Run 3 is definitely worth it, and I know lots of tanks
who work on it because it helps pulling.

When your running from a train, you don't have to be the fastest person,
just not the slowest.
