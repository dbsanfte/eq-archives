I have.  I con'd Dorn a couple levels back at 17 or 18 and he was a risky
blue.  I jumped him the first time and had my halfling butt beat back to
EFP, within an inch of my life.  I thought I'd do the druidic thing and just
snare/DoT him and run all over the desert while it worked on him.

Had to zone.  Came back and caught him pathing back to his camp, so I laid
down another ss on him and the chase was on again.  After zoning back in the
*second* time, he was just above half and I was all but spent in mana trying
to root/snare and DoT him.  Ah well.  I know where he lives...
