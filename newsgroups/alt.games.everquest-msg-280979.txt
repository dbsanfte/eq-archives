And you really see that happening before you can safely reach the door 
in Befallen??

Your comment about wanting to max every skill at every level was equally 
goofy. While I agree its a good idea, I'd wager some of your weapon 
skills are lagging... its nearly impossible to keep them all maxed at 
the low levels. Most people don't start worring about it until the 20s 
or 30s. 

Which is what I'd really recommend to you as well.
