No, it's not just you.  His stupid newsreader is botching the References
header line.  The References line is supposed to look like this:

    References: msg1 msg2 ... msgN

where msgN is the message ID of the message you are replying to, and before
that is the message ID of the message that one is replying to, and so on,
back a reasonable number of messages.

His References line looks like this:

    References: msg1

where msg1 is the message ID of the message that started the thread.  So,
his messages are seen as replies to the message that started the thread,
rather than as replies to the message he is quoting.
