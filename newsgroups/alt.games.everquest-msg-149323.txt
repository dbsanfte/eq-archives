No buff/resist songs when fighting.

That goes for *every* pet class - except maybe chanters, who don't
really have a true pet.

Healing too early. The dang tanks don't need to be at 100% all the
frickin' time. You are nearly always going to be wasting at least a
little mana if you heal a player all the way to 100%.

No damage shields on the MA.

A monk should not be mending when standing anyway. By the same token,
they shouldn't be healed when FD. I agree with the "get outta jail
free card" theory. Mend is to be used as a last resort or to help out
an over-worked cleric unless the pulls are easily manageable.

DoT'ing mobs that the group is dropping faster than the DoT needs to
take full effect.

Drawing aggro when not the MA or SA.

Drawing aggro when not the MA.
Not helping an over-worked cleric out by healing themselves a bit when
possible.
Sitting to med when they are the puller.
 
> Rouge:
> - Not opposing MT

Not using evade.
 
> SK:
> - ??

Drawing aggro if not the MA or SA.
 
> Shaman:
> - Not slowing melee mobs

Stepping on a cleric's heals with their own. Back up healer means keep
a mana reserve but don't heal unless you are called upon to do so.
 
> Warrior:
> - Not taunting before breaking mezz

Leaving a target to pull another mob off a caster when there is a SA
present. The SA should be someone who can draw aggro effectively (SK,
Ranger, Pally, etc.).
 
> Wizzard:
> - Nuking before agro is established

Nuking too late (corpse nuking). The object is to either nuke it just
into run phase, or, if in a high aggro environment, nuke it just early
enough to kill it or make it quick work for the tanks.

Agreed. There are, however, certain cardinal rules to be observed with
respect to whether you are primarily a caster or a melee character and
whether or not  you are acting as the MA.
