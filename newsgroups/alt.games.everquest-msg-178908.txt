: Kei needs a slight mod to it, i see level 3's and 4's running around with

	I've played a few chars from low lvls up; I'm now sick of it.  Three
	casts of KEI allowed me to make a new sham on sunday and get her to
	lvl 20 in 13 hours (47 mage in tow casting dmg shields).

	Lvl 20 isn't anything uber, but at least it's fun where lower lvls
	aren't anymore.  I only get KEI now if I'm the only healer or there
	is no enchanter in the group.  At 24 I'll need KEI even less, group
	or not.

: The lower levels people learn how to play there toons, about mana
: conservering, about there spell lines, and about there skills...  Suddenly
: boom! Unlimited mana for about the 1st 10 levels, guess when they learn
: mana conserveration.... NEVER.

	Or, like 90% of the "n00bs" on EMarr, they are really just alts of
	long time players who, like me, have done the low lvl game a few
	times already and don't see any further entertainment value in it. 
	They know conservation, group tactics, etc, so why bother practicing
	again at low levels?  Get the char upto a decent lvl (a decent lvl
	for me is 20-30, not 50 as some would claim) quickly so you can
	actually have fun with it, that's what I say.

: Soloing it's great but I personaly don't use it, however when I have
: someone port or gate out mid battle because there kei faded and they have
: it in there tiny little brains KEI is a MUST to even cast a spell that is
: going too far! Nercos and Shamen do not need kei due to them getting hp to
: mana convert,

	Pre-lvl 24 shams don't get convert.

: Also Chanters don't need it as much do to there C, and Wizards don't need
: it as much because they can harvest some mana every so often.

	And Mages?  Druids?  Clerics?

: The thing is everyone seems has forgotten how to play there toons without
: that stupid spell. What happens if suddenly they nerf KEI where you have
: to be 46+ for it even to take hold on you? There is gonna be alot of you
: guys that will how no clue what so ever to do, or how to even play your
: toon!
: 
: DARE TO BE DIFFERENT! GO WITHOUT KEI!

	DARE TO HAVE FUN!  PL YOUR ALTS NOW BEFORE THE NURF HAMMER COMES
	DOWN! :-)
