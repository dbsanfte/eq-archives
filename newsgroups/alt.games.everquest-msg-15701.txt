Smithing is a high end skill not really for new player because like Jewelry
it take a good deal of plat spent before you are able to see a return on
your investment. It is possible to loot some of the Items needed like ores
from Lavastorm but by the time you get enough to work with you cant safely
run back to a forge. Also Smithing requires a high Cha for buying and
selling to cut losses to a minimum. But once you get your skill level up
high enough there is profit to be made. Having to books to improve success
rate is a myth I have work in several trade skills with and without the
books with no noticeable difference in success only thing that really counts
is your skill level and the trivia level of the item to be made.
