Short answer, a LOT.  The faction hits in MM are very small compared to the
one from killing a dragon.
You have a few options,
A) Spend many mind numbing hours in an AE group in MM,
B) when fey Low hp charge in and die from enrage (you die = no faction hit),
C) /q right before it dies (this can piss off raid leaders bad), or
D) kill the dwarf king a few times and get max ally.  Sure it ruins dwarf
action, but the positive hit to RoS is amazing.
