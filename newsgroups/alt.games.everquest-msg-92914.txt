I love the things the guards say when they kill creatures.

A few days ago, I was in Gfay and heard a guard say "DIE!!  DIE LIKE THE
FOOL THAT YOU ARE!!"

It had me rolling on the ground practically crying from laughing so hard.
lol

now that I read it, it's not as funny.
but it's still my favorite... so far.
what's yours?
