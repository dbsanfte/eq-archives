Here is some advice, the only thing that should be replacing your
5 ac 55 hp rings are the 6 ac 65 hp rings. Just forget that you have
the stat dex or that it does anything, since more or less it does
nothing. As you get better warrior equipment, some of it will just
have dex on it anyway. Dex only raises the rate at which you might get
a melee skill raise, helps VERY little with proc rate and helps some
with crits. All three of those are pretty dubious claims though,
judging from people with 100 or more dex and yourself.

Even as an ogre, its AC/HP/Stamina pretty much. The stamina is only to
get HP, so you kind of have to figure out which gives more piece by
piece. For example, on my 36 troll sk her crustacean bp with 15 sta
gave more hp (about 30 or 35 I think) than a bp with 20 hp, while a
barbed ringmail with 50 hp gives more than both of course.

In summary, forget dex. Forget agil if your agil is 75 or more.
Concentrate on gear with better AC/HP/Sta. Dex has zero to do with
hitting. Your weapon skills and offense skill make your "to hit." Even
with 73 dex at the levels you are (48 I think) you will max weapon
skills soon after leveling anyway.
