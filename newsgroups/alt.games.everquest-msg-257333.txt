Very much beginner level... Screenshot manipulation, I've done a few
dolls, I do some pencil drawing now and then, but not much is
scanned.. Made a few sigs out of screenshot manips.

Of course, a lot of people debate that screenshot manip isn't really
art. :/ And I can't get the lovely hair and effects some people can do
yet. I'm trying to learn, but makes it hard when I let myself get
discouraged so easily.
