Well, decided to follow along and download / try out AO before the
offer closes.  Now that someone else has shown the way, like the
lemming I am...

Went to AO, followed the link to download.

Went to Gamespot to do the download.  Need DLX membership.

Went to MSN to get Hotmail account.  Need .Net membership.

Got .Net membership

Got Hotmail membership

Got DLX membership

Spent a fair while trying to convince Hotmail to show me the reg
confirmation.  Finally got it.

Back to DLX, found the AO download again, started it off.

This is where it got different from what was described.  I didn't (or
at least haven't yet had to) install any sort of sharing program; it
just started dumping an 816 MB file on me
(AOInstall15.7.3_EP0_live_nointro.zip).

The question therefore is, did I miss a step?  Or have they perchance
changed the method?
