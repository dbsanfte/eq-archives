wow so much confusion in one place.

With the recent melee changes, the stamina bar is now called the Endurance
bar.  It is like the mana bar for melee disciplines.

This should not affect you at all.  There is no reason for you to even try
to get back lost stamina, as the only effects of being out of stamina (or
endurance now heh heh) for a cleric are not being able to jump, and if your
STA stat is below 100, a slight attack speed reduction.

What splendid meant by ultravision replacing sta effects was that many items
that had the 'invigorate' click effect have had it replaced with Ultravision
(worn), to reduce endurance regeneration by melee classes.

I don't get what you mean about 'using your EB ring'.... having eb effect on
you does not deplete your stamina.... SWIMMING depletes your stamina.

I've never heard of an empty stamina bar having any effect on medding/mana
regen either...

anyway.. if you're worried about being low sta... just sit down for a few
seconds and it'll be back... don't waste mana to replace it (the reason to
use Yaulp V is for the mana regen, not the sta regen ;)
