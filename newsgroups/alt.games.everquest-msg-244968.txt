Getting skillups against pets works...or at least, it used to.  A few
months ago I (a Beastlord) dueled a Shaman friend of mine so she could
get her Defense and some of her weapon skills up, and she got about 10
points in everything she needed over 30 minutes while fighting my pet.
 Recently, I finally got the Diamond Prism of Companionship from the
North Ro LDoN camp...which dramatically increases pet regeneration
when not fighting, among other awesome things.  I had another
Beastlord guildmate who wanted to get one of his skills up, so I put
my pet on /pet hold and let him whack away at it.  After 10 minutes he
didn't get a skillup, and my pet was dark blue to him.  So, either he
got very unlucky or this was changed at some point.  Probably a good
thing, as we could basically go AFK while this was going on, with the
correct positioning.  Or there could be some kind of cap on how high
you can get your skills in this manner.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
