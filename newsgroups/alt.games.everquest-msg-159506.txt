I post stories in a newsgroup and have had quite a few of them stolen.  And
liker your situation, I offer them for free on usenet or a few websites only
to have some smarmy weasel (who usually doesn't even bother to change a few
names around to at least make it look like the ass actually did some work)
steal them and charge money.

First thing to do is notify their host.  Even if they aren't selling them
directly through the host, they are using that isp as a contact.  Second
thing is to send a cease and desist letter.  If you need one, I had my
cousin write up a boiler plate for me, I will gladly send you a copy.  Also
send a cease and desist to both Ebay and the host.  If your work is
copyrighted with a date, it is yours (assuming yours (in the general sense,
not Lokari, wasn't taken from someone else), no ifs, ands, or buts.

Fight it, and fight mean.  Unfortunately not a lot of people think that they
can do anything about it, but they are wrong and it's those who don't do
anything that make it easier for the next guy to come along and rip off
someone else who did the work/research and spent the time coming up with
original work.
