Great two second scene in "Patriot Games" (the book, the movie dropped all
of the good stuff) where Jack (er Sir John) Ryan is on a naval launch in the
midst of a running gunfight.  In between moments of actual battle, the Cheif
Range Officer (and small arms instructor) at annapolis puts his hand on
Jack's shoulder, pulls the pistol out of Jack's pants, lets the hammer down
slowly, and puts the pistol back.  Then he says something about Jack's
impending newborn having siblings (don't remember the exact line).
