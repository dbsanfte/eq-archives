Hm, I see your point.  I guess I don't have a good feel for how many
LDoNs you'd have to do to get the augment-plus-some-crappy-charm to
be as good as the Tutorial charm.  (Haven't done much LDoN myself.)
I was thinking that you wouldn't have to LDoN quite that much to get
something good enough to replace the charm.  And then I looked at it
from the point of view of established characters, who can never get
the charm; if their LDoN augments are good enough, they can't really
feel too bad about not having access to the tutorial charm, since the
two don't combine anyway.
