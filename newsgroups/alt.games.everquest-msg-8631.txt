That's probably true.  I was grouped with a bunch of people, and
one of the guys suggested going over to sit outside the Sarnak Fort.
Since this is my first character and I don't know any better, I
went along.

Yeah, I suppose these will be the "good ole days" when I get up that
high :^)

We didn't actually go inside the fort yet.  I was 18 at the time,
bordering on 19.  Pretty low-level for that area, I guess, from your
comment...

hmmmm.... good suggestions.  That's one thing I didn't like about LOIO
is how far the zone borders were if I needed them (which I did!)  I
don't take a whole lot of risks in this game since dying irritates me
so much, so I tend to run to the zone fairly often...

I'll dig-up my maps and see how to head to those areas you suggested.

Thanks for the tips!

Mike
