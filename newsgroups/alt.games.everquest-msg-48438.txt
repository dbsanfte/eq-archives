>Satellite still uses phone lines for the uplink connection

This is an un-true statement. I've done much research and
bi-directional Satellite is common now. Latency will be the killer for
EQ though. You can get Bi-directional Satellite AND Direct TV service
with the SAME dish for about $100.00us. per month. That's about the
same as a broadband connection and cable tv.


Every man has a right to utter what he thinks truth, 
and every other man has a right to knock him 
down for it. Martyrdom is the test.

Samuel Johnson (1709-84)
