Yes, as a matter of fact.

Simply because most of the people who were worth grouping with
have been driven away from the game by SOE's mass bug factory and
bad customer service that getting a group worth the time and
effort takes a long time.

I get more xp going direct into solo play rather than spending 3
hours of my 4 available hours trying to find a decent group with
people who actually know what they are doing.
