When the bazaar first opened the price of tradeskill items (especially
Tailoring) were outrageously high. Some people were selling Leather Padding
for as high as 50pp ea.  Spider Silks and Silk Swatches were 10pp to 25pp
ea. respectively. I couldn't believe it.  Competition for spiders was almost
as high as giants in Rathe Mountains.  Things have settled down a bit, but
some of the tradeskill components are still a good way to make a steady
amount of money.
