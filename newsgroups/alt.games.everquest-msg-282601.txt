Regardless of the target, intent or size of the raid force the key to good,
fun and successful raids is clear, targeted unambiguous communication at
all times, about everything.

The second most important thing, which is directly related to
communication, is a clear understanding of the 'rewards' of the raid and
how they are to be handled, even if that is 'no reward other than fun'.
