Just because it is a last resort does not make it
irrational.

What if he didn't know exactly what was causing
his depression. In that case, it would be
irrational for him to give up playing, wouldn't
it?

Suicide isn't at the bottom of the list,
continuing to exist is surely below that.

Again, how does suicide = irrational choice?

Its not always about suffering.

I have given 4 examples, 2 fictional and 2 from
real life.

Obviously, I don't. That is the point I am arguing

See, now you are starting to find exceptions to
your notion that suicide is an irrational
decision.

You don't really have to be a fan, it is fairly
well known. I am sure you would have heard it
before, it is the one that starts;

"To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them?
To die: to sleep;	No more; "

The full text is here;

How are all other options exhausted in the case of
seppuku?

Suicide isn't always a means used to end
suffering. It has been used for other purposes.

How do you know all other options were not

So the difference is; 
if it is your profession, you get compensation, if
it is a hobby, you don't?

I'm not too keen on analogies. In this case, all
facts are known.

Which part of the story does your question about
rationality refer to?

>Cigarettes are addictive due to Nicotine, a physical chemical substance. 
>EQ is addictive because it is fun. Should every company or individual

Maybe they should. How could it hurt?

Especially if it could be proved that the fun can
be detrimental to your health.

It didn't get the name Evercrack for nothing.

Isn't that how it works already, if the defendant
files a motion for summary judgment?

The plaintiff and defendant come before a judge,
who decides on whether the case has sufficient
merit to go before a jury.

If it does go before a jury, the judge can
overturn or reduce any compensation,
notwithstanding the jury's decision.
