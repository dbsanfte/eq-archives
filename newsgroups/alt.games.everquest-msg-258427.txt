Google can likely get you all the answers...

Sleeper was just part of a script.  The intent was for people to kill 
four warders which awakens the sleeper.  He then kills everyone in the 
zone, and in several other zones, and is gone forever.  He has no loot 
table, he has boatloads of hitpoints, and an insane regen (I believe).  
It took a whole boatload of people zerging him, with lots of battle 
rezes, to finally kill him, on Tallon Zek I believe.
