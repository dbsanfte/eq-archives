I don't have a set target.  No reason to impose such arbitrary constraints,
as being flexible will win more fights.

Better?  No.  It's *very* simple.  I've answered it a dozen times.

Safer?  Sure, you're ready for a wipe situation on every pull.  I, on the
other hand, am aware that the wipe situations that are totally unpredictable
are few and very far between.

I don't sit around.  I'll say that another thirty times if that's what it
takes for you to actually read it.  :P

"You agree"!

I don't agree.  Are you so incredibly dense that you think by repeating "you
agree" over and over that I'll suddenly come to the realization that I
should have been waiting til my cleric was ready for armageddon between
every pull in spite of the fact that experience tells me otherwise?

"You agree"!

Sure, I can sum it up quite simply and have multiple times.  Why wait for
the cleric to be ready for armageddon when I already know the next mob is
gonna be a single?  What possible purpose would that serve other than
coddling slow or timid (take your pick) players?

Actually, I could duo the place.  I couldn't win with a duo, but that's a
DPS issue.

> and B) is really a pretty trivial advantage

How would you know?  Well, other than your odd assumption that by waiting
*anytime* your cleric finishes a fight below 80% that you will somehow
manage to keep up with the pulls of somebody who will pull with the cleric
at 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30 and probably even 20 understanding that the mana
will keep flowing in.

The mana comes the entire time.  If I pull at 30% and the cleric finishes
the next fight at 35%, I'm not going to tell him to drain off 5% mana.  If I
then pull at 35% and the cleric finishes at 40%, again I'm not going to tell
him to drain off mana.  The concept of me pulling faster on average comes
when you have more than one fight that takes a chunk of mana during the course
of a dungeon.  If my cleric has gotten up to 50% through easier fights and
drops 20% to 30% on a tougher fight, I pull again immediately.  You wait. 
If that happens later in the dungeon, again, I pull again immediately.  You
wait.  How can you not see that I will pull faster on average as well as
just the first pull?  :P
