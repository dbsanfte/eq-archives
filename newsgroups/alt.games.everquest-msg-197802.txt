Hmmm.... 7 1/2 hours plus and still down!  Not that the shit birds at Sony
give a crap but:
WENT AND BOUGHT SHADOWBANE this morning!  FU sony!  Stick your endless
patching shit up your ass!
This game ROCKS and its UP and RUNNING... a lot more than ANYONE can say
about your crap!  Two years of Sonys patch bullshit are at an END and thank
God!

Keep up the rotten work guys... you all suck at EQ but you can't help that a
greedy corp. hires second rate ppls now can you!  Now to keep trying to get
through to Sony-shit-eaters-Inc 'customer NO service' and cancel both
accounts before I have to go back to work in 3 days!!!
