Not to get into too much of a religious discussion...  but even the Jews
think that Jesus was killed by the Jews.   =P

I hear Julius Caeser was killed by Romans (which makes little sense as
Julius Caeser was apparently Roman himself)...   yeah, that's not the
strongest argument anyone has ever made.   =)

If it offends your religious sensibilities that much, take it as the obvious
religious omen that it is and stay the hell out.  Obviously your deity of
choice does not want you to vote.   =)

You are free to adhere to your belief, and not exercise your right to vote. 
I think most everyone will respect that...  well, of those that actually
