Venril Sathir is open to anyone with an Everquest account, only the
localized servers require the New Dawn package. And did they really
ever promise no transfers for Kael Drakkal and Sebilis? That's not how
I understood it, though as I only played on VS I didn't follow that
very closely.

But in any case, those servers are run by UBI Soft, this server will
be run by SOE. UBI probably gets more money the more people who play
on their servers, while Sony gets not a cent extra from people playing
on the new server instead of one of their old servers (ignoring
transfer fees).

You mean I can play on Kael Drakkal and Sebilis now, without New Dawn?
