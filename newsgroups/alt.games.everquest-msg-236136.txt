Max out hide every level.   Thats the only one you *really* need to work on.
(for evade)

At 11 skill you can pick the befallen door, the easiest one I'm aware of.
Do that until you skill up enough for other doors.  (or just all the way to
max.(for your level))

I never really saw the reasoning behind working safe fall.   If you're
running around and you don't need it, it doesn't hurt you to not have it.
If you're running around and taking damage from falls... then you're getting
skill up opportunities without "working at it".   So it's not maxed out
instantly each level... so what?    The times that an extra 2 damage from
going over a bump at SoW speed will make any difference at all are almost
non-existant.

I wouldn't even ask in a group.  Just plain don't do it unless you are
soloing or master looter (meaning you'll be splitting all cash at the end of
the adventure / group).    Don't be a jackass and screw your group.   Rogues
have enough trouble grouping just because of the stupid implementation of
this skill.

Hide is all you need to do to evade.  (make sure attack is off when you hit
the button.)   Sneak in this situation does not have any positive effect.

And if your'e going to hotkey it and use this setup... you'd have to make
sure hide skill is in "button 1".   Although it would probably be amusing
the first time you got aggro, hit your evade button, and got the response
"You do not sense any traps." while the mob beat the snot out of you. ; )

> You are then basicly invisable ..with a very slow move rate.

The slow movement while sneaking improves at 50+  By 60 you can sneak at
full speed.

You can also evade before you have aggro, to prevent it from happening.

This is incorrect.   You want a high damage piercer more than you want a
fast one.  (although almost all rogue piercers are fast so it's not really
an issue.).  Since a great deal of your damage comes from backstab, and
backstab is based on weapon base damage, not speed...  Rogue is the only
class for which a bigger and slower weapon of equal  ratio (damage / delay)
does more overall damage in the main hand.

For your offhand, you want to keep both one hand slashing and one hand blunt
as close to max as you can.   (once you have dual wield.)   Don't worry if
you fall behind in the early levels, you'll have plenty of time to catch up
later, just stick with it.   Don't fall into the trap of only using piercing
to level 50+


Oh.. and Vengence is your friend.   Any item with that on it, you want : )
