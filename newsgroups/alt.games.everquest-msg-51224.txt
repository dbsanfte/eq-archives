Minor problems?

Soon enough he'll hardly ever be in a group without an enchanter...
weapons that break mez are enough to get you kicked out of
enchanter groups in a hurry.

If he's going to insist on playing to 60 without mez, he's in for
a very long uphill battle... as if 50 to 60 isn't uphill both ways
to begin with.
