IMC there are no sorcerers. I didn't like how they were just thrown in
willy nilly in 3ed.

Now that's just fine for me, but some people absolutely positively
hate hate hate hate hate memorizing specific spells and want to cast
spontaneously.

So I had an idea, tell me how balanced this is. With sorcerers nixed,
I might allow wizards to cast any spell in their spellbook, FROM their
spellbook (literally), without preparing it first, at the cost of cast
time doubled and spell takes away a spell slot from one higher level.
Also, the spellbook must be in hands (no other equipment readied).

I think this is balanced, but I want to know what you think. Or any
suggestions you might have....
