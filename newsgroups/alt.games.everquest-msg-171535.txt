One mild objection... Bard mana stacks with KEI and any other clarity.  In fact, the level 20
bard song type (pulse mana) will even stack with another bard singing the same song, only the
HP/mana regen line does not stack with another bard on same line.

The reason this is a mild objection is that if all you wanted a bard for was mana regen, his
tiny additional supply would still pale alongside the awesom power of KEI, and your casters
might well not require that additional boost at low levels; a full mana bar is a full mana
bar, after all.
