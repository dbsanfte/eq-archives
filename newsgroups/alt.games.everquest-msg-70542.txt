Wow Dan, where did that come from?  He is pleased that he has a reasonable
remedy for the problems that I presume he has had playing after the upgrades
that were specifically not supposed to require him to upgrade his OS.  I

as a principal thing with him, perhaps I'm wrong, not a matter of hating EQ
or Verant.
