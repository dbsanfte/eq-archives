Dont waste time farming, level up, cash will come if you quit spending it in
the bazaar, spend a whole day trying to get 100pp or wotever an hour? No
thanks, think I will fight, get exp and loot, and sell everything I have
foraged...

I fell into the trap you may be falling into now, just rememeber, level >
all, plat wont help you kill a level 45 and take his loot mob as 34, but
exping to 44 will let you do this....

After around 46-47 I noticed a significant jump in the amount of plat I can
bring in, without much effort.

I curse the time I spent at the aqua goblin camps pre-nerf (maybe 20hours
total time farming greens...), I was new at the time, and still am I
suppose, but I would much rather of spent those 20hours going up 4-8 levels
or whatever could be managed in that time, than just getting plat which
would serve no really important purpose anyway, for the small amount coming
in at those levels (and you dont really need anything 'good' at low levels
anyway, you just think you do :) ).

My bros untwinked druid was a higher level than my main, and bringin in more
cash, when I took a break from EQ to play planetside, he got a druid to 46
and was making crazy money compared to what we had been.

Either way, its your choice, just offering my experiences with plat farming.
