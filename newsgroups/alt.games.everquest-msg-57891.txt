Hmm at 26 ad haf elf my stats are slightly different but in the same range
(I beleibe my STA is higher with losses in dex and a bit in AGI).

Work those dual and double skills like crazy....go and solo a load of
light blues. Me at 26 is sittin on about 135 in each and they are vital
for th extra damage per time to go up...particularly as the mobs get
harder.

I know the feeling, believe me. Can I ask why you are fletching quite as
much as you give the impression....Now I have a Trueshot I think Im likely
not to fletch except as a past time or to fuel the low levellers for bows.

I'd suggest getting to Runnyeye asap and beating on gobbos. They drop
blackened alloy armour and weapons that untwinked should be in the range
that you can a) use and b) sell for quantities of plat that make you
happy. The blackened alloy longsword is a good weap from Runnyeye that you
should be able to get (the mob was yellow to me as I watched the 52 lvl
monk gank it), either by killing yourself or having a farmer hand an
excess one over (its lore).

I currently use the PGT, but the claws you use seem very poor....I think
my velium battle axe had stats of that order, and that ad a proc on it
(they weigh in at about 20 plat)
