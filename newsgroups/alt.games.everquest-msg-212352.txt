Ahhhh, there's the rub.  According to Genesis, the knowledge of good and
evil wasn't suppossed to be given to man.  It was supposed to be hidden from
man.  Only after the serpent incident in Genesis 3 did mankind understand
the difference between good and evil.

Was this part of the "master plan"?  Don't know about that.  But again
according to Genesis 3, we still don't know about the whole "Tree of Life"
thing, so it would seem that some subterfuge is afoot.
