Well, spreading us out would make it better for levels where the
crowding in the "good" zones is intense, if you play in the evening hours.
Say Karnors Castle, Velketor's Labyrinth, Oasis, Crushbone... zones where
you see 50% of the people around your level crammed in together trying
to find a hunting spot, while a dozen other good spots with mobs the
same level are so empty that as you note finding a group may be impossible.

I'd never have been able to do Kurns Tower if I'd needed a full group for
the zone, solo there was happy indeed as there were rarely more than
one or two other solo-ers taking the teen level mobs, a couple high
levels camping the jester, but that didn't interfere.

If people spread out more, then you'd see less overcrowding in the
currently popular zones, and would see more chance of getting a
group in the other zones your level.  This would mean that instead
of your Everquest career consisting mainly of about 10 zones from
1 to 60, you'd get full use of the what, 60+ zones out there?

You'll appreciate this idea even more on your second, third, fourth
character, when the very idea of "Overthere -again-" gives you
the shudders.
