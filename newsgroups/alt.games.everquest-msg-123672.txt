how about this one, I'm in the NK spires waitting on group to come down,
they arrive safely and so I begin to cast my port spell to somewhere (I
forgot destination or why we all gathered in one place but back to the
story), just after I cast my spell the norrath spires casts its spell, my
spell being a shorter casting time went off first, but guess where we all
endded up? nexxus of course
