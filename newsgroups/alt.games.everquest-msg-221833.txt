Yep, and although SK using an item so powerful it was nerfed to
no longer drop in the game can make excellent use of this, other
classes can use this feature as well.  Any invis will work, it
doesn't -have- to be insta click... if you can arrange to aggro a
mob and still have time to invis yourself before he gets to you,
say by rooting it in place, then you can waltz past any number of
mobs that can't see you and they won't add even though their
buddy is hot on your tail.  High level rogues (who don't suffer
massive movement penalties) are arguably better at this than any
SK, since their invis works on live and dead alike.

Even a level one warrior could use this trick, though, by use of
Cloudy Potions, which are insta click one shot invis potions.
