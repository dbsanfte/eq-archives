Oh, excellent.  They must have updated that recently, because I was
there no more than a couple of weeks ago and at that time they
still had only the pre-50 skill caps.

They still need to fix the entry for Lay Hands though, which they
show as having a skill cap of "200".  This doesn't make sense, since
Lay Hands is an innate ability that does not rely on skill points
(nor is there any way to practice it better).  Its "strength" relies
entirely on level, period.
