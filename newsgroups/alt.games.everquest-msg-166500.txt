But you're missing the point.  This gives them a rationalization that
they actually truly _believe_.  The most common refrain to justify the
naming policy was that stupid, vulgar names disrupted the roleplaying
environment, and with the implementation of Firiona Vie, there are a
lot of people who come up with those names who feel that there's _no_
roleplaying environment to disrupt.  They just tell the person who
takes exception to Poopooskidmarks Uranus to "take your pathetic
nerdboy roleplaying fetish to a roleplay server."  This didn't exist
before FV came into being.

I think that deep down, people like Poopooskidmarks Uranus knew before
FV that there was no validity to their protests, but after FV I'm not
so sure.

I do know that there's no longer any acceptance of the notion that EQ
servers are supposed to be roleplaying servers after FV came up.  You
have to justify the naming policy on other grounds to these people.
