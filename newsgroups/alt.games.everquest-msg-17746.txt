The druid in your group in PAW exclaims "I'm scared" and Gates all the way
back to OT in mid fight...but wait...it gets better...

He then comes back and says "I'm just gonna sit at the zone line and soak up
the exp...you guys don't mind do you?"

Druid has been removed from the group.
Group Leader says: You are the weakest link...goodbye!

No lie...this really happened.
