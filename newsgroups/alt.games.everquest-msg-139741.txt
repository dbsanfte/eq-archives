In my experience the raid is over once she get the CH off its like the
complete heal also has an Aegloism and regen attached to it. When I have
been on successful raids on Vox the tactic was to have 2 or 3 Clerics
alternate CHs the main tank, and the rest of the Clerics and Enchanters Stun
all the pets have Gnoll hide lariats, and Tanks hit with stunning weapons if
they have good ones. After 2 bubs of health have been taken, the Cleric and
Chanters start chain stunning. This seems to work the best by the raids I
have seen
