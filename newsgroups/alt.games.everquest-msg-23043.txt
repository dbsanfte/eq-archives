Maybe you should have followed up to that post instead of the one where
it was snipped out, then...

I quoted enough to follow what the thread was talking about at the time.
I'm sorry I don't tend to quote the entire previous contents of the
whole thread I am responding to every time I post to in case someone
wants to address something I'm not even talking about...

For some reason, I choose to only quote enough from the previous post
for people to be able to follow what I'm talking about when I post a
followup. Oh yes, maybe it's because that's common practice on Usenet. 

I'm not trying to 'cop an attitude', just pointing out that it's very
hard to follow threads when people start answering the question before
last. I only knew what you were talking about because I'd read the
earlier post, but if someone came into the thread late and the original
message had expired on their server, they wouldn't know what the hell
you were on about. If you're going to respond to an earlier article when
the thread has moved on you should make some reference to it by either:

a) following up the right post in the first place

b) saying something like 'the original poster said' and quoting the
relevant bit

c) saying something like 'it's expired in my newsreader, so I'm
following up to this post instead, but the original poster said' and
then paraphrasing.
