It's valid because you were attacking the process of how I asked a
question. If you want to talk about grammar and such, yours can come
into question as well.

You weren't helpful at all.

You first.

My oldest is 20. And no, from what I gather, I'm not older then you.

You sure are a bitch for being a mature person. Then again, no one
said you were mature either.

You in particular are insulting.

Again, you first.

Polite? I don't think you'd know manners if they came up and slapped
you upside the face.

>and don't be a bitch

Elders first.

Published twice in a cheap magazine that they require payment from the
authors does not make you an author. Once you die and your books are
considered curriculum in schools, then I will kneel at your grave and
pour out my apologies. Hell, I'll even bring your favorite flowers.

Indeed. Much more helpful then *most* people here.
