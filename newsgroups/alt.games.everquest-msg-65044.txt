I checked out EQ tonight with the current installation. (everything
upgraded but the new video cards, which only arrived today.) I had set
up EQ to show most of the new character models, since I had 512 MB RAM
and knew my new card was on the way. Near the NK portal the video lag
was so bad it was unplayable. Ah well... no biggie. I'll just slap in
the new card. I had ordered an Appollo Geforce 2 MX 400 (64 MB) for both
machines. I opened the box. I opened the computer. The card inside has a
connector that comes out at the *TOP* of the card, feeding into a little
silver connector box where the video cable plugs in. The cards have a
connector that comes out at the bottom. (Where the audio cables currenly
plug in for my machine.) The card appears to be completely incompatible,
even though they are both AGP adaptor type cards, not the ones that plug
into the white PCI slots on the riser.

Has IBM fucked me again? Is this some proprietary hardware bullshit
again? Off to open up the Gateway machine where I"m sure one of these
new cards will fit marvelously. Any input appreciated.

*sigh*. I guess when I log myself in later I'll just look for the option
to turn off all the new models and see if it becomes playable.
