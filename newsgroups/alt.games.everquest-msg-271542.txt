Further, although Berserkers don't have a Taunt button, they taunt much 
better than warriors well up into the low 50s; Stun is an excellent 
taunt, and snare isn't bad either, plus the significantly better damage 
output of a berserker lends even more taunting power.

The tool you'll notice Berserkers have regarding aggro isn't a taunt 
button, its a aggro loss effect; similar to the Jolt that rangers get in 
the low 50s, berserkers can deliberately reduce their aggro to let those 
better suited to tanking take it, if needed.

Personally, I found I didn't mind tanking at all into the 50s as a 
'Zerker, using stun axes as a slow or supplement to slow meant the 
incoming damage wasn't at all bad, and I never had a healer complain 
about me being too expensive to heal.

In the 50s, damage ramps up incredibly, and you start to see a lot of 
stun immune mobs, suddenly aggro reduction starts to look very very nice.

I think in general that the OP will find the berserker an excellent 
class to solo, not much more to learn than there is about the warrior, 
but with the key utilities of snare and stun there's a -lot- more you 
can do with them, solo or in small groups.  Since he's not planning on 
going up into the real high end of the game, he won't ever hit the "wow, 
I was a god and now I'm crap" problem that the class reaches at around 55.

Course if he -does- change his mind and go for 70, he'll curse the day 
he ever changed to Berserker, unless by then they've fixed the high end 
of the class...
