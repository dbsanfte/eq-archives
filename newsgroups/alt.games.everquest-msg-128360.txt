Hell, I remember when removable disks were large contraptions
consisting of plastic shells over four stacked aluminum
hard disk platters a bit bigger than vinyl record albums,
with a thick metal spindle running down the center and
a suitcase-style handle on top.  You'd drop it into a
cabinet the dimensions of an apartment-sized washing
machine, twist the handle to lock it in, and then
close the lid which would raise the shell and allow
the heads (which were part of the cabinet) to slide
in and read the disks.

They weighed about 15 pounds each, and looked like
the dinosaur on the far upper left of this page:

And they held so little information (although they
were considered "high capacity" at the time) that we
had to manually swap disk packs in the middle of 
each FORTRAN compile.

When I saw my first 8" floppy, it was high-tech
state of the art.
