Forget soloing.  What level could a Highelf Cleric and Ogre Warrior in full crafted
take one down?  

Teapray  <--- scared to try it until at least level 29 when she gets 
              her new spells.

My main on Firiona Vie:

By the side of Lenny, the Traveling Ogre Warrior.
Members of the Council of Mithril Dreams.
Teapray  -- High Elf Cleric, 26, everyday is a new adventure!

Several others played on Drinal, highest is a level 30 Ranger.
