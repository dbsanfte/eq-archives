You are patently wrong.  Copyright can be diluted in much the same way as
trademarks, and particularly with this example where a HUGE concern is
"getting away with it" a court would undoubtedly take that into
consideration were Sony to go after an individual.  Notice the actual
wording I used, "devaluation".  That was important.

But of course they never will, because there is *no* copyright violation
occurring.  None at all.  Nobody is copying anything.  What is being
"distributed" *remains* in the possession of Sony.  There *is* a reason
why Sony has never filed such a suit, and it's because their lawyers are
smarter than that.  Thus the "surrender the claim" part of what you quoted
above (not "surrender the copyright", but maybe I should use simpler
sentence structure for you).  They'd rather be able to threaten and have
some people believe that there is some sort of "legal" reason they shouldn't
do it, than to actually go to court and have a judge rule that there's no
such thing.

But I'm glad you realize that copyrights aren't trademarks.  Coincidentally,
so does Sony, and they enforce their trademarks religiously.  Just as I'm
sure they would enforce their copyrights, if and when one is ever infringed
upon.
