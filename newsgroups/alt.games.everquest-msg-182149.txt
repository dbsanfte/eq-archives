    Jazz, they broke their word to us. How would you expect us to react to
that?

    The stuff on boards other than our server board wasn't posted by us. At
least in the case of Graffe's, it was posted by someone on another server
who had heard about it and thought it was another of those "open raid" deals
like the ones on Drinal. I can see why he'd be amazed, considering that
"open raid" would have been within two kills of the same level FoH is at.

    The stuff on the Quellious board was all us. Lots of bitterness there.

    What part of "they suggested some of the terms, and we came to an
agreement" don't you get? I asked Martin, I'll ask you: what do YOU think my
guild should have done when two guilds came to us and said "stop killing
that thing you kill, we want it"?
