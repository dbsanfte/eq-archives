Current line-up

Warriors
lvl 22 Dorf (Str/Sta/AC... was aiming for a 'real' tank)
lvl 23 Half Elf (high Dex, proccing experiment)
lvl 19 Barb (2HSlash + Slam experiment)

Mages
lvl 24 Erud (int twink from way back)
lvl 10 High Elf (if I can be bothered to spend the time, I'll level to the
point where I can group both mages on 2 PCs... just to see if I can handle 2
pets at once)

Monks
lvl 57 Iksar (I wanted at least ONE char where I could actually start
working on AAExp) :o)
lvl 32 Human (old self-PLing experiment)

SKs
lvl 18 DE (I wanted a full set of Neriak Newbie Quest armour for her,
because it looks good... never completed because 2 parts refuse to drop...
and yes, she reached 18 without ever leving Nektulous, I killed THAT many
skells in the Ultricle!!)
lvl 15 Iksar (wanted to see how fast I could solo over a weekend, so picked
a tough race/class/xp combo... abandoned but not deleted yet)

Clerics
lvl 22 Dwarf (abandoned... very early char, picked Str over Wis, trying for
a Soloable Cleric... won't ever delete this guy, he's based on a D+D char I
used to run in Highschool)
lvl 15 High Elf (will never pass 20 with this guy... he's strictly for
Tradeskills, Smithing 190... will hopefully GM in this skill)

Also running... when I'm

lvl 25 Ranger (fletch 203)... 3rd attempt
lvl 13 Rogue... 3rd attempt
lvl 10 Shaman... 2nd attempt
lvl 12 Enchanter... 4th attempt
lvl 10 Wizard... 2nd attempt
3 Necros, all deleted... will certainly try another, prolly a Gnome, next
time

Classes I haven't tried more than once...

lvl 45 WE Druid... happy with this guy, and he's currently working on
tailoring (will GM this guy)
lvl 12 HalfElf Bard... song twisting is too much like hard work
lvl 15 Barb Beastlord... not a Monk, not a Mage, not a Shaman... deleted,
but might try again
lvl 24 HE Paladin... for when I want to RolePlay 'for real' :o)
