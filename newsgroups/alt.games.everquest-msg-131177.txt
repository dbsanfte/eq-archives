From www.dictionary.com (Their source being the American Heritage
Dictionary 4th edition):

Word History: An agnostic does not deny the existence of God and
heaven but holds that one cannot know for certain whether or not they
exist. The term agnostic was fittingly coined by the 19th-century
British scientist Thomas H. Huxley, who believed that only material
phenomena were objects of exact knowledge. He made up the word from
the prefix a-, meaning �without, not,� as in amoral, and the noun
Gnostic. Gnostic is related to the Greek word gnsis, �knowledge,�
which was used by early Christian writers to mean �higher, esoteric
knowledge of spiritual things� hence, Gnostic referred to those with
such knowledge. In coining the term agnostic, Huxley was considering
as �Gnostics� a group of his fellow intellectuals�ists,� as he called
themwho had eagerly embraced various doctrines or theories that
explained the world to their satisfaction. Because he was a �man
without a rag of a label to cover himself with,� Huxley coined the
term agnostic for himself, its first published use being in 1870

"does not deny the existance of god..." This itself rules out
"Atheists" as being able to be agnostic as well, since atheists deny
the existance of God. The word, as Huxly coined it, means roughly "not
knowing".
