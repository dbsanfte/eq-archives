I made no such claim.  My claim was about the norm for posting in this 
newsgroup, has nothing to do with what my personal preferences for 
posting are.

If the newsgroup, in general, regarded that as the norm, then go for it.

> What if posting was only if you used your in game name?

See above answer.

They might start posting in their own languages.  So far, if there are a 
lot here, they post in English, so, I'm not about to worry about it one 
way or the other.

These are not my views, these are the way people generally post here in 
this particular newsgroup.

I make no such claim.  I am informing you what the generally accepted 
norm is here, and you may choose to do what you will, others will make 
choices regarding your posts based on the choices you make.  Pretty 
simple really.
