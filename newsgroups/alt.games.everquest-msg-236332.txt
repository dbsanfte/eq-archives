I'm not so sure about that. The only already uber guilds that might
consider moving en mass would be the ones on servers where there are
already 6-8 guilds in time and a dozen in the elementals. These tend to
be the older servers and I'd guess if they're anything like mine, many
of those players have several alts and/or other accounts they've been
given by people retiring they'd want to have access to as well. When you
add it up it's going to come out to a couple of hundred dollars for many
long time players to make a comfortable move to the new server, with no
guarantee that they'll have any less crowded a playfield than their
current server. Plus they leave behind any friends they may have made
over the years who don't happen to be in their guild.

For the non-guilded player who wishes to be uber, the odds seem even
worse. This player is either non guilded because every guild on his
server is full of raging morons they don't want to associate with, or
because they're the raving moron that can't get into any high level
guild. In either case, going to a new server means starting a new guild
with other transferees, some of whom may be the raving morons that
couldn't get into any high end guild on their own server.

I know personally, if I were looking for a way off my current server and
into an uber guild, I'd be much more likely to search out pre-existing
guilds on other servers who seemed to fit my style of play and attitudes
that taking a chance on self selected random bunch of high level players
seeking a new start, but that's just me.

My prediction no complete guilds will transfer there, the high levels
that do will form a guild that crashes and burns in 3-6 months from
personality issues, and a significant number of people will powerlevel
themselves up like they did on Stromm to try to form the dominant guild.
Note also, the first uberguild to make it to Time on Stromm has already
appearanly self destructed.
