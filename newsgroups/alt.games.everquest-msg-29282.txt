Well I have seen the all consuming immersive player. We all have
fantasy worlds we would rather be in anyway.

Many of you we not born when MUDs, MUSEs and MUSHs came out. These
were Multi-User Dungeons, and a forerunner of EQ. I got addicted to
them myself. Those also broke up families. I even know of a woman
whose on line sexcapades led to her divorce. Same as any fantasy on
the net or otherwise. I have seen people dose out on DnD same way.

I like EQ and think about it a lot, but thats because it's a nice
reality to be in. I don't sit and play it all the time like many do. I
admit it has interfered with the things I ought to do, like exercise
and extra work. I agree that theres a lot of EverCrackheads, I
sometimes can't stand to be around them RL, because when I am away
from EQ, I want to be away from EQ.

It is indeed just a game.
