I have a 20 lvl ranger outfitted in banded armor.  She's got (I think) good
weapons for the next 7-10 lvls or so (blackened alloy longsword and polished
granite tomahawk).  But what would be the next upgrade of armor that she
should look for and the approximate cost or location to find it?

Thanks in advance.
