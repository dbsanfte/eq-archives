Sitting doubles the mana regeneration rate.  Bards (and all other classes) 
regen mana at 1mana/tick.  Sitting down is 2mana/tick.  Other than AA 
points, there is no way to improve bard mana regeneration.  I have tried 
songs, spells, mod rods, and necro twitches.  I haven't tried a manarobe, 
though I suspect they also will not work.
It takes about 80 minutes for me to get to FM after a rez, and I only have 
78 INT.  Bard mana is a sick joke.
