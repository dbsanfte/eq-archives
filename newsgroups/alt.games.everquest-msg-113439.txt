mind you i really dont mind being inspected but i dont like them getting rid
of the message cause it gave me a reason to use lines from movies like "you
keep eyeballin me boy and ill shove this sword so far up your ass youll be
beggin me to  kill you" (paraphrased obviously) or "you keep eyeballin me
like that son and i better at least get a reacharound"
