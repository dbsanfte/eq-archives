As it seems I usually do with Lyrral...

/concur

104 is fine at 22, and higher certainly won't hurt. When you pick up Solon's
Song of the Sirens (28 I think), you'll instantly want to move things up a
bit though. Most recommend getting above150 for charm related songs, but
that's usually unrealistic for most 30ish toons (Heck, I'm not quite there
at 48), so just do what you can  - certainly get it into the 120's or beyond
by the time you start charming.
