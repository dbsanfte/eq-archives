I dunno whether the OP has the problem I have, but I tried this,
several times.  On and off, I continually have problems with *one*
zone - Plane of Knowledge.  Doesn't happen outside of it and,
obviously, I've never had a chance to try it beyond PoK :/  But what
happens is, first one or two small things (say, all the posts in a
wall, or all the beds in bedrooms) will be completely white.  Then
when I turn around, something a little larger is white - a section of
wall here, a merchant there.  After about ten or fifteen minutes of
this, I'll open a door and the entire room will be white, as will the
merchants.  And then, when I leave again, the entire world is white.
It. HURTS. my eyes, and I haven't been able to work it out yet.  :/
It's gone the next time I log in, but soon happens again.  Doesn't
seem to be limited to one character, doesn't seem to be connected to
any one section of town.  I've tried deleting the txc files, turning
off texture caching completely, and playing that way, but it still
happened.  Tried turning on the caching again, still happened.  I just
reinstalled thanks to that whole earlier "oops, I didn't know that"
thing about installing EQ in two different directories, so I'm hoping
that'll clear up the problem.  This makes the problem where if I log
in a char in PoK or the Bazaar, I'll more than likely log in with no
channels, seem much less annoying than it was previously ;p

Oh, and the first time it happened, it seemed to affect wolf textures
to appear as some people have noted - the wrong colors completely -
but since then, I've not seen that again.
