Well I can help with the 2-boxing, get MacroQuest. (Don't play EQ anymore, 
wish I had know about this sooner, might have kept me around longer). Makes 
2-boxing on the same machine easier. Just set up some answer macros so you 
just say in group "heal me" and the cleric will cast a spell on you. Yes I 
know people will complain that this is cheating etc. I am not saying to use 
the map features etc, but for 2 boxing I don't know how you could make it 
any easier. This certainly explains the people that play 6 characters, 
always wondered how they could all seem responsive, 2 characters on 
different machines is easy, same machine pretty hard without an aid like 
this.

macroquest.sourceforge.net - sure it violates the EUL, but then so does 
selling plat and no one seems to get banned for that..............
