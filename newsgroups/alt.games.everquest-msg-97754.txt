I stand corrected, I forgot about toxx because the only erudite I ever
played was a shadowknight (paineel is a good one).

Actually I liked Steamfont. You needed to group at certain levels if
you wanted to stay there, but it was very good 1-12.

On the positive side its newbie zones (there are two) are VERY well
popuated.

My elf twinks normally switch to SF rather than stay in GFay.

Anyways you can always go to BB or CB at L7-8, lots of stuff there and
not a very far walk.

Almost all my characters, mains and twinks, leveled in faydwer,
including my first character ever. I hold the entire continent in some
nostalgic esteem.
