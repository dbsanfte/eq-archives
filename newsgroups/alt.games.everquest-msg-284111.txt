Why do you suppose the spell "True North" was put into the
game?

Why do you suppose druids were given heals and clerics
were given nukes?

Why do you suppose necros were given heals?

Why do you suppose magician mana rods were nerfed?

Having an option simply means that you have an option.  You're
not obliged to use it, and simply having it doesn't make it the
best or even a good solution for all or any situations.

You  have the option of taking your foot out of your mouth,
for instance, but I don't see you doing it.
