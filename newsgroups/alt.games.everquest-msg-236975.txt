Unless you have a strong group of level 65 friends, you'll likely
have to wait until your 60'ish to get it.

The PoP charm gets it's power from how many flags you have -
Complete the PoJ trials (for PoV/PoS access) and you go hail
Gram Drunnar in PoK (building near the Freeport book).  He gives
you your charm, and an AA for the flag.

After that, your charm gets stronger each time you complete a flag.
The ones I have on my mage are:
PoJ
BoT (quested)
PoT (tactics - the quested version)
HoH (from an AD kill)
CoD (from a Grummus kill)

That gives +5 to all saves, +40hp, +50 mana, +6ac,
+7 dex, +5sta, +7int, +5 agi.  

The exact effects of the charm differ depending on
if you're an Int caster, Wis caster, Hybrid or Pure
melee.
