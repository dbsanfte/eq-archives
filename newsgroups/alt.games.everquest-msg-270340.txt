If you find it available anywhere for straight download, let us know.
I've tried BitTorrent several times in the past and have always been
disappointed - usually ending up with fragments of the file I want but
never the whole thing, not once.

You know the old saying about only getting one chance to make a good
first impression? BitTorrent missed several chances with me. I know it
has its fans and userbase, but based on past experiences I won't go
through the effort of installing it yet again.

I'd like to try the AO offer, though, so if a 'real' download location
is available, I'd jump on the chance.
