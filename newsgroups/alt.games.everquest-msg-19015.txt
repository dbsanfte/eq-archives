I work 5 days a week, i have a long term girlfriend whom I adore and live
with. I see my friends regularly and go out for meals, drinks and walks in
the country. All of which is life. Another fun thing in my life is to cast
off the shackles of mortal existance and control my Avatar in a fantasy
world full of characters from childhood (and Adulthood) fantasy fiction. I
do battles and have great fun with friends I have made in the fantasy
realms. Then I switch it off and carry on with life. Everquest is addictive
in that it is fun to play and interact with. A very few people are truly
addicted and are capable of nothing else but in modern society the majority
of the people that do not have the presence of mind to keep up with the rat
race turn to one thing or another. I would gladly have 50 EQ addicts then 50
heroin addicts as EQ harms no one but the quest for drugs etc. hurts
themselves and a lot of others.
