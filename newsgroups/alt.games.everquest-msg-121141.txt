Which 50-60 wizards actually use ice comet though?

It's not a spell my wizard ever had memmed, or any wizard in my guild for
that.

Mind you, I suppose mana/damage ratio doesn't matter when your mana pool is
a 10 digit figure.. not like you need to use draughts (as a real player
would)

Are we going to see enchanter mobs casting c2/kei now?    Cleric mobs
forming a cheal rotation on their "tank"?

I heard Velketor got sunstrike, not sure if its true tho, or how much the
encounter has changed.. been quite a while since we killed him
