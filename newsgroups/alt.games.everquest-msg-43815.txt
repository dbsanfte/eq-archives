It is also full of NON-drooling NON-fanbois. I would say you get a lot more
varied opinion there than you do here, simply due to the much higher message
traffic.

I have been through the top post vs bottom post things before, and the fact
is, until people learn to edit the top part so I don't have to scroll down
through 500 lines of repeated stuff so I can read "I agree" at the bottom, I
will continue to top post.
