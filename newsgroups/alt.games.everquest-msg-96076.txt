Did you check the voltage of the power plug you're using for the CD-ROM?  I
haven't the foggiest what it should be, I'm not into electricity, but that's
what I'd check if I knew more about it. <g>  Or do you use the same power
plug every time?

As for being hot and kids being involved, keep in mind that it only takes
one peanut-buttery hand to put in only one CD one time to get crap in the
drive...stuff I can't imagine CD cleaners would solve.  I'm thinking that a
CD-ROM would be running awfully hot trying to spin at the correct speed when
it has PB&J in its mechanism.
