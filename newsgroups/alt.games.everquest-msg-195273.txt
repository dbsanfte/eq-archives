It's silly to consider operating with a particular buff a requirement for 
normal play. Once it gets to that point, either a nerf or some form of 
positive class balancing is in order. 

If said "shammy" is going OOM during a heavy brawl, then either a) they 
are using their mana inefficiently, b) there aren't enough people in 
their group or c) their group is over pulling. KEI doesn't change any of 
that, it just increases the number of mobs it takes to experience the 
same problems. It's training wheels. It's a safety net. It's a crutch.

A lot of people get off on being able to say, "We killed MOBx tonight!" 
That's all well and good, however if everyone in the raid was succling on 
KEI, they should understand that's almost like an asterisk on their chart 
of accomplishments.

Nope. Then again, that's not what we're talking about now, is it? We're 
talking about a crutch that people can't seem to feel content without.
