Bah!  I will not renew, I will not renew, I WILL NOT RENEW!  ::clings to 
money::  Anyway, my point was, I wasn't even hoping to get a key (isn't 
it like 50+ groups anyway?) but just to help out for once ;p  I was 
about 38 at that point and getting very, very sick of hearing "raid, 40+ 
in one week" and then listening to them on the day of the raid "wtf, 
where is everybody, this guild is sad!  Why aren't you people out 
here?"  Pfft. :p

(What's doubly sad is that *most* of the guild population was below 40, 
anybody who was above that was usually an officer anyway, and they'd 
always complain about there being only officers at raids)
