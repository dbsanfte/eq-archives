My intent is all well in good.  Intent is a very important part of
communication, but it still comes down to the listener deciding to be
offended for the most part.

Hell, if somebody it talking to me and their intent is to offend,
insult, or make me angry, I'm just the kind of contrary sonsabitch
that will make it a point to become more pleasant and oblivious to
their aggression for the sole purpose of irritating them.

Might not be the best way to foster communication, but it can be fun.
