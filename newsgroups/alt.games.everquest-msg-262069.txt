Previously when you charmed and your group was un aggroed you'd just 
follow the charmer around like a pet until it wore off. This is what -
should- have happened from preivous experiences. But its not what 
happened, twice.

Its an interesting question. I'd have to repeat the 'experiment'. :)

In the case of the monk, its worth pointing out that the 3 skeletons ran 
at us -before- the monk got to us.

At any rate it doesn't explain why I unleashed a swarm back on my group 
when I finally died. Even if I'd been feared and charmed (which I'd 
swear I wasn't) I never got back to my group. But once charm broke and 
they killed me they tore off after my group. (And I died well out of 
sight of the group.)
