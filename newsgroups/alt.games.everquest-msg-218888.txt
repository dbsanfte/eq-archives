It's not ebay, it's twinking and/or PL'ing.  Why do you need to learn 
how to stun mobs when they're dying so fast, and in such large numbers, 
that you don't have time to stun them.

And it's not even always their fault.  They haven't twinked their 
paladin, but the rest of their pickup group is twinked, and in say, 
Paludal, and the mobs are dying so quick, that all the paladin has time 
to do is /assist and whack away, no need to use the spells.
