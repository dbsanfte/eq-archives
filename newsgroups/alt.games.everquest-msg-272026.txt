I don't need you to acknowledge anything. I'd need the game's story to, 
to accept it as part of the suspension as disbeleif. There is no good 
reason to rationalize every game constraint and hiccup as part of the 
fantasy.

Accept zoning as 'part of the fantasy'? No, I don't. I suppose you think 
graphical artifacts like walking through trees, getting stuck in 
geometry, or falling through the world from time to time are also 'part 
of the fantasy'?

Or do you wander around telling yourself: In norrath, as everybody 
knows, many trees grow as insubstantial holograms (not to mention 
coutless other apparently solid and substantial objects). And "I didn't 
just get stuck in the geometry... I must have stepped on some gum." And 
the /reset command... that's just a funny way of spelling 'clean gum 
offa boots' and falling through the world and popping in at the succor 
point... well that's clearly not a suspension jarring game glitch, a 
wizard must have just translocated me.

Me? I'll just keep on looking past these defects, seeing them for what 
they are, and forgiving them as they occur, but if you want to accept 
them as *part of the fantasy* feel free. Its not that I lack 
imagination, I'm just not interested in rationalizing why all the 
objects I see strewn about houses are glued to the floor, why homeowners 
occasionally choose to build walls out of holographic wood from the 
holographic trees, why nearly all animals have the ability to teleport 
seemingly at will, through solid objects... I don't think any of that 
crap is 'part of the fantasy'.

I quite prefer to imagine that Norrathian wolves are more endowed with 
magical teleportation powers than real wolves. And when they do 
teleport, I don't accept it as part of the fantasy, but see it as a 
forgivable glitch in the game.
