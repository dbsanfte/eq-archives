It's not just RV, sound can be horrible with Win2k.  Hell, I'm still using
my INTEGRATED sound card after about a year on my Win2k machine because as
far as I know, NO good sound card NEVER has a problem with Win2k/EQ combo
(including turtle beach), and I'd rather not spend $100+ on a sound card
only to find out that I have to turn off $95 worth of the features.

You don't have to buy a full version of WinMe, an upgrade version is
fine...you just have to install it on a clean hard drive (well, no OS
anyway).  The only difference between the CDs is one looks for a qualifying
OS and one doesn't.  I'm ASSUMING (since earlier versions of Windows did)
that if you don't have one installed it'll prompt you to prove that you DO
have a qualifying OS (by inserting the CD).

I'd give the same advice:  want clear sound?  Use Win98SE or WinMe (I don't
particularly care for the latter).  Want a faster, smoother game?  Get 512MB
RAM and upgrade your video card.  If it's still not smooth enough, upgrade
your OS version and buy more RAM (lots more, since Win2k/XP require more
just to run).
