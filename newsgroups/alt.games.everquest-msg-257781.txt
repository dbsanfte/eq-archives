:) I think that they cost mana.  All mages, at the lowest levels, get
something like the necromancer line of spells. They can perpetually
convert their own health to mana at a decent ratio.  They then transfer
that mana to others. And keep up mana-regen buffs on others.  They are
something like a generator.  They do require, however, a HoT from the
priest to keep this up.  How this manages to result in a net gain of mana
I have no idea, but I'm assuming someone did the math to make it work,
because this is precisely the technique that was being used by a group at
E3.

Yess...I know that Shadowknights use lifetaps as a major part of their
power. Incidently, I don't think necros will get lifetaps, since they've
made a big deal out of saying that the magic of SKs and paladins is their
own special deal and not shared with the one-time-parent-classes.  (IE,
they aren't hybrids anymore.)  But I don't know that for certain about the
necros. I suspect that dirges (evil bards) will get mana taps.  I bet some
mages will too.

They've told us very little about the spells, alas.  The main site has 3
spells listed for each archetype, 3 for each class, and 3 for each
subclass, including dirges, troubadours, sks, and pallys, who are the only
casters outside the mage and healer archetypes.  (Yep, s'right, no more
spells for rangers. O.O )  You can get a sense of the flavor from there,
but as everyone knows, you need to know allthe spells to really understand
what any class is capable of.
