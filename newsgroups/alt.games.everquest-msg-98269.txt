Ok and here is my opinion in Sather move all together:


He receive:Pavel Bure 26g 32a 57p
           Tom Poti 1g 16a 17p -7 +/-
           Rem Murray 7g 17a 24p +7 +/-
           2nd rounder

He give :Mike York 16g 39a 57p
         Igor Ulanov 0g 6a 6p -4 +/-
         Filip Novak 2nd rounder one of top prospect of rangers
         1rst rounder
         2nd rounder


So lets analyse this.He gave his young player York who got the same amount 
of points than Bure.He sacrifice another part of his future with Novak and 
a 1rst rounder.He get a checking forward as murray and a dmen a bit better 
than Ulanov.

So far killed by Sather are:York,Brendl,Johnson,Hlavac,Novak and 2 first 
rounder.


So far is acquisition are Lindros,Bure,Poti.

Lindros didnt deliver what he expected,Bure seem going down(but MIGHT start 
back with the rangers) and he receive Poti(who was consider one of the top 
young dmen but he simply play bad recently.

If rangers do not make the playoff...can i tell ya that Sather head will be 
off????


He construct the Oilers...and now he start demolishing the Rangers.Bravo 
Glen!Now cross yur finger that Bure will produce!
