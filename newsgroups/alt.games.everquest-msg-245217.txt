After some thought on the issue I really think the main problem with
EQ (and many of the older games) is that the AI engine is pathetic.
Course this is due to when it was written but after playing a couple
of other games I can say that a stronger AI allows a much better
balance of player classes. Wizzie type mobs that hit like war and nuke
like a moron are not needed because the mob is acting according to its
class and doing it fairly well. Also mobs tend to seem to work
together in a much more realistic fashion. This takes the burden off
the melee classes and puts more on the caster classes who may not have
the hitpoints to survive a large nuke. Mobs focus on healers and
nukers quickly if the melee isnt doing a good job and may do it
anyway. Smarter mobs make for better play and EQ mobs are dumb as
rocks for the most part. Just something to consider, seriously hope
future releases take this to heart. Till then dont think theres any
way to have a fair balance between player classes.
