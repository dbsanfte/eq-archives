With people I know, I'll take either (or both) but I'm kinda hesitant
to ask a druid that I don't know to play main healer. Some that I've
run across have been less than spectacular at the job. 

A lot of the groups I'm doing these days are centered around Druid,
Paladin, Shaman (just because of who's online at the same time I am)
and I'm starting to really like that combo. You have healing, rez,
slow, snare, tracking, tanking, stuns, (instant) evac, haste, group
heals and Damage shields  covered. Pretty much any other classes
complement that trio. Only thing it's really lacking is a good way to
pull singles indoors. Druid will heal initially until I get things
slowed then I'll take over with Quissence while the druid switches to
nukes or rains. 

In defense of the original poster, from what I recall there's a pretty
big healing gap for druids between 39-58, Shaman get their first
decent slow at 39 to help keep people alive but druids have to live
with the same heals we had at that level w/o the benefit of slow. I
can see where that would be pretty daunting in a lot of zones. 

Rgds, Frank
