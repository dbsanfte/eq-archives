Actually in most societies the actions of offspring directly affect the
reputation of the family as a whole and the parents in particular. It is
just the breakdown of family units and values in western culture that has
given us this idea that kids are a dumbfire missile: conceive and hope for
the best. You cannot underestimate the positive effects of the basics: a
stable home, an positive example of no substance abuse, gambling or violence
and a good education to name but a few. It is no guarantee of course, but
you are really pushing the odds when you fail to provide the basics.

Yup - that's why I finished the sentence with "Nonsense? Yes of course -
thats the whole point."

As an aside, in China if you commit one of the numerous crimes that result
in a death penalty - after they shoot you they send the bill for the bullet
back to you parents.
