Eh, that would work for anyone over level 55 or so, and a damned good idea
(I mean, come on, if you're 55 and guildless there IS some stigma attached).
But there's 500,000 level 30s out there (obviously exagerating)...the
chances of anyone else in the guild ever hearing of the person is kinda
slim.  If they're invited in and one of the other guildies sees the name and
says "why the fuck did we invite that slimeball?" then obviously something
needs to be done.

Yes, I know of some ultra-strict guilds.  The ones I know are all uber but
having my highest character 54 I guess that's not surprising (I really want
to become a Beguiler, though C2 is awfully nice :) ).
