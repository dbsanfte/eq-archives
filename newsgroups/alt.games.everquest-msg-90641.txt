I do have sympathy for the customer support we all have that problem whether
in the US or not its a long distance call (excepting SD). As far as one
server goes, they had trouble filling that server so obviously not a huge
need for european servers. European guilds on my server have had the
advantage on the Uber mobs until a recent patch. Now that they don't get the
first shot on those mobs they are wanting a rotation schedule on the mobs.
So although there are disadvantages to being in europe for a couple years
europeans had the end game advantages.
