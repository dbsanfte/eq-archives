On the subject of weird charm stuff, I got charmed by an NPC once and 
then charmed another PC.  Charm wore off me first and I had a PC pet for 
several minutes.  The poor guy didn't have control of his keyboard so he 
eventually rebooted his machine.  It didn't help, he stayed my pet until 
charm wore off, then despawned.  Too bad neither of us realized what was 
going on.
