Lance is also comparing L1 characters.  The computation of HP changes
with level.  Some examples:
1) Melees under L10 appear to get some extra HP (5 at L1) that, along
with low level STA bonus HP, are treated by the game differently from
other HP.  If you check your HP total right after respawn due to death
at very low level you will see that you do not get all your HP back
immediately, you have to heal the extra.  I have never seen this effect
on higher level characters.
2) Back during melee balancing they announced an increase to the HP
of Paladins and SKs above level 25
3) When my Warrior hit either 30 or 31 (forget which, it's been a
while) his HP jumped by about 110, instead of the 30ish that was
usual for a level increase (half-elf with barely over 100 STA).
I have a 29 Ogre Warrior on Test I haven't played much recently, I was
gonna watch to see if he got a similar bump, if/when I get around to
getting the next two levels.
