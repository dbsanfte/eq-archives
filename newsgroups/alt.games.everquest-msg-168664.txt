Wow. I guess most of you have a different idea of "Need Before Greed"
than what I grew up with. "Need" would imply that you're actually going
to use it yourself. Doesn't matter if it's a melee item or a parchment.
If you already have all your spells you can get from the parchment drops
and you roll/claim a parchment on NB4G, then you're as much of a dickwad
as the melee who grabs up a CoF and turns around and sells it even if
there were other melee there who would have equipped it. If every caster
in the group has all their spells they can get from parchments, then
call a spade a spade and make it a greed roll for everyone to go sell a
spell for cash. But if you are grouped with somebody who hasn't been
there long enough (or has been unlucky on roll, or only just got PoP in
the stores in Tahiti this week, or whatever) and you let a melee walk
off with a parchment that's pretty fucked up.

Casters have, for AGES, been dealing the fact that most of the early
expansion drops were melee stuff and watched tons of it wander off while
they left raids with nothing but negative xp to show for it. You're not
going to find much sympathy here if the melee have to spend some time
not instantly htiting the fucking Big Plat Lottery.
