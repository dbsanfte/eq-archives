You'd like to be in the guild that broke off the arrangement that neither of
these guilds would wake him?
These guys have left the guild because they do not agree with what the other
members of that guild have taken upon themselves to do.
Maybe each of these people feel the only way they can hold onto some honour
is no longer be associated with the Guild that broke this agreement.
Before the Erics of the world come back with "It's just a game, stop crying"
if anyone wants to roleplay having some honour in a ROLEPLAYING game I say
more Kudos to them.
