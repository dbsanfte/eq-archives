Or more likely... not at all. You wait for the corpse to pop, but its 
too late to xp rez. You wiped... you died...

Thats the issue. I agree that *making* you go back is cruel...the 
graveyards should exist... but they shouldn't have xp rezzable corpses.

What exactly is the risk of dying at the hi-end game now? Even Quake has 
a greater penalty...you're pretty much defenceless while you rebuild 
your health, ammo, and amour...  vs the new improved eq... where its 
corpse pop, rez, loot... and take another run at the raid target. 
Lowbies have more to lose from dying then raiders... simply because 
lowbies don't have 11 65th level clerics running around behind them. And 
what clerics they might have with them have 50% rezzes not 96%...
