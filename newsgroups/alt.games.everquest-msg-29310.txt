What Kilmir said. :)

Basically it's this:  Verant asked itself "Would the players rather die
while zoning or have all their buffs/debuffs stripped, and sent to a "safe
spot" in the next zone to recouperate?"

If you'd just gotten clarity and almost died while zoning then it kinda
sucks to lose it <g> but I WOULD rather that happen.

I don't know at what point the decision is made.  It seemed to me that my
characters in their 40s lost them when the HP got not much below 100, but I
also remember it happening with my level 6-10s...and hell you only HAVE
100hp then (approx) so the number must be much lower...or based on the zone.
Or something totally different...I've never cared enough to find out.  I
play the game to play, not to know programming code. :-p
