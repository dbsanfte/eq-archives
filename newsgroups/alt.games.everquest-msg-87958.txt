And all this time I thought it was because you got whipped like a cur.

Funny how you make vague, meaningless statements as though you thought
they contained a point.

>The guy had an opinion and you pounced right on it.

Yup. Had he'd stated some supporting comments for his opinion he'd
have invited debate. As it was, he invited only derision.

>Yea, its your newsgroup.

No, it isn't. But it's amusing to see which people make that claim.
There certainly seems to be a pattern.

>Kinda like being queen of the dump.

You compare the group to a dump, and you claim to have given it up.
Yet here you are. Curious.

>Cmon over to my server and let me slap your ass around.

Will that help reduce the stinging and swelling you're suffering from
having your ass slapped around here? I mean, if it will make you feel
better about yourself, I'll be delighted to help.
