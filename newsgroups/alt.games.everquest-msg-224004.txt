My LDON groups love to have a bard, whether or not we have a chanter. CC,
pulling, haste/slow songs, mana song, adds a bit of DPS, even the limited
bard tracking if we don't have a druid or ranger -- it's all good.

In general LDON's structure increases the value of including versatile
classes in your group (compared to regular exp grouping). What class is more
versatile than a bard? As a beastlord I've benefitted from this, I never
have any trouble getting into a LDON group. When I'm forming a group I'm
always looking for a bard. Had a dual-bard group recently that chewed right
through the mission.
