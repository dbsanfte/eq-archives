It varies depending on how many patches they want to apply to the live system.


Get it right on time first time = Unknown, never happened
Get it right first time, but delayed = 2 weeks on test
one emergency patch = 1 week on test
Two emergency patches = 3 days on test
Two emergency patches, a withdrawral, a repatch and a nerf = 1 day on test

Currently there is no scheduled down time on the web site.

The Up comming updates page is due to be updated today :
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp

So expect an announcement there later today.

I would guess that they will simultaniously schedule some downtime for 
next week or the week after (Probably Thu 12th or Tue 17th). However 
your guess is as good as mine as to what will be in the patch.

Spell organisation upgrades, Grouping bonuses, Flag removal, Xp giving 
range extention, Spelling corrections, random quest breaking, New 
zone(s), and Aoe nerf and an upgrade to the CoRathe encounter could all 
fine a place in it and thats just off the top of my head.


We could be in for a "fun" patch, depending on you deffinition of "fun".

HTH,

Jim
