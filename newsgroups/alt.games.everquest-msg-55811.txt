Mind you, I didn't take this trip, but during the course of the events,
allegedly there was a new, second NPC someplace near Frankel, and if you
hailed him and talked to him, he would port you straight to the docks in
Iceclad. The boats were cancelled during the haloween event period
(ending yesterday?) and you got free intercontinental ports.
