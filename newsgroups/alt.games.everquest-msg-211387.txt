in the 'gaymer' thread, someone said something like "it's just a game"

and that made me think....sure, it is a game, but that doesn't mean it
doesn't matter

(i would have responded to the person who said this in that post, but i'm
not gonna make a post in that thread, it's much too big, plus this is a side
issue)

does anyone else feel that despite the fact eq is a game, it doesn't exist
in the 'not-real' categories that other games fit into? like monopoly, or
baseball?

it's a game, but if you get pk'd over and over and over, that grief you feel
is real ..the fact that it was caused by a game doesn't change that, it's
someone going out of their way to cause aggravation

or better examples:

if i have a fight with a rl friend who plays eq, and another rl friend logs
on and groups with me, not the first friend, then the two of us have ditched
that first person....does it matter if it's everquest or a car ride to the
ice cream store?

if i spend 45 minutes logging on all my characters and casting all their
spells to buff up player A so when i play my appropriate-level alt with
player A, we can level faster, but player A goes and solo's, then wouldn't i
have a right to be upset? that person screwed me, and that's aggravating
whether it happens in norrath or kansas

so.....sorry if this topic has been discussed to death, like kei and
twinking and good websites for certain classes, but i definitely think that
the phrase "it's just a game" doesn't apply to eq

if that previous statement defines me as a fanatical eq player, then [/bow]
maybe i can grind out 62-65 after all . ..

i look forward to your responses
