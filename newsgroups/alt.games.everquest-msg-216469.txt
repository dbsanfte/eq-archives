Seriously, your best "droppable" weapon will be your summoned hammer.  It
will out-DPS any weapon you could possibly buy.  Try to get a DEX buff if
you can, and watch your hammer proc and proc and proc.

No matter how good the weapon, clerics simply aren't great at melee.  We
miss a lot and hit for miniscule damage when we do hit.  So the
ever-proccing summoned hammer is by far your best bet, as the continuous
procs will provide quite decent damage.  Don't forget to cast Yaulp V or
Yaulp VI, too.
