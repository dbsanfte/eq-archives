Well, despite there not being any more hell levels, 32 has taken on the
semblance of a hell level for me. I spent about two weeks at 32 back in
September; this was enough to drive me to cancel my subscription for a
while, until renewing it just the other day. I've managed to since get three
yellow bubbles into the level; only trouble is, they were gotten under
circumstances that I doubt will repeat anytime soon; a guild raid into TOFS.
So, I'm stuck.

Just for a little background, I did Unrest until about level 23, did Paludal
for a level, then Unrest for another couple of levels, then HHK until about
29, at which point I switched to charm solo'ing in Echo; that was enough to
get me to most of the way through 31. I got the rest of 31 solo'ing in odd
places where I could find two blue mobs close to each other; it was slow,
but it worked. However, now I'm stuck. I can charm solo, group, whatever
works, but there's one caveat; NO OVERTHERE. That zone is enough to make me
want to hang myself out a window. It's -that- terrible, in my opinion. My
entire contribution as an Enchanter is buffing, then sitting on my ass and
reading.

So, any suggestions as to where I could go? My server's usually fairly well
populated, so I doubt finding people to group with will be a big problem.
