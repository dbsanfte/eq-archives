It's that "fighting something unfamiliar" that I was thinking of.  I've
got an unknown faction hit in Stonebrunt now from helping a guildmate
kill a quest mob, which is annoying.  Also, my guild is just starting to
get into Luclin, and not knowing how things affect faction there really
puts a crimp on what you can do.
