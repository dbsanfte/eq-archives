Huh?? I can't believe you think it's easier to level in CoH than EverQuest.
That's just flat-ass wrong. EverQuest is infinitely easier and faster and I
don't know anyone who is familiar with both games who would disagree. The
problem is that most EQ players don't stick it out above level 30 where it
really starts to slow down, so they don't experience that end of the
spectrum. Getting from 30-50 in EQ is *nothing* compared to getting from
30-50 in CoH.
