I see a lot of guessing here but this is how it is. In Katta if you worship an
evil God then you are KoS no matter what race. In Sanctus Seru if you are an
evil race you are KoS now matter what God you worship. Unfortunately there is no
easy way to get faction. For Katta you either need to kill guards in Sanctus
Seru which will make you more KoS there or kill lots and lots of Vampyres in
Tenebrous mountains.

Hope this helps.
