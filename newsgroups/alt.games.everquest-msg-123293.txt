I got "I'll give you the 20pp it's worth"

me: "No, you're thinking of a crude Stein, Moggok's go for 200pp"

him: "No they don't, they go for 20pp"

Went around and around with this guy who insisted they were only worth 20pp
and actually got angry that I wouldn't sell it to him for that.

I actually had a newbie in Misty ask me if I had a rusty sword to spare. I
was touched. I gave him some plat and sent him off to the merchants to buy a
weapon.
