Did so. :-p  neener neener.

Your rewording doesn't change anything. The only reason that I can not
*personally* envision such an instance is because of personal
observation. I have not met all of the six year olds on the planet
(THANK THE GAWDS!) but from the ones I have interacted with, I don't
normally see the behaviour, mental development, emotional development,
etc. to where they would be forming such philosophical and emotional
concepts to the point where they could develop the kind of hatred
towards a class, race, etc. to have that sort of hatred, nor an
understanding of the concept of death, killing, et. al. to grasp the
implications of grabbing a weapon and gunning down some <fill in ethnic,
gender, etc. here.>
  This, of course, doesn't mean that it's not *possible* I suppose. Some
new age Einstein might be capable of doing advanced calculus and
discussing the Socratic Method at age six someplace, but have a few
mental gears out of whack and build his own pipe bombs and take matters
into his own hands. I can't *personally* envision it happening, but if
it's theoretically possible, and it then happened, then hell yeah. Lock
him up. Fry him. Whatever is called for. If he's that much of an
advanced adult already, then treat him as such.  You have not given me
the specifics of any hypothical case involving this hypothetical six
year old, though, so I can't answer. Again, it would be a case by case
basis [I keep saying that, because it's the heart of the answer to the
question, and I know it annoys you. :-)] and you haven't provided a
"case" here. I just fine the likelihood of such a "case" to be very,
very low.

Exactly. Once again... case by case. The first would not, the second
would. Thank you for agreeing that you can't set a firm "number limit"
on the age of the accused in such rulings.
