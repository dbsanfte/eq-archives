Actually I usually say "/ooc Gladly willing to donate 60 PP for a rez..." or
whatever.
"Paying" to me is like paying bills or for groceries.  Like you don't have a
choice / like you may resent it but you "have" to.  
I feel like I'm gladly donating to show appreciation for your time, mana and
effort.  Although I guess it's really the same thing...
FWIW my druid has never accepted payment for "near death" heals and curing
diseases or poisons, (and a couple of the "donations" people have offered in my
trade window for healing are enough to make me gasp.  Sometimes it's damn hard
to hit the "cancel" button, but I always do) .  *THOSE* are my duty as a druid,
IMO.  
Sows, ports and buffs are NOT my duty, they are my choice - and I accept those
"donations" if I am hunting.  If I'm sitting around chatting I don't.
