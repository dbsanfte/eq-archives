I can't tell if that's an opinion ("mobs shouldn't have a range
advantage unless they're large") or an observation ("mobs don't have
a range advantage unless they're large").  If the latter then my
experience is contrary to it.  The most obvious example is when you
are mutually rooted (Paladin fighting ghouls in LGuk, ghouls proc a
root and Paladin uses root to avoid runners) and you are out of
range while the mob keeps beating on you.  From a "realism" point
of view this is extremely annoying when it's an unarmed 4-1/2 foot
tall mob clawing at a 6-foot PC wielding a 5- or 6-foot long weapon,
that's the kind of game mechanic that just rips the heart out of the
"immersion" when it happens.
