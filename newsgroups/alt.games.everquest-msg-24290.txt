As far as I know, having done the quest a kazillion times, Clurg has 
nothing whatsoever to do with tradesfolk faction.  Faction with clurg 
seems to relate to the following factions:

(a)  Clurg  (suprise, suprise. :) )
(b)  Craknek Warriors
(c)  Greenblood Knights

And possibly one other Oggok faction, like Citizens of Oggok.  

The best way of raising these factions?  Cast Illusion: Dark Elf.  Sad but 
true.  Alliance or Benevolence help as well.   

You can also raise them by doing the lizard meats and lizard tails quests 
for the warrior and SK guilds... but be warned... some of those quests 
also give negative hits with the other group, so it takes a bit of 
finagling.
