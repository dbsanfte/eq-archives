Or, if you have a modicum of self control, you can just not worry about what
the real gender is behind each player and play the game, rather than seeing
a female character and immediately sprouting a boner and shrieking:

"HYUK!  A GURL!  WANNA CY |3ER?  GOT NE N00D PIX?  HERE IS A HELMET, IT'S
WORTH 20K!  WHENEVER YOU LOOK AT IT THINK ABOUT POLISHING MY 'HELMET' TOO
OKAY?  HYUK!"

And then when the girl tells you that she's really a guy because you want to
fly to Australia to meet "her" and maybe get some hot action with the cool
chick from Everquest, you get all pissed off and start shrieking about those
fucking manginas and how they're ruining the game by tricking innocent kind
guys like you and that guys who play female characters should all be banned
and you heard that that's what Blizzard is going to do with WoW because
Blizzard R00LZ the fucking world.
