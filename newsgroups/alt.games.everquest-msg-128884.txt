The scenario:
I have a date with a dragon some time in the next week or two (depending
on who winds up going in what order). The guest of honor is, of course,
Ragefire.

The options:
I have a good old, reliable 55 tank camped in the area with full raid
buffs, ready to go. He won't wind up being MA, so will be relegated to
the "other damage dealers" crowd. And a piss poor one, at that, but he
has solid resist gear, has done this dragon before, and can come in
swinging a big 2 hander and at least contribute something with a good
chance of not being feared. Plenty of HP to suck up the AoE for a while.

Or... a barely 49 wizard who will be dying to try out his fancy new Ice
Comet spell on something big. Wizzy has pretty good resist gear, and
with equipment, plus flappy, plus self buffs, mage summoned item, and
raid buffs can get MR/CR/FR all well over 100.

The problem:
While it would be VERY cool to try to land a big ass ice-based nuke on
this bastard a few times, I won't be much good to the raid if I spend
the entire thing either running around the zone in Fear, or laying
around the zone dead from AoEs.

I've always sort of had the impression that level was the biggest factor
against Dragon AoE's. Higher level = Better chance of success.  Then
again, this wizard has already done Vox and Naggy and stood up pretty
well to their onslaught.  Many people compare Rage to Naggy. Not sure
how they match up line for line, though. Are good resist numbers in the
mid 100's range good enough in all cases, even being lower level? Or
will they not do me any good for being too low?

Stick with the boring old reliable, or go with the newer, sleeker model
and try to sneak in some nukes? Will the six level difference pretty
much make me a sitting duck and of no value to the raid? Worth even
trying?
