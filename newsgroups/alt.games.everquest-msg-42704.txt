While rarely one to miss a chance to slag Windows, I'm gonna say that
the problem in this case is most likely something that either Verant
or one of their ISPs did.  Now if I could only get this upgraded video

that just will NOT work right in EQ, though sometimes it thinks its a
TNT2, not sure I like the idea of universal drivers.)
