There is a lot of bitching about the trials on PoN.  Time-geared
Paladins (over 10k HP and 2k AC) are finding some of the mobs
untankable without 2 Clerics or Cleric + Druid.  Trash mobs that
hit for 1400+, and bosses that are slowable, but not stunnable,
and quad for over 2k per hit don't sound like good targets for an
"average group of 65's".  Needing two healers for single-group
trials that can take hours to complete seems a bit extreme.  I'm
glad the "ubers" have something new to occupy their time.  ;)
