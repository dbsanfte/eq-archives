Unrest is horrible!  I've never gone there without dying, and that
includes at level 41 when I hit the sit hotkey by mistake inside and
got harmtouched for about 900 points of damage by various mobs.  It
brought my unbuffed self down into my last bubble of health, where all
the green *easy* monsters decided to jump me, too.

If only those jack-o-lanterns weren't so much fun to kill.  OWW!
