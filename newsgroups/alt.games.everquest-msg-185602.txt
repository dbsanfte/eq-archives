     I can't seem to find any site that has good info on these expansions.  If
you're level 40 and not ready for the planes is there anything else the plane
of knowledge offers other than teleporting?  I couldn't find a quest or
anything in the brief time i've spent there so far and haven't been able to
find a site that tells much about it.  
     As for the LoY expansion, I downloaded it today and can't find anyone or
anyplace to even tell me how to get to the new zones.  Help!!
