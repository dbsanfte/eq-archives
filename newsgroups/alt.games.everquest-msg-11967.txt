Slow? Aye, waiting for a shaman to tank a mob will be interminably
slow!

Like when all the *real* tanks are dead?

What on Norrath makes you say that? You claim that shamans are *as
good as* SKs, Pallys or Rangers. Surely any group in Sebilis would be
crying out for a shaman to tank for them?! Next raid on Plane of Fear?
Get a shaman in as main assist! After all, they rival SKs/Pallys at
tanking. 

Everyone knows that, don't they? Well, don't they? Hellloooooo?
