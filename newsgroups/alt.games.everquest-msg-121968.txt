Kael drop rates suck in general, however the SK guild/Iceshard keep area.
seems to have relatively high plate drop rates.

54 druid (me), 53 warrior, and 56 monk with a botted 56 cleric could hold
the bank, we moved to the SK guild and picked up a 55 or 56 monk (anon and
yellow to me), but we left after a wipeout on Vorken Iceshard (I went LD
about 10% of the way into fight, and he was down to about 15% health when
the second monk was the only one standing and Vorken gated.

About 2 days /played in Kael, mostly arena and I've seen, chain BP (single
group in the arena, with no shaman, rangers or rogues, lost roll to a 52
warrior who immediatly asks "what do I do with this"), leather bracer (lost
to a the only other person who wanted, a monk), plate arms (gogogo drama, no
clue wtf happened to them, but 5 people got to argue over them) and a silk
piece or two, arms and gloves I think.

Lately the auction channel on my server is the WTB velium hound furs and
Thurg plate MQ channel.
