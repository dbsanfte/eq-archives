If I may add another exception...

If a cleric can get a DA or DB through, *then* running away is probably a
good idea. Invulnerability = drop aggro for 18 seconds, allows tanks to
regain aggro.

So: MOB beats on you. Cast DA. Back off. Tanks regain aggro.

But do NOT let it drop early unless somebody DESPERATELY needs healing.

Admittedly this is a very special circumstance, but I've had it happen to
me (usually when I've been chain stunning).
