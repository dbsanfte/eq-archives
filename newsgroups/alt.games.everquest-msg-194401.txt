This is not the BEST, but if he's patient he might try the Wandering
Greenblood ogre shadow knights (?) in southern Butcher Block
Mountains. They may be a bit tough for him to solo at 9th or 10th and
I can't say that the xp is super as I found the plat rewards to be
nice (ogres often drop an insignia worth plat and a 2h sword worth a
couple of gold, forget the severed fingers). He can also beat on the
nearby Green Goblins -- sometimes their outlying/wandering shaman and
wizards buff the ogres -- their heads and blood also bring plat but
the valuable drops are only low reasonable to poor. There are scarabs,
basiliks, and bats around for xp but may prove to be a handful until
he levels a couple times.

Note that the Green Goblins are different from the nerfed Aqua Goblins
whose similar drops bring silver not plat. In addition, he should keep
an eye open for, since the latest patch, the greenbloods seem to come
in closer succession from time to time meaning he might have to fight
two or three if he's not careful.

If he has to heal, the dwarf guard house by the cross-roads sees a
wandering greenblood (kind of slow) come along the trail towards it,
so he can take a few chances since guards are practically at his back
there and if he's too close when he engages will enthusiastically come
to his "rescue".
