Hopefully those factors are scaled down. I think this sounds like
*great* fun and sort of hope it shows up on the regular servers. But the
mobs were made so powerful primarily to overcome the fact that their AI
is nowhere near a humans. To let a regular person play a mob, I think
they'd have to scale back it's abilities to match.

Playing an Orc Centurion in East Commons:
"Hey! You guys over there! Yeah, you! Ok, look. There's five of you, and
my friends here are apparently about as bright as a box of rocks. Yes,
I've got the slashed belt. You want it? Fine! Take it! I don't even have
any fucking pants! I'll just drop it here and stroll off towards the
zone. AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
