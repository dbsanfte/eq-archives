Hi all,

I have a lvl 35 high elf cleric. I've decided to make it my main 
character and I've stripped my alts (which I no longer wish to play).

I have Thunder Etched Gauntlets on my cleric but have sold everything 
else. I have 80kpp to spend on equipment.

What would you buy and how much would you spend on it?

Any advice/tips would be greatly appreciated.

John
