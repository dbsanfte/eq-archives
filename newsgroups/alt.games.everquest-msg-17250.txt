Nope, you're not gonna make 20pp with baking. At one time you could make
decent money selling to vendors but Verant nerfed that. Tradeskills really
cost more than they return. Baking is there for fun.

One thing you could try. Get yourself a small sewing kit. Kill large/giant
spiders and make silk swatches from the spider silks. Swatches typically go
for 1pp each which isn't bad.
