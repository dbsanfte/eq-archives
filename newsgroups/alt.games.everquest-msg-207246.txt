	Thing is, Mr. Sisson, the DAoC crew was not inexperienced.  They'd been
running commercial muds for years.  I played in one of their early efforts
(Dragon's Gate back on GEnie.)

	These games are pernicious.  Designers get too attached to their work,
refuse to kill their darlings and start trying to prove their theories are
right and the players are wrong.  (That's Koster in one sentence. :-)  I think
Blizzard is one of the few design houses that won't fall into that trap.
These guys once killed their own product because they realised they couldn't
do it right (Warcraft Adventures).  Most houses, especially the big ones, will
push out damn near anything if they think people will buy it, never mind if
it's any good.
