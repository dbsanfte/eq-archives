> Don't try for Trueshot till you have 200 skill level.

Well that depends on how prepared you are to gather the materials and how
badly you want a Trueshot. There are easy ways to get stacks of Wire and
Shards, it is only the hassle of collecting the Micro Servos that is the
hold-up, much easier if you are getting XP while doing it! Even the Planing
Tool is returned on a failure, so the cost is only 12pp per success. I made
my first Trueshot at 103, on the 6th attempt. I reckoned to make 1/6 up
until 150 skill, 1/3 between 150-180, 2/3 between 180-200, and 5/6 at 200+.

> I have tinkered fletch mod

Good idea! But it only affects your chances of a successful combine, not
your chances of a skill increase. To maximise your chances of a skill
increase, get your WIS as high as possible (actually WIS or INT, but as a
Ranger you are a WIS caster so should have higher WIZ anyhow). There are
several cheap items that can help with this, just wear them for Fletching so
you don't worry about lost AC or other stats.

When you get going on successful combines, they are one of the few
profit-making items for Fletchers, still sell for 200pp on my server.

Good luck!
