Just wanted to share, I had my lvl 6 berserker in BB lvling and a Druid
comes over and reads my profile window which says "Any buffs would be
appreciated". He then casts a lot of high lvl druid buffs on me including
shared wolf form. Over the next 15 min about 10 ppl ran up to me asking for
SoW and calling me noob for not casting it on them when I repeatedly told
them i was a berserker and to do a /who on me.  lol  just gave me a good
laugh everytime it happened ;p
