May have been, I lost track of all the fears and charms my pet and I went
through that night (fortunately they seemed to favor fearing my pet away,
rather than using charm and making my own pet kill me)... it was very odd
though, after a few seconds the fear icon was still up and all the minos and
muddies conned indifferent to me, but I could walk around normally (no
spells though, all gems grey). Possibly strangest of all, of course, I was
almost fully healed.

I guess I should have bugged it, but at the time I thought it was one of
those bizarre one-off occurrences.
