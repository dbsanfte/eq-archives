There is a Sullon-Zek message board up where they discuss these
issues. 

www.sullon-zek.com

The points made in favor of Evil are:
1. Starting cities closer to most popular dungeons
2. Starting cities more isolated (safer leveling up -Especially for
Iksar)
3. Class selections more powerful in general for Evils (they get all
classes except Ranger, Druid, Paladin)
4. People who do not want to play Evil will be split between Good and
Neutral. This almost guarantees them a 2-1 advantage for Evil in
numbers.

I saw more "Evil" Bards on Sullon-Zek than any other Class/Race
combination in the Newbie area of FreePort.
