I was having frequent trouble zoning into SH from the Bazaar well
before the patch. It would often dump me to desktop. Once I did zone
in ok except that when I got there the entire environment was gone.
Pitch black. Nothingness. Except for every NPC in the zone - clearly
displayed at their correct location (z-coord and all) and facing the
correct direction. There were merely no walls or other objects to
obstruct my view. It was way wierd seeing them all just floating like
that. I managed to roam around a bit by feel and it all suddenly
appeared after a minute or so. Very strange.
