That SK isn't in high end armor. He cares enough about equipment to be
at the high end of what you can get w/o raiding but probably not
Ornate caliber. I'll check tonight to see what his AC/hitpoints look
like. 

Any idea how much mobs mitigate slow?

Hmmm, I've been assuming that pacification wouldn't work at all on
hard. The occasional resist on pacify might not be that big a deal,
having to succor occasionally or even run to zone might be doable
since we wouldn't really be worried about winning.

Heh, that would be a large part of the appeal of doing those
adventures.

Yup, I'm just trying to gain as much info as possible before I lead
the lambs to the slaughter <g>. Might be worth waiting until we get
some LDoN upgrades and a few more AAs though, that's the part I'm
trying to figure out. 

Thanks for the info,
