Best solution is to bring it up (as tactfully as possible) in group

chat and resolve it there.  If the Cleric insists on playing games
with the tank's HP then don't group again with that Cleric.  I took
a death in Miragul the other night because the Cleric was getting
cute with my health, but she took my death as a lesson and I never
got close to dying after that.  I vented in serverwide.age, but said
nothing in group chat as there were a few "what happened" comments
from others that I figured would be adequate, and they were.

I can't imagine eating three deaths in the same group that way, two
is one too many (I can sort of see one if the Cleric is unfamiliar
with the tank and/or the mobs, but after that there's no excuse).

Had I been you, and had I actually let it get as far as three deaths,

I would have announced that I was leaving and anybody other than the
Cleric who wanted was welcome to a ride out.  At any rate, I would
advise you not to group with Clerics who are more concerned with short
term mana conservation than keeping the MT alive.  That Cleric is an
idiot.  And an inefficient idiot to boot, given that rezing, healing,
and rebuffing the tank costs a lot more mana than the fool was saving
(not to mention dealing with finishing the fight after you've lost
your MT).  Put that dingbat on your "do not group with these idiots"
list and don't ever remove him/her.
