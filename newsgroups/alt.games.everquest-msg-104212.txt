Let's see - for the mage epic, let's look at the individual pieces -

Droppable Crown (from air)  100k is the going rate
Quillmane's cloak  20k (MQ)
Earth staff - saw a multiquest offered for 25k

Given that you need a drop from Phinny and another staff
from hate - I'd say no less than 250k for a mage epic
(if it was droppable).
