That won't work for what he's asking.

He's not asking how to get out of the Track window (bringing
up the inventory also drops the Track window, FYI), he's asking
how to get it to stop saying, "mobname is ahead and to the
right" forever and ever.

I've never found a way other than the aforementioned "bring
the track window back up and hit the cancel button".  Well,
or kill off the mob.
