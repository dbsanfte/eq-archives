3 practice points is nowhere near enough.  You want to get the skills up to
around 40 or so.  FD you should practice constantly.  ID will only go up on
a succesful check.

Other notes...FD only works if you are not attacking.  Make sure to turn off
attack.  ID will only work if none of the special attacks are greyed out.

Hunt Well
