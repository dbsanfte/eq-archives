Did you actually read your own post from start to finish after you wrote it?
You remind me of those people who shoot themselves in the foot and then go
after the gun manufacturers for making a dangerous weapon. Umm, last time I
checked, EQ was a voluntary thing. No one is forcing you to play.
Other that the points that have been already brought out, you are forgetting
the one big thing about EQ. It was DESIGNED to be a social game. You're
complaining that the mobs are getting tougher. Wah!!! I've never been in a
situation where hunting for xp or for loot where if we put together the
proper group, we could not accomplish our goals. If you are a solo expert, I
can see where you may complain that the mobs are getting tougher. Again
WAH!!! Whether there are classes that can solo well or not just happens to
be how those PARTICULAR classes were designed. The game itself was created
to be social. It was designed so that you have to combine forces with others
to hunt effectively and efficiently.
