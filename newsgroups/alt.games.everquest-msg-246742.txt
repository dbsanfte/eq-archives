At a cost of just over $US200 for a very very good card it is a no
brainer for those wishing to upgrade for graphics that are DX9
compatible.

Not true I don't have this problem with my card.

The graphics business revolves around gamers in the main, this is where
there money is made.  I would suggest to you that most hardcore gamers
upgrade their systems each 2 years at most. In the case of the Nvidia
4200 and the rest of the GeForce 4 series now is the time.

Disagree with this ... I don't know anyone who willingly put up with
bad performance like this.

As long as you don't want to play games with it suffering the lag and
lack of visual effects that is fine.  If you do play games with it and
wish to have a substandard system that is also fine.

If you want the game to run even remotely properly the correct course
is to get a system which will handle it .. or complain which doesn't
solve your problem.

I am not aware that I did that .. the op asked for recommendations and
I gave them.  To fiuture proof yourself with DX9 games you will need a
card which can handle them .. that is what I have been saying .. atm
the only choice is the Radeon for doing this until the latest Nvidia
card hits the shelves.

Hands up those who want to play a first person shooter at 26fps .. come
on.

Oh rubbish ... I haven't had a screen set to 60Mhz for years and I
seriously doubt any of the players in this forum have their screens set
to that.I would just love to see some proof on this one.

I shall delight in remidning you of this statement when the new
graphics engine is implemented.  Let us not forget that we do not have
the new engine yet for EQ only a hybrid system.

If you say you have an Nvidia in your prime box I am going to laugh out
loud.  What card is in there?

I agree which is why I am suggesting a $US200 card is the way to go not
spending almost $US500 on the latest bunch.
