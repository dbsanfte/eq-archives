Looking at your screenshot, I'll give you a free tip.
;-)

(Shhhhhhh... secret "l337" tactic about to be revealed)

Psssst. You fight Naggy in the doorway. Not inside the lair. And leave
your clerics out in the prep room. Melee run back to clerics at 50%
health screaming "Jimbob Incoming Needs a Heal Now Please!" in the raid
channel.  Just pull the dragon up to the doorway and fight him there. If
you do it right, when he dies, his head will be sticking out the door
into the corridor. :-)

Leave your other nukers out there until the dragon is down to where you
call for nukes also. Saves them from most of the AoE crap and they wont'
be feared all over hell's half acre.

If you fight in the lair, you'll have lots of people feared into the
lava.  Very ugly.

Of course, the tactics change for every dragon. We did a spur of the
moment Faydedar raid last night for one of our druid's epic. Totally
different fight, but that's a tale for another day.
