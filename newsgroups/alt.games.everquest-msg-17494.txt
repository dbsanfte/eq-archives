With a melee weapon, Strength affects your chance of hitting and how much
damage you do; the only affect of Dexterity is how fast your weapon skill
goes up with use.  If you're weapon has a proc, then higher Dexterity will
cause the proc to trigger more often.

Your weapon skill also affects how often you hit and how much damage you do.
If you've just started using a 1H Slashing weapon, it may be just that your
skill needs to build up.  If you've been using 1H Slashing for several
levels, it should be staying maxed out by now.

Your Offense skill also affects how well you hit, but that should stay maxed
out by your level.

A Strength buff would help you hit more and do more damage; if you just
started using 1H Slashing, a Dexterity buff would help your skill go up
faster.
