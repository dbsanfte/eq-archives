First, to anyone else unfortunate enough to read this... sorry about the
tone but like begets like in my book!

NOW:  Education time I guess...  Wiz, Mage, Enchanter and maybe Necro are
"pure" casters Grae old boy.  Think you'd know that unless your just a
purpetual smart ass.

Ah cut off my hands for sure... typo even though my wifes Druid often was
around to SOW me since she was about 15 lvls ahead with her Druid when I was
in Oasis.

No, your pure BS!  You really don't know shit about EQ now do you!  See, you
get KEI in Nexus, then take the PoK book to PoK then.... Oh hell, whats the
use.  You'd likely only get lost if I tried to tell you how its done.  Hey
bozo, I don't raid!!!  Nor did I make mention of such a wasted use of
playing time, and camping???  Takes 30 secs., Oh you mean camping a mob
etc... no I don't do epics or "farm" so I don't "camp" either, sorry.  I
have a job so I'm not home by 2:30 in the afternoon to spend endless blocks
of time sitting "camping and/or raiding".   Trip???  no, sorry again I'm not
into drugs.  I LEVEL, thats what I do and once a group starts forming I can
get to nexus, grab a KEI and be back to Plains in 5 min. or LESS!  See, I
use this thing called "Gate" to get to nexus... it directly teleports me (or
I have my Wiz there on other box and TL Shaman to nexus) to the bottom of
the West stairs.  See there are 4 stairways leading up to a platform... ah,
never mind, whats the use.  Ah, someday you'll learn a little something
about EQ and you'll discover something called "extended KEI" which can last
up to about 3 1/2 hours and usually 3 hours.  No, after 3 hours in the
plains I'm ready for a little down time between KEI's so I'll just give a 10
or 15 min. advanced notice that I'm leaving once the old KEI starts flashing
and maybe look for another group a half hour later or go somewhere else for
a while UNLESS the group decides it could use a little break too and wants
to wait while the casters get a new KEI which I'm sure you'll never find out
first hand, happens quite often!

You really are a moron arn't you!  Its canabalize you idiot and I don't, nor
have ever consumed my HP's at a rate of something like 3 to 1 for mana, nor
will I ever!  Even before KEI, and if you could comprehend what you read
you'd have realized that I said I didn't start getting KEI until my Shammy
was in his high 40's which means I was in DL dork, I never used canabolize.
Why would I consume my own HP's knowing full well I'd likely get hit after
slowing mobs (see dorky, I slow the sec. I can to save the melee's HP's
since there the key to the groups survival, soI'll often take a few wacks or
more) and the last thing I want to do is drain the healers mana regen'n my
mana!  I can see I'd stay in a group you were in for about 5 min. before
leaving but hang in there and you'll learn about EQ.  Canadancing....
gezzzz.. whats that, some perverted Bard dance or something!  LOL

LOL, my God your are an ignorant ass who obivously knows nothing about
higher level Shaman or any other class.  HOS costs 450 mana a pop, group
regrowth costs 600 a cast, our best DOT which does 1720 dmg in 45 sec. costs
375 a cast and our slow is 325 mana I believe or something in that ballpark.
Considering at least the Melee's (usually 2 in a Plains group dorky) want
HOS, and if no Druid is in the group the Claric appriciates regrowth if hes
10 IQ points higher than you that is and everyone appriciates slow.... that
slows the mob so it dosn't hit... ah never mind.  So dig out your Nijina
turtles calculator and do the math dorky.  Oh now I could always refuse to
cast buffs or I could buff everyone and then sit on my butt for 5 to 8 min.
med'n mana while the group regrowths 25 mins. tick away.  That makes sense.

Before KEI there wasn't a PoP dorky and I can well remember times in KC
sitting hoping I'd have enough mana for patch heals because the Claric was
at 1m or worse and our puller got 2 adds on their way back to the group and
the Melee's were getting pounded.... usually a result of a monk too, Ah,
thats it!  you play a monk!  Now I understand!  Cana slot for a nuke... what
an idiot!  I'll bet you use the word "why" a lot don't you... no question
make dorky cause its a retorical question.
