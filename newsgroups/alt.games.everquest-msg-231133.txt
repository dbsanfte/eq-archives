Jan 8th 2004

    About 6 months ago I was huge into everquest I had all the
expansions including Loy, just after it was released. I loved the game
and at the time I was living with my folks I had the game on my credit
card, and I let the subscription run out because I moved and was no
longer able to play the game because I did not have a computer.  Well
I got a new computer and I'm living at a new place, I was just
wondering if I got my folks to ship me my Everquest disk's will I be
able to reactivate an account I don't have the same credit card I had
before but I would be using the same User-name and password will this
be a problem to use my old disks or will I have to Purchase the game
again.  Thanks for all your help in advance

Tess
