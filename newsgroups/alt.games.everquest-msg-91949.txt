The kromriff guy is a "special" mob, obviously. He is meant to not be
killed so hits that hard and has that many hp to attempt to keep
people from killing him. Meanwhile, he is level one so he won't attack
you while you give him dwarf heads in various ways to raise faction
(if your faction is high enough you can give the heads, have friend
invis you before completing the trade, complete the trade then and
voila! quest done) I think his being a level one con is in
recoginition by verant that people will want to do the invisible trick
right by him, otherwise when you COULD do the quest he is not kos
anyway.
