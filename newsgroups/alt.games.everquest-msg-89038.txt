I played on a PIII 600 laptop this weekend.  it had Windows XP Pro, and EQ
on it along with Office XP.

I installed Luclin, and played over a 56k connection.  It was the most
brutal experience I have ever had playing a computer game.  constant disk
access, pauses up to a minute when turning a corner, up to 5 minute load
times....granted I only had 90something MB of ram on the machine, but I did
not load ANY of the new textures or character models.

It was horrid.  And that was just in Freeport.  North Ro was slightly
better, but I did not do *any* adventuring.  It was a test.  Horrible.  I
turned off the 3D sky, and turned everything I could down to the absolute
minimum res or effect off that I could, and it still chugged.

My advice is, if you are dead set on getting a laptop and playing EQ on:

pack as much ram as the machine can hold.  Get the absolute biggest hard
drive you can, and the best video card you can put in there.  Pray.

good luck.
