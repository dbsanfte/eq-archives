I spend quite a bit of time there since it went live. The exp. gain in
there is awsome for a 28 Paladin. I am able to solo the entire zone (in
the kidnapped version that is). I have made several gold from the chest
that have dropped. 

I also love the way the zone scales to your level. It would be nice if
their were more zones that did that.
