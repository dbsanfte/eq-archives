...?

As opposed to feign, snare, root, shadowstep, heals, mana regen and
self-evac?

Gimme another, these are too easy.  :)

Anyway, the thread of the discussion was that beastlords always get the same
level pet, why not magicians.  The comment was made in followup that
"Beastlords are pretty much red paste without their pets" as justification
for why they always got a pet of the same level, in response to a question
about "why not magicians."  Undeniably a truly *bizarre* way to answer a
question comparing beastlords and magicians, as if a beastlord is "pretty
much red paste" that means a magician has been paste for the past 10 minutes
and is halfway back to their corpse by now.
