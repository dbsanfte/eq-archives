There are several tradeskill recipes in the game that create multiple
items which don't stack.   (Well, there's at least one.)   And a lot of
recipes produce multiple products which don't stack, either.  Take the
cases where you use a tool - like, oh, a pie tin - to create an item.  You
get back the created items *and* the tool, which obviously -- since they
are different items -- don't stack.

I doubt they change it though:  VI has a vested interest in keeping
tradeskills time-consuming to master and practice.
