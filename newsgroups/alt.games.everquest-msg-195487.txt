Yes, it really grabbed my attention in a way nothing else in your
post did.

Sorry, I don't give a damn about how unbalanced twinks are.  Fix
twink balance by fixing the items that are used to make twinks, not
by skewing the hell out of the game for everybody else.  As for
non-twinks acquiring them, even at 30k (on Tunare I never saw one
under 40k) there were very few players with a single account and
a melee as a primary that could have bought one before their mid-50s.
Let us not forget just how gear dependent melees have always been,
how many melee mains did you know with even 10k at a level where a
fungi would make a big difference, let alone "in their early career"?

Do you have any idea how difficult it is for your typical untwinked
melee to acquire 3-4k worth of gear by L30?  Compared to a caster
who can easily do that before L20 _without_ KEI (I've done it twice).

No sir.  You raised the red flag, and like any good bull I obliged you.
by charging.  You aren't even the first in the thread to suggest that
KEI as it is implemented is somehow justified by the fungi.  And it
wasn't just the word "fungi", it was "fungi ... early career".  I just
can't consider an extreme twink's early levels as having anything to do
with a "career".  If you're wearing 100k+ (or 40k+ or 20k+) worth of
gear, your "career" doesn't begin until your mid-40s as far as I'm
concerned.  And judging by the PLing done to most such twinks their
players do not disagree with me.

That is not what I am intending to say.  What KEI does is to exacerbate
the already substantial imbalance between casters and melees.  And it
does so in such a way as to pretty much destroy much of the fun of the
sub-50 game.  Keep in mind that I have deliberately done most of my EQ
playing with sub-50 characters.  The part of the game that I, and quite
a few others, most enjoy has been turned on it's head, shredded, soaked,
burned, compressed, and used for compost.  It sucks.  It isn't just the
soloing I'm talking about.  It has hugely impacted grouping as well,
and also changed the dynamics of choosing between grouping or soloing
for a given play session.

I agree completely, tho it probably isn't particularly obvious from
some of my posts on this topic.

Heh, wouldn't that be a "jealousy buff" you're describing there?

Yes.  Exactly.  Completely and unqualifiedly correct, imnsho.  & etc.


<snip the nasty bits> 

I do thank you for holding back on the invective until you got to
the part of my post where I became a bit, er, overwrought.  I'm
guessing you won't mind me allowing you the last word in that
particular area of this argument.
