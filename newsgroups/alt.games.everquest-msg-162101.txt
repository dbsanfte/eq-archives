My guild:

one point for attendance, taken at time/place posted in /guildmotd. Done to
encourage we have enough peeps online at a specific time to DO a raid.

each major mob has a point value assigned; if you are present at it's death
(whether you are deaded or not) you acquire dkp

each possible drop has a point value assigned.

after death of mob, and the announcement of the item up for bid...anyone may
/tell the raid leader who desires that item for the posted dkp. I.E. Blade
of Carnage, 20dkp, send tells to Xfire now!

person with most dkp on the books gets the item. if no one bids on the item,
it is an open bid for all members IF it is nodrop. I could, for example,
send in a tell bidding 8 dkp on the BoC. If no one outbid me..I got a great
deal ;)

if the item is tradeable...there will be no open bids. the guild bank will
sell it in bazaar.
