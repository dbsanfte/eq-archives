Apologist my ass. Look, I'm not saying they didn't fuck up. I'm
annoyed by it, too. However, faulting them for YOUR OWN FUCKING
ASSUMPTIONS is purely assinine. Yeah, maybe it was a logical
assumption, but it was still an assumption. Logic would also tell you
to look in the forums (Where they do the most communication with
customers) if you don't see the updates in the patcher window.

I'm also taking issue with the idea that Blizzard would have handled
this better. First weekend of WoW's open beta: Servers were fucked up,
wound up crashing completely. We heard exactly jack shit for hours.
Then we heard once that the servers were down and being worked on.
Then nothing until someone finally got Kay's attention ON HER DAY OFF
and she got on the phone to beat heads to find out what was going on
so she could give us some word, even if it was just "working on it, no
ETA". That didn't happen until well into the evening. And betas are
usually when the devs are BEST at communicating with players.

Don't get me started on Artifact, Gravity, and Ubisoft....

Congratulations, you're a fucking troll.
