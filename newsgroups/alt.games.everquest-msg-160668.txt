	He seems to have a lifespan measured in minutes, though.  If a VT raid
doesn't do a drive-by on him on the way in, seems to me that someone else will
kill him long before he becomes a problem.

	Slopes are as good as walls in most cases; your arrows will path into the
ground.  However, as Davian has already said, in the only RC fights I've been
to he's pulled to zone and pinned.  Usually cornered, which completely buggers
any attempt to use archery on him.  (If a mob in embedded in one wall, you
might be able to squeak by if you embed yourself in the same wall.  Doesn't
work if he's trapped in two.  Or if there are hostiles on the other side of
the wall....)
