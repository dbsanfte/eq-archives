That may be partially true.  There is a con system in place right now
that is useful in Pvp. There has also been a strong surge in support
on the Vault boards for removing it for RvR. This would make a person
unable to simply selectively target greens and greys.  On the other
hand I have seen at least three "even" battles so far in terms of
numbers. I obvioulsy didn't have time to con both groups but they all
appeared to be in their 30's and 40's.
