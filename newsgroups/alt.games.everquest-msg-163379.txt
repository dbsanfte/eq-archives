I'm quite curious as to where this "proper netiquette" is documented.
And as for it being "decided on"  This is not a moderated newsgroup.
If it were, such a decision could be in place.  The moderator would
tell me to use a particular style.  This has not happened.  I use the
style that I think is best.  I would think that this mythical "proper
netiquette" would most likely frown upon such as branding someone a
"noob"  Maybe that's more of a common courtesy thing than a "proper
netiquette" issue.
