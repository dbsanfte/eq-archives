Aye, I was trying to think of a good substitute word last night and came 
up with 'effective'.  But versatile might make the point even better.

Yea, that's another thing that has the reverse effect for enchanters...
On a raid, there's 4 debuffs enchanters have that are the top of their 
lines, stack with each other, and may arguably be worth casting on the 
mob.  So I join the enchanter channel...  Enchanter1 says he'll tash, 
Enchanter2's gonna cripple, Enchanter3's gonna weaken, and that leaves me 
with Asphyxiate.  So we each have 7 slots left, or 6, since sometimes we 
double up on cripples if the mobs have high resists, and there's no reason 
for us all not to cast whichever DoT we most believe in.

So with a tiny bit of planning, there's plenty of room in 8 spell slots.  
At least for enchanters.  On raids. :)
