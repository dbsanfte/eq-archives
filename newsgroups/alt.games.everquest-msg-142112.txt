Nor does it change the fact that anybody in the US can act to change
those laws.

Where has total, unregulated capitalism ever worked on a large scale? 

And, for the record, I'm not for socialism, capitalism, fascism, and
certainly not communism.  As I said before, I don't think that there
can every really be a perfect, or even a really good government until
we can come up with one that doesn't involve people at all.  Which is
kind of impossible.  Best you can do is pick between the lesser of
evils, for lack of a better term.

Hardly. It was possible to move between castes, but for the really
poor it was very, VERY difficult.

What word is more suitable for describing the disparity between the
rich and the poor during the industrial revolution?

I'm not talking about now.  I'm talking about 100 years ago.  Now, yes
we do have a very large middle class, and I think that's a very good
thing.

After almost 150 people died.  Before then there was no regulation on

Upton Sinclair, not Sinclair Lewis.  And, yes it is good to remember
that Sinclair was a socialist and is coming from that POV, but book
did still paint a very accurate portrayal of what your average worker
had to put up with AND what you could hope to find in a turn of the
century meat packing plant.  As a matter of fact, THE JUNGLE was
accurate, or at least inflammatory enough to cause a government
investigation and a reform of food laws.

True.  But what do we do in the mean time while we have very imperfect
people.

Socialism isn't a bad form of government, on a very small scale.  It
doesn't scale up nicely though.  Socialism couldn't, all alone, work
in a country the size of the US.  That's why our current government is
a mix of capitalism, socialism, and democracy.  Each one takes up a
bit for the others weaknesses.  It's very, very far from prefect
though.  It depends on people actually paying fucking attention to the
what the people we elect do, and doing something about it.  As it is
right now, It's a good turn out if we can get 50% of the registered
voters to show up to fucking vote.
