Yeah, I'd mentioned that as an option in the post wipe discussion.
(discloud lasts 6 minutes and does 1 damage a tick... great spell for
that)... one of the group was leery of dueling ... true noobs ;)

Unfortunately, as you noted, it requires more time to prepare. It was
just gross because of the colossal waste of time... we literally
wasted 8-9 minutes mezzed and charmed... and then another 5 after the
wipe getting back up again. (running to corpses, zoning [we had a slow
zoner], etc)

>Since you had a cleric, Stuns are also useful in that situation. 

Useful, but alas, not sufficient. At 22nd, I only have stun and holy
might, and both have fairly long recasting time (12 and 18 second
respectively).  Not enough to shut it down.
