Actually, it occurred to me after I posted that it really ought to go:
"I'm sorry, Teapray and Lenny have no reason to dislike you, but you
have yet to prove your trustworthiness to us" which ties right in with
Valien's suggestion that you use Lenny as a bouncer (he is an Ogre
after all, heh).

Also, though I have not played my druid much (made L15 less than two
weeks after FV opened, still L15 today), I have yet to receive even
a request for SoW on FV, let alone a demand.  Which makes it all the
more fun to give drive-by buffs and heals when I play him.
