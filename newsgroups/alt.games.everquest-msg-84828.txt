We used to have separate IP address until Comcast switched over to it's new
network.  We may have two different IP's in the future but for now it's just
the one that renews every 24 hours or so.  But it doesn't renew every 30-60
minutes and that's what our disconnects have been.  I have seen messages
posted by others with the same problem that have dial ups and dsl
connections.  Doesn't seem to matter what kind.  I hate this 'Let's just
pass the buck" problem solving that many companies have today.
