probably not bought. She is just grouping the way she might still be
soloing some which is to beat on stuff. Someone has to school her and
tell her that in a group without a cleric druid is the main healer
pretty much. The shaman is usually buffing and slowing the mob and
such so the druid can be the one who heals, sows etc.

Basically from level 20 up a druid should never be meleeing at all,
solo or in a group. Priest melee just suxxors. At level 55 my druid
bear pet (which is about level 25) hits better than I do. When not
healing or buffing or ensnaring mobs who might run, she should be
medding. If shes always full mana she can be beating on stuff for the
heck of it but if she is healing she probably won't be.
