I'll  try this one more time before I finally acknowledge that you seem to
be incapable of understanding the concpet.  Giving someone answers to their
question is not based on age, it is based on two things.  The first of these
is the quetsion; for example if someone asks how old I am they want the
answer that I'm 37, not the answer that I was born at 12:01 pm on Tuesday
March 31.  The second of these two things is a progression of knowledge.
Everyone, not just chidlren, needs to understand the basic concepts before
they can begin to understand the advanced concepts.  For any individual you
anwer in a way in which they will understand.

No, I never said that. What I said was that if they could pose the question
they had a curiousity about the subject.  I further said that out of repsect
for that child and their curioisity they deserve an actual answer-- no an
answer of "you're not old enough for that."

Other people have no problems with it.  Maybe it's your approach that is
making it diffifcult for you.
