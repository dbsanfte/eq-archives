The safe spots they are refering to where erea's that you could stand with
out attracting attention from the mobs.  Or in the case of EC a spot you
could stand and blast  everything around you with out them moving.  I saw a
couple people use that spot before.  CAn't wait to watch them blast 5 mobs
and run back to there spot expecting them to stop in there tracks once they
are there.  can you say Loading please wait.  =)
