I didn't play my druid or necro last night, but I did pull up my 43 SK. 
From his point of view, the changes made his little DoTs more effective.

He's plowing through mobs in Gunthak outside of the entrance to Nadox. 
Whereas before there were enough mobs in the general area to keep him 
occupied, with the new DoT changes he was having to pull from deeper in the 
tunnels once his normal pattern of mobs was exhausted.
