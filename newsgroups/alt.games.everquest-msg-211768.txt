Nope, if mobs rose Venril S., it would be a trivial faction to raise.
They don't raise it, outside of big dragons. 

The only way to raise it if KOS would be to perhaps use an illusion at
first/do an invis after the trade window is open, etc. You'd need a
ton of sarnak war braids for that quest.

This was the original Evil Race/Class complaint with the kunark
expansion:

You could lower Venril Sathir in MANY ways, in places that were
gateway areas to Kunark ( the dungeon zone in dreadlands) So a lot of
evils were upset since some were well on the way to ruining their
faction before they even really knew of the overthere zone, with no
real way of fixing it.
