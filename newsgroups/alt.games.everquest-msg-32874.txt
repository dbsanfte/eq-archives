So AFTER you do a private tell to the offender to stop it (and they don't),
AFTER you tell the offender to stop it in group say (and they don't), AFTER
you tell the group that you'll leave if the offender doesn't stop it (and
offender doesn't stop and the group doesn't say a thing or takes the
offender's side), you think I'm still obligated to remain with that group?
Sorry, that group's history and I'm not going to then help them get out of
that dungeon after all that.  I say good-bye after the next pull and gate.
