You're expecting too much. Desirable factions, in my experience,
*always* drop waaaaaaaaaaaaay faster than they go up.  Took our guild
forever to get most of us to max ally with CoV.

Last week we killed our very first WW dragons. Dropped four of them in
one outing. On average, members of the raiding party went from Max or
High Ally to amiable or indifferent. That's going to be quite a while in
Kael Arena to get that faction back.
