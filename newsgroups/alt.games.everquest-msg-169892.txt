Not at all; it was the statement...

"If you deliberately make yourself hard for your groupmates to
understand you do them a tremendous discourtesy and ought to be
booted from the group as a clear "message" in reply.  Non-group
social interactions in-game are a different matter, of course."

Where you seemed to imply that all groups should boot players whose
form of play doesnt conform to what you think is acceptable. The
emphasis on 'real time communication not unpaced leisure reading',
statements like 'Does your roleplay give me anything comparable to
the enjoyment of reading Twain's prose?' and 'I don't care whether
you <think> you're being offensive, if you act rudely or offensively
you <are> being offensive.' gave the impression of remarkably little
consideration for the playstyles of others, and an overarching
desire to see the people who 'offended' you booted from groups to
be sent the 'message' you desired.

Frankly, if you prefer Mark Twain or groups more focused around
real time efficiency, thats your perogative, and you can, and assume
do, go and group with folks who agree, but suggesting that anyone
you perceive as offensive is therefore offensive in some kind of
absolute way because their quality of writing isnt up to your
literary standards is what I found elitist.

Now; This being Usenet and all you may have been taking an extreme
position of how you actually behave, or I may have been making an
extreme reading of it. Certainly my replies were, to a degree, a
parody of your messages rather than a genuine 'kaev I think you're
scum' tirade (which I don't, by the way), and I tried to indicate
that to an extent with the sig line at the end.

I'm not telling everyone else to rant at you to deliver a message, for
a start ;) But, as for how I justify it, well, the same way as you. In
rambling diatribes in A.G.E.... how else?

Maybe. Your posts to me were characterised largely by an 'I dont
care what you think you're doing, or are trying to do, your playing
style doesnt entertain me and therefore you should fuck off, its
discourteous to behave in a manner that doesnt maximise my enjoyment
of the game', which appeared to be simply taking on the very thing
you later elaborate as your problem with it; placing preference on
your desires over and above those sharing a communal environment
with you.

But I can accept that was a mistake in my reading of it ;)

Mmm, yes, I am. Which was why I asked if you'd leave a group where
the majority were happy with 'nonsense speak', which is, I think,
a more clearly obstructive description of 'olde worlde' mangling
than I've ever actually encountered in game, but you felt it was
impinging on your enjoyment, or if you'd still expect them to be
booted to deliver the 'message'.

How do you match the 'I dont group with random people' with groups
that arent used to working together? Now I'm just confused. Are you
talking entirely about a hypothetical person you've never encountered
and would, hypothetically, boot from a group, or ... ?

Of course, I feel the same way - our difference appears to be in
what we'd categorise as 'elitist', 'rude' and 'self serving' ;)

Actually, no. I dont old worlde roleplay at all any more, although
the 'persona' of my character is still intact. Its a very long time
indeed since I pretended to be anything other than a person playing
a game, which is a shame, but is the direciton EQ has gone in over
the last 3 years.

Its not so much that I felt attacked personally, as took umbrage
at what I perceived as a call to further homogonise an environment
that, frankly, should be about rich, diverse, fantastic portrayals
of persona and story lines. A roleplaying game , to me, is precisely
what you claim it isnt; an excercise in amateur story telling,
fantasy literature, sharing of dreams and empathy, and while EQ has
gone a very very long way indeed from that sort of environment if
there are people out there who still want to play it that way I
dont see 'boot em from the group, they dont play the way I like'
as a particularly justifiable or valuable position.
