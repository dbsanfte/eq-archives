	Critical hits, and I believe that post-50 they have a chance for a "super"
crit.  I could be wrong.  Ask Kalya. ;-)

	Rogues probably should get a stationary target bonus with Throwing as
Rangers do with Archery, but their melee abilities are so over the top that it
would be a pretty hard sell to get the designers to give it.

	You need better throwing weapons:

	Forged Javelin: 7/33, range 205, wt 2.0
	Forged Velium Throwing Spear: 8/32 magic, range 205, wt 1.5
	Antonian Javelin: 8/30, range 250, wt unknown 

	Damage isn't as impressive as a high-end bow, but the range of these is
only surpassed by good bows with long-range arrows.  The last one is human
cultural and I don't think we have any smiths in guild who can make them
reliably (trivial not known, but the Antonian Longsword trivials around 140),
and the Velium one probably has a high skill requirement and requires
harvesting ore from CC, but any of our smiths should be able to supply you
with regular Forged Javelins (trivial at 82; I can probably make them with
good success myself.)

	Paladins AND Rangers both have to kill FAIRIES for their quest

	Got the co-ords?
