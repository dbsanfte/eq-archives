Though I am a war I kinda ask the same, in total I have succeded 5 disarms 
out of several thousands (prolly).

The first 2 disarms was when I was medium lvl and training disarm. Then 
after 30. april patch (or near that date) I actually succeded 3 disarms in 
a Nro adv, and 3 times in a row, but now I fail all the time. Skill = 200.
