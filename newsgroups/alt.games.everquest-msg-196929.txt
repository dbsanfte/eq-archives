Hi,

I am a Cleric of the 52nd season and I have a friend who wants to
start playing Everquest. I was thinking I could powerlevel him (an
Ogre Warrior) to 30 or 40 in a couple of weeks so we could start
grouping together. However, I'm having some trouble coming up with
some good powerleveling zones/mobs post 25. Here is what I have so
far.

1-15 East/West Commons (Spiders/Bears/Kodiaks)
15-20 Paludal Caverns (Phlarg Fiends)
20-25 ???
25-30 ???
30-35 ???
35 + LoY Zones (Gunthak/Dulak/Nadox)

Any sugestions would be most appreciated. I'm looking for zones with
minimal adds and (ideally) no runners (undead, etc).

P.S., please don't give me the spiel about how powerleveling is bad...
save your breath =)
