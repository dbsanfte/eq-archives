heh... I seem to recall it was 4 person groups in the begining (Eye of the
Beholder, Dungeon Master, etc)... and that it was more a question of coding
and how many characters a single player could handle.

But you're right... a 12+ person group WOULD just tear thru the early
game... especially if they're veteran players who already know how to
co-operate well. And just think what would happen if a bunch of Rangers got
together... massed archers is what allowed England to hold on to big chunks
of France in the 13th/14th Century. :o)
