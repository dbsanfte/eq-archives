Good shadow knights? Semi evil shadow knights? My shadow knight is an evil,
racist elitist, coldhearted, scheming bitch. I originally thought about handing
in bone chips and fire beetle eyes to the Freeport sewer guild so she could
train there but thought, why should she cater to the humans? Good races are fine
when they give her buffs or aid in groups and she will politely thank her
benefactors, but only other children of Innoruuk are really worthy of her
respect. And she'll gladly exploit humans softhearted enough to deal with her
(merchants like Murissa Sandwicher), but she'd rather kill them slowly and
painfully than go out of her way to gain favor with them.

She's damned good looking, too.

The goodhearted Teir'dal thing is pretty overdone IMO, but if you're going to do
it, I don't think there's a better way than ditching your guildnote and running
far away :)

If you want original, I have a hippie treehugger gnome magician. She'd worship
Erollisi Marr if that'd been an option for gnomes... and she kills only 'nasty'
things (animals are nasty too, if they go after her first)
