I know there are some NPCs that will give you a chest as part of your
newbie armor quests; is that what you're referring to?.  Some of the
newbie armor quests involve collecting pieces of ore, along with other
items (found either off mobs or bought from a vendor), then combining
them to make a piece of sheet metal, which you combine with an armor
mold (which you get from the same NPC who gave you the chest) in a
forge to make the armor.  You can often find pieces of ore on certain
mobs in the zones near your starting town; for example, ore for
Halfling newbie armor is found on goblin warriors in Misty Thicket. 

An excellent place to look up various quests is at:

(that's generally an excellent EQ site in general)
