I don't see how someone could fool them for long.  By now they probably
would have learned to log almost everything.  How much harder would it be
for the same system that checks to make sure you or someone else on that
server doesn't already have a character by that name, to also take that name
and your account serial# and log it in a database along with what server,
date and time it was created (and same for deleted too).

I think though if someone were honest, rather than just simply saying "I
can't/won't move you to a different server!", they should be educated about
the character transfer service and be given the option to wait until they've
went through that process if they'd like to go to a different server (stay
on this one and if you want to go back to a server other than your original,
use the character transfer service...so we only have to move your character
once).
