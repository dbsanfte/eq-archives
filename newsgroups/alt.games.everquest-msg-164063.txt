    People get bored fast. If a game doesn't have a "hook", it gets tossed
aside once the fad is over.

    They can keep releasing tougher and tougher stuff. It just won't make RP
sense. ;-)

    They would if you'd stopped increasing quality in Kunark!

    It's the norm for any game. Figure out the "trick", and the rest becomes
easy. In EQ, there's a compounding factor - even if you know the "trick",
you might not have the raw AA's/levels/gear to pull it off. It's what keeps
players apart.

    Nor can it. Take the trials in PoJ: as the people in my guild who have
done all of them can attest, the difficulty of them doesn't actually
increase much from trial to trial. There's one tougher one, one easier one,
and four that are in between. Guess which one has a line hours long to get
into, and which five are empty of players? Even though ANY of them can allow
someone to obtain the end goal of entry to PoS/PoV?

    The people who play these games are natural min-max'ers. They did it in
AD&D, they'll do it here. And once they find the "optimal" areas to go, and
this info becomes public, all the breadth in the game collapses and you're
left with people packed into areas never designed to hold that many. Even
the people who aren't min-maxers go to the same places because they don't
want to appear stupid, and the game promotes grouping with others.

    Length, on the other hand, cannot be skipped or ignored. If you want to
progress, you have to jump through the hoops of doing these X encounters.
Now you spread people out, based mostly around time played but also on other
factors like skill and determination. And content gets used until everyone
is past it.

    Exactly. Stopping the progression by saying "zone N+k is the final
upgrade, from there on in it's 'for the challenge' stuff" stops EQ.

    No, it's quite a brilliant design. Look at the large number of paying
customers. It makes no sense for a role-playing game, but I think most
people abandoned any beliefs that EQ is about role playing a long time ago.
Buy a new expansion, meet new races and creatures, and slaughter them for
their phat lewts - that is the EQ advancement model.

    "Time-starved power gamers" is half my guild. When the first people in
my guild hit 65, you should have seen how many people in the guild that
couldn't play that much flipped out. "You're leaving us behind! You're not
helping us! You only think about yourself!" Why the big drama-fest? Because
part of the guild had achieved a very visible state of power, and the people
who couldn't play as much had not but wanted it. We still have flare-ups of
"F off, I'm not 65 so I'm not raiding, I MUST BE 65 AND I HAVE NO TIME!"

    The numbers can always be made bigger. And as long as the game keeps
people with astronomically big numbers away from people without, things will
be fine.

    Never say never. Wasn't Kerafyrm supposed to be more powerful than the
gods? ;-)
