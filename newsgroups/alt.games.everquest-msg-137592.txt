    We've had a lot of guildmates lose random items to this bug and to the
mod rod bug. Some of my guildmates got their stuff back, some didn't - it
all depended on which "pool" GM responded. One person lost a lucid shard it
took her 20 hours of camping to get, and which had completed her set of
them.
