As others have said, the choices are really only Alteration or
Evocation.

Though I spend over half my time soloing (nothing beats quadkiting for
xp), I chose to specialize in Alteration. Heal, regen, snare/root and
port spells all fall into the Alteration category. It helps with
soloing (though not as much as Evocation) and is invaluable In a group
setting.
