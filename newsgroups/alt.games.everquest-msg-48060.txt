Until you make/buy cured silk armour I'd suggest you rely on hand to hand. If
you want to use a 1HB then the club you can buy in the monk's guild only weighs
5.0. Any other good 1HB for monks around are pretty much out of your price
range. :(
If you decide you want to use throwing weapons, it beats running after your
target :), then I recommend the shuriken (sp?). The shorter delay means more
than the extra 1 damage from the throwing knives. HTH. :)
