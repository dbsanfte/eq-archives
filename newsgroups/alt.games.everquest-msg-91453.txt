Hi All,

I have a new question to ask regarding my Iksar beastlord. I know I
can go to the Nexus from DL, but is it possible to buy my spells on
Shir Vahl? I really hate the trick of jumping from a ladder and trying
to get to the third floor in my guild in East Cabilis. I know the
danger is 10000x worse but just an idea, since I have never been able
to get my spells myself without someone else getting them for me. I
know it sounds silly, but I have made it through DL running several
times without dying from levels 30-35 so far.

Thanks
