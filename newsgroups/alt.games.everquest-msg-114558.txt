try working in a casino on a craps table sometime your customer service is
16 assholes at once with lots of money on the line and a boss bitching that
youre taking to long to describe a game that it dealers 16 weeks to learn to
deal and even then rookies are clueless for at least a year And then youre
not taking into account that there are a few different styles of craps that
have subtly different rules.  to add to it hundreds of superstitions about
why the dice roll what they do.  and thats a normal  night you ought to be
there on a full moon.  sorry bout the rant but just got out of work and its
mothers day and all the loons were out
