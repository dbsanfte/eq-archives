Sites like this exist, set up and maintained by players, who spend many 
many hours of their lives debating the fine points of such things.

In my opinion, all the information needed to make informed descisions 
about buying various items is already out there, with the exception of 
proccing items.  I've yet to see a really good breakdown of exactly how 
item procs work and an item by item list of all proccing weapons which 
can help determine the value of this sort of feature.

This is because the proc rate of weapons seems to be hidden, and we 
don't have a good handle on what influences it.  So all we can go by are 
compilations of large groups of samples that show how often a given item 
procs.

For example, I was once very excited about the Journeyman Walking Stick 
(I think thats it, its been a while), which is a 1hb that procs Tash.  I 
thought my bard would be very happy to weild such a thing; get in there 
and mix it up long enough to proc the debuff, then back off and finish 
off the mob using songs, working on reduced resists.  Turns out the 
thing tends to proc about once every couple fights, even with his dex 
pushed all the way up to the cap (255 or whatever that is, I forget).

Another example, Tunare drops a 1hb, Sap Encrusted Branch or something, 
which procs a snare.  My cleric was excited about getting that, because 
with snare I could fear kite... well, same deal, go in weilding that 
puppy and more often than not the mob's dead before it goes off... or I 
have to give up on it and pull a real weapon, because its not going off 
and its taking too long to kill the mob with the damned thing; I was 
going to put it away and bring out a summoned hammer once the snare stuck!

On the other hand, Prismatic weapons seem to proc reasonably well, and 
proc a buff which lasts a fairly long time; its worth equipping one till 
it goes off and then putting it away and going thru several mobs with 
raised stats.

I'm off topic, though.  My point is that regardless of what you might 
think about the value of various items, for the seller the question is, 
what can I get for it?  And your only question should be, how much will 
you pay?  If you'll pay more than the seller is asking, then buy, if 
not, then stop worrying about it and look for some other item you think 
is a bargain.

There's LOADS of information out there about how various stats, and 
particularly  damage/delay, work.  You need to take into account not 
only the stats on the item itself, in the latter case, but another, 
which is the bonus.  This bonus varies based on your level, but 
different delay weapons will have different bonus at a given level.

This means that while weapon X might be better than weapon Y at your 
level, it might be worse than weapon Y at a higher level, or at a lower 
level.  So you also have to take into account the level range of 
potential customers.

I can think of one weapon which used to be very popular for people under 
level 45; it had (in its time) a great damage/delay ratio... but once 
you hit 45, so you were no longer unable to activate its power, it would 
proc annul on you, removing 4 buffs every time it went off.  People 
would use it till 45, then sell it off to some new up and comer low 
enough to be safe from the proc.
