Moral standards mean that I take the good with the bad.  That's why they're
"standards".  If I choose to ignore all laws, that is also a "standard".  If
I choose to pick and choose which laws apply to me, well, that's hardly an
indication of high moral standards.  =)

Totally tangential, but I will disagree with myself on that last point, as
applies to the real world.  With a game, I accept it in totality, parts I
don't like included, or I don't play.  In real life, things aren't so black
and white, and not playing isn't an option, and there are laws that I will
refuse to follow (ironically, I feel *this* is a sign of high moral
standards, but that has more to do with the "morality" of the lawmakers and
my decision to adhere to a self-defined set of standards =).

Because you made an exception, and no policy change was mentioned.  Now,
it's quite possible that you decide that exception was made in error, in
which case accept it for what it was, favoritism (regardless of how you
felt/feel about the guy).

Ahh, ok, I understand the philosophy now.  The classic "family guild". 
Wouldn't touch one, and that's one of the big reasons.  Ambiguity is not an
appealing trait in a guild for me, but some people aren't as...  "focused",
for lack of a better word.  For one, it leads to situations like the one at
issue, among many other reasons.
