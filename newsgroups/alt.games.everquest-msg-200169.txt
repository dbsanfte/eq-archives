I recently started a woodelf Ranger and thus I have collect many bags for
full of deathfist belts. Tonight decided I would turn them all in for the
faction, xp and coin, however I can not seem to find anyone who will take
these belts.

I have tried Deputy Bedu in Misty Thicket and Cain and the Captain in
Freeport. Every time I give them the belts they give them back saying they
have no use for them.

Can rangers complete this quest?
