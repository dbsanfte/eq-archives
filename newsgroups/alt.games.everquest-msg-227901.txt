Claiming victory after you were "owned" is...

So, you started raiding at level 1, right?  Or you were naked until level
50+?  C'mon, my "straw man" is alive and kicking right here, being
illuminated by your blinding hypocrisy.  :P

Nah, you've been shown to be a hypocrite beyond a shadow of anyone's doubt. 
I really don't care if you continue to spend time on it, because I've
watched and participated in this exact discussion with a few dozen different
people at a few dozen different times in the past, and the result is always
the same.  The people adamantly in favor of NBG are proven to be naive,
hypocrites, or both, and still they walk away proclaiming victory and
ignoring the fact that it just heightens their hypocrisy (or naivete). 
Fairly hopeless, but I do love to taunt.  :)
