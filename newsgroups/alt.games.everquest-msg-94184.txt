Because its only a bug in the text we are seeing. Its not a bug in a
faction altering way. They explained exactly whey they did not bring
the servers down, because the general feeling amongst players is that
they have been patching and bringing the servers down too much lately.
So in this case, they decided to wait until the time of an actual
patch to fix what is only a display bug.

I think the patch is today, thursday, so you won't have to worry about
it now.

I always wonder why more of this is not "hot"(as in not having to
bring the servers down) patchable.
