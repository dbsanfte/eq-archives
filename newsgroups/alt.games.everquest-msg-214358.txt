That sounds more like you didn't put any points intos WIS.

Others have posted some good suggestions for WIS items. I would suggest you
might want to look at a change of strategy.

Instead of buying a bunch of wisdom gear you may want to just buy an opal
encrusted stein for ~15 pp and try charming. There's some debate over
charisma helping with charm or not, but by now it shouldn't matter as you
should'nt be hitting for much with your weapon anyway.

The DOT/Root thing has really in vogue, but it isn't the most efficient. For
charming I would say try these and see if you like them.

Back the weaker. Pick something weak that will stay charmed a long time and
dump your dot/fear spell on something tough. I really mean even a green con
pet where you sic it on a feared red is great.

Back the stronger. Pick something that is an undercon and run it into the
ground killing everything in the area. A simple debuff spell, even flame
lick, will insure it wins big. When it breaks charm, kill it too.

Aggro kiting. Kind of simple really, just takes a bit of set up. Let's say
you are killing hill giants. Put a big DOT on the HG and start tracking.
Find a griffawn or griffene in the area and run to it. After the HG drops to
<80%, charm the griff, sic it on the HG, lay another dot on the HG. You
*DON'T* snare the HG, you just run around with the griff hitting him from
behind and maybe reapply another DOT if the first one wears off.

You can use camo/root to get the last ounce of experience out of a pet and
target. Goal is to get both to under 20% health. Let's say your pet and the
target are at 30% health and even fighters. You know the target will flee at
~19% so you root it. It now will fight to the death so you just wait until
your pet is under 20% and cast camo. Your pet goes wild and is now fleeing,
your target is under 20% and rooted. A snare or two and you have all the
time in the world to finish them off.

A lot of times things go horribly wrong. You get an add the same time
another mob notices you medding, just when root and charm break. You flee
into the path of another aggressive mob while dragging the first two over a
bunch of their buddies. When things go bad, it is still fun. Kind of like
managing a simulation/Warcraft. Worse case is you zone.
