  Trading isn't a "no no" on Firiona Vie, but opinions vary on who and how
you should trade on an "RP" server.  There is a "market" chat channel (/join
market)... the bazaar on Luclin so far seems to be the default trading zone
(makes sense.)  Currently, there is no language barrier on the chat
channels.  The server staff frowns upon using chat channels to get around
the language barrier, but it doesn't seem like something they are enforcing
against.  Also, if you join the market channel, it's a lot like being in EC
on a normal server in many ways.  I usually only turn on the market channel
when I'm passing through Luclin or doing a boring camp.

  A lot of people find buyers and sellers on this ezboard:
http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie ... in the Market Square forum.  In
city zones (including Greater Faydark) the /auction channel works, but most
people don't bother to use them, except the one in Greater Faydark and the
bazaar.

  It is extremely helpful to your advancement to join a guild on FV
considering how difficult it can be sometimes to find pickup groups, but if
you and your wife are only really interested in adventuring with each other,
it isn't really necessary.  I don't think a ranger/druid combo is a
particularly optimal configuration gameplay-wise... you share a lot of
spells and skills, so you lack some diversity.  A ranger/cleric combo, or
druid/paladin combo might be more effective (I'd lean towards choosing the
former).

  As for money... pretty much the same as other servers.  At low levels,
high quality bear pelts and lightstones are one of the better sources of
quick income.  You could also run over to the Warrens and fight kobolds
there... it's one of the richer newbie/lowbie zones.  Even lots of the lower
level kobolds drop bronze weapons, and they also drop molars which can be
turned in for ringmail (there's quests for this in both Paineel and
Erudin... you would probably be best off giving them to the Erudin erudites)
aside from being (in my opinion) one of the better low level dungeons.

  Good luck, enjoy the server. :)
