I believe Elrond's father was Earendil (human) and an elf (i forget the
name)

Illuvatar (sp) <- the god figure in middle earth , put upon the children of
Earendil a choice, to become mortal as a human, or immortal as an elf.
Elrond chose immortality and as such is numbered amongst the elves. Eros,
Elrond's brother, chose a human life (although many times greater than
normal) and became one of the first kings of the Dunedain (humans).

Therefore, although he is in fact Elrond HalfElven, it makes sense that he
looks like an elf, and in fact in the Silmarillion it says he is an elf, so
if it walks like an elf and talks like an elf, its an elf :)
