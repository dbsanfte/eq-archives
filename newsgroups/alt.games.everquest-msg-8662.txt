Sitting at work, downloading a new application, and the text on the
download message contains the phrase, "This application download package
includes a sefl-extracting installation wizard."
  So of course, I immediately think, "Is that some new level 40
discipline? Self-extracting sounds like a new evac spell, but
installation? What's that? Some kind of spell that takes the whole group
to a new location and immediately binds them there?"
  I played waaaaaaay too much this weekend. I'd take some time off, but
I'm only 2 yellow bubbles from 30.
  Just shoot me now and get it over with.
