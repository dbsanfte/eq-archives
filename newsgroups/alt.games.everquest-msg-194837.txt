Previous to the hell level smoothing, the xp to get a pre-50
level was:

Level^3 * 1000 * Race_penalty * (some_modifier)

where (some_modifier) is incremented a 25,30,35,40,45

This was the cause for the old hell levels.

So, the xp to get from level N to level N+1 is
((N+1)^3*R_P*S_M)-(N^3*R_P*S_M)

The cause of the hell levels was the fact that
if you incremented S_M from 1 to 1.1 at 30 (say) then
you have to make up that .1 * all your xp up to
the current level in addition to the the xp difference
from level 31 to 30.

Over 50, the S_M modifier goes up - it used to do it
in steps, hence the 54/59 hell levels, which they 
have also smoothed.

I don't know precisely how they smoothed it - but
if they made much smaller increments to S_M and did
it at every level, then the hell level xp to make 
up would be far less, and you wouldn't have the 
extradinary drop in xp requirements for the following
levels (compared to the hell level).  It would
just slowly ramp up.

So, if S_M simply incremented .02 at 30,31,32,33,34
then - by the end of 34 you'd have the same xp as if
it incremented once for .1 at 30 and then not again
until 35.  It seems reasonable that this is how they
smoothed the curve.

The big question is - precisely what is the progression
of this modifier as you level?  I'm sure the ShowEQ folks
figured it out (that's where I saw the original data on
hell levels, xp to level and xp per mob).

I'm pretty sure the first (old) hell level was around 1.1.
It seems to me that by 45 the modifier was 1.3 or 1.4.
I also seem to recall a post 51 modifier >2

General discalaimer - It's been a long time since I saw
these numbers - the precise amount of the modifier
at 30,35,40,45 is very hazy and all speculation on how
it works now (post smoothing) is just that - speculation :)
