In the short term, yes, but in the even shorter term you might look into paying
druids for SOEagle, which lasts quite a long time and tends to go for 5pp or so.
Then when that runs out resort to drinking your SOW potions till next time you
are in nexus/POK... except that as a wizard, heck, bind nearby, port back to the
source and get another SOE!

For movement purposes, especially grouped movement purposes, horses suck.  If you
need to move faster than mobs in a group, you need to be able to do so NOW
because you want to get away from a nasty mob or to kite it around in circles.
Horses accelerate slowly and corner poorly and have a nasty deceleration period
to them, so you can't easily stop to cast.

Medding without sit aggro is indeed one perk of a horse, but the other perk is
that you are medding while casting, while clicking, as well as while standing
around waiting for aggro to drop so you can sit (well you won't, can't even if
you want to, but if you didn't have the horse you would be)

Horse speed is only useful in long cross country runs, and if you always group,
then you'll be either grouped with other slow moving people, or with someone who
can cast SOW; if they are faster than you are then there's little reason you
can't be that fast too.  If they have TBoots or JBoots, you won't really fall all
that far behind in most travel.

Go after the OOT AC and its just a time sink, I'd never consider going after the
SRo one due to the constant KS fest this entails, but the OOT AC is a campable
spawn on a 6 minute clock, easy to claim and not that hard to take out in your
40s.  That won't get OP a speed boost now though, at 31 I doubt he can solo the
SRo one if he sees it pop and nobody else is in the zone, the OOT one is higher
level.

That said, JBoots are great, letting you be faster than the mob at will, even if
its dispelled, even if you are actively running.  Insta click is a huge advantage
over even the short cast time of TBoots, not interruptable and no need to stop
moving to cast.

These share with JBoots the massive benefit of always being faster than the mobs,
without constantly consuming plat and backpack space in the form of an endless
run of SOW potions.  But they do cost a pretty penny, and you'll probably be able
to find someone MQing JBoots for the same price more or less.  Trust isn't really
that big an issue, find a MQer who is in a reputable guild if you are the nervous
sort, heck, ask friends who have JBoots if they remember who MQ'd them, often
someone who does it once farms the ring and does it a couple times a week., and
they'll have no more reason to screw you out of your money than they would have
had to screw your buddy they helped earlier.  All they'd get is a few thousand PP
they would have gotten by being honest, and you'd certainly kick up a fuss and
smear their good name, making it hard to hook the next sucker, or honestly sell
other items they may come by for MQ purposes.

Course having said that, I have two characters with TBoots, having once done the
JBoots quest for a character long ago, I have to side with the "too lazy" part.
TBoots are almost as good as JBoots if you click them just before pulling each
mob, as long as the mobs aren't dispellers.

If you're a speedy leveler I'd advise forgoing the boots entirely in favor of
getting the Run AA in your low 50s, just drinking down SOW potions on the rare
occaision you need them.  But OP said he wasn't going to get past 51, and if he's
a slow leveler, he'll probably go thru far more cash on potions in the long run
then on either sort of boots; thats only 50 stacks or so of potions, after all.

Course on Firiona Vie, the boots themselves aren't "no drop", so you can sell
them when you get run, and can hand them around to your friends like passing the
peace pipe, everyone getting stoked up on movement speed whenever it runs low...

Bergh, 65 clerics with TBoots I haven't used since getting Run 3
Llyric, 57 bard with TBoots I stopped using when I got Run 2
Paax, 51 shaman who laughs at the thought of such slow boots while happily
polishing his shaman only insta click SOW boots.
