You smoking crack?
My druid can hold a krup without blinking.  Hell, worse comes to
worse, root/park, step back wait for tanks to realize, "duh, hey
there's another froggie here..."

Ummm, none of our tanks bother with riposte disc.  It's defensive.

The problem with riposte is this:  You trigger it, the mob loses
interest in you.  A few seconds later, it comes back REALLY pissed.

Level 55 discipline for warriors is defensive.  The reason you want
this is that you want the Rune to last a bit more than two pops from
VS or more than the duration of riposte disc.  With defensive, instead
of 200+hp per smacks, the rune is taking around 100 to 120 per smack,
meaning a 500+ hps rune can last long enough for the enchanter to
chain cast it.

Even if the warrior doesn't have defensive up, he has higher AC
overall, that means Rune on a warrior will last longer than a Rune on
a shaman of the same level.  That makes the warrior better suited to
"hold" VS.

So can a druid, rogue, paladin, shadow knight, bard, etc...

About the only ones that blow doggie dognuts in the tanking area are
them silly ass finger wigglers that keel over with a stiff breeze.
