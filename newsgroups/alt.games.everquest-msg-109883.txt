There's no sign that the MMORPG market is saturating.  So far, every
succesful MMORPG has not had its playerbase diminished by the subsequent
succesful MMORPGs.  There seems to be a lot of people out there willing to
play an MMORPG who, for whatever reason, are NOT playing, and each new
MMORPG seems to get much of its playerbase from those people.

It will be interesting to see if that holds true for new MMORPGs that are
sequels to existing ones, like AC2 and EQ2, or if those do cannibilize the
older game.
