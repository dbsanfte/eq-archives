Jesus!  You've gotta be kidding.  I just bought one from the stable boy in
Bazaar for about 60 plat.  Normally I don't buy this sort of stuff from
vendors, but for those who haven't seen one, they are 1 hand slashing 14 27
plus 8 to str and to sta.  Vendor or no, that looked like a good deal to me
and I bought it.  Maybe folks on the moon aren't as greedy as their
Norrathian counterparts?
