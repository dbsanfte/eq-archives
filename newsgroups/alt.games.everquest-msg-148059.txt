Hmmmm...what happens if you have under 800HP unbuffed, but are buffed to
above 800HP?  Will you die from that HT?

I realize that sounds like a dumb question, but when I first got Ice Comet,
and wanted to try it out on something, a Cleric friend buffed me up to about
1500 HP, and I cast Ice Comet on myself.  It did the expected 1110 points of
damage--and killed me.

Since then, I've never taken damage from a single blow or spell that was
higher than my base hitpoints, so I don't know if that was a glitch or what.
