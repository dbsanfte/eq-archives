Hehehe... thats cause there a LOT of noobs playing bought characters.
Or... noobs playing friend's account.
They KNOW what sow is but don't have a clue as to who can cast it. ;-)

I was in a group a while back in DL and we had this one nutcase
warrior that kept asking our chanter for a sow, even tho EVERYONE in
group including the chanter told him she was a chanter and could NOT
cast sow.  He kept that up all evening, he didn't  sound that bright.
After chanter left he started bugging the cleric for sow.. lol
