Some of them do. Some of them just don't want to do it for money. I
would say a LOT of people *could* be good actors but just don't have
any interest in doing it.

But in a RPG, pretty much everyone who feels like acting is going to
do it. It's part of the fun.

Roleplaying is acting.

You DO know what RPG stands for, right?

So you assume everyone is exactly like you?

If you regard your character as little more than a spreadsheet, I feel
sorry for you.

Not everyone is capable of acting even in an RPG. But the number of
people capable of it is certainly higher when they don't have to
perform in front of live people.

*shrug*

Potayto, potahto. Either way they are acting more than you give credit
for.

Which is irrelevant.

Then do it in an intelligent fashion, or I'll start treating you like
the two year old you appear to be. Repeating "why?" with nothing else
added is about as infantile as one can get.

What do you think acting is?

*shrug* You are welcome to believe that. Not all of us only hang out
with assholes.

Obviously they are roleplaying women, even if they do almost nothing
in game that could be seen as female.

You have an exceedingly closed or ignorant mind towards roleplaying. I
find myself wondering if you even know what it is.

Why?
