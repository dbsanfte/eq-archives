The part I like is stating "I simply don't agree that homosexuality
is an acceptable alternative lifestyle" equals me "hate mongering."

I don't want homosexuals to die, I don't want to see them beat down
in the street, I don't want them branded with a pink star and sent
to the ovens.  I don't even want them called names or ostracized.

I don't want Jews to die.  I don't want Hindus to die.  I don't want
Muslims to die.  I don't want Shinto-Buddist to die.  I do want
Scientologists to die (well, shit...caught me on that one ;-)  ).

I don't want atheists and agnostics burned at the stake.  I don't want
Protestants and Catholics who don't go to my church forcibly converted
or face execution.  I don't want to force my views on anybody (except 
my
kids, and then just until they're around 13 or so and can start to do
some thoughtful questioning of me and the Rev on their own).

At the same time, I also don't appreciate somebody telling me that a
belief I have makes me a hate-mongering neo-facist.  I think abortion
is the murder of a small human being.  I have the right to state the
fact, demonstrate orderly, fund anti-abortion political speech, and
in general disagree with the Choice crowd.  They have the same right,
and that's what makes this country great.  Neither side has the right
to use violence, just as neither side should dismiss the other without
even listening to maybe "why" somebody holds a certain belief.

I think homosexuality is a perversion.  I can state that I think so,
and my view has exactly 100% the same validity as Barney Frank would
have to the converse.  We can debate it, and disagree peacefully.
Heck, we can disagree loudly and shrilly, as long as we do it 
peacefully.
(I probably wouldn't even think homosexuality was _such_ a perversion
if I hadn't been in San Fran on business a few years ago and saw one
of the gay pride parades in person.  "Assless-leather pants and a
bullwhip protruding from your anus" isn't exactly a great "face" to
share your proclivities with the public.  I love my wife.  I love
having sex with her.  Lots.  Lots.  I mean, a whole f'ing lot.  But
I wouldn't bang her on a float in the Thanksgiving day parade. Sorry
for the aside ;-)  ).  I don't want my son to grow up and beat a
gay man to death.  At the same time I don't want my son to learn
about the best lube to use for double-fisting in 6th grade Health.


The think is, most Christians I know don't dismiss other people by
sticking a label on 'em.  I don't think I'm better than anybody on the
planet (ok, maybe I have better sense than to cram a whip in my ass 
;-)  ).
Subsequently, I don't hear Patricia Ireland speaking and immediately
close my ears thinking "pinkomanhatingtwat, pinkomanhatingtwat..."  I
just disagree with her.

I don't hear a liberal talking about how tax cuts are only for the 
rich
and that Bush will have old folks deciding between eating dog food or
taking their medicines and immediately dismiss it.  I do some fact 
checking,
and form my own opinion.  But James Carville is still one of my 
favorite
talking heads on TV, even if I disagree with him most of the time.

I think what it comes down to is the line in the preceeding post(s) 
that
got me riled up, summarily dismissing pretty much all Christians as
hate-mongerers and therefore not worthy of holding an opinion.  As 
stated
by a majority of the people in this country Tuesday, "Fuck off."
:-)

I say it with a smile because as long as liberal Democrats are so full
of their own logical genius and so smart that they can't connect with
us hicks and rubes, they will never win another national election in
the next 40 years.  As long as morally-adrift-on-purpose-because-man,-
morals-are-too-restricting-to-such-a-free-thinker-as-me crowd 
immediately
dismisses dialogue from anybody to the right of Castro as unworthy of
even hearing in the same air they breathe,  we will pretty much have
a Conservative House/Senate/Executive/Judicial government for the rest
of the next couple of generations.  As long as anti-religous zealots
won't even attempt to simply hear what a 
majority-Christian-population-
in-a-country-founded-by-Christians-and-immigrated-to-throughout-history-
in-mass-numbers-by-Judeochristian-peoples hold as important ideals,
then in 2008 I can go to bed at a decent time on election night.

Now pay attention, and I can tell you why.  When a group of people,
let's say for a hypothetical, um, liberal Democrats...when a group
of liberal Democrats from all areas of the country actually hold
in contempt members of their own freakin' party, that group of people
will NEVER accomplish anything.   Liberals, progressives, the elite
highbrow academians that actually HATE Christians and moral absolutes
are shooting themselves in the foot when they crap on some of the
things that their own "peons" hold dear to heart.  It's the fact
that some issues ARE important to many, many people...people who can
disagree amicably with others but get seriously pissed at being
dismissed intellectually when labeled as "ew, yuck, x-tians."

So pile on the anti-christian messages.  Laugh at a New York cocktail
party about all the morons in fly-over country. Demean the religious
folks throughout the nation because if they were just as smart as you,
they'd "get it."   We really don't matter. We're all just brainwashed
anyway, right?
