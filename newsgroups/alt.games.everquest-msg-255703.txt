Eh, maybe that cartoon doesn't convey the idea I was trying to get across 
as well as I thought.  Basically, if you're MT and successfully holding 
aggro, it should be your honor to go down with the ship when things go 
south, so everyone else can get away, and not to fucking whine about it.  
Same as it's my enchanter's honor to die yet another death keeping my 
uberhasted pooka from eating the rest of the group, especially whoever it 
is that's gonna rez me back to Tipt, or the even more honorable tashicide 
pull death.
