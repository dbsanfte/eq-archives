After waiting over 2 hours, I went in and used a totally different EMail 
address, made up name, address, etc.  This time I instantly got a 
response on the web page, instead of just a "done" message.

So I guess something went wrong the first time thru.

Checking my dummy email (mostly there to collect spam) I got an 
automated message within 30 seconds of registering.

Went and registered again with my real info, real email et al, and it 
worked the same way.  SO I guess out there somewhere is a year's account 
with my real info on it, but I can't get into it, which is fine because 
it won't ever be billed (and doesn't have billing info if there's a glitch)

Email, by the way, has nothing of note, unlike something I've seen 
frequently where to verify that the email exists and is mine, they mail 
something crucial there.  Apparantly you can enter any information you 
want, and as long as you come up with a unique user name you are in. 
(barring whatever mess I made the first time)
