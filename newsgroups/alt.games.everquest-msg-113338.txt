That's fine for factions where there *are* mobs you can kill to
raise the faction.  For others, though, doing the invis turn-in
was the *only* way to bootstrap the faction.

If this actually slams a door on some of those faction
groups, I'm *not* going to be happy.  One of my favorite
"take a break from exp-ing" hobbies has been to build
good faction standing with as many groups as possible.
It would suck if a lot of faction groups were suddenly
entirely out of reach.

Whether it's lame or not is debatable (personally, I thought
it made fine sense RP-wise * ).  But it was clearly
"working as intended".  For almost two years, the Paladin
"first epic" (Fiery Avenger, which is also a required
step for the new epic) *required* using this technique to
build DarkBargainers faction standing in order to do the
Book of Scale subquest.  (DarkBargainers start out KoS
to all Paladins.)

(*) I think it makes sense RP-wise.  An NPC hears
footsteps approach, but sees no one.  Several items
float out of nowhere and are placed in the NPC's hand.
The NPC responds, "I know not who you are, unseen stranger,
but I thank you for bringing me the items I have longed
seek.  Take this reward, and I also cast upon you my
blessing, so that when any of my people encounter you
again, they shall look upon you a bit more kindly."
