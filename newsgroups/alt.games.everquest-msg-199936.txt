I don't think so, It was like that before they considered the trivial
loot code, as far as I know.

Paineel was like that before the Warrens were ever around. Paineel has
never had vendors which store player sold items to later be sold. They
forgot to turn on whatever "switch" you need to in order for vendors
to do this when they built the zone, after that they never fixed it.
