I've been playing this cursed game on and off since 99', awhile ago I
created a warrior as I've been getting tired of running in circles and
wearing out my drums.  Anyhow, I've now got my tank to level 25 blowing
through Pauldral (sp?) caverns.

Now at 25, I'm wondering where is a decent spot for a tank to go and ideally
find a group?  I've got all expansions.

Next question, does anyone know of a good tank site?  I always hit
dotnetdiva and eqdiva for my bard as those sites have been instrumental (pun
intended) in my bard's development.

Lastly, I decided to try trade skills with my warrior and make my own
arrows.  I have the felt, er, fletching kit and am now making Class 2
arrows... however, is there anyway I don't have to add 1 of each unit
(knock, shaft, feather, head) to the kit and Combine to make only 5 arrows?
It won't let me stack groups of 10 to make 50 arrows on combine, but this
just seems painfully slow.... please tell me I am not going about it in the
most efficient manner.

Thx oodles!

Probis <-- 25 tank
Lionoo Meowmixlot 53 bard
Acril somethingortheother 51 cleric
Mofrugger  2 shaman
Spunkface 1 druid (just to see if spunkface would actually pass the name
filter! :p )
