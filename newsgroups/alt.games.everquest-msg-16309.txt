6 rogues with snare procing weapons, good instill doubt
skill, and Jboots

I know, depending on a proc is silly... until you figure that
six people with fast weapons only need a single proc to
kick in....

Depending on instill doubt the same... and the logic is
the same.

My preference (and a lot more realistic) would be Ranger
Cleric Bard Rogue Shaman Monk.  Not as good as the
multi rogue team for sheer damage over time, but a wide
array of talents, capable of dealing effectively with most
any situation.... and noone stepping on anyone else's
fire.

Fact that my main is a cleric might influence that, of course.

No way!  6 necros!  12 on one?  And its snared and feared?
Give me a break!  Mana won't be a problem, Health won't
be a problem, only problem will be finding prey fast enough!
OK, 5 necro and one ranger.

level 7 necromancer, Morel Thule

6 rangers with good bows.  Never have to move, never
take a hit, always have prey a plenty... and know what
its con is before you even think about it.
Aisle
8 ranger, Morel Thule
ps note that just about every group Lance comes up
with has a ranger in it.  That'll show him for taking a
cleric as his main
