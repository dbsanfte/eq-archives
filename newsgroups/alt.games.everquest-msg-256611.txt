Yes, but since the disease curing axes weren't used up as long as I had 
regular axes in ammo slot to use instead, I had nearly infinite disease 
counter removes.  I must have removed over 600 counters from the 
Impervious Beast I actually killed, because I was throwing one every two 
seconds for over two hours.  I bet 600 counters will take off any slow 
you can show me which uses disease counters (rumor has it bard slow 
comes off with cancel magic)
