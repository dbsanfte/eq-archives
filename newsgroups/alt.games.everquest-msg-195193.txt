"All this ends up meaning that a comparable level caster can kill more mobs
 and gain more EXP than a melee can this shows the imbalance in the game. "

Wizards and druids can kill 4 mobs at once, usually as fast as or faster
than it takes other characters to kill a single mob, thus gaining 4x the
experience in the same amount of time already, how does KEI change this?
they can do it a little fasterm yeah.  still quite a bit of downtime though
for the caster.

let's take that balance thing you're talking about.

Take a mob that hits for say, oh....80 a pop at level 40.

now, a melee going in with full armor, nice weapons, etc, etc....starts
beating on the mob and the mob on the melee.  they slug it out and the melee
comes out on top.  he now has to sit and regain health.  He uses bandages.
bang, up to 50% (or more, depending on class/level). casters have nothing
like this for mana.  say you get Chloroplast or better...HP Regen time down
to minimal.

Put caster in place of melee, with a fizzled spell and draws agro.  caster
can't get away....POP STUNNED POP POP POP, STUNNED, POP POP, caster is dead.

See, the melee's lifebar is red, the casters is blue.

you say they are unbalanced, but you haven't looked at all the angles.
Casters can't hang in a bar brawl, and melees can't throw spells.  it all
evens out.

KEI unbalances?  sure, maybe for the lowbies, that's insane but what about
Temperance or aego or potg?  with one cast of temperance and a 30 something
druid, you can take ANY character to level 17 in about an hour if you know
where to go.  tell me THAT isn't unbalanced.  that's with NO KEI on druid OR
the PLee.

breeze, clarity, KEI is for mana what the regen line is for melees.
