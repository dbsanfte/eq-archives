I would suspect you are losing mana that way.  Especially since it implies 
you're standing up while you hammer the button. :)

But, for example, I have spec Alteration maxed, and SCM3.  Generally, if I 
have 27% mana after a rez, with my gear on and rez effects faded, I can 
cast VoQ.  If I try to cast at 26%, sometimes it casts, sometimes it says 
insufficient mana, sometimes it fizzles away 5% or so of my mana (teh 
suck!), and sometimes it -tries- to cast (casting bar appears and counts 
down), then stops with an insufficient mana message, and suddenly I have 
24% mana where I had 26% a second ago... Bah! How did not being able to 
cast the spell cost me mana?

I think Canni takes a lot less mana, correct me if I'm wrong.  So maybe it 
puts you at mid-2% instead of high-2% when it fails this way.  Actually, 
that's really odd... According to Lucy, if I'm reading this right, Canni 
takes zero mana?  How can you have insufficient mana for canni?
