Your parenthetical comment is incorrect.  That's how it works for most
mobs, but there are exceptions, such as a couple of quests where what
the quest mob drops depends on whether or not you've done some of the
quest steps correctly, and since these steps take place after the mob
is spawned, this demonstrates that they can determine loot after spawn
time if they wish.
