Thanks Rob. The 1H blunt was just a bad example. Anyway, I still don't 
understand how to max a skill before going up a level. All that I 
currently do is use my spells fighting NPC's which increases EXP and 
eventually I level up, I then go and train some skills at teh Wizard 
guild. Is there some other way of increasing skills without increasing 
EXP ? Although that would be a bit strange :)
