Bad analogy.  This choice is more like one that already exists in
Monopoly:  pay the bail, or wait until you've rolled the requisite
doubles to get out of Jail.

Indeed.  And I, for one, consider that the tastiest carrot of them
all.

You've neatly dodged my question, but I suppose I owe you that one.

Which is an extreme that I implicitly disagreed with already, re:
trivial tasks.  

My point is that writing the exam or winning he olympic medal develops
(almost) nothing;  it *proves* what you've already developed.  EQ may
be giving some guy who skims the book faster levels, but what use are
they if he never steps up to the plate and proves that he's earned
them?

Ah, many an eloquent phrase has been spoilt by stoic literalism.

I think not, but equally I think we never shall.
