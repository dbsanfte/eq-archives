Well for the most part I really like the new female models. The silicon
market in Norrath must be hurting for supply!
However, it seems they nerfed the Asses!  The model makers moved
all the triangles from the ass to the breasts. All the females now look
like they have 60 year old droopy butts. Bah.

Is there no ass men working for Verant? Are they all breast men?
Did they even use real females as models?

Ok someone start a petition!

This post done with tongue placed firmly in 'cheek.' =)
