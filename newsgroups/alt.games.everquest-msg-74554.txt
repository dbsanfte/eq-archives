In the old world, you'll be KoS to guards in places where the light races
are based (Erudin, Qeynos, Freeport, Faydark and Kelethin areas). Most dark
races (ogres, etc) will be dubious I think. And of course you'll be KoS in
the zones where pretty much everyone is (most dungeons, etc).

In Kunark, you won't be KoS in the Overthere outpost, but probably are
everywhere else.

In Velious, everyone (with a very few exceptions) starts out apprehensive to
Coldain and Othmir, glares to Claws of Veeshan (dragons) and Kromrif (frost
giants), and KoS to everything else.

I don't have Luclin yet...

Faction is fixable in quite a few places to the point where you won't be KoS
anyway, it just takes some work.

At L12 you can bind yourself (nearly anywhere) and people you are grouped
with (but only in cities and a few other specific spots).

You get your first self-ports at L20 (Nexus, NK, GFay and Tox), then
Dreadlands, WC, Nek, NRo and WK at L29. Velious self-ports (Iceclad, Great
Divide, Wakening and Cobalt Scar) at L34 I believe. Group ports (and evacs)
come in at levels 29, 34, 39 and 44, following roughly the same pattern.
Translocates (which let you port a single group member to another zone
without going yourself) run from L39 to L49.

See http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Wizard for a complete
list of wizard spells and places to buy them.

As to where you load them, they have a fast refresh time so you only have to
keep them memmed for the duration of the port, then put back whatever you
had memorised in that slot before. Personally, I usually load a port/TL in
the slot I usually have Gate memmed, unless the port is particularly
dangerous in which case I may keep Gate memmed in case I have to leave
quickly :).

> 4.  What are hell levels?  What are the hell levels for Wizards?
>

Hell levels take roughly twice as much exp to complete as the normal levels,
e.g. for an Erudite wizard, L29-30 takes about 2.7 million exp, L30-31 takes
5.8 million, then L31-32 only takes 3.3 million. Hell levels happen at
levels 30, 35, 40, 45, and 51-59 (with 54 and 59 being extra hellish).

One thing to note about hell levels is that you don't lose as much exp
(relatively) for dying. Exp loss for death is about 10% of the exp need to
complete the previous level, i.e. about 2.5 blues normally, 1.75-2 blues in
hell and 5 blues (eek!) in post-hell (31, 36, etc).

I did have a link to an exp calculator, but it seems to have moved...

There is an 'issue' with wizards to do with usefulness to groups post-30
(their damage output doesn't scale the same as melees, and they don't do
much else). Someone people agree, some don't, the topic crops up about once
a month here usually :).

Personally, I solo a lot so it doesn't bother me anyway, and wizards are
still welcome on raids (and in fact mandatory for some).

You can tailor raw silk and some other types of caster-wearable armour (see
www.eqtraders.com for useful trade skill info). However, the market is
fairly small. Most stuff you'll actually wear in later levels will be
mob-dropped, +INT and +mana gear is generally much more useful to a wizard
than stuff like AC.

> 7.  I'm putting all my skill points in medatate, is this good?
>

No. You only need to put 1 point in meditate, it will go up pretty fast
anyway.

As a caster with a high INT, you only need to put 1 point in skills when you
first get them, then they'll go up fast enough just in normal use. The
exceptions are language skills (which you don't really need anyway), trade
skills (which after a certain level can only be raised by doing the skill),
melee skills (which you won't care about after L20 or so) and possibly
Conjuration. Wizards get only 2 conjuration spells before L29 (Halo of Light
and Eye of Zomm), neither of which are used much in practice, but at L29 you
get your first familiar spell. Familiar spells use Conjuration, and fizzling
repeatedly on a high-mana cost spell is not nice :).


www.graffe.com and http://eq.castersrealm.com have lots of nice information
on wizards, check them out.
