It will work, and from what I've seen, you can get two sessions in over a
28.8 connection without problems.  I live out in the country and my wife and
I share a modem line, which usually doesn't connect over 26400 :) It lags a
bit when one of us is zoning, but it works fine.  Patche downloads over a
modem take forever though.
