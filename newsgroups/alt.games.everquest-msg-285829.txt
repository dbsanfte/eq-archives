There've been some posts about this on Sony forums and elsewhere.
Apparently it really is just the domain that expired, so you can't
currently get to the site using the name "wtfcomics.com", but you
can still find it if you know the numeric IP address:

http://67.15.103.230/index.html

The links on that page (to forums etc.) also try to use wtfcomics.com,
so you'll have to replace that with 67.15.103.230 to follow the links.
From the forums on the WTF site itself, it looks like they're well
aware of the expired domain and are working to deal with it; I couldn't
tell if it was a money issue or what.

And on the down side, there's STILL no new comic pages since December...
