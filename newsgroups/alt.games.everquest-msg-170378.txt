That was my only major gripe with the movie.

Actually, I liked that stuff, I thought it was a nice way to show
Aragorn's feelings even though Arwen wasn't with him, and it shows
more clearly that Eowyn's feelings are getting her in trouble than the
book did. And bitter conversations between Arwen and Elrond are
referred to in the book.
