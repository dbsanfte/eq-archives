We had ~4 copies drop recently... I didn't see any of them or any funds from
them!   I don't actually recall the last time I got "sellable" loot from a
group though.. all of our guild clerics have it anyway

Whats the HP on the emp ring?  iirc it doesnt better (or noticably better)
9/10th coldain ring or even the second chardok quest ring

You mean because the shamans are now in a different group? (torp is group

back to the days of PoF/PoH raids though, where the raid leader places
everybody into the various groups (whilst making himself a nice ks group!
hehe)
