EQ contains a *lot* of underutilized areas--places that are full of mobs
that are almost never hunted.  I'd suggest that your group do some exploring
to find interesting places.

For example, consider Frontier Mountains.  Lots of people hunt at the giant
fort, or near the Ill Omen zone.  Almost no one goes to the west side of the
zone, which is loaded with roaming giants.

Same goes for Emerald Jungle, Trakanon's Teeth, and many many many other
zones.
