}The KDS is 4 giants, level 45 ish or higher.  Highly magic resistant, run SoW

}hate list, so they are not up unless someone tripped the trap.

You must have run into a different KDS than me. :)  I tripped the trap 
while invis, and they didn't attack me.  They also conned indifferent.  I 
ran to a discreet distance, dropped invis, and got scowls.  Deduce what 
you wish. :)

Note:  it only takes one vocal person's invis spontaneously dropping at 
the wrong moment to start a widespread rumor that a particular mob sees 
invis.
