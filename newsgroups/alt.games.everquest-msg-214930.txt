One of the reasons it was an easy dungeon is the 30 and 32
characters.  Adding a couple of people who can just barely
go to LDoN with the highest level (max level range at 65
is 7 - we can take 58's in, but a 57 grouped with us and we
couldn't get an adventure) will dramatcally reduce the 
difficulty of the mobs.  It will also dramatically reduce the
reward.

EG - A regular adventure with a group of 65's and one 58
yielded a dungeon with about half the mobs blue to the 58,
the rest white/yellow/red.  These mobs had around 15k hp
and hit for 370's.  Adding a 2nd 58 and suddenly all the
mobs were blue to the 58, had 10k ish hp and hit for about
260.  In the first case we got 51 points (max points for
a 65 on normal) in the 2nd we got 34.  We also only took
30 minutes to complete the 2nd.

Cash wise we were getting 150pp to 200+pp a piece on the 
split at 65.  In 6 hours we completed 4 adventures, I got
2 aa, 3 blue in 65 (I had to boost my cushion a bit).  In
my 10 adventures now I've gotten 2 +6 int augments.
