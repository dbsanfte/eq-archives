Greetings,

I play a 56 Paladin on The Rathe.  I'm 15% shy of 57.

My hours of play make it difficult to group.

I have a buddy's 57 Chanter that will come usually come along for an out-group, 2-box
killing spree.

So far I've tried the Sanctus Seru guards - too badass for me.  I heard they were the
recent beneficiaries of a level bump, and I believe it.

The Reanimated Drudges in Maiden's Eye handed me my ass, even though I was buffed to 5kHP
and 1200AC, and I averaged 40DPS 2HB.  The chanter tossed everything he had at the MOB,
and I still needed an LoH in the middle of the 1st fight, and several long root-heals for
the 2nd fight, which was lost when I went OOM with the mob at 20%.  Fortunately the same
buddy gave me the keys to his clicky cleric ;->

Can you suggest any solo spots that would provide respectable XP?

Best regards,

Tim ==
