You realize, of course, that the *effect* of these commercials is that
everyone is now talking about "the Quiznos Rats". For every one like you who
swears at them and promises ever to eat there again, there will be some
number (4 or 5? 100?) who will start eating at Quiznos just because they
remember the commercials and this discussion.

There's an old saying in the PR and advertising business: "There's no such
thing as bad publicity". Quiznos wins either way.
