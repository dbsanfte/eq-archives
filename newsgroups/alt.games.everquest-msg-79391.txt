I was thinking of playing the game, but a couple of things put me off
a little bit.

1) RvR battles when the dominant RvR class are stealthed archers capable
of doing one shot kills on a large number of characters. The mind boggles
that they would allow this to happen.

2) A party experience system which is, now, even more stingy and tight
than the EQ system. Adding to the fact that levelling is boring and the
game, in theory PvP, is immensely level based. Oh, and the death penalty
is *worse* at high levels.

3) Missing content, serious realm imbalances and more than 50% of the
classes have either minor or major balance problems.

4) The huge RvR realm battles have major lag even on quite uber systems
and at worst can crash the entire zone. Much of the battle relies on
utilising NPC realm uber-guards and engine problems (spell casting 
through walls and doors). Heck, with their engine you can't even turn
spell effects off.

5) Mythic appear to have lost the plot entirely. I read the patch notes
and I have no idea where they're going. Lots of dumb moves that have
alienated huge portions of the fan base.

6) Balancing PvP (or RvR) against PvE using the same ruleset is really
hard. Balancing three different realms is very hard. Creating a dynamic
conflict which is rewarding yet stable is probably impossible.

I'll probably still try it, but i'll give a couple of years for them
to actually finish the game and for the fans to decide if it is good.
There's certainly no point in rushing at this point, the powergamers
have reached level 50 and worked out which classes and tactics are
uber.
