We had more wierdness than I even want to think about. Just after
logging on, the guild I just joined was apparently mobilizing to go on a
patch day killing spree. When I attempted to zone from where I camped to
CS (we were heading to Zlandicar) I crashed. Patching on my way back in
seemed to fix that for me. However, Tarre doesn't use the default UI.
(Has some skins loaded) and she crashed going into and out of SG until
the default skin was in place which stopped that.

After Zland we hustled up to UP for Rumblecrush, and while pulling the
guardians we were both suddenly disconnected. Like you, however, when I
logged back in I missed the character select screen entirely and showed
up, still grouped, in the middle of the raid. A few other people had
crashed also, so I didn't feel to bad, though, and we proceeded on. RC
is killed, and we're looking at taking Doom next when a GM announces
that all mobs in all zones will be reset in five minutes.  *sigh*. 

After that was done we headed to PoI to do the Junk dragon. This one was
a real beaut! The gnome was well on his way, just about to the end of
his annoying little journey when we were both suddenly disconnected
again. This time I had to go through the whole character select screen
like a normal crash and zoned back into PoI, only to find.... 

Two thirds of the raid force had instantly been teleported to the Plane
of Desktop, and the remaining ones (sans MA and clerics) had been wiped
out totally. Everyone else rushing to get back in and help had been
poppping back into the zone in ones and twos into the middle of the
massive train that had ensued.

We saw several messages broadcast from a GM about how they were aware of
this problem or that problem, were working on it "actively" and
appologized for "any inconvenience".  That got a hearty round of laughs,
I can assure you. :-)

So, yeah. All in all, one of the wierder post patch nights in a while.
There's some doozy bugs in there. I forsee a lot more server down times
in the coming days. (Go Go Post Re-set Raids!)
