Is the chanter epic worth doing anymore?  Got my chanter to lvl 57 almost 58 
and for a change from the exp grind thought I could do some quests.  If it's 
worth doing is there a good walkthru anywhere?  Can any of it be soloed?  I'm 
not in a guild so it would be tough to get a group together although I am 
able to 3 box a 65 beastlord, and 61 cleric, and my 57 chanter.  I checked 
therunes.net but didn't see a guide for it anywhere.  If the epic isn't 
worthwhile then can anyone recommend a good Primary slot and Secondary slot 
item for a high elf enchanter.  I've got about 10k in the bank.
