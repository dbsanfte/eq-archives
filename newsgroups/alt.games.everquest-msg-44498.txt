Here's my take on things from my perspective.

I'm a UK player with a ranger as my main now.  Being UK means I play at
funny times to a large % but I have found that I now normally group with the
same dozen or so people. They like how I work, I like how they work ( esp
the chanters Psyychii,Tyne).

I Iregard my rangers role as three fold.

1/
 I do damage and quite large amounts and without proper thought I die.
1/
I watch the casters backs in a fight, during downtime or moving towards an
area.
1/
I stop a mob from running off and trying to get his mates to help him out.

You may be wondering while all those are marked as number 1. The reason
being that all are as important as the other.
Here's a few examples to illustrate things.


Room pops or adds.

Soon as I see the chanter,cleric or other intellectual getting hit. I swap
to that target and start baniging Taunt and Snaring. This immediately pulls
the bugger on too me and gives the cleric time to get out the way and the
chanter time to mez.
While you War's keep pounding on the main. I'm doing my job of keeping the
casters alive. A quick taunt with a snare thrown in and most things seem to
forget all about the person in the dress and take a distinct interest in my
paper mache armour.


Here is my taunt and Snare macro

TAUNT
/g Taunting %t onto me.
/doability 1
/pause5
/dance Aavon hurls cheese at %t.*
/say Smell my cheese you mother.*

*last 2 added for comedy value on  those long boring nights.

Snare
/cast 1
/puase 4
/g Attempting to snare %t


Moving from one place to another, say entrance to a camp spot.

I let the main tank lead ,the casters go in the middle and I follow. That
way I can see what's coming up, where the casters are and I'm right on top
if someone get's jumped from behind or unexpectedly.

What I've found is that the chanters,clerics and other casters I've grouped.
Appreciate a minute or so before a fight for me to explain exactly how I'm
going to handle them. If they have any queries better to discuss that at the
start than during a fight when you're all concentrating on different things.

Ask people how they'd like you to handle grouping,assisting, adss and the
such like. Things go wrong whether you're all doing your job or not. It's
the nature of the game, there's no definative right way of doing things.
There is however most definately a wrong way of dong it.
