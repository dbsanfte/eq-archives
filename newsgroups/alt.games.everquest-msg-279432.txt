...just realized that his monk is level 65, so this is mostly moot.

If I had written "most" then he might have a point.  10% of the time
can be "many" times as long as it is something that makes your class
worth playing.

Yes and having the ability to pacify one mob can make the monk's FD
better than the SK/Necro's, along with the fact that you can feign
while running without having to stop, turn, cast...precious fractions
of a second that do make a difference.

My point is that the monk has lots of things going for him.  It seemed
like Leif was intent on proving that monks have nothing going for them
at all.
