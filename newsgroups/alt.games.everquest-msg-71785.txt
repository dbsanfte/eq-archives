I found some of this to be true, and also found that people who group in
DAOC who never grouped in AO, AC or UO don't know how to group. They get
together as a group and play/hunt as if they're still solo. If you're lucky,
you'll get a group where people get "assigned" jobs like puller, healer,
mez, etc.

I also found there are no real "hunting" spots. You can go anywhere and find
groups of MOBs that aren't being hunted, many times because they tend to
wander a lot. And you can sometimes walk for a long time before seeing
another player who isn't whizzing past you on a horse.

Finally, the walking speed is painfully slow getting from place to place if
you don't have some sort of enhancement. Back in EQ I feel, for now, like my
barbarian warrior is constantly SoWed.
