That's simply not correct. Athlons are faster in most benchmarks, as well as
most real world applications. Any developer that intentionally pushes one
CPU types optimizations over another is making a bad move in todays market,
no matter who it is, and in any unoptimised application the Athlon will win.
I did fire up the Serious Sam "The Second Encounter" demo last night and
played through it (after 6 hours of DAoC) and noticed that it showed 3Dnow!
optimizations being used.

That used to be true, more than a year ago, but not anymore. My Athlon 1800
XP system running on WinXP has been up and running for 7 days without a
reboot. I average around 8 hours of gaming a day, and have faster framerates
in those games than someone running a 2.0gig P4 ... I'd say that was pretty
damned stable. There have been numerous problems with every chipset that
Intel has put out since the vernerable BX.

 I think many of the crashes that people put

Heh, are you running thermal probes on their systems? I'm just wondering
what would make you think that CPU overheating was more prevalent than
bad/old drivers, improperly setup systems, overclocking or other bad
hardware.

For the record I have a 1.2 gig Athlon T-bird rig running in the bedroom
thats been running since last Monday as well. I've got a friend that can't
keep his 2gig P4 up for more than 2 hours without a crash.... yet I'm almost
positive that I shouldn't automatically assume that all Intel chips are
crap... or should I?
