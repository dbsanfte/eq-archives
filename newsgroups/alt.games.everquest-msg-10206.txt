   Not so.  I know that baking is profitable for selling to the
merchants,
as long as one has a good (115+) charisma.  Make fish rolls in Freeport, 
or Smoked Shark in Thuragdin.  I don't think you can make 500 plat an
hour,
and it has to be one of the dullest ways to make coin, but it does work 
with minimal risk, and predictable certainity.
  I've heard that higher level arrows also can make a profit from
merchant
reselling, but haven't tried it to know for sure.

to do so.
