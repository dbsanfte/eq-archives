After we killed Tormax the other day and moved to Vindi (some people were
already in the arena, some hung about at the bank, some were moving etc).. a
few of us fought a pop on the bridge into the arena (where the see
invisibles start)

Of the people I saw there, 2 60 rogues (at least 1 with primal), a 60
ranger, and me (60 monk) the rogues were behind it, and I got solo exp.  Not
sure if any of those 3 were grouped, and I admit I was surprised myself to
get exp.. but it can happen.

We were actually the exp group from that point on (2 60 monks and a 60
cleric) versus a whole bunch of 60 monks, rogues and wizards.. been a while
since I got vindi exp :)
