Being a lowbie is not fun for anyone AFAIK. It is better then it used to be,
but that just means it sucks less and you can get out of it sooner.

I don't think I have ever heard someone say "Oh I wish I was level 15
again!"

They did apply the nerf bat to the hermit in SK. Used to be one of my
favorite areas to spend level ~20-26. They added two level 20 wolf pups that
hit like they are level 30. Pretty much instant death to anyone that isn't
SoW'd.

So actually they are doing the sort of the reverse of what you think is a
good idea. They are making the other places even less attractive which make
PC more attractive in comparison.
