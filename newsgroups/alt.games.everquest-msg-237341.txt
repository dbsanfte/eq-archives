I know that. That's why i mentioned it.

Omnipotent isn't strictly defined in language as being able to do
things that are not logically consistent. Its defined simply as being
all powerful. Its not unreasonable to limit omnipotences to things
which are internally consistent. Only a pedantic literalist would jump
up and down *insisting* that omnipotence means something

Nor is it my definition. So lets stop debating the gods that can't
exist and discuss the one's that can.

No. It describes a perfect being. That is the biggest bag of tricks.
It is not merely the biggest kid on the block, its the biggest
logically consistent kid on the block or anywhere else. Not only is he
the biggest, but there can be nothing greater. He is both an ultimate
and a perfect being... that's pretty much a god in my books.

If he were refined into a perfect ultimate being then he would be a
God. Besides Q needs more than attitude adjustment.

Absolutely irrelevant.

Good and evil are by intention not results. If I murder your children
in exchange for a couple gummy snacks then its an evil act. It doesn't
matter if they would have brought about massive atrocities when they
were adults, that doesn't excuse me from anything; I didn't know. I
just wanted gummy snacks.

Since the results aren't relevant, past & present are sufficient for
moral authority.

That's a load.

(i use messiah as a metaphor for someone who is going to do a 'great
amount of good' and prevent a 'great amount of evil'. Not as the
second coming of a particular religions god-incarnate...)

 A woman gets into her car and accidently kills the next messiah...
and you'd call getting into her car an evil act based on consequences
(allowing great evil to be perpetrated). A man sees the first woman,
intercepts her, then brutally rapes and murders her for kicks and you
call it a good act because, inadvertantly, he saved the messiah and
brought about much good.

If that's a standard reply to evil I think you must have mis-related
it. Because I doubt anyone would assign 'good' and 'evil' like that.
