Heh, I made quite the pile with fletching myself.  Being a newbie gnome 
enchanter, I kept getting these microservos off clockworks in steamfont, 
so I tracked down what they were for.  Then I mastered fletching.  I was 
selling the trueshots for 200pp fairly readily.  Earned enough to get 
jewelry up to a profitable level.  And now I _finally_ have enchant 
plat... yay!

Soon, I shall master tinkering. :)
