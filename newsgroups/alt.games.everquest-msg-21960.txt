Has anyone tried to get the Bracer of Scavaging lately.  I tried for about
two hours last night on Fennin Ro and killed tons of Goblins of all kinds,
Iskar, and giants while waiting for the Bandit Lord to spawn but he never
did.  This is a usually quick spawn and did not happen nor did he ever
appear on tracking.  Has he been moved or removed from the game maybe or is
the drop and spawn simply broken for the moment.  Any information would be
appreciated.
