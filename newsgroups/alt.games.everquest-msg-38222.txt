Not to change the topic, but I really just pick a market I like and stay there
till I find a better market.  In the end the PRICES of everything will average
out unless you go on an item by item purchase in which case I can't imagine
having to go to Shop Right, Pathmark AND A&P all in one day to get all of my
shopping done.  Besides, think of the extra money in Gas......

This relates to EQ too I guess, I'll keep playing there because I like it. Sure
I'll give one of the others a shot at some point after they're well
established, but if I don't like them, I'll just head back to trusty old EQ.
It's kind of like Oxygen and Food, some of us need Downtiem in the form of
video games to live. :)
