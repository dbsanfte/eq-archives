So what? The fact that hes old friends with the guildleader before this
guild was formed should be irrelevant. What should count is your
contribution to the raid. Surely you cant be serious if you disagree.

That if I contribute to a raid, then im given consideration.
Come on... I was there right from the start, I did my job properly, and I
was the only chanter on so raid wouldnt have even happened without me. Ad im
told im not alowed to bid for any loot? Thats just wrong.

I think youre confusing me with the initial poster there. Nothing was said
in GC in my case.

True enough if youre a melee. For casters I dont think thats true tho. No
items are going to significantly improve my chanters usefullness, at least
nothing like being level 60/dire charm will.

This last bit has me puzzled. Are you saying that I should be prepared to
put in 2 weeks solid effort to a non uber guild, with no loot, for the
chance I might get to be a full member? Well, I think thats bs, and im not
that desperate to join *that* guild. Other big guilds have already asked me,
when im 60 ill probably take them up. Waaaambulance? yeah, right. whatever.
