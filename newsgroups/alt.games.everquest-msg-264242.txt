Why, oh why do the vast majority who reply to posts here feel it is
imperative to attach the entire post they are responding to along with their
reply??  If you are really following these posts, you must know what the
reply is in reference to.  You just read it!

I can see if you are responding to certain points in the original and you
want to tick them off as you respond, but just to default to keeping the
entire post when responding?   I don't get.  What am I missing?

For instance in a previous post, "For me, CoH is more fun."  Not a short
post.  The first reply included the entire original post and then added as a
reply, "Thx for that, I think it is still EQ2 for me but if I get bored of
it I may well give CoH a go )"  I had to scroll down pages of what I just
read to read his one-liner.

I think I must be missing something.  It's not like the people on these news
sites are unintelligent.  Heck, just knowing about these newsgroups puts you
ahead of most imo.

So, please tell me why?...
