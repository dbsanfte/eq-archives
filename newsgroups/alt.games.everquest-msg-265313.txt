There is virtually no downtime. No one thinks about downtime, the issue 
doesn't exist in any real sense compared to what we've had to experience in 
past games.

I've not seen anyone camping for items in the main game, but I can't say 
whether this is just because it's beta and it's new and so everyone is 
running around more than usual, exploring new ground. The one place that I 
have experienced spawn camping, unfortunately, is on the Isle of Refuge. In 
the far reaches of the Isle is a little graveyard where fallen pirate 
skellies spawn. They drop treasure maps that are quest givers to generate 
the Captain Rockbelly quest. Rockbelly drops a virtual sword that can be 
turned into the mender on the Isle for a very nice actual cutlass, and as a 
result, the skellies are camped and camped pretty hard. In this one spot 
you'll find people doing exactly what they were doing in WoW, standing 
around trying to beat each other to the spawns. It was pretty disappointing 
the first time I experienced it, but as I say, it's the only place in the 
entire game that I've experienced it. I think it happens here for a couple 
of reasons. First, the Isle is small and gets crowded very easily. I logged 
in a new character last night around 2am and wound up on "Isle of Refuge: 
Qeynos 7", to give you some idea. Second, even though it's entirely optional 
it's one of the few cool dropped quest objects on the Isle and so it's the 
first exposure most players get to the concept and it's become a pretty 
popular drop. So everyone heads for the graveyard and camps skellies for a 
map.

> Now this news, four characters only.

After having played SWG with its one character per server and then of course 
EQ's FV server with the same restriction, the 4-character limit didn't 
bother me, but I am nevertheless sending multiple /feedback requests and 
posting on the beta forums asking SoE to reconsider this move. Enough of my 
friends who want to play have complained about it, and SOE is asking for 
feedback now, so I'm taking the opportunity to voice opposition.
