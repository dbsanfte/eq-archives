Thought I'd pop into SS for one last hr and try and get a Guardian Robe for
my Enchanter...thought maybe the rarity might have been changed (if
accidently) in the patch.
The pool room is a little busier than before.
If you don't have SS faction go in invis'd, there are now 3 mobs sitting in
what was a safe point to zone in, one (Fliff) is a caster. There are more
wanderers in and out...or, should I say, there are NOW wanderers. The
Guardians are all gone, nothing replacing them is particularly tough but
more of them are casters and there are a lot more in there.

Didn't go any further from the room, not sure if there are any guardians
left in SS now, I did start clearing the room but there are so many mobs in
there now the start respawning before you have got far enough away to not be
aggro'd I got bored and left.
