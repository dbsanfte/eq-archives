Disable Norton when you play, make sure nothing else unnecessary is running 
in the background.  Consider upgrading the video card, and getting even 
more memory.  What type of connection are you sharing?  Broadband I would 
hope.  What processor?  800MHz PIII?  If so, you would get limited effect 
from upgrading your video card, you'd want to go to a 1GHz processor at a 
minimum.

I currently run
PIII 1.2GHz
1GB 133MHz SRAM
GeForce4 ti 4200 with 128 MB of DDR
Win 2k pro
80GB and 40GB ATA100 HDs

I run EQ at 1280x1024 with all options turned on set to high, have lag 
issues only on raids and in the bazaar, and once in a while in other zones 
if there are a lot of people in my view.

For raids, I turn off all spell effects, 3D sky, PC names, and that seems 
to cure the problem.
