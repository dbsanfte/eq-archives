>>> I suspect most of the people saying that are teens whove never done it
but like to joke about it like its cool or something.<<<

The way it was described to me is like this ...

crack is highly addictive, gives a temporary high, and makes you crave more
after you come off the high ...

breeze/clarity gives you a temporary boost in mana regen, after it wears off
your mana bar seems almost to stop, making you crave another buff after the
original wears off ...

hence breeze/clarity = crack
