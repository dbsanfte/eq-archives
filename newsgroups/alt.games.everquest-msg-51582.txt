Thank you.  I appreciate all this other discussion too, even though I'm only
level 10 so most of that stuff doesn't matter at this point but I will
listen to all and decide when the time comes.

I just wanted to know which I should try tailoring next to replace my
patchwork armor.

Thanks to all...

Reinforced is better but requires a higher tailoring skill.  The AC per
piece is higher.

Smithing.  Trivials at 41 I believe.
