Group of 4 (20 21 21 24).  one of the 21's goes LD and we finish the
mision in 81 mins.  I go ZERO points as did the 21.  the 24 got 1
point.  Had always seen at least one point before that so I wonder if
points handed out  has anything to do with the total number of levels
still around when the adventure is completed?
