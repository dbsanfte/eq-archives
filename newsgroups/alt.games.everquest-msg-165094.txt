Weird. I was in a group with an amibdex/primal monk and a ferocity3/punishing
blade 2hb monk, and the 2hb monk was pretty consistently either doing on a
par damage with the primal monk or outdamaging him, with the same haste
and ATK buffs, depending on the mob being fought. Sometimes he was outdamaging
him quite substantially too. They were in the same guild and the same level
so its not a case of one being totally 'ghetto' and the other 'uber'.
