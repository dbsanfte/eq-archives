All of mine were with an enchanter.  pre to 60 tank, no AA, since neither
60+ nor AA was in the game.

And while chloroblast was an option, she actually tended to use Superior
heal more, as part of her strategy.   Chloroblast you would have to spam
heal.   Superior she could cast and then sit for a few med ticks.   The mana
regained often outweighed the slight decrease in efficiency.

Please watch your quoting.  I did NOT say that, yet you made it look like it
was quoted and attributed to me.
