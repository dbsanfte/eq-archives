So level of intellagence is now defined by the name you choose? Sorry,
Vacuum Cleaner does not bend nor break the rules.

 Hypothetical

A Guy named "Bill" wants to play EQ. so he names his PC "Bill". Nope, no big
ol` fantasy name , just Bill. He reaches level 20 and people laugh at him
cause the only way he travels is by gate. pretty soon people make fun of him
cause he gates all the time. Due to the fact he has grown used to the
taunts, he decides that his sir name will be Gates.

Bill Gates

Yup, no big name fantasy guy. But according to the rules that you have
established on "Name etiqoutte" this "Bill Gates" must be an idiot. Guess
Bill Gates wasn't bright enough to come up with a fantasy name either. He
must have been busy developing the biggest OS and Corporation in the IT
industry. But nooooo, not bright at all.

 Show me the rule and too which VC is in violation :-)   didn't think so.

 Do me a favor. I decided to tone down my post and thus stop bashing. If you
actually have a good point Loki, I will give respect where it is due. But
the defense you have just submitted is very laughable at best. But the true
reason you decided that you had an opinion at all in this thread was made
upon seeing my name. Nothing more, nothing less.

Do yourself a favor, block me again. I try to remain unbiased but when I see
some moron attack a player based on a name that is Not Vulgar, Not
Offensive, and Non Intimidating, I will defend the person. I don't back down
to that certain lil group of self appointed Gods in the newsgroup, nor will
I ever. All this just because he didn't pass your lil' childish "List Of
Names".

LOL  Grow up
