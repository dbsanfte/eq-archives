Bleh, no.  Don't do it for a raid either.   The main tank's job on a raid is
to keep the raid moving and attacking, not to have 30 people sitting around
with thier thumbs up thier butts every time a double pull comes in.   Put a
healer in with each of the enchanters.  The increase in danger is minimal,
and the increase in kill rate is tremendous.

I've seen stupid tanks try over taunting in places like Chardok.   They took
so long breaking every mez, we were constantly being plagued by respawns.
When I tanked it the time after that, we got down to the king in half the
time, with significantly less deaths. (This was 2 years ago, when Chardok
raids were actually hard.)
