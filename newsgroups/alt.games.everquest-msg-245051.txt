Hey, I have a 55 Pally too.  =)

Here's the weapons I used.  I essentially decided that he would be strictly
a two-handed weapon person, although I did get both 1HS and 1HB over 100
along the way.  And actually my 1HB is maxed because I manged to acquire an
Anklesmasher, which procs a snare which is very useful for Pally soloing.
=)

Anyway, for 2HS I used both a War Marshall's Bladed Staff and a Windblade.
I prefer the WMBS because it slightly out-DPS's the Windblade and is
cheaper.  People will tell you the Windblade is better because as you fight
high-level mobs, their riposte will kill you on fast weapons like the WMBS.
When I actually starting fighting those mobs I'll begin to worry.  =)  For
now the WMBS is awesome.

For 2HB I found that the Black Handled Bonebreaker to be a really neat
weapon.  It actually out-DPS's a WMBS on undead mobs, which I usually found
myself soloing.  This weapon drops off mobs in the Bertoxxulous ring and you
can usually find it in the Bazaar for 5K or so.

For Piercing, I used the Planar Lance of Torment, which is a decent fast
weapon that is dirt cheap.  It's by far the worst of my two-handed weapons
and I only use it to keep my Piercing skills up.  There's a new 2HP weapon
available from one of the nameds in Qinmi - Dire Spear of the Muramites,
52/48.  Haven't seen one for sale yet but I imagine it'd be expensive.
