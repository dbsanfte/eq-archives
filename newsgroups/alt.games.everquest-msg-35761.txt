Im pretty sure thats not the way its done anymore. I was present at the
creation of the guild im in and the leader just got everybody who wanted to
join together, in this case by ec/nek forest zone, there was about 15 - 20
people, then he must have reported or petitioned to get a GM's attention
(actually im not sure how he did get a GMs attention) anyway, we waited around
for a few hours and the GM turned up and asked that at least ten people /tell
him that they want to join this guild then he waved his arms around, passed out
some drinks and bobs your uncle.
