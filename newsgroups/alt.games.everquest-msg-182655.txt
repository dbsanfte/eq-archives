Well I solve the problem by memorizing the stones you walk around
over.  In other words I turn the view to my feet (or just a little up
to tell which way I am going) and go that way.  I bank by selecting
the bankers feet.  I shop by selecting feet.

Another trick is to put yourself against a wall facing it to use the
/bazaar window.  Otherwise I can't move the mouse well at all.

Basically if you aren't displaying PC's or detailed buildings on your
screen they don't eat up the video card.  Lag is still there, but its
way easier to move around.  Works the same in Shadowhaven, etc.

Another trick I have found useful at "random" lag areas is to reset
from 16bit to 32bit and back again.  It refreshes video memory and
does improve performance a bit (back to normal).

Its funny but I have NEVER seen the roof of the bazaar.  In fact today
I just looked up for the first time (with severe lag doing it) in the
Nexus after zone in.  There is a cool hole in the ceiling going up to
the sky way up.  EQ really has some nice views and scenery.  Too bad
you need a mega PC to view them...
