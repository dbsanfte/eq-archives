Thank you.

I think I'll buy the game and give it a try.  I assume if you don't seem to
do well with a certain class you can start again with a different one?

I don't mind if I don't get the ulimate "Epic" weapon, after all it's
supposed to be in the playing of the game that the enjoyment is to be had,
not how many notches you have on your staff/sword etc, right?  :o)
