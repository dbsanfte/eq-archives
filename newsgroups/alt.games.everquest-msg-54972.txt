I used the same tactic with Res as a cleric.

/auction Ressurection 2cp if you drag the body to me, 2kpp I come to you.

I used to say 1kpp, but someone paid that.  My group was understanding,
and I felt honor bound to come thru, but immediately doubled my rates.
If somene pays that, I'd have doubled it again.  Eventually I figured I'd
get to the point where noone will be asking me to leave my group to
come res them.

Course my dwarven cleric is a bit more gruff, he just says "no, I won't
let my group die just so you can get some exp back.  Bring it here or
forget it."
