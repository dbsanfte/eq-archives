Given the etheral nature of that promise - no guarentee about the
actual value of the tender leading to overt devaluations, etc - 
it seems a pretty weak guarentee, but
ok, if thats the definition I guess its the definition ;)

Oh, I see - I thought you were talking about going after IGE, not the 
buyers. Smash the dealers, care for the users approach. Hm. Tough love ;)

Still, it could put a big crimp in commercialised selling I guess. Flag
low level accounts with large asset transfers or higher level accounts
with repeated transfer histories. 

I wonder if it could get to the stage it was worth the overhead of 
powerlevelling up a 65 toon *per transfer* on a new account for IGE.

Probably. A Smaller, higher value market.
