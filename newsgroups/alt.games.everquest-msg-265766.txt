The intention is for all classes to be capable of soloing.  I don't
know how this is holding up in practice, though.  I've seen scouts
complaining about inability to solo after they changed heroic
opportunities (scouts can no longer trigger them as often as before),
but that could just be general whining, or a result of poisons being
broken.

Classes in EQ2 are pretty much not like they were in EQ, even if the
names are the same.  There is no reason to assume necromancers will be
better at soloing in Everquest 2 just because they were in Everquest.
