How generous of you.  You'll be nice and let the person trying for their
epic have the drops that are worthless to you, but since you were so nice to
them it's only fair that you get a chance at the drops that'll make you some
quick cash, right?  I'm sorry but I have to agree with Empty, that is
fucking lame.  And you're a greedy bastard.  The epic is hard enough to get
without having to roll with an entire guild on each item.  I'm sure you
wouldn't be so happy about your little arrangement if you were the one
trying for epic.
