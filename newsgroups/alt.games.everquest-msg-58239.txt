If only I had snare, life would be so much easier.

If I am nuking, then I just nuke, no DoTs, that just uses up mana, generally
I don't root and nuke, I just kite if I am nuking, but in some zones that is
not practical, and I want the mob to drop fast, then I will root and nuke,
or just nuke, channelling through the hits.  If I am DoTing, then I don't
nuke.  I root, DoT, DoT, move away, sit and med.  Repeat DoTs and/or Roots
as needed.
