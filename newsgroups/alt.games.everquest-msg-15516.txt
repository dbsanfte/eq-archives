Consider the whole event as a GM event that gives you good faction with
the family. Since it's a GM event, there isn't anybody you can slay with
any thing sharper than your wit.

Beware the rabid, drunken tourist who may try throwing up on your shoes
or insulting your wife. This mob is hiding from security.

Do make out your quest list of rides and shopping items- this gives the
best faction with YourFamily.

While waiting in line for your seat in a particularly busy ride to
spawn, remember it can always be worse. This line is nothing compared to
Ragefire or even Dylin Starshine, and it's not a camp you have to repeat
over and over.
