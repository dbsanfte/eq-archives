If it's any consolation, my wizard was level sixtyone for just about
four hours before I did just that. I'm at 99% through level sixty now
and cranking out AA at 100%.  Until my partner and I find a place we can
reliably hunt that is blue at 61 and above, I have no intention of
turning regular xp back on. Even in our guild, xp groups in PoS/PoV are
just too hard to come by. Soloing would be just suicide anyway.
