Actually - this debate just raged in the forums.  When I sit down to
write a program where:

1.  I know the how of it (IE, I'm already familiar with all the functions
I'll need and the algorithms are known or easy to develop).
2.  I already know the scope of it

Then I usually lay out all the stubs with comments - BEFORE - I lay down
the code (then I just code to what the comments say the function should
do)  In fact, when I used to do a lot of ECMA Script stuff (with it's 
lack of some modern debugging tools) I had a program where I'd enter:
function name, each parameter, its type and a description, each local,
its type and a description and the return, its type and a description -
and the program would generate the stub with the debug code, basic error
handling stubs and the standard commenting blocks I'd decided on.

This has a huge advantage, even if I'm the only one who's ever going to
see the code -- When I come back 3 months, 6 months or a year later, it's
simple to pick up what I was doing.

Now, a lot of my ugly code is self-documenting due to the fact that I 
have no compunction about using incredibly discriptive function/variable
names (FlexFrame_HideOnMouseOver() anyone?)  But, I shudder at the
thought of walking away from it for 6 months, coming back and trying to
decipher a bunch of it.

Unfortunately, in this case I'm not intimately familiar with the WoW api.
Furthermore, there is some confusion on my part as to just where some
things are available (the sequence of events on loading does not appear
to be consistent - some thing fail at a point where I believe they should
succeed).  Furthermore, there is an odd interaction with the data that
WoW automatically saves (like the fact that, if a UI element is user
placed (IE dragged there) vs. that which I have to take care of (such
as anything where the location is set programmatically).

As a result I spend a lot of time "throwing code against the wall" to see
what works.  Oftentimes, once it works I move on to finishing the reason
I wanted the code, rather than go back and clean it up.
