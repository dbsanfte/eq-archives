Thanks for the free kick.

I don't need any more definitions of troll, I have plenty. You don't seem to
like any of them. How about this one;

1. [From the Usenet group alt.folklore.urban] To utter a posting on Usenet
designed to attract predictable responses or flames; or, the post itself.
Derives from the phrase "trolling for newbies" which in turn comes from
mainstream "trolling", a style of fishing in which one trails bait through a
likely spot hoping for a bite.

Things seem to be looking up though......you didn't say "moron" once in this
post. Have you been reading lately?
