Personally, I would have a root spell up, and maybe a nuke instead of two of
the buffs, you can always swap in the buff you need to cast, they last a
while anyway.  Root is great for emergency crowd control.  Nukes are just
fun.  DB, for that added possibility of getting away.  Alternate heal spell
or two for when you biggest one is not needed, although, at level 30,
probably not really an issue.  Mind you, my cleric is only level 9, so I am
not speaking from the experience of playing one.
