Been to the top on numerous chars and for some what you say may be
true.  But if you are actually interested in both the folks you play
with and the subtle dynamics of grouping then in fact the lower and mid
levels are actually full of opportunities for enjoyment on both
interpersonal and strategic levels.  I met a nice guy last night who
joined with my kitty friends and I for a few hours.  Both he and our
group were happier people for having met.  PLing your uberchar08 through
the middle of someone else's fun only earns you derision.  

In the course of playing through the levels you also have the
opportunity to delve into game mechanics anew, unless you have already
learned everything you can possibly learn regarding strategy tactics and
the like... and if you have then I'd be hard pressed to understand any
reason to continue playing.  I am sure that for some folks the game is
much less complex and even the first time through there was nothing to
be learned from or experimented with, but for many others each trip up
from the start reveals interesting new ways to use group members
abilities, I know it does for me and I have started more new chars than
