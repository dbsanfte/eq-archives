I haven't been on in many days, but these are my thoughts on these kinds of 
things.  They are cute, and can add good humor, for sure.  But, I'm sure 
there is a finite number of those messages that you can get ( unless new 
ones are patched in regularly ).  If -I- were going to add these into a 
program, I'd make them not appear very often, like maybe 5% of the time you 
start EQ.  The entertainment value of it would last longer.

After you've seen them all, and they keep cycling through, they will get 
old.  Making them more "rare" would let the entertainment last longer - as 
would regularly patching in new cute messages.

When I start playing again, I will probably hex search for these messages 
and replace them with my own, if they aren't encrypted.  After they start 
repeating, of course.
