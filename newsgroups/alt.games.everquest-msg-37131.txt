Shop bought leather has about the AC of patchwork but is heavier - why
not auction for a tailor to make you some patchwork? Someone will
probably do it for free if you have a ruined pelt and a pattern
(wolf/cat/bear depending on what size armour your race can wear).
Patterns are sold in East Freeport in 'that leather and hide place', any
they don't carry are on Spoolie Gee in the North Ro Inn.
