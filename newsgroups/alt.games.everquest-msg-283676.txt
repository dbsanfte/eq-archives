I must look up this shovel - you have me intrigued!

I've mentioned this before, but if you have your Adventurer's Stone,
check out the Forgotten Halls, an instanced zone off Nedaria's
Landing.  Designed to showcase the (then) new graphics, it is tailored
so the mobs are dark blue to the person getting the mission off Elros
Danmor, who stands in the middle of the dock area, at the near end of
they jetty. It had, and still has (afaik), an xp bonus.  Fast pops, 3
rooms to hunt in, no players to worry about, loot so crap you just
ignore it and thus don't need to clear bags out, you can kill in here
for ages...  The mobs don't wander off at 20% either, which is a
blessing for non-snare characters, heh. 

The rats/bars/little elementals get very nasty after about lvl
40-45(ish) but until then they are non-social and non-aggressive.  You
can kill a rat one pace away from it's neighbour, and the neighbour
will ignore you completely.  Pack some Alacrity, Damage Shield,
Healing and Clarity Potions and you can solo almost non-stop, as my
little Ranger did.  The combat/defence skillups were brilliant, too.

Interestingly, as an experiment, I took a lvl 20 Shroud-formed
character up there, got the mission, and added a 70 druid to the
group.  We went in, I dropped him from the group and he was able to
buff and heal me.  We didn't stay long, as my character is actually
lvl 70, so the xp in there is no real use to me, but it shows it can
be done.

It's a good way to unlock the next Shroud form though!
