I use charm all the time. To use big greens to farm little greens.

Why don't I use it to fight exp giving mobs? For the very reason
you list above.

Here is how it usually goes for me:

Find animal to charm, Then run around trying to find the thing
you want to kill. You have to run around and find it because
when you have a charmed pet, the game knows this and moves
any exp giving mobs away from you so you have to waste valuable
charm time to hunt them down. Whichever one you pick from track
(if you even have any on track that is) will be the farthest one away
from you.

Invariably some useless green decides that it wants to mess with
you and your pet, so you now have to stop and waste time fighting
this thing.Eating up more valuable charm time.

When you finally reach your target you send your pet in, then as you
said above it will get exactly one hit in and charm will break. Now both
mobs will come after you. This makes sense you see be cause all mobs
are telepathic and know when charm breaks AND they always know who
the master of the previous charmed pet was.

So now you have to waste mana snaring and rooting and re-charming
to get things under control.

When all is said and done you could have quad kited more mobs or
root-rotted more efficiently.

I have gotten charisma enhancing items that boosted my charisma
from 78 to 158 or so and it didn't seem to make any difference to me
at all. To resists or length of charm. I know Verant says it does make
a difference but if I couldn't tell then it wasn't much of a difference at
all. At least not enough to give up the wisdom ac and mana and resists
from my regular gear.
