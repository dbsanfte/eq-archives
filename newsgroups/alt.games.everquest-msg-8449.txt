Quest armor is absolutely worth wearing, but doing the quest isn't. It takes
me a lot less time and effort to raise the money to buy the item from
auction, including the time to find it at auction, than it would to actually
quest the item. I can also get much more xp for the same time frame. The
only time I find it worthwhile to do the class armor quests is at higher
level when I'm trying to help out a lower level guild mate.
