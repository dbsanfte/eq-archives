Well, I guess it will have to be this afternoon as I read your message
very late last evening. I have prepared all 4 backpacks for you (only
went LD once in the process...). Kjorn is in the bazaar, but I can meet
you anywhere you'd like if you have the time to wait through several
reboots....

To answer your other question, yes I enjoyed the items very much! It was
nice to have some decent armor and weapons for even the short time they
were in use! Many thanks!
