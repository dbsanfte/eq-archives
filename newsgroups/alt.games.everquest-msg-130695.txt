I am fighting the same problems with disconnects that started a week
or so ago (about June 27) for me.  I have worked with my ISP (Verizon
Online DSL) for a week and gotten all the kinks between me and the EQ
servers (as reported by PingPlotter -- GREAT TOOL) ironed out so there
is minimal packet loss (1 or 2 packets per hour).

However, I cannot play EQ for 30 minutes without getting disconnected
in the middle of a fight.  This has now caused me 4 deaths.  I used to
play EQ for fun. It's now torture.
