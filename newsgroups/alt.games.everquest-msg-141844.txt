Cleared it for the first time just last night hehe. Took 4 days, second
full run - first was interrupted by a patch. Except for one, we killed
all bosses (including Aten) on our first encounter. Topped out at about
65 people in VT. First gimp mage now has a key, and first gimp evacer
almost done, so sould be able to cut out at least a few of the more
mindless reclearing time.

Great zone, wonderful decor, and it's great you're forced to keep moving
rather than being put in a blind corner, fed mobs for an hour, then
COHed to another corner to be fed mobs for another 2 hours. Clearing is
the hard part, but bosses are too easy comparatively. Oh, and the blind
SUCKS heh. It shouldn't still hit you even when resisted. Some of the
loot is point blank amazing, but some of it wouldn't sell to any savvy
player over L45, which is kinda wrong for the amount of effort it takes
to get there. Not saying everything should be best-in-slot, just better
than Kunark level at least hehe
