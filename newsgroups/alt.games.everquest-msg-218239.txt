unfortunately not the way you're thinking (where you just have
to press a button).  You can, however, pull general inventory
slots to the hotkey bank and pick up/drop your weapons and 
instruments there.

Example:
-------------------------
| Gen Inv 1 | Gen Inv 2 |
-------------------------
| Primary   | Secondary |
-------------------------
| Gen Inv 3 | Gen Inv 4 |
-------------------------

As your top 6 hotkeys.

To swap an instrument from inventory slot 1 you just
Click hotbox 3 (pick up primary weap), click hotbox 1
(swap for instrument), click hotbox 4 (swap into secodary).

Personally, I used to keep my secondary weapon on the
cursor if I was only using the instrument for a short
time, but I kept an empty slot for the occasions where
I wanted an instrument for a longer period and didn't 
want to take the risk of dropping my weapon.
