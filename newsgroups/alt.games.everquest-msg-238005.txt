Here is the secret truth about Everquest:

Everquest is a collection of people with issues in real life.  (This
statement should be put on the game box as a warning.)  However, Everquest
makes you believe that it is a game of fun and fantasy with "normal"
functional human beings.

Because you are dealing with "abnormal" people, bad things will happen.  In
your case, your emotions have been played with like Beethoven on the piano.
You have become a victim of love.

In your mind, you think the woman that you were dealing with is normal,
pretty, nice, and a whole bunch of good human traits.  I would disagree and
say that she is not someone you want as a friend and especially not someone
you want to be close with.  She seems like a person with a lot of problems.
You don't want those problems.  Her husband also probably has problems.

You also have to understand that Everquest is an escape from real life.
Therefore it is often used like a drug to avoid problems of real life.

Playing Everquest to escape problems in real life is a bad decision.  And
further compounding your bad decision by trying to have a relationship with
a woman with issues is even worse.  Don't do it.

I will put it bluntly for those that have trouble understand what I am
saying or don't really want to read what I wrote.

Here is the Cliffsnotes versions of EQ:

People who play Everquest have problems in real life.

A relationship on Everquest = a person with problems + a person with
problems = an uber problem = disaster.

Lonely Guy:  Consider yourself lucky that she gave you the cold shoulders.
You just avoided getting yourself into a mess.

And I am sure that you aren't the only guy or gal that have been a victim of
love.  I read and heard stories like yours.

The only thing you could have done differently was your response to the
whole affair.  You could have rejected her initial advances.  You should
have taken the hint that she was not interested in any kind of relationship
and moved on instead of doing what you did.

You really shouldn't play EQ b/c it is a waste of money, time, and energy
and you have to deal with people with problems.  And these people are not
nice, normal, human beings.  It will be a matter of time before you become a
victim of something.

You did the right thing in quitting EQ.  Now you can go back to the real
world and fix your problems and find a nice normal girl.  (Don't look for
women online.  In my experience, they have problems also like women on EQ.)

Also, don't listen to comments made by seemingly hardcore EQ players on this
newgroup regarding the thread you started.  Why?  Just remember what I said
about people who play EQ.

It seems like they take joy in putting you down and stomping you into the
ground.  (Typical behavior you will find in EQ)

You are better than that.  You already quit EQ.
