Hints for newbies:

Don't start a barbarian, erudite or human.  Being blind sucks before you
know how to deal with it.

Don't start a cleric, shaman, paladin, shadowknight, bard, enchanter.  Those
classes tend to have an early need to group.  While you'll want to get into
grouping soon enough, you're probably better served by spending your first
few days wandering around making classic newbie mistakes on your own.

DO start a froglok.  DO hail everything and talk back to the mobs.  The
experience of being a froglok newbie is far better than I remember being a
newbie ever could be.  The detail put into the starting city of frogloks is
impressive.

I'd suggest froglok wizard to give you a good newbie experience, a workable
class if you decide to stick with it, and a fairly newbie-friendly class.
