Do you really want a citation or would any lecture at a reasonable
museum, say the American Museum of Natural History, or the Field
Museum in Chicago be accepted?  I have visited both numerous times in
my life (AMNH several times a year since it's 7 blocks away), and
assert that both museums (along with other similar museums and
Discovery Channel and National Geographic magazine and other well
known publications) have discussed that it's possible that not only
where certain dinosaurs warm-blooded, but that they quite possibly may
have had very colorful skin, rather than the boring grey that we're
used to.  In addition there are rather interesting studies about the
parenting and social structure in certain dinosaur species, based on
what appear to be group nurseries and such.
