I'm not at 65 yet so you were probably taking on mobs that hit a great deal 
harder than I am used to - that means the pet will need more healing.

I have found through parsing that while in a group as a DPS class my damage   
is split:

30% Melee by me
20% DD by me
40% Melee by pet
10% Pet procs

Obviously these proportions do vary depending on the circumstances.

I agree that what you're saying can work, I just think that if you're only 
meleeing the pet to keep the control simple you're running at ~50% of your 
maximum dps.  A shaman can surpass that with the same level of effort 
because they're not *really* intended to melee and they heal better and 
buff better.

I'm not knocking my class ;)  It just takes quite a bit of attention 
moveing around a mob to get the best damage and that doesn't appear to be 
desirable here.

You're not missing anything, I just wouldn't use pick a beastlord as a 
mainbuffer/healer if I was going to start a duo.
