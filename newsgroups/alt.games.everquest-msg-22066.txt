At first blush it might seem that you're using world geometry
unfairly, which would count as an exploit.

However, what you're doing isn't taking advantage of a situation where
the orc *can't* get to you - he can get to you, it will just take him
awhile to follow the pathing.

Just because orcs can't jump doesn't mean you shouldn't.
