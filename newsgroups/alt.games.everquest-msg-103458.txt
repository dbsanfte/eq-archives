The rabidly anti-gun Josh "ban 'em all" Sugarmann even noted
such occurrences, with a "curses, foiled again" attitude:

 "You can't get around the image of people shooting at people to
 protect their stores and it working.  This is damaging to the [gun
 control] movement."
 --Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, a
 "gun control" lobbying group in Washington, D.C., in _The Washington
 Post,_ May 18, 1993 <<Sugarmann is referring to the Korean shopkeepers
 who guarded their lives and property with "assault weapons" during 
 the L.A. riots.>>

It has also happened many times during natural disasters, such
as earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.

I still chuckle over the NPR news coverage of the armed citizens
protecting their communities from looters in the Hurricane Andrew
aftermath.  Here's a post I wrote in t.p.g at the time shortly
after listening to the broadcast:

#There was so little looting that even the notoriously anti-gun
#NPR ran a story on the situation.  The reporter described, in awed tones,
#how homeowners were actually using their *own* guns to protect their
#*own* property and families and neighborhoods, and as a result the looting
#and lawlessness that occurred immediately after the hurricane had dropped
#to almost nil, despite the fact that the areas were still cut off from
#protection by area law enforcement.  The overall tone of the story was
#that this was some kind of bizarre once-in-a-lifetime miracle, and that
#the concept had never occurred to them before.
