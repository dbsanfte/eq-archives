That depends on your class, your level and where you
are. I assume you need eggs for baking?

The very best place for snake eggs (which make 1
clump of dough) is the Paineel newbie zone. Eggs are
a common drop, and I've seen snakes with as many as
5 eggs at a time. But unless you are a heretic
Erudite, expect lots of trouble from the undead
guards.

If you are higher level, looted basilisks in
Lavastorm is your best best. The looted eggs make 15
clumps of dough.

If you are a foraging class with a foraging skill of
101 (druid, ranger, bard), you can forage other
kinds of eggs: griffon in the Commonlands, alligator
in Feerott, aviak in Butcherblock, basilisk in
Lavastorm (the foraged basilik eggs only make 5
clumps of dough, I think.) Full info on how much
dough each kind of egg makes can be found at
http://www.eqtraders.com under the recipies for
baking section.
