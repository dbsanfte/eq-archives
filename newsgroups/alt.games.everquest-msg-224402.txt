::blushes:: Confession time.  When I first started the game right after
release, I was told that if someone outside your group got the killing blow
on a mob, it lowered the amount of XP you got.  Being the utter n00b I was,
I believed it.

One day I'm in North Ro with a friend, duoing, and we have a mob down to
25%, and he's got us going pretty good, too.  Tough fight, but we'll win,
just need to recoup.  Along comes this Barbarian Warrior with a two hander
who slashes twice and finishes it off for us.

I was so mad!  I sent that guy a tell asking what the hell he did that for,
and I was steamed.  To his credit he just said, "Sheesh, sorry, whatever,"
but when I found out the truth later, I felt sooooooooooo baaaaaaaaaaaad.
To this day I've wished I could find that Warrior to apologize.

Oh man, the things we do when we don't know what we're doing. :D
