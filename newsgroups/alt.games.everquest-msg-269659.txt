I saw mention elsewhere of an apparent addage that "raid = death". Now, not 
having a character over level 12 yet (just now getting a feel for what 
class I ultimately want to play), I've obviously not seen any raid content 
yet. Can someone elaborate on this a bit?

Additionally, I have often wondered about the heroic opportunity and it's 
level of import in a raid encounter.
