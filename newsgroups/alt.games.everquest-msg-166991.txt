Doesn't require any stupidity at all.  After encountering the
routine case of any useful item having a ridiculously low
vendor buy price a few score (or a few hundred) times I think
some people just quit checking vendor prices on anything that
isn't crap.

After going unrewarded enough times people are gonna quit doing
something that appears to be a complete waste of time.

These folks are doing something they find even easier, checking
bazaar prices and setting theirs lower in hopes of getting a
quick sale.  I do that, and you do that, and quite a few others
also do that, but it's easy for me to see how some players just
quit bothering after a while.
