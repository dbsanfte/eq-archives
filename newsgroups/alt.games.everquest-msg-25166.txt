In this Act, the term `hate crime' has the same meaning as in section
280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (28
U.S.C. 994 note).


Congress finds that--

(1) the incidence of violence motivated by the actual or perceived race,
color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability
of the victim poses a serious national problem;


 I guess the real question is why isn't she on the Justice Departments "Most
Wanted List" under tha Hate Crimes Act of 1998 ?

IMO

 This is not reported because of the fact that the Hate Crime Bill was
inrtoduced to protect minoroties from attacks from majorities. Which in
itself promotes descrimination and thus when one race has protection not
hereby granted to another, it will always be perceived as a "One Up" policy.

A few good examples:
Afirmative Action
EEOC
Minority Contracts
NAACP
NAFTA
NOW

 Yes, we are our own worst enemy in many cases. I myself was told I had to
deny employment to a canidate because we had not met our "Quota" on
minorities and would lose faction with the EEOC thus putting in jepordy the
ability to bid on Government Contracts in the future.

Now how is that equal ?

Yea, I know.... shut up Getsum

Just my 2 cents
