Simplest place I have found is Shadow Haven.  Right next to the body
of water is a soul binder.  Bind your soul, hop on in and auto swim in
a corner.   Walk away.  The reason I say bind first,  I did this
myself, and I am not sure how it happened but I ended up drowning,
either one of my cats hit the keyboard to stop the swimming, so (don't
know if this can happen) someone hopped up and down on my body till I
was swimming underwater... then drown..  Id bet it was them damn cats.
