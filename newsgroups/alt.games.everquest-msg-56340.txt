Yeah, and that's why it's sooo hard to accept that sometimes that song
slot is better used otherwise.  Hell, I even keep SoW potions on me
now, just because if I'm trying to kite some random blue mob, it works
just as well and allows me 1/3 more damage.
I have even broken the druids/rangers/shammies from teasing me about
asking for SoW while we're buffing.  I just say that I can either load
Selos or manasong and they seem to get real quiet.
