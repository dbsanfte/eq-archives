I do agree that as far as most of the buffs are concerned, the spells are 
just nice to have, not all that essential.  There are a few spells that 
make a huge difference to what the caster can take on, both with a group 
and solo, that there is no other method of obtaining.  The high level 
enchanter mez is one that comes to mind immediately, the new shaman 
heals, particularly the Heal over time, off hand I don't know for sure 
what others for other classes, but there are likely one or two for each 
class that really make a huge difference.  For a warrior, it doesn't 
really matter if they are using a BoC, or a DoN sword with a basically 
identical effect.

I can see both sides of the arguement personally.  In the end, the guild 
I am in has chosen to treat the runes as standard loot for the most part, 
and I have no real issues with that.
