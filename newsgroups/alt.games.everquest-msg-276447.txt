Items themselves are not lore but the bag are lore and when you hand
the sealed bag in, you are flagged and can't get another.  A trick to
get 2nd bag was to first hail for a new bag right before handing the
sealed bag in to get a second round of the quest.  But once you hand
in the first sealed bag, you get nothing from second sealed bag at
all.  No extra potion, no bonuses, nada.  So don't bother running
around the second quest or looting 2 of everything.

I don't know how the xp gain is accounted for but I do know that SCR
AA's, shawl, and EE items have NO effect on the timer.  And I was
under the impression that potion was supposed to be 30 minutes yet the
potion itself said 15 minutes.  Dunno where SoE made a mistake.

The server downtime which should have just started was rumored to fix
a few things (15m vs 30m potion perhaps?), possibly make the
collectable lore as well to discourage collecting multiples in one
sitting, and possibly to nerf the dropable Festive Doll.  

They were free but they were selling like hotcakes in bazaar at around
5kpp >_<  If that's true no idea if the Festive Doll itself will be
changed to No Drop or if they will simply change so there's different
No Drop version while the dropable version becomes a rarity.  I hope
it's the former.

Oh yeah if you got the FREE (Lore no drop) coin with +50 CHA and put
them in ranged, you can use 2x opal encrusted cops for a combined
total of +100 CHA so even if your toon have really lousy cha, you can
still benefit greatly!  I use badolier just to save the hassle of
switching around.
