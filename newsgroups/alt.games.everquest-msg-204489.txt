I am unaware of any method for viewing a particular trader's for-sale
inventory using the Bazaar window.

When I look for things to buy I bring up the Bazaar window and view
whatever is available, given my filtering choices, of which one or
more of your items might be among those listed. I have never tried
(don't know if it's possible) to see all of what any particular trader
was selling since I want stuff useable to my class and race.

On a couple of occasions, I went to a trader, bought what I sought
him/her out for then took a look at something interesting that was in
their inventory for sale though it was almost certainly much more than
I could afford or wanted to spend or couldn't use due to class or
race.
