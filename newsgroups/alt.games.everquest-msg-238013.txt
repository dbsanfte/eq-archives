170 ping doesn't sound bad.

Manufacturer drivers or nvidia ref drivers? try nvidia if your using
something else.

Try disabling sound. (just to try and eliminate a possibility)

If your using a firewall, disable it (software), or pull it out of the
circuit (hardware). I've seen firewalls do strange things to eq
traffic from time to time. (just another possibility to eliminate)

If your using antivirus disable it. (scan for viruses before disabling
and after re-enabling.)

It couldn't hurt to delete and  re-install EQ, just in case. Hell a
clean install of windows couldn't hurt either :p
