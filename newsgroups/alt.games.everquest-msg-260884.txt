Rat ring is left over from first LDoNs in BB, no matter what it 
seemed like i was the only person always getting nailed with the 
damned poison/disease traps...in like half the stupid rooms...so 
I camped the guy until I got it, and it helped. I cant explain 
the other one, blame husband for that one, he borrowed my cleric 
for something and when I logged in there it was...and I really 
havent gotten around to replacing them yet. I probably should 
look up some good planes recipes for JC rings and replace them=) 
or maybe figure out something to camp for replacements. Maybe I 
will do the ring quest in Thurg to 8 or so.
