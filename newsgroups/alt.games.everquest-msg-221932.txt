Well, I'm just curious, what's the official/unofficial "etiquette"
regarding people PL'ing their characters?  For example, they're in
Kurns Tower and will have their lowbie character pull like a dozen
skellies on the main floor while they're buffed to the gills and
getting healed by their high level character, while other non-PL'ed
players are also fighting in there and trying to find mobs on the
first floor?  (and maybe those other players aren't high enough level
to fight on the upper floors or the basement).  Is it unreasonable to
ask the PLiing team if they could not pull so many mobs at once and
leave some for the other people fighting there?  And what if the PLing
team goes and tells you to sod off?  Would a player have any recourse?
