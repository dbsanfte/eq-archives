}Thanks!

No worries, it's one of those words it seems like 60% of the people 
misspell... I wouldn't be suprised to see it listed as an alternate 
spelling in Webster's in a decade or so.  But then we're going to have to 
start giving the definations of words, and that's just going to get 
etymologically heinous. :)

Thanks for taking the correction in the proper spirit!
