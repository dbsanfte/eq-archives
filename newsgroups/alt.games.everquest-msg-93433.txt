    We have someone that posts to our message board that doesn't use
punctuation. Let me translate:

There is a faction, Seru, that can only be raised through quests. This
faction is required for the quest to get into the Arx, where Seru (Lord
Inquisitor Seru) and his personal guard are. Everyone starts KOS to the Seru
faction. There are also a few random NPCs outside the Arx and in the city
which are on Seru faction.
