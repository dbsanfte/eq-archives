The motives make a difference NOT...

As you have said, "suicide bombings are wrong anyway you look at it".
So what motivates the suicide bombings is not relevant to determining
the right or wrong of the action.

Regardless of anything in the past, Israel does not send children into
groups of Palestinian civilians and blows everyone up.  Israel does
not send armed madmen into civilian homes and murder innocent women
and children.

Because of this, Israel holds the moral high ground.  It's a simple
concept.

EXACTLY..

In the here and now, Israel holds the moral high ground...  That is a
fact and there is no disputing it..
