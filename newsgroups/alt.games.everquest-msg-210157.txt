I just started a new ranger and am trying to lvl him up. I want him to rock!
Considering when i have dual wield what 2 swords should i get and what bow?
I have money but not loads. So keep items around 1-7k each. So far i have a
Lamentation and Defiance. As for the bow I have yet to pick and other armor
is unkown.
