I suited my 65 RNG with a Long Sword of Yesheka and added a LDON aug Heated
blade which procs and extra 50hps damage, my off hand is a Ornate Stone
Short Sword which doesn't proc anything but does some nice damage,
occationally I'll swap it out with a Bloodsworn Long Sword that does proc
some extra damage & stun.

Those combines rarelly miss the target, do great damage and work very well
at an affordable price.
