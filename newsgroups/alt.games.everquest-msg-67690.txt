I have the same card.  I like it quite a bit.  The only funkiness that I
have with Luclin now, is that not all PC's hair is the right color.  People
are telling me this is fixed, but this is not fixed for me.  I havent had a
chance yet to go to the official forums & seek resolution there, but will be
doing that later today.

For example, my character's hair is supposed to be blond, but it is brown
when I look at myself.  A guildmate's hair is supposed to be red, but is
brown.  My mage's Crystalline Robes are green & not blue (& this is very
gross, actually, helping me NOT to play him).  People that are supposed to
be blond are sometimes red (which is worse than my robes, especially on high
elves).

I have the most up-to-date graphics drivers, as well as my VIA 4-in-1's.  I
can't think of anything else I can do on my side.  Any suggestions are
welcome.
