Neverwinternights - besides Morrowind the only single player game
I played the last years for more than an hour.
Get the Platinum or gold edition,forgot how its called,it is a bundle
of the origianl NWN and 2 expansions.
Have fun with "Deekin" in Shadows of Undernzit,greatest npc party
member ever.
Play it on hardcore DnD rules,or it will be too easy.
Try to play the original campaign without "henchman" or it will be
too easy.  :)

Negative points:
You need some rogue skills to open chests,other methods
take too long,get 4 levels of rogue,then add another class,preferably
one which can make use of Dexterity(Ranger or Warrior).
Too bad it has "zones",it is even worse than in EQ,once a chapter is
finished you can not come back,totally opposite to MW.  :(

Played it on an AMD 1333Mhz,512 Mb Ram,GF Ti 4200 Grahic card,
1280*1024 resolution,worked like a dream with building shadows turned
off.
