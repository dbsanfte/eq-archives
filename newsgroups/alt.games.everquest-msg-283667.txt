That's an idea I agree with totally, and I even went so far as to
suggest to Sony, a year or two back, that accessing PoK stones (other
than the one to/from your home zone) by doing a quest or a set of
Tribute missions might be better than simply opening the whole world up
to any puny lvl 1 character with the right expansion. Something like
getting the keys to Howling Stones or Sebilis - not TOO hard in most
cases, maybe, but hard enough to make effortless travel an achievement
you worked for, dammit...  :D

As you say, no-one really has an idea in their heads of which zone is
on which continent these days, myself included.  I have to look it up
in the ingame Atlas!  It somehow spoils my sense of "belief" in the
world of EQ.
