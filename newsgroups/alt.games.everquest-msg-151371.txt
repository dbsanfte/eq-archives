Well, Just a minor update here... Last night, I *just* log on, and get a
tell from this ... creature.

Griefer tells you "WTF is your problem?"
You tell Griefer "MY problem??  You're the one who can't leave the hell
alone."
Griefer tells you "no"
You tell Griefer "I have done nothing to you."
Griefer tells you "I havnet done anyting to you." (NOTE: his exact
spellings)
You tell Griefer "Oh?  And I suppose sending me tells, out of the blue
saying "YOU WILL PAY" is nothing?"
Griefer tells you "and indeed you will pay"
You tell Griefer "Oh?  For what?"
Griefer tells you "Oh mriknoweverythingabouteqandilltellyouwhattodo24/7"
You tell Griefer "I have never told you what to do." (NOTE: and, indeed I
never have... simply offered advice)
Griefer tells you "ROFL BS"

Here's where I did a /report <his name>, and then a /petition.

I spoke about this with my guild and my guild-leader said that much of this
is probably his fault too...  Turns out, when I was offering advice (on
working on getting resist gear), this griefer told my guild leader "I'm not
listening to Kodaan... Who does he think he is??"  To which, the guild
leader said "He's effectively the second in charge of the guild and is twice
as good a druid as you'll ever be"... (My guild leader is not exactly known
for sugar-coating things - something everyone else in our guild respects,
because we always know where we stand.. :) )

Anyway, about an hour later, I got a reply from a guide... She asked me what
all was going on, so I politely told her the whole situation, and she said
she would give it over for a GM to review...  She also advised me to /report
any communications from said griefer, so that we can build up a case, and
immediately /petition it, to let the guide know that a /report had been
filed...
