Already done.  :)

In all honesty, it was nothing more than a curiosity to me.
I can't prove that, of course.  That's why I was farming
a.g.e for potential reasons why they implemented it the way
they did.  The group consensus seems to be because it was
easier to implement that way.

And if someone accuses me of complaining when I'm not,
I'll be happy to give them a "usenet black eye" for it.
Kaev fucked up, so I was happy to whack him a good one.
