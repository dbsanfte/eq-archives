Sounds to me as if the first 3/4 are enjoyable for you. If you're into
xp grinding and you have fun 3/4 of the time, youre doing pretty well.
:) It sounds like you had a crappy night. It happens, go work on a
quest or a trade skill for a bit. Those will make the xp grind sem
more enjoyable. :P

You're half right. It would make the game less tedious. It would also
mean many more high level players, and that would hurt the game.

If you can't handle a pull that small you have no business being in
the sarnak fort. Even if you have no enchanter to mez the extras, you
should have a caster who can root them away from the rest of the
party.

I won't pooh-pooh the 2 blubs. I just think of the time when that was
30 mins of hunting and sing "Those were the days".

Wow, you have a delete key, I'm impressed. :P This isn't a flame, but
if you think it's ugly now, just wait five more levels. :) 20 levels
from now you'll be wishing it was half this easy.

Finally, I have no idea what level you are, but if you're in the
sarnak fort I'd guess mid-high 20s.  The LIO xp bonus is long gone.
You can get better and safer xp in CT, just for one example. Mistmoore
is another place where xp per mob is better. In addition, it's much
easier to run for the zone when the shit hits the fan than it is in
LIO. On my server pickup groups are readily obtainable in both of
those zones. Unrest is another possibility if you're in low 20s.  I
personally think that zone is a dungheap, but it's nowhere near as bad
as the Lake of Idiots.
