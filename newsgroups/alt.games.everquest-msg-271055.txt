Yes, it does.  You obviously haven't learned the wonders of Bind Wound
because of your reliance on buffs at an early level.

I'd rather have grouped my cleric with a knowledgable warrior with BW maxed
(I'm guessing your chatacter's Bind Wound sits at 0).  It showed me he
understood the intricacies of his class and how his class interacted with
other classes, because by using BW he helped me manage my mana pool.

I've always been neutral on the subject of buff whoring (well, unless you
count how vocal I was in my dislike for unlimited KEI), but this example
changed my mind regarding it.
