 The best thing against casters is level. Try to fight mobs that are low
blue if they are casters and you should have an easier time resisting,
or reducing damage from, their spells. If you are fighting even con or
higher casters expect to take full damage most of the time, especially
if you have low magic resistance.

 Also try increasing your magic resistance. Try to find a few low cost
items with +MR. You don't need to wear it all the time unless you're
primarily fighting casters but it's good to have so you can switch to it
when needed.
