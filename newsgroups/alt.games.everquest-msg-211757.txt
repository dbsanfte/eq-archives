	Now you're just being pedantic.  Even priests I've talked to call it
Revelations, since there's really more than one revelation in it.

	Nope.  The idea of Satan as an enemy of god does not appear anywhere in
the bible.  He is an enemy of man, in a sense, since he is tasked with testing
the faithful, but not of god.

	You're free to cite chapter and verse to the contrary.  (I, of course,
can't quote passages that aren't there. :-)  I happen to have a bible right
here so I can look up anything you'd like to quote.  It's the NRSV; I tried to
get the One True Version but the bookstore was all out.
