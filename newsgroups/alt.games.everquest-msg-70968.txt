I have to disagree on this point.

In a game like Quake you have a well-defined set of textures that are
needed to render the entire "zone".  There are a limited number of
weapons and the character appearance is mostly stagnant.

In EQ, there are thousands of weapons, armor and equipment that can
become visible while inside any single zone.  The textures for every
item in everyone's inventory and all loot on mobs have to be loaded
into RAM.  They cannot all reside on the 64MB of memory in your video
card so there must be a routine that decides which textures to
transfer from RAM to your card when rendering each frame.  That is a
lot of processing overhead for your CPU to handle before your video
card can even begin to draw.

Games like Quake are optimized to keep all of the needed textures on
the card's memory for the duration of the game.  For EQ there is no
such optimization because of the breadth of possible textures.

For a concrete example, I recently upgraded my 1.2ghz Athlon with 1GB
of PC100 memory to an Athlon 1800+ and 1GB of DDR memory.  I kept the
same video card (ATI Radeon) and the performance increased by at least
50% in scenes with a lot of characters.

Now there are certainly other possibilities, but a texture search and
transfer bottleneck seems to be the most likely culprit.
