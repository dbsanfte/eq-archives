Last night I was at the tunnel in the commons
doing some trading when this lvl 53 Ogre Warrior
started shouting and asking if anyone had any
items that he could "borrow" for a while.  He said
that someone hacked his account and stole most of
his stuff.  He came up to me (37 Ogre Warrior) and
asked me if he could borrow my Mithril BP that I
had just bought yesterday for a very low price of
300pp.  I talked to him a while and he said that
he would make it worth my while by getting me a
cobalt BP or a high end weapon in a few days to a
week.  I rolled the dice and handed it over.  For
a 300pp investment I figured I might see a nice
return if the guy is honest.  I know you don't get
to be lvl 53 without playing every night so I'm
sure I will be able to get in touch with him.
Worst case scenario, he quits the game and I never
hear from him again.  What would you have done?
