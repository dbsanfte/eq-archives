Spiders in EK seem to drop a lot of silk (a friend's guildmate has been
farming them for about a week now)
From what I hear (never been there)  the heart spiders in Upper Guk drop a
lot of silk also

My problem has been getting not silk swatches but silk THREAD, no newbies
seem to realize how much it is needed, and the twink/alts are probably
keeping it and vendors rarely have more than one or two, probably gets
dumped on the vendor with like 500 things in inventory already...
