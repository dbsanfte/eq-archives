Just kill more gnolls: Lots and lots of gnolls. Once you get your faction up
high enough with guards/Tillin, then get a level 5 druid or 14 ranger to
cast camouflage<or invis from a mage type> on you to get by the wandering
Paladins, Circle of Three mages, Bards, and Temple members.

You should know that turning in teeth to Tillin gets you in serious trouble
with the Corrupt Qeynos guard and I think the Circle of Unseen Hands. This
can be balanced a bit by turning in moonstones to McNeal Jacob since you
gain Temple/Pali<?> and Karanas Residents factions from doing that. I kept
my ogre camped in the bar next to McNeal doing nothing but turning in
moonstones for a few days. Getting by all the bar patrons and other factions
in S Qeynos was too much trouble.
