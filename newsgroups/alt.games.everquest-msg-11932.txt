From what I have seen there is no difference in the combat in AC to EQ, it
requires no "manual" skill to perform (if you want to be busy in combat ,
play a Bard)
The trouble with giving manual control over combat actions is that anyone
suffering from latency (lag) is going to be at a disadvantage to the mobs,
that are suffering none and will never miss. I don't see any as better than
the other, they just tkae different approaches to the world. EQ is
definitely the least imaginitive of all of them, it is basically D&D online
(which itself is just ripped from Tolkiens novels) where the others (or at
least AC) have tried do a fantasy setting but without such obvious
plagiarism.

Necro's and Druids have little trouble solo'ing. My friend is confident she
can make 60 (or damn close, currently 51) without ever grouping again (won't
get any loot tho) My warrior has spent more levels solo'ing than grouped, I
solo'd 31 - 35 (at 35 went to OT) This is slow and your choices are minimal
for hunting.
The game wasn't designed for solo play, the world could not support 2500
players all hunting solo.

As for Guk, I have NEVER hunted there, I am a Dark Elf. Made my 10th to 27th
levels bound in Qeynos and hunting the areas around there, then bound in HH
then Neriak then OT in Kunark and now in Thurgadin.
