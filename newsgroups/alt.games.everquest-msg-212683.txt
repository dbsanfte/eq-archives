Here's what I read, on Allakhazam's:

"In the faun building that leads to the Plane of Growth is Shamus Aghllsews.

'hail Shamus Aghllsews'

Shamus Aghllsews says 'Welcome to my fiefdom wayward Gnome. I am Duke Shamus
Aghllsews of the Tunarean Court. Only those who pledge friendship or
membership to the Court are allowed sanctuary in the Wakening Lands.

'I pledge friendship'

Shamus Aghllsews says 'You must first prove your intentions to the Tunarean
Court. I will permit you to participate in an oath of friendship only after
you bring me four picks used by the Kromrif Laborers that are attempting to
build into our lands.'

Give him the 4 picks. You gain experience and +TunareanCourt."

So... you can gain pack Tunarean Court faction by doing this quest over and
over again.  Of course, the mob's on TunareanCourt faction, so if you're KoS
you'll have to do one of the KoS turn-in tricks.

This doesn't do a thing for Protectors of Growth, of course, so you'll still
be KoS in PoG.
