Prescription list is still full, never met anyone who won't sow or doesnt
say that they cannot, if they cannot i dont push them or complain. Not yet
met anyone who ignores me when i clarity. I usually fly by clarity every
medding caster i see. Only two people on my refuse list, a druid who sent me
abusive tells saying WTF do i think i am not giving him a clarity after i
asked him for a chloroplast. I had never spoken to him, was partnered with a
lvl 48 druid and it was the first i knew of his existence, i explained it to
him that he must be mistaken and he was still WTF etc. so he went on ignore.
Another is a cleric who I had met many times before and he had advanced to
the point of gaining his epic, I had died and he was sitting there doing
nothing waiting for a guildy to come to TP him, i asked nicely will full
emotes if he would please cast a rez (no mana for the epic and no effort as
the corpse was at his feet) he ignored me and continued to talk in /say to
his two friends with him so he is on the ignore list, and his guild for that
matter. Oh and another guild is on blacklist for the actions of one of their
KS druids.

Never really an issue as i always carry 2 10 shot potions anyway
