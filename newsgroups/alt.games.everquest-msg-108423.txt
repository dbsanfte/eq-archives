If I'm FM and have clarity/bard power and relatively low pulls,
I will toss celestial healing on the necro (or other suckers) quite
often, theorizing that the mana they will get off the heal (one of the most
efficient ones I've got) will do more damage than me spending it on
a nuke.  Particularly with specialize alteration, my points per mana
spent are -much- better in heals than in nukes.  This is what I mean
by "reverse mana pump.."  necros are often though of as primarily
mana pumps, feeding the cleric (or more rarely other casters) mana,
but there are plenty of circumstances where it makes more sense
to feed -my- mana to the necro, so I'm not wasting med time sitting
there FM.
