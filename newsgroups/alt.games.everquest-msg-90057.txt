Yes I am a horrible warrior. I let this go way to long...

I am a level 33 wood elf warrior and trying to decide what new weapons I
should get. I currently am wielding a Silvery War Axe + a Brazen Brass Kilij
(1h slashing) and (2hs) a Langseax Of The Wolves. Any type of weapon would
be fine, Luclin Velious and Kunark are all accessible to me. I am in a guild
but raids might be a bit to much at the moment (guild issues. Yuck its
nasty).

I know I sound like a little kid or something but a weapon with a proc would
be really awesome. Heh...Thanks for any advice you can give me.
