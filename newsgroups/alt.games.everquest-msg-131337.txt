ALmost but not quite.  There is a second exp meter available to you
at any level post 50.  You can shunt your normal exp into this meter
in 10% increments, however you choose.  While many level 60's
do turn their AA to 100%, this isn't automatically the case.  Just as
many have it set to 90%... with reason.  Whenever you die, all lost
exp comes out of your leveling exp pool, none from your AA pool.
If you set AA to 100% and tend to die with some frequency, you
will inevitably slide back to being level 59.

Likewise, there's nothing to prevent a level 51 from turning AA to
100%.  I went to 100% AA shortly after the release of Luclin, untill
I got my first point which I put into Run.  To me this was the one ability
that was better than leveling, after reaching Run 1 I put AA to 0%
and went back to working my way up the level ladder.  I experimented
with putting a little exp into AA but it just doesn't seem worth while.

All skill points are the same difficulty.  Each AA point takes the same
exp points as leveling from 50 to 51.  Of course those exp points are
much easier for a level 60 character to earn than for a level 51 character...
Without doing the math or anything, I'd think a level 51 character
with AA set to 50% from start to finish of level would see one or two AA
before Ding 52, while a level 59 set at 50% might see a dozen or so AA
before hitting 60.

Each AA has a limit as to how many levels of it you can buy.  Add all those
limits together for your class and you do get a "maxed out AA" level, haven't
looked too closely into that but I think I've heard the limit is 75 points?  Thats
the equivalent of going from 50 to 51 75 times...meaning that a maxed out
EQ character now has "leveled" 135 dings!

To do this the hard way would mean going to 100%AA at 51 and keeping
at it till maxed out on all the General AA, then leveling up to 56 so you
can max out all your Archetype AA, then up again (to 59 or 60?  not clear
which since I simply don't care) to where you can max out all your
Class AA
