Is it normal for someone to try out a new weapon skill here?  
A guy in my group last night (level 30) decided he was going to work on his 2
hand bash skill right after entering the zone.  He had only trained one point
in it.  Our only other tank was a ranger.  The 2 hander guy wasn't getting many
*hits* and SHOULD have been the main tank.  
I was the cleric - spent all my time healing the ranger because the *tank*
couldn't get aggro because he wasn't HITTING.  I never had more than 30 mana,
(was also casting lull).
I think this was rude.  We had a mission to complete and I think he should have
waited until we had completed the mission to start "learning" a new weapon
skill.  
As an aside, is there a way to avoid all those poison traps????
