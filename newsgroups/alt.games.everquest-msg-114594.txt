While in the game, type /hotbutton LANG. A window will come up with an area
for you to be able to enter 5 or 6 lines of text in it. You can put in there
anything that you want. When your happy with what you entered, put the new
hotbutton on your toolbar. Now hit F10 until you get to the windowed mode
where ALL the graphics show up. Right click on the chat area and it will
change to a window that allows you select your default chat channel. Select
group here. If you are on a regular server Common Tounge will be the default
language. Left click where it say's Common Tounge and it will scroll through
the different languages that your character has.

Get into a group with people that want to share languages and spam the group
with your new hotbutton. As you spam them, they will get a message everynow
and then that their Language Skill has improved. For any improvements to
show in the Character Window, they will have to zone for it to log it'sself.
