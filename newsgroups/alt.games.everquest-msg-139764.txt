From what I've seen pickup raids on Vox have a 75% (or higher) failure rate.
If its a pickup raid your kinna doomed from the start... There's always some
kid on his first raid that ends up screwing things up in one way or
another... I guess thats how you learn, but its very painful to watch... Try
to tag along on an experienced guild's raid.... Save yourself hours of
annoyance....

With that said.... I believe the secret to Vox is enchanters.  If your Vox
raid doesnt have 3+ enchanters to mana seive then get the heck out of the
raid... their chances aren't great....
