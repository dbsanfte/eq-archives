Not that I ever found, after 35 I was forced to group, saying this I was
able to solo Sarnak Beserkers at 38th but this was never a guarantee'd
victory, some were tougher than others (there is a level range and all con'd
blue) and it would also depend on how my Yaks proc'd. Sorry to say but as a
non twink your solo'ing days are coming to an end.
