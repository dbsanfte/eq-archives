Yep, if you're a non-porter, and you're anywhere close
to a Luclin teleporter, getting to another continent
is now much easier.

However, you're in for a (max) 15 minute wait to go
up, and 15 minutes back down.

Nice thing about going to Luclin is that you know 
how long you have to wait for the port, and you can
go afk once you get your little stone from the portal
scion.
