I bought the box too, but, I did make sure to click on the GoD in the 
advanced section of the patcher, so I've been downloading GoD files since 
it was announced.  I didn't even install from the CD, just grabbed the key 
off the box to register the expansion.  There was a largish download even 
so, took 5ish minutes with broadband.
