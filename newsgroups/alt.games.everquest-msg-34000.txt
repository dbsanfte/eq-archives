I had a program that figured out damage of weapons I have (or hope
to get) but had to reformatt and lost it.  Thought I had it on a
disk but didn't.  Now I can't remember where I got it to save my
life.  Anyone out there know of such a program and where it can be
downloaded?  I looked around for it but have been unable to find it
so far.  Thank you for your time.
