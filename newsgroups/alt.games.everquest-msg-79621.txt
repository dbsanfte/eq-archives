I think earlier than 25 is OK if you're careful about how you time it.

The red bandit will cross from left to right in front of Dyllin's spawn spot and
then stand near the wall on the right for a minute or so. That's when you want
to hit him with Harmony. He'll wander away toward the entrance tunnel and will
be gone for a few minutes, giving you plenty of time to do away with Dyllin.

I hit the bandit with Harmony every time he walked by just to have something do
do during the 5.5 hours I had to wait. I also kept See Invisible up the whole
time.
