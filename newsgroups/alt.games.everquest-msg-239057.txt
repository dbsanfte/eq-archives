I was in the beta for that. Doing the 7-day trial now to see what the
state of the game is. Content was a bit lacking at the end of the
beta. :( Seems it has picked up, but still needs work. They have a lot
of potential, though. Hope they manage to pick everything up to where
it could be, it'd be a shame to see such a great crafting system go to
waste. :(
