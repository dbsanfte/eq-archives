georg, I dont know you and mean no offense.... but electricity and
water do not mix.... any notion to use a common everyday laptop for
this in a bathtub is extreamly stupid... (almost as stupid as all my
spelling and grammer errors)   Now im sure there are industrial grade
laptops that are totaly insulated that could be used.... but I just
had to state the obvious about the idea of using a laptop in the tub
and just needing a towl to dry your hads ever now an then.
