Hmmm...you certainly read a lot into my post, but apparently you didn't
get quite far enough into it or misunderstood.  See at the end of that
sentence you quoted, that I wrote.  There are two little (I apologize
for getting technical here) thingeys at the end of it.  One is a
semi-colon and the other is a right parenthesis.  Now while looking at
those two symbols, I want you to rotate your head 90 degrees so that it
looks like the semi-colon (the dot with a comma below it) is above the
right parenthesis.  What does it look like now?  That's right!  It looks
like a little smiling face that's winking at you!  Now a lot of people
use those or some variation there of, to show that they're kidding,
because we can't see there face here on Usenet.  No, Cursim, that's just
your reflection in the monitor!  You're not seeing me.  So if you'll
keep that in mind next time before you blow up at a playful little
comment, you'll make the Usenet a little less hate filled than it
already is.  HTH,


Wayland's Ghost
 ...be careful, with that temper you're asking the trolls to eat you
alive.
