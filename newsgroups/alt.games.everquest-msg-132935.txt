Tenebrous mountains, off the blue alien soldiers.  I can't remember their name
right now, but they're not grol bakus.  Might be meena hunes, or might be the
other blue ones (the one you want is air, the other is water).  They also drop
in the grimling caves, but the aliens are faster if you have tracking
available.
