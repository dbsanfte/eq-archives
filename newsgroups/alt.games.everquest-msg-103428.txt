Agreed but, my ignore list is full and the people on it are there for a
reason, I look at the list every so often but I am now at the stage that I
KNOW exactly why each person is there in it's not for some slight annoyance,
like a two way conversation not held in zone wide channel.

These 'tards rarely use /ooc exclusively, preferring to cross to /shout so
as to get more people with the conversation. I can only assume that they are
trying to show off that they have an online friend or that they are hoping
for others to join the chat as they are lonely, otherwise tells would be far
easier, of course they probably don't use tells because the default colour
isn't easy to see and changing the colour would be beyond them.

For the record, I am with TH, Dan and Kaev on this, that channel is not
meant for this kind of crap, it was never meant as a zone wide IRC to
discuss whether or not you "Luv this ch00n" or whether you or your guild are
"uber" but I would much rather they kept it to OOC as I am more used to
seeing it in Shout. The OOC channel is far easier to filter than shout, of
course this brings up the obvious arguement of "why do I have to filter
people or channels because of a couple idiots" Well thats life online :ï¿½/

I have been toying with the idea that I should just set up a chat channel
and ask friends to join it with just that Guild and Say on I can let the
rest of EQ go to hell
