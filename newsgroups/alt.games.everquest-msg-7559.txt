For the longest time, I have thought about making a Shaman, but the only
race I really liked for them was the Barbarian. I never really tried it
because I never really liked the thought of being night blind. Well the
other night, my best friend said he wanted to start a warrior and wanted me
to start something that would compliment him in a group situation. I
originally thought to myself "Cleric" but, then talked to my Guild Leader
who is a Barb Shaman. Well, needless to say, he talked me into it.

I entered into Everfrost with all my newbie gear on, and proceeded to beat
stuffing out of some Decaying Skellies. I was doing just fine until a one of
those Vengeful Composer's decided he didn't like me whooping up on his
cousins. "Loading, Please Wait"

Ok, lesson learned, watch out for those guys.

I easily leveled to 5 that night, had to be the easiest leveling character I
have had thus far. Everfrost offers one of the best newbie areas just for
the good low level quests. With the wooly spider quest, and the white bear
pelt quest, I easilly recieved over a level in exp. getting to level 6.

I am hoping to level twice tonight, cant wait for Spirit of the Wolf.
