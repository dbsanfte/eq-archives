No it might make his gameplay better, but he doesnt need to yet...DX9
requirements coming up make it a very convenient point to do
so...especially witha Banshee sitting there.

Sorry I played in Luclin with a machine below those specs perfectly
adequately. New machine makes many things better but I was happily
playing
on a Celery 300A, SB live, Voodoo3 16Meg and 128RAM in the luclin
period.
THe main issue was zone time and clip plane there.

Prior to my new machine and entering PoP Id added another 256RAM, gone
to an Audigy and a Geforce2. That eliminated the clip plane limits and
the
zoning.

OK Im now on n AMD 2700 based system and sure I notice improvments but
mainly really on raids and its also more what I can keep on rather
than
CTDs or lockup.

You may be able to play but for a good game experience make sure you
have at least 512 ram.
