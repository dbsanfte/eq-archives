This last bit is screwed up.  When an item drops, most raids don't know
in advance who will be getting the item.  There should either be an option
on the list to make all raid members capable of looting (just as all group
members are capable of looting in normal groups) or you should
be able to assign loot permission after death.  Both, really, can't think
of any reason why not other than possible implementation problems.

Ideal situation would be raid leader only loot, permission to loot assigned
after mob death.  This would absolutely lock out ninja looters.  As
currently implemented, any good no drop item that drops and doesn't
go to one of the designated few is just as vulnerable to stealth looting
as it ever was.

This is a welcome change, preventing ninja by raid members (unless they
raidremove) and making distribution of non-nodrop loot simpler since
there will now be no need to post links to the raid.  Makes it all the more
annoying though that there is no option to open looting to all raid members.

But if a ninjalooter not in the raid loots something.... poof, its gone and
we still don't know who took it any more than we did before.
