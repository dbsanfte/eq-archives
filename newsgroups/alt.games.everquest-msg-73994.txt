I've got the world's crappiest 3D video "card" (Intel 810 video chipset
on the motherboard), and a Celeron 500 processor (which is a hell
of a lot less horsepower than a Pentium 3), and I'm running Luclin
just fine.  So be careful not to overstate the system requirements.

On the other hand, 512MB really is a must, my system was a sickly dog
running Luclin until I maxed out the memory.  I have another computer
with only 384MB (max for that doddering old motherboard), and it's
noticeably more laggy than the 512MB system, although it's workable.
So consider 384MB a bare minimum, and 512MB highly recommended.

128MB, on the other hand, is a ticket to spending your time
watching the disk activity light thrash, even with all Luclin options
cranked down to their lowest possible settings.
