Yes, there is that, ok, in that case you are ripping people off for the
money... but that can be roleplaying.

About the "my druid isn't in EC but Gfay instead" part, though... see
above where I say "and the people who need em can port to WC.

Port to WC (pocket the 50+pp you make on the deal) run to
EC (On SOW no less) buy backpack of wings (for a PP or so)
and gate back to wherever you were (pocket the 50+pp you
make on the deal)

Time cost, five minutes tops, to med to full.  Profit 99pp, versus
spending 5 pp for one lone stack of the things... and I've seen
people auction WTB em for more than that 10 minutes, sitting
at the bank.  Even if you skip the taxi service and just go, you
still save 32 pp (4 times 8) on the deal, and now your med time
is even lower, plus no dealing with those pesky passengers.

If there's one class in the world that shouldn't be complaining about
travel times, its the druid.

Oh, buying this sort of thing is another thing entirely, food is a luxury
item and a sellers market.  By the way, glad to see bakers just got
a craft lift, congratulations.
