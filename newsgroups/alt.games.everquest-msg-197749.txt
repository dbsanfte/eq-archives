You know, a while back, I would have said you were shit out of luck.
However, in these changing times, a GM *might* give you a CS rez for
an LD death.  Wasn't there a thread here a while back about some
dumbass running over the edge of the pass into Kael, dropping for 20k
damage, and getting a CS rez for that?  Anyway, stranger things have
happened, so it probably doesn't hurt to try /shrug.
