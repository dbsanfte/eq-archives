I seem to recall that you use zonealarm, DT?  So... how many attempted 
accesses has it blocked for you?  I noticed the instant I stopped using 
dialup and started using broadband, the number went from constantly 0 to 
about 800/month.  That suggests to me that if you're are a broadband user, 
there -are- in fact 'people lurking in wait'.  Sure, most of them will be 
putzes just knocking to see if anyone's there, but some fraction of those 
probably are, in fact, malicious.  Especially given that turning zonealarm 
off for a couple weeks resulted in rather strange things turning up on my 
PC, like a virus that joins its own irc channel to await further 
instructions... Now admittedly, that had nothing to do with ActiveX, to my 
knowledge, but it does demonstrate that people who presumably have no idea 
who the heck I am -are- in fact lurking, and trying to do bad things to my 
PC.  And it wasted a couple days of my time getting rid of the crappy 
thing.

Quite likely true.  Or he could just ping -f you 'til your connection 
drops.  I agree the risk is low, but why take -unnecessary- risks, however 
low they may be?  And why make 40,000(*) people take them?

}Don't worry, Chicken Littles, the sky isn't falling today.

Plummeting heavens are not my concern.  But computers crashing are. :)
