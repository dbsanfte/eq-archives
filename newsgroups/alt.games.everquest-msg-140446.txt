Alrighty, then.

You've heard the terms before, and we'll see just how big a cunt you really
are. This would serve me a double purpose, since I don't get to travel much
(mainly because I don't have the means) and I would love to see Florida.
Kicking your ass to spend a few days in Florida is a minor inconvenience,
provided I'm not held liable in any manner.

Since you have the means, which you've clearly iterated over and over again,
you pay my way up there and I will gladly "bring it on". What's a few
hundred bucks for you? Peanuts, right? I'll even pay my own motel and I will
also write the release form for you to sign absolving me of any liability
for kicking your ass.

Hey, I'm not TwoHead (who has unequivocally made you shit your pants) so
maybe you'll feel more confident about kicking my butt, right?

I've said little about myself, except that I'm a bum, so you should be very
overconfident in your ignorance.

A few meals at a good steak house for you will cost you as much as a
round-trip ticket.

By the way, let me wrap up any possible "rip me off" excuse you might be
thinking up. Since you are buying the ticket, you will have the itinerary
and can wait for me at the airport in case you feel I might take the flight
and run.

What do you say?
