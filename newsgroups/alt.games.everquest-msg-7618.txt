If I were to make a trade with you and find out that I cant use the item,
and then you not giving me a refund, or retrade, I would be very very very
pissed. Now, if I were to be the one that has to give the refund, I would
probably be in doubt but I would give the guy his axe back. It's better to
make friends than enemies in my opinion. Sorry for the weird reply I'm tired
but it's too hot here and I dont want to go to bed cause I'll get all
sticky.
