Yes, I forgot to mention example zones.
Basically, Kunark...Lake of ill omen is good, OT is not too bad (but the
Outpost is close, if expensive) Dread lands is better, stay by the tunnel to
Frontier Mountains, you may get payed in gold due to the amount of coin that
drops or bronze armour...The pulls are constant so ammo will run out and no
one's gonna want to leave a group, especially as half the zone will be
trying to get thru 45 hell or the 46 penalty level.

I'd just suggest adventuring instead, although sitting in DL's selling
arrows is probably adventure enough for a character in their teens.
