The elems are all good in specific things. This is my personal experience:

Earth has high hp and rooting. good for dungeons and soloing. This one is
basically a meatshield. Worst att but functions as a tank and the root can
save your ass. Especially usefull in the lower levels, later on the root
tends to fail most of the time.

Water has a less hp then earth, immume for poison and got dd spells. 2nd
choise for soloing and best allrounder IMO. the high hp and dd spell make it
a good fast pet against solo mobs with low hp (think caster and rogue type
mobs)

Air has less hp then water, has highest AC of the lot, casts invis on
itself, has minor/medium dd and casts stun. good indoor pet because an invis
pet won't draw trains and the stun helps against fleeing mobs. Also great
against casters because of the stun.

Fire has the lowest hp and ac, but has higher att and has the highest dam
dd. also damshields itself and nearby pets  of your partymembers. Best for
larger groups with player tanks outdoors and campspots indoors.


If I would have to choose it would probably be a water pet, although it's
not a really good one indoors.
But as for now, try all the pets in the lower levels and see which one is
usefull in what situation. You need to research your pets later on and
because of the fails you need to make sure you first get the one that you
want.
