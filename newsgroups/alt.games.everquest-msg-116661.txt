I have not used Linux, I have used various flavors of Unix in the past.  At
home, what I use my computer for is to play games, so I really see no reason
why I would ever consider installing Linux.  I would be quite comfortable
with the process of installing it, and probably would not pay for the RedHat
version if it came to that, but again, I see absolutely no reason to bother.
I do enough programming at work, I don't need to bring it home too.  I have
never used XP, so I can't comment on that, Win 2K has been rock solid for
me.
