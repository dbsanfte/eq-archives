I was soloing similar to this in LIO from level 27 to 29.  I did take
advantage of root and fear (not together, of course, since root negates the
advantage of fear) at times though.  Just depended on the critter.

BTW, troll form at 20 comes in danged handy while soloing.  The regen effect
is very nice.
