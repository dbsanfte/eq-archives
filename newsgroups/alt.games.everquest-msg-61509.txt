While root dot is a possibility, and one that if successful should be
more efficient and allow you to work in closer quarters, snare/DD
kiting is simpler and less risky.

This relies on the fact that you are capable of moving faster
than your target.  You have SOW, pick targets that don't, and
know where the zone line is at all times.  If you are prepared
to run when things go badly then you won't have to worry
about dying and making -negative- exp for the guy as a present...

Ensnare is the spell you want to open with, this has a very good
stick rate, lasts 10 minutes, and slows the target down more
than Snare.

If you fail snare, run until it pops back up and then repeat until
it sticks... if it fails three times in a row you have likely selected
a mob with too much resistance to make a good target, run
to zone and then don't pick on that target again.

Once Ensnare is on, its just a matter of running ahead of
your target, nuking him with Combust, and then running
ahead again, until he turns.  As you know, a fleeing
mob which is snared just stands there "running in place,"
or as I call it, RIP.  You can contine to DD it, one or
two more should do the job, or use a DOT, or even
go up and whack away at it until it dies... depends
on whether this will satisfy your warrior lust for melee,
or make your skin crawl when you see how seldom
he hits and for how little.

DOT on a mob tht is chasing you is actually less mana
efficient than your DDs, as it does only 2/3rds its max
damage.

How to keep from endangering others? Well, pick a
relatively unoccupied area to work in would be the first
step.  Then, look where you are going, not at the mob.
Don't worry, its following you like a wounded puppy.
You don't need to look at it in order to cast your spells.
You will know when it is in range, because when you
mash the cast button and it is too far away, you'll
get the out of range message and it won't cast, no mana
lost...the mob -is- headed your way, just stay put and
keep casting till it -is- in range.  If you want, you can spin
in place while you cast, this will let you see the mob,
and also increase your awareness of other nearby mobs
and possible PCs.

Once the mob is dead, go somewhere nearby that is free
of wanderers, sit down, and enjoy some tells with guildmates
or read the paper or something.  Kiting is a minute of killing
and six of sitting.

Targets: look for things that are yellow and free of faction
hits your friend won't like.  Well, start with blue and work
your way up to make sure you have the technique and timing
down.... but it doens't cost much more mana to kill yellows,
and its more exp, better loot, and more exilerating.  You'll
have to sit a little longer between kills.

Fear kiting animals is more efficient, but more dangerous,
and I'd think you'd want to stick to the simpler action of
a regular kite.  Besides, where fear kiting comes into
its own is when you have a melee partner, who can do
his full damage without taking any damage that you will
have to heal.

You get access to new spells when you hit 34, including
a better DOT and your first potential Quad kiting AOE
nuke... but I don't see  any replacement for Ensnare/Combust
lines, so if you are willing to keep grinding, you won't have
to go find the spells or worry about changing tactics.
