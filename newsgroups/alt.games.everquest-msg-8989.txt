Every few weeks there's a post or two that have this same formula.

What's with all the beggars in <Insert City/Zone>?

I'm starting to think it's all the same beggars with multiple characters.
Some people just automatically think that if you have two of something then
they are entitled to one of that something. I you dare to keep both, then YOU
are greedy.  You may have seen similar attitudes IRL.  I saw a Barb warrior
hanging out at the Ice Giants in EF begging while wearing partial Crafted/Fine
Plate.  When derided for his begging, he claimed he was "just trying to be
nice" so why couldn't the rest of us "be nice" and respond positively to his
requests (begging).  What kind of twisted, idiotic,
dropped-on-the-head-one-too-many-times-as-a-baby logic is that?
