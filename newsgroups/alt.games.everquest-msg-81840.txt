At your level most of the good Paladin quests are still a little out of your
reach.  You could start doing the Ghoulbane quest (which will take you to
Highkeep, great place for exp at your level, I was there from 20-32).  It
will also take you to Unrest, another great spot for Paladins (lots of
undead).  You will need a group in both instances for the mobs required
though.

Have you done your testament quest?  This is a precursor to the Soulfire
quest and starts at the Hall of Truth (forget which Paladin trainer, think
it is the one on the ground out the back).  Very soloable at your level (can
be done at level 10 or so).

Another quest you can start to work on is the Silent Watch Shield, although
unless you have some higher level friends you won't be able to complete this
until about level 40 (even then you will likely need friends).

The armour of Ro quest you could start to work on, but be warned they are
VERY intensive for the reward you get, and most never complete the whole set
by questing.  The armour itself is not the greatest, and unless you buy some
of the components you will ruin faction with the gnomes and faeries, and if
you are a role-player like me I think that sucks.

At about 40 or so you can start on the Soulfire quest.  The weapon itself is
not very good (a Mithril two-hand sword is better) but the quest is one of
the best Paladin ones there is.  Just doing it was reward enough for me.
When not fighting you can also carry it and show everyone (well those that
have particle effects on anyway :-) ) your flaming sword.  It is also a
component for our epic weapon later on (although that too is not the best
weapon out there), the Fiery Defender.

If you are on Mith Marr server then drop us a tell if you see me on and want
help with anything.
