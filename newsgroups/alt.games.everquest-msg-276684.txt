I use all USB, never had any problems with using a USB KVM switch
between several active systems.  Aside from the afore-mentioned second
or two of delay time when switching, it can be a rather viable way of
sharing one KVM between multiple systems.

I have used a cheap (<$40) USB KVM between Windows(Me|XP), Linux,
FreeBSD, and a DreamCast without incident for years.  Last year, I gave
the WindowsXP system it's own KVM; the Linux, FreeBSD, and DreamCast
all still share the same USB Keyboard and mouse, and VGA monitor
through aforementioned switch.

Having said that, I agree that such is not a good setup for
dual-playing.  The delay between switching active systems is too high.
