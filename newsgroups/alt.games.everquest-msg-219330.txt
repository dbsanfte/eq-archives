the relationship between an individual and the society to which they belong is
a two way street. the society has certain responsibilities to the individual,
and the individual has certain responsibilities to the society. one of the
responsibilities of individuals is not having more children than they can
handle. if the potential parents have a big chance of having children with bad
genetic defects, they're being irresponsible to their society by having kids
anyway. society gets to decide what is and isn't considered a big chance, and
what is and isn't considered bad genetic defects. this is the price individuals
pay in order to enjoy the benefits of living in a society.
