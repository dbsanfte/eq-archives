: If all other things are equal (blue mob in both cases), will I get more
exp

levels
: above me?
:

Exp is a function of Mob level (exp points)/number in group and levels of
group members.

Assume you are level 30.

If you are in a group that is all 5 levels below you and the mobs are blue
to you (they could still be red to everyone else).  Mob exp equals 100000
points in this example.  Total exp is 100000*1.8 (which is group bonus of
20pct for each member over 2)  = mob total of 180000.  Divide that by total
levels in group (which is 155) = 1161.3 per level.  Then multiply by your
level = 34838.71 ttl points for you.

Same mob...everyone else is 35...total levels is 205 = 878.05 points per
level or 26341.46 points to you for the mob.

That said, with everyone else higher than you, you will kill mobs faster.
Is it that much far=ster?  Probably, but depends on your level.
