Ok, why and how?

It should be.   Discrimination on the basis of relationship status is
deeply entrenched into our society, but it should not be allowed.   I
think that will be the next big social shift.

We do, at least where I live.  All people of ANY sexual orientation
are protected from discrimination.

If there's a need to explicitly state it, why not?   If a serious and
demonstrable discrimination exists, then why not make a law to
specifically condemn it?  This is an effective tool in beginning
social change.

> People are people.  Whether they be gay, bi, blonde or whatever.

Yes, and until we all move to Utopia we will have to take measures to
ensure that equality.  I don't know if you have ever been
discriminated against, but let me assure you that even with specific
anti-discrimination laws it is very hard to seek justice.  Without
such laws it becomes nearly impossible.

I have, repeatedly.  Because generic statements no not carry a message
for social change, and do not offer support within the justice/court
system.  Since you keep mentioning gay rights, here is a case in
point.  It used to take months- or years- in court to question
Canadian customs practices, because each time the case had to define
discrimination, prove that such was wrong and/or harmful, prove that
discrimination did occur, and prove that such an occurance was
deliberate.   Yikes!   Jump ten years later and much of that can be
skipped by simply quoting the Canadian constitution, which now
explicitely bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
(yes, that applies to bisexuals and heterosexuals too).  Further,
quoting precedent is much simpler when it applies to one law/document,
and you can seek justice in the lower courts, without the need to
address what "should be" law in the upper courts.

> By supporting that, it is YOU who supports bigotry and prejudice.

Wrong.  I do not support any laws that discriminates.  You keep
misquoting laws as giving "special rights" when they do no such thing.
The fact that you are unable to quote such a law (even though they
exist) is evidence that you don't have a leg to stand on with this
argument.    You have also made a shift in your presentation from
opposing "the PC" and "special rights" to sounding very left-wing and
talking about the wonders of equality.

So, if the status quo is INequality and you don't want laws to
enforce/define quality, what would you have people do?   Say, "please
don't discriminate against me again, pretty please?"

I know the reference is dated, but I assume you've heard of "sounding
like  a broken record".   If you can't quote such a law or show cases
where that clearly happened, it may be time for you to bow out of this
argument.   Give it up- you can't prove your assertion that
anti-discrimination laws give anyone "special rights" simply because
that is not the case.  You can't even find exceptions, even though
they do exist.
