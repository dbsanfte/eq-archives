Kerafyrm, the Sleeper has never been taken down. As the story goes, Veeshan
planted her brood on norrath but made THIS dragon WAY too powerfull. It had
to be stripped of most of it's powers, be locked up and put to sleep. Its
guarded by four warders. When you kill the last one he shouts something
about unlocking something you can't possible comprehend and that the very
world is in peril!!! It then promptly destroys everybody in the zone with a
zone wide deathtouch. FoH accidentely woke it up before the scripting was
complete. He was supposed to tear through every zone and kill the whole
server!!!
Hope this helps...
