I thought I didn't see 'em because /who all dru 50 60 showed 'em
in Cobalt Scar killing FOUR FUCKING BLUE MOBS AT A TIME!

God,I can't believe how pissy and whiney this sounds.  With all the
things druids do you want more? It's like necros wanting a more
powerful pet:

/petition "I just can't live with this gimpy pet...I can only solo
effectively
98.7% of the time and actually had to med following a 4-yellow pull
last night.  This situation is unbelievably unfair."

Druids have a bit of everything, and are SICKENINGLY EASY TO
LEVEL POST-14.  This was true 3 years ago and it's true now.
If my rogue misses a raid, she usually gets back to Nexus and camps
out.  To play my druid....who can go anywhere quickly and either
get in an exp group or solo EFFECTIVELY at ANY FREAKING TIME.

People didn't start a druid becuase they loved the RP ideal...they
started a druid to RACE TO 50 AND PL ANOTHER CLASS WITH
ALL THE FUCKING PLAT THEY COULD FARM!!!

They should just give druids /godmode on and be done with it.
