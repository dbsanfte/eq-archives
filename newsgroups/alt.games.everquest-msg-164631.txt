As hard as it is to believe, there are actually people out there who
think they are winning if they are convincing people *not* to read
what they have to say. They seem not to understand the reason for
*being* in a newsgroup. GetsumJ is one of those people. Their poor
human skills and abrasive nature makes it impossible for them to make
any real friends, so they get their social contact by annoying other
people.

Don't you remember back in elementary the kid who got off on annoying
other kids? Well, they grow up to become GetsumJs....
