64 mb of ram is a bare minimum to run EQ.  if you have that low of
memmory, i am guessing it's having to access your hard drive as you say
quite often, which will cause the type of "lag" you are refering to.  If
you have any anti-virus software, etc running exit them before playing
EQ to help free up system resources.  I am guessing also you may have an
older computer all together, and if so you will also have slow downs in
certain parts of the game as your video card will cause a bottle neck,
and you will experience "video lag" where your frames per second will
slow to a crawl.
