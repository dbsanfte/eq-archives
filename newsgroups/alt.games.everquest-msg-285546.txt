After bashing my head against the wall for about 20 hours, I finally got 
the wireless connections working... which turned out to be funny 
settings on my router and my original machines, nothing to do with the 
laptops, which connected at the local McDonalds and via cable to my 
router just fine.

At any rate, I'm now using my LAN to copy my entire EQ file over to the 
new machine, which I hope will save hours of downloading patches.

I'm saddened to read your experiences with what looks like a newer 
version of the same graphics card thats in these machines; the cards are 
not upgradable, so I'll be stuck with whatever they can and can't do.

I do have a backup plan though; while the wife and kids' desktops are in 
sad shape and really needed replacement, my desktop is still working 
pretty well.  It runs EQ now, and should for the forseeable future 
(read, when they come out with the DirectX 10 patch which makes EQ 
unplayable on primative windows XP machines).  So I can just keep the 
desktop and connect while I'm at home, and just suffer like I always 
have while out on the road.
