Odd. Once I identify a fuckwad  or fuckwit (whatever that is) tank who pulls
when the casters are not at Full Mana. I'll ask politely ONCE to check to see
if the casters can handle a pull,. If he doesn't the first time. I'll let him
die the second time, and look for another group.  WHY? Simple really. I've died
far too many times by the irresponsible and / or ignorant or uncaring
selfishness of a tank. BY FAR I have encountered more *fuckwad tanks* than I
have *fuckwad* casters.

So to all you fuckwad tanks out there, ask your casters if they are ready
before you pull. If I don't know you and trust you, my finger is close to the
gate key.  Try to be NICE to the casters in your group. They are ones who will
or will not save your butt.   And wouldn't you really rather have the druid
with his finger near the evac key with enough mana in reserve to save the
team's butt?

Sorry stupid question. A tank, by definition, seems to be incapable of thinking
that far ahead. Oh no shrivelled dick of a 15 Bard has any concept of how a
Druid should play his class. Wait until you are in your 30s and then
pontificate ok? Ummmm. better wait until you are in your 50s.

In summation try communicating with your group members. Develop a plan, an
understanding of who is to do what etc. Or is that too much to ask?  Probably
and is a reason why I am reather selective with whom I group.
