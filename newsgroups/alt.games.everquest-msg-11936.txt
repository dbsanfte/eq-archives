Up to about level 40 rangers tank pretty much as good as warriors,
but get spells too. Depends on your access to decent armour like
Ivy or Banded, of course, but...
 
People hear about the high level game and then retrofit it where
its nonsense. Bizzare. The HP differential just isnt that big before
the lower levels and prior to complete heal its irrelevant anyway.
 
Also get panic animal at level 20 meaning you wont HAVE to tank
unless you want to ;) 
                                           
Track is awesome. RAngers be a lot of fun ;) SoW, snare, self heals,
levitate, water breathing, forage make you pretty much totally self sufficient
if you need to be - not much can kill me unless I'm being goofy (which
admittedly is true a lot of the time) ;)

Harmony & invis combined just make you the most *amazing* outdoor puller;
you can target just about anything and get back far enough to harmony
inside big clusters.

Sneak & invis meant that at level 30 or so when I was fighting in cazic
thule I had no problems whatsoever binding *inside* the evil cities (grogg,
oggok, etc) nice and nearby; when you respawn mem invis, run out and
get back before your beefy warrior has to come all the way from freeport.

Versatility is the name of the game.

It is important, though , that if you're a ranger you pay attention
to your tactics. You get a lot of subtle spells that have more use
than the immediately apparent ones. Make sure you use root to control
aggro - the closest person to the rooted critter will get hit regardless
of position on the aggro list - and try to use good ratio slow weapons
to manage the hate list. Make sure you keep both your 1h and 2h weapon
skills up so you can use the most appropriate weapon for the situation.

Finally... People talk about rangers aggro being a problem. Well, next
time your clerics super aggroed from CH'ing all that warriors HP, sit
back, smile, whack attack and taunt, throw a flamelick and a snare
and then get ready to root the fucker once everythings calm again ;)

Sui, happy ranger, level 51

P.S. Bring a thick skin. Lots of bad rangers out there giving bad
impressions of us crunchietanks ;)
