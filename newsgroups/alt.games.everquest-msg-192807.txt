I was grouping in Plane of Disease, and the puller pulls an Underbulk,
and gets an add pop.  They're both red to me.  I try to mez the
add, and it resists and then aggroes me and kills me.

While I'm waiting at my bind point for a rez, I think about how I
could have handled that differently.  My best guess is that I should
have allowed both mobs to beat on the tank for a bit, and when the
tank had built up enough hate, tash/mez the original mob while
everyone else switches targets to the add.  Underbulks do enough
damage, though, that allowing two of them, unslowed, to freely beat
on the tank is a scary prospect.

Is that the best strategy?  Any recommendations?  If it is the best
strategy, how do I prevent the add from aggroing the healer when
he has to cast CH early in the fight?

(Yes, I know that being the mezzer on red mobs is not the best
situation.  Ideally, I would always be mezzing blues.  But blues
resist sometimes too.)
