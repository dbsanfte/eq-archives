To me faction in DoN is totally irrelevant,you can buy from the
opposite faction DoN Vendor being invis,interesting for example
if you want a second FT3 aug,cause they are lore.
Note that I dont do much DoNs,struggling to finish the Tier 1 quest.
Hanging around in RSS,MPG,RCoD,WoS,even NC all day will yield better 
equipment than doing "Creator" missions for points.
If I could I would give this expansion back,there is no real use,and
if I want instances,there are some in OoW too,personally I still do
Ldons with friends,cause they are fun.
