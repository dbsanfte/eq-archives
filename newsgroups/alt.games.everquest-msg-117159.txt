Indeed.  By making these potions more affordable, they would create a viable
money sink, and possibly increase the number of shammys in the game.  As it
is now, sure, the potions are a money sink, but not one anyone uses.  Hell,
even the smaller ones, like SoW, Breeze, IVU, or Enduring Breath wouldn't
seriously unbalance the game, and still be worth it to carry around.  Then
there could be certain convienance ones, like ultravision for the humans.
Bah, more missed oppertunities for Verant.
