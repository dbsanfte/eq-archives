Hiya,

With my 65 melee, I get 3-4 yellow AAs per LDON adventure.  It takes
typically just over an hour to successfully complete an adventure. 
Lets see what I get during a typical adventure and compair that to
what you normally get during a guild raid:


LDON - 60 -> 80 percent AA per Adventure
Guild Raid - Nothing.  Exp devided between 30 - 40 = nearly Zero

LDON - Deaths maybe 1 out of every 5 - 6 adventures
Guild Raid - 4 - 5 Deaths in one 4 - 12 hour raid experience, and yes
I see alot of you high level uber people naked all the time outside of
the portals so you do die alot, lets not lie and say other wise.

LDON - Loot 100 - 600pp per adventure
Guild Raids - Zero.  Usually the loot whore officers/leaders will say
that it is going into the "guild bank".  "guild bank" = their own
pockets.  This is true.  I know of at least 3 guilds on stormhammer
where the banker gets kicked out or leaves guild and takes the "guild
bank" with him/her!  LOL This has occured with Legacy of Ages
(Rashenal the Bard Kitty Cat, fell out with Wijoko (Monk) and there
was a split ... Rash got the cash!)  Just one example of the 3.

LDON - Drops.  Very nice.  I sell them in Bazaar all the time for a
few kpp.  Made at least 50k pp so far just selling LDON named mob
drops!
Guild Raid  - "Need before greed" = I want that.  DKP = If you have no
life, and play eeveryday 8 hours a day, you will be able to out loot
someone in your guild who works for a living.

LDON - Stress - None ... All Fun!
Guild Raids - stress - Lots!  People cursing ... people fighting among
themselves - people mad that the dropped uber item went to the ass
kisser and not themselves ... just a complete waste of time ... but
they are UBER!

Everything I has stated above is easily confirmed and verified!  Ok,
putting on my asbestos armor cause the truth hurts and I am sure the
flames will be a commin!  :P

Ted
