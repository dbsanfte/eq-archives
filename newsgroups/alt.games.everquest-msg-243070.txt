Umm, common sense, please? Doesn't take an in-depth knowledge of
coding and web hosting to know that it takes a lot less and less
complex code to store and display files than it does to track and
maintain hundreds of thousands of NPCs, hundreds of world zones,
thousands of players, and so forth. And this is just for a single
server.

Subtract the monthly salaries of the GMs and the live dev teams and
other office staff. Then subtract bandwidth costs. There also has to
be enough left over after server maintenance to show a profit every
month for SOE to justify leaving EQ running. The initial sale figure,
they get half of at best, and most of that goes to pay for the
production and marketing of the software. Little, if any, of that
would be allocated to server maintenance. (By the way, it's only
around 430k active accounts)
