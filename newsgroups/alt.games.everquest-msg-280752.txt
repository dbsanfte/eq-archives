Yes,takes any sense of danger out of the game,dive to the bottom of
every dungeon with no need to think of a plan to get back out or what
to do if you die there.

Yes,clicky transport to everywhere,takes any feel of being in a world
out of the game,but I think we  already had this discussion often
enough here,when PoK was released.
Personally I miss ships.

Why is that a good thing ?
FT items for example are much too easy to come by now,again I
admit probably a matter of taste.
But excuse me a FT3 aug you can get for just 250 points or 7
creator missions just plain out proofs my theory,that SOE is
trying to rush the players through the expansions to make them
buy another.

I tried some others,the lavaspinner lair mission come to my mind,did
it twice,both canceled after more than 2 hours,cause we couldnt get
the necessary drops,sorry forgot details.
I know there is a mission in the Ascend,you can finish faster then
Creator,but even this mission isnt done anymore by pickupgroups.

I still like Ldons,cause they require some skill in pulling and crowd
control,although the rewards are not worth it anymore as you mentioned
above,and they need an intermediate leel more than ever withall this
cheap and trivial to get "uber" items from OoW and DoN.

If i were sarcastic,I would say,all this trivialization since PoK was
very succesful in driving players away and reducing the number of
subscribers from 550k to 200k.
