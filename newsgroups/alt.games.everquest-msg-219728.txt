    Well assuming mobs max hit for 900-1k instead of 400-500, we're talking
500hp saved per fight instead of 250 I guess.

    I still can't see that as being even remotely significant. In a planar
group, the healer is going to be a shammy, a druid, or a cleric. Shammies
heal for 1950 (or the use torpor or Q), druids heal for 2900 or something
and clerics 8500 or whatever it is. Nobody's going to notice 500hp every
fight. I should know:  I tend to cast bond of death a lot, which lifetaps
800hp over a minute and I'm pretty sure most healers don't notice that.

    1 or 2k every four fights is a lot closer to "irrelevant" than "Worth
paying 10,000pp extra and sacrificing a small amount of dps for", in my
opinion. The most common cause of death in a planar group, in my experience,
has nothing whatsoever to do with healers running out of mana or healing
being inefficient - it's adds tearing a group apart before a heal, a slow, a
root or a mezz has time to land.

    Nine times out of ten its an unslowed mob that kills you, and riposte
damage vs unslowed mobs would have to be vanishingly small compared to what
the thing's natural melee is doing to you.

    I've parsed the two side by side and yes it's marginal. The price
difference, however, isn't. My advice to anyone would be buy the weapon you
like the most, because the maths put them extremely close in terms of dps
and tanking.

    Confucious say: tank who enrage-suicide and blame weapon still stupid.
