My Wizard is a lvl 34.  I have a great time playing her too..currently my
nukes do 306 (Ice Shock) to 372 (Lava Storm) damage (cannot seem to find the
damn Rune of Conception for Thunderclap, so don't know about that).  I
generally nuke a mob 3 times in a fight, and do not generate aggro to myself
at all, while using appromimately 40%(sometimes 50) of my mana.  That's a
pretty decent contribution to killing a mob, at least where I currently hunt
(OT).  I also have other less damage nukes that I keep loaded and the stun
spells etc.
     I have never been told that I am essentially useless, except once...
and that person made the asshole list in my notebook (yes, I keep track of
that stuff).  Any and all assholes never get a port for jackshit from me,
too bad if your corpse is half the world away and going to rot any minute.
I am too damn "useless" to take you.
     You are entitled to your opinion, of course, but I hope you realize
that there are planes that have nice loot that can only be reached via
wizard...and if I were a wizard on your server I would take the time (since
my class is not really good for much else) to make sure as many people as
possible knew your opinions and prejudices so that when appropriate, they
could excercise theirs on YOU.
