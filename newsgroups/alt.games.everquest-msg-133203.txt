    The power sources are No Rent. He'd either move a character with the
sceptre that summons them to Veeshan, or require Veeshan players that want
one to move to Stormhammer and do the final combine for their VT key on
Stormhammer. No way a Legends GM is going to tell you that you can't go back
with a key, especially since I imagine they cannot verify if you had one in
the first place (or don't check).
