You can also make a Thrugadin Gate Potion.  Two small bits of Velium, One
small brick of Velium, three Crystaline spider silks, two glass shards and a
high quality firing sheet.  It's part of the Coldain Prayer Shawl quests,
details are available on several websites.  It puts you in Thurgadin on the
