One would think so..  me?  Well Im not all that surprised by any acts of
uttermost stupidity nowadays by GMs - it's almost the norm in my experience.

Well to be fair I meant all 3 trials (or in particular, RD - btw flawless
kill that day roar)
Theres 4 guilds on the whole server who has/can kill the 3 trials - by
virtue of the fact only my guild had a force in the zone, the fact we
cleared all other trials that day(incl the other loot item from 3 rooms)
should convince even the biggest disbelievers

My initial instincts (when it was linked to the channel) were "crap", much
the same when any caster loot drops (what a waste, that took the place of
melee stuffs) - but it is a damn nice ring, yes :/

Well Im not an old man like you, and reputation still means something to me!
So I don't think its an age thing
