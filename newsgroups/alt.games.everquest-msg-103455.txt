This one:

# US Code, Title 10 section 311:
#     (a)  The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied
#          males at least 17 year of age and, except as provided in 
#          section 313 of title 32 [32 USC sec. 313], under 45 years 
#          of age who are, or who have made a declaration of
#          intention to become, citizens of the United States and 
#          of female citizens of the United States who are commissioned 
#          officers of the National Guard.
#     (b)  The classes of the militia are--
#          (1)  the organized militia, which consists of the 
#               National Guard and the Naval Militia; and
#          (2)  the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the
#               militia who are not members of the National Guard or 
#               the Naval Militia.

So unless you're a lot younger or older than you sound, you're in the
Militia too.  (Don't get your hopes up over the 32USC313 provisions,
it extends the upper age limit to 64 for former members of the
formal armed services.)

Any other questions?
