That's not the best criteria for making that decision. You should be
looking at the fun the game provides *in general*.

Yes, right now there are a lot of frustrating things going on, but
surely you'll agree Verant is being pretty active at working on them.
In light of that, a wiser decision would be to just not play for a
week or two, and see how well your problems have been addressed.
*Then* decide if the fun outweighs any remaining problems.
