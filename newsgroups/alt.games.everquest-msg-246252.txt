Unreal Tournament, came out in 99, I only just now went to the new
version 2004.

The beef I have is about the epics... this should have been a
freebie...  All that work for some Pithy weapon compared to weapons
you can buy for a few K in the Bazaar.

Just a little sick of the expansions..GoD to me was completely
worthless, and ya my fault for buying... LDoN wasn't too bad, I just
do not care for the non shared point system... (I have alot of unspent
point spread out over separate spots).
LoY was my Favorite expansion in some time... 

just a little buggered up about it all.
