[stupid top posting fixed]

It was made a level 29 spell (IMO) as yet another biscuit to dangle in
front of the low level players who have wizzies to buy an expansion they
have no use for. Wizards and Druids in particular needed another
incentive to fork over the money for the expansion if they were low
level. The rest got the PoK portal system, but people who can port
themselves really don't give a rat's arse about that.

To the OP's question, I think the whole issue of the DS on this spell is
a mistake, bug, what-have-you.  First off, what wizard in his right mind
*wants* a damage shield on him for an hour and a quarter??!!??  Second,
they put it in the same effect slot as the DS of other classes, so a
mage DS cast on a floating wizard overwrites O'Keils's and sends the
wizard crashing to the ground.

And last, yes... the spell effect message is fucked up.
