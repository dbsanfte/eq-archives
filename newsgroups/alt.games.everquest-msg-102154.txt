dopropertinting only works with luclin models. What it does is make it
so if you are a woodelf female druid and wearing the Tov green tinted
BP, your cleavage is no longer an unhealthy green color. It prevents
tinting from armor from also coloring the skin of the area it is meant
for. So it is preferrable.

Because it does not work on older cards, and apparently not even on
the tnt or tnt2 chips even though their drivers are still updated,
verant is going to later give us an option to disable tinting
altogether so you won't be getting your skin colored but you'll just
have the regular luclin leather, plate and chain non tinted textures.
