When I'm in a fast-killing group, we're usually able to pull multiples.  
I get my pet to tank one, siphon strength and dot it, then turn to the 
others, siphon strength on them (unless we have an enchie but 
surprisingly, I've grouped with few of those so far), and suck up some 
life from the tank's mob (who's usually good and aggro'd by then - 
siphon strength doesn't seem to have a high aggro rate, I've noticed) to 
replace what I drained medding up.  My heal at this level is not going 
to do an ounce of difference so I only have that up if we're in downtime 
and the main healer is struggling to heal.  Also, before the fight, I 
throw spirit armor on the fighters and my pet (actually basically 
everybody, since the mana cost is small now) and throw impart strength 
on the tank.  One more level and I get a pretty sweet undead slower (of 
course I'll probably be in HHK by then ^^; but still..), an upgrade to 
my healing and hp-to-mana spells, and shadow vortex, which lowers the AC 
of the mob.  Sure other people can do it all better, but every bit 
helps.

Ryou (there's a charm undead spell too, but who the hell wants that when 
you've got a brand new pet spell with a pet that doesn't turn around in 
the middle of the fight and start helping the mob you're trying to kill? 
:p)
