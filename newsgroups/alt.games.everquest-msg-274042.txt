Your recourse is to take them to civil court.

It really doesn't matter what the TOS or the EULA says.  They're
contracts and contracts are held to be invalid all the time.

I can sign a contract selling myself into slavery, but I would never be
obligated to honor that contract.  The contract itself is illegal.

And I believe that it is illegal to charge for a service and then not
provide that service if you were capable of providing it.

Therefore, any contract which has you sign off on paying for a service
which the service provider may or may not provide solely at their
discretion, I am pretty sure is an illegal contract and would not hold
up in court were it ever seriously challenged.

I would assume that there is no legal recourse for *reasonable* outages
of service due to technical difficulties or upgrades.  However, I would
guess that should Blizzard be proven to have charged a person's account
and then *deliberately* witheld service for an unjustifiable reason,
then they could be forced to refund the prorated service fee for the
duration of the suspension at the very least.
