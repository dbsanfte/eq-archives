I think "all" wolves and bears is not correct, though I can't really back
that up (well, except for Velious wolves, but no newbie should be going
anywhere around THERE :) ).

I don't BELIEVE there's any wolf or bear faction in the Old World (Odus,
Antonica, Faydwer), but one or two particular animals might.

Bottom line is this...don't worry about it.  No matter what you do, the vast
majority of wolves and bears still love you.  My druid still won't willingly
kill a friendly wolf or bear, even after 2 years.
