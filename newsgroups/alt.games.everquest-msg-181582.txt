Oh yeah - I missed your comment about the board being able
to only accept 128Mb sticks.  Usually, this is not true.  I have
seen lots of older mobos that say stuff like that but will work
just fine with 256Mb sticks, either as-is or with a simple BIOS
update.

If you get the RAM from WorstBuy, you can pop it into your machine
and if it does not work, then head up there and return it.  I guess
that's the one advantage to paying their normally inflated computer
prices ;^)
