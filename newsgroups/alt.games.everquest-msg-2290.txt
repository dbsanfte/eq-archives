Yes...so in addition to banning twinks and ebay sales, Verant needs to
figure out the amount of time that the person who spends the least amount of
time on EQ and start disconnecting everybody else who surpasses that.
Err...but if that person is only sitting around and not killing anything
won't that severely affect the "fair share" amount that each player must be
banned for if they go over?  Stop the game enhancements Verant...start
working on that little algorithym.
