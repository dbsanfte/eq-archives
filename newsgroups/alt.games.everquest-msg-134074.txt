I haven't seen much discussion of the UI recently, hope someone has done
the work to produce some good setups or tinkering software for it like
people have for editing chat colors and so forth.

Well I hope there's more documentation on this.  How the heck does it
actually work?  I heard something about having to put items in the trader
packs... ack, my bank vaults are stuffed full of trader packs, am I going to
see every item I've stored in the bank on  the trader screen?

I won't be able to use this as much as many people do anyway, since half the
time when I'm offline my kids are on playing their own characters.  I guess
the best time to go shopping will be late late at night, when everyone would
normally have logged out, but instead leaves their machine running on autopilot
with their vendor alt in Bazarr mode

This may make the new UI usable for me.  I can't deal with stuff on
screen moving under text bars, it makes me woozy, and I can't focus
on either the text or the background.  If I can shove the view into a box
and all the text displays into boxes around that, then I'll love being able
to customize those boxes instead of having to suffer with the plain old
original view I've always used.  In particular, no more groaning about how
I have a sixth of my display eaten up by the fancy class icon (except for
beastlords, who still waste the space but have no icon at all)

Heh, thats the only model I have turned on, turning it off will be a joy!

Thats a bug?  I thought it was a feature!  This is great news though, as a melee

cleric I found this truely annoying, it was either beg for a haste, which meant
wasting mana except from an epic chanter, or give up on melee with a bard
in the group.

mmm, spam reduction

WHAT?  Amazing.  Well thats a heck of a boost to dot classes.  No more need
to root or fear, hate kiting will now be just as effective.  Were Necros
complaining
that they were no longer king of solo?

Bummer, I had no idea we could have been abusing this

Does anyone ever play this song?  I know my bard doesn't, and he's Vah Shir,
with a doubled eating and drinking rate.  Only reason I can think of to play it
would be for those hours long "wait for rare to spawn" camps.

Umm, it was possible to cast bind on someone you weren't grouped with?
Big oops!

That must have been a bit annoying.. but then this spell is only useable for
practical jokes, isnt' it?

This always seemed like an exploit

Oooh be still my heart, the spam lord giveth as well as taketh away

Does SvD help against slows?  Other than that, need to worry about
disease is fairly rare.

That will... help a bit I suppose?

Wow, that will save a lot of time and mana and a good amount of "well he's not
my best but bah" and also the annoying quest to find a player of lower level who

can tell you what level your pet is.

Whoa, thats handy.  Good ones too?

EXCELLENT, my Hammer can be loaded with every buff known to man...
just before he kills himself.

Please someone stop him from killing himself?

On the other hand my druid friend's pet just became a more viable tank,
with Heroism and Marzin and Aegis stacked on there it should be able to
hold its own against a cyan to me mob.  Maybe.  If I keep healing it.  For
a week.

Total waste of time to keep tinkering with PvP.  Oh was that my out loud

Must have been an unpleasant surprise otherwise

But since vah shir bards can wear medium, which is lighter, why would they
want to?  (oh, and note that Vah are the only bards who can wear large)

A major rewrite that should have little effect on game play?   Seems like
a contradiction in terms.

That will be quite handy.  Hmm, even abusive, I'd think.  Let me think about
this some more but it seems to me just on instinct that COTH and /makeleader
stands to allow some funky new strategies
