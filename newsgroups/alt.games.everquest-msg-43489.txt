Clerics, Paladins, and Warriors can't invis without help, while Mages
can't IVU without help.  Since invis fading takes some time, and
you can usually make it to a safe spot if you are paying attention when
it starts to go, avoiding death if spotted is less an issue than (as Monty
Python might have put it) "how not to be seen"

Warriors with the help of a wizzard would still be worse at not being
seen, since they won't be able to reinvis themselves, will just have to
try and bull thru

Really?  Hehe, I think I saw the exit from Seb once.  Been dozens of times.
Course I've always had a porter along, so why bother fighting out?  And
as I pointed out before, who wants to walk to get there (other than the
necessary run from the EJ Evac point) or walk home even if he does
zone out manually?  Port to WC, sell the junk gems, split the loot, and
everyone is good to hook up with their next group... which will presumably
include a porter to get them to whatever far flung point the next fight is at.

I'll grant you that mages themselves are lousy sponges, as long as you grant
me that mage pets are fantastic sponges.  How to work that fact in to your
list, though?  Perhaps add a note as you have for other classes in other
categories (say Mage 3, Pet 9, like you did for Rangers pulling indoor and out?)

No, there are times when the mage pet HP don't count for beans, then again
the fact that the mage can summon a second epic pet for no mana when the
first dies (assuming he prepped before the fight, spent the mana then...) and
then can summon quite satisfactory non-epic pets as well if needed tends
to compete pretty well with dead warriors.

I"m not following you.  Necros would have a hard time buying malachite
because of faction trouble... but necros aren't buying malachite.  Mages
don't have the faction trouble, so no matter how much they would be
having trouble buying because of that if they were necromancers, it is,
as I say, a non-issue.

I've never seen anyone expect a necro to pay for a coffin in my life.  Can't even

I don't pay any attention to loot or money, but I rarely come out of
a camp with under a Kpp worth of goodies.  Hill giants?  Got bored
with that at about 42nd level, at which point the low exp and tiny
loot made them seem silly.

This (Slate kill thing) was a joke.  I agree, on non raid situations, you
won't -need- a  summon, although if the 175pp isn't all that important

A cleric who doesn't symbol his chanter should be drummed out of the
service.  Warriors merely make complete heal more efficient with symbol
up, clerics don't get aggro all that often and when they do they are
at least capable of standing up to a beating for a while unbuffed... but
a chanter, unbuffed, will go out like someone turned a light switch... and
chanters -do- get aggro.  Sure, they can also ditch aggro pretty fast,
but they have to live that long.  Nothing is more important than keeping
the chanter alive (and nothing is more important to the chanter than
keeping the cleric alive.  Its a pact.)

Further (OK, I haven't hit that level yet, perhaps there's a drawback)
clerics get a group symbol that costs only one (or two?) peridot
for the whole group.  Might as well slap that on and get everyone,
I figure... could be wrong though, I suppose.

Doesn't matter, though, for my point, you say that the clerics you
know do symbol themselves.  This being the case, you are looking
at a class with tank level HP and AC, and one that doesn't get
aggro much.  Druids have half the HP and no AC to speak of
at all, the only thing that dies faster if it takes aggro is that chanter
you forgot to buff!

Bored clerics die fast.  They must be under the impression that their
sole job is healing, I love having the heal concern lifted from me since
there's so many other things I can do with the mana if I don't have
to do nothing but heal.

Yes and no, it isn't as important for a big slow two hander approach... and
Verant in their infinite wisdom is making the big slow two handers better!

I"m not suggesting that clerics melee (at 60) is any great shakes, just that
it is potentially a lot better than

I have seen it a lot, myself; not /shout LF warrior for group, but "hey,
do you know a warrior we can get?  and / all warrior 55 60 followed
by /tell Jonboy want to come to Chardok?  We need a warrior.
Of course all my groups have clerics in them, so I'm seeing a different
slice of the world.  All your groups have a shaman in them, so it
makes more sense to take a monk, for example, who will be taking
fewer HP in damage, and benefit more from your buffs, haste, and slow
tactics.

You put ranger in your "tank" list?  Excuse me while I try to restrain
myself from the violent coughing that ensues when I laugh that hard.

5%?  I see about 50% when it works, what are you talking about?  Works
more often than not, worst case its about even which means 25% off... but
really I'd say more like 40%

C2, bard, mages dropping mod rods and druids and shaman healing me up.
Sure, free res would have been faster, but its such a rare occaision and not
all that big a deal.

One mob makes that much difference?  But I'm not talking about the charm animal
line, I mean the regular druid pet, that would protect me from greens while I med,
put more damage in on fear kites, give me an extra "two steps mister" when its
time to run for the zone line... you know, a pet.  Not a hammer that won't switch
targets and dies when my target does.

You don't examine my little example at all, other than to come up with
some offshoot.  There is no healer in my sample situation, its clean and
simple.  Just the two tanks.

Is there a class that can't do crowd control at all by your definition?
Everyone has either root, mes, or tanking ability, don't they?  Hmm,
shaman.  Shaman can't do crowd control?

12 seconds for 600 hp in heals, and remember I'm telling you that
I'm generally FM, so medding isn't going to give me beans.  600hp
600hp 600hp... oops, finally time to CHeal the warrior (who

Except for the healing part.  Reducing the need for healing isn't
healing.  Maybe its, hmm, uptime reduction?  Healer enabler?
Just not a healer.

Doens't address the point: although you can slow damage down and
increase the HP regen rate, if someone needs a heal -now- then the bard
is useless.  Has nothing.  Shaman heals are pathetic... but they can alter
the hurting rate enough and the HP regen rate enough that pathetic is
more than adequate.  A bard partnered with (hmm, whats a pathetic healer
besides a shaman?) a paladin might be able to get by... but then the
Paladin is still the healer, not the bard.  Bards are great downtime
reducers, but they will never be healers.  If you are about to die, what
can the bard do?  Bunches of things, none of them involving giving you
a quick shot of HP to tide you over.
