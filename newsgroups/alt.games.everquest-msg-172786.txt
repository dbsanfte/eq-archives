Hi all,

Been lurking around this NG for years (3) and pulled a lot of good info off
the site. I just wanted to say thanks in that I have found some of the best
hunting site and straight up great general info that has helped me improve
my game play form you all. I even enjoyed some of the more colorful flames.
:)

THANKS!
