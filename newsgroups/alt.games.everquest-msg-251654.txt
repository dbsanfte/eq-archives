No snare reduces the effectiveness in dungeons. The earth pet's root
makes the mob fight to the death.

No form of mana regen beyond modrods. The mob at full speed makes it
hard to aggrokite. The pally has only their innate haste spell and
there's no slow on the mobs.

It'll work, most combos will work, but it doesn't exactly rank in the
top five.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"

- Dolorous Edd Tollett, "Clash of Kings" (George R R Martin)
