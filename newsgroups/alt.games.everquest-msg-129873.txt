I don't know where you got your list from, but if you want to know where
something comes from check www.allakhazam.com. That site has an extensive
database containing just about any known drops en quests in the game.

I didn't get my first magic items before level 16 or so. Before that it was
just cloth and silk (tailoring made) armor. If you want to find some cheap
and easy to get int and mana items I'd suggest you ask around for player
jewelers who can make some low int and mana jewelry.

Also, start saving a bit of your cash and try to buy a Flowing Black Robe
(about 50pp) or such from other players. The /auction channel was created
for this.

If you're short on cash, the best places for lower levels to make some cash
are the Crushbone Belts in Crushbone (sell belts for 5gp - 2pp to other
players) and the Greater Lightstones from Will-o-wisp's in West Commonlands
and other zones. The Greater Lightstones usually sell for about 6-7pp to
players, or you could do a quest in North Karana and get 8pp -9pp per stone
depending on charisma.
Also kill some bears for High Quality Bear Pelts which sell from 10pp to
50pp to players depending on the server you are on.
