Doing some reading this afternoon about the online gamin market  and came
across a discussion on the relative success of a MMORPG called Lineage.  I
looked it up on the web and it looks quite interesting .... perhaps more
interesting from my perspective at a corporate level is the relationship
with "Lord British" himself.  I presume the vast majority of the players are
from Asia given the company's roots ... but not bad to have 4M subs - I just
about swallowed my tongue when I saw that.

Anyway, just wondering if anyone has tried this game out.  And don't worry -
this isn't another one of those "this game is going to be the end of Sony
and EQ - just wait!" posts ... just genuinely interested to see what the
people in this newsgroup think of it ... I actually can't seem to find a
newsgroup for it so thought I would post here.

Thanks and be safe :)
