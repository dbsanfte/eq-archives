LDoN has some stuff that is simply better than Velious gear, and
some Velious stuff you simply can't get in LDoN.

Example of the first - Ritual Claws of the Scion.  Find me a comparable
IDIV item in Velious (go ahead, I dare you :)  The fact that it also has
a type 3 slot means it can be further upgraded to Spell Haste IV.  When
I finish that I'll have my 3 crucial foci on my held gear.

Prior to this my best shot at replacing my summoned bracer was an 
incense burner of Ro - still running 150k on my server.

Example of the second - Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying 30ac, 40% haste,
all/all, a buttload of stats.  If you're a plate class and have haste
somewhere else you can make an equivalent pair, but chain/leather
melee's are out in the cold.

For low level raiding guilds (mine) I really see LDoN gear as complementary
to what I can get raiding.  Since we have scheduled raid nights, there
is a fixed amount of raid gear coming into the guild, and I have plenty
of other time to spend in LDoN or BoT nameds and try to upgrade my gear
there.
