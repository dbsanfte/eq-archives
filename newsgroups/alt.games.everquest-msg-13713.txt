I don't think most people are at that point - most opinions I've seen 
(and I agree with) are "neither side is providing evidence, and rather 
worry about what if *Conquest* is in the wrong, I worry about whether 
Verant is in the wrong, because if they are, I might *have* to leave 
Their world someday".

On another note, how many people viewed the video? I downloaded and 
watched it, and personally, I think Verant should hire them to do 
commercials - that woulda gotten me into EQ a *lot* earlier than just 
waiting for the price to drop did.  I've watched a lot of fan-made music 
videos (anime fan, y'know), and this was *good*.
