    First mana regen spell, by class. To qualify, the spell must give mana
regen that increases meditation rate (so no counting Yaulp for clerics,
which clicks off when they sit):

Cleric - Blessed Armor of the Risen, level 58.
Enchanter - Breeze, level 16.
Wizard - Harvest, level 34.
Druid - Spirit of Ash, level 39 when outdoors; Protection of the Cabbage,
level 59, indoors.
Magician - Rod of Mystical Transvergence, level 56.
Necromancer - Dark Pact, level 8.
Shaman - Cannibalize, level 24.

    So in a discussion about twinking with KEI, which this is, three classes
of seven get left out of the self-mana regen thing until they're high enough
level that they'd qualify for KEI without the grouping trick (two if you're
outdoors, although hunting in Treeform isn't exactly recommended). Let's
compare this listing with the "what melees have no health regen" list, shall
we?

Warrior - none.
Rogue - none.
Monk - Mend, level 1.
Bard - Hymn of Restoration, level 6.
Paladin - Minor Healing, level 9 (technically Lay on Hands, level 1, but I
won't count that as it's hardly regular).
Shadow Knight - Lifetap, level 9.
Beastlord - Minor Healing, level 9.
Ranger - Minor Healing, level 9.

    So by level 9, all but TWO FREAKING MELEE CLASSES have ways to augment
health regen other than bandaging and sitting on their ass. Yeah, life is
rough. Perhaps you should really name this rant, "Why can't warriors and
rogues have what the other 13 classes eventually get?"
