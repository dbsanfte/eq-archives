You're mistaken in a spot or 2 - let's cover the mechanics of XP -

Given :
ML = Mob Level
ZEM = Zone Experience Modifier (examples are 100 in the Hole,
75 in DL, 90 in Umbral Plains)
GB = Group Bonus (1.2 for 2, 1.4 for 3, 1.6 for 4, 1.8 for 5,
2.16 for 6)

The Base XP (B) a mob gives is
ML^2 * ZEM * GB

now, Given
PL = Player's level
SL = Sum of levels for the group
N = number of group members
HCB = High Con Bonus (for players
over 50, any mob within 5 levels of
their level has a bonus that gets
higher as the mob level gets higher.

The XP for the player is
B * ((PL + 5) / (SL + (5 * N))) * HCB

Where
HL = the level of the highest level
in a group
LL = the level of the lowest level
char in a group

then 

LL >= ((HL * 2/3) Round Down)

Sometimes you'll see this as
LL * 1.5, but this misses some levels
where the lower level would get xp.

(namely a 38 does get xp with a 58,
43 with a 65 - both of which I have
empirical evidence of)

So, answer to question #1 is, if the
characters are over 50 the person for
whom it is a yellow con gets more absolute
XP than the higher level person, not just
higher relative xp.

Question 2, yes - the base xp is multiplied
by 1.2 before being split proportionate to
levels.

question 3, the 20 wouldn't get any xp.  Make
the 40 a level 30 and you get - 
Level 20 gets 25/60
level 30 gets 35/60

question 4, Yes - again, make the 40 a 30,
the 30 gets nothing (green mob) and the
20 gets 25/60 of the xp.
