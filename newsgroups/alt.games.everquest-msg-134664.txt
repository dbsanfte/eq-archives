Awww thanks for being helpful... I was going through the tutorial (before it
randomly crashed on me =O)  and it seems to be pretty much like MUDs except
with graphics.  I have been playing MUDs for YEARS... I quit for a while and
started back up recently on Aardwolf... and decided maybe I should get with
the technology and stop using text-based RPGs :)

So if I have been playing MUDs, am I right? Is this along the same idea?
