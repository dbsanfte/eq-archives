If by "stone fist thing" you mean a Fist of Rock, use it instead of the
quest claw.

The only thing I can think of would be to take a trip to the Bazaar
(assuming you have Luclin) and see what you can find that you can afford.
I'm not sure if Beastlords (or Barbarians either, for that matter) can wear
an Othmir Fur Cap, but check and see how much one of those costs and
consider getting one if you can wear it. (Has no graphic when worn, btw)
