   Yeah, I probably misspoke when I said what I did.  What I meant
though, is that if there is an ongoing problem where one or more people
are feeling upset with the way the loot is going, the leader ought to be
doing something about it.  I have been in groups that I know were not
Master Loot, and yet one person was hitting everybody before it hit the
ground.  And yes, I resented it.  The leader is responsible for having
the group run smoothly, which includes looting issues.  The best way to
deal with is to decide in group what the policy is going to be, before
anything is killed, and then explaining the policy to everyone new that
shows  up.

   But yeah, unless the gl can reach through the phone and strangle an
idiot, then yes, bad players can and will mess things up and there is
nothing the gl can do about it.
