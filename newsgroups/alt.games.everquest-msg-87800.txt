Agreed.  I started playing about a year ago, and have started many, many
different race/class combinations just to see what they're capable of.
After a year's worth of gaming, my main is a 37 druid that I started just
before Thanksgiving.  My first character is still alive (lvl 24 ranger), and
my other characters range in lvls between 23 and 8.

What I play on a given night depends on the mood I'm in ... if I feel like
grouping, the Cleric's at the spires in SK.  If it's been a lousy day and I
just want to nuke the crap out of stuff, the lvl 13 Wizard comes out to
play.  If I'm just in the mood to kite/travel/help newbs, I'll pull the
druid.  Last week I went to Freeport, did a "/w rouge 1 5", found a lvl 2
rogue who wasn't twinked, and gave her a Walrus Tooth.  After that, I hit
her with Skin Like Steel, Strength of Stone, SoW, and Regen ... and told her
to go have fun.  She was smacking every bat, rat, and orc pawn in sight
shouting "I'm Invincible!" every so often.  That was the most fun I've had
in a while.

Some nights are just mindless tradeskill nights.  I don't feel like the
hassle of a potential corpse run, so I'll just cook up all the meat I've
acquired or buy spiderling silks from newbs and tailor for a while.

I heard a guildie say the other day that he'd love to start a ranger, but
didn't want to go through the "1 - 30 grind" again.  After a year, I have
just the one character that's 30+ ... and it hasn't seemed like a grind to
me.

You get out of it what you put into it, I guess.

Crash
