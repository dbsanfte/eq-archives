Mobs are generally slower than SOW/TBoot/JBoot.  Soloing
without a speed enhancer is... possible but not at all optimal,
anyone who actually plans a solo carreer should probably
look at some way to outrun mobs as their most important
expense

SOW potions are cheap, you can certainly afford them by
your mid 30s.  This seems like a lot of levels, but if you
look at it in terms of days played , its a twentieth of your
play time till 60... and there's a lot of game left at 60.

Pick a different spot, different mob, different place to pull
to, learn more about pathing in that area, and spots
you can pull from, so on and so forth.  If you name a level
I can probably tell you some mobs you can safely pull but
there will be tons more I'm not familiar with.

LOIO, FM, OT, Iceclad, EW, GD... outdoor areas with spots with
no roamers.  Move forward into a roamer area, make sure your target
is alone, pull it back to the no roamer area, kill it.  Med up if
needed,
repeat.  Helps if your "pull to" area is near a zone line for those rare

occaisions where something pops while you are pulling... but then you
have to worry about being trained.

Take EW alone, lots of spots:  Off the bridge to Iceclad, for example,
you'll see lots of mobs ranging from blue to light red who travel alone,

and the bridge up past the snow line has no wanderers and makes a good
long kite area (not that you need space as a mage)  Alternately you
could move up to the walrus area and pull walrus and ulthork out
either bridgeward past the tree, or on the far side out past
the coldain camp, or you could go to the GD zone line, that whole
ramp is roamer free and free range mobs wander all over just up the
hill, or you can set up camp at the CC line and fight in that little
building (use invis to get there) pulling RyGorr Centurions from the
area outside the fort building (hope someone else is pulling elites
and legos so you can make a bargain to get all the cents and yet
don't end up with a full spawn of the big boys)

Invis up and wander around interesting zones, look at zone
lines or corners mostly and watch them for a while, see if
you can find places with no static mobs in them and no
roamers coming in range.  This sort of spot is really quite
common, although I've yet to find a map site that lists them.
