Why? Did you not play during that period? Were you not informed of the rate 
increase? If you *didn't* play, did you remember to cancel your account? 
You knew the cost. Why try so hard to "get over"? Their "screw up" didn't 
cost us anything. We are merely being charged what we were supposed to be 
charged.

We played. We should pay what we agreed to pay. Sure, they made a mistake. 
Sure, it would have been viewed as quite the act of positive customer 
service had they just decided to move the instatement of the rate increase 
back a month or so (actually, you probably would have had little good to 
say about that, either, likely opting to comment on "what dufusses they 
must be" or "typical SoE inefficiency" and/or "inaccuracy"). That doesn't 
make it any more right to not pay the agreed amount for services rendered.

Sometimes I'm just amazed at the things about which many in the EQ 
community tend to get bent out of shape.

Btw, dispute the charge, and you will likely be complaining from the 
sideline next month after they cancel your account for non-payment. Your 
call.
