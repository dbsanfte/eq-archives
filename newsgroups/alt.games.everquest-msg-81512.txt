 I just installed the game on a new Compaq and when I get to the 
server the screen is all screwed up. The left side of the screen is
ok, but the right side looks like it is overlaid with another left
side. (kinda hard to explain). 
 When I get into the game the right side of the screen is messed up 
so you can't get to the combat,abilities etc.
 when you look in the inventory there are even different pictures
of some of the items.
 I'm running windows xp with a S3 Pro Savage KM133 graphics .

Just wondering if anyone else had this problem and what they did
to fix it
                     thanks for any info      Ray
