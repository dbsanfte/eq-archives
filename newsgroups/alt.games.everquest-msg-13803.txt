Yes.   A kill by a group that has nobody the mob was blue to will get a "This
combat was trivial for you" message, and will not receive any items the thing
would have dropped marked Magic Item, Lore Item or No-Drop.

Sorry, no.    First of all, it makes no sense.   In Verant's perfect world,
there are no customer service calls.   Why not?  Because the more CS calls
(petitions) they receive, the more GM's they have to hire to answer them, and
the less money they make per month.  To think they would then implement a
"feature" of a zone, which requires that valuable CS time to get the player
out and back to playing again... well, that would be self defeating.


Anyways, I've been to the Warrens once myself, with a level 48 warrior.   Why?
Because I had never been to Paineel before, and the entrance to the warrens is
in roughly the same location as the entrance to the Hole, which we were
raiding that night.  I did not end up in any little room.   I had previously
done the optional patch.
