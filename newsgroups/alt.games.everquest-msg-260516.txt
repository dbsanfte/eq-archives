> Camps?  Have names spawn randomly in the zone from any mob.

I remember that this idea discussed by the devs and rejected on the basis 
that players want a reward at the end of a challenging road, they don't want 
to knock themselves out clearing a path toward some obective only to find 
nothing at the end, while someone else is generating big rewards by randomly 
killing something along the way. They opted instead to make a clear path to 
the pot of gold, and it's tough in that case to prevent camps. How do you 
solve for both problems?
