I was having this discussion with my guild earlier. It's been the topic
of much debate. The new levels of 61 through 65 not only came out with
PoP, they are (IMO here, of course) designed pretty much solely *for*
PoP. If you are not in a guild that's able to go to the tier two, three,
and four planes (and eventually Plane of Time) then there is apparent
use for most of it. At least not past the first couple levels.

Sony looked to the future and was smart. (As much as it pains me to
admit it.) By shrinking down the number of levels that you get xp from
below your own beyond 60, they attempted to keep the super high level
PoP players from simply farming and dominating the old world content,
effectively forcing them up into the new planes. So if you are in a
smaller guild that won't make it up to the green fields of endless
spectral parchment drops, then I don't see much on the plate for you.

I already made the decision to stop normal xp when I get to sixty until
I get the most useful set of AA skills at 100% AA. Then, if I still
don't have sunstrike, I may move on as high as 62 to get one new wizard
nuke. But as long as I stay in my current guild, and all we can aspire
to is things like *someday* killing the bigger velious dragons, then
going up to or near 65 would be doing nothing but screwing myself over.
