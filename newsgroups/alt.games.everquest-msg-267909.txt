Yes.

EQ2 probably can benefit from xtra v-ram. And if your running textures 
at max, it probably will make a difference.

However, that said, the OP was running in low-res modes and still 
getting barely playable performance. In his case the jump out of the 
5200 to the 5700 would account for almost all his performance boost. I 
remain confident the v-ram was not the bottleneck.
