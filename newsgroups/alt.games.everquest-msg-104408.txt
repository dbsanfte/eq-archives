Yeah, but that's where that nice group heal spell comes in handy,
doesn't it? (what's it called? Word of Health or somesuch?). Then again
I don't seem to recall it moving my HP bar very much on my tank, so I'm
not sure how effective it would be on casters in Seb given the damage
those frogs and bugs can lay out. What were you using primarily?
