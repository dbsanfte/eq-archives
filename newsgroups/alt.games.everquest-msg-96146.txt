The antechamber outside of VS's room (sometimes called the
pit or dropoff) has a safe spot, where the druid or ranger
can wait. (I think it's along one of the walls near a corner
in there. If you don't know the spot, I recommend going to
the dropoff as an exp camp before you are ready for VSR to
watch mob pathing and see where you can sit safely.)

I'm not sure how things work on your server, but usually one
person (the person who needs VSR) camps the antechamber. The
camp is usually called "VSR".

If VS spawns, you call your guild or friends or whoever is
online to help you clear him. It's generally considered good
taste to allow the Druid or Ranger that was there before VS
spawned to continue camping for VSR after the raid.

If VSR spawns, you call your guild or friends and get your
epic piece. If you are unable to muster up enough people to
kill VSR (it only takes like 2 groups), you may have to
forfeit the spawn and try again.

The camp usually involves the Druid or Ranger player staying
awake and online for a couple days in the antechamber.
However, if you have friends or guildmates, often they can
take a shift for you on a long camp. This is similar to
(although somewhat easier) than how the last step of the
Cleric epic (Ragefire camp) used to work before the recent
change.
