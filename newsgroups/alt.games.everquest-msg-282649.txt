Um, yeah.   Before you ride away on that there high horse, perhaps you should
learn a bit of the backstory.  I was not making fun of slow levelers or
insisting everyone needs to be a power leveler, or whatever else you seem to
have come up with.

I was just poking a bit of fun at an old newsgroupie, because over the years,
he has kept pulling that character out as an example of a warrior soloing (or
any class soloing, depending on which discussion it is at the time.)     But
at the same time, his soloing days from his warrior appear to be all in the
(now distant) past.   I still find it amusing that he keeps using that
character as an example of the viability of warrior soloing, while at the same
time his apparent lack of desire to continue soloing the character speaks
volumes on its own of  how fun that experience must have been.

So, for next time, I'd suggest not leaping to conclusions quite so quickly.
