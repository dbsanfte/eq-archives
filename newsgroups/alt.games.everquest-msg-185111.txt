Ive hunted here quite a bit and the aggro radius isnt that large (ive
seen much worse), and the assist range is even smaller. I can easily
pull one out of a building when they are standing next to each other
without a lull or harmony. Pathing, however, bites the big bippy here.
Pets seem to have problems too on some of the docks and boats.
Sometimes its fine, other times, my girlfriend's shammy's pet seems to
inexplicably die on the boats. She'll summon and.. poof... gone.
