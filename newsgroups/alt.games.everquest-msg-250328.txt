Actually, I don't think there ever was one.  I started playing about 
midway between Kunark release and Velious release.  Lots of people claimed 
that LOIO was superlative exp on the grounds that it was an Iksar newbie 
zone, and common wisdom was that all newbie zones had a higher ZEM.  Bu 
this was a time when ShowEQ was not widely used, and the actual numbers 
were rarely widely spread around, if they were even known.  Eventually, 
numbers did become widely known, and LOIO was found to have a 75 ZEM, like 
most outdoor zones.

But the fact remains, mobs in LOIO are really really easy to kill in 
quantity.  I never saw a point when I was getting less exp per mob than 
the last time I was there.  But the fact you could chalk up a lot of kills 
in a short time means that the exp overall was (and still is) pretty darn 
good.

It's always possible, though, that it was getting a newbie zone bonus, 
since I didn't have any good numbers either.  But if so, it went away 
sometime around when Velious came out.
