Cazic Thule decided to pop into Lake of Ill Omen (apparently drawn by the
constant shouts of "you Sux0r" and
"Ya mom") He originally asked for Sarnak Blood but was, of course, attacked
and that was the end of his quest giving (and pretty much the event) one
person after this was able to sacrafice his own blood but no further was
done on that, even tho constant vain attempts were made to RP the situation
he had had enough and just played with people after that (aoe fear, knock
downs, silence and, the best, a knock back that sent me over the otherside
of the lake...<teletubbies voice> again, again)
Question, I believe this event also took place on other servers, anyone
manage to make anything of it?

Personally, I think putting CT on Norrath in a neutral zone is going to get
him attacked but I'd imagine, had it been any of the good Gods the result
would have been the same.
