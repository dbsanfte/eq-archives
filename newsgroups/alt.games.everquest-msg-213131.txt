Is your soundcard on board or do you have an actual sound card installed
like a Creative Labs Soundblaster or a sound card from Turtle Beach?  If it
is onboard then I recommend disabling it and buying a true soundcard.

I agree.  Get rid of the RamBooster.  From your description I would guess
the freezing is do to background applications running.  Windows 2000 allows
you to setup hardware profiles.  Within these profiles you can tell windows
what services you want to load and what services you want to keep turned
off.  I would create a hardware profile for gaming that has everything that
is not needed to run games turned off.
