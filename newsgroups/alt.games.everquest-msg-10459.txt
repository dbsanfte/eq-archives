LOL.  Actually that is a pretty crappy way to earn mony.  I had to camp in
ferrott one night for Fear the next day and decided to go kill HG and buy
Peridots with the money off the gnome in RM.  It was slow going, first you
gotta find one cause it's ususally camped to hell, and a lot of the times
they don't drop jack.
