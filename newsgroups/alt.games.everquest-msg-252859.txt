Hey Faned!  Me too!  You'd probably cite something that sounded good
but was completely inapplicable to the case at hand, ignoring in the
process basic law that *does* apply to our dispute, thinking that
sufficient and then not only would I easily defeat you, but everyone
would have a good hardy laugh at your expense!  Except your client,

Copyright Law that (blah blah blah as you get drowned out by everyone
in the courtroom laughing at you)"
