I wondered for the longest time what was going to happen when I finally
attained the Shaman class AA, Cannibalization (aka Canni V). Would I get a
spell scroll that I could scribe into my book? Would it be an item that I
could click? Or what. Well, I finally attained it and I learned that it's
just an AA ability that can be activated via a hotbutton supplied directly
out of the AA dialog box. The button can be moved like other buttons and
placed in my hotkey banks. The trouble is, this doesn't fit well with the
scheme I'm currently using in my interface for my fingers. I generally
create socials with prepatory moves and messages and then link these to
hotkey buttons.

I'm wondering. Is there a way to access this ability from an in-game macro
(by this I mean the usual 5-line social buttons). I know about /memspellset,
and /doability, and I've tried a lot of different things along these lines.
But is there a way to access an AA ability via these little scripts, so that
I could do something like:

/stand
/em nibbles a huge chunk out of his arm and then repairs the damage ...
/doAAability 1   (<----- Canni V)
/target Winterfury
/cast 1 (<---- Quiessence)
