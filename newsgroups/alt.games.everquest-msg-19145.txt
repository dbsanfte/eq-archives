The only mob in all of iceclad, eastwastes, great divide, and thurgadin
that sees invis are the kromrif death squad members.

Invis is incredibly powerful in velious. Almost no undead on the entire
continent, and many of the undead that ARE there, still cannot see through
regular invis.

Assuming that it doesn't wear out at the wrong time, theres no reason that
a level 1 cannot safely get to thurgadin with invis.
