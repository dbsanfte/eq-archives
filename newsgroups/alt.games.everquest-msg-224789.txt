Thanks for that - I just got back and was given the green light to continue
working ; )  I think my insistance on wearing terribly loud Hawaiin shirts
during crucial meetings with Psychaitrists and Uni Directors paid off:
"Yep - he's a nutcase, but a harmless nutcase and amusing in a pathetic sort
of way...".

: )

Woooooooot! Ahh it is so good to get rid of something like that hanging over
your head, I think I will be having a Brewery or several over the next few
days to make up for lost time.

*dances a rather unco-ordinated jig*
