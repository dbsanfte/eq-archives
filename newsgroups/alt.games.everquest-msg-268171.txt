Heh i can tell you exactly what it is since I was there at the time. It 
allowed you to bypass early tracking software and bad word filters.

Not allowed to call someone an ass but A$$ gets by the filter . Just like 
sh*t , c{}nt , etc ...

If you where doing or saying something that could get you in deep sh*t you 
used it .

Same concept still used in mainstream albeit obnoxious behaviour today. Ever 
noticed how obnoxious email spammers have a random unique email address? You 
cannot block them easily. Ever notice a spam message with several pages of 
garbage after the message? They do that so that spam filters cannot block 
them.
