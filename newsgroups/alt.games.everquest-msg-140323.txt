I was just comparing the lvl 44 spells as an example (Calefaction is my best
Nuke atm)
Above 44, Druid nukes do get better... and Vs Summoned, Druids stil get
slightly better/earlier nukes... but the idea that Clerics aren't Nukers is
a bit of a myth :o)

/agree... but they DO kinda suck when you're being smacked about for double
100s by a mob with 2k HP... he's done 10k worth of melee damage to you in
the time it takes your porcupine to bring him down to 50% :o)

/agree... but the point was that Clerics not only CAN "create food and water
out of thin air" but do it better than Druids (who only get the basic summon
food/water spells)

Druids can at least track Quillmane :o)

Dizzying Wind (lvl 19)
Breath of Karana (lvl 56)
... both outdoor only, 2 sec stun, knockback and DD.

If they had any brains, they'd be ShadowKnights :o)

Okay... that WAS a little weak :o)

My point is that Clerics can either do everything a Druid can do...
sometimes better... or if not, there's usually something out there that
gives Clerics the ability to do anything a Druid can do, except Track.

Conversly, the main thing that Clerics can do SO much better than Druids is
heal... and there's not a damn thing can be done to fix that :o)

Don't get me wrong... I love being a Druid, it just bugs me that there are
so many assholes out there screwing about that leave us with a rep for being
'no brainers' and a class only suited to idiots. Being a Druid can be
tough... is it any wonder we hug trees when nobody else wants anything to do
with us? :o)
