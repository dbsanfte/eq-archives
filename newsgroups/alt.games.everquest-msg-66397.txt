OK? ....No

Fair?....No

A Fact?...YES

Actionable (eq lawsuit)?...No

That "Someone" can take the game back to the store or contact Verant
for a refund. No crime was committed. 

That same "Someone" will be just as screwed when the next DX8.1 only
product hits the shelves. The only difference being that the box won't
say Win95 is supported.

So at what point does this "Someone" accept the fact that Win95 is an
obsolete OS for gaming? They can make the move and upgrade now, or
they can upgrade later. At some point they will be forced to upgrade.
Verants sudden move may be "unfair", but it is not unrealistic.
