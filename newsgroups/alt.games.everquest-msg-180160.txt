Yeah, found that out this weekend, never bothered me before because I guess
my Warrior always resisted it, now I'm there with a lower level Ranger it's
a bit different...Funnily enough, I don't think the ones in SD do this (they
are far tougher than DSP's variety) as some of them are still blue to my
Warrior but have never stuck a blind on him.
When you are blind you are also deaf, you notice, you can't see text to see
chat or combat messages :ï¿½/
