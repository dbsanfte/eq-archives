Once we have the system established, and the R&D on the basics is done, I
seriously doubt it would cost as much to upgrade the system as it would to
build new missles.  And every missle stopped is how many more lives saved?

Given Russia's economy, it wouldn't be too difficult to convince them that
the money is better spent in their own ABM.  The existance of a U.S. ABM
would set the cost/reward ratio much higher than it already is.  There's
only so far they can go before it ends up being a loosing proposition.

Dismissing it as a scific scheme doesn't make it so.  You talk about
scrapping the whole lot of them, but you surely understand that that will
never happen, even if the U.S. were to destroy every missle we ever made.
I'll take a proactive engineering solution to wishful thinking.
