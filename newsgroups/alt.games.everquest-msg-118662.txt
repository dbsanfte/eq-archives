They can't audit you without a courtorder or your permission. And they're
not likely to show up and ask you to allow them to audit you; the cost to
audit every company that they mail to would be prohibitive. Add to that the
cost of getting a court order, which they're not likely to get because they
don't have any evidence against you, if the company refuses and you can see
why they're relying on bullying companies into just going ahead and buying
licenses to be on the safe side.

I'm just saying your company can afford to throw away anything that BSA
sends to you because even if you aren't in compliance there is nothing they
can do about it. Unless you fall for the self-audit bit and tell them that
you're not in compliance.
