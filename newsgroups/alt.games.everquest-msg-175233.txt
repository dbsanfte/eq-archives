On a related note, Dont forget to do the Stien of Moggok Quest.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=13

Its not often you find a FREE +10 int item,

Darkelfs can do it from lvl 12 onwards, and and other races lvl 16 onwards,
You dont even have to kill anything just mem a few illusions and run some
zones, Pre-PoP took my chanter about 1 1/2 hours per attempt without druid
ports, with PoP a max of 30 minutes if I amble =)

Oh and if anyone on Karana Server wants a Free one of these Just send a tell
to either, Hanekstar, Starrfists, Starrdancer , or Starrfoot.
