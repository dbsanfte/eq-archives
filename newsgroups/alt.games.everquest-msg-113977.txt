No, this means FoH (or AL, or Triton, or any of the other groundbreaking
'first kill' guilds) spent lots of time and effort killing some of EQ's
toughest mobs, and found the loot to be below expectations for the
encounter. Result? High end player base in general has no incentive to
kill these 'uber' mobs more than at most once just to say they have.

There are 2 reasons to kill an ubermob once exp it taken out of the
equation:

1: The Challenge 
2: The Loot

Once you've killed it once or twice, you know you can kill it, so the
'challenge' is debatable. The reason mobs are killed after the first
time is the loot, and the increase in power that loot affords your
guild. Increasing in power means access to more challenging mobs.

It wasn't their 'whining' that got the loot changed as much as their
honest opinion collectively that it wasn't worth killing him more than
once or twice, and only then for the achievement factor. They could
quite easily skip over the mobs and kill other stuff more beneficial in
general to their guild. VI want these mobs (and the challenges) used to
keep the players interested. Having them universally labelled 'not worth
the effort' means they won't be killed.

FoH have complained for years about large-race slam not being universal,
and there's no evidence of them being pandered to on that, so I disagree
with your assumption that FOH gets whatever they want simply by
complaining. They may seem to get more action, but that's generally
because they (and others) are the first to point out serious flaws of
risk vs. reward in the high end (headline making) game.
