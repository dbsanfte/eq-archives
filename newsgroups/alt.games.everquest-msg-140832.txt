First off, yes I use EQW. At first I installed it so I could stay in trader 
mode and my family would still be able to use the computer whenever, but I now 
use it all the time. I like being to use AIM or look at a webpage while playing 
EQ.

That being said, I'll get to my question. Since their support forum yielded no 
response maybe someone in here can help.

I recently got a new hard drive so I could reinstall my OS on it. EverQuest has 
been installed on a secondary drive all along, so putting a new drive for the 
OS didn't require anything in EQ to be reinstalled. Previously when running EQ 
in EQW I could switch to another program (AIM, IE, etc.), then switch right 
back to EQW easily. Ever since this reinstall when I click the EQ button on the 
taskbar I must wait a good 5-10 seconds before the window is brought to the 
front. I don't minize the window ever, I just bring other things in front. It 
used to work fine, but now I gotta make sure I'm in an entirely safe spot when 
I switch to another window because I can't instantly switch back if I hear 
bone-crushing hits being landed on me.

I have since moved EQ from the second drive to the primary drive, the new one, 
which contains the OS. The new drive is using NTFS (because XP didn't give any 
other options) while the second drive is still using FAT32. The previous drive 
with the OS also ran FAT32. I wasn't sure whether this would affect things any, 
that's why I moved it to the new drive. It didn't help the problem any, 
however. No hardware has changed or anything, so I am unsure of what I might be 
able to do to resolve this annoyance.

Anyone in here use EQW and seen or heard of a similar problem?

Thanks :)
