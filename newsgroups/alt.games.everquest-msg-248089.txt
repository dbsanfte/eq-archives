Okey... Since there is no appropriate forum for CoH stuff yet (that I 
know of), and the in-game chat tools leave a lot to be desired; but on 
the other hand a.g.e regulars are probably getting sick of all the off-
topic CoH chat going on over here, I thought it would be a good idea to 
consolidate the CoH stuff in one thread that could be conveniently 
ignored by those who don't care.

Anyway, to get the ball rolling, I think I'll mention the obvious: Who 
else would be up for an a.g.e Supergroup in Protector?
