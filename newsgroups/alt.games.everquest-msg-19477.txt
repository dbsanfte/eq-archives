Hehe, yep. Its even more amazing when people start begging the wrong classes for
sow or buffs.
Had a level 17 rogue wood elf, standing in 4 pieces of Ravenscale (including
breastplate), with a Harpoons of the Depths in one hand, Tombcarver in the
other. On top of that he was dead drunk, so swaying from side to side.
Had a dwarf ask him for sow for 5 min before leaving, because she could not read
my answers since i was so drunk (hehe, was before i learned of the /em command).

But the price for the most stupid begger go to one who asked one of my friends,
a level 1 untwinked bard, for a rez.
