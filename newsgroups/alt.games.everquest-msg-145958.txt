I can't remember ever using this line of spell much at all when I was at
this level or for that matter any level (except on myself for the ac :) )
Even with 3/4 melees in group I would  always cast Celerity which has more
than twice the amount of haste than augmentation. Mobs drop quicker, xp is
faster. All this and doing CC on sometimes 4 plus pulls - though you may
have a problem if the puller is constantly pulling multiples ;) If you need
to regen a bit of mana, just ask the puller to try and pull singles for a
while. As you are hunting in DL  then getting hold of the Wanderin Mind (39)
spell would be very useful if you have problems with mana depletion as the
spiders there are casters and you can drain some back.

If mobs drop quick dont bother slowing.

Cheers
