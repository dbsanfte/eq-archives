Well for reasons already posted (by myself and others) I don't really post
magelos, character and AA information etc.. and least of all on a regular
basis.

If YOU were more clued up, you would realise my posts (do a search for any
replies to Monual in recent weeks, or the Uqua thread) typically refer to
the highest level mobs and zones in the game.
I don't expect you to know about zones 10 tiers above where you play.. zones
you can't even imagine to reach in your dreams etc.. but heres some advice:

If i was going to call somebody out for being a noob (and i quote, "I know
more about classes than YOU'LL ever know").. i would damned well do a little
research on things like "plane of time".. "ikkinz".. "uqua".. just to make
sure I knew what these unfamiliar places were, before I launched in with
some baseless accusation which was going to make me look really stupid.

I guess another reason is most of my posts nowadays are generally replies to
people I consider "friends" in the NG.  Responses to friends / answering
basic noob questions are places where I don't typically have to offer my
"credentials"..
The days of debating any and all arguments pretty much ended for me when
other highly-knowledgable, smart, intelligent and friendly people stopped
posting here (Ben, James to name just 2)

So yeah my posting is down on old levels, because people like Cel and James
aren't around much now, for us to have long pointless threads of friendly
chatter + some mild eq related theme

You know the onus is really on you here to do proper research before flaming
somebody.  Ignorance is no excuse when you start tossing insults around.

If not you just look an even bigger ass.

He's not a fanboy... he tried to highlight your errors to you and stop you
babbling and making an even bigger fool of yourself.
And hey, had nobody responded to "vouch" for me.. would that not have been
part of your proof how "unknown" i am here?

Can't win huh.. if people don't post, you were right, im a nobody, nobody
knows me or my characters. If people do post, well they are just fanboys..
you are still right.. im a nobody with admirers.. or something

Maybe you should look into the reason why people DID post about me.  Kaev,
Rem and Davian aren't flamers or trolls.. they posted to correct some bs you
were spouting.  Sure you can label them all fanboys and disregard them too..
but then you look like an even BIGGER dumbass when it finally sinks in...
Assuming of course, you have brain cells to digest this information and
finally make sense of it.
