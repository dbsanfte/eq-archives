Well, as 42 has also mentioned, those features you mention hardly qualify 
as new content. They were each little more than single compelling features 
to entice players of all levels to purchase expansions that were geared 
primarily to the high level player.

Those were the types of features that a MMORPG should push out in patches, 
not use to squeeze money out of your customers that have little reason 
otherwise to purchase the expansion.
