I think you misunderstood his post.  He is saying that attacking exactly the
same mobs as he did at level 12, he now has problems with using the exact
same spells.  He says that his Grasping Roots spell is resisted far more
than it was at level 12, when cast on the same mobs.  My guess is a
temprorary run of bad luck with the RNG.
