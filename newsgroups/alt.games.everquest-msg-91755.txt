Each time I run the patcher, it attempts to download spdat.eff (for example,
it will download it once when I connect and second time if I immediately do
a complete file check). I normally wouldn't care except that I can't seem to
connect to the servers ... I go through server selection & start the
connection process but get disconnected just before I'd normally go to the
character selection. Presumably some CRC on the files is failing.

I've done the obvious things: delete spdat.eff, scandisk, slaughtered a goat
and spread the entrails on the keyboard, etc. No effect except the
qqqqqqqq-key is a little sticky.

Anyone else having this problem? Also could someone check their spdat.eff
tell me the length and timestamp.

FYI, my version of spdat.eff is is 3,197 bytes long, timestamped 2/25 @
