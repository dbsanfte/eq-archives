We were talking in guildchat about PB AOE and how only a limited number of
mobs will engage you at once, and I mentioned wondering if there was an
exploit there: get some low greens on you when traveling through a dangerous
place, so the high level mobs can't attack you.

Someone in my guild reported they had checked it out, and it worked.  They
aggroed some Snow Bunnies, and then strolled around in the Ry'Gorr fort with
no problem.
