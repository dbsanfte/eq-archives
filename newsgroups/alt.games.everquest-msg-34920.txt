Hello,
My level 10 human wizard has been in freeport his whole life hunting in east
commons mostly and once in awhile venturing into West commons and North ro.
Is their another good place I could travel to without fear of dieing along
the way. I ventured into Kithicor forest by accident at night and was picked
off at the entrance. Some people tell me go through their at daytime and you
are fine and other people say it is just as bad.

Also can anybody recommend a good one handed weapon for my wizard to use. He
has been using a giant snake fang all his life and other hand carrying a
shimmering orb. Is their something better I might use. I have 130pp to spend
as of now. Any help appreciated.

Thanks

Fenadorn
10th level wizard of The Rathe server
