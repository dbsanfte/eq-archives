There are a lot more than that, and the sheer amount of letters from EMPLOYEES 
is impressive considering it is just a hobby web site. The information in 
there is pretty shocking. Hell, I have always felt Best Buy was a shithole, 
but the information there is even worse than I imagined it.

There is really NO REASON to shop at Best Buy folks. If you want low prices, 
there are better places to get low prices and still get better service and 
quality (hell, ordering online is better). If you want good products, you 
definitely don't want to shop at Best Buy. They only stock low end stuff. If 
you want a nice tv or any other electronics you should go to a higher end 
store. For the SAME MONEY you get much better stuff and you get employees who 
know their stuff.

For appliances, Home Depot and Lowe's are both vastly superior.

For computers, http://www.alienware.com, Falcon Northwest, and even (gasp) 
Dell are vastly superior.
