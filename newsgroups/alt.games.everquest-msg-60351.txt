Hi,

Can someone please tell me a work-around that allows
non-administrators in Windows XP Prof. to play EverQuest?

When a Windows XP non-admin user tries to login to EverQuest, the
program shuts down after entering EQ user password and goes back to
the desktop.  I figure the non-admin's do not have necessary
permissions; so, I changed the EverQuest registry folder to allow all
users "Full Control", but still no luck. :-(  I also know that a
non-admin can run EverQuest using "Run As..." and also setting the EQ
shortcut to "Run with different credentials", but that prompts the
non-admin user for a administrator profile and password everytime and
I don't want to give out an admin password.

Thanks in advance!

Scott
