You are correct, not many chests have been opened near me.
Probbably 3/4 of the LDoN groups I have been in the party didnt
want to have anything to do with the chests as much as I
didnt.... as for the other 1/4....

Most people who want to open them are reasonable and will wait
until the addy is over to open them, when everyone else can clear
out and they are only risking themself. Generally the consensus
in the parties I have been in is that person can keep whatever
they get; be it a 2s gem or poison gas. ;)
