My 9 Bard took the port from the Nexus to Great Divide during a Ring War,
and spent an hour or two running around watching, before I got bored and
camped out.

Later, after the Ring War, I came back, ran through the tunnel in the
mountain that the river goes through, found the entrance to Velkator's (I've
been there before with other characters, but always following someone, so
wanted to figure out how to find it myself), then went into the Kodiak
caves.  Aggroed a bunch of them, but Selo's got me away, and I ran back to
Velkator's to clear aggro, but got confused where I was, so ran into another
Kodiak cave instead, and got killed.

I don't think Velious is as deadly to low level characters as most people
think, at least for those with some kind of running speed enhancement.
