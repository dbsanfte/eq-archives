Ovens are probably the best choice, because they have a portable version, so
are most likely to not be looked at, as opposed to forges (I know the ones
in freeport at least are usually camped) or barrels (the one in Rivervale is
usually occupied), NEVER have I found a oven in use, likewise, cultural
forges are probably a good choice (not dwarf, because its right next to the
2 normal forges)
