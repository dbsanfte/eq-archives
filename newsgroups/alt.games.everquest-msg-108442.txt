    Even if you assume 56 mobs, which is the upper end of what we'd pull,
that's still 100 DPS *on every mob there*. So you're looking at 3100 damage
on every mob that's pulled. That is a very good damage output for even a
wizard in an AoE group, and more than enough to justify his being there -
which was the point he was trying to make in the thread. He didn't even
mention all the other things he does which make him better than just another
wizard in the group.
