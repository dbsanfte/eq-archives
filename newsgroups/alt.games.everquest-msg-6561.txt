One explanation that was offered up in here is the following ..

EverQuest uses DirectX mainly. It has to keep many things in memory. When
you leave the game, it unloads them from memory. If you could alt-tab EQ, it
would have to unload that memory (for some reason) .. So when you wanted to
switch back, it would basically have to load all that information again,
which would be similar to going from the server screen to the game world.
