Looking at the numbers, I'm using the number of even con kills required
to solo to level (in a ZEM 75 zone) (I know that this is nonsense, but
it scales directly for groups / blue kills etc and it is the easiest to
calculate as a real mesure of the amount of effort to level)

Currently to fill 60 = 4321 kills
If all "Hell" is removed (with out moving the kills else where) = 2235
kills
If 54 and 59 are left in = 2788 kills

Here is a little table :

level     amount of hell
30        40
35        50
40        61
45        71
51        84
52        89
53        94
54       171
55       182
56       193
57       203
58       213
59       302
60       158

(This is the number of extra kills over the 37 - 40 required for most
levels)

So while 59 has the most effect I don't think that the other hells dont
have a significant effect. Basically they would nock about a 1/3 off the
required number of kills. I think that that is significant.
