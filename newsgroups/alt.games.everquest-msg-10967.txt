Enchanters aren't really damage dealers.  We do get some respectable nukes,
but they aren't very efficient, and our dot line won't stack with necro
dots.

What we do best is crowd control.

An enchanter can turn a 6 on 3 fight into three 6 on 1 fights.

True, with single pulls you aren't going to be able to do much but clarity,
tash, and slow (if there's no shaman), but on multiple-mob pulls, keeping an
eye on the mobs, and watching out for any additional ones that show up is
plenty exciting.

It's a different kind of mindset from the more traditional bash and nuke,
but it's worth making the transition.
