I find the same problem when playing my bard.  When soloing with numlock,
using the keyboard and a 3rd person view running in circles, I found I can
switch my hands (so I'm playing criscross) to give my twisting finger hand a
rest.  I also switch between using the keyboard to twist and the mouse to
give more variety and less stress on my hands.
