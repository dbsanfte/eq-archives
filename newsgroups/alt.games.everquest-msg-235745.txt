What kinda tore it for me, is that he asks that the children will bear
two grandchildren from a mate selected by him!

I can see that, now bear me some kids with your cousin here, she is
big and husky too, you can be the workers. This is Bonnie she scored
an 1500 on the SAT, mate with her please.

Smacks of eugenics, that I find offensive. The freedom to breed with
whomever you wish SHOULD be enshrined in the Constitution. In all
seriousness, Sanger advocated birth control not for all women, just
stupid women. Like I said, people have a basic human right to breed,
under normal circumstances.

People are free to be in a cult. They are also free to leave when they
wish. If both these statements are met, I don't see why he couldn't
populate a farm with good looking blonde women. I maight have to drift
by there when he gets old and worn out from his young nubile bride(s).

"Excuse me Ma'im, I'm a traveling salesman and my car broke down on
the road, can I sleep in the barn tonight?"
