Depends on what type of monk you have.
1.  If it's a human monk WK, and EK are ideal places to hunt for silk EK
averaging about 3 silks a kill on the spiders there.

2.  If it's a Iksar monk, FoB right out side CAB is great!!! You average
about 3 silks a kill on the bonebinders toward the north part of the zone.
Another advantage of this is while your waiting on spiders to spawn you can
whack skelies for bone chips and trade for silks.

Hope this helps.
