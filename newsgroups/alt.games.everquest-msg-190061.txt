Okay, I'm a noob and all but I've got to ask, what am I doing wrong here?
I've been playing for a few weeks now. I played a barbarian warrior for the
first couple of weeks and got to level 12. I didn't like the direction that
character was heading so I decided to start a barbarian (hey, I've got a
thing for kilts) beastlord. I've been playing this one for the last week and
I just hit level 7.

I always read about people raking in tons of platinum and leveling up rather
quickly, much quicker than I am. Am I doing something wrong?
