Its not considered rude to top post really. Its kind of a question of

short it would have made more sense for me to bottom post instead of
what I just did.

There are circumstances, such as the ones you state, where top posting
might make more sense such as where you are adding something new to a
couple people saying something which you are leaving in for context
but don't want people who already know what the thread is about to
have to scroll all the way down to see your new comment. 

Its really just very anal retentive to get all bent out of shape at a
person doing it either way.
