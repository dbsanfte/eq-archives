You'd be amazed at what you can accomplish with poor coding and/or poor
design.  I would tend to agree that they did implement it with two lists due
to similar things I have seen, but I certainly wouldn't place any wagers on
it.  The thing I was questioning is that DT seems to be quite certain that
this is how it was implemented.
