...I always thought social aggro chained...  Hm.  That's got to be useful 
somewhere.  How can we test it to be sure?  Of course, there's an 
intermediate case to make it more difficult.  What if, a mob can be 
social aggroed by a passing aggro mob within radius r, or a passing 
socially aggroed mob within radius r/2, or a passing socially^2 aggroed 
mob within r/4, etc?  Hmmm...  Where can we find some sets of 
evenly-spaced social mobs with different spacings...
