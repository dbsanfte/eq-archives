Depends on how you qualify it.

In certain zones, enchanter is the undisputed king.  In other zones,
necromancer is the undisputed king.

If you mean in any zone, at any level, with any level of equipment... 
magician is tops (though the gap at the lower end has narrowed due to
mudflation while magicians have gotten improvements at the higher end
widening the gap).  Rogue, necromancer, ranger, shaman, beastlord, wizard,
monk round out the list of sustained damage-dealers, in that order.

That all assumes balls-to-the-wall playing and a knowledge of how to squeeze
out every last bit of DPS you can.  They shift around a bit for the more
casual style players.
