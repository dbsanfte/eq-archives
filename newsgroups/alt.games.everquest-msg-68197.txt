LOL  No no!  That is MY household buying two puters just for EQ!  The fact
that the two of us ALSO have different interests and might just wanna be
surfing at the same time or whatever never entered into this.  Nor did the
fact that He's a writer and I'm a Freebies Geek...  Nope, it all has to do
with EQ...  LOL  C'mon Philippe, admit that your household is just like mine
and that's why you are getting a second puter...

;o)

hehe

What are you getting by way of machines btw?  Or did you already have two
appropriately equipped machines?
