It only took ten minutes; I was in and out of the operating room very
quickly.

There are always risks.  The disclaimer Monual signed in the story is not
far different from the disclaimer I had to sign; basically I gave them
permission to blind me for life.  As long as you take the antibiotics and
the like, you should be just fine.

As to whether it's worth it... well, my eyesight with glasses was 20/15;
now, without glasses, it's 20/25.  It's still early in the healing process
and they tell me that it will get better over time.  For me the biggest
adjustment is the fact that I now have trouble reading; I have to hold a
book at a very specific distance in order to read it.  They warned me
beforehand that I would likely need reading glasses still, but it's a big
psychological adjustment for me.  Before, while I couldn't even read the big
"E" on the top of the chart, I could read the tiniest of print just fine.
Now I can't read at all if the light is dim; I have to get used to that.

It's an adjustment.  Personally, it's nice not having to worry about rain
smearing my glasses or my glasses fogging up when I walk inside or my
glasses breaking or etc, etc.  Plus I happen to think I look better without
my glasses.  I just have to balance all that against slightly worse vision
and the need for reading glasses.

I can use the computer just fine, though, so EQ is no problem for me.  =)
