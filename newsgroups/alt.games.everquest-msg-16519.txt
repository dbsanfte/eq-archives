no desire to play...the fall of AW has pretty much put me off flight/warsims

i'm enjoying EQ again after taking a couple weeks off...i saw WWIIOnline
firsthand at E3 and was not impressed...it's summer now...I plan on going
outside more here in sunny southern california instead of staring at a
computer monitor all night...

got my first taste of my reclaimed social life last night...i had forgotten
how much fun REAL people can be...especially 5 cute ones that take you to a
Karaoke bar and sing to you all night...
