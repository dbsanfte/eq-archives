I beg to differ.  As a committed casual player since July of '99
(well, ok I did let my subscriptions lapse for a few months this
spring/summer, even made a farewell post here), I can tell you
that meaningful equipmant upgrades have been available since
before Kunark.  It has nothing to do with the Bazaar.  And LDoN
adds only a small (but significant) bit of upgrading for true
casuals, it's really much more to the benefit of power gamers
(be they raiders or not), and is completely neutral to guild
status.  And, as it has been since early-/mid-Kunark, if you're
not part of a raiding organization (usually a guild, sometimes
an alliance or an open org) you don't have any access to the
best loots, nor do you have more than token access to the second
or third best loots.

As for Ben's way overboard whining about the destruction of EQ
by casual gamers, that is likewise total bullshit.  It's the
power-gamers and raid-guilders who got the game CHANGED from
what it was to begin with.  And it's the twitch game kiddie-
arcade types who've been driving changes more recently.  It's
extremeely hypocritical to be whining about casual players
trying to get SOE to once again give them a place in the game
that used to be all about casual play for the overwhelming
majority of the player base.  And let us not overlook that SOE
themselves have admitted (during the uber-summit) that over
half of their player base is level 30-50.
