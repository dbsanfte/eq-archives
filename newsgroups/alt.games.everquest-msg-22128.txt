Apparently not. People have been doing this for ages and guides have
actually commented that it *isn't* an exploit, rather it is using your
class' abilities to  speed things up. Of course, guides have never been
known to disagree with each other :)

It's no more an exploit though than say training a mob to near another
mob that hates it then watching the two of them slug it out before you
kill both of them for twice the xp.
