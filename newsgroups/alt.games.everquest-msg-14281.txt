total AC is the only thing that matters.

no, mobs don't need magic weapons to hit magic armor.  as far as i know,
the only specific benefit of magic armor is:

if your shield is magical, you can bash will-o-wisps (or any other
monster that can only be hit by magical weapons)

same with shoulders & slam

same with boots & kicking (gotta be a monk though)

same with gloves & punching (monk here too)
