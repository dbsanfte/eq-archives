I have been playing EQ for over a year. With some of my RL friends we
formed a guild on MT server last year. But most of them now have
switched to DAoC and since than I have been playing with different
ppl. I love this game more than others (DAoC etc.) and spend most of
my spear time playing it, yet cant spent more than 4 hours a weekday
and lets say 8 hours weekends. On the other hand I have a RL to keep
up (work, girlfriend, RL friends, etc).

One thing I have learned in this game is that if you wanna go higher
lvls, visit some zones such as plains, loot uber items, get rich... u
have to be a part of a decent guild. That idea leads me to find a
guild probably not an uber one but one that is flexible and mature for
ppl like me. I am on MT server and dont know too much about other
guilds and their objective in the game. Honestly I dont wanna be a
part of a guild and later I find out the way they look at things are
completely different from mine and vice versa. What would be the best
way and strategy to find the right the guild(s) and be a part of it?
I might also consider giving up my lvl 35 SK and lvl 36 shammy and
change server.

Thanks in advance.
