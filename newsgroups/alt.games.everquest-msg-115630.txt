Thank goodness I'll never have to raid with an inconsiderate,
brainless twit of your caliber.

(Hint: If 3 groups mow down some greenies and the occasional blue,
walk out of Perma and go on their way by foot for a zone or two, it's
a minor inconvenience. If a druid has to bind in a potentially nasty
spot, port out a steadily diminishing number of people, and then wait
to port up to the moon before crossing several zones to get his old
bind point back, it's not only a major inconvenience for him: he runs
the risk of being stuck in a death loop at bind point, and the last
group to be ported out might be hit by something they can't handle. 

Oh, and I was once killed in the deepest butt end of the Hole by a
revenant that popped as a pickup raid ended, while I was sitting to
mem circles for people who wanted ports every which way. I was rezed
10 seconds before the last cleric was ported out, and me and the last
5 melees were counting the seconds till I got enough mana to get us
all out of what would be a very fun nightly CR.)
