Give 2 Gp to Centaur Jarves (?) in South Karanas. Go to North Karanas and
give Gp to Innkeeper James (?). Before Nerf you would get 1-3pp and enough
GP to give back to Jarves, and a decent Faction boost. AND what was most
important to most ppl was the one blue of exp you'd get for each run. I was
told of this quest by a level 24 was getting 1 blue per run, and at level
15/16 I got one blue per run *Shrug* (i wanted level 16 so I could get
breeze... what can I say? *laugh*). After recent patch I've heard you get
virtually no exp from it. Think you still get faction and pp tho (I think
faction is all Queynos but I'm probably wrong)
