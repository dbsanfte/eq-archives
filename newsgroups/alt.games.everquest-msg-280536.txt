But what kind of cooling system did he use?  Fans at room temp
(amateur),  duct to AC unit (average OCer). water-cooled (expert), or
phase change (extreme OCer) :)

My PC is water cooled and for radiator I'm using an automotive heater
core from a '77 Mercury as it's big enough to handle a pair of 120mm
fans.  The reservoir is made from a tupperware container.
