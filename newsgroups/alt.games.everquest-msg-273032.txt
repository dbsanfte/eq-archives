Man, this thread brings to my mind why the sport of bear baiting was
popular in Elizabethan England.

  Any ways, that's neither here nor there.  Quick question, D.J.  If I
understand right, this whole tangent this thread has taken took life
when you made the statement that SOE employees ought to go to jail
(paraphrasing here, but I think that was the general idea).  When others
pointed out that no law had been broken, you countered that some people
go to jail without having broken any laws.  Did I get that right so far?

  In the above that I have quoted, you seem to be saying that civil
rights are a good thing. Fair enough.  Lots of people, including myself,
agree with that sentiment.  But if that is so, are you saying that SOE
employees, by the nature of service they provide through the product
they vend, ought to have less protection of civil rights than you do? 
In other words, (I tend to sometimes write confusingly.  A known flaw on
my part) are you saying that while civil rights are good, you still
favor the jailing of the SOE employees despite their not having
committed any crimes (or at least not ones that we are discussing here
in the "send them to jail" thread)?  Do the devs still go to jail if you
are the one in charge of everything?
