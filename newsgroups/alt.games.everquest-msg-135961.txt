Yes, it does.

In addition people get very sidetracked by the whole sex thing.
Anyone- gay, bi, straight, or asexual- in a long term relationship
knows that sex is not all there is to a relationship.  For some
reason, though, as soon as that relationship is between two men- in
other words "gay", people assume that being gay is all about sex,
hence a behaviour, hence something that should be "hidden away in
private".   All very good rationalisations for those who are trying to
hide homophobia, but this whole house of cards breaks down pretty
quickly if you take sex out of the picture.  I'd still be gay if I
never had sex with my life-partner (and after ten years it doesn't
happen as often as it used to!) but the relationship overall would not
change to an outsider's perspective.
