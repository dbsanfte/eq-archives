Yes, you can get by with only one key.

The first key is a tallow marked chandle, which drops off the feasters that
sometimes spawn in the entranceway. (the floating sperms with teeth)
Alternatley, you can jump off the first platform and kill in the basement,
you're sure to have at least once feaster type down there.

The keys are a maze.  In order to "do" HS by the keys... you need to get the
candle from an entrance mob, then move into north wing.   In north wing, in
the center room, is a purple looking amulet on the ground.   Pick this up, it
is the key to the boss room at the end of the north wing.

Then you must camp and kill the boss of north wing.   Once the named spawns,
he will drop the key to the entrance of west wing.   A calendar, I believe
(looks like a medallion).   Once inside west wing, you must find a ground
spawn in the room at the end of the hall.   That is the key to the back part
of west wing.   Then you get to the last room and you must camp the boss of
west wing (Skeletal Procurer).   100% of the time, he drops (along with
whatever loot he has) a "broken dagger"... one charge of Dead Man Floating, No
Rent.   This is the key to south wing entrance.

Thats as far as I have gotten with the keys so far, but you see the way it's
going, right?    Save yourself a huge amount of trouble and bring a rogue.

All of them are no rent.

Bring an evacer.   Howling Stones has only two exits, one at the end of South
Wing, and one at the end of East Wing.  (Deposits you at the entrance to the
temple in OT).  The teleporters at the end of North and West wings just take
you back to the entrance, still inside Charsis.

Most of HS is one way.   Once you are past the paintings, you will drop down
and be unable to return the way you came.   You can drop down through whatever
pit is within reach and make it to the teleporter to entrance that way, but
thats it.    At the end of North and West Wings are teleporters to the
entrance.  Not outside.

Back to the zone in.  And yes, there are a lot of roamers and statics both in
the basement (one time I even saw a named down there.)

> I know..... too many questions. Shut up stupid troll. ;-)

If you do attempt to do the zone without a rogue, good luck to you.  It's a
real hastle involving a lot of camping, that has to be repeated on each trip.
You can save the keys by dueling or dying, and leaving them on your corpse
(tucked out of the way, please) and returning for them before they can rot.

Have fun with it... it's one of the very best dungeons in the game.   The
experience flows like water, and theres almost never anyone else there to
bother you.   Howling Stones is the way a dungeon should be done...  you don't
stake out your camp and pull what you can, you crawl through the zone,
tracking whatever names are up and erradicating them.

Chardok is the only other dungeon that comes close... Better loot, but more
crowded.  You can do the same thing though for the most part.

Home is where the Stones Howl.
