Heh... have you seriously never had code that ran fine with the debugger 
on, but broke when you turned the debugger off? Or attached a debugger 
to a process that wouldn't run with the debugger attached?

Once the debugger is attached it becomes part of the mini-verse. But 
attaching it *does* affect it.

Within the confines of your mini-verse you are both omnipotent and 
omniscient (you have complete access to the state, and logic, etc)... 
its also worth pointing out your programs don't have free will.

If you haven't read it, you probably would enjoy "Permutation City" 
(Greg Egan) if you can find a copy. Its proposes a number of interesting 
thought experiments within the subject of computer universes.

Hmmm... looks like my Hardcover has really appreciated... its running in 
the multiple hundreds now...that's always nice to see. :)
