The problem with the hunting guides, as I see it, is they don't tend to give
any idea who "groupable" a place is.

Highkeep is an example, I could wander into Warrior room for better
experience, loot, etc.  However you need a good group for that as a cleric;
if you are in on of those groups that thinks a cleric calling OOM means
"bring them on", then you are dead.

There is no way I would want to solo as a cleric in Highkeep; anything I do
solo is going to be boring.  However it requires a fairly good group.   Bad
grouping gets me killed there, or at least running for the guards a lot.

Thanks
