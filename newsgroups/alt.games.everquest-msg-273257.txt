 'Twas good while it lasted. We reached toward the heavens,
and strode the land valiantly, an example to all who saw.
We had a good run, reaching for the Elemental Planes and Time
itself. But, alas, it shall not be.
  EQ2 and WoW took their toll, of course, as they did on everyone.
Where we had just begun to field 40 people per raid, now we had
trouble mustering 20. More devestating, however, was Naelau,
our primary source of energy, going in for surgery; some sprts-related
injury, I gather. Without him, recruiting slowed down, and we lost
a good raid leader. He has only returned briefly so far.
  The Christmas season also took its toll, as people has more
pressing RL matters to attend to: shopping, family gatherings. But
after the first of the year, they started coming back, and our raid
numbers started inching up. We started making alliances, doing
joint raids. A program was announced to get us into the Elemental
Planes in 90 days.
  But, as well, there were troubling signs, also: people leaving for other
guilds, usually unnanounced. People drifting away, even some who
had been big names, core members, at one time. Still, it seemed we
could go on with the people we still had.
  And then it all fell apart.
  It happened Monday night. A Manaetic Behemoth raid. Our usual
planar flagging raid leader was in charge; he knew the MB fight well,
had even led us through with no deaths at all before. This time,
however, one of our other officers, our Epics Officer, did something
blatantly against orders. He got booted. Which set off a cascade
reaction: other poeple started leaving, the planar flagging raid leader
left., more left thinking the guild was finished. By the time I logged
on late that night, most of my closest friends in the guild were gone.
  It is admirable to say you will not leave your friends. But what do
you do when THEY leave YOU? Nothing personal, of course, nothing
to do with YOU; they just can't work with each other anymore.
  A guild is like an online family. Divorces are all too common.
  The Council is still officially in business; our current leader still
entertains notions of being oriented toward the high-end game.
Realistically, however, we are now a small family guild, or perhaps
a feeder guild. We can develop lower level characters into the upper
levels, but we can't get them flagged for more exclusive content.
We can't help with key epic fights. It's a different guild than the one
I joined. The people who made it what it was are gone, many to places
I can't follow - prime time raiding guilds like Malus Imperium, Crusaders
Valorous, and Eternal Sovereign. Guilds that farm Time and can get
them through MPG trials easily.
  I will try to stay in touch with them. I will offer myself as a guest on
raids, when allowed. I can always work on my alts. But with the
Council, I don't know that it has a future; for a long time we were
THE magnet for quality people, and now that they're gone, there's no
one like them left to recruit.
  Just taking it now one day at a time...
