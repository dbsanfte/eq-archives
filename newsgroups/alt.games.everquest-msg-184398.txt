Duh. Seab is not really a friend after all, is he?

Not surprising. The items were worth enough to Seab
to lose the friend, so why would he answer?

But not very wise.

Nope, I've always relied on drop or tradeskill device transfers. 
In four years I have lost one item doing that, so I'm already ahead of
your friend. In case you don't know, items in zone tradeskill things
(forge, etc) remain in game for much longer than dropped things. If
you get both players to an unused area with an oven or forge or junk,
its pretty safe.

Lots of people will swipe stuff if the item is worth more to them than
the repercussions.

A few thousand other people before your friend. If he was
around EQ boards much he would not have done that.
Nothing can be done about it.

move on.
