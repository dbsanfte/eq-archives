Cool, you ran a game store? I never had the guts to do anything on that
scale.
I agree about ignoring the fiddly bits. Spend all night just trying to
decide if that arrow hit the orc in the eye or nose. That's why
computers are so great to RPG's, they can deal with all the fiddly bits
for us now. No substitute for a GM, but a fantastic tool for the GM.

Got ya this time.

Yes, it was a kludgy system that never made much sense, yet allowed for
turn-based games to cover more time than they otherwise would. More
farther down...

I liked the big maps. And hexes. Admittedly, I have always been more of
a FASA and GURPS player than D&D or D20, so I was very familiar with
and fond of the hex grid over the square grid. Made more sense
geometrically, too.

Actually, now that I think on it, Battletech and Aerotech had the same
problem. Aerotech hexes represented kilometers, planet-sized areas or
more, and a turn represented time pasing on the scale of hours or
minutes depending on whether you were playing in an atmospheric map or
space map, while Batletech hexes represented meter-sized areas and time
passing on the scale of minutes. Even though it was supposedly designed
so you could play both games concurrently, the discrepancies in time
elapsed per turn made for some serious headaches. This could be
seriously compounded if you were also using the system as part of a
Mechwarrior campaign. This may partially explain the scrapping of
Battletech 3025 MMO. You make an excellent point.

I get your point this time. But again, that really doesn't translate
well to a multiplayer CRPG. Which may be what we're both getting at; EQ
is based on a fundamentally single-group game with single-group RPG
logic and rules applied poorly to what ammounts to a world simulator.

And this is where EQ's heavy reliance on D&D bit them in the ass. They
would have been better off selecting a set scale for all zones.
Actually, they would have been better off never having zones in the
first place, but qudrants, where adjacent quadrants load in the
background ready for players to move into, reducing load and wait
times. I know they were working in the confines of 1997-1999 computing
power, when it was really exploding, but there were still ways around
it. Smaler quadrants for early game content, then have larger and
larger quadrants as the game expanded. If they had done it right, it
could potentially even have been trivial to go back later and merge
some of the smaller quadrants into larger quadrants, even swap out
low-poly count quadrants with higher poly-count quadrants that still
fit in with the original layout instead of their current way of
completely revamping entire zones in ways that make them completely
different and unfamiliar to long time players with little to no
explanation why the sudden change in geography. (What? No, that... that
river of lava was always there, you just never, um, noticed.). Still
boggles my mind they kept with the flawed zone model in EQ2.

I kinda diverged heavily there, but I would just like to point to the
Karanas as evidence they had the capacity to do quadrants back then.
Pretty hefty-sized zones that could have been broken down into more
Commons-sized areas that loaded in the background as quadrant borders
were approached, giving a more fluid feel to movement across the
landscape.

So, yeah, time dialation. It ends up being faster to go, say, through
Cabilis to go from Warsliks to FoB than to actually walk from Warsliks
to FoB, because of the discrepancies in scale between the indoor and
outdoor zones.

Was it yards for the outdoor maps? My mistake. Then yes, a 10x10 YARD
square could easily fit a 300x300 FOOT structure. Still, Kurns tower
does not fit inside the tower model in FoB.

And as you mentioned, this causes some serious movement and time
issues. It could have been marginally dealt with had they specified
different movement rules for indoor zones over outdoor zones, but
really they should have just stuck with one scale. I always assumed
they had, because I do :)

Again, I think we're in complete agreement. I simply misunderstood the
first go around.
