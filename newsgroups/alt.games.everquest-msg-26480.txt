Actually, my little high elf cleric was almost head to toe in Bronze from
level 14 or so on ....

(I likely took a route less travelled in that I went to WC after I got level
9 and my magic hammer and hunted wisps for GLS then used the proceeds to buy
bronze for 1 to 1.5pp for AC).

You can buy jagged bands (2 for 100pp?) and orc fang earrings (maybe 2 for
60 pp?) to help out on the +str side to allow wearing all of this possible.
My theory was the same as what some others here have - rather have a ton of
AC  when I might be jumped in my teens then run around with a 160 or 180
wisdom but be like a caster.  Getting hounded by yard trash in Unrest or in
a RR group helped me out in this regard I think.

Now that I am in my 20's and really cant solo that much, or am in areas
where groups are always in need of a cleric, I have started to trade off
some AC for +wis items - a BS Tunic being the classic example.  Without
being in a guild and basically saving for everything I have to buy (or kill
for), I do not have the luxury of a few thousand pp lying around so it will
likely take me well into my 30's before I get a nicely rounded character
with a good balance between AC and WIS/mana.

You may also want to see the chain I started a few weeks back "+ wis items
for clerics" which might be of value to you in your teens .... got some
really good advice from people in that one.
