I agree.  One thing that isn't mentioned is that all the old gear
appear to only have on augment slot in them (I never had anything
with more than 1).  LDoN gear can have several.  If you get a top
LDoN weap and put 3 top LDoN augments in it, now how close does it
come to PoT, or at least elemental.
