some guildmates and I were working on our access quest for chamber of 
immortallity other night and a group ran in just as we killed the named, 
Thimzem Ci'Re, and started cussing us saying they had spawned him. How do 
you spawn the three nameds for that quest? Or were they just full of 
bullshit?
