Apparently you don't understand the word "meaning" when it is used to 
describe "signifance".

And Olympic Gold medals should be awarded to the worlds top recognized 
athletes, and anyone who has $50.00, is that right?

You seriously think an olympic athlete is not going to feel their 
efforts cheapened by the sale of authentic gold medals through the IOC 
gift shop.

The problem with farming is that its possible. You have static spawn 
points that randomly drop item X after enough repititions. You want to 
eliminate farming, change the loot model to triggered drops, or 
instanced encounters, or any of a dozen other solutions.
