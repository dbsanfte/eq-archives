Your character information is all stored on the EQ servers, not on your
machine.
All that you have lost is your option and client settings.  This means that
you can reinstall (and go thru all the patching nightmare we are all going thru
now,
plus all accumulated patches to bring your old discs up to speed) and use your
account name and password just like before.

What you will find is that all your socials and and hotkeys, as well as any
window settings you may have organized if you use the f10 view, and
little things like setting the game to always start with you in Run instead
of walk and moving your attack key away from the letter A, have all been
wiped. back to default.
