The bag can be obtained at any time from any of the quest giver mobs. 
In fact when I did my final combine Jeb was refusing to give out bags
at all so I used one from the gems girl in FV.

The critical thing is the coin (Jebs Seal).

There is an excellent walkthrough for the whole quest available, plus
there are lots of useful tips too at www.therunes.net
