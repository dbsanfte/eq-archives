Nah, that doesn't work.  MOST of the really inane names out there were
created by people who will get instantly defensive if you point out their
name is against the rules.  Why go through the hassle?   The only time I
send a tell to someone regarding their name is when they're under level 10
and they've misspelled it (after that I don't bother anymore as THEY get
defensive too!).

"You know, Mr. Bank Robber, that waving that gun around is against the
rules." <g>

Oh, I've never petitioned so many names as I have in Paineel when I was
PLing my wizard taxi.  Sooooo many names based on rap singe...errr,
artis....errr, rappers.  Hey, they're not African American, they're
Erudites...if you can't come up with an Erudish name, create a human.
