On most of my characters, I roleplay a good guy, and under most
circumstances, I refuse to attack any 'intelligent' creature who cons
indifferent to me.  This includes Cutthroat Dervishes, certain groups of
Goblins (depending on faction), and formerly the Kobolds of the Toxx (before
they were changed from indifferent to automatic KOS.)

It started out when one of my very first characters was a Cleric of the
Prime Healer, and I found that the Qeynos rogues guild (circle of unseen
hands) conned indifferent to me.... figured from that that I must be a
healer who is a good guy, but won't refuse help to anyone not openly hostile
to me...even if they're a little bit shaddy.

I figure there's enough hostile beasties in Norrath...don't need to make
even more things hate me.

Sometimes I lose out on xp, quests, and some groups because of this.  Big
deal.  Other things in the game mean more to me than leveling at all costs.
I am usually a bit nitpicky over skills and faction anyway...just happens to
be the way I prefer to play.
