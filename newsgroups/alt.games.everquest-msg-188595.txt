I ignore the price cutters.  I just set my spider silks for 5pp and wait.
There was one guy selling for 2pp.  I almost went to buy his stock, but
decided to be lazy.

I haven't really figured out the going price for spiderling silk, and I'm
not real sure I want to get into making padding, because that means hunting
pelts, and at level 13, that's just more stuff that doesn't also give
experience.  I don't really hunt spiders.  I just kill all the one's I come
across as I hunt things that give experience.

Cheers,
Eric
