The idea isn't to have some stuff when you get back to your body...
after all, all your normal gear is there.  Its to hold onto stuff by
leaving it unlooted on bodies.

The person described here was apparantly using it to avoid
encumberance (or just plain running out of space: since the stuff on
your body doesn't count as being on you, you can have hundreds of
pounds of loot sitting there, and won't ever run out of carrying
space.  Loot it later at your leisure.

Another common use for this is to hold LORE tagged items, which are
one to a character.  With some work, you can put one on each of your 8
characters on a server, plus one in the bank.. but its annoying and
requires a trip to the bank each time.  Leave the lore item on a body
though and you could have hundreds, with no bank run needed (if you
are a caster, you can even bind right next to the pile of bodies)

But the most important use of this is to preserve NO RENT items, which
will otherwise decay if you log out for more than a few minutes.  Get
a bunch of high level mage summoned gear that boosts your capability,
and its good for the run of your play session, but not there when you
log back in... unless you arrange to die before you log and leave the
summoned items on your body.  Log back in, loot up, and you're good to
go again.

This sort of thing is even more important when it comes to the few
items in the game which are dropped off mobs but are NO RENT; most
famously the rapier which drops off shadowed men and is needed to do
the JBoots quest: kill a dozen or two shadowed men to get one to drop,
then make your way to RM and find Haster not up... helps a lot if you
just manage to die and leave the body for next time.  Better, since
you can drag your body, back when you needed to carry Haster's cash in
gold, it was often impossible to catch the little bugger with all that
on you.  Die, leave rapier and cash on body, catch up with him, then
loot and do your hand in, much simpler.

There are also some keys that work this way, and in some cases keys
for Raid level targets where you need the key to allow 30 people to go
have fun; leaving it on your body means its possible to do the key
gathering today, and schedule the raid for 8pm tomorrow without
worrying about whether you will manage to get the key again tomorrow.

Most of these plans, though, don't call for leaving 30 bodies lying
around.

Oh, the Mage Epic summons an item which is used to summon the epic
pet.  Used to see mage bodies at the entrances to -lots- of high level
zones, because that item represents a lot of sitting on your butt
waiting to recover mana, so mages would die and leave it there rather
than log out and let it fade.  Better, for raid purposes, this would
mean they could summon item, use it to summon pet, summon second item,
hold it for when pet dies, and then loot body so as to have item to
summon yet a third pet at no mana cost (during the fight that is)
which allows a near Zerg tactic for taking down really hard targets,
in fact you could set up as many bodies this way as you'd need for a
given fight.  Never having (or tried for) the mage epic, I don't know
if that was changed recently when they did some tinkering with the
epic for LDoN purposes.
