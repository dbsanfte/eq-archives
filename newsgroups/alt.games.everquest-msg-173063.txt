Its really difficult to say...Ive always viewed the first 10 levels as
merely something to spend time getting used to the character - at a
mechanical level. In that time hybrids go from pure combat to having
spells as well, casters get several levels and the concept of chains
appears, and the tanks develop their additional skills.

Its always been something I choose to do solo, simply as that allows my
weapon skills and casting skills to build up to a level where they are
sensible for use in the second 10 levels of life, things like bind wounds,
sense heading, offense defence etc. As such it doesnt really bother me if
the area is quiet....in fact it means I get more chance at the mobs to
gain xp. You dont need people nearby to res or to corpse find for you at
this stage. I guess if you have problems then yes you could do with some
advice. Level 3 really is very limited but....

As to your specific choice, I'd suggest you try a couple of
levels of different characters - the first 5 levels are difficult to
seperate closely related classes and race issues but it'll give some feel 
of the broad spectrum of whats about....look at a warrior or hybrid class,
a wis caster of some kind and a non casting class for a level or
two....this should take anything from half an hour if you dont like the
class to oh 3-4 levels (say 2 hours in a good newbie yard). Say 5-6 hours.

Vary the races and start places and you can get a look at the different
newbie yards, how populated they are when you play etc as well as an idea
if erudite wiz is for you (as an int caster it fits nicely).

Odus is a quiet place, you might if you feel up to the risk run to the
Paineel newbie yard which is usually populated - people coming thru to the
Warrens and Stonebrunt plus a lot of necros levelling up. That also takes
you closer to the Spires of Odus and out to Luclin and the rest of the
world...

Im surprised you say Qeynos was empty as the yard just outside the gate is
usually pretty ful (did you stay in South Qeynos?) and Qeynos Hills next
door is real busy most of the time.

Other than that you could start another Wizard or move yours to Freeport,
whgich is really central and very busy, or to Akanon which is a nice
newbie yard. You could go to HighElf land and Gfay for starting but its
NOT my choice of a good place to start...
