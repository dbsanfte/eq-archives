Do they have to be installed in a specific order, like the order
they're released in, or can you just install them any which way. I
only ask because the other game I play which has expansion packs is
The Sims, and with that it is a good idea to install them in the order
they were released in, and even uninstall later versions if you get
hold of an earlier expansion
