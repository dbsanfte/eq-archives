Unless you have sow potions or unless you make friends with the lizards then
LIO is a tough place for non-lizard evil races.

Yes, there's a place in FM to bind.  I don't know where it is, but I'm
guessing that it's probably where you want bound...either there or right
inside Cabilis (assuming SKs get an invis spell).  Closest safe bank and
merchant is way the hell over in OT and the run through FM can be harrowing,
depending on your level (but if you're hunting in LIO it probably means
you're no higher than level 30).

I HEAR that OT has some good hunting for many levels...you might try that.
