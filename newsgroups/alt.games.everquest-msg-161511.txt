also the decesion that the florida supreme court was trying to swing the
election to democrats and doing so in a manner that contrevened the law was
9-0 .

The remedy of telling them to just shut the hell up now was 7-2.

The official count and the recount mandated by law with an election that
close where both done with computers. Both resulted in bush winning . What
went on after that was a comedy like no other. The common preception that
democrats tried to steal the election is in large part because they did. The
only reason that anyone thinks diffrent is that the group of people known as
television reporters vote democratic 94% of the time. This is slightly
larger a voting turnout than the group of people included in  the democratic
party  ( which vote democratic 90% of the time)
