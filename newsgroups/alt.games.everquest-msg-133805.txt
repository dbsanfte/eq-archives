I've seen this go either way.  My conclusion is that the comparison
being done is based on level right down to your fractional level,
so that 20 may have been really 20.5, while you were perhaps 30.1.
20.5 would be good to exp up to 30.75.  Hmm, this isn't working
out like I thought.

20.9 could group up to 31.35, thats better... but less likely than
the 20.5 figure, which half the 20's out there would excede.
