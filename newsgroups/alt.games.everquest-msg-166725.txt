Hmm, what about those of us who have a preference for japanese (not "chop
suey" asian flick stuff, but real, honest-to-Tunare, hitting myself with the
New Nelson's Kanji Dictionary japanese)?  Just becasue some script kiddies
watch Dragonball, and think it's kewl, doesn't mean everyone is like that.
Anyways, if they had half a brain, they'd toss DBZ away in favor of Ah,
Megamisama or Kare Kano.

Be proud of your horizontal emoticons, if you stretch the smile big enough,
it almost looks like a Totoro is making it.
