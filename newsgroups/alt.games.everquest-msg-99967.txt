As a follow-up. I do feel foolish, as a cleric, for not having gated
out of there on the first two bad pulls. Three bad pulls was too much
for me to handle. Also, I understand bad pulls happen. Its part of the
game. And I realize that there are bad groups and good groups, and
that I will be part of both from time to time. On a good note, I have
learned something from this ... I've learned how to better recognize a
potentially dangerous situation. Hopefully, next time, I'll have the
common sense to leave a group like that prior to being kicked out (and
hopefully before dying a couple of times).

Like the gambler says 'You have know when to hold em and know when to
fold em'. Again, thanks for your replies.
