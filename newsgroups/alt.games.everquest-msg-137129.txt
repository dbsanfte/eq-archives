    It allows for player to be brought back into a fight for zero mana cost.
This allows for tactics like the zerg rush - just keep chain-ressing the
dead back in and wear the target down. You could not do that without the
cleric epic.

    It would allow guilds that could not win a fight with a target to zerg
it to death. They aren't pretty wins, but you still get the loot.

    Don't get me wrong - I think the bottleneck is BS, too. But I understand
why Verant feels it has to be there. Cleric epics change how people raid,
and speed a guild's progression through mobs.
