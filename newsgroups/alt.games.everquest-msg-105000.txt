As a member of the Lucky Cabbage Cult I'd love it if protection of
cabbage were a usable spell. Dots, well, it would be nice to be less
embarrased by shamans :) The snare effect on the epic makes keeping a
mob snared less predictable so I wouldn't mind losing *that* but I
guess they figured it needs the Druid Thing(tm) in the effect and I'll
just take extra care when I use it after I get it (hopefully Thursday)
- casting it on runners that get to running health just as the effect
wears off = not good.
And as for healing, we did get significant upgrades to that a while
back, so while I wouldn't mind if the level 60 heal was more efficient
than the level 55 heal, I don't really think it's that big an issue.

I am dead set against ever having Luclin ports for druids. I deal in
earth magic, not moon magic and not the bookish hocuspocus those
wizards play with. They can keep their fancy spires as far as I am
concerned.
