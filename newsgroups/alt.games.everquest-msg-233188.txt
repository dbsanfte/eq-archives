Wasn't it Bill Gates who said that no one should ever need more than
64k of memory? And now, his most recent OS requires at least 256 MEGS
to run properly.

I remember when a 14.4 dial-up modem was blazing fast...

I remember working on a TRS-80 in school...and when David Lighthorn
(?) almost destroyed the world with one. (War Games. ;) )

Computers make one feel old fast. Computer games even faster. About 3
years ago, I bought Quake 2 off the markdown rack at EB. The clerk
took a look at it and immediately said "Ah! A classic!".

"If Quake 2 is 'classic', what does that make Quake 1?" I asked

"Ancient."

I didn't dare ask about Doom. :(
