Well, I'm on a single account, so there won't be any running around on 
autofollow.

But I'm also not trying to locate a mob, I'm trying to spawn one; track 
isn't so much to see where he is, as to see if he's up at all.

I'm looking primarily at Tox Forest, where I have to spawn a Reeking 
Skunk; there are three other similar "kill random stuff till you spawn 
the rare somewhere in the zone" quest parts I need for this phase of my 
epic, but I filed the epic quest thing away somewhere and can't be 
bothered to look it up, so I'm not sure what level my tracker will need 
to be to kill things there.  If its similar to Tox, then I'm good to go 
with this guy, if its harder zones I'll have to go to plan B) hire a 
real tracker.

Anyway, what I want this guy to be able to do is kill newbie mobs in 
droves while checking to see if my target has popped.  Once he does, 
I'll switch to my main and see if I can grab a friend or two from my 
list or my guild, and go find and kill the thing.  Thus far I've yet to 
see anyone over level 3 in the Tox, so I'm not very afraid my spawn will 
get stolen while I arrange things.  I suppose if he's really hard to 
find I can get my throwaway ranger back on and track him down, get 
partners in sight and let them keep an eye on him.

Aye but I did feel silly doing it fully intending to scrap the 
character... you never know, though, I might end up needing a 30 ranger 
for similar purposes later, and heck, it only took 10 extra minutes out 
of my day.
