Well I killfile people rarely but if it pushes your buttons enough do
it .. both BIzbee and DarkTyger have killfield me no loss at all from
my point of view.  That was my point .. this NG is the only one that I
visit that verbally abuses people for top posting .. I repeat the only
one. A solution for those that get on their high horses about this is
to killfile people, makes sense really.

Two threads ... the first started here:
http://tinyurl.com/28f5x

that was what I was referring to and the start of all this nonsense,

The second was the "bottom poster getting caned thread" which when I
posted it quite clearly illustrated my point that the NG in question
was a top posting group and were in fact attacking a bottom poster.

Sarcasm does not become you.

Of course it makes the group a top posting group .. the majority of
posts seen by people are top posts.  Occasionally I visit other groups
for interest, if I saw 60% of the posts are top posts I would think
this was a top posting group.  But in the end you have fallen for the
three card Sisson, Bizbee, DarkTyger trick where you believe the
posting was about whether my list of NGs was top or bottom posting.  It
wasn't, and is shown quite clearly in the url I gave above.  It was
about the question ... why is this the only newsgroup I inhabit that
roundly abuses top posters.

People can post all they want about whether the groups are top posting
or not (it is spurious) .. the simple fact remains that no one in those
groups verbally abuses posters for top posting.  In fact, I have not
seen verbal abuse in any of those groups unlike this one thanks to
Sisson, Bizbee and DarkTyger.

A defence of top posters is to suggest that people killfile or ignore
them .. are you serious?
