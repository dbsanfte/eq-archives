You can do some basic checks by pinging and tracing the route to that
server.  EQ server X can be reached at X.everquest.com.  E.g., you can
try "ping erollisimarr.everquest.com" and "tracert
erollisimarr.everquest.com" (assuming Windows..."traceroute" if Unix).

Note: you have to spell the server name correctly for this to work.
One "s", not two.

If ping and traceroute show that you've got connectivity to the server
and do not have excessive packet loss, then you know something is
probably wrong with the server.  If you are losing a lot of packets,
or can't ping it at all, then traceroute can show where the problem
lies (e.g., at Verant, or at someplace between your end and Verant, or
at your end).
