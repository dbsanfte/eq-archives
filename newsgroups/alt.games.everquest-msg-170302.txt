Close but not quite close enough to warrant the full prize.
Uberestestness is typically measured and this is using a direct quote of the
definition taken from "EQ'ers alamanc on all things EQ'erry"

Top or "UBER" guilds rankings, are measured by

1/ The taunting of other guilds not only on your server but other servers
also on who or what you killed last.
*Bonus points will be awarded if you manage to insult the other guilds
members parentage or sexual habits preferences.

 2/having your   guilds web main page updated by the least socially
inept,experienced and all round well balanced guild member you have.
* Bonus points again if you get them to write sentences containing more
expletives than non expletives. Especially when commenting on "Gay loot, Gay
nerf's,Gay Encounters,Gay GM's basically anything that's Gay."

3/ Using forum message boards to inform the less uber members of the
community about a certain class that needs to be nerfed. Basing these
accusations on the realiable souces of....... Your guildmate Ninjadethfitz,
You seeing someone else with the audacity to be in the same zone, The
weasels that come in the night.
*Bonus points for taking the time to draw and then link pretty pictures. oh
sorry statistical graphs that show you're right and uber and everyone else
is wrong and a n00b.

4/ Being so UBER as to actually worry god forbid lose sleep over the fact
that someone else may do soemthing you haven't thought of, tried yet.

5/ Take offence at this random collection of words.
