Annie,

  Actually, you were suckered into the ole, "I can upgrade the cost of my
man toy because my wife shares a common interest in what it is used for.."
lol ;p  Just joking.  Talking about computers for any sicko's out there. ;p

  640 MB's should be a good enough amount, to quickly move data off of the
hard drive for the CPU to do with it as it will.. however, on the subject of
CPU, what make/version/speed is it?

 BTW, 640 is an odd amount.. totally acceptable (now-a-days) but odd.  I'm
assuming you had 512MB before and threw in a 128MB?  In any case, it should
be enough RAM especially if the Video Card is a good one with a decent
amount of onboard video RAM.
