      No, I don't think I did.  If had posted something to the effect
"OMG!  I've got a virus!  You all had better check your system to see if
you do too, here are the instructions." then yes, I would be spreading
it.  But I posted with skepticism.  Somewhere, somehow, I had heard
enough enough to make me doubt this was as it seemed to be.  Maybe
posting that my doubt, and receiving confirmation that it was well
placed, will stick in somebody's mind for when they get this message in
their email, a few months or years down the line.

   That I will agree to.
