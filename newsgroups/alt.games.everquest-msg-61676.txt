I believe the term here is "sucker". :)

I don't care how much someone claims they are camping a spot - if they
aren't there, they aren't camping it. If they don't know how to even
*get* there, there's no freaking way they're camping it.

Recent problem a friend experienced at Grimrot in SK (Prexus). My
friend comes to the camp, Grimrot is spawned. No one is at the camp -
she walked all the way around it to check. So, she kills Grimrot.

Shortly thereafter, some asswipe named Mylantor sends her a nastygram
that it was his camp and she KSed it. She told him that she checked
the entire camp, and no one was there - Mylantor replies that he was
at the Centaur town selling junk, and says that you're supposed to
/shout "camp check" before attacking Grimrot. Yeah. Right.

My friend explained two key facts: one - if you're not *at* the camp,
then it isn't your camp. You cannot camp Grimrot from the Centaur
village. Two - it isn't a killsteal if someone else hadn't engaged the
mob first. Since no one else was there, and my friend completely
soloed Grimrot, it wasn't a KS.

She missed one other key fact that she should have explained to
Mylantor, specifically that he was a moronic fuck. She has more tact
than I do.


Bottom line, apart from the fact that Verant has no policy on camp
disputes, if someone wants to claim a camp, they had damn well better
be there *first*, sitting on their ass, waiting for the spawn. Popping
in on a clock or claiming a camp from across a zone gives you no
rights whatsoever.
