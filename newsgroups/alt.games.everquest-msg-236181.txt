After reading most of the posts on this topic I think the problem is
not the player, not the programmer, and not the QA department but
rather SOE management.

The player
	Exploits are a part of life and there will always be people
who take advantage.  Fight the good fight against these people but it
is eternal, accept it.

The programmer
	Even the best programmers make mistakes or write something
that has an unintended affect.

The QA department
	They do what they can but they have a timeline, no matter what
else


SOE management
	The directive is to put out a money making product asap,
regardless of flaws.  After all this is not a car or an airplane,
people will not die if it craps out


The core developers of EQ (now Sigil) gave up a lot of money because
they weren't willing to put the game out on SOE's timeline.  They
wanted to release a game that was as good as they could reasonably
make it without mass player interaction.  After all, a QA department
will not think of every possible situation or combination that 400,000
people will come up with.
The desire for a good game has been lost by upper management.  This is
the basic problem IMO.
