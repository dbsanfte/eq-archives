You can certainly price the words like that, but I don't think you'll sell
them.  I think they'll just sit there and rot at prices like that.  After
all, you said yourself you weren't willing to pay that.  Think about a
person who might be willing to pay inflated prices.  Probably someone with
level 65 characters and a large bank account... but is that person really
going to spend so much time with a twink in their 20s that the spell will
make a difference?

Back before the bazaar, I played my necro solo up to 29 without ever getting
the 24 pet, so it isn't really that important, and probably a lot less so
today considering better gear and spots for faster exp.  And I would do the
same thing today if it meant saving 2000 plat.  That's just ridiculous.
Don't encourage this kind of thing by putting up more words at insane
prices. :-)
