Never had a high level help me in this situation.  Probably helped in the 
bitter "bah, train this bear to the tunnel and let THEM deal with it" 
attitude. :)  I do try NOT to do it, mind you, because it's not fair 
punishing everybody for one person's sins - but that tunnel is awfully 
tempting when it's the only thing close enough to get to before you die, 
and the chances of getting saved ARE usually better than they would be to 
*see* if a guard happens to be around one of the inns.
