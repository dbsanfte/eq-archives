DVD-ROM, I *think*, is better able to deal with scratches than CD-ROM.

There are slight differences between the in-game bonus items for your house.

DVD is a hell of a lot more convenient (two discs vs. something like 9).

DVD might be faster to install.  In theory, DVD drives can be made that are
much faster than CD drives, because both should have about the same limit on
rotational rate, but the DVD is higher data density.
