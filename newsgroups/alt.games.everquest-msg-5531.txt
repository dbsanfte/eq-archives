I've always been cynical. :)  Someone can have a bad day and be an asshole.
That same someone who is an asshole months later when asked about the first
event IS an asshole.

Life's too short to spend time trying to figure out a stranger's motivation
for being an ass.  I don't find it hard (anymore) to just write people off
as losers and forget them and go on with my life.  Thank god for killfiles,
for instance. :)
