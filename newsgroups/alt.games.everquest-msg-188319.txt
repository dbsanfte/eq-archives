Ok . . . I've read *almost* all of the posts in this thread and have seen it
said many times that a rez is just a courtesy and not needed for the benefit
of the group.  Unfortunately, I can't agree with that and I haven't seen
this point made.  My main is a lvl 32 chanter who was stuck at lvl 29 for
about a month from not playing much for xp . . . there were probably about 4
times where I died and lost my lvl . . . for anyone that's ever played a
chanter you know how detrimental that can be for a chanter...lvl 29 is your
clarity spell...can't be casted when you lose xp back to lvl 28 . . . I'm
sure every other class could potentially be in the same predicament.  So in
light of that, the loss of xp not gotten back from a rez REALLY could be
detrimental to the group.   There is no excuse for anyone acting like a
jerk....but IMO, if you are in a group with someone then you should rez them
if needed regardless and then deal with their rude behavior in other ways.
Of course this is just my 2cp and everyone is entitled to their own . . . :)
