Hmm I dunno..

Those DL spiders were one of the toughest mobs I've fought (for their
level).. even at level 60, they can take my hp down while I kill them (gotta
love DS's)

When I've been to kaesero (level 60 only), I can fight like 10 of the things
and be at similar HP to that if I fought 1 DL spider

Well he did say "spiders for all levels" - so I listed a guide to killing
spiders from 30-60 (before 30, sro, nro?, WC, gfay)
