But your character is not reading a book - she's meditating. The
concept of meditation usually entails closed eyes, or at the very
least intense concentration that blocks out most other stimuli.

Were Verant to truly simulate this, your screen would simply go blank.
Instead, we're able to communicate with everyone in the game without
difficulty, we're able to hear what's going on around us, and for the
easily amused, there's EQGems.

Surely you agree that to regain one's mana should take some time. What
would you suggest as an alternative to meditation to accomplish this?
There has to be some mechanism, and while I fully agree that looking
at the spellbook is far from thrilling, I don't consider it
"suffering".

My primary character has long since passed 35 and no longer needs to
stare at the spellbook when meditating. You know what I've discovered?
That it doesn't really make all that much difference in terms of what
information is available to me. Sure, the view changes, but I can
still only see in limited directions, my communications ability is the
same as when I was staring at the book, and I'm still sitting on my
ass waiting for the mana to come back.

I just don't see it as that big a deal.
