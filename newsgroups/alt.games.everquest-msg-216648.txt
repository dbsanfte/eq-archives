I haven't seen the slaughter missions going up past 60 yet in any L65
missions but they are definately playing with the drop rates on collect
and the mission goals. When I first started doing mission when LDoN came
out there were collect 50+ missions in some dungeons. These were easy to
do, usually doable before completing much more than 50% of the dungeon.
Other dungeons had collect 20-25 missions which were much harder,
needing almost 100% of the dungeon to be cleared to find the required
number. In my experience for the last part of last week, all missons
seem to be in the 20-30 range now and there are more items to collect
than the first week of LDoN, making them a lot more winnable than they
were earlier. Have you tried collect missions recently? 

Granted, L65 missions are probably the hardest to tune, as the
difference between a newly turned L65 with a few aa and a raid guild L65
with 100+ is huge. Tuning for the 100+ aa characters is going to make
the missions unwinnable by the basic L65 people.
