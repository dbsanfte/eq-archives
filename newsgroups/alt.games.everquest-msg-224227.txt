Well, I'm in a guild that is actually three guilds.
We have the same RL person as commander, but three
different in-game commanders. Just last night, guild
leader C was asking person D where her father was
(guild leader A) so that C could ask A for D's hand
in marriage. (BTW, A is married to E, guild leader
B is married to F, who are all the same person in
RL as D.)

I'm still boggling........
