Well, the rez limit on duels is 5 minutes, so you can't leave a dueled 
corpse for any length of time, but with planning you can use duels to do 
this.
What you do is have all melee bind in one spot (GFay wiz spires for us) 
and all casters bind right at ent to zone (could have everyone bind with 
melee, but want casters to be able to get in quickly).  You need a 
revive capable person at the bind point, and a fast-kill dueler if you 
want to try to use not lose any exp.  Since we're exploring VP for the 
first time, and dying regularly, we just rotated people out after a 
wipeout.  Basically if you were dead and ready to call it a night, you 
told the rezzing cleric to hold off, had the pally duel and kill you, the 
cleric rez, then loot fast, and have pally revive. 
It's not perfect, but better than staying in VP for 3 weeks.
