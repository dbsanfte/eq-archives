Are you sure about that?  That really doesn't jibe with what I'm
seeing.  I normally wield an 18del in my primary, with my 26del epic
in my off-hand.  If I keep the epic in my main hand it procs very
regularly, and in constant exp pulling will proc enough to keep the
buff as long as the pulls keep coming.  If I put the epic in my
off-hand, I don't gear nearly as many procs.  If I've got a dex buff I
can pretty much keep the buff up, but it will drop on occasion.  I pop
it into primary hand and it seems to proc almost immediately.  Yeah,
it's anecdotal, but I think I may have a way to log and test this.
