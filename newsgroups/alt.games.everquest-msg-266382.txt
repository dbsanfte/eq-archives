Actually I had one of those surreal moments I watched the web page
count down to zero and they had a cute little "flash" movie which
ended with "Are you still here... Go play".

Gee I'd like to but I was one of the dumb asses who pre order the DVD
version and called EBgames and gets, "CD version is in, but not the
DVD version. We'll call you when it comes in..."

If Sony was hoping to get people to move to DVD to cut cost on numbers
of disks needed to publish a game... strike one. Won't make that
mistake again.
