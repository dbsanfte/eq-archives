As a Ranger U can use Hide & sneak to do quests, I as a half elf ranger
starting on my epic needed to get my "Keepers of the Art" faction up to
amiable (Casters guilds in Felwithe). Starting off at dubious they would not
let me do any quests to raise it. Using both Hide & Sneak I conned
indiferent to them & started doing faction quests, which intailed handing in
4 bat wings. I'm now amiable to them. So my point is yes U can use Cammo to
do quests but only in conjunction with sneak....sub hide for cammo, same
thing. Apparently the Citizens of Norrath have good hearing....hehhe
