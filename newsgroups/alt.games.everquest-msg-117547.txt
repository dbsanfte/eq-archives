I don't think that you have this right.

As I understand it only one *specialisation* can go above 50.
I think you are looking at the skill levels for your normal casting
abilities.

Eg. for Evocation you will have Evocation and Specialize : Evocation
At 36 I would guess that you main specialization is about 30-40 with the
other lagging behind a bit. And that you main casting skills are all
150+

Your best bet is to put on logging play for a few hours and then use a
log parser to check your skill levels. 
YOu can obviously see your normal skill levels in the "skills" window.

HTH,

Jim
