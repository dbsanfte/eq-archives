Oh I agree completely. Personally I have never sworn in EQ without
consciously not knowing it.

There is no real excuse for profanity in EQ, but I CAN understand how it may
happen without the person typing it really meaning to.

The 'how fast does the brain think' is an interesting question. We can
think faster than we can talk, yet we still do not always have 100% control
over what we say.

It is very easy in certain circumstances to forget where you are. We are
human after all.
