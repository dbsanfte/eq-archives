Hate to say it, but this router sucks.  I have it.  I have just replaced it.
This is a known problem, and the new firmware didnt fix in my case.

Also check your actual cable modem.  When you lose your connection, try
unplugging the cable modem to reset instead of the router and see if thats
the prob.
