Same as the support classes. 

Post-50 you aren't tanks - Tanks are warriors, SKs and Paladins (in that
order). Your job isn't to take damage, it's to deal damage. Casters use
mana to do damage, you use your weapons, but the same agro-management
rules apply. You may be able to stand a few more rounds against an
ubermob, and even hold your own in an exp group if needed, but over a
long term, mana is better spent healing high hp/ac tanks. On raids you
need the hp/resists to get through the AEs

BTW, great post - you'd be surprised how many people don't realise it
