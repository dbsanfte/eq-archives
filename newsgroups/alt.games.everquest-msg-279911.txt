Another reason, though not as much of an issue, is that a single-target
elixir will block/overwrite a slightly lesser-powered but *much* longer
lasting AE HoT.

Starting a derail now...

You know, that has been said many times over the past *years*, and I still
keep junk buffs in my top 2 slots and can count the number of times a mob
dispel has taken an unplanned buff on one hand, versus the thousands and

the way from Guk to Anguish and everything, literally everything, in
between.
