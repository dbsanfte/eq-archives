I would say go for SK & Shammy.  Great combo, one buffs & heals, regens,
etc... the other fights & debuffs.  Just get a KEI every 2.5-whatever hours
to keep the mana bar full & you'll level like crazy with that team.  Barb
shammy is one of the better & the frog's are alright but from my experience
they level much harder than Barb's or DE's, too bad DE's dont have a shammy,
which is BS but thats for a different discussion.

Other options are...
SK/Cleric = great combo, no buffs other than cleric buffs but heals are more
mana-efficient to say the least, plus partial rez's at various levels.
Necro/Cleric = killer combo, great way to get mad XP.  Necro pets are very
powerful & the necro spell line is very fun =0)
Mage/Cleric = great combo as well, pets get some "special" abilities but you
need gems to make em instead of easy to get bone chips
Necro or SK/Wiz = Insane combo at high lvls, never tried it at lower lvls'
so I cant help you there

As for Druids, they are find for PL'ing but for a 2 person grp they aren't
exactly what you need.  A Shammy is better IMO than a Druid for a 2 party
grp.

GL tho, it's not hard to get to lvl 12 with noob gear, so try some things
out, fool around, try this or that, just enjoy your playing =0)
