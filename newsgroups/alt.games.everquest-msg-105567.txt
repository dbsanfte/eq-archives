No, he's clearly stating that the 40% number is NOT applied to delay,
but to the damage you do due to attacking more often. He could be
clearer but from his examples he is definately referring to number of
attacks.

What you are missing is the context of the article. He is explaining
the difference between 40% reduction of delay (false) and 40% increase
in attacks (true) when it comes to haste percentages.

There isn't any conflicting information. Haste as defined by most
people is percentage increase in attacks over any given time period.
The end.
