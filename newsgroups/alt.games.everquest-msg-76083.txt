At higher levels, when you start getting significant damage bonuses, you
will want to put the fastest weapon possible in your primary slot, so you
get to add your damage bonuses more often.  At level 15, if you have say a
Rusty Short Sword 4 damage, 28 delay and a Brazen Brass Kilij 10 damage, 35
delay, then you are best off with the higher damage weapon in your primary
hand.  However, at level 52, you would want to swap those weapons, so that
the 4/28 was in your primary hand, you will do more damage overall that way.
This is an extreme example, but something to keep in mind as you level.
(This example was run at STR of 100 on Copeland's weapon analyzer).
