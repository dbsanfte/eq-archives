No. As I said, SKs hold aggro better than anyone. I'm merely saying
that a reasonably equipped monk could meet the definition of a "tank"
at the time, based on your strictures--that they be able to soak up
damage and hold aggro.

At the level I was playing before the nerf, I saw monks tank MObs from
Black Reavers to Vindi. At the time, it would take a Black Reaver
about 30 seconds to eat through me.

Even today, when I've been pressed into emergency service to tank MObs
like Gaukr Sandstorm, I can rarely hold up long enough to prevent a
TPW, even with a cleric and shaman both trying to keep me alive.

It may be that the curve flattens out near the top, but I submit that
class balance issues are not and should not be decided based on how
the game plays out among the 0.1% of players who make it to Vex Thal /
Elemental Planes.

There is simply no case to be made that monks and rogues were even
close to equal as tanks pre-nerf, except maybe at the very top. The
most casual observation would simply have proven it false. Monks were
capable tanks, while rogue were what they have always been--high DPS
melees with the tanking ability of dry paper bags who lose most of
their DPS when they *do* try to tank.

>lololol..  maybe your server has a different version of EQ to mine then.

I'm not sure which statement you're laughing at. Without Escape, we
pull like warriors with less hit points. And, in emergencies, when the
real tank goes down, I'll put my money on the similarly-equipped
ranger ahead of me every single time. There's a reason there are lots
of weaponshield strategies, but to date, no counterattack ones.

>Best scout in the game, pre and post PoP

Not in any guild I've ever been in. Rangers still do most of our
scouting, being much faster at it. If you don't need LoS on a MOb to
confirm it's up, you're *way* ahead of the game.

Of course, our monks still try to do CRs in zones with draggro, too.
It's been a hard road convincing them that SoS rogues are now *much*
better at it.

>seb, period.

A few things need to be remembered here:
(1) Moulin is a twink. I started out with the best gear that a level
55 necro could buy after liquidating his own gear, including a fungi.
Then, I was further twinked with a level 60 uber-rogue's second-best
gear. I returned my borrowed items at 55 and took off my last piece of
twink gear at level 63. You were untwinked and routinely mention just
how ghetto your gear was.

(2) Both of us were anomylous. I had plenty of rogues tell me that
soloing was impossible. I saw plenty of monks doing so.

(3) I could solo *one* caster in Guk, usually. I never moved much past
the first two spawn and, if I missed one, I had to wait for the next
group passing through to break the spawn again, until I finally got my
DB'ed cleric an OS key. And, I missed a LOT, because I had to
breastplate heal, often in between kills.

(4) Most of my soloing was done with cleric buffs, potions, poisons,
and DBed healing in between fights.

In all of my uber soloing time, I accumulated a grand total of 17 AAs
before PoP.

As I said, monks had top 3 AA slots in my guild. Nobody AE'd Acrylia
because of all the harm touches. I used to farm acrylia in Grimling
Forest on the Acrylia zone line and not see another soul in the zone
for DAYS at a time. Nobody AE'd the Grey because of Shimmering
Rockfiends. And OS was constantly crowded. (Plus, I had mentioned
rather loudly and profanely in guildchat how annoying I found AE
groups that wouldn't give up a single camp to an ordinary group and,
being guild leader, my words may have carried more weight than I had
intended them to.)

I was never able to solo FG. I spent most of my one-person xp time
db'ing the fire temple in Scarlet Desert--barely.

I'm talking about monks that were in their low-50s when I was, which
was late Velious, early Luclin. My previous melee experience was
pre-Kunark, old world only and did not josh with your statement. The
guild I was in wasn't even a raiding guild and it seemed that haste
items were de rigeur by 35.

"Traps" covers a whole panapoly of nasty triggered events in EQ, many
of which are neither detectable nor disarmable. And, with PoP, a fair
number of them break sneak/hide in spots that guarantee aggro.

For a rogue to have SoS and Escape, he needs a *minimum* of 33 AAs. I
won't have Escape until I hit 51 AAs. To my knowledge, not one rogue
in my entire NToV/AoW/Sleeper's/Ssra-level guild has it yet.

I believe it's called "flop rezzing." It requires your guild to have a
Staff of Forbidden Rites and either an entire twink team to take down
Vox regularly or millions of plat to recharge it. Only a handful of
guilds have the resources to do it. And, of course, rogues didn't
invent this technique. We learned it from monks.
