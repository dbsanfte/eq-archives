Did you ummm, spend a lot of money on fletching components?  :)

Hahahahaha!
Ok, that answers that.  :)

The most common bug was this:

Let's say you leave warder 3 (the 7500hps dot one--the one with the
REAL cool aggro message...man, I'm gonna miss him.)

Kill Ventani.

Sleeper doesn't wake up.

Next full spawn, you kill warders 1 and 2.

Then kill warder 3.  Boom!  Sleeper pops and vaporizes everything and
everyone in the zone.

Translation:  "Waaah, no more easy primal for us, no more SoDs, no
more gnome mask, no more resist stone (big deal), blah blah blah."

"Others experience ST"?  What a load of crock.
I'd say easily 99% of all EQ players will NEVER set foot in ST.  Hell,
how many people set foot in VP?

Should have been disease.
What do people who can kill Ventani have need for with PR?

Ok, so maybe SoL will have a dragon with Whoashit's AoE but with CHA 5
flag enabled....
