Well, taking into account that since you opened the game, you won't be able
to return it, you really have nothing to lose by trying your free month.  If
I were you I would try it out.  It's an awesome game from my point of view,
although you may not like it, some people don't.  I tell you what, why don't
you create a character on the Sullon Zek server (try to pick a good deity so
we won't be on opposite teams) and give me a tell in-game (my char name is
Mekail, so the command will be "/tell Mekail <whatever you want to say>").
I would be perfectly willing to show you the ropes, and you can try the game
and see if you like it.  Now, there will be people on this newsgroup who
will reply to this message saying, "No, absolutely not, do not play on
Sullon Zek under any circumstances whatsoever!"  Ignore them.  This is
because they are pussies who have not discovered the true joys of SZ.

Also, I get the impression you want to try it offline because you're afraid
the vet players will whup your ass if you go into the game not knowing what
you're doing.  Actually EQ is not really a "chase other players down and
shoot-em-up game".  While Sullon Zek is a PvP server where players are
allowed to kill each other, the vast majority of your fighting will be with
in-game AIs called NPCs (Non-Player Characters).  It's a roleplaying game,
not a first-person shooter.  There are many non-PvP servers where players
aren't allowed to fight each other, I find those boring though.  But even if
you play on a PvP server you can't be killed till level 6 anyway, so you'll
have time to learn the ropes before you have to start watching your back.

I'd suggest you try it.  You've got nothing to lose, just try it (people who
offer you crack might say much the same thing, notice the similarities).
Anyway, hope you decide to join the EQ community.
