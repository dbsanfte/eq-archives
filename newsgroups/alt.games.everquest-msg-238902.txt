For the enchanter, the wizard would probably be better since he can
snare.   For a cleric, not having anything to heal probably means a
bad partnership if you chose a wizard; magician would be a better
partner as the amge has a pet for the cleric to heal.  A better
choice, since you seem to be considering only INT casters,  that could
group with either well would be a necromancer. Necros are not just a
solo class; with a pet, DoTs, snare, etc., they have lots of
complimentary abilites with any partner.

Add non-INT casters as options, and you have several other good
choices.  
1) Paladin - a tank for the cleric.  He could use the haste and slow
from the chanter and can heal the chanter. 
2) SK - a tank for the cleric.  If the SK can heal, he could use the
haste and slow from the chanter.
3) Ranger - snare and SoW and low level heals for the chanter and good
DPS from range later. Snare and cleric fear means a lot of easy fear
kiting for the duo besides animals.     
4) Druid - snare, heals, and SoW for the chanter and good DPS from
DoTs or nukes. Not sure it would be that good a choice when grouped
with the cleric but it may work at later levels as a druid's charmed
pets still need heals. 
5) Beastlord - a pet and a tank for the cleric. Not sure how it would
duo with a chanter.
