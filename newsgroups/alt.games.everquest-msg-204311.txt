Its incredibly useful right up until you get Run 3.. .which is better than
insta click its never click!

SOW is then useful only for those rare times when you want to go faster than
Run 3 enough to bother digging the things out, or when facing certain
outdoor dispelling mobs, where any insta click buff item will save you a
whole lot of real buffs.

The fact that Run 3 also works indoors makes it, in a way, the best move
speed buff in the entire game.  Yes, its slower than JBoots, SOW, Selos...
but its a heck of a lot faster than any of the above once you've been
indoors for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 2 minutes... heck, I think SOE with
extended enhancement gear and such can last a couple hours... but eventually
the only thing left -will- be Run.
