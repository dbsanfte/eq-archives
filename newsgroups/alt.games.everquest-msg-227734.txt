I know what she said and like I said I have the capacity for invis using my
GVD. Any other high level Cleric worth his salt would have one as well. And
yes before I did have my GVD I did buy cloudy potions and still do when I
know I will be needing them. Just dont assume every Cleric needs to be "baby
footed" around.
