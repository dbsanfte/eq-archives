Well, as far as creativity is conserned I think this will allow
for some very unique things to happen.  People who go to
all cloth armor, or people who carry around large sums
of money, or whatever.  Should be fun to see what people
do to get their charms more powerful.
However, if one slot was No Drop only and, lets say the
items could only be found by questing.  This would
encourage some people to try out something new.  It
could also have the benefit of being an 'untwinkable'
slot.  (Yes, I know it could be twinked, but not as easily
as say, buying a Lamentation for a 1st level warrior)
As far as the player only made slot, I think that would be
cool because then some players who have worked hard
on trade skills might get rewarded.  Especially some of
those in pottery and baking.
Although, I wonder, where do charms come from?
Quest? MOB? Since none of those 3 are No Drop are
they all tradeable?
