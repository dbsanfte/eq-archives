I happened to be looking thru the keyboard mapping options and ran
into a "stop casting" key, which I think by default is mapped to
shift-S (this is from memory, which is often wrong).  If it works you
could use this all the time instead of ducking to interrupt casting...
wouldn't have to worry about whether you had an eye up or not.
