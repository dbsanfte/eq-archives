It's just the pet acknowledging your command.

When you summon a pet, it's in "guard mode" by default, so telling
it to guard you is kind of redundant.  The pet can do other things
besides guard you, though, and hearing the pet's acknowledgement
upon changing modes can be handy, expecially for party members who
have no other way of knowing.
