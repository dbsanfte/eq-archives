	Can you 3-box the other item with untwinked characters who aren't 
wearing a single piece of raid gear?

	And you neglect to mention that non-raiders also go through many sets 
of gear and many trials and tribulations. Here's a thought, why don't 
you go to veksar, gear up a tank with that stuff, then try some hard 
LDoN's? Or try tanking a DoN with 50k worth of bazaar gear!

	Everyone in the game goes through a procession of gear sets Faned, it's 
just that the non-raiders go through sets of *pathetic* gear, whereas 
raiders go through sets of *awesome* gear. What Loral is arguing is that 
non-raiders should go through sets of *decent* gear, whereas raiders go 
through sets of *Awesome* gear.

	This comes back to the hoary old argument that raid time should be 
worth more than group time, and that not only should it be worth more, 
it should be worth 3x more!

	You make it sound like 50 people work for a year on one upgrade for one 
guy :P Most 3raids/week raiders I know seem to get 1-2 upgrades a month 
depending on how uber their gear already is.

	Hey a lot of single group content falls into that category. God the 
amount of time and effort people in my guild blew getting into KT was 
phenomenal. Try THAT with LDoN gear!

	It's funny how people who are benefiting from a system rarely speak out 
against it. Or is that funny? hmm...
