Pet classes automatically have a  fair amount of sustained DPS due to the 
fact that there is melee involved.

I don't have a fungi (yet, I have one on the way eventually). Nor do I have 
my epic. Then again, at 54 some of Dreadlands is still dark blue, and cocks 
are easy fights. Once I hit 55 I am going to go all AA for another 4 
points- that will bump my Regen1 to 3 and give me the first level of crits. 
After that, it's back to leveling.

I do agree that melees get the shaft when it comes to soloing- monks still 
solo better than rogues or warriors though.
