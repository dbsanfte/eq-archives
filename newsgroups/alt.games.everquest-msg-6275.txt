Yeah, I'm currently using one of a couple of higher level druids (35 or 51,
depending on which of my friends is currently online so I can borrow the
other one) to PL my wizard taxi.  He's got a little over 2 days /played and
is level 25.  But that's a huge exception to what I normally do...I really
do want him just as a taxi.  I have never found wizards to be much fun.
