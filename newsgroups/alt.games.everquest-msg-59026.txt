  I generally haven't had anybody "gawk" at my efforts to roleplay, but then
again, I don't use mangled Middle English when I RP and don't get TOO
imagininative with the way I phrase things.  Usually I speak in relatively
normal terms, but I just address the world as if it were a REAL living and
breathing world, instead of a game.  I treat generally treat NPCs as
conscious entities, or roleplay my lack of HP like my character is actually
injured, ect.  Roleplaying is more a frame of mind than anything else, in my
opinion.  When I roleplay, I try to roleplay in a manner which even
non-RPers can easily understand... even if they don't choose to participate.

  People, even roleplayers, tend not to roleplay a lot in groups, because
the functioning of the group is paramount (in the minds of most players).
Anything that's viewed as potentially endangering to the group or even
hindering to the efficiency of the group is often not recieved warmly, for
obviously reasons.  Though it's not really a good mindset to have to enjoy
the game as a roleplay world, it is a good mindset if you value the gameplay
experience and advancement as important.

  Despite whatever claims Verant makes, though, the mindset of the game's
designers was not to create an enviroment that provides fertile ground for
roleplay.  Their main intent was to create a graphical fantasy PvE MUD whose
main attraction is gameplay firstly and the social aspect secondly that
would be popular to a wide audiance, and they've succeeded in that regard.
Token efforts have been made to make the game more roleplay-friendly, but
it's the core fundamentals of a game that will determine whether or not it
makes a good RP world, not the "little extras".

  I suppose so, except the gameplay is not much like Quake.  It's more like
a console RPG, except there are many other players, and there is no cohesive
plot which is meaningful to most of the players.  Players can create their
own plots amongst themselves and create personal RP-centric goals, but most
people fall in to the pattern of behavior which the game encourages: to
attempt to gain experience and loot as efficiently as is possible.
