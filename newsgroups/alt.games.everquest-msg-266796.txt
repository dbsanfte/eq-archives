I remember my introduction to on-line gaming was in the old days of
Meridian59. I think I played there for about two years before EQ1 came out.
I remember that every Christmas players received a 'gift from the gods'. A
useful  item that was not available in the  game. (Not that anything very
much was available anyway in that game but it was a nice idea).

It would be a nice feature if Sony did something like that. Say a special
item once a year and slightly better for each year you had played (and
paid). You could say get a 12 slot 100% WR bag the first year, an any slot
decent augment the second and so on.

They key word of course is useful. Sony seem to prefer freebies that the
average player would consider junk! Any thoughts
