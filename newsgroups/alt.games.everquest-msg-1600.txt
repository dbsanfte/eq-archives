Even though you are a bit young to solo HGs Rathe Mts they drop good cash up
to 50pp plus low end gems and FS weapons.. In a decent group you can earn
300-500pp in an evening not to mention some good exp. HGs are 35-38 Soloing
HGs I have made 1-2k in an 8 hour period as 49 Shaman. I still go back to
Rathe Mts anytime I am in need of some quick Plat.
