You said a rogue tanking, not a rogue soloing.  Self PLing is no different
to that rogue hooking up with say, my cleric instead and duoing.

I've seen a rogue tank the monk epic fights and Dain, as 2 examples.  Theres
very few mobs that NEED 7k hp and defensive, otherwise, anything over 5khp
is "good enough" (not optimal, but hey if it does the job)

Any melee class can get over 5k hitpoints if they are determined (even those
guildless/in small guilds)

Some mobs you can't fight from behind... Dain and the Itraer Vius come to
mind
