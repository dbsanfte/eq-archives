FIrst off, they've only tested it on the test server.
No matter how many times they say it, people don't seem to get "test
server." Second of all, did it ever occur to anyone that maybe they
JUST don't want people to know the exact number of players ON THE TEST
SERVER ONLY? 

In case you don't know, there is a very REAL reason why they don't,
many people playing there now use the test server as their Utopian low
number MAIN play server. This was why there was so much wailing over
the character delete and they restored them naked later. It wasn't
people screwing around and "testing" on the test server but rather
people viewing and playing on the test server as their MAIN server.
Therefore they have a very VALID reason for people to not see right
away the low number of 200 or so people on the test server making it
look like a utopia to some or possibly making someone decide NOT to
TEST since there are not enough people on it for them.

The only reason that makes sense why they may do this on the live
servers eventually is that:

Something I did not see mentioned by others here, some new players
open up the server list and instead of getting on the servers  ranked
as lowest, they get on the HIGHEST population server thinking since
they have the most people they must be the best and also have the most
possible friends/people to help them out.

Meanwhile if verant just puts them in an order without a number, the
new player will probably get on one of the first ones.

Really people should not be freaking out about something on test, it
could just be for test ONLY or just be a "test." Verant would say the
exact same thing.
