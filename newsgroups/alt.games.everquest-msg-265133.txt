At last year's event I took in my highest character, a Necro, and started
killing left, right, and centre (and being killed twice).  I left a few
items to rot, with /oocs of where they could be found.  However, I got what
I was after, 200 bone chips in the bank.

What server are you on?  I'm on Xegony, name's Gwylliam Frankenstine (I can
always make a friend).
