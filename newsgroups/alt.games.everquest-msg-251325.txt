Easy solution.   Don't buy it.  If the player doesn't sell the item, he
either has to lower the price or use up mule space to store it indefinitely.
If he does sell the item, then it was obviously an agreeable price to
someone.

I don't see why Sony has to come in and "fix" the price at a level where you
think it should be.

And how the hell do you think they would even do it?  If they did go for
your insane plan, people would simply switch back to /auction selling so
they could get the true market price.  What then?  If you think they would
start detailing GM's to monitor every player / player trade, to make sure
people aren't violating the price caps, you're dreaming.
