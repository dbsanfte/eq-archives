>Lvl 1 - 8 or 9: Field Of Bone.  Good xp and lots of wonderful bone chips drop
>that you can sell in bazaar.

Bone chips are also very good for leveling. Turn bone chips in 4
unstacked at a time to Gunlok in Kaladim, for really good exp (for the
effort) up to level 14 to 16, nifty faction, and still make some money
back. (You get 1 to 9gp per stack (in tattered armor, rusty weapons,
and lightsources), depending on how lucky you are.) If I ever find
bone chips for 1pp a stack, I snatch 'em up quick. And I love finding
them on merchants, because you actually make a profit most of the
time. (Believe it or not, if you turn in enough of them you can still
level off of them in your mid 20s.)
