GMs do yes.

Guides eventually sort of do if they do it for long
enough. They then get their $9.95 fee waived
even though they are expected to only guide for
10 hours a week or something.

I still don't understand someone guiding though
really, its still doing Customer Service work and possibly
the worst of it and for free when you could be playing yourself
on a regular character or getting things done in real life, or making
money in real life.
