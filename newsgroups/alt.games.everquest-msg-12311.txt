Nah.  /quit saves you.

All it does is force you to go Linkdead.    Same as unplugging your modem.
It will leave your character logged in and helpless for about two minutes
before its status is saved and it is logged out.

So, whether it is dangerous or all depends on where you are.     If you're in
the middle of a fight, you're probably going to log back in dead.    If you're
running around town, it's harmless, just a bit annoying.
