I'm not one to just bash a company, but I've *finally* received the chance
to deal with their shoddy tech support.  Of course they tried to blame it on
hardware drivers (i.e. "Are they all up to date?"  when I said "Yes", they
would say "Do it again"....c'mon, really now!), they even told me to do a
complete OS reformat (you should not have to do this to run *any* program.
Mind you I had reformatted like 4 times before contacting them.).  They also
told me to disable my "unsupported sound card" that has been running this
game for over a year and is listed as "supported" on their own web site.

I'm not going to bash them, but they better get it fixed or they lose this
customer.  Not a bash at all, I just can't see paying for what I can't play.

And NO!!!!  You can't have my stuff!!!!  How can I give it away if I get
kicked even by the patcher???
