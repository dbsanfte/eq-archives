According to a Fippy's facts some time ago, the least used race/sex of
all is a female troll. The least played races in general are Ogre and
troll.

So if you want to be a unique character, be a female troll anything.

http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/fippy_facts.jsp?id=43095

Trolls are the lowest of all, by the entire playerbase, at 
3.5% of the entire player base. 
Of that 3.5 percent:

Troll Male 86.9%  
Female 13.1% 

So as you can see, troll female would be a pretty low percentage.
Don't worry about being a troll female if you are really male, no one
is going to come on to you anyway, I guaruntee it! You can roleplay 
it and have lots of fun.

Ogres were 3.8% with:

Ogre Male 88.8%  
Female 11.2% 

So there again, female ogre would be very rare. Big surprises here,
eh? 

The rarest class that the ogre or troll could be would probably be 
beastlord or Shadowknight. There was a fippy's facts about classes
too, I think, but when I try to look at the archives it says "Station
is being updated." I think it always says that.
