Actually, I believe the hit has to land to generate any significant hate.
Just swinging at a mob is kind of like using beg.  It puts you on the hate
list, but at a value of 0, or very close to it.

It seems to depend on the type of spell, in my experience (Mostly procs)
Resisted stuns generate some or little aggro, while resisted debuffs
generate more aggro than successful ones.   Which sort of makes sense.  In
terms of "what will let the mob win easiest", killing a shaman thats about
to slow you (you know he is cause he tried once already) is much more
effective than killing a shaman that successfully slowed you.  Killing a
wizard that can't really nuke you doesn't help as much as killing the one
that is landing for full.

Hate does indeed decay, just never completely without Memblur, Atone, Rogue
Escape AA, or some similar method.  You can still be on the hate list with a
0 value, and it will still try and kill you assuming nobody else is higher.

The fact hate decays came out during the Conquest (exploits in Sleepers
Tomb) discussion, and was confirmed by a Verant representative.  Building up
tons of hate doesn't give you a huge aggro lead, if you sit around and do
nothing for a while.  (They were accused, among other things, of using right
click spells to build aggro while the mob could not reach them.  Then coming
out later with the MT fully aggroed. They contended that they weren't doing
it, since they were waiting in their safe spot too long, any aggro would
have faded, and the Verant rep conceded that point.)

Mobs care more about "What have you done to me lately?" than "What have you
done to me?"  Pausing in between nukes really has a double benefit.   It
allows the tanks to increase thier hate relative to yours, and it also gives
a little time for your own hate to start to fade.
