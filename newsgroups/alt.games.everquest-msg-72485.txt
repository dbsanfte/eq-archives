>i installed velious. now when i hit 'i' instead of getting the nice inventory, its like got all my stuff but like in a black table, not the nice old blue squares lay out. Up side is u can see thru table so nothing sneaks up, but i hate look of it. If u right click an object text overlaps onto ur money bar so text is messed up as backgrounds are like smokey colour almost transparent. can u revert to old, pre velious display?

Oh dear god, my eyes! My eyes!

concerned) not in EMail...
