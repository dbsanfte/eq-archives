So what?  You can't get your stamina over 100?

Invigor is a worthless spell in almost all situations.

So would anyone.  But if I had to choose between one with .4 weight
for 20.1k and another at 8 weight for 20K, all else held constant, I
would save my 100 plat.

Never argued this.  However I will point out that a Ranger's greatest
liabilities are not in his lack of available AC gear.  It is in his
poor innate defensive skills and HP.

Rangers aren't easily outdamaged by most other melees.  This is just
out-and-out false.  Up through the 50's, they do comparable and maybe
even better damage than Warriors (Rangers concentrate on DPS weapons,
Warriors concentrate on aggro weapons), better damage than Bards, and
better damage than knight classes.  The only melee classes that will
usually hold an advantage are rogues and monks.  Of course we don't
need to talk about the kind of damage they do past 60 with some AA's.

If by that you mean you avoid aggro, good.

Yes all good stuff.  However your claim that Rangers have a shitty
weapon selection is outrageously false.

No actually we were talking about Ranger weapon selection versus other
class's weapon selection.

And I wouldn't give up track for either.

The only way you can claim they get nicer weapons easier and sooner
is:

1) You only look at the low levels, and even then I think you are
wrong.  However I didn't quest for weapons, I just saved up and bought
them in EC.

2) You compare one-handers for knights to one-handers for dual
wielding classes.  This is a poor comparion to make, as should be
obvious to you.

> We get to fear animals while the SK can fear anything.

Yes, using more mana for his fear and much more mana for his inferior
snare.  (lasts 1 minute, doesn't slow the mob as much, and the DoT
with it is relatively worthless).  Meanwhile he will kill the mob much
faster.

I don't know how this turned suddenly to soloing.  However now that it
has...the Ranger can track the best mob for him to kill.  The Ranger
can heal himself after the battle.  The Ranger can root/snare and
shoot a mob down (moreso at the higher levels of course).  The Ranger
can kill the mob faster.  The Ranger can SoW or SoE himself.  The
Ranger can harmony pull outdoors.  The Ranger can damage shield
himself.

None of these things make the Ranger superior, but I simply mean to
point out that different classes have their strengths and weaknesses. 
And it is certainly not clear that SKs are a better soloing class.

Ah now you want to talk about farming.

Let's see any class other than a Ranger or Druid farm an Iksar BP or
Iksar hide mask.  Let's see any class other than a Ranger or Druid
outpull hill giants in Rathe.  Let's see any class other than a Ranger
(and to a lesser extent a Druid) happen to run through a zone,
casually hit track, and notice a rare mob up.  Heading to Katta?  See
if the Runner is up.  Heading to Sebilis?  See what named are up in
Trakanon.  Heading to the Theatre in Veksar?  See if the rotting
shopkeeper is up.  Going to kill Lodizol?  See if Stormfeather is up. 
Going to camp Stormfeather?  See if Lodizol is up.  Going to Umbral? 
See if the Thought Horror is up.

It is nothing more than a DoT, and a crappy one at that.  (Let it get
aggro on an exp mob and it will die with one or two hits)  Meanwhile
the Ranger will outdamage the SK *without* having to waste mana
casting DoTs.

(And the best snare in the game...at least the best single-target
snare)

When I solo with my Ranger I never cast any offensive damage spells. 
I am better off killing the mob with either my bow or my weapons and
using my mana to heal afterward.

...not to mention no snare.

The Paladin, under 50% health, runs slower than the mob attacking him.
 The Ranger, with SoW up, still outruns the mob.
