> TRAIN THAT WAS CAUSED BY YOU:
>
Well - back in my newbie days I was a 9'ish shammy who was looking down the
hole in the middle of Blackburrow and seeing some gnolls all the way down
the bottom.

"Wonder what happens if I drop my shiny new nuke on that gnoll's head?"
*casts*
"hmmn - he just ran off, oh well...."

Then I start hearing shouts of "Train" and I wonder what that means but am
still idley looking over the lip of the hole and around the top. Then
everything went quiet again so I was starting to relax again.

Then the explosion happened, out a hallway a wall of blue gnoll flesh with a
few specks of hapless bystanders gush forth heading straight towards me. In
my fright I hit the wrong key and fell down the hole in the middle.
Realising I was hopelessly lost I just swam to a ledge and consulted my
maps...

Yep, you can guess what happened, a train from the bottom to the top and all
the way back down to the bottom again. Before it reached me down below I had
walked into a mob and got stomped, causing a derail right on top of the last
surviviours huddling in there hidey holes. It was like flushing a pipe bomb
down a toilet. When I came to in the hallway there was a dazed mass of
newbie cloth wearing PC's uttering phrases like:

"Never EVER seen anything like that"
"Anyone get a screen shot?"
"FRIGGIN HUGE"
"WTF was that?"
"Who TF did that?"

By this time the 2+2 had worked it's way through my thickened skull and I
fessed up my suspicions I may have caused it. To my surpise most of the
folks had a great  laugh and only a few were angry : )
