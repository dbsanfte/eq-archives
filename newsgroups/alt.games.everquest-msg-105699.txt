Not to mention that innoruuk.com forums at least have an entire section 
devoted to buying and selling MQs.  I would think if it were in any way 
frowned upon, the forum would be closed down.  (Posts that mention ShowEQ 
or EQW are removed by the moderators.)
Verant knows about MQ.  They at the very least tolerate MQ.
