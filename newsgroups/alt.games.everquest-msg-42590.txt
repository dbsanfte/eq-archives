I have found that using the area mesmerization spell in areas that could
"overpopulate" quickly
works better than trying to target individual mobs. I let the main tank
bring the crowd in, area
mez the group of them, and then have the main pull the one out that he/she
wants. The group
pulls away from the mob of mobs and then I either move in to keep them
stunned with the color
line of spells, mixing in whirl til you hurl on any that break early. Or I
just keep one of the mezd
mobs targeted and start counting ticks... I have it figured out that 95% of
the time I am area
mezzing at about the same time that they are breaking free.

Pro: mana efficiency - 1 spell on 5 mobs cannot be beat.
        simplicity - no funky macros to keep up with
        easy tactics to teach to a new group (not every group has experience
with enchanters)
Con: mob aggro - mobs seem to aggro on me if I do not keep them area mezd.
easy fix - pet
        resistance - it always seems that mobs seem to resist this spell
just a tiny bit easier than single mez
        area effect - do NOT let the mob get too close to you. The area mez
spell will nail you as well as them!

I know this does not answer your question about macros, but hopefully you
will find it useful anyway. I have used
these tactics to much success in ill omen in the sarnak fort as well as in
crushbone and even in blackburrow. these are
the worst areas for multiple mobs that I know of. One word of advice: no
tactic I know of has worked successfully in
the warrens. When VI created this zone, they must have been in a
particularly sadistic mood! ;-) I still get chased out
of the warrens often by beasties that are so green that I can drop them in 1
nuke. Unfortunately they usually bring about
35 of their brothers and I cant cast while getting constantly nipped on the
ankles. Curse them ankle biters! ;-)
