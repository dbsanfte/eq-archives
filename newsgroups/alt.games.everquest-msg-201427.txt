Two Opal Encrusted Steins, adds 50 Charisma, enough for most folks to get 
best prices with most merchants.  They can usually be had for about 20pp 
each, or much cheaper if you find the merchant that someone like me sold 
them to while skilling up in pottery, or happen to be around when I am 
giving them away because they are not worth the time it takes to sell them.
