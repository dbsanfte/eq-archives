Actually, the big problem is that you would need to port DirectX to the Mac 
(and Linux).  Only Microsoft could even _try_ to do that, and they will not.

The only other alternative is for Verant to rewrite EQ from scratch to not 
use DirectX - not only on the Mac, but on the PC as well, for DirectX games 
will not play with non-DirectX games.  Yes, that means rewriting the PC 
version from scratch.  Obviously, Verant will not do this.
