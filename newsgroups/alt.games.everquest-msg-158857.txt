Okay... you have two weapons. A Velium Two Handed sword (12/43 - procs a DD)
and a Velium Short Sword (4/23 - procs a DD).

Now, let's do a little thinking. Which do you think will proc more
times -per minute-? 4/23 or 12/43? The sword that swings every 2.3 seconds,
or the sword that swings every 4.3 seconds? Something tells me that
statistically, the 4/23 would proc more -per minute- than 12/43.

If you take the time to let the Velium Two Hander to swing the exact same
amount of times as the Velium Short Sword, yes, then they would have an
equal likelihood to proc.

Now picture 50% Haste on those swords... yeah, you swing more -per minute-.
Statistically, that would increase the amount of -chances- for the swords to
proc over a set period of time, but the proc rate remains the same over an
equivalent amount of attacks.

To summarize, if you let the swords swing an equal amount of times over an
unlimited duration, yes, the proc rate is equal. However, if you let the
swords swing over a fixed duration, the sword with the lower delay is more
likely to proc because it has more chances during that time.
