    The easy way to handle this would be to make it so NPCs can't all stand
on top of one another, hint hint. That's what causes the confusion. As is,
if you want to know which NPC you have targetted you can always look for the
one with the glowing name.

    This seems like a waste. Tap one key and you have the info. If you
really wanted to make it obvious to people, have the name of an NPC show up
in the colour that they would /con to the observer.

    One I'd leave turned off. Last thing I need in combat is a window
popping up in my field of vision or over some important window with Joebob's
tell asking me if I want a group in BoT.

> Help for new players - New characters will start with a bag.

    I agree with this 100%. Starting bag, with your note, food and drink,
and stack of bandages (4 slots) would be ideal. It would teach players the
utility of bags, and show them that bags exist.

    Well, if you have maps that always show the correct direction, I guess
it doesn't make sense to keep it in. Feels a bit like giving the new player
"too much", but I suppose. I just have two questions:

(1) Will older characters that don't have Sense Heading at 200 have their
skill boosted to 200, or will they have to continue to practice SH to cap?
(2) One of the racial advantages of dwarves was a starting Sense Heading
skill of 50. Now that this relative advantage over other races is being
removed, what will be given to dwarves to compensate? My personal suggestion
is that dwarven XP quests like bone chips and Crushbone belts be returned to
their original high-XP status, and that Bloodforge armour be made
rogue-wearable.

    The more they do, the more that feeling will grow. One of the addicting
features of EQ is that there's so many things to master, and mastering each
one is a tiny accomplishment. Take away those little things, and you take
away some of the attachment to the character. "I worked hard to get little
Laygowlass to where he is now!"
