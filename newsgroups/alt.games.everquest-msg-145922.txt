Right during or shortly after a patch I notice there are numerous of these 
questions. Over time it would seem such a question would begin to fade as people 
begin to realize that when a patch occurs there are likely to be troubles logging 
in either to the patch server, the login server, or the game server itself. I 
have noticed, however, that the questions occur with about the same frequency 
after each patch.

What is so difficult to understand involving patches and downtime, especially 
after enough patches for us to know it's to be expected?
