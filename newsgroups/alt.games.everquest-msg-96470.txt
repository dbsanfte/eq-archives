Why in the world would you need to travel all the way
to Velious to get a magical weapon?

All of Velious is dangerous for anyone below level 30.

Instead, go to the auction zone on your server (most
likely East Commonlands, North Freeport, or Greater
Faydark) and just /auction to buy a magic weapon
usable by your race/class.
