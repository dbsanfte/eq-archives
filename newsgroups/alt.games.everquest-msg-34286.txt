Some asshole made an effort to get himself banned by training people,
/shout and /ooc'ing strings of obsceneties, and other such
greif-playing. Guides showed up to talk to him, then the head GM. They
asked him to stop, "froze" him, and summoned him out of the zone.
Never once did the GM "possess" the idiot to walk him out.
