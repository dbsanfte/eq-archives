/agree

If I wanted to play a cleric I'll play a damned cleric. I do not want to 
roll a shaman to find out its really just a cleric.

I might disagree entirely. They need to find a new way to differentiate 
raid gear from single group gear other than just making raid gear 
categorically better. (e.g. like situationally better... that situation 
being a raid setting for example.)

I again disagree entirely. Factors from ability to solo reds vs 
dependancy on groups to engage blues, downtime, expense, gear 
dependancy, are all serious issues pre-65.

Encounter balance = Class balance

They really aren't distinct.

That's a nice dream. In practice its a crock.

Some 55-65s get together yesterday to take out an epic 1.0 mob, they 
engage it and promptly wipe... they didnt factor in its stun, didn't 
allow the tank to generate adequate aggro, and got the casters summoned 
and munched.

Its a challenging fight in its own right.

It was also a fight they could have done if they'd spent some time 
figuring it out. (Hell Ive seen it duo'd by a 65th mage pet with a 
cleric healing it. They had a 64th warrior, 54th cleric, and several 
other 55+ classes present.)

Did they want the challenge? Hell no! They begged some 68ths to help 
kill it... (er... they "helped" the 68ths kill it...er...well... not 
that the 68ths actually needed much help mind you.) And of course they 
were quite proud of themselves when the mob dropped in 20 seconds, 
despite their only real contribution to the fight was that of convincing 
someone else to do it for them.

Where are the players that really want a challenge? I rarely see them. I 
know a few, and I acknowledge that upper end guilds don't have anyone to 
run crying to whenever they get spnaked by a raid mob, but the vast 
majority of players I see from level 1 to 70 avoid being actually 
challenged like it was a toxic plague. (And even those uberguilders 
rarely do anything challenging with their alts... at the drop of the hat 
they drag out their 70th level uber-raider or call in a zerg of 70th 
level friends to deal with any perceived difficulty they are having.

"Can we take the fierce turepta with 6 50ths? Nevermind, I've got a 70th 
level friend coming to 'help' us...." (er kill it while we sit back here 
and watch, after which we can go back to happily grinding regular 
turepta's which never bring the tank below 80%.)

Challenge? No thanks. The only challenge these people want is how to 
maximize their AA/h... and that means getting twink gear, and camping 
easy mobs within sight of zone lines.

I think its even harder because almost nobody is prepared to die except 
against raid targets with their mains. A good balanced encounter should 
be able to kill you.

If you can win without breaking a sweat you don't really deserve much 
XP. (In some games this is actually accounted for, mobs are worth full 
xp the first time you kill them, but after a few dozen, you aren't 
"learning" anything new, and your xp per kill drops off to nothing.

Don't see how TLC applies. He's saying the holy trinity can shread an 
encounter that a rogue, druid, zerker couldn't touch. And he's right.
