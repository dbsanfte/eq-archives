Im not sure exactly what a 53 mage can solo, but try doing the totemic
(shaman armour) quests, you can do all these easily, see
www.interealms.com/shaman for details.
You could go to runneye and pick up blackened iron armour, all of this would
be decent AC at his level and there are a couple of nice items, the black
alloy medallion / belt / coif.
Unrest you can get the thick leather apron from the barkeep, the savant cap
from the reclusive magi (3wis). You could get in a karnors group and go for
rune etched armour (great AC)
depending on what race he is try looking at the deity specific initiate
quests. Gatorscale leggings come from upper guk and you should be able to
get these. Clockworks in Sol A drop the charred guardian shield (9 wis)
You could help him to the testament of vanaeer quest (10 wis) in qeynos and
highpass. There are a couple of good masks from kunark, dont know where they
come from sorry, look into getting either solo or in a group a howling
harpoon, slime coated harpoon or jade chokidai prod. for jewellery giants in
kunark drop forest loops (earrings) or if he is a barb, then get the 4 wis
3AC cultural jewelling ones, for rings get 6 wis rings or 6Ac/65HP rings.
Thata all i could think of given that i dont really know what you can take
with your mage, but it should be a decent starting point at least.
