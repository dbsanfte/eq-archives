Sigh.  I appologize profusely for not considering every single iteration.

But the most important point to the original poster is that one set of CDs
can only be used to establish one account.  Unless you can pry account codes
out of Sony by some other method, you need a second set of CDs to establish
a second account.  LoY notwithstanding, as that one can be downloaded, so
you don't need CDs for LoY.  In any case, Sony is going to get their pound
of flesh for each account you establish, and then get their monthly few
ounces of flesh for each account.

Cheers,
Eric
