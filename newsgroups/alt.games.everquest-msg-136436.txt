Ooh.  Good point.  There's nothing quite so fun like running around and 
around and around and around the pole in the HHK WR (you remember the 
little places, right?) while the casters keep pulling aggro with some 
show-off spell and then shouting GET IT OFF GET IT OFF GET IT OFF!  Or 
the cleric who got aggroed by something the enchie had just started to 
mezz screaming at the rest of us to ignore the mob we were on and grab 
the one that was on him.
