You better believe it.  I made a druid that is level three now.  I do
however have aproblem with the connection.  I am networked with the guy
liveing next to me using a cable modem.  AT&T(Comacast) @home.  I seem to
lose link every 10-30 mins.  I got something setup  where i can release the
ip address then renew it and it seems to solve the problem.  The trouble
with that is I have to quit EQ completely then renew th ip address then i
can play again.  Not bad for lower levels but hwta happend when I'm gettin
whacked at higher levels.  Another problem for me to figure out I guess.
Well  later.  I wanna play eq :)   Oh  if ya wanna know I'm Drad  on the
saryn server.
