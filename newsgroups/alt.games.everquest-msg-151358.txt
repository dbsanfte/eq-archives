I find it much faster to tie it to your RIGHT movement key (or your
LEFT or even both)

Why?  Because I don't hit UP much, travelling any distance its
NUMLOCK and forget it, but I do jockey around a lot going
around trees or rocks or hanging on cliff walls or just doing a gentle
S curving so I can see more of whats off to the sides up ahead.

Not only this, a lot of the time when I'm hanging out or
fighting I'm not moving forward at all, just turning in place to
see whats going on, or moving sideways or back... sure,
I do use UP but not nearly as often as RIGHT/LEFT.
