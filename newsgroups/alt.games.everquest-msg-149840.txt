Well, if you read the EULA more carefully, you would find where Verant
specifically allows for minors to play the game, the account just has to be
owned by their legal guardian.  They don't allow sharing an account, the
minor is expected to play on one account, while the guardian, if he chooses
to play, is expected to play on a different account.  Regardless, Verant
chooses to not allow such language, they own the game, it is their choice to
make.  Adults aren't legally obligated to be able to play the game either.
So long as Verant does not discriminate along any of the lines that are
specifically prohibited, they can pick and choose who gets to play, adult,
child, redheads, tall people, people whose name begins with "J".
