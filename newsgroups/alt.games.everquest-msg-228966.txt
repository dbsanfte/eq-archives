What this tells me is that this was a rushed job.  A Kludgy implementation
implies that not a lot of thought was given to changing this game mechanic
at any level.  They didn't analyze whether it made us overpowered.  They
didn't find the best way (IE the way that always returns the correct amount
of mana to reclaim) to implement it.  And they had no intention of tellng
us.

Further indications that this was a rushed job came after the initial
uproar forced them to justify this change with numbers.  Rytan's numbers
contained factual errors, didn't take into account the active nature of
pet-canni vs. the other classes, and didn't take into account stacking
issues with the mana regen presented.

In fact, I'd wager they gave very little though to this issue until the
uproar on the Tower forced them to respond.

Without that there would have been no paltry increase to our (unstackable)
mana regen line.  There would have been no IRE refund (worthless as
that is).

This was no reasoned change for the better of the game.  It was rushed
and ill thought out.  It has the potential to dramatically unbalance a
class that went through long draughts of popularity already.

Given that it didn't break any encounters, they should have held the change
until they understood the precise nature of the change.
