Interesting. I've had this spell on my "to acquire" list for quite a
while. There was a Call to Corpse spell for sale in bazaar several weeks
back on The Seventh Hammer server, but at 15K there was no way I could
afford it at the time. So are there two different Call to corpse spells,
one that was on test as described and another that went live?
