You missed the point a bit, I think.  Goop on CD + CD in drive = Goop in
drive.  Cleaning the CD after the fact won't help your poor goop-filled
drive.  Cleaning kits don't usually do a whole heck of a lot besides
remove a little dust.  If you keep letting your kids put sticky discs in 
the drive, you'll be replacing a lot of drives...hence the gentle
suggestion that you be proactive in teaching them good habits.

My old CDROM drive would heat up discs nicely too.  I doubt that's your
problem.
