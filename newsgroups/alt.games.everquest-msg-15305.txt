He didn't mean that he actually LOST skill... you are yet another
moron that doesn't understand much.  The simple fact is, he killed the
mob sooner than it would have died... so the dipshit lvl 5 that
started this whole thing got exp in about half the time, so he's now
ahead with the exp, and he can now instantly start working over the
next mob and keep working on his 1HS skill.  This is where the lvl 5
decided to try and think... he's thinking that since the mob is dead,
he just lost 50% of the time to get his skill up, but any normal
person older than 3 can figure out that there are a shit load of other
mobs standing around him that he can work on his 1HS with.
