Does anyone know of a simple and easy site that sort of lists the type of 
spell needed to cure particular spells cast on me or my grp members by Mobs?

Im thinking like,

What cures malo? cure desease, poison or magic?

What cures Tash? is it only AA's RC's or RGC or Cure desease?

What cures Chaos claws?

etc etc

I'm not particularly too bothered about desease counters and the mechanics, 
though any simple explanation would be welcome.

No, I'm just wondering if there is a definitive list of what cures what?

Thanks in advance.
