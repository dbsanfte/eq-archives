I was keeping a list of dodgy names, waiting for this thread to come up but
I have since lost it. the ones I remember are;

Gism
Waltzing Matilda ( a very helpful wizard who helped my druid retrieve a
corpse, when I lost a level and went back to 18)
Illtakethat (a Rogue.... actually my Rogue, I wasn't intending to play him
for very long, but he levelled really quickly)


Taras Bulba
