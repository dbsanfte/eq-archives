i started to reply to your post up there but it was kind of long so i
cancelled what I wrote...
I have both games as well, and I play them both on and off, but played EQ
all the time unless I had my AC account active (about 6 months)
I enjoyed AC, being a good break from EQ, but after a month or 2, it would
get bland, same thing over and over and it was hard to keep in touch with
people, and remember where all the portals were (I had the AC track program
up all the time but it was still hard to get around). I loved the landscape
but it just was so bland.
About EQ.... I have over 4 months play time in it, and its been 3 years in
March. I havent been playing EQ much for the past year, its been on and off,
I just want some RL friends to play every now and then (which is why I
usually only play Counter-Strike now). I got my best bud to 29, we're
talking about activating the accounts again but im not sure... anyways, I
have a good time in it, I've explored most of everything except Luclin, and
I still have fun... I just lost interest. Its still some fun to go back and
chat now, and it holds the record for longest interest with me. I wouldnt
mind playing again but I just cant find time anymore.
My final opinion: 1) pick which friend you like more. 2) pick the game you
like more. 3) leave them and join me in Counter-Strike.

PS ADIDAS is better than Nike.
