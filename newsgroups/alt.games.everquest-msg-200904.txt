Nah, it's been my experience that you report them for posting off topic in a
newsgroup and their ISP at the very least, warns them to stop.  It really is
pretty obvious in a group devoted to a game that gets commercial offers
posted, so an ISP will come down pretty hard on the abuser. Any advertising
in this NG would be spam, regardless of whether it's 'free' or not.
