    Eeep, so weight is about capped. That changes things! I'd suggest moving
to a Reinforced Acrylia Mantle, a Shimmering Terror Hide Cloak, and another
Electrum Black Sapphire earring from the Cougar Claw. That should be fairly
weight-neutral and come in under 2 K while upping HPs by nearly 100. What
are you carrying in inventory that weighs in at 7 pounds? Might be better to
put off the gear upgrade and go for something like a Rallic Pack, which
would buy you the weight to be able to move to weapons like an SoS.
