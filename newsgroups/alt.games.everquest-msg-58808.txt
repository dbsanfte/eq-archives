I would include this caveat to twinking:  It can have similar effects as
Powerleveling.  My main did the Ghoulbane quest just to do it;  I wound up
with a 34th level Warrior with a GB.  I figure 'Why not start a paladin to
get some use out of it?' so I do.  Give him some armor I have lying around,
the GB, a Deathwatch Sword, and set out for GFAY, just outside of Felwithe.
    By 5th level he had a Defense of 8, Offense of 9, 2HS of 4, Bash of 5,
and 1HS of 12. Basically nothing could stand against me for long, died too
quick, and I didn't have enough time in combat to raise my combat skills.
After 5th the newbie criiters no longer gave XP, and I didn't have the skill
to effectively fight those oh-so-numerous Crushbone orcs.
