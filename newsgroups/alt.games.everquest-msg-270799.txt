Well I find the Qeynos suburbs to be pretty samey, in some cases even 
having almost the same layout to the zone, however my problem lies more 
in the fact that they are suburbs of Qeynos. I enjoyed having them as 
seperate towns of their own in EQLive, simply because they were greatly 
spread out, it gave some variety to the landscapes and towns to navigate 
to and through, and all the races felt individual, being in different 
parts of Antonica to the main city.

For me, the cities added to the diversification I already mentioned, not 
only in their style but in their physical seperation as well.

It would be nice to have some company playing EQLive...I tend to steer 
clear of it now as it's a fairly lonely game where my character is hunting.
