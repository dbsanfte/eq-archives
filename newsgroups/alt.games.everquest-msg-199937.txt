Ah found where absor said that lame excuse about 
paineel vendors maybe being wise in their dealings,
rather than stating if it was a bug or not (I'm still
betting bug, as early as this zone was around before
the warrens)

http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3322

"BUG LIST 3/22/2001"


"1. Paineel Vendors don't show items that you sell to them. (They may
be aware of this.) "


"Maybe they really like that stuff and they're keeping it. Or maybe
they know of places where they can make more money selling them"


Sure, yeah, lets just blow the question off.


AHAHA this is in there too.. which they just fixed I guess:

"7. Losing all your buffs because you had fewer hitpoints than given
to you via hitpoint gear. The system thinks you didn't have any
hitpoints. (Change the system to check for hitpoint gear before
checking for how many hitpoints you have, and THEN calculate whether
you zoned while dying.)" 

"From what I hear about this one, if we fix it you're more likely to
come out on the other side dead. Essentially the bug is preventing
death while zoning, fixing it would be a nerf, actually. Or at least
that's how I understand itï¿½"


Until 2 years later, anyway.
