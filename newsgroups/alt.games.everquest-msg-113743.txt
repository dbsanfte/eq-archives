If you look in the folder the EQ is installed in there are two files that
have your character name on them.  It will be your name and some number and
then two extensions.  Copy any and all of these to somewhere else to back
them up and then when you reinstall them copy them to the drive/folder you
place EQ in.  This will take care of all your keyboard and hot button
settings.  Other than that it seems like everything else is set up on the
server.  Good luck.

Oddly I did a reinstall and prior had like 13 games installed on my
computer.  This time I installed EQ and decided to install the other ones
when I got up the wild hair to want to play them.  Three months now, and EQ
is still the ONLY game I have installed.  Go figure.
