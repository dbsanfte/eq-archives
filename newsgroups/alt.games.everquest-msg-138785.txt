Well, by first-year, I mean I'm going into CS in the fall ;)

But from what I can tell, and what I gather from talking to people who just
graduated from Alberta's CS program, a lot of it focuses on C, Java, etc.
Pretty much anything that's 'mainstream' in today's industry. A lot of it is
general information, that can be applied to any language, but some of it is
specific, and it covers those languages.
