I would agree with this reasoning. NPC's didn't used to be able
to zone, however now they can I'm guessing it'd be easier to
allow pets to zone too. They probably won't change things though,
on the back of there being a lot more issues on their hit list to
change, and the after-the-fact rationalizations they've come up
with since.
