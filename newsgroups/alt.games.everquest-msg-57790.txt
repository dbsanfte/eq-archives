On Xegony (where my alt is a common jewelcrafter selling many nights in
gfay):

= Velium Jasper Ring - 450pp each 900pp pair
= Platinum Jasper Ring - 175pp each 325pp pair
= Braided Ivy Cords - 300-400pp  (depends on just how many are, errm,
acquired since the zone to get them is just one zone away from our
marketplace, aka. faymart)
= Chipped Bone Bracelet - 200pp (and still going down fast)
= Bone Mask of the Jarsath - 4k (just saw two for 4k two nights ago, decent
for CLR and anything else I would suppose...too bad it doesnt have INT as
well or in place of WIS)  (wishful thinking of my chanter speaking I
suppose)
