If this ever did work, I don't believe it does now.

I first started working up my Beg skill (just for something to do,
mainly) about two months ago.  I put a few practice points into it,
then sat and begged from the Canoe near the Hadden spawn site when
I was camping for the Fishbone Earring.  I begged from that Canoe
for HOURS, and while it did seem to accept my attempt (I didn't
get the "you can't beg from that" message, I got the usual
"your attempt at begging has failed" message), I got ZERO skill
increases.  And that's after HUNDREDS of attempts.

Then I moved ten feet over and tried begging from the NPC
that stands in the shack by the campfire, and got 3 skill increases
in 14 attempts at begging.

I don't think begging from boats increases your skill anymore,
if indeed it ever did.
