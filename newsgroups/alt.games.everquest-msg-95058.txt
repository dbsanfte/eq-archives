I guess he's not in the world, he's on the moon.

I started a Vah Shir Beastmaster to play together with the one my son has.
I am currently doing the Quest of the Khati Sha Recruit.  Allakhazam tells
me I need to find the NPC Kagazz.

     http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1488

I can't find him.  Here's what you'd see at the above link.

     To get the fasteners, ask Kagazz about "Forged
     Fasteners" (he is behind the armoury by the forge).

I found a couple forges, but there was no Kagazz nearby.  I found what I'd
say is the armoury, but again no Kagazz.

Thank you in advance if you have a tip for me.
