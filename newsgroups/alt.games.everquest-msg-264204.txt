Been reading up - I'm now very, very excited.            :)

Crafting sounds excellent (and involved - apparently, you can 'ally'
yourself with a shop, and get quests from them to make specific items.
As you complete these quests, your status with them improves, leading
to new recipes, and access to their private crafting area, in the back
of the shop.  Can anyone in beta confirm this is in ?)

It also looks like Guilds can be a lot of fun, with various quests
that can be performed for the city, and reqarded with special 'Guild
XP' which can then be spent of perks for you Guild.

I really hope this is out in Nov.  Even if it's' a typical MMORPG
launch, it still sounds like there'll be  alot to keep us busy while
things are worked on.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
