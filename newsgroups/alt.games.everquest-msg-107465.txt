On Wed, 17 Apr 2002 05:58:04 GMT, Lance Berg <emporer@dejazzd.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>This goes double if I don't have LFG on.

If you think that is bad... a couple weeks ago some guy I had never
seen before invite me to *guild*. Without a word. From his actions I'd
say he was inviting every single person he saw unguilded. He proceeded
to do it again about a week later.

Very annoying.

I know I can turn that off, but I never expected to actually have to.

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
