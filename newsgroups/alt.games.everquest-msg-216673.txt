/agree. Game husband and i were in a raid with our ex guild, and the 
cleric assigned to his group was so tweaked up about winning her roll 
and playing with her new legs that he was at 15% health and getting beat 
on in Kael arena....I popped him a heal and sent her a tell asking her 
why she hadnt followed raid instructions and healed him at 50 on a pull 
and she said that he just hit 50 and she was healing him...so i 
explained it was because i had just popped a fast heal on him and he was 
STILL  getting pounded by an add he was slowing that was resisting. She 
bitched me out asking why I was watching him instead of my group [a 
bunch of robes and an SK] when I explained that i normally kept him 
targeted on a pull because my group werent involved until the mob was 
acquired my the MT and assist tank and i *could* see their health on my 
screen. shortly after I complained to the raid leader, who was in hubbys 
group, we switched groups.He ahd apparently also been wondering when she 
was going to heal him. Her group was the only group to lose anybody that 
evening. Feh, 5 levels higher than me and epiced=\

Raid leader promised that he would never make her the healer for an 
important group in a raid ever again. She deguilded after that for a 
more raid oriented guild, and she got deguilded by them after several 
raids in a row got messed up by her inability to focus or be in a CH 
chain. She is back in a family guild...raid guilds require 'too much 
attention when I want to socialize'
