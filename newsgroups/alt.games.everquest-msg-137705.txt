And for even most Kunark level encounters, battle rezzing isn't
even still a viable tactic...is it?

I'm sorry, but I can see how a guild could try "throw 100 monks
at Trak."  Zerging IS a viable, though cheesy tactic.  If your sole
goal is loot, and you can kill an end game mob by chunking
50 level 60's at it and losing 38 of 'em, more power to you: You
accomplished your goal (think "Chineese Infantry" ;-)  ) and
can now upgrade.

What I can't see is (as somebody else posted) 50 level 60 folks
de-leveling for any loot.  Seriously.  A rez'd character is just
so gimpy it's not worth it.  And mobs that could kill 50 level 60
folks (yes, still lots and lots of those) are going to really have
fun with 50 gimped melee/oom casters.

Cleric sticks are good for getting people back after a Total Wipe.
They're not going to get you going again on the same attempt,
because most end-game mobs are going to do something that
will just eat the gimped, newly-rez'd characters alive (not to mention
targeting that epic cleric sometime, too...after all, he's still around
or we wouldn't be thinking of this tactic).  Re-group, re-buff, try
again.  The epic cleric saved you 30 minutes of his med, rez, med
rez, med, rez, etc cycle.  That's it.
