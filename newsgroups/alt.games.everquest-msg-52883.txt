    Yup. Assuming I could find anyone there who isn't in an epic raid.
Server-specific, I know, but that place is dead.

    If we get wiped out, the cleric will help us (and there's usually one at
zone if ours LDs or something) only once we have the bodies out. I'm a
rogue - I AM the way the bodies get out. We could get lucky and have a
nearby camp pull bodies to their camp and res our cleric in, but I don't
plan to see aid - I plan to have to do it alone. And that means me running
back.

>Are you afraid to fight in Chardok and Siren's Grotto too?

    Only raided in Chardok with the main, only passed through Siren's with
the main. Chardok is changing into a pickup zone, but Siren's is still
BYOG - and since I HAVE no ready-made group, that means I don't go to
Siren's.

>Maybe this is why people whine that there's noplace to fight.

    Yup. If you run 10-15 minutes to get someplace (you know, some of us
don't have Selo's like you do), and zone in to find it empty, you generally
don't go back.

    What mob could you gimp-rush in this manner that isn't already killable
by gimp-rushing with wizards and clerics? How much of a tide-turning effect
do you expect from unbuffed tanks running back into battle - or do you have
folks at these battles whose job would be to rebuff dead folks, instead of
having other people there who could do something useful? I can remember one
poor guild whose leader convinced them that one of the big Kael mobs (well,
when Vindicator and Statue were "big", anyways) could be bind-rushed. Ouch.
