i decided to get DC

i used it once

the only thing that i did not know was that it had a cast time....which, i
suppose, shouldn't affect me too much

so far i charmed a giant in kael....it was surprisingly comfortable, like
being a mage, execpt i didn't need to heal the pet

i looted a silk hat and had 1 plate bracer drop, but couldn't loot
it....yay...haven't been to kael in a year and i *still* have no use for
that armor

i'll try it out in valor/thunder and see how it goes
