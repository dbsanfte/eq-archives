	You mean the level 61 (2? whatever) one?  It's like 500 points
less base which is like 800 less after foci etc.  That really is enough
to matter in these situations.  

	HOT won't begin to keep up with an unslowed named at this level.
What I typically see is something like 'Whoops!  Add Nasty Noobeater!"
then me chain casting PR until someone gets the thing slowed and I can
do my usual HOT/Cheal routine.

	No one uses the 61 spell after they get PR, I mean, I've seen 
raids done using nothing but PR on the MT...
