One is an AC/hp buff, one is a straight hps buff, and one is a
straight AC buff.

Go back and read my post:  As far as *hp buffs* are concerned, there's
only two lines that stack.  Resolution and Symbol.

For stragith up *AC buffs*, again, only two lines stack, Resolution
and Armor of Faith (or Shield of Words).

Going with your cleric friend being level 49, he would have Resolution
(about 250hps), and Symbol of Naltron (520 if my memory is correct).
With a base of 2050 (which is really low for a level 51 troll
warrior), that's about 2850ish hps.  Sufficient to be using complete
heals.

Actually, you have that backwards.
Against fast/hard hitting mobs, complete heal take *too long* to heal
the warrior.  That's why against mobs that quad for 700+, the first of
the complete heal chain has to start BEFORE the mob even engages the
warrior--you thought aggro control was hard with Slate?!?

Against, slow/weaker hitting mobs (typically exp grind mobs), complete
heal is much more effective.  It gives the warrior a chance to build
up aggro before the healer even shows up on the hate list and it makes
the heal/mana effeciency completely screwed in favor of the spell.
