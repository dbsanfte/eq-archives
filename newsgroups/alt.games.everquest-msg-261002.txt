Haven't seen this discussed here yet, and this group tends to have some
good thoughts.  The trading system in EQ2 is somewhat new, or rather, a
new spin on old ideas.

First off, they ditched offline vending.  This is something that has been
very popular in other games, because no one has to run around hawking
their items or leaving their computer up all night.  But Moorgard
countered this by saying that allowing folks to sell 24/7 would saturate
the market too quickly. They want a game where folks first reaction to
getting better gear isn't "let's go shopping!" but "let's go
adventuring!".

Anyhow, here's how it works. There are two ways to sell your stuff:

1) Run around hawking your wares. :)  Pretty standard stuff.
2) You put yourself into Vendor Mode in *your own home*.  You then choose
a market which you wish your items to be listed in (Freeport, Qeynos, or
Blackmarket), and your items will show up on an NPC vendor.  Folks
browsing the vendor, who see what you have to sell, can choose to either
get directions from the NPC to your house, where they can go buy it from
you, or they can pay a fee to the NPC to "have it shipped" to them right
there. (Ok, the shipping is my own fanwank, but honestly it makes
sense...if you want goods brought to you, you usually pay both shipping
and something to the guy who got it from the supplier.)

So basically you can still search through all the stuff being sold (ala
Bazaar), but you are encouraged to actually visit someone's home if you
are watching your bank account.  It also encourages folks to take an
interest in the appearance of their apartment.

There was also some comment about people being able to combine their
vendoring with their friends. So we could all go over to Bob P.'s pad and
set up a little mini flea market together. :)
