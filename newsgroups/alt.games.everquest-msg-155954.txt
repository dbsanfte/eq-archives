Felt much shorter, but you're probably right.

Exactly. Pointless using on MT, though I did manage to suck 2k damage
from a monk on Emp with his autoriposte finished ):oD

Message:
You cannot use the /shield ability if either party is under the effects
of a discipline
(or something to that effect)

Ah... that makes sense, and I can see a viable use for it then. SK or
Ranger MT with a /shield rotation for low agro holding fights, Non
defensive MT with a /shield rotation on the 1860 quadding Sol Ro, etc.

Gotta see some parses to see whether that'd work, but I imagine it
doesn't reduce enough damage taken to actually buy very much time in
it's basic state.
