Mandela is a lot of things, but in this one particular thing he's
right. Bush's bloodlust is a major threat to world peace. So are
terrorists and Iraq, not saying they aren't, but Bush is nearly as
dangerous.

You don't want to attack Iraq without at least tacit consent from the
world. Didn't you learn anything from a year ago? The US isn't
invincible. Thumping Iraq now will make American life so much more
miserable you can't even dream of how much it will suck, and thats
assuming the US wnis easily!

Ironically, that could be applied to the US as well. A friend of mine
calls the dispute with Iraq dealing with "weapons of mass distraction"
- a convenient sword of damocles to keep over the American public's
head to keep them from noticing the US itself isn't in the hottest
shape these days.

The 'strength of American capitalism' is a disgrace that just hasn't
boiled over yet. Multinationals (generally American based, but not
always) are responsible for a great deal of disgusting actions around
the world.

Unbridled capitalism just hasn't yet gotten its comeuppance. Its time
is coming.

Your pride in your country's economic view is admirable but
unrealistic.


>and for being unafraid to make clear just how irrelevant and

When you have countries who try to hamstring it at every opportunity
its hard to live up to your expectations.

I recommend you look at the only country in the world that didn't want
its soldiers to be responsible to a world court for war atrocities.
Can you guess which one?
