Well Sean, I checked out that thread, and what I got from it is
that the NWN devs must be so impressed by the EQ devs more storied
exploits (the hybrid exp penalty, the claim that Alchemy was not
broken, and the Moss Covered Twig, to name just three) that they're
determined to outdo them in documented foolishness.

My favorite is the claim that UMD is only unbalanced if there're a
lot of scrolls lying around.  If there're scrolls available to be
bought, even in a server vault campaign, then any Rogue with half
a brain is gonna have as many as he wants.  I found that by making
a 50-50 Rogue/Fighter it was easy to have maxed out "technical"
skills (Search, Disarm Traps, & Pick Locks) on a character who
could fight very well (Scale with an 18 DEX is nearly as good as
Full Plate).  The fighting part is nice, but the magic is in the
Search plus Disarm Traps (remember you can keep them maxxed while
still using half your levels on any other class), which allows you
to recover and then sell traps (easiest way to raise lots of cash
I've found in the game).  An NWN module/campaign without tough
traps takes away a lot of the utility of the Rogue, and one with
the traps allows the Rogue to be as wealthy as he cares to make
himself.  Wealth plus UMD gives incredible power in the game,
totally unmatchable by those without.  But hey, "it's not broken,
it's working as intended, at most it needs a small tweak".
