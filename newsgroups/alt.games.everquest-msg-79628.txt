Hi guys.  I was wondering if any of you have this problem.  I load up
everquest and start getting into the game.  There's this little mouse icon
that stays right in the middle of the screen.  its one of those low res
white one from Windows.  It always stays there and appears right when I get
to the character select screen.  Any idea how to get rid of it?
