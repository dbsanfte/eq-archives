In case you didn't notice, nobody uses the DDR nomenclature, because the
marketing people like the big numbers achieved by using the transfer rates,
which is silly considering that it was not all that long ago that things
were switched from using the ns rating to the MHz rating for speed. It just
clutters the market when there are only two people who buy RAM anyway, the
'normal user' who jsut wants the thing to work, and the 'power user' who
isn't going to be fooled by the big number of the transfer ratings. The
whole marketing mindset is just ridiculous.
