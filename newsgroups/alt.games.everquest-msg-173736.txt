Definitely not soloable.  Too many mobs with very high MR.

SMR and Ink of the Dark are highly soloable, of course.  Thracken is not.

The Test of Charm pretty much is soloable, and all the ground spawns are
easy to get solo (need wiz to port to Sky).

Tangrin- nope
Drozlin- nope
Verina- nope
Shissar- nope
Vampire essence- doubt it very much
Chardok Prince- nope
Cazel- nope (though soloable by a 60+ necro)
Kindle- no idea.

Most, if not all, of those are one-groupable though, if it's a very good
group.
