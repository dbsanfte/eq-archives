A lot of RP-oriented players seem to have a real issue with using
gear that wasn't looted from some poor mob they've persoanlly
helped to slaughter.  Frankly, I just don't get it.  Fantasy
fiction is full of gear taken from the armory when the orcs are
at the gates, or scavenged from somebody else's kill, or bought
for a song at a flea market, or otherwise acquired without any
demonstrated "merit".  WTF difference does it make where your
sword or hat came from?  Are you defined by your gear and its
origin?  How absurd!  My characters are who they are, not what
they wear.  Yes, it most certainly is neat to get a usable piece
of gear as the result of an epic battle or quest.  Does that mean
that all 20 of your gear slots must be filled with the reeking
remains of mobs that you personally sent on to a better life?
Why?  What is this RP justification you imply?  WTH is wrong with
Skeeve going to the Bazaar and buying himself a new toy?  How is
that not RP?  (answer: it is intrinsicly neither more nor less rp
than anything else not explicitly out-of-character).
