I dont have a problem at all with the system. It's just debt and can be made 
back easily enough.

Saying that though i'm not the type of player who simply power levels 
through the game. I like to take my time and explore, do quests etc.

I came across one group yesterday who had been killing scarecrows for 10 
hours straight! I asked why and they simply said it was great exp. To each 
their own but for me thats not playing the game it's just watching numbers 
go up.
