Raiding is the same as grouping, just with bigger numbers.  A group of
people bands together to accomplish something that a single 6-man group
couldn't accomplish by itself.

That "group" can be 10 people, or 100.  Usually there are more
organizational factors, such as a pre-defined loot distribution plan, etc. 
Though I have seen raids where the word "organization" never entered into my
mind.   =)
