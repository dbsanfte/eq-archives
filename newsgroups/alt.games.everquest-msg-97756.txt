Joe thanks for these utilities.

I am curious if any one has a method of stripping out tracking messages.
My logs are Huge from a highland lion is ahead. behind. to the left to the
right.

Any ideas to macro a program to do a search and destroy ?
Is this possible in word ? I can search but deleting one line at a time is
brutal

Thanks
Don
