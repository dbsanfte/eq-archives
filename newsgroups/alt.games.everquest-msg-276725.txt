B) - You are misinterpreting my post as misinterpretation of yours. We 
*are* in agreement. I posted to expand upon what you said not debate it.

Its a balancing act... but if you don't like Santa GMs what do you think 
of the bazaar... where the 70th level ultra rich dump their garbage on 
you... garbage that's still 50 levels out of your reach.

No self respecting GM would let you walk into town and purchase loot 
that drops of monsters that dragons couldn't touch at a price you can 
afford after only few hours squishing bugs that can't touch you...
