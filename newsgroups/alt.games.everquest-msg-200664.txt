I made sure I meleed where possible (and appropriate of course) to max
out my defense - remember you are a plate class - you WILL have to
dive into combat and grab bodies or assist dress-wearing party
members. Sure you can't taunt or deal out much damage (my lvl 54 pet
does 2-3x more melee damage than me), but you WILL get hit, so work
that defense and bash.

At level 54, I have long since maxed defense/offense and 1hb. I am
working slowly up through Bash and 2hb. I have 2850hps and 1070ac self
buffed and 233wis naturally without kei.
