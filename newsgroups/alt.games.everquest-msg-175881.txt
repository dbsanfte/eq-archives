This problem seems to happen after you have been through several zones
including PoP zones, and Bazaar.  The more times you have zoned the
more likely it is to occur.  You can test this by logging into Nexus
in the early evening when its crowded.  Spin a 360 at the base of the
pyramid.  If you've just started the game in that zone it should be
pretty smooth.  Now go into bazaar, back to PoK and zone into and out
of PoN and PoD just for the heck of it.  Now go back to Nexus and try
it again.  You will notice a very definate "hitch" as you spin by the
direction of the characters at the top of the pyramid.  If you leave
the game (have to go all the way to the desktop so you are out of
DirectX) and come back it's fine again.  

They must somehow be caching graphic objects from the various zones in
the video card memory and after enough objects get there things start
to slow down.  One way to help yourself is once you have gotten to the
zone you are going to camp, log completely out of the game and come
back so that zone is the only one for which the video card is caching
graphics objectes.
