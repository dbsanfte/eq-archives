I agree, Fear is quite usable as is, I was certainly overstating the case a bit.

What I was trying to do, though, was to explain how a stacking fear could be a good
thing.

Once upon a time, snare didn't stack with root.  It might have seemed similarly silly
to thing that it WOULD stack; I mean, root is stationary and snare is merely slowed
down.  But even a root/rot combat is worlds easier now that you can have a snared and
rooted mob, so that when one wears off the other is still present.

Whether you want that with fear is certainly questionable, I have been known to
deliberately use lower level fears in order to get more frequent breaks in order to
keep dragging targets back away from trouble.  On the other hand, there are times
(soloing cobalt drakes come to mind) when I'd have paid dearly for a bombproof fear,
which is what a stackable version would provide.  Fortunately, as a cleric I did have
access to that combination, in a way, using Blinding Luminescence... but thats not
useful unless you are using fear/nuke.
