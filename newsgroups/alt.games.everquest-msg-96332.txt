As someone mentioned in another post, EQ is constantly doing calculations
to provide motion.  This is true with any game.  When you look at things
like Word, IE, and such...  Their processes do not take up that much, due
to the fact that they were not calculatng anything to put up a new piece of
text.  It does refresh a window with every minute change that is presented,
however, the changes are also minute.

In games with 3D modeling, such as Quake, Everquest and such, you are
refreshing every frame, that is 15 to 30+ frames per second, depending on
your system.  There are also other factors to consider.  Lighting, for one.
If you look at something in real life, you will notice that faces, curved
objects, all have highlights and shadows.  3D games are currently trying to
capture that 'realism' for immersion effect.  When you look at what Quake
was and what Quake is now.  you will notice that Quake, back in the good
old days, looks rather pixelated and blocky.  When you look at the current
quake models, you notice they are more rounded, solid looking.

Also, you notice when playing a game...  As more 'people' or 'objects' are
in motion, the slower a system gets.  This is due to the fact that the
computer is now trying calculate everything in your current view,
drawing/refreshing that view with the new calculations.  In an action game,
it also is tracking particles in motion or effects.  Even the simple
actions you are refering to are doing the following:

1) Sending information from your system to the server that you are carrying
out a series of actions
2) Receiving data that the server has received the data you are sending,
and the results of said actions
3) Calculating and refreshing your view at 15 to 30 frames per second, to
give you a sense of full motion in view.
4) Polling for specific key requests, such as 1-0 for the hot keys, or the
arrows for direction.

This is all happening at once.  Now mind you, the program itself is
actually refreshing as quickly as it can... It won't limit itself to 15 to
30 frames per second, it would probably do it a lot faster.  But as more
data is being process, the frame rate drops as it starts to try and handle
more information.  One of the key things you should look at the lag meter,
the 4 number with the scrolling bar.  The first number is your ping.  The 2
%s are the Packet Loss to Server, and Packet Loss from server.  The last
number is the amount of data your client is receiving.  As it gets larger,
the more likely your system will be taxed to try and keep up.  In large
raids, you will often times see it in the thousands, because your client is
trying to keep track of several players, player states, particle effects,
NPC states, the reports of damage and spells used.

Now, given the new graphic engine...  It is using more curved surfaces,
which will require more calculations, a drop in frame rate due to the
calculations and how it will handle it.  The new models are memory and
processor intensive due to the fact it is using more polygons to give it a
more realistic effect.

Check up sometime, the background information on Final Fantasy movie.  Find
out how much time it took to render the stuff they do for that movie.
Current games are trying to head for that at an interactive level, so be
aware, that the stuff they are doing is on a system and OS that is higher
than what most homes have.
