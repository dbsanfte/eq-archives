Pet peeve: While practically everyone calls him "Starshine"
(even an awful lot of the EQ websites) his actual surname
is "Starsine", no "h".

I've seen him in person, and by god it's "Starsine".

Similarly, damned near everyone (including the pinnacle of
Bard-dom, eqdiva.com) lists the level 7 Bard song as
"Jonathan's Whistling Warsong", when in fact it's
actually "Jonthan's".
