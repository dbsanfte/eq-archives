Yes some stating places are definitely busier than others.
Sadly it varies from server to server and depends largely on what s in
vogue at the time (i.e. Frogloks)

Gfay is also usually busy at certain times (weekends) generally.

Qeynos, on the other hand is one of the quieter starter zones.

My favorite statring zones are Halas and Shar Vahl, they are IMHO the
best starter zones, but that could be my subjective bias.
