I know a re-format isn't nessesary, I don't lose anything by formating, all
my important info is burned to CDs and all my programs are owned, and I have
CDs. plus installed on other partitions, so re-formating only takes as long
as it takes re-install windows.  I may play with it a little but in the past
I have had much more luck with video cards just formating.. Anyway I got a
few days till my card gets here. I didn't spend to much on it. and now will
save a little for the G4 6400 Ti, and put it in a NEW system with a GOOD
card...
