Specifies a format for Reply address with lokari's fits.

Doesn't say anything about munging the address.

Oh, and RFCs,  Guidelines, not laws.

learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
