Oh yeah, that'd go over well.  It'd be like getting on a bus to
go to work and finding that the bus routes have changed without
anyone telling you.

If I had a character who's figured out who in his town sells a
useful ingredient, and then went back to buy some and found the
NPC gone, I'd get fed up pretty quick.

It's actually a very hard problem to solve, trying to keep old
content fresh while not screwing over people who are depending on
it staying the same.

Frankly, I think part of the problem is that people get into ruts.
Crushbone and Paludal feel old and repetitious, but everyone still
goes there to level their alts.  Why not go find some level-
appropriate zones that you haven't done to death, and level up
there instead?  There's an amazing amount of content already in
the game, and I'll bet that many players (myself included) have
seen only a fraction of the stuff available at many levels.
