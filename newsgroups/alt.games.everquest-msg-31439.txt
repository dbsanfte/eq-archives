Well there were lessons to be learned and apparently you didn't (or
can't or won't). Unless you have a RF friend to mentor you, forget EQ.
You don't have the patience to play EQ let alone learn it, nor is a
stranger going to help someone who wants everything "now". Not a
flame--just my honest opinion.
