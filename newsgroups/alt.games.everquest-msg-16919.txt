Class beliefs?  So druids should make sure that all animals live, and none
die?  What about natural selection, culling, etc?  Also, I wonder where EQ
got the idea that Druids were in tune with the animals.  That is Shamanism.
Druids were in tune with the land and plants, not animals.

Who says fairies are "good" ?  Paladins are the warrior clerics.  If the
fairies follow another god, any fanatic would say they need to be
slaughtered.  For example, look at what the crusades were.  Those were the
religious fanatics going off to battle based off their belief.  The nicer
fantasy version is Paladins.  Also being nicer, and friendlier, the paladins
get to kill inhuman heretics in the guise of fairies, and not human
Moors.... well, there is that guard in Freeport I think I heard the paladins
get to slaughter..... humm....  Still, that does not defeat the fanatic vs.
heretic aspect to religious warriors.
