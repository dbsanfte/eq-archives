Get the same thing in East Freport and looking at the castle from the Wall
in crushbone. I've still got a 16mb so that explains it a little. Yet a
friend of mine was using an 8mb 125 ram, went to 32mb 512 ram, with not that
much difference. Weird.

I don't really understand the clip plane. It doesn't seem to make any
diffenrence to what your pc has to draw in evrytime u look around. Thus in
EP with it on full and on zilch, it still drags horrendously. If it did
affect that we'd all be laughing wouldn't we?

Cheers

Kev
