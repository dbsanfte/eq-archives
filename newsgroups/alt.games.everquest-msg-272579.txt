    Simple question, really. If you found an exploit in EQ (or, for the EQ2 
players, EQ2), what would you do?

    For me, the question isn't academic. Last night I found a repeatable 
quest which yields between 1750 and 3500 pp per hour, which involves no risk 
whatsoever and can be done by a brand new level 1 character. This is a 
Yantis exploit waiting to happen. At first I hadn't considered the cash 
aspect, and helped a few guildmates get the quest reward quickly. Then, out 
of curiosity, I went to a vendor and tried to sell the quest item - over 100 
pp for an item that took under 2 minutes to get (and I hadn't bound at one 
quest NPC or done any other tricks to speed things up). Yikes. I went to 
chat, found what server had a GM online, went to that server and created a 
level 1 character, sent a direct tell to the GM, and demonstrated for him 
how quickly I could rack up the cash. He sent me back to chat, he talked 
with the devs, aaaand... they asked me to file a bug report. It took two bug 
reports to give a complete description of the issue - hopefully the devs put 
the two together to get the full picture. And hopefully they do this 
quickly, before the bots start racking up 80 K a day.
