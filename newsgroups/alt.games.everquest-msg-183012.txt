One thing to remember when figuring out how loot will work. When someone
says "If you are already asking how loot works, you obviously are here for
the wrong reasons" then leave. That translates into "I will get all the loot
and distribute how I see fit after, I don't care what you think." Especially
in pickup groups.
I got this when asking at a pickup Naggy raid, they said that and about half
the people left, and they failed.....
