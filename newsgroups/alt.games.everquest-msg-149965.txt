Note:
If you get feared by Lady Vox you can steer yourself into a wall and use the
left and right movement keys to keep yourself in position until the fear
wears off.  Often times you may get nuked if you are still in the her aggro
range but at least you won't pull surrounding mobs while you are out
sightseeing.
