And hard to draw any conclusions from it too.

Yeah making skills and ways to use them sounds a little premature. We 
should be at the fine tuning percentages/stats/drop rates stage, not 
"inventing mechanics" stage.

No. Never. SOE hasn't even heard of them.

Indeed.

Then again... do you really want someone logging onto a website and 
pulling up your 'automatic included SOE endorsed magelo like' profile 
before they invite you to group? Depends exactly what all it does, how 
much control the players have over it, and whether or not it ends up 
being a paid for value add.

Yeah... adding traps to the game in a patch is not -fixxing bugs-, its 
probably creating them.
