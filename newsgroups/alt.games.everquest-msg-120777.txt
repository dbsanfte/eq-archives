All of the Focus Items work "when they feel like it"
My Druid was getting messages like "your Dustcryers Crystal Ball sparkles"
when it did work, but not for every spell that would check against it.

But more than one item can work on the same spell...

[Wed Jun 05 18:13:00 2002] Your Braided Ivy Cords shimmers briefly.
[Wed Jun 05 18:13:00 2002] You begin casting Spirit of Wolf.
[Wed Jun 05 18:13:03 2002] You feel the spirit of wolf enter you.
[Wed Jun 05 18:13:03 2002] Your Platinum Armband flickers with a pale light.

Braided Ivy Cords - Enhancetment Haste I
Platinum Armband - Mana Preservation I

I was wearing GE Boots (Enhancement Haste II) at the time... but either the
spell only checks one item effect per cast, or it checked and failed.
I've also still got a Lockjaw Vest (Extended Enhancement I) in the bank...
I'll have to see if that stacks as well
