That used to be the case.
It wasn't that GH had more aggro, it was because you had to cast GH
*MORE OFTEN* (keep this fact in your mind) to come even remotely close
to healing someone.

The game engine counts *FREQUENCY* of heals or attacks more critically
than the actual impact.

And I can show you just how easily you can sustain aggro even when
someone is casting high taunt spells.

Look, there's nothing with higher taunt as far as a spell is concerned
than an enchanter's debuff.  Enchanter spells are specifically coded
to generate an obscene amount of aggro (go dig up the reference by GZ,
the original spell designer for EQ, about 2 years back).  However,
even an enchanter can debuff a mob to hell and back and NOT be aggroed
if the warrior is on his game.

Taunt isn't something that "builds" up.
If you successfully taunt something, you immedately go to the top of
the hate list.  It doesn't matter if you've not touched the mob at
all, you can stand right next to it, and press TAUNT.  If that
succeeds, you're number one on the hit list.

Your SK can debuff the piss outta the mob, and the mob will be very
angry with you.  You can dump your entire mana bar pissing it off.  I
get one successful taunt off and the aggro is mine.

When I'm grouped with an SK, I can see him casting his spells.  I know
roughly when that spell is going to hit the mob.  I time my taunt
attempts to coincide with the completion of the spell.  Guess what?
Odds a VERY good the mob won't even take notice of the SK.  Especially
since I'm going to be the closest to the mob in terms of the melee
bubble *AND* swinging my sub 18 delay weapons while the SK is trying
to get his spell off.

Only really fucked up mobs like the Dain (and no, I don't mean the
uber nature of the mob, just the fucked up aggro and the retardedly
small melee bubble) makes this difficult.

But in most exp grind groups, this is NOT a problem.
