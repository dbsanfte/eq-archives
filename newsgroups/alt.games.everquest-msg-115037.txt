Its moot since they removed the language learning restrictions. That
means that if you are a dark elf you can group with a human and spam
each other now and both learn each other's languages to max pretty
fast. Common, for all practical purposes, is the human tongue.

Oh, I think you are talking about Seventh hammer there? Yeah, since
everyone HAS common on regular servers everyone expects you to USE it.

I seriously hope not ;) With all the flak games have taken over people
shooting up schools and such (at least that german guy who played
counter strike or something was a better shot...) that is all we need.
Headlines: "Ding! from video game kills people!"

I just call that the highest form of roleplaying. Its funny how so
many people are afraid of that. To me you should just always play like
the character is the character, not the human controlling them. Its
perfectly fine if you are a male and have a female character, unless
you are cybering someone who thinks you are a female in real life.

No.
There is a 50 dollar fee for switching servers(naked)  but its only
for the same server type. Since there is only one firiona vie,
transfers are not allowed for there. If your character was level 50
with fantastic droppable things, I'd suggest you do what other people
do and sign up for legends for a month, get that char on there with a
new FV char, give the chars lewt to the new FV char, cancel legends
and go back to FV. 

Verant CLAIMS that they check all characters transferring back to
servers such as FV from Legends,  but they DON'T. I know this for a
fact because someone coming back to the Tribunal server, which
previously had only about 2 mana stones on it, told of how they bought
manastones for 35 k plat on the legends server and stuck them on
characters going back to the tribunal server where they sold them for
85 k plat. If they really HAD checked they would have found tribunal
was not around for that long before mana stones were removed, making
manastones a key possible "economy pollution" item.

Here are some reasons why you might want to make a char on FV anyway:

1) with the changes for newbies level 10 is nothing. You'd be at that
on a new char on FV in a day.

2) you can make that char you always wanted to try but never have.

3) all quest items and even many no drop uber armors are DROPPABLE on
FV. That means that eventually people will be selling pretty great
stuff that you can't buy on other servers.

4) the grouping and language restrictions are removed now. You can 
now group with any alignment and learn languages while grouped without
a cap on how fast you can learn. There is still no common, but you can
more or less consider human "common." 

If you try it I think you'll have some fun.
