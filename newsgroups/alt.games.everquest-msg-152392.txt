Most cable IPS have no-no's written into the terms of service. Check
their first. In general they try to discourage people from running Web
sites at home. That is why most use dynamic IP addresses via DHCP.
(Hard to run a Website when your IP address changes every 3-7 days).

Your safest bet is to try and fly under their radar. Don't alert them
to your intentions, and plead ignorance if/when they pounce on you
down the road. 

Another alternative is to rent space with a Web site hosting service.
The main advantages are:

1) The site is not running from your home. You don't have to leave a
PC on 24/7, and you won't have to worry about the Web site eating all
of your bandwidth if you get a lot of traffic.

2) You won't be as vulnerable to attack from hackers. Running the site
out of your home will open you up to attack. You will have to leave a
PC on 24/7, and your IP address will be much more public.

Just some thoughts
