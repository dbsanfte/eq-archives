I don't think the network bandwidth requirements have increased
that much. Nowhere near what the cpu/video requirements have, anyway.

Keep in mind that 56k dialup is never truly 56k. It might be very close
or might be substantially less depending on your wireline distance to 
the telco central office and the topology of the telco network in between.

Even so, EQ's network bandwidth needs are low enough that two sessions
should be doable even over a subpar dialup connection. Zoning might get
rather slow but that's it.
