How's the population on Lanys T'Vyl these days?  That's where my chars
are and I've been thinking about coming back.  The idea of less
crowded areas actually intrigued me, and a server merge might actually
discourage me from coming back.  Unless of course it's pitifully low
population and NEEDS a merger to survive...

I was surprised to see two "normal" servers merge.  Aren't Bristlebane
and Solusek two of the original servers that were available on launch
day?  Or am I remembering wrong?
