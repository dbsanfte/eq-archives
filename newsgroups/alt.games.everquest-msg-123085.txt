You should know that now dying from L1 to L10 (11?) results in NO EXP lose,
and you appear at bind point will all your gear, so NO CORPSE run untill
after that level.

Also I think the exp chart has been made less steep, so attaining L12 will
probably take about 2-3 days (2-3 hours a day) tops.

I find leveling a caster at these levels takes a bit longer than my melee
types, but is still relatively easy to do solo.

Good Luck and Good Hunting!
