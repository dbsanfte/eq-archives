If all you're taking is occasional incidental damage (like ripostes on
raids or overaggro in normal exp groups) then a fungal is like getting
a whack more hp. It is definately worth it and is probably the best
item possible for soloing. You're just not going to get a better chest
item that replaces the hp you regen during a fight soloing that you
would otherwise gain from the fungal.

However if you are in a situation where you are getting complete heals
commonly - main tank in a group (hey, its possible) or something
similar, you might as well go with higher AC and stats. The fungal
isn't going to let the cleric CH you any later if you're being hit for
200 a pop.
