I'm currently having fun with the first character that I fully intend to get
over level 35 with, and as such I gave him a few items and some cash from my
other characters when he hit level 6 (he'll be 15 today).  Not much by most
standards, but he's wearing some splitpaw, small leather, combine scimitar
(getting a velium as soon as I can spot one for sale), savant's cap, small
scarab breastplate and forest loop, and has around 300pp.

I earned the stuff he's wearing, and feel absolutely no shame in wearing it
around at my level. I pay my cash to play the game, same as others do, so I
feel rather justified in "twinking" what will be my main character with a
few items that my stable of other characters can spare.

 I'd never laugh at someone that didn't have equipment equal to mine...
people who do that aren't "twinkers"... they are fucking assholes. On the
other hand, I'm never jealous of those that have better that me, as I have
inspect turned off, as well as inspect notification. I could care less who
looks at my gear, and I have no interest in what others are using. I also
can respect someone not wanting to twink a character, as I did that with my
Monk... I could often be found completely naked in Crushbone, and was often
accused of being a mule when I'd sell the CB belts to other characters. None
of the Woodelves could believe that naked/weaponless monk was getting them
on his own  =)

BTW, I would say that I'm probably not the worlds best grouper, as I'm still
steadily gaining experience in this class. I do spend a good bit of time
soloing (presently fear kiting caimen and crocs in Oasis) but then again,
that's why I chose to make a druid this time. Most of my other characters
are, in my opinion,  more group oriented... especially the Wizard and Monk.
Druids can be extremely beneficial to a group, but they also provide the
flexibility to solo much better than most other classes.

All that aside, the point of this ramble is - Don't judge someone with armor
and weapons better than that which he could have earned with that character.
Some of them aren't assholes, and some of them DO know how to play the
game... and some of us are having a great time doing it.

Matt K
