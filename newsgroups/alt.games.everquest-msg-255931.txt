The petition system is incredibly easy to use. I, and several of my
guildmates, have not had a problem, so don't suggest "no one can figure it
out".

Now about your problem, we have found that if you demand to speak to a
Senior GM, you will normally receive the help you are looking for pretty
fast. I lost 3 items myself due to an LD, and was told by the first GM to
respond that they could not reimburse my items. I demanded to speak with a
Senior GM. Next time I logged in, the three items were in my inventory. One
of my guildmates also got satisfaction after he threatened to report them to
the BBB.

So, head for the top. You should get a favorable response.
