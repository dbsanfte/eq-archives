Without a sugar daddy it's not too bad but.....   from the start, you could
have had from 102 the lowest to 130 the highest starting wisdom if you
placed you points right.  Looking at it that way you've at best you've
raised it from 10 to 38 points in 35 levels.  You should be able to get it
up around 160 to 180 at your level without twinking (no sugar daddy). There
are lots of good, cheap wisdom gear in the bazaar if you have assess to it.
