Absolutely.  Alcohol and opiates are the only drugs I can think of at the
moment which create a physical need for the substance.  Everything else
(cocaine, gambling, EQ, sex) just monkeys with the body's dopamine levels,
making you physically need that particular dopamine "surge" in that
particular part of your brain.  Gambling and cocaine addiction actually
effect the same part of the brain.  I wouldn't be surprised if EQ had a lot
in common with gambling.  In fact, I'm sure it's the same thing.  Which would
mean that EQ is a lot like cocaine, which makes "EverCrack" a pretty apt
nickname.

25 hours, huh?  Is that a lot?  ;-)
