1.  Get a high-level person to drag it out for you.
    If they're high enough level, either nothing
    will aggro on them, or it won't matter.

2.  Get a Rogue to sneak/hide down to your corpse
    and drag it back.

3.  Get a 29+ Druid to drop down the well, clear
    the area, then you drop down after them.  Loot,
    group, and have the Druid port you both back
    to the West Commonlands druid ring.  This is the
    only method that won't require someone to first
    get the two keys that are necessary to walk back
    up out of the third floor, so it's probably the
    quickest unless there's already a higher-level
    person in the zone who has gathered the keys
    already.
