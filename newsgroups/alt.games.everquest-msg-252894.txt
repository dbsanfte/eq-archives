I think its worth to chain cast it,I have SCF3 and an ID4
item,I am sure it deals out more damage than my Stonewood
or my melee weapons.
But not that much ,that I would insist on doing only Nro,
unlike the Pally who has a very good reason with his level 39
undead self proc to do preferably BB.

Somehow I see a disproportion.  :)
Why do Pallies get a 243 damage proc vs. undead at 39
and Rangers a 170 damage proc vs summoned at 65 ?
Not to speak of the fact,that except Nro Ldon and The Hole
there are not a lot of summoned mobs,while on the other 
hand there are undead in nearly every zone.
And what about this  Pally "cleanses his target..." AA?
When I see the damage dealt with that,I nearly want to
delete my Ranger. ;)
