I bought one of these guides recently ('How to make 100,000 plat/month on EQ' -
type thing.)  Since I'm a rather low level player, some of the "tips" were quite
useful to me, although I suspect I could have gotten this same info for free on
the internet if I just knew where to look.  The described plat-making "method"
was rather obvious and I suspect, much more difficult and time consuming to
master than it was presented in the guide.  Sure you can make plenty of plat
from tailoring desirable items and porting your druid around to peddle your
wares.  Even low level players know you can also complete high level quests and
sell off the quest items for plat.  So the plat-making "method", as described in
the guide I purchased, automatically requires you to have at least a Lvl 19
druid to port with, first off, and also a high skill level in tailoring, which I
understand is difficult to master.

Per purchasing these guides, based on what I've seen -- my advice is to save
your money.
