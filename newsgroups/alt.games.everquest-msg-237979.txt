Uhh....not really.  The main reason you have "difficulty getting over
this" is that you are emotionally immature, seemingly to the point of
being an emotional imbecile.  

You seem to think that what is unusual about your story is how badly
you were treated.  Its not, though.  Its your response to the
mistreatment thats unusuaul and excessive.

Almost everyone who lives in an industrial democracy gets involved in
multiple romantic relationships over the course of his or her life,
and gets treated badly during a break up at some point. The
overwhelming majority of us manage to get over it without whining to a
bunch of total strangers and asking them to make crank phone calls to
our former partner and his/her spouse.  We just call the partner who
has rejected us a few unkind names, mope a few days, then move on.
Thats because most people understand that what will make one happy is
not repeatedly 'getting even' with a cruel partner...its finding a new
one, or just moving on in life generally.  Its not like there are no
other sources of happiness and satisfaction but romance.

If you want to belong to the minority who bitch and whine at every
opportunity about how you were mistreated, and who think they're going
to get sympathy when they do....well...good luck.  But it won't make
you happy and most of the people to whom you repeat your story will
think you are contemptible, self-absorbed loser more than a hapless
victim.  Not like it makes much difference even if they're
sympathetic.  A barrel full of sympathy isn't worth a pinch of
self-respect.
