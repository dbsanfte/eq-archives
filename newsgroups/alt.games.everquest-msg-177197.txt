Really?  You mean the posts you've made about playing a Druid were based
on actual experience and weren't just flights of fancy?  Well, I'll be
damned! who'da thunk?  :-p

This is a public forum, and I don't think I've managed to make
everybody's killfile yet, so I do sometimes try to explain myself
even when the person I'm nominally replying to doesn't need the
explanation.  Besides, we do have at least one person posting here
who has claimed to have a 60 Druid and then asserted that Druids
are hard to level and are not good soloers, so I figure it's not
really possible to be too careful.
