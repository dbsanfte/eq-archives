    Don't want 'em uber, but just a little more powerful... actually I think
my 52 pet will change my outlook on that, the 49 one actually does damage
and *can* tank for the 3 seconds i need to changeover from kiting to fear
kiting (I don't pull with snare cos it takes too long to get to the start of
the safe-pathe)

    But dots... oh baby. A level 48 sk has dots that *Stack* to (from
memory) 428 over 1.5 mins.... thats if you cast all three on a mob. The
casting time of all three added up takes more damage out of your melee
output than 428 with any weapon a 48 sk is likely to be holding. Our
nastiest dot at that level is 174hp....  (my car has more hp)

    NOT that I'm complaining. I love my "annoy monster" dots and my foraged
vegetables pet. But another lame DoT isn't going to make me buy legend of
ya'cashier :)

Cheers,
James
