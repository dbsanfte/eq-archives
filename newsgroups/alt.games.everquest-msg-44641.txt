(more things about doing port for donations)
I disagree, I tried this an Vazaelle and only got crap for payments. since
then I have forgotten to collect the payment TWO times before I ported, in
BOTH cases once we reached the other side the person refused to pay. Now I
hate it, but have to insist upon payment before I port. In fact, I would up
leaving someone behind on a port because he said he's pay HALF now and HALF
when we arrived. I told him the rest of the group(that responded to my
auction) had already paid and he could pay or stay... and he didn't pay so
we left him.

On the flip side, I do agree that you can make alot of money porting. The
trick is to find a nice place with people with lots of money. I've had good
luck in Kunark with people paying 25-30p each for a port. (this is what they
offered, I never ask for more than 10 unless someone contacts me
unsolicited, and in that case usually 20, but sometimes, a polite but firm
no.
