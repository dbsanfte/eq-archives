Which is exactly what Bin Laden wants... Three years after 9/11 Osama 
Bin Laden is still alive, healthy, active and in control, while 
Afghanistan slides slowly back into chaos and the Taliban regroup and 
reorganize, because the US abandoned the War on Terror in favour of the 
War for Halliburton. The last thing Bin Laden would want is a US 
president that turns his gaze away from Iraq and back towards him.

Unfortunately, it appears that his plan is working beautifully.
