> All my characters solo. In order of soloing preference:
> 1. Half-Elf Bard level 17.
> 2. Human Druid Level 16.
> 3. Ogre SK level 13.
> 3. Troll Warrior level 9.
> 3. Half-Elf Rogue level 10.
> 3. Human Monk Level 11.
> 3. Half-Elf Ranger Level 15. (Don't like rangers anymore.)
> 3. Erudite Enchanter level 10 (Ergh. Might remake it as a human.)
> 3. Iksar Necromancer Level 3.

Do not take this the wrong way, but I can't help but chuckling at this.
EVERY class can solo to at least 15, so the above is rather useless
information as far as showing which classes can solo.

> Of all of them, my favorite and the easiest to solo is my level 17 bard.
> They are surprisingly self-sufficient.

I wholeheartedly agree.   There's a rough patch in the 20's before you get
charm, but once you get charm (very low resist on reds), your soloing will
outshine EVERY other class until 45 or so.  There's just no other class who
can kill two reds at one time, without getting hit, and continue on
afterwards with not one second of downtime.

Bard meditate is nothing more than a way to mem songs.  It does not affect
our mana, and it doesn't go up.

If anything, what you're doing above is not feasable.  It takes 10 minutes
to kill a mob that way, not to mention the finger ache.  Soloing at high
levels is ten times more feasable.  Charm kiting, fear kiting, and chant
kiting (the least risky) are all great methods.
