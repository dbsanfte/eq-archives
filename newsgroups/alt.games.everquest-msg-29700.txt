I found at level 6, i couldn't even really zone in and try
to get a group from the maybe 5 or so people in there, cause
i would get jumped by at least two kobolds as soon as I
would summon my pet.  I spent several late teen levels there
with my druid, as well as taking my shadowknight there
around 14.  My druid loved it, my shadowknight hated it,
went to Kerra ridge, got in a good group, and was 16 in
about two play sessions.  Went back and it wasn't too bad
(clinging darkness to deal with runners).  When I have seen
groups in there they tend to be minimum of level 10.  I got
a couple of nice drops from there, I got a packmasters lash
twice.  gave it away both times, with my shadowknight.  My
druid got the ball peen hammer at least 4 times, and gave
them all away (didn't realize on the last one I had passed
the trivial level damn it).  He also got the filth covered
boots off the packmaster, which I still wear until I can get
some decent wisdom boots.  I got the shield off the Prince,
and gave that to a newbie barb shaman, figuring that as
heavy as it was, shaman were who it was designed for.  It's
not a bad dungeon, but I would say your going to want to be
around level 10 or so, before going in and prob a little
higher to solo.  around 15 The Jailer is blue I think, and
is good experience solo, plus you can turn in the keys he
drops to the erudite prisoners for experience.  I also found
that the kerran in the room with the erudites, was decent
experience at 14, and that room is a decent place to sit to
med up as nothing paths through it.  

It pretty much all is becoming trivial around 25.  at 25 I
think there were 3 mobs that weren't green.  The King, The
High Shaman next to him, and Mugulwump.  At that Point I
knew it was time to move on.  I am anxiously awaiting
Stonebrunt Mtns. with my Druid.  I just hope he isn't too
high when I get there.
