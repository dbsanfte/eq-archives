I have a P2.6, 512MB RAM, 64MB GF4-4200 and I can't run with all the bells &
whistles on.  I'm not sure there's a system sold under $3k that can
satisfactorily (MY opinion of "satisfactorily" which may be quite a bit more
picky than yours) run EQ with all the bells & whistles.

But yup, you're going to have to buy an honest-to-god gaming video card.
