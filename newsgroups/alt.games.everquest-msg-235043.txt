Okay, here's what you need to do.  Take the disc out of your machine, set it
aside and the next time you cook something in a pan and forget to wash it
for a day or two and all the grease and food is caked on there, use the disc
to scrape the pan.  Then find whatever else you can creatively use that disc
for around the house.  Because as a game CD it is virtually worthless,
unless your like Brewster and have to spend 1 million dollars in a period of
time or something.

Drab graphics, lousy storyline, horrible controls, illogical game setup,
etc.  Biggest disappointment in gaming history in my opinion.  Sony should
have stuck with what they're good at, MMORPG's rather than trying to make
EverCraft.

But seriously, no clue on your problem, but you're honestly not missing
much.
