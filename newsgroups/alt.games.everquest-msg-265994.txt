This theme has been debated to death. Lots of folks have argued vehmently 
for the WoW-styled exclamation points and question marks over the head, but 
most have rejected this as too immersion-breaking. I agree that it's 
sometimes too hard to tell what quest steps are available in the current 
zone, but I've also found that if you go back and read the quest text 
carefully it's usually sufficient. I think my ratio here is something like 
85% satisfactory, 10% ambiguous, 5% braindead obtuse.

I'm not sure I really want a flashing indicator telling me everytime I enter 
a zone that I have a pending quest step in the zone. I know plenty of people 
would, but a) it would get old after a few trips in and out of North Qeynos, 
and b) it moves too many steps forward in the handholding direction for my 
tastes. Personally, I think the Waypoint option in the quest journal is too 
much, and I don't think I've ever used it once except for an occasional 
shard recovery.

That was an ugly one. When did you last see this? That bug was outrageous a 
few days ago and got to its high point when they were adding in all the 
tradeskill quests. This got particularly bad with City Quests where you had 
multiple quests to kill a mob type that was usually found mixed with other 
types. So, for example, I would have a quest that required me to kill some 
gnoll shamans, and another separate quest to kill some gnoll soldiers. If I 
came across a group that was made up of gnoll shamans and gnoll soldiers (as 
many of them are behind Claymore), the quest journal would get terribly 
confused and sit there saying over and over again that I had a journal 
update, and then sometimes reporting the updates 5 minutes after getting 
them. Zoning sometimes updated correctly and sometimes did not. I still have 
never received proper credit for over 40,000 status points I earned over the 
course of a couple of days testing that system and I must have logged around 
20 bugs on it. Something that ugly may retain some lingering effects and 
it's area I'd be watching for on Tuesday, but I haven't seen it return after 
being fixed in the recent stream of hotfixes.

Maybe this is one of the reasons they reduced the number to 50. I assumed it 
was a resource management issue but they may have been anticipating the kind 
of organizational confusion you're describing.

LOL! Well, different strokes I guess. I think there are some voices like 
that (the steward at the Willow Wood docks is a good example, he is 
embarassingly dumb sounding), but overall I've found most of them sound 
pretty professional. Some of the obvious caricatures are probably over the 
top (like Bryan Shoreclinger in WW or that really vain guy in Starcrest). 
Did you get a chance to interact with the roleplaying froglok in Castleview 
Hamlet? I'm curious what category you'd put him in. I think he's delightful, 
but you might find him over the top in melodrama.
