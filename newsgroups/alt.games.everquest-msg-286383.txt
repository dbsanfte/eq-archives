Let's hope.  Rampage mobs suck when they keep moving around.

They are definitely going to be doing something to AAs in any patch.
Apparently the higher levels of a lot (if not all) multi-expansion series
AAs aren't actually working anymore.  For me, critical mend is the big
impact, where with my AAs for it maxed I averaged about 80% critical mends
before and now I'm averaging about 50%.  I have heard similar regarding the
higher levels of attack crits, heal crits, etc., though those are a lot
harder (for me) to notice.
