As this slides decidely off topic...

At any rate, legalising crack and heroin and selling it at 7-11 isn't 
really going to solve any problems.

And if you don't sell it at 7-11 and make it a restricted prescription 
deal instead the black market for street drugs will persist.

This isn't a 'simple' problem with a simple solution.
