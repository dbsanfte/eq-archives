Since this cause much confusion in me, I'll answer my own question as I have
done that part of the quest now: At least on 'The Tribunal' Server, Invis
to animals works like a charm at level 47. I don't know if this is level
dependent or stat dependent or anything, but Killer Sharks just plain
ignored me while I sat around, speaking to the dead guys.

: 4 should be enough, but you can get fish scales in the pond in the middle

True .. I think I justed just two fish scales ... Endure Breath lasts 27 Minutes
and you spend less down there in the Ocean than 54 Minutes (40?). Aside from
that: The pond in Kithicor contains Piranhas, that drop loads of fish scales :)
