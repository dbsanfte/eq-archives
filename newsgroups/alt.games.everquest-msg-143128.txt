I was piddling around EC with my necro when I heard "wtb handmade 
backpacks".  Was dying a LOT (I petitioned, of course.  /petition I'm 
dying a lot and I'm a necro.  I must be bugged) so I figured what the 
hell, sent him a tell asking how much - 150pp PER BAG.  Uh... how many 
would you like, kind sir?  I sold him one, then, thanking every god of 
Norrath I'd parked Taellaar in EC, I gave him 3 more and got him to give 
the money to my necro (and he even tipped me 50pp :)).  Then... I went 
to the Bazaar.  ::happy sigh::  I haven't had that much fun since I sold 
1k worth of spider silks on Taellaar *g*  (yes, Mr. Rimer, that was 
*after* I got twinked by some insane high level :))  I got a bit 
frustrated trying to figure out which items were best (okay that one has 
3int and 10 mana and 25hp but that one has 20hp and 20 mana and 3 int 
and this one has 4 int and 30hp and 15 mana and... ::erk::).  I finally 
gave up and went by int first if I could afford it (although afterward I 
thought perhaps that was a mistake - I know int *used* to be the better 
choice, what with the mana cap, but now that that's going/gone...), mana 
second, hp third.  And a bonus for any focus effects I didn't have.

The only thing I'm wondering about is, what the heck kind of weapon 
should I get?  I have just over 300pp left still, not sure how much 
necros tank when soloing at higher levels, but right now I find fear 
more trouble than it's worth (clinging darkness doesn't seem to slow em 
up much) Well anyway, I *was* still using the piercer I got at birth 
until I got a crystal webshield and moved the opal encrusted stein to my 
primary slot today, so no other skills are trained.  OTOH I know 
absolutely nothing about what kind of nice weapons are out there for 
necros, or even if it's worth getting a weapon.  But since I'm now 
dealing with a pet that doesn't con yellow when I first start casting it 
anymore, I suspect I'll be in there tanking more often, and I'd like to 
at least deal a bit of damage while I'm in there and trying to cast 
around the hits anyway.  Anybody with any suggestions is welcome to 
speak up.

Ryou
