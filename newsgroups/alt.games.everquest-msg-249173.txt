As someone else mentioned, make a copy of your EQ directory.  I also
noticed a modest boost when I put that directory on a separate drive.
That instance of EQI have "de-tuned" significantly.  Same resultion,
but models and effects and sound all turned off - and usually I have
the clip plane in a bunch too (usually just botting a druid or my
cleric).
Works great for me on what used to be a high-end system, but isn't so
special any more.  (AMD XP2500+ barton, 1GB ram, GF4200ti).

Also, look into EQ Play Nice if you need to eek out a bit more 'oomph'
for 2 boxing on one box on a 'lesser' machine.
