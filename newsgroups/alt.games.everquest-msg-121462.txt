Past level 35 plat isn't that big of a deal in Rathe Mts a level 35 can make
300-400p in a full group in a night killing Hill Giants. When you can solo
them I was making 300p an hour in Rathe mts, more in other zones. Once you
find mobs that you can solo that drop decent Items you can start pharming
and selling for even more plat. If I set my mind to it and had the buyers
lined up I could make 10,000p or more in an 8 hours session pharming items.
