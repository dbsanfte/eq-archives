	I don't understand that at all...  The mage fights by using the
pet to tank (best pet tank in the game) and assisting with a set of nukes
second only to a full blown wizard.  The necro fights by applying 10 dots 
and using the pet as dot #11, or sometimes by "tap tanking" which is 
applying 10 dots, using the pet as dot #11, and healing yourself with
life taps while the mobs summons you...
