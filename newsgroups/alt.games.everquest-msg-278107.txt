I was surprised to see the DVD edition of EQ2 for sale at Fry's for only 
$19.99.

Amazon.com and GameStop.com have it for $24.99.

These are the DVD edition, mind you. The cheapest I can find WoW, just for 
the sake of comparison, is $44.99.

Now I'm no economist or business administration wiz (although I did stay at 
a Holiday Inn a couple of times), but I can't imagine SoE chopping the 
price like that if everything were all fine and dandy. You've just gotta 
think that there are some tense meetings going on in the EQ2 camp.

While this latest Station Exchange abomination was the last straw for me, I 
found the biggest problem with EQ2 was the overall generic, I might even 
say soulless, approach to the core gameplay elements and mechanics. I felt 
that in locking it down the way they did, thereby insuring their complete 
control over all aspects of game balance, they effectively dilluted it and 
made it much less interesting. 

IMO, you can't simply make the attack/heal/buff/de-buff ratios for all 
classes effectively equivalent and still maintain any sort of flavor among 
the classes. Sure shaman and druids go about healing differently, but that 
difference was really only interesting for a while. After that they were 
just two healers and it bacame a game of four archetypes (three really, 
when you consider that scouts and mages were designed to perform the same 
base function) rather than 16 classes.

I also found it interesting that they decided to wait a week after their 
announcement of the Station Exchange to conduct a poll to gather some 
direct feedback from the customer base. I logged in a couple times within 
the past week just to offer my 2c worth on the poll, but it was never 
presented to me. It makes me wonder if the set it up to only be offered to 
active subscribers, excluding those of us who quit out of disapproval and 
thereby further padding their numbers.

All this really made me miss EQLive, so that's where I am, and I'm enjoying 
myself again. Perhaps SoE should have just gone with developing a new 
completely new MMORPG idea or merely bolstering one they already have (I've 
got loads of sympathy for the SWG folk, for sure).

They've done the EQ franchise no justice with the sequel as far as I'm 
concerned.
