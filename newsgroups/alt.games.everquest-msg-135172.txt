Linux is definitely more widely used nowadays, but I don't think it's 
quite "whole countries". The scale you imply that it is now being used 
seems a bit off. Nevertheless, an OpenGL option would be nice. OpenGL does 
tend to perform better than Direct3D in most cases, however it's easier 
for designers to only include D3D (unfortunately).
