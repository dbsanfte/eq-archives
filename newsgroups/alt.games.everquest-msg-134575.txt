First I heard of this!

My UHOF doesn't report health back very often at all, I'm not set
up well for pet commands anyway, and he's lucky to survive one
or two ripostes... a HP bar would give me warning after the first
so I might throw a small heal in at him, or heck, knowing I can
monitor him more easily, buff his HP up to survivable

My bard alt, though is even more excited, wondering if this
will allow him to monitor his charmed pets while he charm
and swarm kites his way across the face of Norrath (and Luclin)

My druid mumbled something about not being allowed to level
up to his own useless pet level
