ToV quest armour?
I don't think any class came out as badly as monks with any of the velious
quest pieces (nothing new seens as pof gear was so trash)

I've got the tov bracer (which I don't wear) for the right click, the legs
for the right click (which im wearing till I get ancient wyvern), but
nothing else even has a worthwhile effect, let alone stats (imo)

I guess thats why we get first dibs on ancient wyvern (ive got the bp so
far) and lord bob
