The "world's safest car" currently belongs to Volvo
(http://info.insure.com/auto/volvo702.html); it's a prototype safety car
that they're working on.  It incorporates an astounding array of safety
features (night vision enhancement, 4-point seatbelts, blind-spot radar
detection, nose airbag for pedestrians you hit, individual height-adjustable
seats, heartbeat sensor...).  The interesting thing is that according to
Volvo all of the safety items are off-the-shelf items, i.e., currently
available.  (I wonder where I can get that blind-spot radar device?)
Unfortunately, it also costs about $10,000,000.  Literally.  Admitted, it's
a prototype, but you can bet the cost of a production line vehicle is still
gonna be extremely high.

And it *still* can't make you (or anyone else) 100% safe.

There's one change I'd like to see in their safety car, a software change.
If (door is closed) AND (door has not been opened in the past minute) AND
(heartbeat was detected 5 seconds ago) AND (heartbeat is not currently
detected) THEN (fire off every alarm, flash the lights, and scream blue
murder).
