As long as I'm delurked (see "Seeking advice on Cheal thread), lemme ask 
about an item I've been scheming to acquire since I heard of it.  

My main is a 44 barbarian shaman.  Very soon now, I'll be 45 and can proc 
the jaundiced bone armor's right-click effects.   So, like every shaman at 
about this age, I start hoping to pick up a Jaundiced Bone Bracer.

Now, the question.  What are my chances of being able to put my hands on 
one?  Do they even make it out of Sebilis before being snapped up?  If they   
do come on the market, what price range would I be looking at?  This is on 
Rodcet Nife, I know servers vary greatly so this may be unanswerable.  Does 
Rodcet Nife have an auction board?  I've never been able to find one.  

I have about 4k stashed in the JBB fund (on a mule, to keep me from 
spending it!), and I doubt this is even going to come close to the amount I 
need, if in fact it is buyable.  WHere might a good place to earn money at 
this level be?  I have a regular group I hunt with (two warriors, cleric, 
wizard, shaman if it matters) so they might help me out in my money hunt, 
but solo options would be nice too :)

Thanks for any advice you can give!
