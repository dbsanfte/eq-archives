Well, maybe.  I don't know what the HP penalty for STA below 75 is.
A better way to look at it would be that the lowest functional STA
for a melee is 100, as below 100 you suffer serious penalties when
you're fatigued (yellow stamina bar runs out).  That gives you 180
((45/10)*40) more HP than the worst any Warrior with half-a-clue
should have at L40 (ignoring any +HP items you have).  But don't
obsess over stats, your total HP is what matters, not your HP from
STA.
