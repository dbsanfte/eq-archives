/agree

It doesn't make much sense to me to start a new group when even some of 
the most loyal EQLive players have been among those to predict its demise 
within a year or so. It's not like Baldur's Gate or Morrowind. When EQL 
is over, it's over. There will be no one playing it and no need for 
discussion.

I'm still of the belief that a.g.e. is the best place for discussion of 
both. I try to denote EQ2: on any such posts (will change to [EQ2] now, 
thanks for the tip), but there will come a point when it won't be 
necessary.
