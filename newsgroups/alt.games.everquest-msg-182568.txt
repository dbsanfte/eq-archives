Crunch of snow, crack of ice
tundra lives, through the night.
Cougar claws up the hill,
shatters deep, frigid still.

Padded paws, booted feet,
Lord and Wolf, running heat.
Hearts as one, in the chill,
frigid air, their lungs filled.

Quick command, sent to kill,
flash of claw, sharp as steel.
Teeth cut through hide and bone.
Warder's skills, finely honed.

Battle's won,prey gone still.
Flash of light, wounds are healed.
Claw and Fist, Fang and Might.
Lord and Wolf, own the night.


Yowen MacTavish 52 Beastlord on Mith Marr
