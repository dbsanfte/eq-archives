In killing off the goods, you're helping the evils.  Where will you
kite if you're constantly being trained or ganked by 10 evils at a
time and losing exp when you die? On Kunark a whole continent of evils
is gaining levels unmolested. I'm an evil DE, and when I stand in WC,
I don't even think about getting ganked by halflings. Think not too
far into the future, when the good team is no more, and the neutrals
are outnumbered 20 to one by the evils. When the evils control
Antonica, Faydwer, Odus, Kunark, and all the territory up to
Rivervale. No good or newt will be able to pass level 6, and those
that are already past level 6 will have to constantly fend off ganking
attempts by 30 or 40 evils in every zone. With the good and newt
population devided, eventually both teams will be ground to dust under
the weight of the evil team, and Sullon Zek will basically become a
blue server with no one to kill. There's a difference between a
challenge and the Battan death march.
