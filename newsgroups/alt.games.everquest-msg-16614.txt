The hangman's noose is really your ONLY option. It can take many many trips
to PoA to get a quest belt, and you do not often see guilds making more
than a handful of trips up there per year.

There are often people hunting on the hunter/forager cycle...get a group
with someone who can track, and hunt away. You might get other good stuff
while you are doing it.
