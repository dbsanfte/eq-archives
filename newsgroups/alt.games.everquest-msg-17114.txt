Not being a baker, I can't tell you much about that.  But at lvl 15, I'd say
you're going to be putting in a lot more money getting your sewing skills up
than anything you can make for profit.  As a money maker, I'd say the best
thing to do is to ride the boat to the little island between Erudin and
Qeynos and hunt wisps, then doing the GL quest in N. Karanas.  You can make
around 9 pps per GL plus you get an exp bonus for the quest.  Only problem
is, the island is pretty crowded.

On your way to N Karanas, try to buy as many GL's as you can on the way,
many people know about the quest but are pretty lazy to do it.  They'll sell
you their stones for around 6pp.  Don't pay more than that tho, you'll not
recoup much money back.

(My lvl 7 bard used to make GL runs all the time.  I bought stones for 5-6pp
then finished the quest to make a few plats off of that.  I leveled to 12
without fighting anything!  Just running around with Selos.  Kinda paid for
that when I needed to fight wisps on my own -- lvl 12 with lvl 7 skills.)

Good luck.

John
