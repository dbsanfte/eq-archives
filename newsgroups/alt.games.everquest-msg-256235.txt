Low, but I don't think "severely lacking" is an accurate description.
At these levels your skills go up very quickly. In a group at this
level, I doubt it'd be noticeable. Even if it was, an hour of grouping
would just about max everything out anyway, and wouldn't make an
impact on the efficiency of the group. We are talking about at most 5
to 10 free levels if you are really working hard at the bone chip
thing. Some time with a trainer would get your important skills to a
point where they are reasonable. I don't see much problem.

On the other hand telling the group that your skills are a little low,
would be a good idea in any case. Honesty is the best policy, except
when a woman asks you if "this makes me look fat".
