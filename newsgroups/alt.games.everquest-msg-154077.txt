You are talking about a fair chunk of traffic that bursts in very large 
peak periods. That is spendy.

National carrier meaning a LEC of some sort, no? I am not talking about 
just loop costs, I am talking about the kind of money one has to spend for 
4-5 9s of redundant IP transit.

Given the 400megabit someone else threw in to this thread, that is three 
OC3's before you even factor redundant physical loops and redundant 
carriers into the mix.

I guess "corporate accounts" would allow you to see money spent on backups, 
RMA's on the many many servers in operation, the sunk cost of building the 
serrver farm in the first place, all the ongoing customer service and 
development, and the myriad other costs this game is sure to incur.

I don't pretend to know all those costs either, but I have some inkling of 
what a massive nightmare this game must be to its admins and I feel that my 
$.43 per day is well spent.

And? Video streams don't typically run for 10 hours at a whack either.
