Indeed.  He only posted twice as many messages as I did over the last four
years. (1)

Fucking slacker.




(1) I appear to have posted 3500 messages, since I began in 1999.   2200 of
them within the last three years. (2)

Graeme has about 3920 posts under that name.
Celaeno 4100.
Dark Tyger 9560.
Ben Sisson 2720.
Graefaxe 1500.
Sean Kennedy 3250 (not counting his previous name from 99'ish)
David Navarro 3930 (not counting his previous name from 99'ish)
Dennis Francis Heffernan  4340. (including a vanity thread in 1999 that was
the first hit.  Heh.)
Lance Berg 4460
James Grahme 2560
Remington Stone 2680
Kaev 3480
Annie Benson-Lennaman 1510
