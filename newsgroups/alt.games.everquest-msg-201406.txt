Im not sure about that.
My paladin duoed with a chanter quite a bit from 50-55 and the extra 
damage from the dual-wielding chanter pet did help with our overall 
damage output (especially since it is a once-off expenditure of mana).
Its a pain to get them into combat however, but a lot easier using root.
