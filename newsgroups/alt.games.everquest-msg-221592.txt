Sorry, wasn't trying to put you down or anything but the last SK that
told told me what a rush it was to get through Veksar managed to train
us up in the 'remains' camp. ... since then I much prefer the ones
that consider it trivial <g>. 

I don't want to state the obvious but but since you mentioned random
duration invis ... If you're on an old enough server. a pre-nerf
circlet of shadows would make that a non-issue for regular invis.

An SK I often grouped with at nobles back when we were farming them
for spell money used to single pull any named that was up to
highborns. Now _that_ always impressed the hell out of me. He'd
somehow get the mob to the main CY and have it push him through the
fence to us.   Not sure if that's even still possible though, back
then you could cast through the fences,
