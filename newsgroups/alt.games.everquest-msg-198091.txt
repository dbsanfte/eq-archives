The gnoll chain is for newbie ranger armor in Surefall, the gnoll leather is
for druids.  I got almost a full set of the newbie armor when I first
started my druid.  It takes things like giant rat pelts, whisker bat fur,
and stuff like that, some of which is no drop.  I was thinking maybe they
added something similar for Barbarians; the no drop thorax, bone, etc. sound
like ingredients that would be used in the quests.
