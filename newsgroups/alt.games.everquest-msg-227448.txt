I couldn't think of any other way where fast leveling = cash.  Since I 
was under the (perhaps mistaken) impression that the missive was 
addressing Plat cheats, here was my stab at connecting the dots.

If you can think of another way that fast exp = plat production (heck 
-a- way, since as I point out, the essence emerald bit doesn't actually 
create wealth) name it.

Not used as, Was originally.  See above, it says "there was an 
experience cheat that allowed extremely fast leveling"

I was trying to convert an xp cheat into a PP cheat.  But most people 
read the missive as addressing a wide variety of cheating methods, so 
the XP to PP conversion wasn't necessary after all.
