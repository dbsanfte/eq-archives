I'm not a group type person - I prefer to solo.  But if you can't find a group,
why not start your own?
Check out eqatlas for maps and details on a zone so you don't walk unknowingly
into a "lesser faydark".  Really, LF is NOT a place for lower levels to hang
out.
The Clerics guild is either in the town of Kelethin or Felwith.
 
> HELLO, where's the "Cleric's Guild"? Not on any map at eqatlas...
