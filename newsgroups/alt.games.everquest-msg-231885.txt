The latency would suck, but have you looked into satellite internet?  You
could at least work on tradeskills then, or do stuff in the Bazaar, or chat
with friends.

I don't recall if you are much of a FPS fan, but have you looked into games
like Medal of Honor?  Because of the historical setting and mission
approach, these feel closer to RPGs than to Quake-like games.

There's a new WWII FPS out whose name I don't recall (I saw someone playing
it at work--although it could be a demo and the game might not be out yet)
that looked great, and the missions were group oriented--you and a squad
of NPC allies that looked like they had pretty good AI.

Actually, if I had several months away from the net, I'd consider getting
into more traditional games again.  I'd get a copy of Fritz (chess) or a
good Go program, and take a few good books on whichever of those games I
picked, and go wild. :-)

Amazon says June 1.  Gamestop.com says March 1(!).
