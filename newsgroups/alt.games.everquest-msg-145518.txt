    Ooh, cleric experiences! *grabs popcorn*

    That's about the best bracer he drops, tied with the WIS and INT ones.
We happened to find him up last night after clearing Rumblecrush, and got
the CHA one. =( BTW - if ever you want to see who in the guild is cool under
pressure, wipe out in Vex Thal then have Rumblecrush pop as everyone is
running back for corpse summons.

    Oh, they're so easy. Really. Bot clerics can do CH rotation if they have
a reasonable connection.

    Main tank switching is always fun. Someone always takes a dirt nap
during a switch.

    Eeeeewwwwww!

    Monual, can you count to four? If you can, never, ever use /pause in a
CH rotation hotkey again. It takes away all of your flexibility to pick up
healing speed (as you discover later), to change to someone new, to do
ANYTHING useful. You aren't a bot, don't use a bot's hotkey.

    Bad place to set up. There's a smooth area of zone wall near the zone to
Vex Thal that's much better - few to no adds pulling there.

    It always is the first time. As you get experienced, well, let's just
say I eat dinner while we kill the Emperor in Ssra. ;-) "One, two, three,
hit CH key, take a bite of dinner, rod, one, two...."

    CH rotation is set up so the main tank will live through the worst
expected round of attacks. So usually, you're overhealing. The only times
you back off the speed are if the mob gets slowed, or uses a /disc again. As
an aside - 4 clerics on three seconds is almost silly fast, since your CH
will take ten seconds and refill on your spell gems is two seconds if no
insta-click is used. So they're giving you two seconds to pick up and use a
mod rod or just enough time to get the gem to refill. Very tight timing, and
people die lots when timing is tight.

    This is why counting is superior. ;-) You can count from the cleric in
front of you, or from the cleric two in front of you for extra security. If
you know when they're supposed to go, you can give them a second and if they
don't go cover for them.

    See? /pause is the devil!!!

    It's a downtime-sorta piece of gear. Personally I see it going to solo
classes like druids and wizards before a cleric.

    Again, a very tight healing setup. Three would have been physically
impossible, BTW, so glad they decided against it. ;-)

    And you're too far away. So what you do, if you aren't next in the
chain, is /assist the first person you can figure out that has the next main
tank targetted. Some guilds have spotters do this for every tank
transition - they /tar the main tank, then do some emote like /hug so you
know to assist them. You can also watch the other CH rotation clerics - as
soon as one announces a CH, they must have the target - assist them.

    Or you can do this. ;-)

    My lord, you really hit every CH rotation problem in one night, didn't
you? Have to be careful about targetting when you pick stuff up. In this
case, though, the solution is easy - /assist one of the other CH clerics,
who you know are on the right target. You should also have trades set to OFF
in situations like these so the mage making rods doesn't open a trade window
with you, or other such goof-up. It also helps if you wipe and someone boxes
you - I've seen the last cleric boxed during a wipeout lose his res box
because a well-meaning mage handed him a mod rod "for after you res in".

    With me, it's the graphics lag when my inventory screen opens up that
makes me flinch. I'm very happy for the black windows where your picture
used to be - it's helped cut graphics lag down a fair chunk.

    Always need mod healing, always always. Shamans with Torpor make good
mod healers, or level 60 necromancers with Zevfeer's. Seems like you DID
encounter every possible CH rotation problem, except for OOR! ;-)

    They must have been killing themselves laughing. "Why is Monual running
up to Gozzrem during tank transitions? Why is he shouting - Gozz is dead?"
These are the moments you look back on and laugh at once you're past them.

    Is that the area at the base of the big pyramid? It's quite a
challenge - most servers call it 4C, for "Four Corners".

    Good show, Monual!!!
