The game is EQ with guns.  It is fun.  The graphics are good and I'd have to
say the exteriors are better than EQ.  There are a lot of appearance options
available, especially for outfits to wear while hanging around the city.

There are mission consoles that will issue you a mission.  A mission is a
mini-dungeon offering a variety of activities (assassination, theft,
observation, repair, etc) that only you and your group can enter (thus no
crowds or campers to contend with).  

The outdoor zones are large and prey is usually plentiful.  Any killstealing is
usually by mistake.

There is no significant downtime, due to meds and nano-pool (aka "mana") drugs.

Death is usually a minor sting as you can "save" your character at the many
insurance terminals whenever you want to.  You lose only the exp and gear you
have gained since the last save.  Unfortunately there is a bug in this process
that emerged yesterday and not all the insurance terminals work, but that will
be fixed).  You also auto-save when you level.

Bank terminals are also widely available, including at outposts in the
wilderness.

Nano programs replace spells, and managing and casting them is quite similar to
EQ.  All classes get nano formulae, the "caster" classes (which I have not yet
played) get more.

I believe AO will be a success after they surmount launch issues.  The game
will add to the overall number of online gamers by bringing out players who
don't like fantasy settings (I see comments on tactical boards that ammount to
"MMOGs are an interesting idea, but I don't like elves and dragons").

Because it is a skill system game disguised as a class system game, the
character types will not be as distinct as they are in EQ.  Characters will be
either shooters or melee, regardless of class, unless they are casters.  I
don't yet know the differences in the caster types.

I'm keeping my EQ account and plan to play both.

Current problems are annoying, but not unexpected (with one or two exceptions).

I recommend 256M of RAM as a minimum and a DSL connection.
