"Patch time is also when various changes to gameplay, some good, some
other, are made."

"some good, some other" is grammatically horrific and you overused
commas.

"Patch time is also when various changes to gameplay (some good, some
not so good) are made." is considerably better.

I'm not posting this as a grammar flame, but since you asked, there's
an answer for you. :-)
