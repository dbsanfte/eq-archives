Quickest way to raise MerchantsOfErudin faction:

Go to freeport. Buy bucketloads of small lanterns (the inn near the EFP
gate and the half-elf in the blue building by the NFP bank sell them I
believe). Turn them in to Jyle Windshot upstairs in the Hogcaller inn in
WFP (*not* the other Jyle Windshot). He will give you a treant wood
'wooden shard' for each one and they stack (you may also get a treant
heart, but it's lore so you'll not get more than one). Collect several
stacks of these and head back to Tox, where you can give them to Emil
Parsini, the woodcrafter in the hut just outside Erudin, for good hits
on three Erudin factions, including merchants, (Council and Guards are
the others I believe) and no bad faction hits.

The quest, if done as intended, involves handing in a few things in
Qeynos I believe, to get *one* treant wood shard to hand in to Emil
(part of some Peacekeeper quest I think). By getting the shards from
Jyle Windshot instead, who hands them out for the Trueshot bow quest,
you can effectively do this faction-building part of the quest hundreds
of times in one journey. May even be good xp at low level, I've not
tried it with any character low enough to get xp from it.
