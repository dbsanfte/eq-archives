    If Tiru is non-KOS to live frogs, or if you have pretty much any good
race character that you haven't killed frogs with, take them down to look
around. The only mob that will attack them would be the Huge Water
Elemental, and by clinging to the side of his room and moving quickly you
should avoid aggro. The names of the frogs indicate levels in exactly the
same way as they would in Sebilis - so yes, the King's room will be blue to
you. It contains King PH/King, two guard frogs, and two shaman frogs most of
the time, and is fairly small (like all Guk rooms), so plan appropriately.
If you bring a party down you can pull for quite some time, getting XP and
the odd resist gear item, and use the teleporter at the back of the room
when you want to leave.
