When I want the toughest pet possible I summon foci for the pet -
they add 160hp and more AC (2 bracers, 2 rings, 2 earrings, neck,
shoulders.)  I also summon an elemental defender -- give your pet
weapons first then the shield and he'll equip it on the back slot,
otherwise he'll equip it in the offhand and stop dual-wielding.
