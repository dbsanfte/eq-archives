Having those share is a no no. The sound and the vid card should be on
their totally own irq; I even make sure my network card is also on its
own.

If you have a bios like mine it is VERY simple to make sure they are
on their own. What I did was go into my bios in an area called "PNP"
or plug and play. There was a list of Slots or something and by
default it said like ICU or whatever the heck it calls the PNP OS. I
never really knew what that did but one day I changed one and it
turned to "IRQ 5"  EUREKA I SAID! So then I looked in my computer case
and my sound card was in pci slot 2 so I changed that to IRQ 5 (before
it kept trying to get on irq 10 with my graphics card.

Then i just rebooted win98. When I was back in win 98, all of the
soundcard crap like legacy dos irq etc, was all merely on IRQ 5 since
of course that is the only IRQ they could be on since I assigned that
slot to IRQ 5. My network and graphics card were then on IRQs by
themselves by default.

The graphics card is AGP so I could not change the IRQ for it manually
in the bios, but since I could for the other cards It took a free one
;)

There may acutally be a "need" because EQ is not resource friendly and
verant admits this. They suggest you have both the sound and video
fully on their own IRQs or at least on different ones from each other.

However, if you are fine in direct x 7 I don't see how this could be
your problem in dx 8 when you are still using the same IRQs. More
likely its some problem on your type system/graphics card/drivers with
direct x 8 under win 2k. 

If you are not able to change the PCI cards IRQ in the bios, there is
a more cludgey (word? ;) )  way of doing it which you probably can do.
Almost all bioses have a thing that asks if you want to reserve some
IRQ for ISA somewhere. The way I moved IRQs around when desperate on
an older computer was reserve the IRQ, say like 5, reboot into windows
then remove the reserve and reboot again and something like the sound
card would usually fill that 5 then. Or since no IRQ is used with just
the windows PCI VGA graphics driver I don't think, I'd reserve the one
my vid card is on.. like 10 in ISA after switching to windows pci vga
graphics (low color, like 16) Reboot into windows so nothing is now on
10, reboot removing the ISA reserve then select the correct graphics
card and drivers and reboot.
