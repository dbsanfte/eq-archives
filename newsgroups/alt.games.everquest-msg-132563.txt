I have a link to microsoft discussing an issue with AMD problems with an
update you could try:


http://support.microsoft.com/search/preview.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q321178


I just tried the link and it wasn't working, but I know it is a valid link
cause I was there an hour ago.  Maybe it will work later.  Or try searching
microsoft.com.
