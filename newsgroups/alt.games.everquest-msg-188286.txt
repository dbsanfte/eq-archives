As stated in follow-ups this spell is research only, and I spend almost a 
week looking for either the words, or the spell. At the end of the week I 
was level 25, got my ass handed to me, and made a lot of money selling 
Heady Kiola's (around 2K or so) and went on a shopping spree for new gear 
and spells. Hence the 500PP for the spell, it was the only one I've ever 
seen for sale in the Bazaar at Antonius Bayle.

I've been saving ALL words I ever found on mobs, and a lot of spells were 
able to be researched by me, but I *never ever* found the required words on 
mobs :-(
