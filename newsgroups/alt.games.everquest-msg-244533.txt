That's how I'd do it. Store the XP and calculate the level as required.
And then clamp it between 1 and the maximum the player can achieve with
their expansions. If nothing else if copes better with gaining more than
one level at a time (I know it's not possible to do that in the game as
far as I know but you'd want the basic code to cope with it properly)

Assuming they have a set of flags showing what aa abilities are
available to the character, I'd only read the ones that the the
character could possibly have from the database at all. They have the
ability to remove expansions from a player (It's happened to me twice
when they messed up the billing for online expansions) and this makes it
easier to remove the expansion cleanly.
