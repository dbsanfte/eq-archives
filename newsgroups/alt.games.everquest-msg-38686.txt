Roll x y instead of x
if you roll for x, then  a number is generated (randomly) between 1 and
zero. If you roll for x and y then a random number between x and y will be
created.
In any event, you should never roll between 0 and 100. Usually, in my
groups, you ask for random #'s from the group and then you pick a couple of
the numbers to represent x and y. Then everybody picks a target number and
the person closest to the rolled number wins the best loot.
