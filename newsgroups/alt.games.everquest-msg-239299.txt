It seems like they would just have the system page you if theres a problem.
even if the program itself doesnt realize it has crashed (due in part it no
longer running), the OS knows it isnt running anymore and can send out a
page. also, since it takes more than one machine to run an ever quest world,
all machines could be equiped with such technology have a "food chain" of
priority set on them, if one goes down another will page on its behalf.

..on the other hand, if ALL it did was crash, it would just restart on its
own, and send a page or leave a log somewhere that it crashed and restarted,
it would take some kind of actual failure somewhere to have a "problem" and
need emergency attention.
