I've levelled my pally to 22 now and wanted to try to get my Ghoulbane via
the quest only to find it has been broken for the last month or so (the guy
in BB now has a ! in front of his name).

I've poked around but can't seem to find anything posted in a few forums ...
anyone seen or heard 1) why it was taken down, and 2) any ETA on when it
might be fixed?

Just curious ....  thanks!
