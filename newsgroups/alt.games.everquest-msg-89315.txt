Selling banded to other players is a practice near extinction, so we can
count that out.  If your whole purpose for smithing is to make yourself a
suit of banded, it's going to cost you over 200pp for the set, when you
could buy a full set from another smith for about 80pp.  Of course, if you
plan to further your smithing career past banded, none of this is relevant.
