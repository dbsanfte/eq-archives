It makes it so you don't see the headers of a post and delete them
when pulling the headers down. You implement it depending on the
newsreader. In a fairly good one like Agent/Free Agent you just hit
ctrl k then a window pops up where you can pick to kill by subject,
poster, etc. I remember at one time I had an incredibly huge kill file
made up of variations of "make money fast" and "increase your penis
size."

Besides that no archive thing someone mentioned for google (Which I
never knew about, guess I'm still newbish after 20 years of usenet ;)
) some news servers don't keep posts around for as long by default, so
they expire sooner (the person posting might be able to do that too, I
don' t know) I've noticed this in some binary groups where some header
posts there will last a very long time while others will say "no
longer availible" when I go to look at it later.

There are no stupid questions, only stupid suicide bombers.
