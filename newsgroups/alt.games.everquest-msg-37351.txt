Not an exploit. I use it myself to train my begging skill. I do culturar armor,
so spend a lot of time in Kith foraging.
I just go over and hit a bixie with HtH (so i dont kill it), then use it to
train begging. After around 10 min the bixie get bored and go away, i hit it
again.

Now i just need to find a way to stop the helpful warriors that "help" me with
killing my bixie *S*
