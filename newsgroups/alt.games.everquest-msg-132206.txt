After returning 1 1/2 years later, I've got the following 'returning newbie'
questions:

1. Saw a mention of 8 spells per page in the spellbook somewhere.  Is this
false, standard, or available with Luclin?  My pages still have only 5
spells per.

2.  See that some items now have new effects.  By boots and robe for
example.  Are these always active, or do they need to be cast?  Also, any
good sites to explain the different effects and what they do?  Most of the
standard sites don't seem to talk about them too much. Maybe I need to look
harder.

3.  Provided I purchase the expansions, how do you get to Velious?  How do
you get to Luclin?

Thanks
