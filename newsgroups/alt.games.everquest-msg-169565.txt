where to hunt?!

i have a 36 druid, girlfriend has a 37 iksar monk who she worked very
hard with to not be KoS to freeport (have a couple friends near this lvl
killing guards in highkeep).  she eventually wants to get into kelethin.
i think she's nuts, but whatever floats her boat.  so far we've tried
zelniaks in DSP, goblins in SolA (had a bad run of cyans in there, kinda
turned us off to the place), kobolds in SolB, and are currently grinding
our way along with basilisks in JPF.  the basic problem is that i'm
bored.  all these places are okayish xp, but there's just zero challenge
to killing the stuff (wait for her to attack, drones, snare, sit, stand,
heal, sit, move to next mob).

where can we go for some challenging XP that doesn't involve bi-hourly
CRs?  loot's not really an issue, but tailoring supplies (gf wants to
tailor, currently around 115) or acrylia (got another friend working on
fletching, needs acrylia to practice and my ranger gets all the arrows
she makes ;) would be a huge bonus.

as a side note: i also have a 41 enchanter that i actually enjoy
playing, despite somewhat of the same routine as my druid.  if anybody
knows of a good place/strategy i could use to duo that character with my
girlfriend's monk, i'm all ears :D

thanks for any recommendations,
