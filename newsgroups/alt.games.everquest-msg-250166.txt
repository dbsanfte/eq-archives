Your follow up to my post did. My name was the only one you were

However, it's supposed to emulate real life to a certain degree.
What's next, you want to fly around and introduce personal nuclear
weapons because families own them in Dune? Oh, yeah, and I don't
give
a damn about what other games do. Your comment "it's a game," is the
attitude which is making this game the biggest suck ass joke there
is,
on a par with Honkey Dong from fifteen years ago.
Anyway, my comment wasn't to you... I agree with your original
comment, at least as I perceived it, it should be <convenient>,
which
appeared to basically be what <you> were asking for. What was being
suggested was some instant thing to switch back and forth, which,
whether you like it or not, is just stupid, and not in keeping with
the continuity of the game. Gee, the guy can't hit the target, but
he
can change weapons with the agility of a badger, never dropping
anything or missing a beat, in less than a second, while some mob is
beating the crap out of him.. Right.

So yes you did mention one second, in a reply to my post. And I
didn't  'jump in', I started the thread.
