Just about every racial advantage becomes inconsequential with good
equipment. Starting stats are pretty much meaningless (If any matter
more than others, go for Stamina, as strength is almost trivial to
boost via equipment while stamina tends to be much harder). Some
prefer ogres overall because they have the advantage of being
unstunnable from the front (NOTE: this doesn't mean their spells can't
be interrupted, though), others prefer Iksar for their slight AC and
HP regen bonuses. Ultimately, go with whatever race looks best to you.
