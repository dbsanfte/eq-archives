I didn't want to post this in the "Take a look at Shadowbane" thread
because I don't like to encourage spammers but could someome make a
brief summary on how PKing acountability is supposed to work in DAoC
and how it will maybe work in ShadowBane.  (I know how it works in EQ)

I saw bits and pieces in the above mentioned thread and many others,
but a summary would help clear it up for me.  I'd like to try a new
game (No, I'm not leaving EQ, ever!) but PvP hasn't realy proven to be
my bag baby.  Both seem to try to control grief kills but..........
