Yep, I'm noticing that also. My base wisdom is 110, and at level 35 EQDruids 
(go to the Library section), Allakhazam, and Castersrealm all show base mana as 
840. I didn't check Magelo cuz I think I need to log in or something, and I 
don't want to set up an account.

After modifiers my wisdom is 177. EQDruids and Castersrealm show my new mana as 
1309, while Allakhazam shows it as 1379. Not sure if Allakhazam knows something 
the others don't or if they just have it wrong on their side and the others are 
indeed correct. Maybe I'll contact them.
