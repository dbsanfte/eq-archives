Been a while since I've done Vox, but aren't all giant sized (giants,
dragons, generally very tall stuff) mobs immune to stun? The mobs are
interruptable, but that's from physical movement (knockback component of
the spell) rather than the actual stun part which you can interrupt
smaller spellcasters with.

Get your chanters sieving early, and sieve all her mana. Can't CH is she
doesn't have the mana, now can she.
