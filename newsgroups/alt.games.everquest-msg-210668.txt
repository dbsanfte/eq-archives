These are the only two that effect me, but mostly the Client Crash
Information.  I really do hope this helps them because I am still getting
eqgame.exe crashes from time to time and am so goddam sick of them.  I
will not group because I refust to leave a group hanging with a mob as I
go linkdead every 30-45 minutes, thats just rude IMHO.
