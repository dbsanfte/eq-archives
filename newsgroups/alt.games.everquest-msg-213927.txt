    I've since found out a bit more info from the Dev's Chat, so if I know
more I'll mention it below.

    That's all of them. If you talk to the NPCs, you'll apparently be able
to find a trigger phrase that will port your group from one set of NPCs to
another. So no travel risks for evil races, or need for a porting class when
you get tired of dungeon theme X.

    There is a blue line on the compass when you've been given an instance
to explore. It points at the dungeon entry, when you're in the right zone.
The zones with the entry are usually quite close to the zone with the NPCs.

    Sadly, correct. Each casting class supposedly gets eight spells at top
level. For clerics, for example, the spells would be the new group BoR, the
new melee damage rune, the group FR/CR buffs, the detect trap/remove
trap/pick lock spells, and the new low-level remove curse. There are
multiple levels of some spells; for example, there's a level 14, 24, and 34
version of the pick lock spell, each progressively better. But a high level
character is only going to get the best one, so the other two don't really
count.

    The figure I saw in other message board posts was 76 points for "hard"
versus 51 points for "easy", so a 1.5 multiplier. Since they've ramped up
the difficulty of the "easy" and "hard" settings ("easy" mobs for the level
65 group were 500 to 600 quadding, slow-mitigating, and Enraged) I imagine
that's a balanced ratio.

    Sigh. I shouldn't have expected more, but thank you for confirming it. I
wish I could see the things I didn't have the points to purchase, so I could
plan my spending out, but it's not to be. After hearing one tester state
that it would be about 20 adventures at Easy before a Time-capable player
saw anything they'd be interested in, I'd sure like to know what's ahead
before blowing my points.

    Most of the AoE's on Lucy were actually rebalanced nicely. At first,
they were doing flat damage. So break the chest open, everybody eat 4 K DD.
That was very painful for some, and merely a few ticks of downtime to
others. So now many of the "trap" effects deal damage equal to a percentage
of the HPs of the target. Bash open the chest, lose 25% of your HPs.

    One more question: did you ever do a /who all on yourself when you were
in an instance? And if so, what zone name did you appear to be in? I'm
wondering if I can pre-map stuff with Zone Explorer and then do a /who all
me to figure out which map I'm in.

    Thank you for your help!

    James
