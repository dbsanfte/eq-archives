That's the group playing  The Sims...they have a lot of economic power, but
are not interested in the online aspect it would appear.

I played it for about 3 hours on a friend's machine. I'm not a big hero buff
anyway, and it just didn't hook me.
I agree very customizable.

SWG had a lot of customization in it, but everyone seemed to go for the same
15 looks...

Well I have flexibility in FF... I can be the tank (warrior) one week, and
the healer (white mage) the next... if I work at keeping both sets of levels
up. But being a master tank or master healer requires an enormous amount of
work. I was talking (haltingly) with a Japanese Hume player, who is a level
75 Ninja, Dark Knight, White Mage, Black Mage, and Paladin. He also has
every other class at least to level 40. But he's been playing since release,
and is very hard core in his playing (He claimed an overall average of 2.5
hours a day, including when he'd not play for vacations and stuff, since he
started at release)
