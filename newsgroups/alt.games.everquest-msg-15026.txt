Not as redundant as you would think. I have done the druid-ranger combo
and it works quite well, for both. A real nice benifit is you can kite
thru animal infested zones without aggroing the local fauna. Having a
secondary snare capable partner is nice, very nice. Ranger can throw in
extra bow damage while kiting or root-dotting.

I have done the monk-druid combo and it feels nowhere near as
complementary as druid-ranger. I would imagine that shadowknight-druid
would be fun. I have done druid-enchanter, very nice combo, one of my
personal favorites.
