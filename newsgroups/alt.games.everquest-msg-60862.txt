My first character (Dwarven Paladin).  Also my highest (now Level 40).
It takes a LOT of work to get a Paladin up in levels sometimes.

Coincidence:  When I hit Level 7, I successfully soloed my first ever
Giant Scarab.  It dropped the rare Pristine Scarab Carapace.  I had it
turned into armour (quest in Kaladim).  I still have that BP sitting
in the bank.

Well, if you really want:

Fuck off!

Quit playing!

Quit whining!

Thy visage is most unseemly, and thy mother doth costume thee in most
peculiar wise!

Those do?

For a change, try starting a Barbarian Shaman in Halas.  Everfrost is
the only Human / Barbarian / Erudite newbie zone where you can
actually see easily at night.  Plus, Shamans get useful starting
spells to cut downtime.

(The first-level Inner Fire spell is an AC buff and a 10-HP heal.
It's actually one of the most mana-efficient low-level healing spells
in anybody's arsenal, if you've got time to cast it again and again.
It beats the actual low-level healing spell that Shamans also get.)
