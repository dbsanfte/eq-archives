If I couldn't trust them to uphold my guilds good name, and conduct
themselves in an appropriate manner when playing, I wouldn't allow them in.

We all make mistakes from time to time, but I wouldn't call screaming for
help and then running away from the fight while my helper died a mistake...
I'd call it shitty gameplay. That's just how I see things though, and what
the hell do I know :)
