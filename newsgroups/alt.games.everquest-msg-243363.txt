Extremely short version for those who don't like to read long winded crap:

1. What early portions of the quest can definitely be skipped and still 
have it work ok?
2. What factions for the various early mobs are "must have" and which 
mobs/factions are they? (By "must have" I mean, is there a usable 
workaround for ones you are KOS to?)
3. Is just killing Bregun Dorey sufficient to kick it off and does he 
give a faction hit?

More thorough version...

We're killing Seru fairly regularly and I may have a pretty good chance 
at all the "hard to get" parts of this quest, including Seru's head, so 
I thought I would start it. However, it's got a lot of steps and much 
conflicting information has been published about it.

Early parts: I've read comments online from some people saying you 
*MUST* do every single step of the quest or the next mob won't spawn, 
etc.  Other reports say you can start by just handing in the drink to 
Legionaire Dalini and getting Bregun to spawn. Yet another said that if 
you kill Bregun, he'll *drop* the bixie charm you need for the next 
step. I've been told killing the guards outside MS will result in Dalini 
eventually spawning on his own, but others say he must be spawned by the 
previous step. Because of possible faction issues (below) I'd like to 
cut as much of this off as possible. Can I start this quest further 
along than the beginning?

Faction issues: We've not only killed Seru multiple times, but spent 
time clearing the vamp castle in TM repeatedly. As such, I think I'm max 
ally in Katta, and there are wanted posters up for me in every post 
office in Sanctus Seru and MS. I'm guessing Legionaire Dalini will be 
KOS to me, since he's an MS guard? How about the spawned Bregun? Is he 
on any faction? And the two guys in Sanctus Seru... Torsten and Euzan. 
I'm hoping they are spies on Katta faction instead of Seru faction or 
I'm definitely screwed. Is that right? For the ones that I *must* do 
turnins with, etc. (without having somebody else do them, charm them, 
wolf form, or whatever) is there a workaround or am I stuck killing a 
billion of something for faction?

Any help most appreciated.
