Oh please. Basic travel to help people get around is a nice feature
FOR EVERYONE! I have a druid and I welcome the change.

Some of us have lives and want to PLAY the game not stand around
waiting for a boat or a dude in a dress to port me to the moon.

People say this takes income from druids or wizards. Speaking as
a druid I never wanted to be a taxi cab anyway good riddance!

"So what are you going to do tonight in EQ? Slay a dragon?
Challenge a god? Explore a dungeon? Rescue the Princess?"

/em stares at the ground and kicks some dirt.

"Err um no I was going to port people around to make cash
for some new shoes"

"Wow sounds exciting. No wonder you like this game!"
