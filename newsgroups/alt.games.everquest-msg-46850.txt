Combination of information given out to my brother's unit in Desert Storm,
knowledge of some pretty violent chemical agents, and basic understanding
of the effects of the most likely used chemical agents.

"Do you believe that you could stab an injection of Atropine into yourself 
in the few seconds that you have before a chemical agent stops the
production of neural chemicals in your brain", is what I'm essentially
summarizing. I know I couldn't and I'm willing to bet that I'm sitting in
the majority.

Atropine is only going to help those who don't die at ground zero of a
chemical attack or have strong systems. The average person is most likely
going to eat it before they can even get the needle into their hands.

The average acting time on most extremely deadly chemical agents, to my
knowledge, is within 30 seconds to 1 minute. And that time is not one that
could be said to be conducive to the self injection of anything.

Just curious where the lecture was held, actually. =) My chemistry
professor used to tell us great stories about the "Fun uses of
chemistry" when he'd get back from his advisory council.
