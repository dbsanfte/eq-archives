No.  
Your whole argument is based on your definition of kill stealing and
that the CoH customer support should recognize YOUR definition, not
Cryptic's.

The less than 5% came straight from the devs.
Not exactly hard to come by  #forum registrations/# CoH registrations.

The .01% is admittedly an estimation based on my daily reading of the
forums since May 6th.   I actually did/do read the kill stealing posts.

For the most part it's the SAME people over and over again [there's a
bunch of poster who will post the same crap to every thread of a
particular topic.]

That, combined with a healthy dose of people who have come from another
game that actually ALLOWED the stealing of exp, and are using that other
game's definition of kill stealing.

Just like you.  

Those people either get a clue, read the rules and stop complaining
about something that's not against the rules, or, like you, they insist
that it's a problem because they say it's a problem.

There's more people on the forums complaining that the smoke grenade Fix
was really a nerf than have ever complained about kill stealing.

You're the one trying to force CoH to follow EQ's definition of kill
stealing, even though the mechanics don't support the actual theft of
exp.

All you're really saying is: You can't be bothered learning what the
actual rules are and want CoH to act just like EQ so you don't have to.

You have only to look in the mirror.
