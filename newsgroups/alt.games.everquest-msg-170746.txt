I would contend that it occurs due to the game mechanics of Everquest being
much less "roleplayer friendly."   Camping, and respecting other people's
camps... killing the same NPC over and over again until he finally drops the
rare quest piece that you need to continue.   None of these things really
makes much sense from a roleplaying point of view, but in many cases it is
what the game requires.

It has since been modified... but I'd point out that for over two of the
three (and a half) years the game has been up and running, in order for a
paladin to get his first "Holy Sword" and one of the first steps of his epic
weapon quest... that paladin had to camp and kill another paladin, of a
non-aggressive race.  (no paladins in the game start below dubious to Guk
frogloks)

Necromancers, even those that worship Cazic Thule, must kill (first him, now
his golems) in plane of Fear in order to get the slime blood needed to
complete thier classes epic.  Innoruuk worshiping SK's must kill hundreds if
not thousands of ashenbone drakes in Plane of Fear before they get the part
they need.   Warriors, even those that do not worship Rallos Zek, have the
god's avatar tell them that they are the very persona of his ultimate
worshiper, bestow upon them his ultimate weapon, (which really isn't all
that ultimate) The Jagged Blade of War.

And if you want to complete these hard quests, and overcome extremely hard
opponents, you need the support of every class.  Even those played by the
"filthy dark elves".   If you don't have a necromancer to summon corpses,
your paladin's sky raid will be a *major* pain in the ass.   Same as if you
exclude all those bloodthirsty Rallos Zek worshiping warriors from the raid.
Oh, and your character doesn't really like wizads, so you can't even get
ported to the zone to start the raid!


I don't know enough about DAoC to say if it is better for this or not...  so
I won't really comment on that.
