You'll be able to walk through parts of Kael in Velious.  Plus there are the
catacombes in Qeynos and the under ground tunnels in FP.

My troll is warmly in Firiona Vie (hehe) you don't see many trolls there.
I'm also ok in Qeynos after spending some time in Black Burrow. So you can
work on faction as you do your XP grind and make so you can go into other
cities.
