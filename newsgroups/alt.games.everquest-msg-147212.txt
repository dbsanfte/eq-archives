It's a matter of mana/time effeciency.  I have found it to be more
mana effecient to quad since lvl  34 up to to current lvl 38.
Especially at the lower end of this scale.

For example, at level 34, when I started experimenting, it took me
almost 1/2 my mana to kill a single Uthork Hunter. Therefor I could
kill 2 hunters safely with a complete mana bar.  Quad kiting allowed
me to kill 4 hunters with the same mana bar.

Therefore I killed two extra mobs for the same amount of mana and med
time.   Woot !!

The down time is that, phsycologically,  the time it takes to med back
a full mana bar compared to half seems more like tripple the wait
time,  despite what the logic of math tells you.
