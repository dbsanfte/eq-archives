Nothing wrong with soloing at all
I like the fact you set your own pace.
Can do it without waiting or relying on others etc.
As someone who hates the fact that this game so much of your time to get 
anywhere in the game i appreciate anything i can do to level faster and 
this involves grouping at certain stages.
I have gotten my druid to level 22 very fast compared to how long it 
took with my wiz, although of course part of that is cause my wiz was my 
first char, but you learn the mobs to hit and when to group to speed 
things up.
But if your happy with soloing thats cool but i have found with the 
frustration i went through with my wiz at certain levels i often was 
going to quit the game, the only thing that kept me in the game with a 
great guild with people who want to help you in quests and epics and its 
been so much fun.
As a level 26 paladin you have yet to experience the slowdown in 
levelling that seemed to start for me at 35.
You may yet change you mind about soloing once you start taking a week 
to get 1 level which happens from level 50s apparently.
But whatever you do, as long as its fun thats all that matters
