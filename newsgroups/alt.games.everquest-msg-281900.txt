This doesn't happen with me at all though I use NVidia cards.  It
sounds more like video driver issue rather than game issue.  If I used
/exit to get out of EQ quickly, the gamma setting doesn't revert to
default at all so everything's too bright afterward.

I do have an annoying and reproduceable issue: when I change between
windowed mode and full screen mode, the plane clip gets reset to zero
regardless of the setting on the slider.  Touch the slider and the
clip goes back to the way it should be.  This happened through 3
different NVidia cards and 2 years worth of drivers.
