Well, that figures!  My monk just finished camping his epic piece
in Karnor's (drolvarg pawbuster in Warlord room); about 40 hours
worth.  So if I'd just waited I could've gotten hot-zone XP for it?
Oh well, I'm just glad I'm done!

And on the plus side, I noticed that Gunthak used to be a hotzone,
so it's a happy coincidence that we went there last night working
on our cleric's Pure Blood quest.

Not just their owners; the bard in my group uses Eye of Zomm and it
has often attacked the cleric or me if we were sitting nearby when
he brought it up.  Indeed, last time I saw it happen, it attacked me
and my pet then killed the Eye!  (It's nice to see one of the bugs I
reported actually get fixed.  Not that I'm claiming to be the only
one who reported it.)

So does this mean that, all those times that I see:
   The Universal Chat service is temporarily unavailable.  You will
   be notified when it is restored.
it will now affect more than just cross-server chat?  Will it affect
other channels such as guild-chat?
