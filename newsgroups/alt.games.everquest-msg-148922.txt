Ok if the theory that sony (EQ1)is near its end and that Everquest 2 is near
its genius.Then they should kill us all off(instead of " wishing us
away").But with a fighting chance.There should be a cataclysm ...a great
dragon that sweeps through Nariak killing all in its path ...it would be
called (IMHO)"Cataclysm".It should take 90% of  the population in its first
sweep.All high level toons would be hiding on other planes(if they were
smart).Don't worry if your low level(your not going to survive anyway).But
the 60 lev toons should battle this beast on Nariak.It could be the end all
and be all of all raids.Guilds would get together just to stop it., but at
the end of "Cataclysm's" Furry would be devastating and only a handful would
be there to tell the story.And they will be gods in EQ2.
