Odds are, if they invited you, they also included you in that notion of "a
great bunch of people".

See previous comment on "great people". Apparently, they liked you. It may
be that they found you to be fun, or it may be that they found you to be a
good player or both. Understand that "good player" is not the same thing as
"experienced player" - it can mean simply that, for someone of your level in
your class, you seem to be doing OK, that you *listen* (which means you'll
get much better skill wise), etc..

Being in a *good* guild will likely very much speed your growing and
learning process. You'll find that you'll get exposed to much more (when a
guild mate is working on some quest or otherwise dealing with their own
issues, but share it with you), plus you'll have people that can give
contrustive suggestions.

Yes, it varies - WIDELY. Many high level raiding guilds have a philosophy
that says "If you're on, you RAID". There are even some guilds that have
minimum hour expectations per week/day - these are very much the exception
rather than the rule though. You'll find lots of guilds that are more
"family" style, and are about relationships. You'll also find what I call
"dead guilds" - guilds that are still together, but offer no value other
than the name tag - these usually do little together and say virtually
nothing in guild chat.

With the exception of a few folks paying for EQ off of unemployment or
disability pay, most everyone else does have SOME (albeit small in some
cases) life outside of EQ. Whether it be classes they need to attend, or
their own job, folks do have other things that they need to do. You're need
to do other things during the day is in no way unique - if it was a problem
for most guilds, there wouldn't be many guilds.

It's also not something to take lightly. You should look for a group of
people that you can feel committed to, and that you think will be committed
to you. The nature of that commitment varies - it may be "showing up for
raids", or it may be just help and support - the occasional CR, or whatever.

Get to know your would be guildies. Remember, guilds are usually -
expecially at your level - about relationships. Think of it like a wedding
in America today - it's not like you can't get a divorce, but you also want
to know a bit about who your marrying before you say "I Do". You don't want
a reputation for guild hopping just like you don't want to have to talk
about your 15 prior spouses - folks will stop dealing with you figuring that
you are not someone that they can count on to tough things out when times
are tough (and most guilds go through tension periods at times - some a LOT
more than others).


Hope this help!
