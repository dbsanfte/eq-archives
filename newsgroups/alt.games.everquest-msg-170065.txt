Like I said, just because *your* monk could solo drolvargs, doesn't mean all
monks can (and all warriors can't)
Twinked characters shouldn't be used to argue the relative strengths of
chars.. but everybody did just that when it comes to monks.

I could make a bard, and melee (no kiting or fearing) upto 50 with zero
problems.. I could do the same with a warrior or rogue.. no it doesn't mean
the class is too strong.. it just means twinked chars are too strong..

People would say "well the only reason you could solo as a warr/rogue is
because you were twinked!"  - hey guess what.. the only reason a monk can
really solo is because they were twinked.   Overpowered my ass !
