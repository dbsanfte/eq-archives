...Im surprised noone said Gormit yet. It's a named hill giant in OOT. Drops
around 40pp and fine steel weapons. Also It's a camp....so once you have
him...you have him till your done. Also within range are seafury
cyclops....drops about 5pp but the gems they drop range from 50-90pp. 
You can make close to 500pp-1500pp(gems can make you a pooload of cash) per
hour by killing Gormit and pulling seafuries while you wait on gormit to spawn.

Gormits hps are close to 1500ish and hits for about 70ish max. Seafuries have
about 2500hps and hit for 80ish.

 Also in range is a spawn for the oracle robe. Maybe sells for 100pp-400pp
depending on your server ect.

 I am also a Shaman and have leveled from 48-52 here. If you plan on soloing
here dont go for the seafuries unless you have a JBB. I have earned 5-10kpp in
one sitting here. One sitting meaning about 3-6hours.
 I would also recommend having someone mule your items to sell...either make a
chanter and twink it to the hilt with cha to sell in OOT to the sisters.

anyhow good luck


The dumber people think you are, the more suprised they're going to be when you
kill them. Clutch6
