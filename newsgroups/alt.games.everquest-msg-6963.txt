Yes, but even aside from the exchange rate, computer
equipment in Canada seems to have a bigger markup than it
does in the US.  I'm not sure whether it's the higher taxes,
or increased shipping costs (probably both), but I've been stunned
by the prices of some standard computer equipment (and even computer
games) that my Canadian friends have had to shell out.
