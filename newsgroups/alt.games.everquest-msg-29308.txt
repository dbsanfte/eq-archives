The program was written in modules...one group of programmers created
Butcherblock Mountains, another created Greater Faydark, for example.  Those
to map areas abut one another, and to get from one to the other you have to
go to the zone line, and while "zoning" it's removing one zone from memory
and adding the other.  This can take from 30 seconds to a minute and is
often annoying to new players.  The upside to this is that if you're trying
to escape death by combat, the zone line is 99.9% the best way to do it.

You MUST understand that meleers are meleers and casters are casters.  There
are some melee/caster hybrids, but the current hybrids (new one slated for
December, and although I'm willing to bet it'll be the same, I don't KNOW)
can't take the punishment that true "tanks" can, and their spells aren't
that good (IMO).  Your best bet is to just investigate all classes and see
which one best suits you.  On most servers you get 8 character slots, so
create lots of different classes if you can't settle on one.

No clue where you heard that, but it's untrue.  EQ is $9.89/mo if you pay
monthly ($25.89 quarterly is what I pay, and there's a 6-mo plan but I don't
know the price).
