I think all mobs should spawn randomly (preferably out of sight of the
players) and them make it's way to it camp site. Also the original
vision called for people to be fighting groups of mobs at a time. That
would be made much more possible, if each "camp site" attracted one
named (difficult mob) and a number of followers (lower con mobs). So
these mobs spawn randomly, so if someone is sitting on the camp site,
they will see the mobs come streaming in from around them, and if they
are making their way to the camp site before it has been broken, they
see a boss mob with his henchmen around him.

It just really doesnï¿½t seem that hard to implement. Well, except for
the abysmal pathing in some zones...
