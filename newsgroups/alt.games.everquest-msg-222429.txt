I have recently been killed twice while climbing up and over the hill that
looks down onto the poachers camp. Same place.  A GM got my body back (it
was totally gone!).  The game locks up and you return to bind point nekked
with no body atop the hill. I reported the /bug.  Wondered if anyone else
ran into that mess?
