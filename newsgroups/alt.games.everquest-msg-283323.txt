I decided to try their live chat support this time, and managed to get
some more info, after which I dug back through the 35-page thread on
the SOE forums about this and found much the same info.  Here's the
content of that post.  The short answer is, (a) they're saying it depends
on whether you subscribed during the anniversary (which should have been
a recurring subscription price of $99.99) or in the month that followed
(during which they say they were offering a one-year sub for $99.99 but
it reverts to the current yearly rate after that), and (b) if you're in
the first category, they're working on setting up a way to get us back
on the special rate and will be sending email once it's ready.  That
post was just 2 days ago so I guess I'll wait a while longer before I
bug them some more.  (Good thing my main's a monk; we learn patience!)

	-- Don.

Hello all,

Just another quick status update and a new ETA (as the last one was obviously wrong.)

To avoid confusion, I'm going to start by describing the complete billing history in the matter (with dates and figures,) move on to describing what exactly the bug on SOE's side was, and then outline how the fix was implemented. I'll then go on to describe a few sample scenarios that should address any related questions.

Billing History:

6 Year Anniversary Promo: Between April 11th and May 11th of 2005 a special promotional subscription plan was offered. This was a recurring plan at $99 for a year of service. Keep in mind that when I refer to the billing bug in our system later on, it is only in relation to this plan. This will show up as "6 Year Anniversary Plan."

Interim Pricing Plan: Between May 12th and June 11th of 2005 there was an interim plan offered - just before a scheduled and announced price increase. The then current price for a 1 year subscription was $119. During this interim period the 1 year subscription would cost $99, afterwards it would revert to the regular yearly price - which was soon to be $143.99. This will only show up as a regular subscription.

Price Increase: On June 12th of 2005 the yearly subscription price changed to $143.99.

The 6 Year Anniversary Renewal Bug:

The renewal bug occurred between April 11th and May 16th of 2006. Anyone who's 6 year promo subscription came up for renewal in that time period would close automatically, with information in our system seeming to suggest an error with the customer's credit card. The culprit was later discovered to be a faulty setting on our billing server.

The Solution:

The solution implemented is a 3 part process.

1) Fix the subscription: Completed May 16th 2006. After this was repaired all 6 year anniversary subscriptions would renew normally. Also, since this is a recurring charge if your credit card date expired (but your card was reissued with a new date,) you should renew with no problems.

2) Fix the people who closed and resubscribed to a year: Completed May 31st 2006. If you resubbed at the normal yearly rate after closing due to the 6 year anniversary promo bug, we performed the following actions to your account:

    * Refunded the difference between the 1 year price and the 6 year promo ($44.99.)
    * Put you back on the 6 year anniversary promo plan.
    * Granted you 30 days to compensate you for our error and the inconvenience it caused.

This part of the fix for closed accounts was implemented first as it was both legally and operationally the easiest to provide.

3) Fix everyone else who closed due to the 6 year anniversary promo renewal bug. ETA Thursday June 8th, 2006. This is currently being QA'ed (I think everyone can appreciate the need for that - afterall, we don't want any new mistakes made. :smileyvery-happy The estimate is just that: an estimate. It may change depending on what errors are found and how long it takes to fix them. This fix will apply to all accounts who closed due to the 6 year promo renewal bug, regardless of if they resubscribed to any of our subscription plans, consumed a game card, were granted compensation time by customer service, or even if they subscribed on a regular yearly plan AFTER May 31st (when the 2nd part of the fix was implemented.)

This fix is currently planned to include the following:

    * An email to every customer affected. (So make sure your email is up to date!)
    * A special web page that only people affected by the bug can sign in to, which grants access to a new subscription sign up page.
    * A process that will refund the last charge made.
    * The process will put you back on the 6 year promo.
    * The process will also give you 30 free days to compensate you for our error.

Details are subject to change, but that's how I currently understand it will work.

Sample Scenarios:

Your 6 year promo closed between April 11th 2006 and May 16th 2006: Congratulations (er, I mean, sorry,) you were a victim of the 6 year promo renewal bug. See the above detailed fix for information on how we have or how we intend to sort you out. Also, if you're currently closed, contact CS or me and we'll give you some time until the fix goes live.

Your plan renewed at $143.99 without you resubscribing or changing your billing information: It sounds like you were on the interim pricing plan, and this was the intended behavior of the plan. If you're looking for a better deal you may wish to check out the 2 year subscription, which is currently $199. Also while I'm not promising anything at all, there's a chance we might have similar promos in the future.

Your 6 year promo closed AFTER May 16th 2006: I hate to say it but it seems like there could have been a problem with your card or bank account. You might wish to check out the 2 year subscription, which is currently $199. And also, while I'm STILL not promising anything at all, there's a chance we might have similar promos in the future.

You are on the 6 year promo plan and due to renew but your credit card expiration date has changed: If your expiration date has changed you should renew without incident due to the nature of recurring charges.

You are on the 6 year promo plan, but your credit card number or account has closed or changed significantly: Unfortunately there seems to be no way to keep you on the 6 year promo. With that having been said there is the 2 year plan (which is currently $199.) Also, and I'm STILL not promising anything, there is a chance we might have similar promos in the future.

I hope this clears up some confusion - let me know if you have further questions or concerns. Also if you've sent me mail or PMs recently and have not had a response, I'm working on getting to your emails and PMs - either myself or Geoff (my senior tech,) will get back to you.
