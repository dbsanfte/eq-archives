I think Brad's done a great job with EQ, but I think he's way out of
touch here.

If I had to spend weeks working my way up through bats, rats, spiders,
wolves, skeletons, zombies, orcs, and all the other critters newbies
get to fight, I would never start a new character. If I didn't have
something to do with the equipment that drops when my necromancer
groups, I would never play him. If it weren't for the ability to
twink, I would have lost interest in this game when I discovered how
non-essential my high-level necromancer was. Within my immediate
circle of friends, more than half have found starting twinks to
breathe new life into the game when the guild-oriented game became too
melodramatic.

If Brad had spent more time fixing this "problem," I think most of us
would have grown tired of this game by now and moved on to other
pursuits.
