    It's more than that, although that is something else I do - make the "he
must live, so you're cut off" decisions. I view each person's health
mentally as a status, almost - "fine", "acceptably injured", "not going to
die", "elf needs heals, badly!" In general, if anyone slips into "needs
heal", they get a heal. With Celestial Elixir, I've found I cast CE, and
then "forget" about the person because they'll be fine, even if they're
getting beat on. Whereas normally if folks were getting beat on that
shouldn't I might wade in with a stun or a root, or watch their health more
actively.

    After a while, you get a very strong feel for who will save you and who
won't, and the decisions become automatic. But the first time you allow
someone to die so the group can survive isn't fun.
