Ok, for those of you on the 7th Hammer Server, running around WC and EC and
notice there is more wind than usual, its because I am out there swinging
around and missing alot. I'm a L9 pally. I have a weapon that does decent
damage, my problem is that I just miss alot. I have trained the 1H slash a
bit when I was lower and that is my primary weap. I forget what my skill in
it is. My DEX is 85. What can I do to improve my "To Hit"? I was thinking I
need to get my DEX up higher, but I don't know of any buffs that will do
that. What items can I get that will help with my To Hit or DEX? I think I
could do better solo'ing if I could just connect with my target more often.
Thank for any advice!
