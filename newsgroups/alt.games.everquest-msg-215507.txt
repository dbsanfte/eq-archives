Ah, the trouble is, it's certainly possible that some of the words you use
were new in your parent's day and they cringe or grind THEIR teeth any time
you use it.  Of course, 42 says that he sees nothing wrong with the word.
You said the buzzword started in the early 80s.  It's quite possible it
pre-dates 42 (or, like he said, there's no other word that IS more concise)
so to him it's an old, established word.

You ended your post with a preposition, you heathen!
