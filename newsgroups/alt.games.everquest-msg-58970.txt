As a ranger this brings up my question.  If you have no chanter, and there's
more than one mob and the rooted one comes loose it invariably ends up on the
shaman / druid / wizard.  Shouldn't it be someones (mine?) job to stop
attacking mob #1 and try to get mob #2 off the caster?  And shouldn't the group
leader designate this responsibility?
