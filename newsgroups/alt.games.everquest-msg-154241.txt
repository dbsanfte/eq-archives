OK, TS under ideal circumstances aside, I  meant via melee.  Heck, I
can probably outdamage your monk in ideal circumstances for a while too,
by nuking undeads.  You do mention sustainable, which shoots that
arguement down, of course.  But TS isn't melee damage really, any more
than a bard singing DOT songs is (although both are sustainable)

All of which is very nice and all, but makes no point.  I've been to the
top of the eiffle tower, says Fran.  Oooh, ah, but do you have a point?

Do you contend that monks take more HP in damage per minute than
warriors, in a sustained fashion?    Running a botted cleric chealing
away on your guild's plan doesn't really impress me much, have
you watched to see whats really going on?  If so, then do tell.  Otherwise
I'll suspect that you are merely parroting recieved wisdom.   I do
the same to some extent, so getting down to cases can convince
me to change my mind... but the word of a botter doesn't hold
much sway with me, I'll need evidence before I buy your say-so
over what looks very much like the truth to my personal experience.

Oh, and as supporting character witness, I present to you the good
folks at Verant, who may have their heads up their asses as to
what a good solution might be, but who have identified the very same
phenomena I'm expounding upon, without any help from me.
Indepentant verification of claims by people I have every reason
to suspect have access to actual data, instead of a body of "hmm,
looks that way to me" anecdotal evidence like I'm using.

You've missed the entire point of this aside.  I put that unless in
to shore up the arguement by noting its exception explicitly.  A
very well equipped monk has HP on the order of an averagely
equippped warrior.... but that oddball combo aside,

It isn't, but thats just evidence that CHeal is a balance breaking
spell.  At any rate, pre 50 CHeal sucks, and druids and shaman
do not have CHeal (incomplete isn't the same thing at all) so there
are quite a few circumstances where CHeal isn't available.

CHeal costs 400 mana to heal up to 10K hp.  ER costs 400
mana to heal roughly 1023 HP.  If you don't have at least
1023 damage, ER is just as efficient and far faster... and thats
without AA or focus to make ER more efficient and faster.
ER is also one of the least efficient heals a cleric has, just the one
I though of first off.

10%, 15%, is not SIGNIFICANTLY.. its not even significantly (no caps)
its noticably but its not astounding.

Defense of a warrior, HP of a monk... you make my point for me.  Warriors
don't have the defense skills of a monk, and monks don't have the HP of
a warrior.  This is like me saying my cleric is an excellent tank because he
can absorb damage like a beastlord and deal damage like a warrior!

Further, rogues only get to sponging level because of the stupidity of
the AC cap, warriors with hundreds more AC than comperable rogues
are nonetheless nerfed down to rogue effectiveness by the soft cap.

Again, broken class at the high equipment end, with a chain class
up at the effective armor cap.  Rangers should not be effective
sponges, that they are for some uberguild members is a sad sad
thing.  I'd still rather have a monk MA than a ranger MA, similarly
equipped, the monk is going to take less damage.

Ten percent less isn't on the order of a warrior, who does 50%
less.  OK, so its less, consistently enough that you can point
to it and rely on it.  Its still the ballpark, you'll happily take
three monks and three rogues instead of holding out for 6 monks,
but 3 rogues and 3 warriors represent substantially less damage.

Yes, someone in plate should tank better than someone in a
tshirt.  Sponge better, I should say, because Tank is one
of those mixed meanings words.

If monks should be able to stand up to mobs at all, it should
be by avoiding their blows, not by sucking up that solid
hit from a two handed sword or letting the jaws of that
dragon close around their midsections.

Having the same effective AC as a plate clad person while
at the same time avoiding far more blows in the first place
defies logic, both from a game standpoint and from a
"mirror of real life" standpoint.

Care to try it?  Put on a nice set of biker leathers and
let me hit you with a baseball bat a few times.  To remove
the effect of monk dodging around, you'll have to promise
to stand still.  I'll put on a set of plate and let you do the
same, and I'll let you have the first three swings.  I'll still
be standing after that, and I'll gaurantee you'll be asking
me to stop after the first one, if you can talk at all.  Why?
Because plate mail is good armor, it distributes the force
of the blow as well as deflecting it.  This example isn't
even close to fair, because plate is best at turning narrow
impacts into distributed impacts, a sword or teeth would
be far more affected by plate than a blunt instrument.  But
if I hit you with the sword you'd be dead, and I think thats
going to far even in a hypothetical example like this.

I know, you are going to point out that this is a fantasy
environment, in which that leather bomber jacket is
constructed of dragon hide and magically enhanced... but
the plate would also then be constructed of similarly improved
fantastic materials and magical enhancements.  For some
reason, these enhancements in EQ go up to a point and
then stop, while monk (and rogue and ranger) enhancements
keep on climbing till they are on the same par.

Clerics and bards should not be as good at sponging as
warriors or shadowknights or paladins... but they should
be noticably better than rogues or rangers.  Monks might
arguably be candidates for better sponging... but only
insofar as they avoid getting hit, not because their armor
is just as good as the cleric's.  EQ carefully models this thru
the lower levels and with monk equipment; they don't
get a whole Brell of a lot of damage mitigation but they make
up for it to some extent with damage avoidance.  Then
this whole equation gets tossed in the dustpan when AC
stops being different for the different melee classes.  Getting
hit less often for the same damage, only thing keeping monks
from being the ultimate sponge is HP totals, and apparantly
this too is eclipsed at the high end, with monks getting to
within a stone's throw of warrior HP.

With the new nerf of CHeal and the added HP capabilities
PoP presents, all you need is at least 8500 hp to be just
as good at sucking up CHeals as a warrior... those extra
1500 hp a 10,000 hp warrior might have won't mean
much since he can't get healed that much anyway, we are
back to the sub-50 game where people who take fewer
HP in damage per minute are preferable to those who
have a more massive HP base to absorb damage with.
Warriors, I contend, should firmly hold that place with
pride... its all they bloody well have, after all, and monks
with FD and much better damage output shouldn't be
a contender for taking that title away from the poor guys.
(nor should rangers or rogues, mind you, classes this
fix does nothing to cure of spongly ambitions)
