Forget soloability, even killing orange mobs almost non-stop the exp
doesn't even come close to fighting in a group.
On the other hand, because of the way EQ2 has things, forget the
enchanter "functionality" from old EQ.  When a puller selects a target
it will show exactly what and how many mobs will come, as opposed to
EQ1 where you never knew, and thus, you wanted to have an enchanter for
the tough fights.  I've played both enchanter and magician in EQ2
(coercer and conjuror). Personally I like the conjuror better.
