 Bracer of uh.. Something.. I think it's a dwarf quest or maybe the
gnome pirate guys. It has a 12pt DD damage right clicky. I don't know if
it's insta-cast but I would think so.

 Bracer of the Hidden - Insta-cast see invis

 earring from Grachnist - insta-cast Grim Aura

 Jboots - insta-cast sow

 frost giant beards/dwarf beards - Insta-cast str buff - 5 charges

 coldain ring quest > 8 (maybe 7 can't recall) - insta-cast damage
shield

 
 That's all I can remeber off the top of my head.
