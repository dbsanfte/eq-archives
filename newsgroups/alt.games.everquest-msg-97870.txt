I still wish CRs were optional.  That is, I wish you could take
an *extra* experience hit if you choose not to CR, but have your
corpse teleported to you for easy looting.  Something to that
effect, anyway.

The reason I wish for that is because I don't mind spending the
*time* to make up for my death, but sometimes I don't have the
time *right now* to CR, and may not have the time for several
days.

It happened to me (again) just last night.  I was soloing aviaks
in SK and a skeletal cyclops came out of nowhere and whacked me
instantly.  My spouse says, "Okay, as soon as you're done with
that last kill, lets go to bed."  And, as usual, I had to reply
(embarassed), "I just died.  I have to recover my corpse first."

I suspect *many* older gamers (who are married) could tell
similar stories.  This isn't a problem with younger and/or
unmarried folks, of course.  But believe me when I tell you
that spouses *do* get upset when you have to tell them to
wait for a half an hour while you recover your corpse.

I'm not sure when I'll get to play again.  It may not be until
the weekend, and frankly, I don't trust Verant's corpse decay
timers.  So I'm forced to spend the time *right now* to get my
corpse.  I wish I could just summon my corpse and take a nice
big experience hit for doing that.
