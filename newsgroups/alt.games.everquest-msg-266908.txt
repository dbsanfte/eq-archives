Could very well be. But that would mean that evolution is not a function 
of 'random mutation'... if the mutations are triggered its not 'random'.

This hypothesis at least should be testable on bacteria.

The 'theory of evolution' in its current form uses natural selection as 
-the mechanism-. They aren't separate. 

I guess if you insist on separating them I'm going to have to go with 
the more specific "natural selection". But I strongly object that you 
should be separating them.

Given that I've distanced myself repeatedly from creationist arguments 
here, can we accept that I'm not arguing that evolution doesn't occur, 
that simply the current theory on 'how and why it occurs' is wrong.

To switch this to a physics context, we're looking at Newtonian physics 
and I've just said Newtonian physics is inadequate. And you've countered 
with with: well its either physics or magic. Either objects move in 
relation to each other according to phycis whatever the 'laws', or its 
all just voodoo magic.

I've never said lets abandon the idea of physics, I just said Newton's 
physics aren't adequate. Similiarly, the current 'theory of evolution' 
is inadequate, perhaps even outright wrong. That doesn't mean evolution 
isn't occuring, it just means evolution isn't occuring by random 
mutation+natural selection.

Organisms evolve. I think we agree on that. I'm not arguing against the 
'idea of evolution'. I'm arguing against the 'theory of evolution'.

The 'theory of evolution' is more than just a formal statement of 
'organisms evolve'. The theory must explains how and it does: random 
mutation + natural selection. 

But its not right, we know its not right, it fails to explain far too 
much. It -might- be on the right track, but it might be dead wrong. We 
know evolution occurs, but our 'theory of evolution' might be way off 
base describing how it happens. Similiarly Newtonian physics was pretty 
good, we still use it extensively, despite its limitations... but 
newtonian physics got some fundamental stuff dead wrong... and it has 
since been replaced.
