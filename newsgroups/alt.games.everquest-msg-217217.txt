So, it's not my imagination that specs are finally dropping through
the floor?  Got Girdle of Magi'Kot today for 3k and Malosinia on a
turn in.

Now, if only Sun Vortex (rune) would drop from 40k :)  

If we keep doing as well as we did last night though, I'll probably 
get it on a turn in.  We started assembling at just after 4 and had
finished the last BoT tower boss at just after 8.

2 ornate BP molds
1 ornate chain bp
1 ornate silk pattern
2 nice caster secondaries (I ended up with orb of the stormwatcher :)
1 Paladin only 1hs (kind of a booby prize for us, all our paladins
have one now :)
1 SK only 2hp (had to turn that one open to prospects to bid on)

3 runes/3 specs.

The dang earth boss didn't drop any parchments (the cheapskate) 

By replacing my Stave of Wit and Summoned focus earing with
Wand of Cursed Souls, Orb of the Stormwatcher and a Sinew Tied
Earring (wand and earring were just hanging out in the bank)
I gained quite a bit of mana and over 100hp :)
