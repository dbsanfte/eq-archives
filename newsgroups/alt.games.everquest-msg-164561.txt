Ah well, never met a female eq and i tend to think of all the females as men
in drag, although there clearly are female players, perhaps just not in
australia. I've met lots of guys who play eq but the number of female aussie
eq players I've encountered = 0. Number of counterstrike female players = 1.
Number of men gamers I've met at work, in Borders, in Games Workshop or Tin
Soldier or Galaxy Bookshop = 100's.

(Mind you I met a female professional manga reviewer, which I think has got
to be the ultimate niche role. Has anyone ever heard of a stranger job? )

Also, female and male iksar are pretty indistinguishable from a mammalian
point of view, although the new female model seems to have breast mounds,
like the old store dummies, which is rather upsetting... mammaries = mammal!

One of the reasons I really liked playing an iksar when I started years ago
was that you were sexless effectively, which saves dealing with people
excited by the contours of your toons pixels hassling you. I scrapped my
female DE necro and started a male one because i was sick of the proposals.

Which is all very sad, but basically I think sexual frustration created the
internet (and mp3s now sustain it, but i was there in the early days), and
without that great force of male misery, there'd probably be no everquest!
