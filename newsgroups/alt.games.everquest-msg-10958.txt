A simple hub works for a static dsl connection. Problem is that most
companies are using ppoe, which makes it more difficult. Routers are

Read up on/Talk to the manufacturer of any 3rd party equipment before buying
it. They need to be able to support you in some simple connectivity issue
situations.
