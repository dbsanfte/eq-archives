I think I saw some in Katta.  BTW, I only found SOME 16-44 research-only
spells there.  I didn't find ANY level 29 mage pet spells (mine is 32) so
I'm looking forward to 34 when I do have them all. :)

In Katta, I don't have the loc, but if you're coming from the east and you
zone in, the first huge building on your right is where the SH Library quest
guy can be found.  The research spells are in the FAR right
building...inside the building is square with 4 alcoves in the corners and a
big empty space in the middle where if you look up you'll see more floors.

To get to the upper floors you click on the tapestry that is on the wall
between a couple guards.  I believe if you click twice that'll get you to
the floor with the research onlys.
