Since you are a warrior your main job is just what you said. Keeping the mobs
on you. If you want to do more damage get better 1HS weapons. You pull out
the 2HS when you are not the main tank and when there is a mob with a damage
shield your group can't dispel.

If you need to practice it get together with a druid friend, find a big animal
the druid snares and fears it, and you beat on it from behind. Use the fastest
2h Slasher you can find, in fact it would be better if it had low damage as well
since you are just practicing. If you can, bring a shaman or enchanter to speed
you up.

Get an Axe of the Iron back 16/37, its pretty common and pretty fast for a 2HS.
