Right at the entrance you say, darn that will make it difficult to
even get in there, i'm really not into dying since i will loose the
hard to get xp, so i think i stay in lavastorm, at the first open area
wich leaves the zone close for fleeing :)

Hope that maybe someone will find one of them staffs and give it to me
no big chance i guess but i was given my fine steel great staff.

But right now the servers are down and i'm starting to experiencing
withdrawal syndroms *lol* this game is way to addictive :)

Thanks for the info
