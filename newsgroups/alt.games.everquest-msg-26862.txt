}Words have meanings.  Learn what they are.

from m-w.com:

Anagram: a word or phrase made by transposing the letters of another word
or phrase
Spoonerism: a transposition of usually initial sounds of two or more words
Spelling: to write or print the letters of in a particular way
Transposing: to change the relative place or normal order of : alter the 
sequence of <transpose letters to change the spelling>

Hence, if you transpose letters of something, by rendering an anagram or 
spoonerism, you are, in fact, misspelling the original something.  Hence, 
it is covered by the naming policy.  QED.

At least, that's proof good enough for me.  If you still feel unconvinced, 
from here on out, that's your own problem. :)
