Is it really or is it just a really good idea? I guess to get an idea of 
universal for that would mean running millions of sites through that w3 
thingee to see how many are html strict compliant or not and nobody's 
going to do that.

I was understanding the 'universal' you meant as in the user end, and 
with its flaws IE is as close to a universally /available/ browser as 
exists. It's not the best. It's not the fastest. It's not the cleanest. 
It's not the safest. It is everywhere though. You can't swing a cat 
without it slapping headfirst into a computer with SOME version of IE 
installed on it.

You were using universal in a different way. I'm not convinced it's a 
correct way as I suspect the average web page isn't designed with strict 
compliance in mind as much as say, readability, ease of use, and search 
engine placement lol not necessarily in that order hehehe. But I think I 
at least understand what you're saying. I completely disagree that it 
was as bad as it's being made out to be, but I'm pretty easy going about 
that sort of thing and tend to assume that I'm more in control of my 
computer than the script kiddies out there, regardless of what browser 
I'm running. Years of experience have convinced me of this. It could be 
that I'm naive though. :)
