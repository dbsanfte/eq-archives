I thought the Golden Ticket got you a trip to Wonka's Chocolate Factory?

Seriously, I wish they would put in a casino that actually had games of chance
(ie blackjack, roulette, etc.)  Gambling existed in the olden days, so maybe an
actual game from that era would work too.  I am sure the "Give the waitress
some cash and hope she gives you a golden ticket" does not fit it with the
genre of the game.
