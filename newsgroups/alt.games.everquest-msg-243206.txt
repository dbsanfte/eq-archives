I have this problem. One interesting thing I found was that the wood elf I
was with was able to go with it every time ( out of 4 tries ) but my Vah
Shir fell off every time. tried shrinking and it didn't make a difference.
I'm picking it may have something to do with the bounding box of the PC
models. I don't think they change the sizes of those even when you shrink.
