  Well, yes.  In this case, you are right.  On Usenet, I believe that I can
make the call as to whom I want to speak to or not.  The contents of your
killfile should have nothing to do with the contents of mine.  I think I
feel this way because Usenet (at least the corners of it that I hang out
in) tends to be an overly emotional, snap judgment kind of place, at least
from time to time.  I've seen people get into bitter, arguments laced with
the most venomous of personal attacks, over what seems to me to be the most
trivial of issues.  And on Usenet, the stakes are pretty low, disregarding
the occasional wackjob that tries to spill it into real life.  We are
reading words on a screen.  The words might annoy us, anger us, amuse us,
whatever.  But I don't know that they really have the power to damage us.  

    Everyone else in the newsgroup might have a certain fool killfiled. 
That is their right.  But the fact that everyone has made that choice
doesn't mean that they have the right to make the choice for me.  I may
very well decide to do so on my own, but that is entirely up to me.  I will
admit that I prefer to not use my killfile very much at all.  I can handle
that other people might say things I don't like, without just removing them
from my sight.  Not in all cases though.  I did KF "End Times Prophet", in
all his incarnations.  I dunno the csipgr group got hit with him or not,
but let me just say that he was very annoying, and very prolific.  But just
because he pushed me to point that I KF'd him, I would never ask someone
else not to reply to him (Though if that person just got into long drawn
out flame wars with him, I might KF them as well).

   Now, admittedly the story about the blacklisting attempt on the commie64
bbs I told was pretty much apples and oranges to the current situation.  As
a sysop, if I had gone along with the banning of the husband I would have
been making the choice for my user base, basically for reasons the husband
had no control over.  I was just using it to illustrate that I have in the
past taken a stand on the issues of Blacklisting, not just thought of it on
the fly now to avoid looking petty for not going along with Julie's polite
request (or advice, or whatever term she sanctions in this instance) that I
follow along now.

   Just to further muck up the situation, I have to say that I don't balk
at blacklists in every situation.  Since I don't deal that well with the
abstract, let me set an example in Everquest (I hope that by doing so I
don't sound like I am lapsing into gibberish to our csipgr brethren).  Let
us say that I am in a guild, and I am an officer in that guild.  I have the
power, along with the other officers, to blackball any particular applicant
to our guild.  One blackball vote is enough to keep anyone out, by the
rules of our guild.  I read the server forum often, and I notice that a
recent applicant is showing up in the rants section of the forum over and
over again.  It seems that there are several complaints lodged about him
for being a scammer, ninja looter, trainer, and all around GP prick. 
Several of the complainers are long time and respected members of the
server's community.  I decide that I believe the complaints, though I have
never had a single bad experience with the applicant personally.  In this
situation, I wouldn't hesitate to cast the blackballing vote.  Someone like
that could hurt the reputation of our guild, and if we helped him get
better equipped he might be more efficient in causing grief among other
players.  

   So does this make me a flip flopper on the issue?  I don't think so. 
Different situations call for different applications.  In general, I don't
love blacklists, but I can see times when they can be good to put into use.
