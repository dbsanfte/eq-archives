Sol Ro is required for access to PoFire.

Bertox / Agnarr are required for Access to Sol Ro's chambers, and access to
Earth/Water/Air.

There are two facets to being EP flagged.

Earth / Air / Water - everything up to but not including Sol Ro.

Fire - everything up to, and then including, Sol Ro.

(Everything is a misnomer in this case, but it covers the bases)

It's a big chart, and can look ugly, but I think it's valid,

This covers it too, but not as elegant,
