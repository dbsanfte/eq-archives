You described a method of stealing. Encouraging someone to commit a
criminal act is wrong. Plain and simple. 

What someone writes in their own diary is their business. It does not
encourage others to commit unlawful acts.

Are you one of those fools that think laws do not apply to them, or
that getting away with something makes it OK?
