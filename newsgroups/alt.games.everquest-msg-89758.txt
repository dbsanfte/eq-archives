Hi all,

Just bought EQ again and am in the process of installing the Trilogy.
Problem is I got the game installed and start to DL the patches when I get
the following msg: Connecting to update server
                          Receiving file "drivers.tx_"
                          connection lost
                          EQ file update failed
                          [patch.eq.com7000tcp]
                          Error corrupt or missing file on
                          update server.

I have just built this system and all drivers are up to date.  In an act of
desperation I contact EQ tech via phone and the rep simply suggests that I
enter the EQ dir. and delete the file "drivers.tx_" and this will fix the
problem.  I hang up (big mistake), and go to delete the file however, there
is no file named "drivers.tx_"  located under my EQ Dir. So now I find
myself trying to contact tech once again before closing hours. Has anyone
ran into this? Any fixes or suggestions?

Thanks
Jason
