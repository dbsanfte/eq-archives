They probably have better weapons. A fine steel longsword isn't all that
impressive as weapons go. It costs a lot, and sells for a relatively large
sum for a starter, but there are better weapons available for not much more.
In the bazaar, unfortunately, but if you don't have Luclin yourself you can
ask a friend to go shopping for you.

It's also possible that their weapons have higher damage but also higher
delay. That is, they may do 20 damage but take 50% longer to hit, which
would more or less balance out. This will be particularly true if they're
using two-handed slash weapons, which tend to be high-damage.

Which server are you on by the way? One thing you'll find here is people
will often offer to lend a newbie a hand - I have some gear banked that
may be useful if you're on Cazic Thule.
