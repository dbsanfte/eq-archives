You may want to re-examine that idea.  Invis spells like to break the
instant any casting is done, and that includes singing.  You may be able to
use invis and selos alternately, one for areas that need invis (though, not
to undead), and the other for areas you can speed through, but you won't be
able to use them together until you get Selo's song of travel.
