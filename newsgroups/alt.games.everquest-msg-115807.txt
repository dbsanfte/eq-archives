    I have to wonder even about that. I suspect that they simply assume
anyone whose items were stripped to someone else was sharing
accounts/E-Bay'ing, and refuse to help them.

    I agree. If you throw it in their faces so they can't pretend not to
notice, they ban. But I don't think they go looking for it. You can't
explain some of the very distinct accounts that have been sold on my server
multiple times each otherwise - how could they NOT have noticed?
