Likewise I don't care about twinking in any way shape or form, up to you how
you play the game. But beggars really are morons.

'Can you spare some plat for a new (add class)', bollox to em, you just know
they are doing a /who for the whole zone and just sending tells to high
lvls. I hate unwarranted tells, I just tell them to go earn it like everyone
else and you always get the 'You're Gay' response, bastards the lot of them.
In the course of gameplay if someone comes to me and does the appropriate
role play emotes etc I never begrudge someone a clarity but you do get the
odd idiot want you to walk across a zone to give him the clarity Sheesh! I
never charge for spell buffs and i never pay for spell buffs. I play a druid
as one of my chars and if someone asks nicely for a CR SoW then I give them
the buff, no cost to me so no cost to them. I pay for teleports as it is for
my convenience of cutting out hours of travel time (boats suck) but only pay
a token amount. Same goes with cleric exp rez, uses a lot of mana and time
for the cleric so i dont mind donating to save a few hours worth of kills
exp.

One thing that really annoys me is people wanting me to 'Could you just
enchant a few bars of platinum please'. This I do charge for, 5 bars of
platinum takes all of my mana so have to med to full 4/5 times to complete
the task, takes a long time, and the bars are for jewel crafting to make
them profit.And 9 times out of 10 they get insulting over this.

Make a social to shout across the zone '(add beggar name) fails in begging,
(your name) increases skill Ignore Beggars 76'
