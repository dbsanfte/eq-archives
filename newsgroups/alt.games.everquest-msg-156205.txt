I mean the difference in skill caps alone should make anyone but an idiot
see that the difference in tanking ability, even after the patch it is :

Ranger:
Dodge 170
Defense 240
Parry 220
Riposte 150

Paladin
Dodge 170
Defense 252
Parry 205
Riposte 200

Monk
Dodge 230
Defense 252
Block 230
Riposte 225

And every monk I checked the same level as me before the patch had like 100
more AC than me, enough to match the knights...

Another quote:

"Easy to test, let a warrior and a monk of same level and similar equippment
duel each other, you can belive me that alone block vs parry can make you
cry.
The same mob i kill with a warrior/cleric duo, needing 2 CHs can be easy
done with a monk/shaman combo in half the time with less mana usage.
the big difference between warrior and monks (or any other melee class) come
to play agains massive damage hitters where you either can use defense or
have by far enough hp to survive betweens the heal in a fast CH-chain.

Oh, i use my level 60 warrior with 1238 unbuffed ac (you see, not ueber :P )
and a 56 cleric as my duo combo.

Banzan, warlord "
