Thanks for the info. :-)

The Icegrinder doesn't proc until 30? Hmmmm......I guess the posts I read at
Allhakazam were wrong, then. I probably should have read farther. By then
it'll be useless, because I already have a Wakazishi of the Frozen Skies for
him to use as a secondary weapon once he hits lvl 20 (Since it does a 80dd
proc starting at that lvl), and am planning on having him use a 1hb weapon
for dual wielding until then (Starting once he gets Dual Wield, that is).

I'll have to go back and see if Warriors can use a Groaning Mace (I see a
LOT of Clerics using one, but have never really paid attention to what
classes can use it), because I saw one for sale in the Bazaar for 50pp
earlier.
