I'd have shrugged and got on with life, personally...

Generally, 'recruiting' people who are already guilded is a bad idea, as 
you say below.

>The problem with this is that it's difficult to prove.

And here's the crux of the problem.  Consider me, personally.  I have a 
bestest friend ever in EQ.  due to one thing or another, it has on 
occasion happened that we were not currently in the same guild.  On one 
occasion, because she hadn't played in a long time, and I'd moved on, and 
on another occasion, because she went off to join a guild for a while with 
a real life really good friend.  Now, I want her in the same guild as me, 
because, well, I just do!  If she logs on after a prolonged absence, or 
gets bored of the other guild because, well, I'm not in it, and leaves 
that guild to apply to my current guild, are we going to argue that I 
'recruited her away' just by existing, or what?

It's silliness.  People have a huge number of reasons for wanting to 
switch from one guild to another.  Must we try to assign blame to someone 
for providing them a reason?

Many many people outgrow their guild, and want to move up to a higher 
guild that tackles more challenging content.  And this always upsets the 
people who haven't outgrown that guild and get left behind.  But really, 
is it their fault?  They want to play the game to have fun, and they 
aren't having fun helping the rest of the guild catch up while going 
through the same content yet again.  And it builds fricion being guilded 
with people who aren't having fun.  So really, let them go have fun with 
the raid guild... you'll be in their shoes soon enough.  If you accomplish 
the miracle, and manage to find a guild-sized group of people that all 
magically play the same amount, and had roughly the same experiences 
starting out, and are at the same level when you start, hey, you might 
manage to all hang together on the same team forever and ever.  But that 
ain't bloody likely.

And one last thought:  If you love your members, set them free.  If they 
really love you, they'll come back time-equipped and PL you. :)

Yea, in every guild I've been in that discussion comes up at the formation 
of the guild, and continues onward forever with bitterness and resentment 
on both sides all the way until the guild's firey and rcrimination-laden 
demise.  It's even less fun than a thread about top-posting. Sigh.
