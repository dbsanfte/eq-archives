That's pretty quixotic, Ben.  You vs. alt.games.everquest.

If it really didn't matter to you what people thought, you wouldn't be here
saying it, trying to make us believe that.

I won't hang names on you such as "buffoon," but you do come across as being
pretty immature and overly sensitive at times to the point where you are the
defense a lot of the time and attacking back at people who you think are
at-odds with you.

Try dropping the abusiveness down a notch or two and I think you'll find far
fewer people confronting you.

But of course, you don't care one whit about all that, right?  =)
