That's about as overzealous as you can get!

Last night I was watching a group that was camping Orc 1 in EC; I was
invisible, thanks to Gather Shadows (I participate in Orc Camp raids sometimes,
but I also like to just stand back and watch). There was a player killstealing
left and right AND HE ADMITTED HE WAS DOING IT! Why? Because he had two
accounts; he had grouped with another of his characters in order to do some
powerleveling at other players' expense. As soon as they reported him, he left
immediately, but I wouldn't be surprised if he does it again to another group. 

I eventually dropped the invisibility and started attacking giant spiders and
black bears nearby (within view of the camp, but not in the camp itself); no
one was going after those unless they came within the camp area, so it wasn't
killstealing. Gained almost a whole bubble of experience just from that. (I
usually hang out at the EC tunnel, slaying Pumas, Zombies and Skeletons and
running from Lesser Mummies and Ghouls)

As for tailoring; tell me about it! I have a skill of 21 in tailoring, and
haven't been able to sell a blasted thing yet. I've been getting ruined pelts
left and right, and am more tempted to sell them to a vendor than waste time
and patterns making things that I would probably end up selling to the same
vendor instead of players anyway. (I have sold a few HQ cat pelts and several
MQ cat and wolf pelts, though)

How rare are HQ bear pelts, anyway? I've killed about 20 Pumas and got 4-5 HQ
cat pelts, but I've never once got a HQ bear pelt off the 15 or 16 Black Bears
I've killed.
