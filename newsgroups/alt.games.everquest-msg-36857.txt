It's a three-way tie:

1.  Mistmoore.  I was level 45 (Paladin), which is rather
high for Mistmoore, and I was feeling pretty
invulnerable, especially since I was hanging around
the zone-in ramp waiting for my friends to arrive.
Every once in a while, someone would call "train
to zone!" (nothing unusual about that in Mistmoore),
and I'd stick around to help clean up the train,
and heal the less fortunate.  So about the tenth
time someone yelled "train to zone!", I stayed
sitting/medding until I could see the head of the
train round the tower near the bottom of the ramp.
...and I see that it looks like THE ENTIRE CASTLE
coming at me.  I hit my "stand" button, start
rotating to my left to face the zone-out line so
I can make a run for it, and I die before I've
even turned 90 degrees.

2.  Cazic-Thule.  A bunch of us were hanging around
the courtyard, when a door flew open and what
came out  looked like someone spraying lizards
from a firehose.  We zoned, fast.

3.  Runnyeye (before the change).  Our guild is
small and consists of people of widely varying levels,
so for a guild outing we decided to go visit Runnyeye,
which most people had never seen, and since I could
solo any spot there, it seemed like I'd be able to
keep every safe, especially since we had a high-level
druid also.  Wrong assumption.  We were doing ok
until we hit the King room, and one of our level
20-somethings stepped too close to the door and the
whole King room came running out at us.  Oh well.
We waded on in and were doing ok, when out of nowhere
more goblins started running in and helping.  And
then more.  And then more.  I did my best to taunt
goblins off our lower-level members, and beat on them
until they ran (which only took one or two swings),
and then had to turn my attention to the other
goblins that were about to kill my guildmates,
while throwing heals everywhere in sight.
And more goblins kept coming...  Eventually we
had so many goblins that I couldn't even see my
guildmates anymore, it was if someone had unloaded
a dumptruck full of goblins on us.  Most of the
guild died horrible deaths, and the druid and I
booked out to the zone.  It was only later that
someone asked the Bard, "say, doesn't that sword
of yours have an AoE proc?"
