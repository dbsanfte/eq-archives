Hello.

I normally play my Ranger, Druid or Barb Shaman but recenly decided to start
an Iksar.  Since I know how to play a shaman I went with that.  Iksars are
very cool to play.  I love regen.  If Shamans or Iksars got track then an
Iksar Shaman would be the perfect char.  Unless an Iksar could be a Druid.
Oooh.  Anyway, just FYI, my highest char is my ranger.  He's a level 15.
But since my Druid hit 14, he's pretty much become my main.

So anyway, I'l level 3 out in the field of bone killing scorpians for the
pincer quest (excellent xp) when an idiot asks me to group.  No thanks, I'm
not really in the mood.  Hit disband.  Asks me again.  I DO NOT want to
group.  Thanks for asking.  Hit disband.  SPam asks me to group.  Over and
over.  Ok, he's an idiot, I move away.

He comes running through me, not by me, through me, with about 5 bettles and
several scale pups.  He runs past me about 20 feet and turns around to watch
his handy work.  One of the pups aggros on me, I kill it with a couple of
whacks.  In the meantime, he realizes that bettles don't aggro unless you
hit them.  He tries to run and dies. Idiot.

I'm waltzing along the path. Dummdeedum.  See someone fighitng a beetle.  2
or 3 more beetles run over and attack him.  He freaks and yells for help.
I'm the only one around.  I run over to at least try to help and find it's
the idiot.  For the first time in my EQ life, I didn't try to help someone
in distress.  He died.  I don't feel good about it (well kinda) but I do
believe he got a big dose of insta-karma.

The guy was blue to me at level 3, so I know he didn't lose any xp.  I
didn't do a who to see what he was but I hope a caster.  Without meditate
relearning spells sucks.

I went down to the catacombs beneath cabilis for the first skull quest.  A
level 8 warrior was down there exploring and helped me get 2 of the 3 skulls
I needed.

Sometimes it seems as if the idiots out number the good players but I dont
think so.  And every now and then, good things happen. hehe

Lewis
