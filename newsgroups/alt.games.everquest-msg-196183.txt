While an uberguild might have done that as a stunt, they didn't do it
because it was easy, like National Geographic doesn't send camera crews in
to film you climbing up the hill outside town, they send them along with
expeditions up Everest or K2 or so forth.

Bards arent the top aggro class, in fact they may well be down near the
bottom.  I have a song that decreases aggro, similar to ranger Jolt; I've
never once even thought "hmm I should mem that".  Hate kiting with a bard is
difficult, you want the mob to follow you around while your buddy beats on
it, which is easy for a druid or cleric or wizard to do and very hard for a
bard, although the bard would be in the best position as hate bait, since he
can do his full DOT output while on the move and never having to stop.

Slow, snare, DOT, DD, resist debuff, mez, healing; all things that seem to
be high aggro for other classes do almost nothing for a bard.  Best way to
get aggro as a bard is to charm a mob and then drop the charm, but that
would certainly be impractical for any raid target.

Oh, and while bards do get dual weild, they don't get double attack (perhaps
as an AA?) so that even lets them out of the running on the "pure melee, no
taunt button" end of aggro production.

All in all I'd say this is for the best, as bards are very active, casting
new spells every few seconds, doing AE heal and buffs on 30 people at a
time, and at the same time are basically about as resistant to damage as
paper mache; once your bard gets aggro he ends up looking a lot like a used
pinata!
