Bizbee started a thread a couple weeks ago about how he logged off LONG
before the 3 hour rez timer ran out, but that the timer continued to run
after he left.  He was told by a GM that it "works as intended."   Others as
credible here echoed that they were told the same thing.

But yeah, what you've said is how I believe it's supposed to work as well.
