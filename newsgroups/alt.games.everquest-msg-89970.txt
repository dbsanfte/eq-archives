You need to enter the hole in the correct manner, and get a necro to summon
your corpse. To enter in the correct way, you turn left where you fell voer
the cliff, head through the paineel newbie area and out the other side. Down
stairs, past the entrance to warrens and down to a water pool. In the corner
of this pool are some rocks which can be opened with a key, or just nudged
past... real easy in wolfform. You go through an underwater passage and then
zone into "the hole". Swim up, and your on land and this is where to summon
corpse.

I dont think the cliff is "cleverly disguised". More like you wernt watching
where you were going. What I dislike about it is that someday im gonna go LD
just as i approach, and then of course, over the side while LD.
