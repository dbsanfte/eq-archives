Well truly PL'd it could have been done in 1/4 of the time.  I get bored
easily though, so spent most of my time grouped with friends.   Im also uber
lazy, I wish those big ZEM zones were a zone from nexus :(

Anyway from 1 to 62 went something like this-
Start assling rogue, load in for the first time..  Attack my trainer, load
into Misty.  Picked him up, ported to the nexus, and geared him up in the
bazaar.

Walk into Paladual at level 1.  Kill from the zonein to the other zones and
back, solo (Im not familiar with the zone).   In less than 1 hour log out at
level 26 (had a 54 magician DS on me at all times, for super fast kills.)

Move to Neth with ranger and rogue friend.  Spend a few hours here, log at
level 30.

Echo at 30 for an hour or so, the place has too few mobs that even with it's
ZEM, I was constantly waiting on repops and the exp slowed.

Level 30, off to GuK to do ass/sup and get a dark elf mask.  A night of
crappy exp, but we left with 2 illusion masks.

At 30 went to Dawnshroud, a combination of soloing, grouping with the
ranger, rogue (and sometimes necro), killing reds from the start
(rockhoppers, those black golems, wolves and the like)

At 45 leave DSP, go to ME.  Lag out whilst soloing (well, the first pull...)
and have my entire bot army wipe out to 2 "green to my monk" mobs...

45, time for JP.  Might have been a lil lower level, but i was there for
level 45.. I spent 3-4 days here, initially to get my illusion half-elf
mask, but I liked the camp and stayed longer.

At 45 off to Akheva ruins. A mix of soloing and grouping (and timeouts to
kill Va'Dyn, and the bigass wurm)

At this point I had big plans to a) faction in droga whilst it was still
blue, great exp, and a chance to raise the slow as hell chardok faction (to
do the 3 chardok quests),  and b) get all my Vexthal shards while it still
gives exp.

Leave Akheva at 53, plans shattered, when the exp finally becomes "very"
crappy, rather than just "crappy".

So to Velks at 53, its a zone I did 80+ AA's with on my monk, pre-pop, so a
zone im very familiar with.  Here it was a combination of soloing spiders,
or when grouped (ranger+monk), doing the "tents" camp.

The exp was "ok"...  each mob gave little to no exp, but they died so fast
and did such little damage, my monk+rogue were able to kill each mob in 30
seconds or so.  Fast enough pulls meant the exp was fast and furious, but a
night of this (whilst 4-boxing), for a few days in a row, sure fucked my
wrists up

So velks lasted till 57, then I finally got bored, and bought Planes of
Power.

Had a "little" nasty run-in with the hobgoblins in PoN and the navigationaly
challenged members of my party, which ultimatly ended in an abandoned group,
and logging offs in frustration. Oh yeah, and decided the zone could go to
hell.

Next day, PoD castle (last Friday).  This time grouped with 60 warrior/60
cleric friends, the necro twink, and ranger twink.   Spent several hours
here, even had a charmed bug, the exp was a joke.  Decided, "PoV time!"

So off we went to PoJ.  First up to be flagged was my rogue (57), the
warrior and cleric (both 60).  The rest of the group was DPS/crowd control.
1 for 1 in the execution trial, so far so good.

Next upto be flagged was the ranger (level 52).

There is a 30 minute wait for successful trials, so in the meantime we
decided to try another trial.  Oh dear....

After GYing and re-rezzing/buffing, we go back to the execution trial.   By
this point we've lost the enchanter and level 65 ranger(DPS guy), so replace
them with guildie shaman and rogue.

The ranger comes back from his long LD, and, already being weary of our low
DPS (subbing a 57 rogue for a 52 ranger), the (now flagged) 60 warrior
agrees to sit out, so the 65 ranger can re-join, and I tank the show.

Executioner down, 2 for 2.

Spend some time killing to Death row, get the pre-flag, fight back through
DR (wtf is up with the repop down there?!), then kill re-pops to go back to
the Tribunal, and get flag 2.  Spend more time fighting back through DR, and
get the final flag (PoV/PoS entry).

Kill DR yet again on the way out, and log for the day.  This was last Friday
btw... so the night over (now past 4am by now) and no new levels, but new
flags and anticipation.

Saturday is spent in Plane of Valor, in the wasteland.  Group generally
comprimising of the 57 rogue, 52 ranger, 60 warrior/cleric, and my 65
monk/shaman).  Ding 58.  Sunday, ding 59.

Monday, its over to PoS to kill the named, and obtain Bastion of Thunder
keys.  Grats 59 rogue, now tagged for tier 1,2 and 3 zones :p

Back to PoV, ding 60 in the wasteland.

That same night, its off to PoD again, but this time to kill Grummus.  Grats
52 ranger on CoD flag (and my rogue)

Tuesday was PoV once again, a combination of pretty fast exp (charmed golem
pet, hitting for 500 or so a pop) but equally fast deaths (trains, bad
timing charm breaks, resists, group-screwups etc).  This time its for AA's,
and he dings twice by the end of the session

Wednesday, this time its PoV caves.  I only did this camp one time ever on
my monk, and all I really remembered of it was "great exp, damn those mobs
are tough though!".   "Solod" there for a while (exping the
monk/shaman/rogue), found out its actually a ridiculously easy camp....
then when the rest logged on, it became a group with the warrior, cleric,
ranger and enchanter (main of the necro from earlier).  Ding AA # 3, run
speed 3, and also ding 61.

Thursday, repeat of Wednesday.  This time just exp, and ding 62.  (and
countless dings on the monk, shaman, enchanter, warrior, cleric, ranger etc)

There were a few other minor details and trips, e.g trips to Kael for
faction (he was on an AoW raid at level 30 hehe), and then subsequent trips
to Skyshrine to MQ his armour (I used my monk/shaman to farm HoT in between
playing the rogue, to get armour for rogue and friends)

Skill training sessions occured (sense trap, disarm trap, PP, sneak, hide),
and attempts to start my epic (spent a night in Kel. trying to PP the note
before I thought fuck it, and asked a 65 guildie rogue)

Sometimes it came up.. but very few and very far between.
Levels 1-15 in Paladual I had a tough time hitting mobs before the DS killed
them, so I banked my horn of hsagra (13 delay), wielded a 7/2x lame but fast
weapon, and got used to clicking the DS off, until I landed a hit on mobs.

When I did my BoT key in PoS, there was some swimming required, to get to
the forest.  My uber 59 rogue and his 13 swimming skill couldn't live long
enough under-water though, that was resolved via a CoH mage tho =p

Another problem is I never re-bound him.. he's still bound in the very place
he first popped at as a level 1 (after killing the trainer), somewhere in
Misty.

This is all good and well, but in PoS aftrer the BoT key farming, and in PoD
after the Grummus kill, the guild just casts AE TL to bind.  No thanks, I
don't want to go to misty !

His skills are -
1hs : maxed
Piercing: maxed
Defence, offence, riposte, parry etc : maxed
Backstab: maxed
Pick Pocket: 188
Sense Heading: Maxed
Sense Traps: 150
Disarm traps: 100
Lock Pick: 160 (from 0-160 in <5 minutes!  I burned all my training points
and 4ish k on this heh)
Disarm: 0 (useless)
H2H: 0 (useless)
ID: 0 (useless)
Apply/make poison: 0 (trade skills... /snore)

Safe fall is a little low, 90 or so, but i forgot to train this until in the
50's (riposte too, heh).  It will get maxed by itself im sure.

He has 2 robes, and the 2 notes for his epic, still lots of work to do here
though.

His only downfall is he's likely the only 60+ rogue in EQ thats not epicfied
!

With "regular" buffs I can get his ATK to 1600ish.  Hitpoints buff upto
5kish.  Max BS so far is just 960 or so =(

-m

p.s - this is all from memory.. if it differs with something I said in
channel, go by that... it was said at the time and accurate.. this is a
thinking back exercise).. or of course just think im a liar.  I don't care
=p
