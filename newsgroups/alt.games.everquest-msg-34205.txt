My sister plays a really EVIL game.  When she goes to a large gathering 
of any kind where she doesn't know anybody (IE a concert or a con or 
something), she'll pick someone out of the crowd, run up to them and say 
something like "Hiiii!  Oh wow, hiiiii!  I haven't seen you guys in 
*ages*!  Remember me, Julie?"  The people will invariably stutter 
something like "Oh... er, uh... Julie!  Yes, er, hi Julie!  Um.. how, 
uh.. how are you?"  Then she'll go on, asking them about their family, 
etc etc, and eventually say she has to go, tell them it was nice running 
into them again, and she hopes to see them again soon.

... those poor, POOR people ...
