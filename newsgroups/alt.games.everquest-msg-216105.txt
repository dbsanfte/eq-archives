It's definetely a crappy cleric, just as it is...

Many people say i know how to play a cleric, and 20% is much too low to
start CH. Usually, in past 60 groups you start CHing as soon as a tank
starts taunting cause an unslowed mob is quite capable of hurting the tank.
Then, once the mob is slowed i usually start casting CH around 50%, 40 if
it's a very good tank. Then you still have time to cast a fast heal if you
get interrupted and recast the CH. As soon as a group member dies three
times in one adventure it should be a sign that the cleric just doesn't do
his/her job, and yes, then it's a druid turn to take over... and you did a
good job on that, more people like you please ;)
