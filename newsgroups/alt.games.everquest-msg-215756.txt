     Cash is tight for spells at first.  Get his spells and malachite
of course.  Give your early pets a high damage weapon, like a rusty
2hand sword, and they will perform much better for you.  You will get
summoned magical weapons soon -- useful for killing wisps for spell
money and exp.  Gnoll hide lariats used to drop in Blackburrow, which
is a great pet weapon because of the stun, but when I brought my new
barb BL there recently I didn't find any.  They do still drop in Split
Paw I understand.

    Get his focus items via the Sol Ro Temple quest.  These items make
the summoned pets better. Most of the items drop in Najena and you can
get some of your epic items there. The bracer of clay quest (mana free
Eye of Zomm) is nice, but it is much less important than your pet
focus.  The robe queest in Sol Ro isn't worth doing in my opinion
because there are so many cheaper and better robes in the bazaar.  Get
the summoned jewelry spells from Joluum in the bazaar to make your
nukes do more damage for less mana as soon as you are close to
scribing them.  

     Invising kills the pet, so any sort of instant invis item can be
useful since gnomes can't hide.  There is a "pet get lost" command you
can use instead of invis; keep a hot key for it or for invis handy but
away from your "pet attack" and "pet back off" keys.
