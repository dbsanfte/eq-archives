It would be very difficult for me to be proven wrong in this thread, as I've
really made no statement regarding databases.  My sole addition in this

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
