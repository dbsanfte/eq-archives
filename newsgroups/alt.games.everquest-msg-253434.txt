Thats a thought, actually, get my exp bar filled out in 65, then go AA 
for a month or two while waiting for the expansion.  As you say (and as 
I said), its leveling that's the carrot I most enjoy anyway.

Oddly no, just thinking aloud, as I've done in this newsgroup for nigh 
on 5 years.

Be one screwed up troll, to post for 5 years just to set you up for this 
little screed.  I do admit I try to think of things to post to get 
people to reply... but its more in the vein of trying to start 
conversations, rather than the trollish desire to stir up angry 
responses for the pure joy of it.

Splendid One, 65 gnomage
Bergh Brelltender, 65 Cleric
Llyric, 57 bard
Paax, 52 shaman
Srimp Scampi, 34 druid
Matte, 30 enchanter
Praise, 50 cleric, account sold the first time I "quit"
Defeat, 30 warrior, deleted
and a host of lesser lights, some gone on that sold account, some still 
around on one server or another, quite a few deleted either to make room 
on the server I played on most, or in the fury that was... what was the 
name of that crazy server where we went back to first level whenever we 
died?

Heck of a long way to go for a joke
