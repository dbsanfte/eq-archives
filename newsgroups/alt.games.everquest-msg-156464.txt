What does it matter if people have more AC than you?  You can't compare
different tier people, im sorry, its just not a fair comparison.

I have more AC than you, and do you know why?  Because im in a guild that
pharms AoW/Ssra named, because I raid day in day out 7 days a week, because
I AA exp and quest to better myself even more.

Even if I could outtank you, what does it prove?  Warriors in my guild have
a hell of a lot more AC than me and you both.. they outtaunt and outtank me
time and time again.

Compare yourself to monks/rangers in your guild, not to monks/other classes
pharming stuff above the level your capable of killing
