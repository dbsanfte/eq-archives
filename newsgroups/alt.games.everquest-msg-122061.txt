So go on "open" raids, or make friends in other guilds and go with them
when they are short handed.  At your level you won't be able to go on
single group HOT camps, but if you can get your resists up over 200 you'll
still be an asset to any multigroup raid.  General rule is Non-KOS to COV,
Level over 53, Resists over 150 (fire, cold primarily)

HOT is so simple compared to KD you won't believe it.  It amounts to
killing Vox or Nafalgen once every five minutes or so, with none of the
fussing with giants, and no level limit.  Buff up to the gills, exercise good
aggro control, hide the casters except when casting, the healers always,
and endure the withering AOE while grinding the dragon down...oh, and
tank stun the CHealing ones of course.

One big difference, its much more important to not die.  With Vox, some
death is often just part of the price you pay.  But in HOT, the raid wants
to pull the next dragon as soon as possible.  Rez, heal, put buffs back up..
thats a time and mana sink, compared to just healing the injured.   So you
need those resists, you need (if you can get it) Levels, you need healers to
concentrate on keeping everyone alive rather than just the MA, and you
need tanks and nukers who know when its time to run and hide from the
AOE, not try to tough it out.
