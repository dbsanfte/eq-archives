Are you even reading replies?

Who has a reason to be close enough for any length of time to be a 
bother? 1) people selling 2) people meditating 3) people recovering from 
a bad pull 4) people waiting for a group 5) people binding or porting.  
The bank is where EVERYBODY of the goblin level congregates.  And you 
don't have to be there any 'length of time' for to be emote spammed.  As 
soon as you start spamming it, guess what, you're spamming it.  The 
screen immediately starts scrolling like mad, and you have to stop what 
you're doing, get up, and find somewhere out of range of the idiot 
pulling the trick, then scroll way the hell up in case you missed 
anything, and start again.  Why not retaliate yourself?  Oh I dunno.  
Because it's fucking childish?
