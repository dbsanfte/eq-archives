After attempting High Priest in Ssra in coalition with another guild
roughly at the same place in the game where we are then listening to
the third-place guild on our server wipe on him the next day, we went
back alone.

I asked in serverwide.cleric if there was any way for clerics to avoid
the stun. As usual, there were no answers. I'm convinced that is the
most useless fucking channel out there. I have yet to get a decent
healing strat from them.

So, I asked serverwide.age and Monuel immediately piped up with how to
line up with the pillar until you got a line-of-sight message on an
attempted nuke.

After that, it was relative cake, a smooth kill. We even kept the main
tank standing the whole time.

Kudos, Richard. You made a huge difference.
