It was obviously an analogy, with the "quotation" being from the
hypothosised cop in question ;)

I think both sides here have tenable positions - one regarding the
approach required for a system of justice, the other regarding the
pragmatic approach undertaken by VI for an efficient and economically
viable administration of a game.

But theres no need to deliberately misconstrue stuff based around
grammatical pedantry ;) Just 'cause someone isnt speaking the
Queens english if their point is easily comprehensible it behooves
one to address the point alone ;)

Sui, still wurbling and doubtless heading for a right good flaming
at this rate, probably guilty of the same actions at some ridiculously
deja'd point in the past ;)
