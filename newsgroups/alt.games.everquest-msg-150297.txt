Higher charisma will continue to increase sale prices and reduce
buying costs if the vendor has a high greed factor. But 105 is the
norm for 'most' non-greedy vendors.

It always pays to make sure to check several vendors in an area
to make sure you don't hit that one greedy one.

Some greedy vendors I know of:

Donlo Goobler, merchant across from the banker in Rivervale.
Any gnome clockwork vendor in The Overthere.
Erudite Merchant in the North West corner of the zone.
Female Merchant in Grimling forest kitty fort.

Never buy or sell to/from these guys if you can avoid it.
