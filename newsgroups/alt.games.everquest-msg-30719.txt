I don't know what a hoary robe is, but in EQ all classes have an epic quest.
This quest usually involves going back and forth over the whole planet, raid
a few planes, slay a dragon or two and generally takes several real-time
months to complete, if ever.

The prices are different for each class, but each is simply awesome in it's
own respect. Some examples: Clerics get a staff which has a right-click
effect of resurrect, mages get a new spell which summons a staff, which can
summon an enormous pet, Paladins get a fearsome flaming 2h-sword with which
they can bash as well, etc, etc.

Don't expect to get your epic soon, but it's one of the main goals of the
game (next to slaying the Sleeper :)
