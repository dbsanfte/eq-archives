/em applaud Verant!  Love all the changes!


played some monsters the other day on test and enjoyed it somewhat.

While on test I noticed that some of my cons were "light blue / cyan" and
did'nt think much of it. Nice change.  As a rogue, finding the lowest exp
giving mob could be a good thing for the insane "feel like solo'ing"
moments.

Will have fun trying this stuff tonight...
