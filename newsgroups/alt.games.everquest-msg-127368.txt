A couple of nites ago I was playing with some friends in Luclin.  We
ran into a very weird bug I haven't seen before.  One of our party
would periodically become invisible, even though we all had "see
invis".  Seemed like if she just stood still a while, she disappeared.
 The other guy in our group also couldn't see her, so it wasn't just
my comp.  And it persisted even after we zoned.

This was the first time any one of us had seen this bug.  Anyone else
hear of it?
