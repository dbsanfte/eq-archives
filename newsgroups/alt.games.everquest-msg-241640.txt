Getting kinda bored with EQ, and I'd like a guild for my 65 cleric on
Tarew Marr, preferebly one that is capable of raids, but doesn't have
to be one that necessarily raids all the time. It's been over a year
since I've been in an active guild, and I'm un-epiced. Anyone on Tarew
Marr in a decent guild have a need for clerics? :)
