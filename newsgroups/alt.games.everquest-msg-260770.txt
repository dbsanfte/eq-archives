JC is not as cheap as it used to be, sell back prices were nerfed some 
time back, and failures can cost a fair amount.  I am well aware of the 
cost, as I GMed JC a couple months back.

Tailoring is actually quite cheap to GM, if you farm the components.  
Pottery was actually profitable, if you have patience, as you can GM it 
on items that sell well to players.  Fletching is dirt cheap, if you farm 
the ingredients.

Personally, I don't have the patience to farm the ingredients, so I buy 
them up in the bazaar, and spend the time I would be farming getting 
drops I can sell to pay for my tradeskilling.
