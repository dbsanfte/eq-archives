Fair enough.  I *was* joking and I apologise for my misplaced 'humour'.

Go further down the limb, I have yet to group with anyone other than a 
couple of friends, let alone form a group.  Reasons (1) Confidence, or 
lack of it, in my abilities and knowledge of what I should be doing for 
the best of the group (2) I rather enjoy soloing, hence I am playing the 
somewhat derided druid (half-elf).

I do not want to get into a pick-up group and then be the cause of 
someone's death etc due to my lack of ability - that would really piss 
people off so why should I take that chance.  As someone who has only 
been playing for a few weeks at the moment (although I played for a few 
months last year the dropped the game for a while) it seems that most 
everyone else has been playing forever, has a deep knowledge of the game 
and will not bother with a real newbie.

Perhaps, in months to come I will begin grouping, or perhaps start 
another character more suited to grouping, who knows.
