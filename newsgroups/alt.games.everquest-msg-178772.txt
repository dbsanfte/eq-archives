OK, this might be a bit of a tired subject but I had a disagreement with
someone about this last night....

From what I've read it appears bard haste does not stack with chanter/shaman
hastes (with the exception of a couple stackable haste songs) except for
effects, but does with haste items.  I've also read that bard hastes are a
"set" value and neither amp nor instruments will increase it.

From what I can tell the first part is correct (which is the part I had the
disagreement with a chanter about).  It seems that when I kick in haste it
gets no faster even though I get the icon.
Now the second part...unless I've smoked enough weed to see this improperly,
if I fire up, say, VoV and *then* fire up amp, the haste immediately
increases dramatically.
However, the instrument part I cannot figure out.  I can't tell if it has an
effect or not, but I would guess not at this point.

Can anyone clue me in with their input please?

Tia,
SEAN...
