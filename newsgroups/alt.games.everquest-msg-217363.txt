If you're really enjoying the wizard class, stick with it.  As a previous
poster stated, get some PoP groups to get those parchments.  Put your
experience into AA while you're gathering the platinum for future spells.
There are lots of zones to hunt where the platinum will start to add up.
Also, find groups in LDoN.  It may take awhile, but you will eventually be
able to get some very nice gear upgrades with the points you gain.
