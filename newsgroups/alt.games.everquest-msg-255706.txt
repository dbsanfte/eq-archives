Probably. The last time we did him was with 21 people on an off raid night
and that was over a year ago. Groups are going to look a bit weird though.
You need good numbers of shamans and enchanters to slow/ mezz the adds for
the 30 minutes the fight will take.

If you can get to earth/fire/air/water they all give better reward for the
effort in raiding.
