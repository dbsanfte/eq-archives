I'm wondering how any adult can possibly have led such a sheltered
life as to believe what you just posted there.  No doubt you also
believe that acquiring a computer science degree teaches you all
that there is to know about being a software developer (hint: that's
not even vaguely close to being true), to choose an example that is
similarly sedentary to playing a computer game.

ROFL, ok, anything you say.

I won't say that your ignorance pains me, because it doesn't.  But it
ought to pain you.  If you cannot play well enough to judge the feel
of an instrument you simply do not know everything there is to know
about that instrument.  To claim complete understanding of something
without experience of it is complete bullshit.  It isn't real if it
isn't real DT.  And your claim to the contrary is nothing more than
self-congratulatory elitism.  You gotta get in and get your hands
dirty if you want to really understand something.  And that's just
as true of purely abstract endeavors like mathematics.  Reading about
mathematics does not teach you everything there is to know about it.
You're not a mathematician unless you do mathematics, no matter how
much you may have read about it.  Same thing works for ditch digging,
it just doesn't take so long to gain a fairly complete understanding
of ditch digging.
