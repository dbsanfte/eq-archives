They do have a certain potential role-playing use.  I remember one time
when I was running about in GFay, and someone was shouting all over the
zone in Dark Elven.  We eventually managed to get someone to translate.
It turned out she was charming the PoD and siccing them on the guards,
which was impressive to watch, and her /shouts were very much
in-character taunting of the wood elven race.  I felt that her use of the
language features very much added to the RPGness of it all.
