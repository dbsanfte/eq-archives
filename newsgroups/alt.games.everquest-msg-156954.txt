I going to pretend you're just kidding around, so I'll be a little more kind
than the original draft I had written in my mind...

Speaking as a Shadow Knight, I believe I have no real bias on this issue, so
I can see things as they are. Hopefully one of the Clerics here can correct
my points, should they be incorrect.

You've forgotten that Verant practically gave away the Cleric's -one- class
defining ability. Big heals/CH was the -only- unique thing they brought to a
group, and Verant practically hands that skill around to the other
priests -then- Verant nerfs the original Complete Healing spell. A hearty
"fuck you" to Verant goes on that nerf.

A Druid can't get a group? Boo-fucking-hoo, they go quad kite. If a Cleric
can't get a group, the poor bastard has to sit around LFG all day. Yeah...
Druids have it so fucking hard.

Tunare's Renewal and Kragg's Mending are Cleric class killing spells, and it
mystifies me why some reject designer (Rich Waters) thought it would be a
good idea to make things even harder on Clerics. Rich Waters... are you some
kind of dumbass? Hello, you make a class that gives up so much to be best in
healing, then you hand off amazing heals to classes that have it so easy in
comparison?

Clerics have things hard enough as it is. From level 1 they've sacrificed a
whole lot more than most classes just to be the best healers. Now Druids,
whom have an extremely easy route to high levels can replace Clerics so
easily -without- making any true sacrifices.

Now in case someone brings up the Hammer everyone loves holding against
Clerics, I think there needs to be a couple of myths dispelled first. The
original Hammer of Judgement was great, but it only out-damaged melees using
poor gear in comparison to Clerics in Vex Thal gear.

When the hammer was nerfed, Cleric's didn't even get an explanation why. It
was stealth nerfed, and they had to use Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/) to
even learn that they split the hammer into a separate line of spells. When
Harmony got nerfed, Rich Waters made a post on the Druid's Grove explaining
the new changes. So yeah, the nerf sucks... but too god damn bad. You at
least got an explanation - Clerics got bent over.

Let me assure you, I'm sure the world is crying for those poor Druids... how
do they ever live?

Druids have great heals, great nukes, AEs, great DSes, ports, evacs, SOW,
adequate buffs, adequate DOTs, Snare, invis, mana regen, and resist debuffs.

Clerics have superb heals, excellent HP buffs, a resistible DS, easily
resisted DDs, gimped anti-Undead capabilities, and gimped melee.

Now, I may have missed something from either class, but I believe that
pretty much sums up the Cleric disparity when compared to Druids.

The very nature of healing is situational and is based on the environment.
You can only heal the damage that is dealt and everything beyond that is
overkill. What difference does it make if a Druid can heal 2925 HPs and a
Cleric can heal 7,500 HPs? In the end, it makes no difference because CHes
in experience groups typically land in the 3,000 range. (Lance Berg, please
correct me if I'm wrong on that).

Of course, the raiding situation is different, however there is much more to
EverQuest than raids. In that respect, CH doesn't exactly land for full on
raids, anyhow.

In the future, perhaps you should look at the situation before saying, "I
don't think clerics have taken it "up the wazoo" lately." It really would
avoid some flames.

I have a hard time feeling sorry for anyone, especially Druids. However,
Clerics are the only class I would consider pitying.
