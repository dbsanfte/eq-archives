/agree.

i prefer to simply try to make my replies as simple as possible, and cut 
  until i am essentially replying to no more than 2 people, and 
hopefully a paragraph per person.

Not fond of people who paraphrase a long post, but sometimes it is 
better done that way. a few people i know can do a great job 
paraphrasing a long post using the format of:

bizbee said <paraphrase>

lance replied < paraphrase>

rumbledore countered with <paraphrase>

and I think -
  their text.

i run into that on my electronic publishing group. it probably helps 
that [other than it is moderated and fairly closed...] that the list is 
very serious, full of publishers and editors who do 'clarity' for a 
living and caters to a fairly closed group of people.
