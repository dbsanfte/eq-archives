"My" cats consist of over 50 different cats over the 26 years of my
life, up to a dozen at one time. I have also observed these behaviors
in the feral cats that lived in the woods behind my house and in the
cats owned by other residents of my neighborhood as well as my
friends.

Please, stop spouting off when you don't know the facts of where my
observations come from. In my experience, which I feel has been rather
extensive, antisocial behavior and total independance in cats tends to
be an exception. They are definately communial creatures. As has been
pointed out, there are degrees of "pack-ness". Housecats are pack
animals, just not to the rather high degree that wolves are.
