/camp desktop -  doesn't seem to work, when i type it in it still
takes me back to the login screen ?

I seem to have a lot of trouble talking to npcs. I type in a sentence
questioning about the key words, with the key words in it, but a lot
of the time they fail to respond. Is there some trick to this ?

Switching to windowed mode, I can't move the mouse cursor out of the
window. I was hoping to be able to use/switch to ICQ this way ?

Where can I find a sharpening stone ?

What's the best way to raise archery ? It's lagging badly behind all
my other skills.

Sometimes I get spell interrupted when I am standing perfectly still ?

Why is my combat music down in blackburrow totally off-key ? :)
