You've been listening to too many 1%'er Ubahguild warriors. Apparently
at the extreme high end of the game, there's fucked up Luclin ubermobs
and some situations in CT where taunt either doesn't work, or the mobs
are *so* finicky about certain actions that you *MUST* have some
ultrarare +Hate Weapons like Ben has from VT.

Everyplace else, taunt not only works, but it works well enough. We've
played around on raids with the warrior not taunting and things go to
shit quickly. (Done in safe situations, of course). Generally either the
rogue or a cleric get's eaten pretty fast when the MA doesn't taunt.
Warriors usually just don't do enough damage compared to some others to
justify being on top of the hate list without taunting.

As to that whole "taunt before breaking mez" thing....
/shrug
I always did it at least once, but I didn't know about the "assist the
mob" trick either in my MA days.  Wish I had.
