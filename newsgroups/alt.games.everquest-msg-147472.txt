And just so the two conversations don't get mixed together (regarding
the previously mentioned "taxi" channel) do NOT get your server's
graffe's wizard channel confused with that. A non-wizard logging into
the wizard channel and whining for a port will quickly find themselves
kicked. Repeat offenders will make the "No Port For Ju'" list just as
quickly.
