We're not talking about "just about anyone" here.  We're talking about
a specific poster making a specific reply to a specific post of mine
in a specific context.  Or is that concept too clear for you to
understand?

Sorry, but:
/quote Beebo
"I probably shouldn't get involved, but he's right."
/quote
/quote Lief
"...so true..."
/quote
quite clearly places them with Clydefrog for purposes of my comment.
For that matter, you have "lumped" yourself into the same group for
that particular purpose, as my comment referred specificly to Clyde's
absurd assertion that his comment was not insulting.

Again, the insult was incidental to my point.  The "lumping" was done
by them (and, of course, you, and thus now the plural you) when you
chose to defend the illogic I insulted.  I didn't lump them to insult
them, they lumped themselves around the nonsense I insulted (ok, I
tossed in some mild sarcasm after insulting their unreason, so sue me).


> There is quite a bit of substance to everyone's arguments.  Even yours.


Honestly, I am waiting to see the substance to yours.
