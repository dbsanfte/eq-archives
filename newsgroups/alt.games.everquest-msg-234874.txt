Rangers don't need taunt.  If they need aggro they have more reliable 
methods of getting it.  Generally rangers are more worried about shedding 
aggro than getting it.  At level 30, that's not so much an issue, but it 
is later on, particularly as a ranger approaches getting his first aggro 
reducing spell.
