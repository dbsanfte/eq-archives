In a recent patch, more hats were added to the 'trade in for new
graphics' list, and my cowl was one of them. What I was wondering was
this:

1: Does it go 'no-drop' when you trade-in?

The cowl is dropable, would be a waste to make it no-drop haste since I
see dragon gloves or cord of velocity in my future

2: What are the new graphics?

Regular ToV/Kael quest armour helm graphics, different colour.tint, or
completely new look? Has anyone seen them?
