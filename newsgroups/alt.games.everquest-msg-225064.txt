I think though that he's hoping for specific details about Vox and Naggy 
spawn times and respawn times.  In other words, since the public board 
doesn't list lady vox as a target, how do we know when she'll next be up 
in order to organize our own raid on her?

Winter and I are deliberately loitering at 52 because we have some 
friends who are lagging behind us, and we are giving them a chance to 
catch up a bit.  Luckily, the AA system means we can productively 
continue to gain experience for a bit while loitering... but I'm sure in 
both our cases, one reason for stopping specifically at 52 was that this 
is the Naggy/Vox dividing line.

I don't know about WF, but for me this is about the 10th alt, and no, I 
wouldn't want to make another mage in order to be able to try a mage in 
Vox/Naggy.  I've already got one who's in the correct level range!

Further, since we are playing on FV, no, we can't just casually make an 
alt to try something out; one character per account on this server. 
This also means that to a large extent characters here aren't twinked 
out like they are on other servers; I know my 52 shaman on Morel Thule 
has a standing regen three times as high as that of my 47 shaman friend 
who is the person I'm waiting at 52 for, and twice as many hp.  Having a 
65 cleric and 57 bard to gather gear or funds for you makes it a 
different game.  To make an alt on FV means a second account or deleting 
and rerolling, I don't think either would be worth doing just to kill 
two mobs.

They are both, however, in the tourist manuals of things not to be 
missed while on your way to 65, and to hit them means making a 
deliberate effort not to level too fast and forget to smell the roses.

Splendid One, 52 Gnomage with Run 3 and Regen 1... starting to get itchy 
about turning AA back off!
