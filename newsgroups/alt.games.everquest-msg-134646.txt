If a poster is at all conscientious (spelling checker is going to have
to save me on that one) the quoted material will be brief, so as to
allow you to jump to the portion you want without scrolling.
Unfortunately, relatively few people trim quotes very well.

For cases where you're reading an entire thread at once, you're
correct. However, many people read threads as new messages are added,
and having quoted material appear first is logical.
