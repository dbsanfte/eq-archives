Yup in coming week I gonna be selling everything spare I have for whatever
price I can get

take item 3 about FBSS, these used to be 10kpp and then the Silver Chitin
Hand Wraps came out, became less rare and now sell for 6.5kpp making the
FBSS less attractive and as low as 4.5kpp

Same goes for Lamentation, lot of high lvl melees recevied Velious weapons
that were better so have been ditching the lammys so price dropped from
15kpp to 6kpp or less
