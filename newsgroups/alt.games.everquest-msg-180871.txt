In a way it's like parking in a handicapped parking space. Everyone
knows it's against the law, yet people still do it. A few get caught,
but the majority get away with it.

The EQ player-base is HUGE (400k+). If 5% (prob a conservative
estimate) of the current player base is made up of sold/traded/gift
characters and people that trade in PP/items on auction sites, that
would be roughly 20k+ accounts that should be banned according to the
EULA.

Is it worth the time and resources needed to track down those accounts
(which continue to pay their monthly fee) in order to enforce the
EULA? Would you want your local police force spending all of their
time cruising parking lots looking for people illegally parked in
handicap spaces? How many GMs and CS reps would it take, and would
Sony want to cut revenue by 5%?

In general the people that buy/sell/trade accounts/items/pp keep under
the radar, and don't make a fuss. No one gets hurt, and the rest of
the player base (that adheres to the EULA) is never the wiser.

On the other hand, if an account as described above is involved in a
CS issue (such as a player that sells an account then steals it back),
then enforcing the EULA is a quick and efficient way of dealing with
the problem.
