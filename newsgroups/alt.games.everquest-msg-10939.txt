After getting my Shaman up to level 9, I was amazed at the amount of begging
going on in BB. I dont mind the occassional ask for SoW, but I personally
dont think it is too much to ask them to come to my location for a buff.

"can i have a sow plz"

"Sure, I'm at the snake ledge, I'll get it memmed for ya."

"im in the (insert camp area here), come to me cant leave"

"On second thought, no I can't give you a SoW"

"plz plz plz plz"

/ignore Iamanidiotbeggar

Good grief it is all I can do to keep my tanks fully buffed, and keep the
mobs DOT'd.
