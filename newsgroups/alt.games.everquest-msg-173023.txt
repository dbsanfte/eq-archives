Hmmm...suddenly I'm thinking of the short story "The Singing Bell" by Isaac
Asimov...

Have you considered chess?  Inexpensive or even free programs are available
that play at grandmaster level, so could easily keep you occupied for three
months, especially if you got into studying the game seriously (warning: the
chess book habit can get expensive!).

Go is also good for this, but the Go programs aren't as good relative to
humans as the Chess programs are.  If you turn out to have a talent for the
game, in three months you could be significantly better than the programs.
Also, good Go books are harder to come by in English.

One nice thing about both Chess and Go is that if you do get into them, you
can have a lot of fun away from your computer.  There are books on strategy
and tactics, openings, and end games.  There are books of problems and
puzzles.  You might also find a local club or two where you can go play
other people, or even play in a tournament.  (Another warning: I've seen
people sucked into Chess way deeper than I've seen anyone get sucked into
EQ, so be careful!)

How about non-PC games?  You might pick up a Gameboy Advance.  Nintendo has
been releasing some of the classic Super Nintendo games for GBA.  If you've
never played Super Mario World or The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,
they alone justify getting a Gameboy.  They won't last three months, but
there are a zillion other games.
