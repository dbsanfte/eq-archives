It changes radically at 51 when you get turgur's insects. Slows equal to an
enchanter 5 levels above you, casts faster, resists less, uses less mana.
At higher levels, when you stop playing in the nice safe outdoors,
enchanters really HATE slowing, because they aren't very good at it, it
causes enourmous aggro, and they already get beat on enough (and can barely
take whatever beating they get). Enchanters do clarity, tash, haste, and
crowd control...and that is pretty much it (granted, all 4 of those are
useful things).

Incapacitate is useless. Period. Its big brother Cripple is only useful in
maybe 2 dozen fights in the entire game, incapacitate is the defining edge
of "waste of mana"...unless you are on a red server of course. The stat
debuffs fuck players up hard.

High level shamans kill things enchanters (until they get dire charm) can't
even have in visible range without dying.

You really waste mana on the malise line for dreadlands shit? What really
changes at 49 is the RADICALLY improved pet, and envenomed bolt. Envenomed
bolt is The Shit.
