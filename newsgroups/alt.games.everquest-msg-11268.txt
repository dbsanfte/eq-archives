For the best zone explorer, go here:
www.hackersquest.gomp.ch
Check out the EthernalQuest emulator.
This will emulate the Everquest servers and allow you to go through
every zone.
Here is a link to the best thread about getting it up and running:
http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/001454.html

Download the poster's FAQ and read it first.
Then you can start reading some of the other threads about making it
so you can go into the velious zones and such.
It is a truly great program.
Please, though, if you are going to ask any questions there, make sure
you do a search for an answer first.
Good luck, and enjoy.
