    Might I suggest a change of diet to Bear Steak. Bear Meat, Spices, Jug
of Sauces, makes a Hearty Meal (not as good as the fish rolls, but still
lasts a long time) that also gives STR plus one. Bear Meat is found in
infinite supply on the new "meat vendors" that are found in places like
Thurg and Shadowhaven - both those zones also have vendors for Spices and
Jug of Sauces.

    If you ever need to find a trade skill supply....

    ...has them all listed, both by zone and by trade.
