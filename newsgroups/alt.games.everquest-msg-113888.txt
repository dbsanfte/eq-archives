I'd ditch the centi and use a wurmslayer instead.  Slightly higher
ratio, with a nice long delay.  Not only that, but it's nice to see
hits for 95ish with a 1hs weapon.  :-)

My ranger is currently using a Wurmy in his main hand and a Centi SS
in the off hand.  I don't see me trading out the wurmy for some time
either.
