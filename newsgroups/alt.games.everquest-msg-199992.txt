Yes.   The Dark Masters are considered to be chanting if they have done the
zonewide "chant" emote at least once, and Doomshade has not yet been
triggered.

Yes, they'll repeat the zonewide emote once every so often.   I can't tell
you how long between repeats, since I've never actually seen Doomshade
survive for two zonewide emotes...

This part is incorrect.  If the dark masters have chanted and Doomshade has
not been spawned since they did, then he can be.   It can be an hour after
they first chanted, or two hours (I guess that would assume 3 hours in
between chants) but he can be spawned.   The only  requirement is to kill
all four Dark Masters before the first respawns.  (about a 15 minute window)

The first is incorrect.  The second is much closer to the truth.   The
chanting isn't really involved in the event, it is only to let you know that
Doomshade is available.

While he is available, the Dark Masters will chant about once every 3 hours,
to inform the zone.  Once he has been spawned (not killed, a failed attempt
blows the spawn as well.)  then the Dark Masters will cease chanting for
about 3 days.   Once the three day "respawn" timer on the event expires,
then they will resume chanting once every 3 hours until he spawns.
