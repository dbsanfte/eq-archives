Do not move, but do make a point of swiveling around.  Taking
a split second to turn a bit in place without any forward or backward
(or strafe) movement ensures that the system gets the message
that you are in fact stationary.

In combat, you will often be hit hard enough to move you a bit,
which will count as a move even if you didn't touch the movement
keys.  Constant swiveling minimizes the chance this will count
as an interrupt if it didn't actually happen during your cast.

For Hybrids, casting has minimal effect on weapon attacks.  Your
weapon cycle time is paused during cast, no you don't get free
casts, but you don't get scrod the way a melee cleric does, for
example... if I'm pounding away and decide to drop a stun in,
my weapon delay cycle resets back as if I had just swung.  Since
I concentrate on -long- delay weapons, this hurts me even more.

Same is true of defense, by the way.  Arranging to get swung at a lot
while growing up is something many non-melee overlook, myself included.
After spending the past 20 levels actually making some effort to increase
defense I'm still at only 150, while my offense is maxed out for my class.
At least its semi respectable, at 29 when I first realized I'd overlooked it
it was at no better than 30.  When anything -looked- at me funny I'd
take damage!
