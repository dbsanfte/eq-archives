Hmm ok the obvious, get Dex and Agi boosted though the roof, Use fast
weapons, find low xp light hitting dark blue mobs, forget everything
except 1HB, 2HS and 1HS then ditch everything but 2HS. Really man if
we had 10 weapons classes some people would want em all at max. It
aint worth the grief havent seen a high level pally with anything but
2HS in forever, yeah I know jim-bob prob saw one but why. The new 2HS
weapons are a sight to behold, go with them.

My personal favorite skill is defense(duh), that and one maybe 2
weapon classes and the rest takes care of itself. Rangers need 3
weapon classes but thats another thread aint it.
