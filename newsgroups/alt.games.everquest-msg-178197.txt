It depends on the domain.  It's common for in-house IT departments to bring
down web sites and services without too much concern.  It's unheard of in
transaction processing.  It isn't clear what standard EQ should be held to.
From my experience EQ is down more frequently than the average of "real
software development projects."

Anyone with broad experience will know it's true in certain domains and
false in others.

They don't place enough value on it avoid 10 hours of continuous downtime or
multiple outages per month.
