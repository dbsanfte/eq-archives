Only if you believe in the person as divinity...

The one in charge of the *final* judgement, assuming you believe
in the faith.  A Christian, Jew, or Moslem charged to live according
to the law doesn't get the "well, I didn't think it meant that"
defense.  All decisions final and all that...

Of course, the alternative view is that social structures are
inherently more moral (since they are focused on group dynamics)
than the primative "me first" credo without a social implication.

No, in fact, he didn't, at least according to the Bible.  He
added a law while explicitly retaining the old.  That would explain
its normal 'title' of the Eleventh Commandment.
