Holy crap!

Everyone told me the exp was insane, but last night I got PLed by a new 
friend (Hi, I'm bored and friends with one of your guildies... Want to get 
PLed?) there and the exp was INSANE.

Admittedly, the PLer was dualboxing a 51 Druid and a 50-s Chanter, and my 
pet was getting thorns, heals, etc whil;e it beat on mobs and I ran around 
with C2 pulling things with my snare dot (and as a man with a monk main, 
good ol Xartik was ALWAYS busy), but still, this was an INSANE evening.
