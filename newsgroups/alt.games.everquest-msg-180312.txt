You're assuming that they're not doing that. You're also assuming that
experience in coding the relatively small projects common in a
recreational coding or academic environment is directly transferable to
the sort of large project of which EQ is an example.

Poor documentation makes the job harder.

That isn't the same thing as good documentation making the job *easy*.
Easier, yes. But only relatively so.

The original code was (we hope) written to a specification and documented.
Since then, there have been extensive changes, and the original code,
probably fairly "clean", has been changed repeatedly.

To put it another way, if a formal method was used (inputs and outputs
documented for each function) additions will change the inputs and/or
outputs for that function, which may affect code elsewhere that relies
on those assumptions. The final code after patching to extend past the
original specification is unlikely to be as "clean" as it would be if
the extensions had been included in the original specification.

Basically if you take code designed to do A and change it to do B (which
is similar but not identical to A) the code won't be as clean as if it
had been designed for B originally. Extend that for some arbitrarily
large number of iterations and you may not have spaghetti code, but it
won't be pretty. It may be well documented... but not pretty. And unless
they're very lucky, it won't be easy to maintain either.
