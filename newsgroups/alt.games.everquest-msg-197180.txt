I did notice a major change with the pathing.

I had a newbie Beastlord that used to travel through the tunnels in
Shadeweavers Thicket, with his pet trailing behind him.  Invariably,
the pet would become hopelessly lost, no matter how many times you
stopped to wait for the pet to follow you.  Similar things would
happen in Paludal caverns.

I recently started a magician on the newbie server, and decided to
bring him to the Shadeweavers side of Paludal cavenrs.  Now, my
magician pet never has gotten lost.  he follows me around corners,
etc.

I can't say I've noticed if the same thing happens now with pulled
mobs, but according to Verant, it's the same logic for both.  It might
be true, but I just haven't been able to verify this.
