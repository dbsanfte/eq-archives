My iksar was ally but that was nerfed to a max of warmly. He just killed
lots of orcs or threw shurikens at ones engaged with other people, or did
other stuff to be on their hate list. I did it for roleplaying reasons. I
also found CB belts and pads are often on vendors and can get you great
xp/faction once you get to dubious if you are a sneaky race/class, or
apprehensive otherwise.  Never found a good way to get decent dwarf rogue
faction, especially as they nerfed the handing in of stacks of 4 items...
that really sucked. Presumably they felt the game was marginally less
tedious if you hand in stacks of 4 than one, and so it got the chop.

Note: despite backpacks of bone chips, i don't even have decent faction in
cabilis. Killing CB orcs gives the easiest positive faction hits I know of.
As for the dark elves, pffft. Being a troll around their city is a pain; i
scrapped my newbie troll warrior in protest about being assigned a home city
where i was barely tolerated and (in sections) KOS, not counting the ducking
all the time.

CB is a fun area, it's social, good for learning group skills, outdoors so
you can be sowed/wolfed, and so on. Also there's a charm that relies on wood
elf faction, so you will sometimes see people gathering all the orcs
together and balsting them with earthquakes etc. If some druid wants
faction, he should work with a warrior type; the orcs will aggro on him and
the druid can heal/thorn/skin, or even just nuke and let you loot; the
belts/pads are bulk xp, although walking in kelethin means watch out for
that darn bard.

p.s. if you ever want great bard faction, go to mistmoor and either fight or
powerlevel. The faction hits help with many dragons too.
