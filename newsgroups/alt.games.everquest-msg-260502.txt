It was a quote from a SOE employee at a Fan Faire.  It's also been
contradicted by another SOE employee.

I use /time in my FD hotkey since they added the 2-minute clear so I can
check how long I've been down (don't need to often, but it's a just-in-case
thing).  I parse a higher failure rate in Sol Ro Tower than any other zone I
have any semi-lengthy parses in.  I parse an overall failure rate of ~5%,
and a failure rate of ~7% in Sol Ro.  These are very rough parses, and will
tend to be skewed toward showing more successes than actually happen (since
I will, as I said, use /time to see how long I have to wait, and as well
will sometimes hit my FD key right before it pops and have to hit it again
immediately, which will parse as an extra success).

So, whether the first SOE employee was right, or the second one was right,
is completely irrelevant to me.  I fail feign more in some zones than
others.  Fact.  Whether it's a bug or intentional doesn't matter to me in
the slightest.  =)
