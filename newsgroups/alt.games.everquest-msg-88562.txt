I'm having this same problem.  But I'm getting combat
music in some zones and not in others.  For instance,
I get music in North Ro, but not in Oasis; I get music
in Everfrost, but not in Qeynos Hills - weird!  All other
music seems fine and sound effects are all working properly.

I'm running EQ in 1024x768 with all Luclin options turned on
using a P4-1.8, WinME, 512MB, GeForce2 MX400/64 with the 23.11
Nvidia drivers, and an SB-Live sound card.
