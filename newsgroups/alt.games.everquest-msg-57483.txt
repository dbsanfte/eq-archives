  If you're on the Nameless, I've got one of those--bone talisman, 
secondary slot, +4 WIS, +10 versus magic. It's a relatively easy quest, 
but getting the tiger skin is a pain in the ass. I've been trying to get 
rid of it now that I've got the Testament, but no one seems to want to 
buy. Any idea what a fair price for this thing is?

  Yep, he's my primary. I got all that through a lot of saving, some 
donations for binding and SoWing, and a couple of lucky equipment drops 
that I managed to sell off (like the crude stein I got from a couple of 
guard-killers in Oggok while I was passing through doing the Stein of 
Moggok quest).
