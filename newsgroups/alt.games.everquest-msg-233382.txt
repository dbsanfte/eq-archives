You might reconsider about Run3. Its always on. You never have to
think about it. No matter where you are, what you are doing or what
your current state is, its there for you. Run3 never gets dispelled,
or wears off at the worst time (as spells have a nasty habit of
doing). You can be naked and OOM, and Run3 is there for you.

It could save your life one day.
