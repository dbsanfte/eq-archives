}My brother came up with what I thought was a fantastic idea on the
}alpha system (we also happen to be on Ayonae Ro).  Instead of
}starting with the first person in the alphabet, random to see who goes
}first and alpha from there.  This way everyone has a chance at starting
}the chain.
}Its just one of those ideas you slap your forehead and say 'duh' :-)

Yeah, I've had that idea too, but suggesting it in groups is usually met 
with blank stares and Looter tells the group, "gem to Aaamefirst".

}(btw, we use master looter in LDoN and has served us well!)

Heh.  It's worked really well in guild groups.  50% success rate in pickup 
groups so far though.  So far, deciding to look for a pickup group in LDoN 
looks like a surefire strategy for assuring myself a miserable evening, 
one way or the other. :/ Maintank tells the group, "Quick, memblur this 
KoS mob that I'm hitting so we can skip it and head for the boss"... Sigh.
