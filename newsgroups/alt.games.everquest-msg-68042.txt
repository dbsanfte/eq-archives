    Other than looks, you are considered sitting for purposes of medding
while mounted on a horse. So you can run across a zone, medding all the way.
Due to the initial acceleration when horses start moving I doubt you could
quad on one, though. When mounted you also have a low-level Safe Fall. You
cannot use Levitate while mounted, though.

    I've heard but not personally confirmed that one cannot be slowed by
encumberance in the zone where horses are sold.
