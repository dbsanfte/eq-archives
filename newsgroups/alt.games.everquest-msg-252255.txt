By that theory... you can never sell your house either. Even if you
'own' it. After all... the house is in possession of the government
which controls the land. The governing body will typically issue
'deeds' to the land, which can be bought and sold... and likewise SoE
will issue accounts, of which items on them can be traded. Who has
possession? The guy who can trade the item until SoE revokes that
privilege. Who recieves it? The guy who buys it on the account he
controls.
