Not sure about the scale coif problem, but I know about the Velious armor
problem.  With the release of Luclin they never loaded the textures for
Velious armor for the new graphics models.  So the only way to fix that at
the moment is to turn off all the new character models and then when you
come back into the game you have to zone.  Personally for me it's not a big
deal, I'm not into armor because it looks good, I'm into it because of the
stats:)  But for my wife whom just bought her rygor BP and was sorely
disappointed in not being able to see it, well she turned off all the
models.  Plus she hates the new iksar models anyway, as do I.

PS.  Verant knows about the textures not being loaded but stated since it's
such a small problem and easily fixed they're not going to do it yet.  What
kinda sense does that make?
