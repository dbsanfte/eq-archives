Copied over from my guild board where I quipped the acronym could be
Dragons of Norrath: Everquest, aka D.O.N.E. comes the following

"... if you parse out the last few expansion acronyms right, it reads
   kind of like a masochistic relationship:
   Consumer: I'm not sure I'm gonna like this.
   Sony: Tough. You bought it. If you don't like it you're SOL. Bend over!
   *POP*
   Consumer: GOD! OOW! That's it, I'm DONE!
   (Well, okay, LDON kinda messes it up, but I always forget that expansion.)"
