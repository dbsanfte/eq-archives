God, I don't want to change newsreaders, but, I am getting extremely
tempted.  In OE, I can set it to ignore a thread, but, it will still insist
on taking me to unread messages in the thread when I go to next unread
message.  There does not appear to be a way to make a message rule based on
crossposting, or to make a rule for a thread.  If it weren't just so damned
easy to use otherwise....
