First comment: This patch message is a hoax, obviously. Verant would
*NEVER* do that many incredibly useful and customer friendly things in
one patch. Obvioulsy somebody was drunk when they published this to the
Dev boards.

Let the MASSIVE whinging of the uberguilds begin, (Especially the Euro
and some Asian ones who usually get first jump) followed a few
nanoseconds later by the popping of champagne corks among the tier two
guilds trying to claw their way up.

Yes, but will you still be ported up if you *do* have Luclin but don't
have a shard upon your person?

I'm going to lavastorm tonight to check this out. Of course, it had to
happen six days after Tiru spent a THOUSAND FUCKING PLAT on lavarocks
from some wizzy in Skyfire.

No impact on the real problem with Ragefire, which will need to be
addressed in Skyfire.
