Actually, no. But it could be confusion in semantics, so if that is the
case, I'll elaborate. You have, certainly, "typed words" after the
arguments to your *opinions* in most every post. I was referring to
actually addressing the comments which are contrary to your *opinions*
rather than simply saying brilliant stamements like "100% horseshit" and
"chicken little the sky is falling".  It's called "debate". Look into
it. Lots of fun. :-)

Yes.

Yes, though it's your *opinion* (someday, since we put a man on the
moon, we may get Ben to realize that the spellbook being "the dumbest
design decision in history" is his opinion.) We can keep saying the same
things over and over again, yet you won't acknowledge them. I can only
assume that you can't. The phrases "rites of passage" and "roleplaying"
figure large here, but they won't be commented on you in any specific
fashion, since they are "100% horseshit" and "chicken little" or
something.

You seem a big fan of quoting about the *original* game having a
spellbook all the way to fifty. What do you suppose was the magical
design limitation that made VI *HAVE* to have it to 35? Or was it maybe
the company stated point about roleplay? Hrmmmm... learing to meditate
to master your spell memorizing and casting ability. Beyond that, it
goes back to rite of passage, which a lot of people have chimed in
agreeing with. But.... oh, that's right. It's "100% horseshit". This is
getting tedious. Your points have been answered. You come back with
nothing but disparaging remarks without answering the specifics issues
raised against your... (here it comes again... fasten your seatbelt.)
OPINION.

Which, of course, you have in great basketfulls. Pity we can't all be as
bright and visionary as you. And of course the 100% horseshit and
chicken little stuff wasn't rhetoric.  Naaaaaaaaw.

Boat..... paddle.... get out the yellow pages.

Obviously. They slowed you down from making 60 faster. They MUST be
stupid.

Roleplaying and the society that has involved inside the game. But this
will get blown over as "100% horseshit" and "chicken little" as well, no
doubt.

Gee. Glad we're the only ones engaging in "generalizations" here. Your
answer isn't an answer at all. Only insult and a lack of rationale
relevant to the question at hand.
 
> It's a catchphrase. 

And we're communicating on this subject in a written newsgroup using a
*gasp* "LANGUAGE". They contain catchphrases for a reason, since the
majority of the people reading it knows what it means and saves a
paragraph explaining what a "slippery slope" is to the reading impaired.

Ah yes. We never will learn from history. Why bother? If the brick is
falling off the ledge towards Ben's head, accellerating at roughly 10
meters per second squared, well....... there's no proof that it's GOING
to hit him, is there??!!?? Why should I yell look out? I'd just be
chicken little.

Learn from the past or repeat it.

See above. I wasn't there when it was. Ask Verant. It's part of the
culture now and fully valid in some people's opinions.  VI has given a
roleplaying reason for it. You don't like it. Yes, we get that much. I
think it's only your criticism with all of those who don't agree with
you that some might find distasteful.

People got used to it. Just like they will get used to this even more
dumbed down version. VI is doing it. There's no stopping it. We're
simply airing a public discussion on the merits from both sides. Well...
some of us, anyways.
 
> What? There was no doom? Everything went fine?

Oh. Are you the final arbiter that "everything went fine"? Or are you
basing that simply on the fact that the game still exists?
 
> Not much of a slippery slope....

You've already shown you really don't have much of a grasp of, or belief
in, that concept, so it's hard to take you seriously when you now invoke
it at the end of your post.
