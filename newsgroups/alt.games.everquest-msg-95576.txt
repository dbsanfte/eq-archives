That's an oversimplification that does not give a true picture of the
situation...

So what's 'kiting' then? If I have SoW up, and the mob is snared, then
that's another situation where I can get from X to Y with no way for the mob
to catch me... but then I'm oversimplifying the point as well... so my
example makes about as much sense as your does ;o)

Are you saying that the ONLY legal way to kill a monster is in toe-to-toe
melee? Is casting from range an exploit? Is using a pet an exploit? By your
logic anyone who hides behind a pet... thereby blocking any "straight line"
between you and the mob... should be banned instantly for deliberate and
repeated exploits.

The only way to CROSS the moat is if you have a reasonably high AGL and are
not overweight... and there's only a couple of places where it can be done
with a reasonable chance of not falling in. And when you DO fall in, the AI
pathing changes immeadiatly to 'dive in the water after him'.
