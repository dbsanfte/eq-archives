Right, just as we think -you- have a problem for asking questions like, 'are 
you still not listening to a word I say?'

}> It's just a question, see?  It even has a '?' at the end.
}Yes I know it is a question.  However, can you explain either the relevance
}here or what you are trying to say?

I'm trying to say that just because it's in the form of a question, that does 
not excuse it from the possibility of also being an accusation.  It is a 
simple, easily understood example of a question that is also an accusation, 
and in fact, one that has been used to make this point, in this group in the 
past.

And I do not feel that someone providing a partial answer to your question 
warranted such an accusation.
