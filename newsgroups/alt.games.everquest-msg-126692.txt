Neat.  What's sama?

}None the less, they have been brainwashed.  Anyways, it's amazing what you

*choke* Err... you mean those western notions of reason and logic that 
were mostly, as I understand it, gleaned by Greek scholars from Arab 
texts?  Now, I'm only going on a vague recollection there, so correct me 
if I'm wrong...

On the other hand, the socratic method has done such a -swell- job of 
teaching our American lads...  Why, some of them graduate high school and 
are actually able to read...

I meet, from time to time, fellow graduate students who have had to suffer 
through this inferior Arab education.  It's amazing how eager our 
universities are to recruit them.  And on top of that, they tend to give 
me the impresssion that they're pretty well-educated.  They must just be 
fooling me, somehow...
