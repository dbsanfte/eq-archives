*strange look*... Planned?

On 99% of the raid mobs beyond epic weapon raids, (which probably aren't
even considered raids these days anymore), planning is a near impossiblity.

The mob your guild is after pops once every 3 days or once every week, and
thier life span is measured in minutes.   The spawns are also random within
a period of several hours.

The only real planning you can do is to know when it was last killed, to
know what *might* spawn today...   and thats sure as hell not information
they will be giving out at thier website, or in random tells from
non-guildmembers.
