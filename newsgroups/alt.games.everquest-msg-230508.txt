Yee-hawr, back from vacation, and with bad news to boot (or good news, if
you happen to dislike me).

I don't think I'll be spending much more time here. :(  With the new year
comes the usual changes and resolutions.  The change being that I'm
drifting away from EQ, and the resolution being to stop wandering around
online while I'm at work.  Since I have a mental block against writing on
boards/newsgroups after 5:30 (due to years of playing EQ), this almost
guarentees I won't be heard from.  Lurk a little, yes, post often enough
that folks remember my name, no.

As for EQ...account ain't cancelled, but the "joie de everqueste" has gone
out of me.  You know you are done for when you don't *have* to cancel your
account to stop playing. I'm going to keep it around for a while just in
case that switch flips back on (I mean, it could...obviously it did once
before), and until I can see what nifty toy it gives me in EQ2 if I have
an EQ account still.  

So yar, this could be the end of Foxeye on a.g.e. :(  It isn't so much a
conscious decision to "leave", but more a prediction.  Don't say anything
nasty about me behind my back, though, y'hear?  And enjoy yourselves,
except when you don't...because if you enjoyed yourself all the time you'd
never appreciate it?  

And, eh, YCHMSIYCCMIWID (You Can Have My Stuff If You Can Catch Me Ingame
When I'm Drunk).
