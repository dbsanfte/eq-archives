Poisons are fantastic in duels/PvP.  Most people don't know what we can do
with poisons.  Hell, I fought another rogue last month and he had NO idea
what had happened when I nailed him with Blind.

Poisons won't make soloing practical, but for the times where you can't find
a pickup group, they'll help

Poisons are helpful for when your group is missing a caster for a specific
effect.  Got that named mob but he tends to run?  No snarer?  Use Muscle
Lock.

A few of the poisons are cheap and easy to find.  Weaken I takes spider
venom sacs which you can often find at vendors, and it'll take off
1STR/level (up to 33).  Snake sacs for Injected I are fairly plentiful (at
vendors) and can do up to (Level+1) DD + up to 190DoT over 5 ticks.
Components for Spine Break (Root) can be bought in WK and can save your butt
if a solo attempt goes bad.

While it is expensive, it's not just for twinks.  As potters, we can make
our own vials and save half the funds.  I just wish they'd make it possible
to brew the suspensions ourselves.

Remember:  A ROGUE WITHOUT POISON IS JUST A WEAK WARRIOR.
