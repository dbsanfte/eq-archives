Umm, why on earth do you put Wizard so low on that list?  below a ranger?!?!
With all due respect i feel you may just be very uneducated in the Wizards
capabilities.  In outdoor zones ie, The Overthere, Lake of Ill omen,
Dreadlands etc etc.. the Wizard is the best soloer bar none... (This is
coming from a guy who plays a 55 Wizard and a 56 Necromancer)  As i stated
in a previous post, My wizard can solo very nearly twice as many blue
conning mobs in a 10 minute period than my necromancer can.  You put Shaman,
Monk, Shadow Knight and ranger above a wizard but.... can you name any of
those closes that can solo 4 Blue conning mobs at once using only 2 bubbles
of their mana?

An Example of a lvl 54 Wizard in Cobalt Scar:

Wizard Runs around and aggros 4 Wyverns either with the use of a low lvl
fast casting spell or the right click insta cast staff "Staff of Temperate
flux".  He then proceeds to run a large circle around the wyverns to bunch
them....  When they are bunched he runs of in a straight line to gain some
distance.  When he is far enough away he turns and caste Bonds of Force
(Area Effect Snare) All four mobs are then snared.  Next he proceeds to cast
an AE pillar spell on the wyverns, at lvl 54 this would be Pillar of
Lightning (833 damage to each mob with each cast, for 325 mana) the wizard
casts Pillar of Lighting 4 times and all 4 of the wyverns die at once.
Leaving the Wizard at about 60% mana (depending on the wizards gear)

Now please tell me again that a ranger can solo better than a wizard.

P.S this is not a flame or a rate...just an attempt at education of the
Wizard class...i apologize if it comes across badly
