Looking at the spell history, it seems that it originally was a 40 
attack 40 haste 7 ac buff spell effect, but they changed it to just the 
AC, probably coding the attack and haste onto the item instead.

This would mean that originally it would have stacked haste with worn 
haste, so a BER would be at.. well I have a COFW so I'm at 36% now and 
would be at 76% unbuffed with epic.  But a cast haste would either 
overwrite that haste, making the haste on epic irrelevant, or worse the 
epic would overwrite and prevent a "real" haste landing, making that 
part of the epic a liability.

After the change it would count as item haste, so my COFW is the item 
that becomes irrelevant while I have epic equipped, but I'm fully ready 
for any cast haste.

I don't think there's trouble stacking attack either way, unless perhaps 
it put the attack part in a popular slot and caused issues there.

I just think its funny that they now have an effect on the epic which 
looks like nothing but an AC buff that is worse than what a level 10 
cleric would cast!
