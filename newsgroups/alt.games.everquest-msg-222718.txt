Seem to be a lot of people out there that disagree.  Can't say that I've 
done a comprehensive search to dig up the details.  Did find a couple of 
placing telling you how to modify your 2000 Home install to be a 2000 Pro 
install.  Microsoft certainly appears to have no info on 2000 Home, so, 
not sure what that is all about.
