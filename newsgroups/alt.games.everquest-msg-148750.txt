Tweety part two.

/sigh

She makes a lot of valid points about CS, but let's face it. It's not
going to be the end of the game, she's overeacting in a big way, and I
think there's a mixture of sour grapes in there as well. 

Yes, I thought the guide program sucks also, and the responsiveness of
Sony's CS is practically non-existant, but I don't see any of the
current items under discussion being some sweeping change, nor the end
of the (Norrathian) world as we know it.
