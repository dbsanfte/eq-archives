Anybody know where a reliable set of Haste item comparisons
can be found?  The one at eq.castersrealm.com seemed to be
what I wanted, but I didn't think Silver Chitin Handwraps
were better haste than a Sash of the Dragon Born and almost
as good as a Cloak of Flames.  Anybody know a better
reference, hopefully one backed up by parsing?
