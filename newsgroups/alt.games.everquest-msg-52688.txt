    How about "because he wants an item with premanent water breathing on
it"? It's a class of items that is quite exclusive, needed for a few
applications (as a rogue he needs a Kedge robe for his epic, and one place
to get it is entirely underwater), and in my experiences is NOT commonly
sold in EC. When my cleric camped Hadden (thank Brell he dropped it first
time), it was so she could do the Lake Rathe portion of her epic, and she
was high enough level to drop him in one cast.
