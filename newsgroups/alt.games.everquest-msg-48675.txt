    Greens. Always used it to kill greens, as for a cleric greens are a true
hassle to kill. When I fought in Unrest, I took out the Death Beetles on the
party as well as inflicting SOME damage on our pulls. When I needed Qeynos
faction, I wiped out the Bandit camp in NK. And when I did our Holy Symbol
of Brell quest, I gacked all three goblins in BB at once with one cast.
