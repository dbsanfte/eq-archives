This is particularly interesting, because I accepted, more or less at 
face value Loral's assertion that he *could not* play effectively in 
modern one group content due to the equipment gap.

*IF* we accept Loral at face value then there is a legitimate problem, 
and Faned's attitude of calling them out as whiners who feel entitled to 
something is off base. *IF* they can't do 1-groupable content in 1-
groupable gear then we *do* have a problem.

You however are asserting that you do in fact group in these zones, with 
gear that you claim is largely beneath or on par 1-groupable gear. 
*That* undermines Loral's premises a fair bit.

That said, to be fair we do have to consider what is -reasonable- 1-
groupable gear. Do you claim that your equipment of the caliber you are 
wearing is reasonably attainble... just because you *can* do LDoNs for a 
year solid and walk out with elementalish quality gear doesn't mean 
that's reasonable to expect of anyone. :)

DoN, as you noted has raised the bar of attainable equipment 
considerably, without quite as much grinding as was required in LDoN.

I also personally can't name a place where you cannot one group without 
raid gear, where you should be able to... because I personally haven't 
encountered such a place. But then my regular group wipes pretty 
routinely too... so maybe we really aren't "playing effectively" by this 
standard?

Lets separate 'access' from 'play effectively in', because both you and 
Faned mentioned the PoP progression issues, and that's really not whats 
being discussed here.

They *aren't* complaining about not being able to zone in. PoP is behind 
us.

-----------

However there are 2 side issues that afflict 1-group players.

The first is the 'perception' of adequacy. 

I have guildmates who have been turned down for groups in 1-groupable 
content based on their hp/ac/mana etc. These are people with better gear 
than me. However, I've taken groups of friends to these very same places 
and found that I was able to hold up and we were able to fight 
effectively. (And I'm not as well equipped as some of the players that 
got turned down.)

There is a reality that EVEN if your gear IS good enough to fight 
effectively, if you are getting turned down for groups because other 
people don't think your gear is good enough then you've still got a 
legitimate problem.

Second 1-group progression isn't terribly interesting, when LDoN came 
out, sure you could get elemental-ish armour... but instead of crawling 
and mastering 15+ diverse zones fighting interesting and unique stuff 
you were relegated to grinding 15,000 points doing collections in a 
cookie cutter dungeon. Its mindless, tedious, and ultimately 
unrewarding. Now LDoN is obsolete... we have DoN. Oh whee.

If it was really a matter of crawling through velious, luclin, pop, god, 
oow 1-groupable content, paralell to the raid game it would be a lot 
more bearable... but LDoN pretty much obsoleted all 1-groupable drops 
before it came out, and DoN seems to have done the same. (And even if 
you WANTED to run a more traditional progession you'd be SoL finding a 
group to do it with because they're all lined up doing DoN...)

These 2 issues are relevant because even if 1-group gear is enough, the 
HOW its attained still needs significant reworking. But I'll concede 
that's a separate issue.

Whats important to establish is: Is current 1-groupable gear actually 
adequate? Loral asserts it isn't...  Graeme implies it is... Faned 
doesn't much care :p ... 

And I, from personal experience would probably side with Graeme, but I 
have the luxury of a regular group that is both -very- good at working 
together, and willing to try just about anything. And that compensates 
for quite a lot of gear. I've seen small raids populated with level65s 
destroyed by stuff we 3-manned untwinked in our mid-fifites. (Which just 
goes to show you how bad some pickup raids can be...)  

Perhaps Graeme also has that luxury??

In the 1-group game there are 2 classes of player... one which is 
comprised of high caliber competent players who would be successful at 
the raid game if they pursued it, and another class which simply isn't 
as competent. Unlike the guild organized raid game where you rarely have 
random idiots along these two classes of 1-group player mix pretty 
freely, unless they're fortunate enough to have a regular group.

At the risk of sounding like a competent-1-grouper-snob it strikes me 
that the 1-groupable equipment probably is good enough in the hands of 
very good players, probably even good players. But in situations where 
you are mixxing in weaker player elements the combination of the 
inherent relative weakness of 1-groupable gear and the odds of having 
weak players in the group combines to doom them to perpetual failure. 

Good players in this scenario would surely think there isn't much they 
could do to improve their fellow players so they see the better gear 
lorded over them by the raiders as the only solution, perhaps rightfully 
so. Weaker players on the other hand likely earn some of the abuse Faned 
heaps on their "whining"... because this group, at least, really does 
want to substitute better gear for learning to play better...

I guess as far that goes, whether EQ should 'punish' the weakest players 
by only giving them the crappiest gear is a complex question. Most games 
increase the challenge the more advanced you are... EQ does the reverse. 
Proving you can defeat a challenge rewards you with items that make the 
challenge LESS. The players who have the competance to raid a Luclin 
boss in summoned mage armour are awarded the most powerful weapons in 
the game... the players who would fail that raid even in the best gear 
available are relegated to wearing the weakest gear.

In golf we handicap the strongest players... in EQ we handicap the 
weakest.

Kind of funny almost.

I'm not saying its wrong, given how EQ is supposed to model a 'real 
world' its perfectly realistic, but as a "game for fun" its an ass-
backwards way of doing things. And it certainly screws up the game 
"balance"... when the best players are amplified and the worst are 
handicapped.

:)
