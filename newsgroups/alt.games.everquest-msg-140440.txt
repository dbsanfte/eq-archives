Sorry, son... You are talking about 2 different "offers"...

One offer is to meet up in real life and settle the differences like
men...

The OTHER offer is to debate this (or any other issue) in realtime in
IRC...

Strange thing is.... you and drmorris have chickened out of BOTH
offers...

I can understand you being a chicken shit to face me in real life..

But why so afraid to debate in IRC??  Are you so unsure of yourself
and your position, that you don't think it could stand up to a
realtime discussion???
