Yup, along with zoning with a pet up this improved pets quite a bit.

I don't think /pet get lost has a range limitation.  I've used it at quite a
distance, but maybe I'm just confused.  It's also a lot less necessary to
quickly kill a pet (exception: I somehow always manage to blow my first charm
attempt because I forget I have an animation!).  They don't aggro by
themselves anymore, so the "where's my pet?  incoming firehose of mobs!"
effect doesn't happen.

It's really handy when travelling not to have to resummon when you get there. 
And if you have the suspend AA, you can travel with one pocketed and one live.

Pretty much like going invis after nuking.  Any mob aggro on you (which
includes mobs aggro on your pet) can see you, invis or not.  It'll still work
on mobs far enough away from the fight not to pick up the aggro.

Umm, yeah.  It's not a "make phat xp while AFK" change.  It's a convenience
for travel.

Invis still breaks charm.  It just doesn't poof a summoned pet.
