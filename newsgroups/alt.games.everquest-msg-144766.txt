Waco was one small compound that was unlawfully attacked by an overpowering
government force.  What if that happened on a larger scale, with many more
Wacos?  The challenge isn't taking them out one at a time, the challenge is
having to fight them all at once.  I think things would start to look less
like Waco or Ruby Ridge, and more like the Revolution.

True, but the idea of a small militia in Lexington and Concord setting off a
fire that changes a nation isn't a fantasy.
