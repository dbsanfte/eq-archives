My experience in that regard is different.  I root the adds when we don't
have a mezzer available.  Once one mob goes down, the melee switch to one of
the rooted ones.  Root generally holds for a lot longer than a second or two
after they start beating on it.  This is in PoN, PoD, and PoI in particular.
When I used to solo in places other than PoP, I used root and my pet to kill
mobs.  My pet constantly meleeing, and me tossing DoTs that have a DD
component on the mobs.  Sure, root broke at times, but generally, lasted
plenty long enough to be worth using.  In PoP zones, I don't use my pet, but
I still use DoTs with a DD component.  Sometimes they break root, sometimes
not.
