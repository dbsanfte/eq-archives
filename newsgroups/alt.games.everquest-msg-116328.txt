OK, level 59 has two spells, count em, two.

One, the very fine celestial elixer....

and the second, the Unspoken Word.

Point Blank AOE, that does -less- damage than a lower level
PBAOE I already have, and has a Stun (which reportedly
is almost always resisted) and a blind component.

The cast time is very short, one second, and I was actually thinking
it might be useful while partnered with my druid buddy, I've done
a little PBAOE by standing in her kite path and timing things
carefully...
but blind half her little cluster of mobs so they run off and she loses
the cluster?  So much for that!

The recycle time is also extremely long, as is normal with stuns, this
means I can't stand and pound out multiple quick AOE bursts with it.

So.... what on Norrath is this spell good for, anything?
