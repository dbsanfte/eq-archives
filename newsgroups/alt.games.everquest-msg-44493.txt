You can find various pieces for sale at East Commonlands usually, but full 
suits don't usually go up, and this is in large part due to the pieces 
(except for the bracers, of course) being Lore.  The prices I know of for 
sure are 600pp to 700pp for the breastplate, and 125pp for each bracer; the 
other pieces range somewhere between those two prices.

Crafted is really quite decent, and Warriors often don't replace it until 
they're getting their planes gear, which can take well into the 50s.  
Crustacean Shell armor and Ry'Gorr armor tend to cost more, but neither is 
as good as Crafted for Warriors in my opinion.

atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
