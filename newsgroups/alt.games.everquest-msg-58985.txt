A druid not casting?????
It may be childish, but I prefer casting to melee, if only for the nice visual
effects. :-)

But yes, a group leader (and especially at the higher levels) should tell. At
least I tell everybody what to do (even if I am not the leader and I see the
healer joining in combat (and getting injured).

I hope you remember the name of the druid, because you should put her in the /no
friends list.
