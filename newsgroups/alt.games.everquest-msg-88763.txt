These dropped for about 2 days a few weeks ago from new undead pirates in
TD.  They were positioned on the NW rocks on Ogre Isle.  They also dropped
an EB necklace and a haste sash.  After an emergency patch, the mobs were
removed.  Fortunately I got the Sharkfin Boots for my monk about 8 hours
before the patch as they are better than Wu's slippers.  As far as I can
tell they aren't nerfed.  They add 6% to swimming and I certainly swim
faster than others with equal skill.
