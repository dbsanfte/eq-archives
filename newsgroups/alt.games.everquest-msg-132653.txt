Tried the 4 in 1's no help, tried deleting the eqclient.ini (though, 
since this machine had never been online, I had the default eqclient.ini 
anyway, worth a shot though since its been 3 weeks already :-(  )

Any other ideas? Please? I'd really hate to have to quit EQ over 
something so stupid.

Also, I emailed EQ tech support, no reply yet. If by some act of 
Innoruuk I get this computer on EQ, I will let everyone know what I did 
so that if anyone sees someone else with a similar problem we knwo what 
to try first, since this problem is extremely upsetting.

Thank you all again.
