Ya, I found it weird too.  Actually have a bad sinus cold and can't sleep so
thought I would log on to EQ to pass some time til my wife wakes up only to
find it down (the game that is, not my wife).  Ended up doing laundry at
4:00 A.M. on Christmas morning.  Ah yes - a holiday to remember!  Grrrrr.

To be honest, I would have thought that they would have taken a break from
the patches - at least until later in the week (27th or so??) unless they
have some major updates to do that they wanted to get in ASAP (doubt it
though).  Being in the Mountain time zone, things are supposed to be up and
running by 8:00 A.M. my time so not a big deal but if I was on the East
coast or in Europe and was a person hoping to log in and try the new
expansion that was left under the tree (or the new soundcard, or the new
computer, etc etc), I might be a tad frustrated.  Given how everyone and
their dog is home on Xmas and Boxing Day, would have thought they would have
waited unless, like I said, this is urgent (but again not likely)

Of course, my problem is I really only play EQ these days given how little
free time I have so nothing else really on my PC that is relatively new....
hmmm, anyone up for a game of Jedi Knight :)
