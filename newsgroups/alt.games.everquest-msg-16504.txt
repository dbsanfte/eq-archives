    Aye, I said that.  A cleric would be considered an "external fearer".
The reason I built it that way is because a necro gets both so you don't
need seperate peeps doing it.  Just him.  So replace 2 classes with one.

    Shaman regen can do that, though.

    Damage should never occur to the fearer/snarer, though.  If fear wears
off and beast still has fight in him, i'd only give it a 10% chance that it
would charge the caster with 3 rogues and a bard going at it.  If that 10%
is true, heck, let it charge!  Necro is sowed from shaman and can run
backwards letting rogues turn it into sushi.

    Re: level-based, you have a good point in context of tracking.  Ranger
could be in a very low level group whereas bards don't get track till much
later.  As for the original group, though, this can be done at level EIGHT
(if I'm not mistaken).  By level 8, necros can blind, fear and has their
first mana-generation spell, shaman has sow and would just heal instead of
regen and rogues get backstab by then (again, if i'm not mistaken).  If not
8 then I know it's 12.  A level 8 group kiting crocs in oasis, though (and
it only gets better) is amazing...
