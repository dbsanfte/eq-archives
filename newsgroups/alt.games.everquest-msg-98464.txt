Invis only works on people you're grouped with.  It
was changed to this early in release, because griefers
used it on mages and necros while they were fighting
to get them killed.  (Actually, IIRC, it was changed
right after the change that made pets poof when the
caster went invis.  That was related to an exploit.)
