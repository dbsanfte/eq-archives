Sorry, no.

It would only "disprove" the "top plus one theory" if people were claiming
that taunt had a 100% success rate.  It does not.  You obviously cannot walk
up to a mob that someone has been fighting for 5 or 10 minutes, taunt once,
and get it to switch to you.   The amount of hate needed to be overcome to
get the mob switched is fed into a skill roll.  The more of a lead the other
person has, the harder the roll.   Even with 230 taunt skill, it's not hard
to reach the level where taunt has a .000001% chance of success, if not
absolutely zero.

If you want this kind of proof, I've already offered it the last time this
subject came up.   The AA skill AE taunt *is* 100% success.  The mob *will*
(not counting low health aggro) immediately switch to you, even if it has
been fighting someone for 20 minutes.    But if that person continues
fighting, or casts a few spells, he can *easily* pull it back off you.

Obviously AE taunt *does* move you to just slightly ahead of the top person
on the hate list.

When asked to explain to me why AE taunt would be coded in a completely
different manner than the taunt skill, the "taunt adds hate" people were
conspicuously silent.

No, it's pointless because for any set of outcomes you can interpret it in
both ways.


For instance, paladin starts stunning, the warrior walks up and taunts the
mob.  The mob turns to the warrior.   The "taunt plus one" people would say
that the warrior succeeded on his taunt roll, and that's why it turned to
him.   The "taunt adds hate" people would say that the paladin hadn't built
up enough aggro.

If you had the paladin stun for a full minute or two before the warrior did
his first (and only?) taunt, and the mob did not switch to the warrior, the
"taunt plus one" people would say the hate lead by the paladin was simply
too great for the warrior's taunt skill to have more than a one in a million
(if that) chance of succeeding.  The "taunt adds hate" people would say
"see, it adds a set amount, and not enough to overcome the stunning."

If it doesn't turn the first time, the warrior continues taunting, the
paladin continues stunning.  At that point, if it did turn to the warrior,
the "taunt plus one" people would say he finally succeeded his taunt roll.
The "taunt adds hate" people would say he finally taunted enough times to
build up sufficient hate to get it to switch.

Once again, how exactly do you think this experiment will prove anything?
