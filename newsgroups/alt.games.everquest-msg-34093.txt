Necromancers aren't liked in groups and I personally cant understand it. I
mean we can nuke, DoT, Root, Snare, mez, have tough ass pets, transfer mana,
make mana faster than other classes and people dont like that for some
reason!

We're like Necrodruichantwarriors! Yet nobody likes us in groups *shrugs*
