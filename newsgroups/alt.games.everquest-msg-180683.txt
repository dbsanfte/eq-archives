As a player your "evaluation" means nothing. I am not the one claiming
knowledge of Sony's testing procedures (or lack there of) based solely
on my personal experiences playing the game. Who is the arrogant
prick?

They test adaquately enough to keep 400k+ playing. They obviously do
not test adaquately enough to keep people like you from ranting and
whining. Yet you still play...Who is the jackass? If enough people
like you quit playing, then Sony would have to improve their QA if
they wanted to keep EQ proffitable.

No, I am merely trying to persuade you to use logic and accept the
fact that your "beliefs" and "opinions" represent only 1 player out of
400k+. Obviously my attempts are in vain. Sadly you seem to think that
your opinion is right and the only one worth entertaining. You further
seem to harbor an intense dislike for the way EQ is run. Why do you
keep playing, if the state of the game is so bad in your opinion?

Add up all of the positive changes made to EQ, and all the "up time"
of the service over the last 4+ years. Now subtract the negatives like
downtime lost to bugs, patches, and emergency patches. The final total
will be overwhelmingly positive. If you still believe that they don't
care, or that they don't test, then no amount of reason or logic will
convince you otherwise.

>use their paid testers or their paid testers are grossly incompetent.
>Take your pick.

You missed one. You are grossly ignorant.  

When dealing with software programs bugs slips through the cracks. It
has nothing to do with the number of testers or their competency. The
larger and more complex the program the harder it is to nail all the
bugs. Especially when you have to make changes incrementally on a live
product. If Sony hired 10,000 more paid testers, we would still see
bugs on patch day.

Your total lack of knowledge with regards to software development and
testing, and your refusal to apply logic to the situation prevent you
from seeing the mistakes in your conclusions. EQ continues to push the
envelope with additional content through expansions and scheduled
patches. They have done an amazing job keeping the product stable when
you consider the staggering number of changes over the last 4+ years.

Read carefully now......THEY DO NOT HAVE TO "AFFORD" MORE TESTING AS
LONG AS THE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO PLAY/PAY. It really is that simple. It
doesn't matter whether or not you (or I) are satisfied with their
testing. As long as you pay/play you are telling Sony that the quality
of the testing is good enough. Speak with your wallet. It is the only
voice that will matter to Sony (or any other company that produces a
consumer product). 

>Ha so when something is the market leader its automatically doing the
>best it can!  What a revelation!  You are a fucking genius.

I never claimed they are doing the best they can. I stated they are
doing the best they can with the resources they currently have
allocated. There is a difference. You erroneously claim that they
don't care and that they do not test the changes they make. That is a
completely different argument than whether or not they are "doing the
best they can". What you fail to grasp is that as long as the game is
succesful there is no reason or incentive to change the situation. EQs
leadership in the market merely reinforces this fact.

Neither you nor I are in a position to determine whether or not they
are doing the best they can, or if it is cost effective to allocate
more resources to testing and debugging. What we can see, applying
logic and reason, is that the success of EQ indicates that the
resources they do allocate are "good enough". If you continue to play
EQ, then you obviously are willing to accept "good enough" just like
the rest of us (400k+).

Trust me it doesn't take a genius to refute and destroy your
arguments.
