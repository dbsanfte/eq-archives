Even taking your examples into account, while I can see some situations
where it *could* be possible, I don't think "*most* players" is a fair
statement. I wouldn't even call it common, at least from my experience.
We raid deep into the Hole regularly, as well as DN, Arena in Kael,
Howling Stones, etc.  I can't recall a time where we've ever set up an
expedition really far into one of those dungeons without *at least* one
druid and/or wizard. When the objetive is done, you evac/port/TL out. 
Fighting your way out through the same no-benefit real estate you
already paid for to get to the target is just a waste of time, IMO.  I'm
sure that VP, and maybe ToV North and such it might be different, but
again, you're hardly talking about "most players" there either.

I mean, I guess if you're in a really small guild and you just don't
know any porters, I suppose it's possible, but Jeez Louise! Druids are
about as common as fruit flies. Your guild should certainly be able to
pick up a few easily enough if you start recruiting.

Naw, I'm with the previous poster. The only time I can think of when we
couldn't end an excercise in fairly short order when the critical mass
of players or the leader wanted to call it a day is in the extremely
rare case of taking a TPW *just* as you are getting ready to quit. Then,
yes, I'll admit it will take an extra while to mop up the damage. Even
then, though, if you're at all experienced in raiding and the inevitable
CR's, you can do it fairly quickly. We took a wipeout in Hate last week
of almost an entire 36 person force, and were pulling again in less than
fifteen minutes. 

I'd hardly call the scenario in question common for most players.
