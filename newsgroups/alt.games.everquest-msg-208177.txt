The phrase "need before greed" is equally devoid of any meaning.  I don't do
"NBG".  Ever.  In my experience, "desire before want" is *much* more
indicative of what actually occurs when people use "need before greed".

And considering the "gameliness" of this game, I don't see that anything can
qualify as being "needed" (other than a monthly payment to Sony).  You want
a high quality cougar skin.  A high quality cougar skin is required to
complete...  whatever.  But in no way do you *need* a high quality cougar
skin.  Perhaps you'd like to expound on why a high quality cougar skin is
*necessary* in your life?

Yeah, people use need with a lighter connotation, because it is easier than
the more grammatically correct suchandsuch is "required for" blahblah.  I
use greed with a lighter connotation to match.
