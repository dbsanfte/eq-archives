Oh hush, druid tracking was upgraded from 50 to 125 when you got the
sorting ability. We got the added range, but it's only good for
looking for nameds - and I wouldn't really want it any other way.
(Heck, it was better for random pulling at skill 50, when you knew
things weren't too far away ;) )
Our similarities with rangers include tracking skill; druids through
forest lore and bards presumably through sounds. If you have a problem
with that, I'd like my sow and wolf form back, please.

Oh, and make people stop asking me for kitty feet and calls, too.
