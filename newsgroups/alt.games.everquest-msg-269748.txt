oh, 2 years ago, I was 'cool but comfortable' around 75 degrees.

For the last year and some months, I've been working in an office that 
regulary dips below 65 F. (This in an effort to keep the server room 
below 80. I'd work in the server room but it would destroy my hearing.

Now I turn the heat down at home when it hits 73 or so, as it's getting 
too warm.

That acclimation might have come in handy a few years ago during a The 
December Ice Storm (If you live in middle TN you know when I was talking 
about) when I spent christmas morning nursing an overloaded generator 
all morning.
