I think another member would be best, an Enchanter would be great as he can
levitate you so that the icy floor poses no problems and can mez the
overpulls. If no enchanter then a druid, shammy or wizard even for the
levitate and root parking. Exp is very good in ToFS.

I would also recommend the Genoids in Crystal Caverns, they hit hard and
fast but my oh my is the exp good from them. They also drop rubies sometimes
so you can make some nice platinum. You will lose faction with them but is
only important to casters after the focus quest which neither you nor the
cleric need. Whilst in CC you could go fight orcs, not much in the way of
exp for you Jazz but your cleric will level quickly to 37 and all the drops
can be banked at the dorf town down there.

The Kodiak caves also offer good hunting and exp but not much in the way of
loot, but Icetooth claws sell well for couple hundred plat.
