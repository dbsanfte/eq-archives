There are various factors that will determine which will be better for YOU.  
How close you are to your phone switch will have an impact on  how fast DSL 
is and how many people are on your loop will have an impact on your cable 
modem service.

Where I live, I'm too far to make DSL worth it and the phone company here 
sucks nuts, so I wouldn't use them unless cable wasn't provided, even if my 
cable speeds were half what they are.

See if you can get a freen installation and some sort of guarantee if you 
don't like it and try one of them and see what you think.  If you have a 
close neighbor that has one of them, see what their service is like.
