I just have to interject here.  While haste is a short duration spell, come
on...  Some of those fast moving, frenzy mobs are throwing in a lot of hits
at once.  Haste for Melee allows them to keep up with those mobs who do get
a boost in their attack speed.  I have seen some mobs get haste before you
get a chance to whack at them.  If you really don't think it is much of a
benefit, then I guess a lot of tanks are wasting their time getting low
delay weapons, we should all go for those 40 to 50 delay weapons with the
uber damage, and hope we hit hard while them mobs go whacking away.
