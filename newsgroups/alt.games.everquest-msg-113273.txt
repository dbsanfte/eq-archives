Its a "don't put them on the spot" thing. People don't like that.
Here, I will give you a compareble exercise:

Go into the lobby of some very ritzy hotel where everyone is obviously
rich and money means nothing to them. Start walking up to people who
look rich and asking them to borrow a quarter; I bet a lot ignore
you.. See how long it is before you are no longer in that hotel.

The thing to do was to ask for sow in the proper channels, as in:

/ooc I am at the entrance of the EC tunnel looking for an sow, someday
I will return the favor and give you a breeze or a clarity.

Waiting for you to understand that it won't work that way (with your
enchanter) You'd not have the time or the mana for all the requests
you got, unless all you did was stand there and breeze people and not
play yourself.
