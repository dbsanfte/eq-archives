   He already knows it.  Besides, I can't kick his "kick his stoopid Ogre ass" with
any degree of success.  All  I can do is stand by, and let him die when something big
and bad is pounding on him.  He knows this too, and somehow, it is enough.
  Oh, as a postscript for the real-life aspect of this whole nightmare..., he woke up
an hour after he passed out, and spent the next three hours in the bathroom, with his
head in the throne.  I'd like to say that I was mature enough not to smirk at him. 
Yep, that would be nice, if I could.

Annie <--- Drinks too, of course, but with much less annoying results.
