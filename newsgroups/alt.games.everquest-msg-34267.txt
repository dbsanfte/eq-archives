"the programmers" clearly indicates the Everquest programmers, which
you have since claimed was your entire intent. The phrase "my
experiences with programmers", however, clearly indicates a much
larger set of programmers. You seem to be ignoring this part, perhaps
in the hopes that it will just go away.

As for being too sensitive, my entire reaction was:

>Don't paint all programmers with that brush.

Which is hardly evidence of having been reduced to tears by your
cutting jibe.

Yes, if I didn't expand or qualify the statement, it would reasonably
be understood that the discussion was targeted at the tobacco company
chemists. However, if I then added the phrase "This is pretty
consistent with my experiences with chemists", well, that there
expands the statement rather dramatically.

>Beyond explaining my position to you

You've explained it several times, quite clearly, but each explanation
has avoided touching on the "consistant with my experiences" phrase.
I'm not arguing with you over you opinion of Everquest programmers
(though I could, as the things you are attributing to them are from
the content developers, not the programmers), I'm taking exception to
your generalization.

>I feel no obligation to modify my posting style.

I'm not asking you to, nor would I want you to. This newsgroup would
hardly be interesting if everyone felt and posted exactly as I do,
after all.
