    Like the head of the GM program is going to fire someone on the say-so
of a bunch of people in a "little raid party". DT, I have a nice screenshot
on my computer of a GM killing someone in a *duel*, complete with the
victory message, in the middle of the Field of Bone newbie zone. Isn't that
also an offense? The GM sure didn't seem to care. Would you care to guess
what would have happened to me if I'd /reported and /petitioned that, and
the duelling GM had been the one to get the petition?

    Or the person in question may have pissed off the GM with something they
said outside of guildchat, which Meem didn't notice/relay to us. I've seen
people who thought they were being civil sass off GMs big-time and not even
realize it.

    This is where I have a question for you, Meem. Had you aggroed Tunare
while pulling? There IS a known bug where, if she de-aggros, she poofs
rather than warping back into the tree like she should. It's rare, but it
does happen - it happened to us once.

> Bug or normal feature. Tunare isn't exactly a frequently-hunted spawn

    Tunare dies within two days of server-up on every server except perhaps
Test, FV, and the Zeks. She is quite hunted. There's a nice thread on The
Safehouse about how contested various servers are - it makes for interesting
reading. I'd hate to be on the Tunare server after reading it....

    They wouldn't have started clearing if she hadn't been up. With the new
24 hour randomizer, it's not worth it to try and anticipate something
spawning. I also note they mentioned "Where's Tunare," indicating to me they
had seen her on track before and now she was missing. I have listed a way in
which she could despawn, but trust me - they would know if they had aggroed
Tunare. She issues a zone-wide shout and summons almost all the mobs in the
zone to where she is - that's tough to miss. If the PoGs had also been up at
the time, the net effect would have been a train to the raid party
consisting of almost every mob left alive in the Plane of Growth.

    Again, they would have seen the zone-wide shout and noticed when all the
mobs warped away from them and on top of the foolish KS team. Ail can
damn-near wipe a lot of Tunare raids - dealing with Ail and Tunare at once
(Meem did say Ail was still up, so he would have joined in the fun) would be
damn-near impossible.

    They don't have to be important. GM gets angry at something said, GM
exacts revenge. GM then uses the exact same excuses YOU just used to justify
why Tunare is missing, even though they're BS. I agree that it must have
been something biting to get a GM to do something like that, but I can see
it happening and a GM is human.
