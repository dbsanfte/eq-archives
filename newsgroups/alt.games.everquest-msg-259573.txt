I'm pretty sure I fell for the tree trap in BB.  (Not sure why I even
stepped in there, but hey...)  I think I had Feign Death by then, so
I wasn't too bothered, but it did take me a while to find my way out.

The most unexpected pit for me, though, was when I was a youngster
(pre-level 10, thank heavens) and managed to find my way across the
Field of Bone to Kaesora.  I had no idea what it was about (dungeon?
another PC city?), so I headed down the zone-in ramp, walked forward
a little ways, fell down a pit, and got mugged by some large number
of spiders.

I must've been an impressionable lad, because after that it took me
nigh on forever before I was willing to explore some of the other
ramps to underground sections in Field of Bone.  The spiderlings and
such down there were long green to me by the time I discovered them.
