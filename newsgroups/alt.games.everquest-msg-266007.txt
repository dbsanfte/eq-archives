Actually, all but the "Live!Drive" would be fine on the Antec Sonata.  The
front USB/Firewire/Mic/Headphone jacks are not behind the door that covers
the drive bays, but rather behind the silver cylindrical thing that looks
decorative below that.  That rolls back to reveal those ports.

Yeah, but that does include a good power supply.  I shudder to think of what
might be included with a $9 case.  And $90 is cheap compared to what you can
spend on a case...look at some of the Lian-Li cases, for example, and then
$90 will seem cheap. :-)
