Hi Ya Tina!  Nice to see another woman playing the game.  LOIO is a good
place to hunt, then I'd suggest as you reach 30 to go back to Antonica to
either Cazic Thule or to Upper/Lower (maybe) Guk.  If you haven't already
keep all your skills maxed out, that includes the bash weapons.  Though I
haven't really seen a warrior piercing I would suggest that you give that
some practice too.  As a warrior you should be able to switch to whatever
weapon you feel would do the most damage to keep the critter busy and keep
its attention off the casting crew.  Unfortunately we warriors don't get
pets, or any type of magic.  Thats the point of being a "meat shield".  We
depend entirely on the group that we are with and they depend on us to do
our jobs.  A cleric can be your best friend :)

At 23 your probably bronze, with a little other stuff thrown in? Start
saving your plats, or questing for the pieces of Crafted soon.  That will
hold you until you can get better.  As for a weapon the 2hs I'd look at a
Mith 2h or an Executioners Axe.  I know a bit overdone, but worth the time,
or the cash.  Been seeing the exe axe going for 300pp on Brell.  1hs a SSOY
is good, or the new Icetooths Claw.  Both have good damage, but you have to
wait until 37 for the SSOY to proc its special.  The claw doesn't proc, but
its 11dam 29del.  So quick and deadly :)

Take a look at www.everquest.allakhazam.com
                        www.maximumeq.com
                        www.eqprices.com
all are great sites for info and prices on stuff.  Each has links to other
sites that offer more info also.  Good luck.
