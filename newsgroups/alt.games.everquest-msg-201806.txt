From talking to people, it seems like from when the time the Elementals were
first breeched and farmed, up until now, they have really shut off the loot
firehose.  I know that many of the mini bosses are now much harder, and that
some of their drops became much more rare.  I also have heard that at least
one god, Xegony, is now a lot harder than she was initially.  Not
surprising, SOE has done it before, but shitty nonetheless, at least for
those who didnt ride the gravy train early.

PoP has really screwed our guild's DKP economy as well.  Only VT trips
really encourage people to spend big points, but we give out big points for
flagging runs to encourage people to come so that stragglers can get
backflagged.  So tons of people end up with tons of points, and most of
those people (myself included) have little use for anything outside of VT
and ToSR.

We are working RZ and ToSR atm.  We still do VT, but it seems like a lot of
the guild wants to move past it once RZ is beaten.  I am not of that mind, I
love the place.  Heh and reading your message, I am pretty sure we are both
on Tribunal.
