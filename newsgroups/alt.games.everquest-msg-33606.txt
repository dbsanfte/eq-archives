Nay, I've noticed taht my EQ client continues running just as  if it were
still maximized.  ie, when I type in a url or use the arrow keys on my
desktop, EQ also responds to it.  When I switched back into eq, everyone who
was sitting next to me knew that I had gone to visit pricewatch, wwf online,
and trekkie.org
