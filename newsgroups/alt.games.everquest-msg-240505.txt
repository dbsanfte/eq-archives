Yeah, but it wasn't that easy for me to find.  This one
http://www.ralloszek.net/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?Cat=0 doesn't seem to be that
active, or else it is heavily moderated, which wouldn't surprise me really. 
Then there are the ign server board at
http://vnboards.ign.com/Rallos_Zek_(PvP)_Board/b5023/ but this isn't really a
stand alone forum.  I would guess it doesn't get much activity at all.

   For the definitive "How to join AGE chat" just refer to my very informative
sig below.

   To the original poster, another thing you might want to do is look into
joining a guild.  You can try by looking at http://www.guildmagic.com/index.cfm
though this site is fairly buggy.  You can also try to find one on the community
forums I listed, or failing that, just /ooc'ing in the PoK.  

Good luck!
