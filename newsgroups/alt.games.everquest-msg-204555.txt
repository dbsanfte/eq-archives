Possibly, I've seen people buy at one place, and then scan around the next
few traders - usually for acrylia, say, tradeskills supplies - its just as
quick to look at the nearest traders than find the next cheapest and move
to them. Also some go get the item on hold to check its there and then ask
guildmates if its worht buying - or they have asked and someone says
'NOOO!'

Some people dont wade through the bazaar system (strange as it may seem)
and also with so many traders there is the mishit option as well
