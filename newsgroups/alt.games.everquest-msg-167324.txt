Ok... let me be more spcific about the problem with Beastlords in PvP
combat.  My pet can attack the player all he likes, but the moment I die, my
pet goes away.  So all the player has to do is kill me (and I'm not all that
hard to kill) and he's won the fight.  The great advantage to having a pet
is that I can stand back and let him fight and keep my hp up, while I heal
him.  Don't get me wrong... I don't die easily... but I should be able to
take players at my own level, and I can't.  Maybe I'm playing the class
wrong.  Maybe my gear isn't good enough, I know it's really not very good.
Oh well.  I'm going to make some money I think, then I'll go buy myself some
better gear and try the PvP game some more.

What are you talking about, since I started I can't imagine playing anywhere
else.
