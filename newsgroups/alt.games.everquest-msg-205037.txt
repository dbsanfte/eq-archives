    No, dark blue by two levels the other way. As in, had they been two
levels lower they'd have been light blue.

    The slaves? Yeah, it was silly in the first place that they were higher

    AD&D isn't so bad because a GM can tailor challenge, and reward, to the
capabilities of the party. I think the biggest example of this was the game
set that had high level characters fighting kobolds, kobolds that were more
than capable of wiping an unprepared group.
