I respectfully disagree. A game has been defined as "a series of 
interesting decisions", and the new leadership XP makes choosing a group 
leader from something entirely irrelevant into one of those interesting 
decisions. There will be strife, of course, but it will certainly be 
both interesting and entertaining to see how that strife solves itself.

I see personal reputation acquiring a lot more importance now, and 
that's a good thing.
