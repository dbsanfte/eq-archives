Wrong. There was almost NOTHING at the time like it. At least, not on
that scale. Yeah, MUDs kept info server-side, but the info was a hell
of a lot simpler, and they didn't have anything that even held a
candle to the numbers that BNet dealt with even in D1's early days.
They simply didn't have the infrastructure or resources to deal with
hosting everything server side.

Internet gaming was VERY new as a large scale commercial endeavor at
the time. Games designed specifically for internet play were unheard
of. For Diablo, dial-up connect games, LAN games, and such were
anticipated to be as much, if not more, common as BNet games. Another
part of storing characters client-side was to allow the same
characters to be used either way. Storing them server-side wouldn't
allow that.
