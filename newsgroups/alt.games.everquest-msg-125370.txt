Bard/Ranger works real nice too.

Another poster mention bard/monk which is a similar pair.  A ranger can deal out some pretty
insane damage, and take a bit of pounding too.  Plus they also have some decent buffs (not nearly
as good as a druid or shaman, but decent).  AND they have harmony which is really a great outdoor
single pull spell.  Better than a monk pull, IMO, because you take absolutely no damage in the separating
of the mobs.  Outdoors, with the ranger's harmony and snare, and the bard's haste, and slow and fear,
you make a great team.

Indoors, this pair doesn't work as well because no harmony, and fear is very dangerous.  So charm
comes in handy, as does the ton of buffs that a bard can sing.

During downtime, the bard can pump the ranger's mana  back up pretty fast using a 3 song twist.
And the ranger can heal using the mana the bard is providing,  in addition to the bard's regen.

My wife and I have played this pair to level 44 each so far.

Have fun!
