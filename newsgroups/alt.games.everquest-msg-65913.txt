I was playing my dwarf cleric, and a friend zoned in and came down into
the crater to see me, putting wolf form up as she normally does.  Looked
like a beautifully rendered white/silver wolf.  I logged out to my Kitten,
and she looked like the tiniest chihuahua I've ever seen, I know Vah Shir
are tall, but this was beyond silly; the passing beetles were towering over
her, Rockhoppers looked like Godzilla compared to her.  She was also
dark in coloration... despite not having changed forms.

I believe this supports my contention that the bug is centered around
people who log in after the illusion is applied... but she's a woodie,
so so much for my halfling hypothesis... and she's smaller than a halfling
anyway.

As an aside, Vah Shir are -huge-!  Another friend showed up as
his dwarf, who looked perfectly normal in height to my dwarf... and
when I swapped in the kitten again, I was -towering- over him,
looked like more so than from the perspective of the barbarian I
deleted to create the kitten.

I'd expected Vah Shir to be about wood elf sized, the thought of a
shaman race that wasn't outlandishly large actually seemed like
a fun idea.  Nope, somehow Shaman = Giant in someone's mind...
