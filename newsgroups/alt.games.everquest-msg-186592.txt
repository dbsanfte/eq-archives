Umm, no. What you refer to here is only half of the issue. Take for
instance an experience my beastlord had in the Gunthak caverns the
other day: 

See me pull a drogmore. See me send my (parked) pet out. See pet run
the other way, up a wall. See pet warp to parts unknown. See drogmore
proceed to beat the snot out of me. See me hightailing it to the
beach, shouting 'Train to beach! Move it or lose it!!'. See poor
wizard get mowed down by drogmore and various other stuff that aggros
on the way back.

At least I'm a melee and have decent AC. A mage gets torn through like
wet tissue paper, if they can't manage to channel gate.
