I think it rocks.

I have many friends who play on different servers.. theres no chance I'll
move to them, and no chance they will move to me.. and it gives us the
chance to at least say hi to each other.

Or friends I've met on this NG, its nice to be able to say hi to people.   A
list of servers and their names in the command would be nice though... why
can't everyone be short and simple like "prexus"

";tell prexus.meemers hi fgt"
