While I've never done this, I believe the classic Sol Ro faction quest would
be Derv Cutthroat rings to the orc in South Ro.  I've heard several
paladins (who apparantly are the only class which needs SolRo faction
higher than its default) doing this quest repeatedly.

While it would be possible
to farm those rings yourself, I'd suggest making a quest of it, offering rewards

to people who bring you 8 rings, that sort of thing, good way to dispose
of your half decent but not worth auctioning loot, and reward the newbie
population who get exp from the derv camps.

Another approach is to PL a friends alt off the camp, or heck, play one
of your own alts that gets exp there.

Or you can just go in when the server isn't crowded, nuke each derv camp
with a PBAOE and let your pet clean up the mess...
