Ah, that's why I specified "the front part of the city."  As you go in
deeper you start running into different mobs with other loot tables. The
Goos can drop things that won't pop off the front area mobs, and deep on
in are Dark Reavers and such, 50+ mobs, that drop even more stuff, as
well as items required for the Ranger epic, among others. I agree that
you wouldn't want to homogenously randomize the *entire* dungeon, but
randomizing sections of it that way cuts down on camping and gives more
groups a fair shot at any given item/loot table.
