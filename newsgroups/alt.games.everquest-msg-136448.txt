    There's another bug - if you use items with charges that are expendable,
and have something else on your cursor when you expend the item, you risk
losing what is on your cursor. Guildmate lost her JBoots when modding that
way. We also had people losing random items all day, including some lucid
shards that had taken them forever to camp.
