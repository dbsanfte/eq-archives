Here is the situation.  I have a Vah Shir Rogue that looks naked to me on
the log in screen and in game even though he is fully "dressed" the only
things I can see are his weapons and helm.  I have asked people in game and
they can see all my armor fine.  Now, I also have a Vah Shir BST that looks
fine on the log in screen and in game and the rest of my charters look fine.
I do have the game installed on 2 other computers around the house and they
all have the same issues with this charter.   The video cards and memory
amounts are different on the other computers so the graphics are turned down
a bit but still the same root issue with my rogue.  This issue seems to have
started the other night when the server crashed but I'm not 100% sure.
Has anyone else had this problem? and/or any ideas how to fix it?  I have
tried to contact VI support but we all know how that is.
