People expect ports and buffs because they *get* ports and buffs.
Nobody wants to be bothered for them, but as your post made abundantly
clear, enough people give in to the nagging that it's worth a beggar's

If you don't want to deal with beggars, stop giving them what the ask
for and encourage others to do the same. Currently, you're part of the
problem.
