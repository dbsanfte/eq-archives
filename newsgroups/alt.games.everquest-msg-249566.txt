}Somehow this doesn't add up, but I can't figure out where.

Naw, that's about right.  Just gotta factor in that 40% want both, 20% 
want one thing one week and the other the next week, 20% want help with 
their epic or flagging, 20% want everyone to go away so they can 
tradeskill or grind LDoN's, Dreadnok thinks we should be pure RP only...

The most noise is made by the 10% that vey specifically want a pure raid 
guild or pure family style, though. :)

By the way, is that you, Kobes Mezzbreaker? :)
