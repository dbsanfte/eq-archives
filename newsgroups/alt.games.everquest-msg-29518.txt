This turned out about three times longer than intended,
so apologies in advance for the length.

I'd have to take issue with this statement. If the Warrens has a
popularity problem, it's not caused by the loot rules. In fact, most
of the low-levels who use the zone don't even know about them. It's
"problem" is its location. Odus in general and Toxxulia in particular
are both a big pain in the butt to get to and navigate through. Any
non-Paineelian who visits has to be reasonably dedicated and
adventurous to try getting there in the first place.

If the Warrens was located in EC/WC (say, in the spot where
Befallen is now or maybe Orc 2 in EC), it would be full 24/7.

Let's face it: Most of the loot in the Warrens is there for flavor.
The burlap is just renamed cloth. The soft wicker is leather with
a unique look. The bamboo splint is not-quite banded. The Asian
weapons have crappy damage/delay ratios generally, but they
also have a unique look so a lowbie can wield a katana that isn't
much better than his friend's tarnished long sword but it looks
a whole lot cooler.

As for the "high-end" loot, most of it is of the same calibre.
Interesting at a level where you can acquire it but of little
interest to most players who are already above their low
20's except as twinking material.

To high-level players in general, (rather than Bizbee
in particular):

Given that no-one has seen Luclin, I'd say it's quite a bit
too early for all of the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt that
I keep hearing. Give the game designers a chance to show
their stuff before condemning them. In the meantime, vote
with your wallet. If you don't like the Trivial Loot Code then
don't buy the expansion.

Before I get labeled as a hardass, I'll add that I'm sympathetic
to the plight of the "highbies" in this situation. I suspect that the
thrill is not so much from getting "phat lewt" as it is from exploring
and experiencing ALL aspects of a new expansion. The truth is,
that you can still do that. It may seem galling that you can't pick up
that lowbie quest item or lore magic gizmo but truthfully: why
would you want to? There can't be a lot of satisfaction in waltzing
into a totally green lowbie dungeon and doing the equivalent of
turning in kobold molars. If you get that new piece of lowbie no-drop
gear, what are you going to do with it besides let it sit in your
bank account as a trophy? In short, are you really missing all that
much?

If there's a problem with this whole discussion it's that it's focussing
on what the highbies are NOT getting instead of on what they ARE
getting. A whole new area of high-level dungeons to raid. A new
god(s) to challenge. The Combine empire to battle or aid as you
see fit. From the broad hints that are being given, I picture this as
being a faction/story related area similar to Velious. Ways to buy
new skills using your 60+ experience bubbles. There's a balance
to be struck by the designers, and the whole "Why can't I farm
the lower levels just to experience them" argument ignores the
fact that there is high-level content in the area also.

Does a 55-60 level character really need to get into a level 20
and below dungeon? If you really want to experience such a dungeon,
why not do it the way it was meant to be experienced, with a
low-level character? Heck, get your guild to create a "Luclin-raid"
sister guild that is all low-level alts of your current guild and go
on raids together. If you actually get anything that your highbies
just have to have, then pass it back up to the parent guild.

As a final thought, I'll lay out the opinion that at least part of
the reason for the Trivial Loot Code is to try to stimulate the
economy from the bottom up. Highbies might actually want to
take some of their plat and pass it down to the midbies in
exchange for items they can't get, instead of the current situation
where the money and items almost always flow in the
opposite direction. Why would they do that instead of
"power camping" a second low-level character? For the same
reason they buy bone-chips and bat wings instead of looting
them: a lot of effort for minimal overall gain. Let's face it,
you can power-camp the King and Prince in the Warrens
right now. In all of the time I've spent there, I've seen it happen
exactly once. The loot just isn't so great  as to make it
worth the effort of doing it. I can't see Luclin diverging
substantially from that model.

However, there's one way to find out: Visit Stonebrunt
Mountains. As surely as the Warrens was an experiment to
test the viability of the Trivial Loot Code, Stonebrunt is a
preview of what it will be like to have an entire region
of zones that have the Trivial Loot Code enabled. Check it
out and use that experience to gauge how you would feel
about an expansion with 3/4 of the new zones behaving in
a similar manner.

In other words, make an informed decision and then
vote with your wallet. Don't make a decision based on
a lot of "what if's" and FUD.
