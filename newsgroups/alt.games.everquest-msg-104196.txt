A guildie of mine was bound in S Ro, and when he died he came to in S Ro and
there was the AC, with no one else in the zone.  Being a naked 55 Cleric, he
started killing the AC, died again to respawn in S Ro, and finished him off.
What luck.  It was fairly early in the morning EST IIRC, which was why there
was almost no one except a newbie or two there.
