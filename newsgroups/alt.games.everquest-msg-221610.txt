I took my mage from 39 to 40 on the beach in Gunthak yesterday,
easy as falling off a drogmar.  Never had one add, single pulled
with complete reliability despite an absolute lack of any pulling
or parking tools.  I pulled with Cancel magic, which is cheap,
has decent range, and is very low aggro, meaning it doesn't piss
off nearby mobs as much but more importantly its very easy for my
pet to pull the target off me when I get it back to camp.

I think Kiting could be trouble, but I find it hard to believe
you wouldn't be able to root/rot the undead on the water's edge
without adds.
