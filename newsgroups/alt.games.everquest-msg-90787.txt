    On our raids we usually have at least four warriors. This means we can
not only have an offtanker, but we can actually cycle /disc defensive and
always have two warriors ready with discipline up. That means the fights
that require offtanking go a lot more smoothly, which is good as those are
the fights where things can be screwed up the worst.

    Heh, warriors level up on raids? I thought warriors only lost levels on
raids? :-)

    Warriors are a very dependable source of damage. After monks, rogues,
and maybe rangers (don't see a lot of damage output differences here, to be
honest), they churn out the most. And if we get an "oops" pull (inc. A Centi
Dator, A Centi Dator, a few more, whoops hit the Mind Worm trap!) they're
the damage source that's least likely to evaporate.
