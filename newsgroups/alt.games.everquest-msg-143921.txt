Kinda fun to go back into the dungeons that were *scary* ..
.. and just walk around killin stuff..  for laffs.

*Especially* when you and your partner are the only ones there.

Right now my wife and a friend are down in SolA on our server,
..they are the only ones in the zone.. and they are havin a ball.
