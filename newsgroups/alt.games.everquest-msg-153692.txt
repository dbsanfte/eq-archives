I play an Ogre Shaman and thought it'd be cool to see if VI would make a
model for Ogres(and other large races) wearing the ALL/ALL robes.  Bare with
me, it'd be sort of along the lines of a mu-mu(sp?).  Of course it'd just be
for fun, cause I know of a sweet looking white robe that comes from the
VahShir city that has crappy stats.

Just bored at work, had an idea.
