I have levelled to 70 in EQ2 and 49.3 in VG.
I enjoyed both but I prefer VG over EQ2 even with the issues it has.

I like the non-instanced stuff.
I like being able to buff people out of group.
I love our guildhall ;)

Alot of people say there isn't any content at the end as raiding is not in
yet (within the next month).
There is still plenty to do, I think the majority of the claims are from
those who powered through the content and didn't enjoy it.

Crafting is fun, different from EQ2 in that you can get up to get a coffee
and come back to where you were.
You're given complications which hamper your progress and can be downright
annoying sometimes.

I really enjoy diplomacy too, the bunch of people in channel are really
helpful and you learn alot of lore from doing the quests and parleys.

I think to get the most out of the game you need to find a good bunch of
people to hang with or guild with.
It's worth reading the forums to make sure you pick a server you'll be happy
on and take it from there.

Don't forget the system requirements are minimum, and there are known issues
with some of the 8800gts cards I think it was, as well as Vista.

Still, a free month is a free month, give it a whirl!
