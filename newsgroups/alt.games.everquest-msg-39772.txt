I used to be that way. When i started the game I thought 'Im only going to have
one character and concentrate on that one alone' in fact the multiple character
slots baffled me somewhat, for some reason I assumed that there was a one char
limit. Anyway I have 3 chracters right now and I think you'll probably create
more as you go simply because you will be curious about how the other
races/classes play, It's unlikely that your first choice character will be the
one who enjoy most i.e. play best but if you have already levelled a warrior to
12 why delete him when you create your new guy? by creating new characters you
can vary the gameplay enormously and its really only through trial and error
you will find your favourite character, so dont be shy about having multiple
chars.
