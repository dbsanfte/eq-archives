I play my Ranger not as a primary tank, but as a second line of defence for
the casters and healers.  I can peal a mob in zip time, pull it back to
warriors or lock it down to keep it out of the nukers hair.  If they take
too much an interest in me, I just jolt and off they go to the nearest tank
that has been beating on them.  Works well.  Keeps me from being a manasink
as well.

If you decide on a Ranger, get your fletching skill up in a hurry and MAKE
yourself a good bow.  Do not buy a store bought.  If you have the cash
though, check bazaar out.  Many time good player made bows are for sale up
there.
