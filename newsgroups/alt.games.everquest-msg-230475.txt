<snip>
I normally solo in Skyfire until I get a group invite. Everything I
pull, with the exception of a few different kinds of Drake, is melee
only and do not gate (the Drakes don't gate either, then again they
don't cast much anyway).

Starting sometime after the last patch, every 4th or so pull will just
poof to the other side of the zone when I get them to 20%. It is
aggravating to say the least.
