Well, I logged on and dinged 38 the other night.  Noticed some
interesting things, like highly organized and efficient plat
farmers operating in Rathe Mtns (note that I did not say clever
or imaginative, just organized and efficient), and bazaar pricing
that "felt" higher (much higher) than I recall from the past.

P.S.  In defense of the RM farmers, I rarely had to wait long at all
to find an HG to kill, and only had to kill an occasional PH as the
farmers were if anything even more efficient at slaughtering PHs
then HGs.  So they were organized, efficient, and easy to get along
with.
