This story rather proves my point.

It doesn't take long to find out whether someone knows much about the game.
Also, if they are found to be e-bayers, they get their just desserts.

I really don't think that players dying, because they grouped with someone,
who bought their account on e-bay, and therefore knew nothing about how to
play the game, is much of a problem at all. I can't remember a post saying
"yes, this happened to me".

I should think the bigger problem would be grouping with people, who did
start from scratch, got to a high level, and STILL don't know how to
function correctly in groups.
