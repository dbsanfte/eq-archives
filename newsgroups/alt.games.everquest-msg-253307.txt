It doesn't matter to me.

If all you've got is interaction with figments of their imaginations 
filled out with figments from yours. I don't really count such 
amalgamations of fantasy to even be people, never mind 'friends'.

Suppose an 'online friend', one whom you know nothing ooc about, but 
group with often, and have found to be fun and reliable... and then he 
became greedier and more self-centered, until rifts start to form and 
you drift apart, as he sets off with a group of like minded ubers, 
without so much as a goodbye, and when you try to talk to him, he talks 
down to you etc... until you write him off.

Suddenly you get an ooc tell from him a couple months later (the first 
time he's ever communicated ooc, and he says "hey, its me they guy who 
plays clericX" -- I made a new alt druid, want to group, and acting like 
best friends? Would you be surprised, confused, irritated?

After all -- in his view, he had masterfully and artfully roleplayed his 
cleric an atruistic preist of life through a dramatic transformation to 
powermongering egotist utterly seduced by wealth and power...and he 
thought you two were just roleplaying well.

At least -- he was --  Were you?

A lot of players wear there real life persona on their characters 
sleeve... that's a risky place to have it. Especially if ooc channels of 
communication aren't open between 'friends'.

Sure your neighbour *might* be a whacko despite being neighbourly enough 
to you... but the difference with EQ is that in the real world its safe 
to assume that *most* people are who they present, so assuming the best 
of someone is reasonable. In EQ, the character you are interacting with, 
by definition of "roleplay", is *not*.

You can still assume the best of the 'player behind the character', and 
despite the 'roleplay' the vast majority of people can be taken at face 
value because they aren't roleplaying after all. But even so between how 
little you can see in the virtual world and the fact that what you *do* 
see is *supposed* to be a fabrication anyway... that doesn't leave you 
nearly as much to work with.

Consequently it seems reasonable to me to be *much* more cautious with 
friendship online.

Probably. Many of those whom you consider friends, I consider 
acquaintances... and a few of those friends I wouldn't even acknowlege 
as 'people', never mind people with whom I could be friends. (Not meant 
as a slight against you.)

>    Um.. not that I don't have some serious friendships.  

Of course. I never doubted it.
