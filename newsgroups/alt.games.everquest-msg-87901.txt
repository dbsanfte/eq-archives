I just got Luclin but i am having trouble finding a summary of the
expansion from a role-play perspective.

There is a new race. 
There are several cities.
There are new items. Big deal - there is already more in EQ than i can
actually see/do.

Is there some battle going between the cities? Something that would
make faction actually interesting? (As in something beyond which
merchant can i sell to.)

eqatlas and like provide great maps for each zone as well as quest
info and the eq website tells me how many polygons the models have and
how many new zones there are. Whatever...

What i want to know is more high level than that.  I want to know
about _playing_ Luclin.

Can anyone help me out here?
