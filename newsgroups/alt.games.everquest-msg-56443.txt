My parties are going to be even more annoyed now, as every 12 seconds
they get another round of Bergh healed you for 0 points... each.  The
main tank is going to be pissed that he's only getting 100 point heals,
everyone that isn't injured is going to be pissed that they are getting
spammed.... and I'm not going to care.

I find that I can  go for hours FM or close to it by making like a bard
and string clicking my legs for group heal, with occaisional application
of Celestial, Remedy, and rarely CHeal, no medding needed most
of the time.  I'm always ready for an overpull, and there's no cleric
caused down time.  Is the spam annoying?  Live!
