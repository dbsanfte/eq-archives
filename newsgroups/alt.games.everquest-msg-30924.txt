He should expect about as much roleplay as what you get in any other
area of eq. Roleplayers are a small, core bunch of people that generally
keep to themselves, and they also tend to not talk massive loads of shit
every time they die in PvP (unlike the majority of walking screenshots
that seem to inhabit the server).

Once again, not my problem. I play for PvP so I make the decisions that
are advantageous to me. Not many people have it BOTH ways (a char thats
capable of experiencing lots of raiding and lots of pvp too).

I just don't care. People seem to be hung up on the idea that a pk
actually gives a shit about them. Most don't, they enjoy the fight and
move on after they've done. I don't intentionally totally ruin someones
day unless they are asking for it, and yes you can be more of a pain
than just killing someone once.

True. Occasionally I have very good fights...however most of the time
its a "chase the level 56 naked enchanter around until they die" affair.

You don't always get what you want...

Well given that 99.9999% of people don't use dot slots and seem to not
know wtf to cast, I'm willing to risk putting him in that basket.

No most Zek people are too idealized by the blue experience. Put it this
way, you stroll out of a dungeon after owning hundreds of mobs for a few
hours without a single death and engage in some pvp against a solo
target...just looking at the surface the odds are 50/50 one of you will
come away the "winner" if you both see each other at the same time. Most
people just can't handle that.

In PvP, everyone wants to win, all the time. Some actually go out and
learn how to win, others just sit around blaming anything that they cant
change as the reason why PvP sucks. Its just the way PvP goes in eq...

Correct. Well my whole routine has become second nature, so if all of a
sudden I get hit by an IC out of nowhere I'm not going to panic and shit
my pants and realize "omg im still wearing my uber droppable gear from
that uber raid earlier", try to bag it as fast as possible, try to run
but i get dotted, still panicking, stop and try to heal but a sow'd pet
starts hitting me, run some more, hp's going down, still panicking, fall
off a cliff, almost dead, now walking at a snails pace, try to gate but
die halfway through making the screenshot seem I'm some gimp who can't
even work out how to gate from someone.

It's a lot of little small things that you do when you get attacked that
matter...if I get tashed out of nowhere the first thing I do is cast a
mez potion (always got on hotkeyed in an inv slot, they cost 11pp...and
are invaluable when fighting an enchanter).

Correct.

I don't find day-long raids interesting in the slightest, and any sense
of "uber" in a large encounter with a tough mob is not only dampened by
the fact that I can't land anything on it except my pet, but also that
with 30 people hanging around my frame rate dips into the single
figures...

Yep. By far the best pk class is the wizard, followed by druids and
necro's. Any class can pk, or "pvp", but those 3 are the easiest.

Although now I almost always refuse to PvP vs rogues and *especially*
sk's. Rogues do insane amounts of damage at high levels, and that 900dmg
unresistable, 0.0 cast time HT those sk's have can ruin my day very
quick (esp. seeing as in my self-buffed in resist gear I've only got
1099hp + about 550hp for manaskin). A few swings of that sword and a
lifetap or two and I'm dead.

Hehe. I've got no problem with people getting off on blue server stuff,
however it doesn't interest me in the slightest so I play on the only
server that comes anywhere close to my needs. Its not like theres no
other server where you can raid all day and all night...

The leader was banned for corpse camping someone who's corpse was on the
other side of the zone. When the leader of a guild is banned the guild
is disbanded. RZ has a somewhat non-standard ruleset for PvP. There are
lots of little things that one GM will say is wrong and others will say
theres nothing wrong with them. Which is why most of DB left for sullon
zek, where there are no rules.
