/report only logs the last few lines of a chatbox that are displayed, it 
does not actually place a petition in the queue.  You still need to 
/petition, and reference the /report in that petition.  As someone else 
mentioned, with the possibility of having multiple chatboxes now, you 
need to turn off "always chat here" if you have it on in one of the chat 
boxes, then, do the /report in the chatbox that has the text you want 
reported.
