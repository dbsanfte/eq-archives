I think a lot of poster in a.g.e are so vehemently anti-pvp as a way
to make themselves feel better about their own choice to play on a
boring blue server. They may think their own EQ experience grind is
boring, but at least no one is GRIEFING THEM, so for some reason that
makes them feel better about their dull-ass grind.

I've also noticed that a lot of the antis like to characterize all PvP
players as immature assholes. It goes with the whole mindset. They
must be immature assholes, because they play on the immature asshole
server, right?

Personally, I'm happy that there is choice. I wish PvP was better
supported by Verant, but given that, I think the current situation on
Sullon Zek is pretty damn good.
I mainly wish they'd give us evil team players something to do with
all these insignia coins besides gloat over them.

Check out my characters. I'm a PvP fanatic.

Hagrk - 40 shaman Rallos Zek
Cyrakis - 35 rogue Rallos Zek

Played these guys before realizing how hard some items were to get,
and how easy it was for nasty wizards to take my stuff. When I started
on Rallos, players could loot each others corpses, even if the player
had died to a mob! Not only that, you could loot EVERY SINGLE ITEM
from their body! That was a crazy time.

Naelis - 52 wiz TZ

Played this guy till Tallon Zek turned into cross-teaming bluebie
hell. I'd pay a bunch of money if verant would let me move this guy to
SZ.

Klonk - 58 Shaman SZ

PvP nirvana! Can't wait till I can use spirit call and Virulent
Paralysis on my beloathed enemies!
