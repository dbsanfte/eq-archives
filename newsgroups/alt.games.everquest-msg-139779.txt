I'll have to disagree with what the other posters have said.  While it's 
true that LCD monitors do not have a quick pixel response like their CRT 
counterparts, there are some LCDs that are excellent for gaming.  I have 
the SyncMaster 570V and 570S TFT displays from Samsung, and they are 
both excellent for business apps and games.  When I tried the LCDs for 
the first time over a year ago, I did notice a slight blur with fast 
moving objects.  However, you really had to pay attention in order to 
see it.  Now I don't even notice it.  I play UT and Quake3 Arena 
constantly with these LCDs, and they look terrific!  I see all the 
objects, even fast moving ones, with no problems whatsoever.

The one catch to these monitors is that they are 15" (actual 15" viewing 
area) with a native resolution of 1024x768, up to 32-bit color (normal 
for all monitors), and 75Hz vertical refresh rate; it cannot go beyond 
these.  To use lower resolutions, the SyncMaster LCDs have to downscale 
the image that doesn't look too good on some of the other LCDs. 
However, these Samsung LCDs look terrific even at 640x480.  They 
downscale extremely well once you've adjusted them (the auto adjust 
feature simply rocks on these LCDs).  Due to the 75Hz maximum refresh, 
games even on the most powerful 3D cards cannot exceed 75 FPS if you 
enable v-sync.  I play UT and Quake3 at 1024x768 with 32-bit color and 
v-sync enabled on the Radeon 7200 with a P-III 1Ghz processor, and it 
plays smooth.

Before deciding to make the LCD plunge, have someone demo one for you in 
a store and judge for yourself.  LCDs are still quite expensive compared 
to CRTs, though they are cheaper than when they first hit the market. 
Cheers!
