    If I had to name a near-epic item for an enchanter I'd say the
Cartographer's Quill. 10/18 piercer, PRI slot, STA: +9 INT: +12 HP: +35
MANA: +35
SV FIRE: +5 SV DISEASE: +5 SV COLD: +5 SV MAGIC: +5 SV POISON: +5. Half the
resists, two-thirds the HP/MANA, and half the stats, for 15 K or less. Like
I said in my other post, I still think the enchanter epic is well worth
doing, but when you can just skip all that hassle and get one of these
instead it's tempting.

    And if those poor players want cash, tell them to buy a Mortar and
Pestle and start making Celestial Essences for sale in The Bazaar. I have
yet to see any of the vendors that sell it at 4 pp each (costs less than 2
pp each to make, never fails) have their stock of 200 last overnight, and
the 5 pp sellers almost always sell out overnight. I saw one 5 pp guy sell
500 of 600 he put up for sale, all in one night. Between Celestial Essences
and Spider Silks/Silk Swatches, a young player can make a boatload of cash
with little to no risk and no fear of failure.
