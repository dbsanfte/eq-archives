And I've never found a way to make Gravity (which is, IMO, a 'real' 
newsreader) stop downloading crossposted threads :/ I've /ignored the 
OP, I've /ignored several others obviously not in this group, and I've 
/ignored every new goddamn thread that kept appearing because idiots 
couldn't resist responding.  And I'm STILL getting spammed every day.

On top of that, I somehow got on the xev server forum mailing list, and 
although the original promised to be a "one time mailing only", the 
brainiac who sent it didn't bother hiding the e-mail addresses, and the 
reply-all feature was thus abused.  I am severely grumpy with whoever 
created reply-all and cross-posting right now. :p
