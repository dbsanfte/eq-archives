First, to those who replied to me, I apologize that my post
wasn't clear. (I was tired.) Second, all the replies so far
(mine included) are somewhat speculative --- pieced together
from measurements made with ShowEQ, and posts and replies
that Verant has made about how grouping works over the past
3 years.

That said, I don't think there is a definitive
Verant-sanctioned answer to your question, but I would
tentatively say, "Yes, the level 47 will get less exp when
grouped with the Bard."

In general, Verant isn't in the habit of giving free rides
on exp. In almost every other case mentioned (in which only
a subset of the group is getting exp for a kill), Verant has
usually answered that the exp is divided out and then thrown
away for the people who can't receive it. I can't imagine
this situation being any different (i.e. being "rewarded" by
Verant).
