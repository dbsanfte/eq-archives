I have recently looted a Blue Orc Head in CrushBone and can't find any info
about it anywhere. No one in the game can provide anything more than "It's
for a quest". Any ideas?

Also, as a Rogue approaching Dual Wield, what is the best combination of
weapons to carry? I am currently using a Bloodstained fang. Should I put a
parrying dagger in the other hand, or would a slashing weapon be better in
order to work on both skills?

Thanks for the input.
