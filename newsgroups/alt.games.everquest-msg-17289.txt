I can't really picture what it is you're describing in the second half of
your email (>>My other problem is, if I right click on something in
Inventory...) but you can go here (http://www.cws.org/~pasketti/ ) and get
the INI editor. This is a nifty little app that will change the colors of
the multitude of chat 'modes' (/say, /ooc, /shout, etc.) via RGB slider
bars. There are examples as to how it will show based on what type of chat
box background you have selected. There are also options that allow you to
log in full screen mode, run mode, automatically start a log file... and
speaking about the log file you can also download the file parser that
separates and shows all kinds of information that has happened on your
latest EQ excursion and displays it nicely. Check it out.
