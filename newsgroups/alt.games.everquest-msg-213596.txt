hi,

how does aoe damage work, what's the stupid rule about this
non-straightfoward / counterintuitive feature of eq ?

i have a 35 wiz . . i cast my current level's rain spell (orange background
to spell bar icon)...it doesn't do 3 waves of damage to all 4 mobs, but
rather it does something like 2 hits, then 2 more hits ... is there a 4 hit
maximum, regardless? why isn't that explained on most sites i've seen? and
how come i never heard of this in 3 years of eq?

i cast my current level's other aoe spell, with a green icon bkgd, and that
hits 4 targets, but only once....and eq.crgaming.com lists it as being able
to hit 5 targets, though green bkgd spells are usually unlimited, like
harmony, aoe mez....but then again, aoe snare only catches 4 mobs

so what's the deal?

on graffe's, they say circle of force (the green bkgd spell) is the best AoE
a wiz gets until 49, and that it's the spell that efficient wizards use to
quad kite

but...that's haggard, what about the other one?

and in fact, there's a *third* aoe spell for my level, but it has a stun
component, so i can tell the mana/dmg won't be best

so.......rather quickly, i flipflopped back to being a fan of my
ranger....because the game is upfront about offering bad tanking and worse
archery

so running around SF at the ripe ol' age of 42, i was trying to do some
damage to mobs my gf was fighting on her mage

i was pulling, so most mobs were yellow (i like yellows =P ), but reds would
come too....

i noticed, and i want to ask if anyone else has noticed this too....that
normal melee damage suffers when fighting red cons, but archery damage does
not

sure, archery is still gimp since my ranger isn't super aa man, but it was
fine against reds, compared to blues / whites / whatever

vive le rangers (not the hockey team)
