Essential.

Important if the puller has demonstrated a tendency to run off =)

> Chanter tells the group, 'Mesmerizing an Uglymob! Don't attack it please!'

Essential.

Conceivably necessary, although it's a stretch - for whatever reason this
mob needs to be absolutely dead RIGHT NOW, hence nukers are possibly going
to draw aggro, hence healer needs to know how much aggro they are possible
going to draw. A stretch, as I said =) In the normal run of things this is
just spam.

> Shaman tells the group, 'The an Uglymob has been slowed!'

Tells the healer that the damage being taken by the tanks is about to drop,
possible dramatically - therefore if a CHeal has been started it might be
worth ducking it and catching a tick of med.

> Chanter tells the group, 'debuffing magic resistance for a an Uglymob'

Tells all casters they can now cast profitably.

Well yes, it's safe to assume that slower will be slowing and debuffer will
be debuffing, but unless slower can always spot the Tash message, it's nice
for slower to know when debuffer has debuffed =)
