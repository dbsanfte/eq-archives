I understand where people are coming from claiming it's no big deal, and 
people should get over it and move on.

But people who *congratulate* people on freeing the Sleeper?  Umm... why 
in the world would you congratulate them?  Killing Ventaani is an 
accomplishement, yeah, but intentionally dropping all warders at once 
really doesn't accomplish anything for anyone.  Not even the guild setting 
him free.  All they get out of it is a jolly laugh that they are removing 
a lot of pretty nice content from the game.
