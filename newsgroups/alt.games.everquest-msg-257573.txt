We pay for new -content- in the form of expansions.
We pay for bug fixes as part of our subscription fees. (some games even 
give you new content with the subscription fees, but not EQ to a

If I had to shell out 13 bucks a month, plus another 60+ bucks a year 
for expansions to use an ATM it had better do some new tricks.
