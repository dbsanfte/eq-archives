Actually the scout needs to be bagless to start the quest and turn in the
tool kit. When turning in the Robe the Scout usually has a bag. Heres the
steps and where Im concerned:

1. Hand bag to baggless scout which spawns giants
2. Kill giant and get no drop cog thing
3. Turn in cog to bagged scout recieve robe
4. Turn in robe to scout receive bracer
5. Turn in bracer to scout and get something else.

Step 4 is what Im concerned about. I did not immediately turn in the robe in
exchange for the bracer and she despawned. When she respawns she will not
have a bag. I am curious if it matters for Step 4.
