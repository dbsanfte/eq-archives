If you mean Oleuna Milton (I *think* spelled that right) --
there are no other female NPC's on the E.FP docks with
a fishing pole -- then no, she's on FreeportMilitia faction.
I'm 100% positive.

On the other hand, there's a female Dark Elf NPC who
spawns at night farther down the "shore", who is sometimes
trained to the docks.  I forget what faction she's on,
but she's KoS to lots of folks.
