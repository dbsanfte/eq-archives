}So you really should not give it something veeery good?

Yes, the weapon will be gone unless all of the following apply:  

(1) It was a charmed, not summoned, pet.
(2) It was killed by PCs after charm broke, and not NPCs while charmed or 
    not.
(3) The weapon was not no drop.

}And does anyone know if a Beastlord pet have any advantage of weapons? (ie.
}it cant hold any weapons cos mine is a tiger, and bashes, claws, kicks..
}whatever as it is.. )

I don't think so... but I didn't experiment with it much.
