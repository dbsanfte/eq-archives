Lately I have been having trouble with song timing. It is taking like a half
second after the casting bar disappears before I get the song message. If I
start a new song before I get the casting message then the first song does
not complete. If I watch the chat window and wait for the message I can
barely keep 3 songs up. I used to be able to twist 3 songs easily and 4 if I
worked at it.  This is not internet lag as my meter shows 100ms latency and
0% packetloss.  Is anyone else seeing this, and does anyone know a cure?
