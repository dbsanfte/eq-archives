Never have I gotten the impression that all druids were jerks.  Heck, I can't
even name one druid I think is a jerk.  Only person I can specifically name as a
jerk is this halfling rogue named Nastylittlehobbit on Vazaelle.  His name says
it all, he's rude and a kill stealer and says "I was camping this before you"
when he was nowhere in sight as I tried casting a root on a goblin and then he
came running up and stole the kill.  But I digress.  Never label an entire class
as jerks, take each person individually and make that decision only if you have
been around them for a while and seen how they react to more people than just
yourself.
