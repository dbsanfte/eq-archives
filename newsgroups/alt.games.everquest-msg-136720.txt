Interesting idea.  Could the company be responsible for international
terroism.

I find the concept of the U.S. being "under scrutiny" for the World Court
issue to be laughable.  It's simply an attempt to grab U.S. soverigenty.
Sorry, but I have no faith in the U.S. government, what makes you think I'll
trust a bunch of U.S.-haters more?

I'll keep my eye on that, but the U.N. doesn't have a very good track record
for evaluation alleged U.S. abuses.  Why we continue to support that crowd
is a puzzle to me.  It's better to call your opponents out into the open,
then to pretend not to notice them.
