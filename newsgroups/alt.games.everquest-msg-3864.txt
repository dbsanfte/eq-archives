Yes, absolutely.

What you bring to a dungeon group at upper levels is much the same as
you do at lower levels - namely, flexibility.

Hughes is correct in his statement that "Your job can always be filled
much better by someother class", but that statement ignores the fact
that you can step into a wide variety of roles, to fill several gaps
in a party.

You've got snare, DoTs, damage shields and regen. You can act as a
backup healer. You've got tracking, to see when a rare named is up in
the dungeon. You've got evac to haul your team to safety if need be.
And your direct damage spells, while not on a par with those of some
other classes, can still be quite valuable in a pinch.

Yes, other classes trump you in each of these areas, but the druid is
the only class that can lay all this on the table and be able to fill
in as needed.
