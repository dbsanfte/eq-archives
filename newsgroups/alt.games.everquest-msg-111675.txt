At the very least, it does appear to show that it is pretty darned close to
the formula.  Eyeballing the mana bar is not a good way to really determine
the amount of mana left.  I don't know what percentage of mana is lot to a
fizzle, but when I fizzle a high mana cost spell, it is a noticeable amount
on the mana bar.

You are welcome.
