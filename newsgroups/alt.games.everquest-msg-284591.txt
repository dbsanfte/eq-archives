I'm not sure this is true because mobs were specifically kept as Dark 
Blue to level 65 when the 5 new levels went in with PoP.  One of the 
player-base complaints was that too much went LB/Green with the extra 5 
levels, so they rejigged it.  So there's at least one point where the 
level range is extended past the previous rules.
