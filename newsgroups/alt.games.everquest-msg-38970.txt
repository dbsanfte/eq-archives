My first cleric went 49 levels with no last name... and I often
wish I'd done the same with Bergh.  The last name does nothing
for you except give you a "I hit twenty" badge... which is
satisfying until you get to 21 or so.  Having no surname, though,
says "Yeah, sure, I could have one, but I chose not to"... or
perhaps it says "I like to be able to duck out from under the
kan-u-res-and-buf-me-pls radar"

34 is a little scary for iceclad still, but you are near the high
end for tizmaks in Great Divide, or low end (need a good group)
for Kodiaks.  Drakkal dire wolves should be soloable (or
Coldain Tracking Wolves if you want to befriend the giants)
and again you are to the low end for frost giant scouts in a group
(or some of the Coldain...)

You could also happily do lower level Ulthorks and some of
the wildlife solo or in small groups in Eastern Wastes, I'd stay
away from the rygorr for a while although you can handle the
lower level spawns there in a group if someone else is taking
out the hard stuff.

You can also look forward to hunting in the Wakening Lands,
Holgresh and Tigerraptors at least should be good for you,
although I can't say, since I foolishly avoided the zone until
my high 40s, by which point most everything there is green.
Get a guide to show you the way thru Kael Drakkar several
times till you know it well, since you can camo it won't cost
you 10pp like it does me if I want to make the run solo.
