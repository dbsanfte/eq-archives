I have gotten great advice here, and set up a website for my guild, for
laughs, and decided to share it to a wider group...

http://www.geocities.com/merlinstn/night_vision.html

Couple of things -

Make sure to hit the links at the bottom for other web pages...
Am especially proud of the page "Look!  I got SOW now!'  Took about 200 hits
getting that page right...

This is rough, did an all night run Tuesday night, and woke up in the
afternoon deciding to memorialize the evening on line... Still, I think it
is not too bad for a few hours work...

Please check it out and let me know what you think - maybe five minutes to
scan whole thing right now...
