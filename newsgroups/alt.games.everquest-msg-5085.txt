Crafted is good enough armor that you probably won't be replacing 
it until you start getting your Indolicite armor on the Planes.  
There's not much in between that is worth the price to pay for it.

One really nice deal these days is the Mithril Staff.  It's a 
2hblunt weapon, and you might not have practiced it at all, but 
it sells for 400pp these days, and that's a terrific price for a 
28 damage 45 delay weapon.  Double-hitting for 100 is quite nice.
