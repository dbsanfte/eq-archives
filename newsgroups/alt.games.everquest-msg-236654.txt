I used to play everquest and what I loved most about it was the friends I
met. I played on the server Vazaelle but sadly I had to suddenly quit. I was
wondering if anyone would mind going on the Vazaelle server and see if like
4 or 5 of my friends still play and if you could get me their emails so I
could try to get back in touch. If you are interested please email me at
crisser32@email.com. Your help is greatly appreciated, Thanks!
