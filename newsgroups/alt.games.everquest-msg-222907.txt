I took my lowbie ranger there (L56 at the time) and the entire zone,
other than the two wayfarers, was green. Killed a couple mobs and from
that I'd judge they were no more than L20 if that; quite possibly
lower. The two wayfarers have nothing really interesting to say other
than that they're building a very large ship; nothing you couldn't
have gotten from the story window blurb. Also the jaggedpine crystal
for zoning to surefall seemed to be bugged on test; it sent you back
to nedaria.

The mob density is such that this looks like it would be a good lowbie
(L20) exp zone as long as you're okay with killing animals (the entire
zone is animals), but for the moment has absolutely nothing to offer
anyone else.

Speculation is that the ship they are building will be zone sized
itself, and will be much like Plane of Tranquility is now for the next
expansion.

Also some of us were looking at the story blurb and wondering if the
devs are planning on wiping out a bunch of old world zones in a
catastrophe (hey it can happen in AC1, a far older game), and
replacing them with these new ones.
