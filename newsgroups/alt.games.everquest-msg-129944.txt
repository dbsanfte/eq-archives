Hmm.  I'm so suprised that you didn't say "The British bombing
of Dresden was morally justified, because it was done
by an army, against a war enemy, and the deaths of
the civilians there were just regrettable collateral
damage" - that would fit in with your spinning for
Israel in this thread.

You know this boils down to "Israeli bombs are justified,
and Palestinian ones are not because I say so" don't
you?
