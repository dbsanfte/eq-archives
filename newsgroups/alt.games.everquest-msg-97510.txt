I'd have to agree with the player's reaction in this case, my response would
prolly be similar if a GM suddenly threatened to suspend me for something I
hadn't done. It's not like he had happened upon an exploit and was claiming
ignorance of it, he was using an in game item/ability.
Not sure I'd quit over it but my response to the GM would likely have been
similar "learn your own game"
Had the death been exp loss, well, nm.
Lost a tourney that I could have won, such is life, sometimes.
But accused of cheating by a server admin, sorry, someone really needs to
get their facts straight before throwing that one around.

I still say I have yet to have a bad experience with a GM but that isn't to
say it never happens and if one was to accuse me of cheating in a PvP
tourny, I'd certainly mark that down as a bad experience.
