The difference is that there are many families waiting to adopt an unwanted 
child, while an unwanted cat will go wild or get killed. Also, a human can 
say "I can't afford a child" or "I'm not ready for a child". Also, I don't 
think they make kitty condoms, and if the did I don't think even my 
smartest cat could get one on. Well, thats a few differences anyway. If you 
are confused about the difference between animals and people I can 
continue.
