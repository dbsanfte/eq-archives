hardly, 35 and up bards make one of my favorite additions to any group. the
mana song stacks with clarity.

charm song can be a life saver

heal song is a mana saver between fights

the battle hymns increase the over all power for the tanks

and he's right,to a certain extent, druids spend so much time solo they
start thinking they are wizards and forget they are also healer
i forgive the druids this up to about lv 20, after that if they haven't
figured it out then i get angry
his group (and him in particular) should have worked out everyones role
BEFORE the 1st pull was ever made
