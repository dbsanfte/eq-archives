It's funny what gets accused of being bad sometimes.

I needed a directory with 10000 test files in it, to check the performance of
something when dealing with a lot of files, so ran this shell script (I use the
Cygwin tools, so get to run bash shell scripts on Windows):

    N=0
    while [ $N -lt 10000 ]
    do
        echo $N > file.$N
        N=$((N+1))
    done

That tries to create 10000 files, named file.0, file.1, ..., file.9999, where
file.N contains the number N as a string.

Imagine my surprise when Norton stopped this at something like file.483,
claiming that the file that had just been created contained a backdoor!
