Hehe, after a WC event I decided to stick around for a while and kill some
spiders and bears for tailoring stuff.

I target a young Kodiac, send in pet, sit down, see pet kill bear, see pet
run off wild, think it's lag, see the message "Gobaner has slain Kizdean
Gix", /laugh madly, went on with my life.

Got almost 3 stacks of spider silks and an immense feeling of justice that
night :)
