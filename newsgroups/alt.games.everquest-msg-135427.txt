Go to Felwithe, you can buy all the ingredients there, both molds and
ore.  I then did an /ooc for a smith over 50, met him at the newbie
ramp in Kelethin, only one or two platforms to a furnace that will
combine for the knife.   Took me less than 30 minutes from the time I
arrived in Faydwer til I had my skinning knife........
