To make it even more confusing, Tom, who is listening to the channel in
another zone, and fighting a_mob_not_appearing_in_the_raid_zone, will hear
that "a_mob_not_appearing_in_the_raid_zone is incoming," and will wonder
what the heck is up with that. (which is how I noticed the bug. I was
fighting crag spiders in EK, which I know darn well don't exist in Dragon
Necropolis).

For the poor clerics, Bob is healing %T, who Bob thinks is Jack. But Jane,
who thinks Bill needs a heal, thinks Bob just announced he's healing Bill...
so Bill dies, and Jane thinks Bob isn't doing their job. This bug can get
you killed.
