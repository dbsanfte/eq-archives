Yes, this is very, very old.  =)  It's still quite funny... I chuckle every
time.

Nevertheless, it was based on a game that's different from the game today.
To wit:

Necros are no longer the gods they once were.  Their pets especially got hit
by the nerf bat really really hard.  This obviously pro-Necro piece is quite
out of sync with today's game.

A platinum ruby veil goes for 100pp in the Bazaar now.

"Cleric: Okay, Warrior, Necromancer, Bard, Enchanter, Shaman, you're with
me"

That's not necessarily the group I'd chose these days.  =)

Eye of Zomm no longer aggros.

"Magician begins to cast a spell
Ranger is enveloped in fire
Shaman: Well at least he's useful now"

That made me laugh out loud the first time I read it.  =)  Rangers being
useless is a long-standing joke.  I remember another story about a Naggy
raid in which the clerics, at the beginning of the raid, make a list of all
rangers in the raid to make it easier to figure out who needs a rez at the
end.  All the jokes aside, rangers are now awesome DPS, especially when they
get AM3, and WS is an essential skill in high-end raiding.

"A Sky Blue Dragon hits Druid for 500 damage
A Sky Blue Dragon hits Druid for 500 damage
Cleric begins to cast a spell
Paladin begins to cast a spell
Druid feels a healing touch
Cleric: %*^
Paladin: Sorry"

This, alas, still happens.  =)  Still, I like being grouped with a Paladin;
their group healing spells complement my own heals quite nicely.

"Necromancer casts a spell
Cleric is revived with 93% exp regain
Necromancer: A newbie gave his life for that"

=)  Another chuckle, but of course you have to be at least 46 to be able to
be sacrificed for EE's.  While some people would still call a 46 character a
"newbie", most would not.

"A Sky Blue Dragon has been slain by Necromancer's DOT
A Sky Blue Dragon has left no corpse
GroupOf13 look at Necromancer"

DoT's haven't made corpses poof for years, so that particular joke would be
met with a blank stare by the majority of current EQ players.

Of course, the ending is still apropos, and as always makes me laugh:

"Enchanter has cast a spell
CrowdODragons has been mezzed
Enchanter gates away
Casters gate away
PeopleWithoutGate sigh
PeopleWithoutGate are slain, roasted, and served with a white wine
CrowdODragons disperses
Necromancer stands and gates
Shadowknight can no longer play dead
Shadowknight is roasted by dragonfire
Shadowknight has been slain
Monk sighs"

Anyway, that post was a good trip down memory lane.  I remember laughing and
laughing the first time I read it.  =)
