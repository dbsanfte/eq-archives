Nearly everyone does seem to have trouble releasing MMORPGs and their
expansions, but it turns out that it is not actually required to have
these kinds of problems.  DAoC, in the two months since launch, has
had a couple of emergency patches that took the game down for about an
hour each, and I'm aware of one server crashing and being down for
about an hour.  They had a few days where a lot of people were getting
bad connections, which numerous traceroutes narrowed down to a
specific major ISP.  They've done about one patch a week...which goes
onto the test server, is tested for a few days, and then goes live,
which involves the servers going down for an hour or so.  I know some
people who had client problems on XP, which could be fixed by simply
going to the "compatibility mode" tab and setting it to Win98.  They
actually had this level of stability by beta 4.

So, why can't the other game companies do that?  More importantly, now
that players have seen that it *can* be done, are the players going to
be a lot less tolerant of buggy releases and expansions?
