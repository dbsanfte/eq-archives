I'd say overthere on a ledge group.  I went from 33 to 40 there really
quick.  At 40 I'm still getting experience but none of the groups want me.
When I do manage to find a group I pull like crazy and beat down everything
in sight.  Everyone says they are still getting good experience with me in
the group but I think it's time to find a new place to play.
