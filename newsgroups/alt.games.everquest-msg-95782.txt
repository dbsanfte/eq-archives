I've no idea what might have trashed your faction, but the possibility
of a game error looms large.

You could petition, but personally, even if it is a game error and
therefore Verant should fix it for you, I think you'll be wasting your
time. By the time anyone responds, believes you, digs through the logs
to verify your claim, and gets a technician to correct your faction,
you could have easily fixed it yourself by whacking low level goblins
in Butcherblock.



Dammit! I got some Vegemite on my giant mouse pad. I wonder if I'll be
able to clean that out.
