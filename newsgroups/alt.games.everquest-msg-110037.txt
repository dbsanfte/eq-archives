Can't speak for DAOC, but the problem in D2 is that your items can only be 
repaired by NPCs, and it'll always be for a price set by the level of your 
weapon instead of by "market demand".  In EQ2 and SWG, decay will be 
reparable by other players, and the price for that will likely adjust 
itself to whatever the demand for it is.  At that point, the main balance 
issue is making sure you can go for a game-week-long raid without having to 
hit up a smith five times.  Including things like polishing rags and 
sharpening stones that you can use to portably repair your weapon and armor 
from minor damage would help.  Having an intelligent decay rate (say, a 
game-year or so for your bog-standard weapon) would also help.

I think that achieving playable item decay is completely attainable, and 
that it's a vital component of a functioning player economy.  I'm really 
looking forward to its inclusion in the new games.
