The other day in Mid-sands we had harmony resisted - and 3 mobs in
camp.  During a hectic fight someone apparently OOC'd a camp check,
to which none of us responded.  5 minutes later he and his friends 
show up to see us killing the Wolf named, and start screaming and
yelling that we took their camp.  Apparently they "called" Mid-sands
from the zone-in after no one responded.

From which anecdote we get 3 of the rules I work under:

1.  No one is under any obligation to call a camp they are at - the
very act of being there and clearing it is sufficient claim to it.

2.  "Calling" a camp from zone in doesn't grant you any rights to the
camp - get your ass up there and start clearing if you want it.

3.  Screaming and yelling about how people who've been there for 2 hours
are camp stealers only makes you look like a complete moron to the rest
of the zone.
