(See what a nice guy I am? I fixed your top posting problem)
The number of people I've seen come stoming in here over the last 18
months screaming that they were quitting, cancelling all fifty of their
accounts, etc. etc. has led to one conclusion for me. If even half of
them did it, the servers would be empty. It's all hot air, and they will
be back in the game with the rest tomorrow. Grumbling, perhaps, but
paying the higher rate and playing anyway.
