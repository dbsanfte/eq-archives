Sure, you still lose the gear. But there's a big emotional difference between
finding out they're going to wipe your gear in a week (one week left to say
goodbye to that high-end armour you just got), and logging on to find your
character stark naked with no warning. Yes, both options are tough, but I'd rather
get the heads-up.
