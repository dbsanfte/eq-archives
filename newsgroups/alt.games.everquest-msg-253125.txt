Hi gang!

I have a 39 Chanter on Stromm.

My question pertains to the clarity/clarity2/kei spells.

I can get C2 cast on me when I'm level 41, but my chanter can't cast it
until he's level 42.  I can get kei cast on me when i'm 45, but I can't cast
it until I'm 60.

What good does this do me within a group?  If i'm in a group in the mid-40's
level, casting C1 on casters at that level makes about as much sense as
casting breeze at level 35.  It does no good.  Why can't chanters cast c2
and KEI at the lower levels?

Lou
