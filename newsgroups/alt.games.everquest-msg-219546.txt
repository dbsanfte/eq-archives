   Yeah, pretty much all the time.  A couple of nights ago, I dreamt that I was
killing the neighbor's kittens for experience (in RL they have the deplorable
"Oh, it's no big deal to not get the cat fixed" attitude).  Then I realized that
I was killing _kittens_ for godsake, and took them home and adopted them (in RL
have recently adopted two kittens, one of which was feral and about to die of
starvation).  

    That's pretty much how my EQ dreams seem to go.  A weird blending of real
life and eq.  Like Lenny and I will be trying to do an involved quest that
involves going to the grocery store, arena, and cleric's guild.  Or we'll be
driving through the Karanas.  Stuff like that.
