ok, so assuming I wander to a new area (say Kunark) explore.

With all my gear I am reasonable. But if I die its a long way back from my
respawn point. And I really wouldn't want to loose my gear, so I would have
no choice but to make the long journey to recover my corpse, followed by a
long journey back to saftey.

Clearly, as a SK I cannot bind myself, and I know from past experience that
you cannot always rely on being able to find someone to bind you when (if)
you arrive at a new city.

Just wondering, what safe guards do other players use, to protect themselves
from dieing in an awkward to reach place?

- Once played a Barbarian warrior (10ish) who I managed to get from the
Barbarian city to Freeport, dodging Minotaurs and Rock Men etc. Upon
arriving at West Commonlands I was attacked by a Kodiak, which I managed to
kill, but with only 1 hit point left! Then an orc pawn wandered past, hit me
with a lucky swipe, and killed me!


AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!




"You hit the wrong ship!"
    "It wasn't my fault!"
"Well, then whose fault was it, the torpedo's?"

- the doctor and EMH2
