[Ranger down!]

I ignored the part about rangers (stupid mana sponges!) and will focus
on the OT part of your post:

If you read the books, go see this movie now! Sure, it's not a hundred
percent accurate, and some stuff was cut due to time constraints, BUT!
I loved it to bits. It was better than I hoped it would be. Shucks, it
was better than I thought it possible to be! My jaw kept dropping, and
I was leaning forward, eyes darting hither and thither, trying to soak
up all the details. I hope this thing makes a billion bucks and sweeps
the Oscars, and I can't wait for the Two Towers to come out!

If you haven't read the books, I predict that you'll want to after you
see this movie. It's that good. The three hours flew by like you would
not believe. In fact, it might be a more rewarding movie experience if
you haven't read the books yet, as you won't be bothered by the things
they changed (which I'll discuss in the spoiler section below).

One thing to keep in mind, though:  If you have young kids, you should
consider hiring a babysitter for them. Peter Jackson started out doing
splatter movies, and it kinda shows. There are some scary bits in this
movie, and I wouldn't let someone under 12 go to it. All that said, it
isn't Bad Taste part II or something. Just a bit intense for the kids.

Rune, suddenly sad that the Middle Earth MMOG died now...




HERE BE SPOILERS!

(Hope this is a Ctrl-L, it should be if I understand this editor correctly:)




The Good:

Yes, Legolas was WAY COOL, the way he unloaded arrow after arrow
into the orcs and Uruk-Hai rocked!

The locations were spectacular, particularly Rivendell and the
Gates of Gondor. Oh, and the Shire looked just as I imagined it!

The set design was magnificent, as were the costumes.

First-rate acting, always a plus.

The special effects were mostly very good.


The Bad:

Some parts were summarily excised from the movie, for instance
Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wight. I understand that they had
to cut stuff due to time constraints, though.

Gimli got too few lines, I think he spoke about four times or so...
But the dwarves looked Just Right, at least.

Some parts were changed, for no apparent reason. For instance,
Arwen rode to Rivendell with the dying Frodo, instead of Glorfindel.
Also, Gollum apparently was a monster from the get-go, rather than
being slowly corrupted by the One Ring.


That's really all I can think of when it comes to bad stuff, and some
of it feels like fanboy nitpicking...

Coolest set: The New and Improved Isengard, now with extra Orcs!

Coolest monster: The Balrog, duh!

Coolest prop: Sting, at least when it wasn't glowing. The glow looked
kinda like an effect from a bad 80's Sci-fi movie...

Best actor: Ian McKellan, no doubt.
