 Today i was in a full group:
1) Me lvl 45 SK troll
2) lvl 44 irskar monk?
3) lvl 48 necro edu
4) lvl 43 cleric human
5) lvl 44 wizz high elf
6) lvl 41 bard human?

 Everything was going well until i noticed standing next to me meleeing..was
the cleric...hitting for about 4-14 damage..and the necros pet was making her
look bad bad bad...but heres the kicker...she wouldnt heal until we were down
to 1-1/2 bubbles of health..andi t was always complete heals...now..im not sure
but i think this is pretty risky move...and actully pissing me off a lil as
well as the monk..at one point FD death due to low health and i was low as well
hit taunt to try to get the agro..wack wack im about dead she heals the monk i
FD..wack wack wack..cleric is now runnin...dead..i lay there while everyone is
getting slamed wizard didnt have a chance......and the bard turned on the nitro
a zoned..now the question is...do most cleric do this tactic? this is prolly
the first cleric ive seen that would only use complete heals..odd?
