Nope... I'm average.  Better than some... worse than others.

But I excell at one thing... I'm always learning more.

As I probably know 2 wizards better than myself, and figure there's another
out there I haven't talked to yet, I suppose I'd be the pre-ante-penultimate
wizard on my server.
Or do you know what penultimate means?

It is VERY simple.
We finish the mob in less time.
Saving the tanks hp and the cleric's mana.  (You do know that mana
regenerates faster than HP, don't you?)

Specifically (in typical exp grinds) we blast the mob APART right about the
time that it becomes (nearly) immune to melee, and hits twice as hard.
(Berserk... you were aware that mobs do that, right?)

Went through 35 in 6.25 hours of play time... is that a good enough grind
for you?

Lately I haven't been in a good grind... mostly because I can't get a
group... someone seems to think that wizards are less desirable than... well
"anything else."

Trying to argue with you is pointless, Sang, for whatever reason, you
clearly don't understand the concept and usefulness of fire support.

You may take your last word now, I'm done.
