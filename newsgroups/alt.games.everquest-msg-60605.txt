    From what I've read, at one point the zone was going to be larger than
it is. The key is the key to the "other part" of Unrest which was never
opened. I guess the idea of even more trains eventually dissuaded someone
from making the zone bigger. That, and they had to fix what was there - Hags
with Charm was just a bit too much.
