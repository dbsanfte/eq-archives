I've been trying for many days now to get some Goblin Bracers (No Drop
AC,+MR - Cha) off of the Battlemaster Goblins in Warsliks Woods, LOIO
and FV.  After using my handy-dandy EQ Log File Parser to see how many
I've killed (about a 120 now), I am beginning to wonder if these no
drop items haven't been done away with?  I am playing on Rallos Zek
(pvp) and it seems like the drop rates for items listed on spoiler
sites as common (ie, not too hard to acquire) are MUCH harder to
acquire on this pvp server. Others who are looking for the same item
have mentioned this kind of difficulty too. On blue servers a few
months ago I had no problem getting several of them in just a long day
of play.

I had a very similar problem with acquiring an RBF from the Froglok
Squire.  It took almost 2 weeks weeks of camping 8 hours every day to
get one of those (on Rallos Zek).  I've hunted these items both solo
and in groups.  While I think the RBF might have just been life at the
wrong side of the random number generator, the number of people
complaining about not being able to get Goblin Bracers seems unusual.

So... is it:

1)  Some type of setting specific to the pvp server?
2)  A recent change (due to patch error or by design)?
3)  Some kind of Trivial Loot Code (most are green, some are light
blue)?

TIA for any useful thoughts on this subject.
