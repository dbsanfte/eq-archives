The nukes a druid has at 39 aren't that great, especially the AoE
ones. You could get decent experience in The Overthere, but might want
to try The Dreadlands. You will however at 49 get Lightning blast
which is very effective. I used to quad kite the undead skeles and
apes in Burning wood. There is a hut there (a bit off from the giant
fort) with 6 of them on a decent timer and plenty of room to kite with
rarely if ever a wanderer (sometimes people fear the giants there if
they get adds) and of course you can try the giants but watch for the
named ones they have a lot of hps. Think I stayed in OT till I was 42
or so (when things turned light blue too often). DL is nice to kite
near the grass/dirt outside KC as long as no groups there to
interfere. Try not to kite casters if you can help it.

Basically you snare a mob then lead it away, grab another by snaring
and leading away, and when you get four mobs, line them up so they are
as close as possible by running sometimes in a small circle so they
bunch up. Then nuke away. If you are Low on Mana, run a bit further
and med for a few seconds in between nukes, otherwise get gate ready
and pray you have enough mana. You must make sure the area you are
kiting in is mostly free from adds or you will die or have to gate
often.

Hope that helps.
