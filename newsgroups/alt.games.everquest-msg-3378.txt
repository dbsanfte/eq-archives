I'll agree that the uprise of *make me an offer* has increased and I find it
more then a tad annoying.
It used to be people would /auction WTS thingy for Xpp, give tells. If there
was uncertainty in how much they should charge, people would do /auction PC
on thingamabob if they weren't sure. People still do that, but it's becoming
a waste of time purchasing things from people who auction now because they
don't have a bloody clue how much they want to charge you to begin with.

If you're one of those *make me an offer* types, please try to do a price
check or ask people in your guild what you should ask as a price. Hell go
look up on the net for your server to see the latest listed price and work
from there instead of making people waste thier time. Or is it the lack of
other types of conversation that makes this type of sale so appealing to
you? Suggestion, you aren't going to make friends on eq by making them waste
thier time haggeling with you.

And since we're on the topic of Auction Etiquette. Why is the number of
people growing, who are auctioning things, using /shout instead?
Maybe I'm just moody when it comes to that, but I find it annoying that I've
shut off /auction to avoid spam (since maybe that particular day I dont want
to buy anything or can afford it), but yet I still have to see this crap
spamming my chat.
