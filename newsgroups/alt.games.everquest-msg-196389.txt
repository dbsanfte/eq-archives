Um, does STA over 200 give less benefit like INT/WIS over 200 give less
mana?  That's the only way I can figure that a 65 Warrior would get only
3hp/STA.  Shouldn't you be getting 6.5hp/STA?  My 55 Paladin gets about
4.2hp/STA (55/13), my 32 Warrior gets 3.2hp/STA (32/10), but I don't
think either has ever had STA over 200.
