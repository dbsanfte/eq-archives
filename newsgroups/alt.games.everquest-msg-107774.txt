I'm only the vocalization, I'm not the only person who supports the nerf.
The opposite applies to you.  We support opposing sides of an argument, and
neither of us can put forth evidence or premises that would change the
opinion of the other side.

If they don't nerf it, you'll be happy, and I won't care because nothing
changed.
If they do nerf it, I'll be happy and buy one, and you'll call all of the
people who do the same as me childish greedy bastards.
