definitely under 7 days

the first kitty (when luclin came out) got 60 in 3ish days (servers were up
and down and up and down on patch day, so that's an -ish of a day)

and if i remember correctly, there were still the hell levels 54 and 59 in
place (those two remained for a while after they removed 40 and 45 [and 35
was never that bad])

we all wanted to know what a beastlord could do.....but that
3-ish-days-to-60 BL was no clue - he was the resident uber guild's property
and they didn't let on much

/sigh
