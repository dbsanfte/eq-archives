I also have a druid and shaman, the druid is a human in qeynos and
the shaman is an iksar in new cabilis, i like both i admit and since
i will soon have a guy of almost every class it can be hard to focus
on one, my main is a DE necro that is now alone in lavastorm (lvl 14)
My barbarian warrior shows me that i really miss the spellcasting
part, since you can cast a low lvl spell to get the mob's attention
now i have to run up to them and hit them, feels more risky.

Freeport i don't like that much, shure the newbie areas are good and 
you have both EC and N ro nearby and also nektulos and neriak but
i still prefer qeynos, a more comfy town i guess.
