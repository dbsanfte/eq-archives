    Yes. Lenny won't have as many HPs, but he will end up putting out more
damage than he did before and he has some pretty nifty utility things he can
do. You can also do a lot more places as a duo with Lenny 2.0, as between
his feign/snare pulling and your Pacify line there's not going to be many
camps the two of you can't break. He's also better suited for indoor duty,
because of the Darkness line.

    What part of the "higher end game" do you mean? In raiding post-55, the
warrior is king. Without a warrior, frequently there is no raid. But SK's
have some nice things they bring to a raid, like feign/snare pulling before
your bards get the Fading Memories AA. They also make excellent offtanks
when a pile of mobs comes to camp, as they can pull one out of the crowd and
glue it to themselves. So while Lenny won't be the king of raids, he will
make a nice Prince of the Pull. (That's something he should practice
whenever he can, BTW - splitting mobs. A good puller will always find an
end-game job.)

    Where he should be! :-)

    The most important point is this: is Lenny happy being a Shadow Knight?
If he is, then that's all there is to it.
