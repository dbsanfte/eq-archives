Just going back to what I used to do with my monk, try adding a /pause
5 instead. If things are a bit laggy, I think EQ sometimes gets
confused about when exactly you turned off your autoattack and things
can overlap. At times I'd have no trouble feigning with autoattack on
and other times it just wouldn't work about half the time. Adding a
pause (automatic or manual) between when attack was turned off and the
next action was inititiated always seemed to take care of the problem.
