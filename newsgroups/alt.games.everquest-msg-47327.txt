You should include dark elves and all evils basically. Without dark
elves your guild will be missing the all important clerics and
chanters, well and wizards (port action)

Problem is that I don't think ogre or troll start speaking the other's
language do they? So you'll have to level and probably put points into
human and common like everyone else to communicate. All my dark elf
had as a language was dark elf, with zero in human at the trainer. It
had NO troll or ogre at trainer at all.

Have you started a troll or ogre on test FV to see if it starts with
BOTH troll and ogre as langs?

When I was on my dark elf cleric I saw a troll who i believe was
asking for a bind in east freeport but no humans could understand him
and my dark elf could not either.

Not without the missing needed classes eventually, though you'd be
more or less fine without enchanters or clerics to 39 or 40.. albeit
rather slowed down.

Fun idea, but I'd include dark elves at least eventually. Also you
need to check on if the trolls and ogre start with BOTH troll and ogre
language earned or only their respective ones. 
Maybe you already did.
I ASSumed my dark elf would have common learned being so close to
humans and that it might even have troll ogre and iksar since they are
"Evil" but it did not.

If ogres and trolls can speak I'd let the evil guild know the bulk of
its training points should go into human common at the trainer so that
the eventual needed inclusion of dark elf would have a common ground. 
They elevated my dark elf to like 24 but I ran out of  money before I
could raise human common a lot to see if by 20 or so it would be
understandable. Theoretically you could get common to at least 100 by
level 22 or so if you only put a point or two into new training items
and the rest into common. That would probably be enough.

My barbarian sharman I started next DOES have both barbarian and human
common equally high, which is convenient.
