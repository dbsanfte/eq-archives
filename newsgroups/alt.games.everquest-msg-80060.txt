Tyger, I don't know why you are so upset over the use of the word Drow, but
a lot of people do use that term to describe the Dark Elves in Everquest.
And, considering that Everquest is nothing more than Computerized AD&D, I
don't see much wrong with that term.  Yes, I realize that the Gods and
Goddesses are different and therefore minor things about each character and
class are different, however I have been involved with gaming for well over
20 years now.  I started playing the original 'Chainmail' game which sort of
morphed into Basic D&D, which then became AD&D.

I have playtested for TSR, Mayfair and several other game companies.  I was
also, for many years, a regular attendee of Gen Con in Wisconsin.  Bob
Salvatore and I exchange Christmas Cards and he has autographed most of my
Drow Series.

I really do feel that I am qualified to give the opinion that, were it not
for TSR and AD&D, we wouldn't have Everquest and the various other games of
this type.

In our family, we have certain members that are anal about things...  My
niece for example is the most anal Christmas person I've ever seen.  Her
tree has to be perfect, her lights just right, every decoration in it's
place.  We affectionately call her the Christmas Nazi.  You seem to be her
equivelent in this regard...  The Everquest Nazi.

There are going to be people who call their Dark Elves Drow.  Nothing is
wrong with that.  I don't believe that Varjay said anywhere in his post that
he expects other people to role play the Drow history or anything close to
that.  He just gets a kick out of it and there is nothing wrong with it.
Further more, Drow is much easier to type than Dark Elf and when conversing
with Newbies, the abbreviation DE makes them go "huh?".  You say Drow and
they immediately know what you're talking about.

Please realize that everyone has their own way of playing the game, and in
the grand scheme of things, it is only a game after all.  Take a breath and
med for a bit.  Then go rip the head off of a mob instead of someone trying
to post a generally harmless reply to this group.

Thank you...
