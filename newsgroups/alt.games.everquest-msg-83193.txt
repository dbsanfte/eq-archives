Actually, I think you're thinking of the one that sells snake SCALES, for
the level 5 or 9 shaman snake skin spell that requires the scales for a
component, he also sells bat wings, but I've never seen a vendor with any
kind of eggs in ANY of the 4 iksar newbie zones or Cabilis (and I pride
myself on vendor farming, so its not for lack of effort, my goal is to
someday use Zordak Ragefire as a vendor, lol)

Best source for eggs that I've found is Basilisks in Lavastorm, drop rate
for me was approx 1 egg / basilisk, some would drop 2, some none, it mostly
evened out, but these eggs go a LONG way, bake them up and you get 15 dough
/ egg.  Granted however that for us foraging classes all those feaking eggs
could be used to make dough, but I just end up force feeding them to keep
from eating my pickled wyvern.

One note about Basilisks in Lavastorm, they're about level 12ish, trivial
kills for anyone over 20, but if you're in the range to get exp from them,
do what you can to up magic resist, they proc a NASTY (for the level you'd
be fighting them at) stun/whirl spell that will pretty much lock you down
til you either die or get lucky on a resist and run like hell  (same kinda
thing happens with those fucking wormspore traps in Echo Caverns, except
with that you can at least heal yourself while waiting for the trap to break
or run you oom and kill you)
