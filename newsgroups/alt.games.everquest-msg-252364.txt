As I recall, the problem was even worse before, because you needed mobs 
you could kill on 50% of your HP; bandage back up and repeat, actually 
regenning hp was so slow as to be a joke.  Now it appears you have a 70% 
margin and that regen is so much better that you might well go to 80% 
regularly, or even more?

Cobalt Scar occurs to me, the wyverns are mainly melee although they 
occaisionally proc something or other; they were a favorite of my 
soloing cleric back in the day, and while soling druids and wizards are 
busy arguing over mobs its because they need four at a time, its very 
rare even on a busy day that there isn't -one- in reach whenever you 
want one.  OH, and there are a couple that you won't be able to single 
pull, but most are sitting all out on their own with no help nearby.

If you aren't KOS to the othmir, I'd pull to the beach where there's 
much less risk of adds from sloppy quadders or from the wandering 
drakes; I'd think a drake encounter would ruin your day since you're 
relying on buffs to add efficiency.  My cleric loved killing the drakes, 
they run so slow he could fear kite them even though he didnt have snare!

Its even easy to get to CS now, run into Mischief and go click on the 
secret tree exit, which dumps you in the middle of CS, then just swim 
out to the beach.  Getting out will be more of a challenge, its a long 
long run back to GD, a gate potion or OT hammer would probably be in order.

I had some trouble due to that "kill on 50%" thing.  I'd push the limits 
of what I could kill, and sometimes the mob would get lucky when we were 
both down to 5%, and manage to kill me before I'd kill him.  At that 
point, even SOWed I might have been too slow to get out of arms reach 
before death.  Depending on how high a margin of safety you insist on, 
you restrict your killable range even further, if I'm to run at 10% if 
things look risky, then that only left mobs that would do no more than 
40% of my hp per kill!  The bigger range of healability now available 
would make that a lot less troubling (only 60% [70%-10% margin]?  Why 
thats better than the range I had before when I'd go all the way down to 
death before running if things were close [50%])
