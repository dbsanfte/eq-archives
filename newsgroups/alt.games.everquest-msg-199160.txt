From Druid to Druid - go with 1HS until you don't melee anymore (somewhere
around mid 20's, if not sooner)

when you stop fighting, pick up something you can afford and that gives the
most wisdom in your hand...usually a blunt weapon (gem Encrusted Scepter,
Shissar Battlehammer....  At this point, throw some training points into 1hb
(you will mainly use it to kill GREENS that aggro you while medding - like
Orc Pawns or Skeletons in the Commons).

at level 50, I have a Zraxthril (sp?) forged Flamberge (10-25pp in bazaar)
in my backpack for such occasions (it's a 1HS weapon with +1 wis).  I sold
my blunt weapons, and now carry a book in one hand and the Paw of Opolla in
the other (neither are weapons).

the Druid Epic is a 1 Handed Slashing weapon, so.....
