I asked you "So what is your latency and who is your provider?".  If you
can't even answer those two questions then why should I believe you?  And as
I said before, just because you are using a dish does not mean that it goes
to a satellite.  I have been using a dish for about 6 months now.  It's
pointing at a hill about 2 miles away, NOT a satellite.  I believe that
satellite transmission has about a 1 second latency.  No way around it.

But if you really are on (good) satellite you could help out a lot of dialup
people by telling us who the provider is.  Many people can't get dsl in
their area.
