My son has a L15 Sorcerer, and he's coming to me asking about pets he can
have - not the pets for his home, but the "sidekick" or helper types.  He
says that some players have "crawlers" and "rumblers," and the like that
stay with the character all the time and can help the character in fights,
etc.  I've seen them in the game, too, but I'm not a heavy player, so,
although I've read the manual and looked online, I can't give him the
information he needs.
Can someone clear this up for us?

Thank you,

jm
