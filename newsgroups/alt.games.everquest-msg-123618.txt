AAAAHHHHH!!!!!!
I cast once, didn't work, cast again, didn't work, assume cure disease isn't
going to work so quit and get within 14 HP of death before someone heals
then cures me (no that I think of it, theirs did take 3 times too, I had
zoned by then though if that resets 3 count).

By the way, is it safe to duel someone to get rid of this?  Or is there too
much of a risk that if they don't over-kill you (hit for 30HP with you
having 10-15 HP, or something like that, basically hit for {DAMAGE > YOUR_HP
+ 10}) then you could die from it (they hit you for {DAMAGE =< YOUR_HP + 9}
and spell hits you for the remaining few)?

Or is there some code in how many HP you must lose in duel to cause death to
prevent this as an exploit?
