I found another locked door to work on.....the entrance to Paineel.

You'd think that Mr. Brainiac Bigshot (a.k.a. The Overlord), who plans on
taking over the world, would have spent a little more for his security
system for the entrance to his Secret Forbidden City.  As it is, my Rogue
only had the minimum skill in Pick Locks, and never failed at picking it.
Muahhahahahha!

By the time I was finished, I found I could also pick the lock to The Hole,
too.  :-)  I figure that's not bad for an 11th level Rogue.
