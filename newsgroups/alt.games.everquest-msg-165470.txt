You may want to try starting a more group-friendly class. I'm not saying
that druids aren't group-friendly - they can add a lot to a group - but
there are a lot of druids out there, and you're competing with all of them.

Who knows, maybe something different will rekindle your interest, if that's
what you want.

Clerics and enchanters usually don't have problems finding groups.
