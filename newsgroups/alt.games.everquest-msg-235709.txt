I doubt anyone would ever complain of free buffs (benificial spells you cast
on other players) or a heal tossed there way.
just becareful of doing this while a player is killing a creature, if they
die the mob (slang for creature) will come after you for healing them.
also if you heal them too much its gonna chase you. also faction, if your a
high elf and you see someone killing high elfs, its a bad idea to heal them,
if they win the fight your high elf buddys wont like you as much after.

clerics  are one of the easiest classes to get into a group, /lfg on and
/who all (5 levels give or take) so if your 20 then /who all 15 25 is a good
idea, then send tells asking if they have room, or to let u know when they
do,

usually in lower levels any time over 30 min is fine, and most low levels
leave without warning or replacement.
later on its a good idea to stay atleast an hour or 2, and to find someone
to replace you before you go.

ask in ooc what zone people would reccomend for your level,
