Absolutely not.  Any group I am in, I leave the corpses lying around, and
encourage others to clean it up.  I take my fair share, at most.  My shaman
runs into the same problem other casters do, but generally, the people I
group with are fair about it.  If a group I am in is not fair about it, I
don't group with them again.  I don't do a lot of pickup groups, I have a
circle of friends that I tend to group with.  When I am not grouping with
them, I often solo.
