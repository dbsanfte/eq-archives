I don't think I've ever heard that before. If there is a SOWer in the
group, I usually try to have it up all the time for a few reasons: if
I over-aggro (with wiz nukes is does sometimes happen, even if you're
careful) it makes it a lot easier to stay alive (yes, yes, given it is
one of those situations where it's better to run - most of the time
the MT likes it better if you stay put and let the thing beat on you).
Also, a wiz can usually not carry much, and is therefore mostly
perma-encumbered, and just needs the SOW to run at 'normal' speed.

There is a 3rd reason too since the patch before the LDON one, they
screwed up targeting somehow and sometimes I have to move around quite
a bit to get a lock on the right target when there are adds or
multi-pulls and /assist won't get the right target. The faster I can
get there, the faster I can start
casting/nuking/rooting/snaring/whatever.

Now I hope this practice hasn't gotten me labeled 'inexperienced
newbie'... and I don't think it has, but i guess YMMV.
