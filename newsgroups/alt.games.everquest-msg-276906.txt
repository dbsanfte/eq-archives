Okay, after wading through page after page of EQLive drivel, I can't find 
a straight answer... Can we /movelog to Stromm from a merged server or not?
Best answer I can glean from Station is "Stromm should be on the /movelog
list", but I can't even find a fucking list.  :)  Merging server list, yes.
Their message states we can /movelog to the server of our choice.  I've been
told that Stromm is not a server that we are allowed to choose, but can't 
find anything to back this up.

So, what is it?  The server of or choice, or the server of our choice
"kinda"?

Thanks for any info,

Faledan
