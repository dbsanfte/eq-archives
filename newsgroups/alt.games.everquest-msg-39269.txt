Funny thing is, I play in Europe and never really noticed the lag being any
more of a problem for me than it was for American Guildmates. I wonder if a
lot of the problems stem from really crappy British/Euro ISP's

Might be worth it for a new Char, but I doubt I would transfer to it.

Mind you it may just be a plot to purge the servers of our quiet old world
charm :)
