    Back when The Swarm was in the Karanas my cleric nailed the entire 80
plus of them in two Upheavals. Both times, the screen froze for a second
right after the spell went off, and I knocked a bard that watched the
carnage LD.

    For XP, yeah, they make me uncomfortable too. But when on a raid through
highly populated areas (like going to Royals in Chardok), standard procedure
is to pull a bunch of mobs at once and AoE the crap out of them. With that
many people to save you if you should get aggro, it's pretty safe and very
effective. Upheaval, the last PBAOE a cleric gets (and also a druid, no?)
does more damage per mob than a cleric's final single-target nuke.
