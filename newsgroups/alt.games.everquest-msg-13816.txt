Lokari is not a "common troll", nor any variety of troll.
That's not why you're not making any headway with her on this
point.  Here is why:

   "You cannot reason a person out of a position he did
   not reason himself into in the first place."
                               -- Jonathan Swift

[Speaking generally from here on out -- I'm as guilty
of this as anyone else, I'm not pointing fingers, just
trying to explain something to "Leather Goddess" about
newsgroup discussion dynamics.]

However, most people like to think that almost everything
they have come to believe, they arrived at logically.
So when someone comes along and starts logically dismantling
one of their not-so-well-founded beliefs, they often get
annoyed, not only because someone is disagreeing with them,
but because they're also being forced to re-examinine the
foundations (or lack thereof) of that particular belief,
and it can be uncomfortable to have to face that (especially
after having already staked out a position in a public
forum).  It's hard to re-evaluate and say "oops", so it's
often easier to rationalize, or flame, or accuse the other
person of being the illogical one, etc. etc.

But then someone said it better than I can:

   "I know that most men, including those at ease with
   problems of the greatest complexity, can seldom accept
   even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be
   such as would oblige them to admit the falsity of
   conclusions which they have delighted in explaining to
   colleagues, which they have proudly taught to others,
   and which they have woven, thread by thread, into
   the fabric of their lives."
         - Leo Nikolaevich Tolstoy (1828-1910)

Thus, having a public discussion on a point of contention
is often more like carefully defusing a bomb than it
is like solving a math problem.  Or at least it is if
your goal is to actually try to reach some sort of
common agreement.  And so you're not without blame in
this yourself -- your inflammatory attitude (e.g.,
"Lokari the LIAR!", etc.) is not exactly the brightest
behavior either, and is most likely to undercut whatever
good point(s) you may have been trying to get across,
not only with your target, but with the rest of your 
intended audience as well.
