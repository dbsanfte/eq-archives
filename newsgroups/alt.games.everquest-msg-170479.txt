Having practiced sense heading at every opportunity with my first-ever 
rogue, I kinda got used to being able to get a fast read of where I'm 
headed.  Then, started a new char and couldn't figure out why I kept 
getting a "don't know where the hell you're headed" message practicly 
every time I tried!  God, I felt stupid when I realized that this char 
had a SH of about 2, not my main's maxed-out (110 at the time) skill 
level!
