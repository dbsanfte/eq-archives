Some...   CoH and Guild Wars have *insane* pacing compared to EQ though. 
Don't expect anywhere near that level of interaction, even in the most
frenzied button pushing EQ has to offer.  You will find that EQ is more
dependent on thinking ahead to your next move and reacting to the fight
(unlike both of those, in EQ roots break, mezzes break, mobs live long
enough that you have to watch what's walking up on you as you whittle it
down, etc.).

I honestly have to say that both CoH and Guild Wars got combat pacing
"right".  But EQ is "good enough".  You just have to adjust to the
difference.
