Ill still say that the shackle quests are a nice thing to do. True, you 
need the Steel one to get better stats than Reinforced Acrylia, but the 
Steel one ARE nice, and i personally (and i guess lots of other people) 
like to do hard quests to get an item most people dont bother with. 
Doubt many ikky monks got the Shackle of Steel, im working on it now, 
and when i get it, i will treat it like my druids 7th shawl, a nodrop 
item thats rare, and required a great deal of work and patience to get.

Nice, didnt know we were KOS in Seru. Suit me fine, since i spend half 
of level 35 so far on killing guards in Marus Seru to get Katta faction 
and XP.

None of the items to get the sash and headband are nodrop, neither are 
the items themselves. I got my druid to collect the items to do sash 
quest, made a human monk mule to give the items, and got the sash.

Then got the items for the headbands with my druid (tracking NICE here) 
and warrior (try farming greenies in Blackburrow with a druid, forget 
it. A level 43 twink warrior are a LOT more effective down there. 
Althought the druids in Surefall arent that keen on trolls, hehe).
Got my monk mule from Freeport over, and turns out that at the 4th quest 
it ate the items, because i didnt have enough faction.
So made a Qeynos monk, gave in the start note to get initial faction, 
then got the items again, and after completing the quests with my new 
mule, i accidentially handed the headband to the quest NPC instead of 
the guildie helping me transfer.
So got the items AGAIN, and got them in my ikkys bank now just waiting 
for me to get to level 42 to go camp in SolB.

FoB and Kurns are brilliant. Even dragged my chanter over there to do 
the first levels.
