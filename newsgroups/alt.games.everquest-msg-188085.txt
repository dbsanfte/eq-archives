Nothing, I grouped with one a fair amount for a couple of levels. Then I 
had to take a break and he got too high for me to play with;-(

Lot of times there aren't any SKs around, at least in DL on Sol Ro. I 
play odd hours, starting about 0800 east coast us time, and have to play 
with whatever europeans are on at that time [or unemployed/student 
americans], and with the dedication of a couple more euro servers they 
are playing there instead of on sol ro. I will admit to havig 3 
characters on antonius bayle, but i only play there with my german game 
hubby when his wife wants to play also as her characters are all on AB.
