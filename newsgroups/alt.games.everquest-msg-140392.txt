    The Bazaar is paradise. I'm now up to five completed Twilight Seas
quests, none of which I would have done without it. My alts are getting
high-quality gear that I never knew existed for prices I cannot believe. 5
INT/CHA 25 HP/MANA neck, ENC-usable, 300 pp. AC 22 WIS 7 HP/MANA 50 shield,
SHM-usable, 3 K pp (it's 3 WIS away basically from the 10 K Bone-Braced
Buckler). AC 7 HP/MANA 35 CR 10 pants, INT-caster usable, 300 pp. My
guildmates have been able to buy upgrades to NToV drops in The Bazaar!

    Funny you should mention Coldain Skin Boots, though. On my server
Coldain Skin is a one-person monopoly. The trader, Veebee, has an alt
perma-camped in Icewell, Woofmeow. When the needed NPC pops, he camps in the
PC that kills him, kills him, does the quest, and passes off the completed
item to his Bazaar mule. At last count Veebee had over 3 million plat and
was the richest merchant on our server, all because he cornered the market
on two items.
