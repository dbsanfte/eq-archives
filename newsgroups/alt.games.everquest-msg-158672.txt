I'm not the most experienced grouper, but I can tell you what MY feelings
have always been.

In a Druid in a group, I feel it is my duty to die.  The times I've had
things fall apart and the RUN came across the /gs, I always stayed to see if
everyone got away, tossing last minute heals or roots.  I AM of course,
talking about the groups I've been in before I had an Evac, or ones I've
been in where nobody would listen to me when I asked what succor spell they
wanted or who was the one to call for the evac.

Not that I didn't have a succor mem'd, I've ALWAYS had a succor mem'd except
when I was too low level to cast them.  A poorly organized group however,
just splits up and runs instead of bunching around the Druid/Wizzie.  Once
they scatter, I can't succor them, so I've normally stuck around to fling a
root or a last heal in those cases.  I always figured I had SOW or wolf
form, so I could afford to risk death since I had a better chance of
outrunning the opponents once I'd tossed a few last spells around.

This however, is NOT the same for Clerics.  My feeling has always been that
on a major meltdown, THE CLERIC IS TO PROTECTED AT ALL COST!  Without the
cleric, recovering is much much tougher.  Everyone else is expendable when
it falls apart, but the cleric must survive.
