She'll never admit to it. To do so would be for her to face the chilling
realization that all her precautions are worthless the minute she links to the

Some people just cant face that I guess.




================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."

                   From "Travels with Charlie"
