Borked.  Badly.

You're going to be main healer?  Ditch any stuns and DDs, somebody else will
be doing that.  Load DA/DB.  When you drop a big heal on the MT with a few
untanked mobs standing around looking for somebody to hit, you'll be a tasty
target.  I'd probably keep a good group heal loaded too, to save the other
cleric in the group if the same thing happens to them.

I gotta say...   celestial elixir...  12k hp tank...   what an odd mix.   =)
Check if you have supernal elixir available.

Supernal light is good if you're well-equipped and/or have tons of AAs.  I'd
definitely suggest supernal remedy as an alternative (plus of huge range is
good for catching up to a MT who has gone out of range).

My pocket cleric's spell lineup would be:

Complete Heal
Divine Aura
Divine Barrier
Supernal Remedy
Supernal Elixir
Ethereal Elixir
Word of Replenishment
Whatever

I usually keep DI in last slot, but that's not gonna be needed in Fear.
