First was speaking to a guide... after a few hours got a tell from a GM...
and even petitioned on the "direct-contact" on the website. Website = not
even a response... GM = you have read it before...

Its not the item that hurts ... but what if you really lose some BIG loot ?
Maybe they had to do too much because of the concentrated problems... who
knows...
