Killed her well before PoP but obviously LONG after they made her much
easier.  Did everything pre-PoP outside AoW and Luclin ubers (none of
which we've killed post PoP either.)

Only one Tunare kill since PoP in fact.  Wiped a couple times to Ail
from memory although not every time.

I'm guessing July or August 2002 for first Tunare kill.  Most of the
summer 2002 was devoted to keying for ST and farming Primal that I do
know.

This would be true if the entire guild was level 65 with 200 AAs and
Vex Thal gear perhaps but that's far, far from the truth.  Personally
I don't believe straightforward CH chain type mobs to be all that
challenging unless they hit ludicrously hard.  Vyemm for example
causes us much more aggravation even after 20+ attempts on him; I
don't think we've killed him more than 1 in 3 attempts.

Grieg caused us WAY more hassle first time as well, first three
attempts that night were a sight to see, got him down less than 20%
each time with him pingponging around up and down those damn steps
like a Slinky on speed before we modified the healing strat and downed
him.  

I'm certain we could have killed AoW pre-PoP although perhaps not with
under 40 people and 0 deaths (allegedly).
