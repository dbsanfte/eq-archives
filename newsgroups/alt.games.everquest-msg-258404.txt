I wonder when or if online games are going to have a significant social
impact.

Thinking about my time in EQ, I've befriended Humans, Trolls, Ogres, Iksar,
and assorted Elves.  As the graphics improve in these games, the models are
more and more realistic.  With people used to seeing their friends on-screen
represented as such widely varying races, will it become much easier to see
real-life physical differences as not mattering?  Will a generation that has
played MMORPGs from a young age have less racial prejudice?

Similarly for gender and sexuality.

Another area where I wonder about the impact of online games is war.
Will it be much harder to convince young men to go off to places like Iraq
if they've grown up playing deathmatches, especially in war games like Medal
of Honor, or Battlefield: 1942?  Will they think..."hmmm, so they want me to
go over to Iraq and basically play Medal of Honor deathmatch with real guns,
and with no respawning, so unless I can get through the whole 'game' without
a single death, I lose?  Fuck this!  You want a war in Iraq, Mr. President?
Then go yourself!".
