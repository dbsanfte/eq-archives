Actually, IMO the mess we've got has more to do with the notions
of aggro-control and crowd-control than anything else.  The whole
single-tank model of combat, and it's highly annoying kissing
cousin the not-really-a-tank model of combat aka aggro kiting,
avoids placing significant gear requirements on non-melee group
members, most especially casters who don't even need to bother
getting a weapon or two.

I think you could actually make things a lot more fair between
the classes by reducing mana pools by 75% (or maybe 90%!) and
also limiting the duration of summoned pets to 60 minutes or so.
It would make grouping with melees far more attractive to caster
classes if they lacked the mana pool resilience that is part of
what allows them to solo so much more effectively than melees.
Meanwhile their "throughput", which is almost entirely tied to
mana regen, would remain strong.
