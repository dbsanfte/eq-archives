Here's what would help a lot: if alt would show buff names
when held down over the buff list, like it shows spell
names over that icon stack, and inventory names over
those stacks.

I'm tired of checking my buff status by right click and
hold over each icon, and the icons themselves are
very little help, since they have so little variety.


Also, I'd like to see a
/who GROUP
filter added, like /who GUILD

When I join a group, I have to either ask everyone
their class/level, or do a
/who Abel
/who Baker
/who Charlemange
/who Dextor
/who Evenalittlebitofsensewouldtellyouthisnameistoolong

I tend to mangle the spelling on at least two of the
worthies, and I'm frankly just tired of doing it after over
a hundred levels as a cleric.

How about targetted who?  That would be nice too,
/who %t.  Or heck, /who with no name should just
automatically do a who on whatever I have targetted.

Can you select party members by position in a social?

(GROUP)
/who f2
/who f3
/who f4
/who f5
/who f6

would make a handy hotkey if this is already in place,
but if its not, heck, might as well code /who GROUP
for me and save me the bother.
