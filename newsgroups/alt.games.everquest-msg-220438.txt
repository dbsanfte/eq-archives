IN all fairness, how much pivotal action can they invest in a guy who
spends all his time in med-lab?  A good doctor doesn't usually run around
after the bad guys, he's busy putting people together.  Since the plot of
B5 doesn't revolve around a medical epidemic (at least, I don't think
so...I'm unspoiled for seasons 4 and 5), I think it's fair he be less
dynamic.  He's no Doctor from ST: Voyager (that is my favorite sci-fi
doctor of all times...no question), but I have no complaints about the
character or his role in the story.
