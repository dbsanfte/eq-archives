LMAO, yes, it is my belief that the majority of those who play EQ
religiously the way I did have no life.  This I believe.  I played EQ for a
social outlet because I, too, had no life.  I used to enjoy interacting with
real people, not nyms and text on a screen, but the game itself sounded
interesting despite the detached way of interacting with people, so I
allowed myself to try it.

Why did I post personal stuff in the newsgroup?  Attention?  Yup.  Revenge?
Aw, maybe both.  If you've ever before felt used and then ignored, you may
just understand my need to vent and reach closure.

And as for revenge, I simply suggested a HI from the Lonely Guy if you spot
her.  I didn't suggest stalking, postal mail bombs, lewd tells, or anything
of the sort.

I know what I did was wrong, both sad and wrong, actually.  But what she did
was just as bad, if not worse, and I believe after talking with her those oh
so many times that she doesn't even realize it's wrong.

Good luck to the next dumb, lonely guy she preys on.  Maybe he'll tell her
that isn't his thang the way I should have.
