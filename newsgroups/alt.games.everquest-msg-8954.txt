Have you tried any other DX 3D accelerated games? If EQ is the ONLY
game affected, then you can narrow the problem down to EQ. If all 3D
DX games are hosed, then you are looking at a driver issue.

When you installed the Radeon did you do the following:

Set Display adapter to Standard VGA
Reboot
Delete ALL old video drivers. (Check add/remove programs for any
related apps)
Shutdown
Install new video card 
Load new driver when the video card is detected durring boot-up.

Here are a couple of links to excellent resources for the Radeon.
