As a ranger you have the camouflage spell.  Go to Kunark and get over to the
Field of Bone.  This is a great zone that will get you to 20 easily, and then
you can move to the the nearby Lake of Ill Omen.

My ranger went there at 15th, sneaking north through FV and across the Swamp of
No Hope.  And when I did it, melee types couldn't bind at that castle in FoB. 
And it was uphill, both ways!
