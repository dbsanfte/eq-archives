/agree
I did exactly two ports this weekend for people I did not know. One was
a guy in a hurry who offered (in South Karanas) 40 plat for a port to
GFey. I was getting ready to gate up to the moon to bank and restock
food and reagents anyway, so one more stop wasn't much of an
inconvenience, and forty plat is forty plat. I took him.  The other was
a high level chanter offering clarity for a port from Bazaar/Nexus to NK
when I was on my way back to NK anyway. Port... gate... whatever.
Clarity is the heroin of Wizards.
