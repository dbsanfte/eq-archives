Sure, it's easy, but please don't do this.

If you taunt as often as you should, you'll be spamming your group with a
pointless message.  If you don't taunt that often... well, then you should.

Now, a better idea is to set up a "speak and taunt" key which you use once
(per fight or so)... then switch to a taunt key that doesn't have the /say
line.

Set up a "social" that reads:

/say "Hey, %t, your mother is ugly, and your sister says she prefers bards!"
/doability 1


This assumes that ability 1 is taunt.  (On your ability pad, not your hotkey
pad).  If taunt is some other number, then the /doability line should be the
number of that taunt is.

(oh, and "%t" inserts the name of the mob or player that you have targeted.)

Uh, and if you didn't know how to set up a social... go to your "socials"
pad... click the arrow over to social pad #2, and right click a blank one.
A window will pop up that will allow you to enter 5 lines of commands (like
/say, /loc, /cast, /doability, etc...) and a spot to name the social.

Then hit "done."  To make it a hot key, click and hold the social you just
made until it becomes a button, then drop it in a hotkey slot (just like any
other button).

A full list of commands and variable names (%t, etc) for socials is in the
manual (everquest.doc or somesuch) in your EQ directory.
