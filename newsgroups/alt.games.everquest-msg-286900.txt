The only thing:  Every time you change characters on the account, the window 
comes up, covering nearly the whole screen, that you have to clear before 
proceeding.   This is same thing that happens if you have a map minimized: 
it too pops up, not minimized but covering the screen as well.  I do not 
want to do anything that completely removes the option for these as someday 
I will want to award these /claim to my characters.  But for now, it really 
is annoying.
