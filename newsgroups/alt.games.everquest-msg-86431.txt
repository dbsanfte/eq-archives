Piercing in primary hand always, you can not backstab unless you have a
pircing weapon in primary hand. Personally I don't fool around with procing
weapons much. They pull agro and make me a liabilty as a mana sink hole for
the healers. Work on your strength and AC some and you will see you dmg go
up and work on that BS its so slow to max out at higher levels.
One more thing are you using evade? It will get you out of some agro
situations...
