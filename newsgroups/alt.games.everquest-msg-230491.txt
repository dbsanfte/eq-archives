I am not really good at recommending gear to others, seeing as how several
of my pieces are still quite shoddy.  BA4 is a difficult focus effect to
obtain, in all honesty the easiest route is to get a mage bracer and have
someone duel you and leave it on a corpse when you log out.  Affliction
Efficiency can make a huge difference in mana consumption, and I would
recommend you look into getting a AE4 item as soon as you can.  As far as
droppable gear goes:

Neck: Iron Amulet of Unseen Horrors or Black Sapphire Velium Necklace
Face: Face Mask of Frozen Mana
Ear: Crashing Wave Earring
Legs: Pants of the Storms
Primary: Blood Bladed Dagger
Secondary: Tactician's Bulwark
Range: Ceramic Gavel of Justice or Sharp Claw Ahlspiess

My Magello is http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=518196 should
you desire to look at it.  Obviously there are several slots I could upgrade
from shopping around in the bazaar, but I have pretty much resigned to
waiting for raid drops to fill in the spots I need.  Both my wrists are
pretty poor, but I usually replace those with mage summoned items.

Good Luck!
