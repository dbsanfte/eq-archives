I've pickpocketed a lot of giants (Frost Giants in GD), but not ones that
other people are fighting.  In return, I get screamed at that I'm stealing
from the people who might sometime be fighting those giants.

Sorry, but if they're fighting the giant, then yes, the loot's theirs; if
they aren't, then the loot's mine if I'm willing to take the risk of having
a yellow mob beat me to death (solo Rogues without SoW do not generally win
against Frost Giants).

What they really need to do is put back into the game what used to be there,
namely a separate loot list for the pickpocketing.  This loot (including
some nice items) would only be accessible by picking the mob's pockets.
That way, having a Rogue in the group would provide added cash / gems / gear
over not having a Rogue.
