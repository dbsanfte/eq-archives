Ran into a rack of armor in Shar Val last night and got stuck.  Tried to log
and it told me I need to sit, tried to cast a spell and it told me I need to
stand, tried /rewind and it told me thats not a valid command.  Sit, stand,
log, gate, jump, petition, nothing worked except /q.  On the plus side that
did fix it and I did not get 1018.
