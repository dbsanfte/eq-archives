According to the wikipedia article
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment the company
"Silicon and Synapse" was founded in 1991 and did ship several console
games.  In 1994 the company was renamed "Blizzard Entertainment" and
shipped the first Warcraft game for the PC. 

So, imo, saying that Blizzard's success is due to the leadership of
"Silicon and Synapse" 20+ years ago in the console market is a bit of
a stretch.  But certainly an innovative explanation
