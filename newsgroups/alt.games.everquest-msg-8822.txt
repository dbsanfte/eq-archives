In addition to the ones others have mentioned, you need to
look at all the spells that don't cause damage that you can cast.
As a cleric, I frequently Fear mezzed mobs before the mez
is broken, for example.  This means that when mez does
break the mob just runs off instead of jumping the enchanter.

I also use my low level stun a lot in a heavy overpull, as it
does no damage, it won't break mez if the enchanter happens
to get that off and stuck before my spell goes off, but if the
mez fails, the mob will just stand there for a couple seconds
and allow the enchanter to cast mez again.  Cleric root is
good here too, doubles the chance that that thing we don't
want to deal with won't be getting to us.

Your strength debuff line is a good thing to hit mezed mobs
with, so that when you -do- have to engage the mob, it
hits less hard.  Same for slow and any other debuff you find
functional; since its just standing there, take your time and
turn it into a marshmallow before anyone does anything to
wake it up.

Mez, snare, slow, fear, DOT and you have a wimpy mob
walking away from you dieing without ever having had a
chance at killing you.
