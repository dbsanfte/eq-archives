No.   As of the moment the mob dies, the faction hit becomes permanent.

The only way it could be avoided is by not being on the hate list when it
dies.   Death will get you off the hate list.  So will zoning.  (and in a
certain way of looking at it... they're actually the same thing.  Death clears
the hate list by forcing you to zone.)

I think what Matt was saying essentially boils down to 'Don't buff anyone.' if
you go.    The Protectors of Growth have an aggro radius as big as the entire
zone.   If you throw a buff, and it happens to be 1 second after the
protectors spawn, you're on the hate list for the protectors.  Because they
immediately aggroed on the raid.   You will not be high enough to be attacked
over another target, but they will remember you when they die.

Also, dragging a corpse in that zone creates aggro.  Once again, since the
protectors have a zonewide radius, that will put you on the hate list if you
do it while they are up.   If you drag a corpse, do it invisible.  If the
protectors are up, or spawn soon after... gate out before they die just to be
safe.   You can bind yourself at the zone in and come right back in, but zone
for sure.  Zone a hundred times during the raid if you have to.  It's not like
someone will die because you're not there... you couldn't have healed them
anyways.
