  I'm afraid those are the places I hunted at level 15-20 with my
shadow knight. :\  At least when I couldn't find a group.  The Warrens
are good if you can find a group, though I don't know if you'll have
anywhere convenient to bank... you'll be KOS in Paineel and possibly
Erudin until you slay a number of kobolds.  Highpass is an option
(gnolls or orcs).  Maybe some of the weaker mobs in the Lake of Ill
Omen.  In a group, the Gorge of King Xorrb (Beholder's Maze).  Yard
trash in Unrest.

  Misty Storyswapper in North Karana (near the houses near the Qeynos
Hills zone) is a great static spawn for a 15-20ish character.  She can
be anywhere between level 14 and 18 if I recall correctly, but is
never really that tough for her level (pretty weak actually).  She
always drops a mandolin which can be sold for a platinum or more, plus
other standard drops for this level NPC.  Downside is that you wreck a
few factions if you kill her often enough (Antonican Bards, Guards of
Qeynos, Knights of Thunder).  I didn't bother with my SK character,
but I camped her with my necromancer with much success.

  Hope this helps.
