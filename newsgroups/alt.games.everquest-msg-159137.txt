Okay, so I didn't make th epoint directly enough.

Hmmm, actually seen that done a couple times, no idea why it didn't
come to mind.

My point was that CHeal works best when damage is focussed.  And I was
in more than one pickup group in DL (oh so long ago) that had 4 or 5
melees and a Cleric.  When the puller brought multiples, which wasn't
particularly rare, we would often have as many as three people tanking
at once after peeling the adds off the Cleric, who had to heal the lo
40s Warrior wearing Crafted (you know, back in the old days before
every Warrior was twinked with Engraved Velium at L10) early in the
fight.  Hmm, perhaps that's why there seem to be so many clueless
50-something players these days, they never have to play their class

in a high-stress combat until then.  For all the comments about three

zoners I've seen made here, it is also true that in the old days idiots
died early and often in the Dreadlands... which quickly separated the
true idiots from the merely ignorant (who improved)...
"natural selection at work".
