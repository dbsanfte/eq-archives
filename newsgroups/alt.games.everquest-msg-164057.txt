I'm sure that will get "tuned out" later, if they do. Most likely it's
not the gear as much as the tactics. Say what you will about FoH,
they've been breaking new ground and figuring shit out long before
anyone else for as long as they've been around. If tactics are the key
to winning the day as opposed to just raw firepower and defensive
armament, they're probably the "who ya gonna call" go to team.
