From the shadows, the mysterious David Navarro <david@alcaudon.com>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Other than any spell extending objects you might want to get, after
that, pretend you're a wizard and go for int first, hp second, ac
third. 

For anyone who still thinks charisma matters, mine wears kelp.
Charisma a whopping 49. In two days (about eight hours) of charm
soloing, I've had charm break early all of twice, and one of those
times was when it had been snapcasted without a tash on a white mob
after my original pet was killed. All the other times the charm lasted
long enough to kill at least three, and occasionally six or seven mobs
before the pet was low enough I had to put him to sleep.

There were times I killed a good five mobs, had the pet low health,
then failed hide five times in a row so the mob had regenned back to
fightable health, killed a couple more monsters, and then STILL had to
hide to break charm.

And not a single mez resist during that time.

Forget charisma.
