What makes twinking and powerlevelling inherently more enjoyable?

What makes you think level 70 is any more fun than 40? Indeed if 70 is 
more fun than 40, its probably because you didn't do anything 
interesting at 40 except try to get to 41, whereas at 70 you've finally 
stepped off the treadmill and looked around... (or maybe not... maybe 
you think you need 500AAs too before you can start having fun.)

If you actually play the game, play each level, and don't spoil it for 
yourself by rending everything at the level your at pointless by 
leveraging all your progression off higher level players (because THAT 
is what buying in the bazaar amounts to), you'd find that level 10 can 
be just as much fun as level 65.
