I believe you will need to either reinstall the basic software, (first disk,
or trillogy) or find a friend with the game and get them to let you cancel
the account on their machine.

You could try the phone, or putting a stop payment on your credit card for
the EQ billing, but the software install will likely be faster and easier,
really.
 There's even a way that would get you into the billing client without
having to patch, but I forget what it is...
