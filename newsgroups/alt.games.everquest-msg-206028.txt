That's not at cap, but it's certainly not horrible either.  I
suggest that you spend some time in the Bazaar (yeah, I know,
_not_ exiting) learning what tradeable gear is available, and
what the usual prices are.  If you filter by race, class, slot,
and AC (sort by AC) and look at the higher AC pieces to see
what they have for HP, WIS, MANA and resists, you can get a
pretty good idea of where you can get the biggest gains at the
smallest cost (in pp and mana pool).  If you do this a few
times you'll also have a chance to spot a bargain or two.  If
you're guilded there are gear drops and quest gear drops you
can be going after (Thurg quest armor, for instance, and Lance
mentioned the Cleric armor from PoG).  If you split your time
between xping, hunting cash loots, and hunting gear/quest bits,
with a little time spent hunting bargains in the Bazaar, you
should be able to hugely improve that 700 AC in just a few
weeks time.  There's not really a magic bullet, but a steady
effort should yield good results.
