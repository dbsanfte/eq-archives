Well  Akira is rather good, but very freaky. 
Robotech... me I loved it, but everyone has their own tastes
not sure what the 3rd one is you listed.

Their are alot of good Anime out there... there is also alot of
lame/bad anime as well.

I cannot remember the newsgroup, but there is one for discussing
Anime, just like we chat about EQ.

good luck.
