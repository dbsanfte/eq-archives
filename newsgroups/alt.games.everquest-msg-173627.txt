Hard cap for level 39 charm is level 51. That is of course unless
something has been broken/changed as of today. As a level 58 Bard have
yet to be able to charm anything past 51. And yes this sucks and yes
someone will say the old cliche "Jack of all trades..." and think it
makes sense and yes it changes drastically the way you solo at higher
levels. New bard charm is needed badly but dont even dream of it
happening cant upset the "Keepers of KEI" now can we. One advantage is
you can scap a lot of cha gear now in favor of something useful like
coffins.
