A different thread inspired this post, I think it could be interesting.

What does it take to make your ignore list?

I have two classifications, temporary ignore and perma-ignore.  Temporary
ignore for me is anyone I can't remember a week later why I ignored them.
This is usually casinos, people asking to buy my toons, beggars, people who
start cussing at me when I won't run 3 zones to give them KEI, etc.  I
usually clear these out about once a week.

Perma-ignore for me is about two dozen people that I KNOW why I ignore them:

An ex-guildleader and her husband who were abusive beyond the pale ("If
break mezz and get the enchanter killed, I'll kill you myself and not ress
you!")

A two-faced rogue who is nice to your face then starts whisper campaigns
behind your back.

A cleric with a serious persecution complex.

Another cleric who deliberately trained someone else's raid so our guild
would have more  people in zone so we could get to a mob first - it was
going to take another fifteen minutes for our guild to gather, the other
guild was gathered and buffing.

A ranger who was such a glory hound (and ignored the cleric's pleading to
stop pulling for a medd break) that he killed off half the party multiple
times (HE didn't need healing, so what if the tank is at 20 health, why
shouldn't he pull?)

A druid who repeatedly told me to just stand next to the cleric and play
manasong (on my bard) and threatened to kick me out of the group for
meleeing.  I left on my own, thank you.

So - not naming names, what does it take to get on YOUR ignore list?
