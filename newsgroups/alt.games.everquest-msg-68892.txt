This one is no drop. But mages still need it for their epic, and it's a rare
drop from a zone-wandering uncommon/rare spawn. There will always be hefty
pricetags for looting rights on these.

Are there many perm enduring breath items in SoL then? Don't think I've seen
any yet.

Velious stuff already made this one less appealling (ie Phenocryst's quest
has a better item), but it's still one sweet item, especially for twinks.
