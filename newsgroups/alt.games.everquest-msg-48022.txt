Verant, in its infinite wisdom has nerfed the
Kelethin bard's letter quest. This has made the
playing of the game significantly less fun for
me. It sounds stupid, but the letter quest from
Felwithe to Kelethin is one of the few good ways
to earn coin early in the game. And with Greater
Faydark flooded with level 1's, suitable prey is
hard to come by.

Verant's vision has been and remains: No matter
how high you level and no matter what you may
wish to do, you will have to kill rats, bats and
snakes.

I have rarely been so excited and I have rarely
been so disappointed by a game change.

To Verant: You owe me 1-12 gold pieces. Until I
get them, bite me
