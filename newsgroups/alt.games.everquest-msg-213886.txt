Look, you and several others are kind of "151 wisdom is better then 150
wisdom" nit pickers. You try to hold onto a insignificant .7% <or should I
say .666 to keep you happy> difference because you can associate a number to
a something.

What is worse is when you are wrong, you immediately go to insults. I can
always tell when I have won an argument in this newsgroup when I start
hearing the antisocial retards respond with insults instead of facts.

Let me illustrate this with an example: If someone had a snare that lasts 2
hours you would would say it is the best snare in the game. That fights
don't last 2 hours is completely irrelevent in your world of more has to be
better. In this game more often just means pointless. That is exactly the
case with using a 14 minute snare in a group.

Some of your<meaning the 'hey we are losing so let's switch to insults"
crowd> game view is pathetic. I mean suggesting things like snare is better
then darkness because it doesn't break mez. It assumes you have a necro
retarded enough to cast it on a mezzed mob in the first place or not using
assist. I mean really, just tell the necro not to cast on mezzed mobs and
use /assist. Kind of a waste of my time trying to educate you with details.

It is pathetic in the quickness to insult and here is why: In rush to switch
to insult mode you come up with crap senarios that never happen in the game
to get to the insult stage.  It destroys the illusion you know play the game
or have actually grouped yourself.
