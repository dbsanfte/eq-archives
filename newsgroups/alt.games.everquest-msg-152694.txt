Don't take this as a flame, but did you read the actual question (I'm only
guessing not because there is no refferene to the question asked in the
first sentence, & the software you're telling me about would defeat the
ability I'm trying to cause)?  I'm NOT interested in being able to run EQ
outside of it's current format.  What I'm interested in is using other
software or methods to cause EQ to close.
