Damn I have much hate for this change!

Getting GoD spells has been a pretty retarded affair since the start, even
after the so called "drop rate boost" its a rare, slow and tedious process.

Restarting missions until a named was spawned / near the zonein has been the
only way to have a hope in hell of a spell (and after weeks and weeks of
doing this, and still having a lot of people lack a certain spell)

Its really fucking stupid to have the spells only drop in 1 "level" area,
ultra rare, to force people who have advanced beyond the content to spend
another month farming named with fingers crossed, for the spell to drop.

MAKE HOLY LIGHT DROP GOD DAMN YOU
