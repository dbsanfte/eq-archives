Well Lowky, I think you are doing pretty good.

I have to be honest and say that Orlun is a first character and has had to
earn the gear he wears himself.

That being said, He made a good amount of plat in the early twenties and
bought and killed to get full set of Ravenscale like you.  Ravenscale has
comparable stats and AC to Ry'goor for those of you who arn't familier with
it.  Another plus to RS is that it is Rogue only so it is much cheaper than
Ry'goor. I picked up my RS for 150pp a piece and 900pp for the breastplate.
I always see peeps auc WTB ravenscale, so I should have no problem selling
it someday if no guildies need it.

I have to admit that I haven't changed a bit of armor since then and even
now at level 50, I am still wearing the RS. I have aquired some resist gear
for raiding but I normally can be found in the black garb.  I am now finally
getting up high enough to start hunting in Sebilis and KC and hope to start
replacing the RS with Myrkolar...(or however the hell you spell that too
many consonant armor) and other gear soon.  With the proper twinking funds,
I would have bought the Myrk at an early age as I see so many rogue twinks
have done.   I still haven't got any haste gear but... I don't think its
necessary for the pre-fifty levels as much as some people think.  I could
see it if you wanted to solo, but I doubt I would be able to evade argo if I
hit any faster. So, in short, you are fine for armor.

This is a link to a GREAT rogue information site.  It list the top 20 or so
pieces of armor in each slot and the best weopons for a rogue to get.
Sadly, only a few of my Items even make the list but it's a good look into
what uber gear is coming down the pike

http://www.deadzed.com/eq/class/rogue.htm

I see that the site also has guides for other classes but I havent
personally checked them out.

As far as weapons, I did the Burning Rapier quest at levels 23-25 and ended
up with that nice little gem,  If you are a rogue, DO THE QUEST!   It is a
blast.  Most say it is a mini-epic and the Burning Rapier is a nice weapon
to use in the offhand for the pre- 50's levels.  Stats are 7dmg, 20 delay,
proc 37dd "ignite".  I can usually get in 4-5 procs per mob for an
additional 200 damage.

My main weapon was my DREAM WEAPON as a young rogue.  At around level 26, I
had saved my plat and went to Faymart to by a slime coated harpoon like you
use.  I bought one for 900 plat and returned happily to Antonica to try out.
As I was passing through EC, I saw an AUC for "WTS trak tooth".   I sent the
guy a tell saying that that was my dream weapon and that some day I would
love to have one.  He replied..."make me an offer"  Jokingly I answered
"2000 plat and a Slime coated harpoon".  "Sure" was the reply to that.  I
tripped over myself running to the bank to get the plat (all I had) and made
the lucky deal.

So my main is a Trak Tooth (10 dmg and 20 delay).  This sells for around 5-8
k on xev.

If you have the money, I would recommend it.  There are about 5-10 other
piercers in this range as well, but the trak tooth is Rogue only, so is
cheaper than some.

Summary..
With the 10dmg 20 delay trak tooth, I have been getting up to 160-200 dmg
backstabs from level 37 to 50 and with that and the 7dmg 20 delay offhand BR
my total damage can average around 80 -120 points a SECOND after double
hits, dual wields and a few procs and backstabs.  I find that with
partnering with Jakugg (50 warrior). I have to evade CONSTANTLY (every 8
seconds) to keep argo on the taunting tank.  I still get argo'd once in
awhile do to evade failure and BS successes and have to back off for a few
seconds.  With 2 tanks, I can pass on evading for 10 to 20 seconds at a
time.

I'm sure fully twinked rogues can do better but... unless it comes to the
post 50 mobs, I seem to do enough damage with what I have.

My two coppers...

Orlun, 50 Rogue, Xev
