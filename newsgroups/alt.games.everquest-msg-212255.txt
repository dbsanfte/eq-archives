It would appear from what I'm hearing that the dungeons are being
designed from that standpoint anyway, regardless of player preference. A
time limit to achieve whatever goal is set for the dungeon doesn't lend
itself to a good dungeon crawl, IMO anyway. More like a frantic race to
complete whatever task is set (kill boss, recover some number of items
are the 2 I heard so far) People are theorizing that SOE is doing this
because they're designing the system to support 10k instanced dungeons
total, so they don't want people wasting any time in thier private
dungeons.
