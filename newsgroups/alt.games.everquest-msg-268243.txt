Hit 'K' for Knoweldge book and hit Spells tab. There you'll see a new icon 
has shown up for Eidolic Ward. Put this lifesaver in a very visible spot, it 
will save your ass often. It's a Ward that takes no power and no time to 
cast, but has a long recast timer on it. Great addition to your toolbox.
