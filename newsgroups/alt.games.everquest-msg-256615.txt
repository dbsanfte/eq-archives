They might have changed them since I last played there (which was a
while ago) but it used to be with the Misty wall guards, if a player
trained a mob to the guards and they killed it, then at least one of
the guards would then spend the next five minutes running around
between the wall and Runnyeye zone KSing everything in site before
going back to his post at the wall.

Yeah, I know about Field of Bone and I think some of the Nektulos
Forest guards like to roam and KS also.  Wasn't aware of this Ferin
guy--he certainly does sound like a nuisance!
