You said the encounter couldn't be balanced because a whole guild
could come along and zerg an encounter. I just pointed out this is
possible *now*, and certainly isn't any sort of problem. You moved the
goalposts from zerging to bottomfeeding, make up your mind.

Occasional bottomfeeding is a natural but normally rare or unobtrusive
result (depending on the target) of playing with other people. When
other people are around there is always going to be the possibility of
griefing. But its *still* better than not letting the other people
play with you.

Don't tell me the whole point of this is that you want to get away
from the evil ubers taking your spawns....

That's also not what you were referring to when you were talking about
"balance". But okay, let's address this issue instead. Your beef is
with bottomfeeding rather than balance. I guess with instances you
could make it so no one could go into a dungeon without it being
tailored to their level, eliminating bottomfeeding. Do we just ignore
that such a situation is completely absurd in a worldy sense? How
about that it reduces everything to the level of a Diablo 2esque
treasure hunt? I prefer the bottomfeeders to a mindless loot grind.

And this is bad... why again?

Seems you've decided that since you want to turn the mmorpg into a
single group game you don't like it if anyone else plays it
differently. Unfair or something.

I'll tell you something now. This idea of "tailored encounters" and
what "twice as many as it should need" is complete horsecrap. You
should be able to take whatever the fuck you want against whatever the
fuck you want, technical (lag) issues aside. And your target shouldn't
be tailored to YOUR level. I am quite sick of this handholding
attitude in newer mmorpgs and expansions. If people are looking for
epic experiences maybe they should look where it actually is rather
than try to force it where it isn't. When our guild, without a single
elemental player or piece of equipment, beat Rallos Zek for the first
time, that was fucking epic. A pile of L46s going to the same place
and getting a L46 range Rallos Zek to fight because their instance
tailors itself to them isn't epic, its *stupid*.

You know what that reminds me of? Racing games where the other cars
would speed up and slow down according to how well you are doing. It
was the dumbest, the worst way to make a game in the world. What kind
of accomplishment is it to beat people who will slow down to let you
come back? How much fun was it to run a near perfect race only to lose
because miraculously the AI cars didn't follow the same rules so they
could come back?

It appears the problem isn't with the zones or noninstancing but with
the loot focus of the players you are referring to.

I'll give you this - maybe instancing would make a better game for the
dedicated loot gobblers. The ones who see a spreadsheet when they
bring up their stats and inventory, not a character. Then they can get
all decked out in their fancy gear and show off in the graphical chat
room - er, PoK - without having to worry about interacting with anyone
else anywhere else. But that's not what I want to play and I think
there's better alternatives.
