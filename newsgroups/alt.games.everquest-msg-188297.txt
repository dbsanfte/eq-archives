Hmm.. thats a difficult question to answer, the characters are at very
different levels of the game, and there is a very different shift in power
as characters reach different levels.

A level 60 warrior (relying in taunt), and a level 60 warrior (relying on an
EB weapon) will have very different views on the game, at both raid and
group level.

A shaman with and without canni 5 will also have a different view on mana
regen (from tedious, to "fine"), and as I've recently discovered, the aa
knockback/root skill can mean the difference between life and death.
Something that resisted slow (and then started smacking my shaman for 500 a
hit, plus a 300 proc) could mean a wipe if the shaman died.  Now he's
totally self-sufficient...

Also my monk outdamages my rogue (by like 3 to 1), but thats down to
gear/weapons (and 200 more AA)

I group with a guildie 65 mage, and I see how much they own...  I play my 55
mage, and see how pathetically weak he is (or i just suck, huh?).  Mages got
it rough 50-60 imo, but 61+ they got some awesome upgrades

Or I log my wizzy on, and nuke for 1k... log a guildie wizard on, and can
crit for over 5,000 damage

Ultimataly gear (and spells), level, and AA's seem to make more difference
for me, than any class balance/inbalance (my 65 monk tanks better than the
62 warr, but I have 1k more HP, 200 more AC, PoP advanced defensive aa's....
I know an equal aa/gear warr would put me to shame)
