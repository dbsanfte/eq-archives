Well they don't need a law.  At several levels every play you make on a
table is being monitored.  Starting with the dealer, then the pit crew
and then the eye in the sky, every hand and every bet is watched.  If
they feel that your method of play is going to lose them money in the
long run you may be asked to leave.  They will likely not explain any
reason for it, just calmly, but forcefully ask you to leave and not come
back.

When I go to Vegas I don't dress the part of a "player" but inevitably I
find the pit guy with the fancy suit paying close attention to my
plays.  My betting style quickly gives me away as someone who knows what
I am doing and thats not an issue.  It is a sign to them to watch what
I'm doing because I might be doing something that will be an issue for
them.  Once they watch for a while and see the betting pattern is not
based on card counting they become much more friendly, but for those
minutes before they figure out what I'm doing the cold stares are brutal
hehe.
