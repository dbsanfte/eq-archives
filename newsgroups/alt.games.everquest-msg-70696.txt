You're pretty ignorant about Windows if the above is true.  I've never
worked for Microsoft and even I know that all you have to do is delete these
files:

C:\windows\win.com
C:\windows\command.com, c:\command.com, c:\windows\command\command.com
C:\io.sys
C:\msdos.sys

The last two require an "attrib -r -s -h" command first.

This is all you have to do to install an OEM version of Windows 9x, because
these are the files that are looked for to see if you have a previous
version of Windosws.
