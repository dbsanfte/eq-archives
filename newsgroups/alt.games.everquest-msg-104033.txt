Verant has an old engine, hacked to try to keep up.  Funcom has a new engine.
So, it is not surprising that it looks and performs better.  That's also why
DAoC's engine looks and performs better than EQs.

Also, is Funcom using their own engine, or did they license one?  Verant is
using their own.  Mythic licensed one from NetImerse.  I'd expect licensed
engines to have a look and performance advantage, simply because the company
that develops the engine keeps working on it.  A company with an in-house
engine probably doesn't devote as much effort to engine improvements over the
years as a company that is in the business of licensing their engine to new
developers.
