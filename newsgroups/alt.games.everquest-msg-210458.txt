I'd love to see her reasoning on this.  It's not worth even the
2 day raid in sky, much less all the other massive time sinks in
the quest.

Epic - level 49, 4300 hp, 50pt innate DS, max hit 83.  70ish 
DPS from melee, and a huge chunk (estimated at 20dps) from
spells.  Not immune to fear, can't land any procs on mobs that
are 60+.  

Servant of Marr - Level 60, 3300hp, 90ish DPS from melee alone
+cold nuke, +sword procs.  Immune to fear, enrages <10% health,
procs land on most everything.

Ward of Xegony - Level 60, 3800hp, 70ish DPS from melee alone
+stun, +sword procs.  Immune to fear, enrages <10% health, procs
land on most everything.  45pt DS from Flameshield of Ro.

on anything above low 50's the air pet better, the water pet dishes 
out more damage.

All my old-guild's rangers had Swiftwind by 55 or 56, earthcaller was
another matter.
