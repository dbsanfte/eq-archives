Hmmm... Well, if you truly have an alliance then it shouldn't be too
difficult to get one of your allies to talk to the guy. Admittedly, he sounds
like a dork. On the other hand, the newts who post things like "Screw
alliances or the threat of Evil. I'll kill Goods wherever I see them and
have fun doing it" are just as dorky. Until there's some sort of unified
leadership among the teams, any alliances between individual guilds
are not going to amount to much.

Frankly, if I was a Neutral who as fed up with it as you seem to be,
I'd turn the tables on him. As a previous poster mentioned, what he's
done is to work his faction up to Ally with the guards so that they
help him in fights. You could either do the same thing, so that they
wouldn't help, or you could go the opposite direction. Work your
faction up with the Corrupt Guards and/or Kane Bayle, then try
to lure him into a place where YOUR guard allies can get him.
