The problem with Open Source games as opposed to Open Source 
applications is that there is a much higher degree of subjectivity when 
it comes to games... there is no obvious "right thing". If The Gimp sets 
itself the goal of cloning Photoshop, it has a good chance to achieve it. 
If then it wants to expand on Photoshop adding features that are 
obviously good, then it probably could, because it's not *that* 
difficult to tell a good feature from a bad feature.

On the other hand, one only needs to read this NG for about a week to 
realize that it's pretty far from obvious what is a good or a bad 
gameplay decision in a MMORPG. While technically the Open Source 
community could create an infrastructure to rival EQ if it put its 
collective mind to it, the design documents would be, by necessity, the 
product of single people or tiny teams, and while everybody is very 
happy about putting in the hours working on *their* game, the enthusiasm 
wouldn't be there when it comes to implementing someone else's vision, 
however charismatic that leader is.
