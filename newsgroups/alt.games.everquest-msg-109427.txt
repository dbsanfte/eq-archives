OK, here's a question ...

I know about the Janum and Rebby quests, and I know my way around the
sewers, but atm I'm KOS to the Freeport Militia.

The reason I'm KOS is I've been doing the damaged militia helm quest.

The reason I've been doing the damaged militia helm quest is to raise my
Steel Warrior faction.

The reason I'm trying to raise Steel Warrior faction is because I want to do
the Qeynos Investigator badge quest.

For those who don't know, I have to enter the warrior guild in Qeynos for
part of the invest. badge quest. I'm currently threatening to Steel
Warriors, all I want is to get to dubious. Every other quest that raises
Steel Warriors either starts in the warrior guild, or in Halas (barbs don't
like me either). I know I can fix militia faction later, but is there an
easier way to raise Steel Warrior faction?
