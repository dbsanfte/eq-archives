I dunno, why can't they give druids some ports on Luclin like Wizards
get?  Or at least let Druids port to the PoA and Hate?

Druids get *ONE* unique port, and that's only to our guild in
Surefall.  Very useful, yeah, but hardly unbalancing.

Well, howabout Enchanters that have to research their AE Mez spells
and Slow.  Or the quest for Tashania.  And what about Necro's and
Mages that got to research their pet spells?

Wizards aren't the only ones with difficult to get spells.

>c) Whats up with all those Magnify spells? Whats the deal with getting Sight

So, you get some useless spells.  All classes get those.  Alls fair.

CT gate was NEVER safe at 24.  From what I understand now, it's still
possible to gate into CT as that there are no wanders around the port
in.  Just gate into CT and evac to the entrance.  All's good.

>e) Root at 4th level, or Enstill at 20th level? Like most of us wizards have

From what I understand, Enstill has a greater possible duration than
Root.  How well it actually works, I dunno.  Might have a bug to
submit.

Like ports.

Be careful what you ask for.

And only be able to nuke half as well.  You can nuke WAY better than
any other class, along with being the best port class by a longshot
(Translocate Spells Rock!).  In the end game Wizards are RIDICULOUSLY
powerful, where a class like druids tends to fall behind.  

They have done LOTS for wizards recently.  Bane nukes, aggro reducer
nukes, critical nukes, ManaBurn, Translocate spells.  Wizards get a
LOT of really cool spells and abilities.  Wizards are plenty balanced
as it is.
