Sure, the hypothesis seems ridiculous.  But how is it racism by another
name?  Allen Bouchard mentioned that the linguist focused on Mandarin
Chineese.  He did not mention that the linguist had drawn the same
conclusion regarding Cantoneese.  So if it was supposed to be racism, would
you mind telling us what race it was singling out, as it could not have been
the Chineese.
