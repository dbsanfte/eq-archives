SWG has a small advantage over EQ in that they have the incredible
amount of source material in the continuity to draw on - at the
same time in their life cycle I'd expect SWG to have more content
than EQ  (IE compare SWG at launch to EQ at launch)

Thing to remember is that there are seriously dimishing returns as you
put more assets into a single project.  SOE and LucasArts are large 
enough to easily have two full developement teams working on the 2 
products.
