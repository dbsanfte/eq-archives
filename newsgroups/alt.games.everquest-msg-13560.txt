In what way am I rude?  I don't even say a word to them except to ask if
they are looking for something.  If someone says something like "I was
curious about what you were wearing" I would tell them that I think they
should ask permission before inspecting.  Their response (or non-response)
is then indicative.

The point is that it is not true that there are no repercussions in the game
for being rude.  It affects your reputation.  I have no problem building a
reputation as a person who values politeness.  I have buffed and ressed
plenty of people and have no trouble finding SoWs.  The relatively few who
are on my list do not affect my play in any significant way.
