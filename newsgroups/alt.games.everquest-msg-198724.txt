Level 35 and you're still fighting?  Wow.  That's hardcore.  :-)

Seriously, you should really stop fighting monsters.  Your time will
be much better spent sitting down to recover mana.

At level 35, hmm... that's kind of an in-between range for most of
the areas I'm familiar with.  Too high for Highkeep goblins, too low
for Dreadlands.  Perhaps Lavastorm, Guk, Overthere, or Solusek's Eye?
