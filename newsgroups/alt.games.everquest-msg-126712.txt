Got TBoots last night.  Yep, as the thread replies said,
turns out I can activate them on the fly.

I can also be running on selos, turn off all songs, click
boots, watch the timer, and kill selos just before
TBoots finish cast.  Or start singing selos, watch the
timer, and kill TBoots just before selo's finish cast.
Either way there is a slight slow down to normal run
speed just before the new speed kicks in.

Since there's no mana or even pause involved in either
Selo's or TBoot, I can do this back and forth at will,
Selos to go find  a target, TBoots while pulling back,
TBoots while kiting, Selos when it goes bad and time
to run to zone.  As a bonus, TBoot speed is a -lot- better
for pulling (no more losing the mobs on the way back)
and kiting (much easier to keep them in kite range when
moving just a little faster than them)

Frankly TBoots are already looking like an indispensible
part of bardic equipment, much as JBoots are indispensible
to the working wizzard.
