Yepp, EMarr here too, all 12 of me toons (In TBS accent).  You know I
may get to see TBS someday.  Still trying to catch up (and never will
I guess, being non raid guilded and such).  There is a ton of content
now and I'm happy messing in TSS or old world zones.

Just got my first toon to 75 the other day.  Been working him for 7
years.
