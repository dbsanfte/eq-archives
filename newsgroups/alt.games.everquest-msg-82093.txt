Oh my, someone else whose memory retreats! :) Yes, David let me know what
the name of it was or it would have made me nuts! It was a really good book,
if you still have it around and your EQ life isn't as consuming as mine ;),
try reading it. Well, I liked it because there was so much strength in that
little girl. I don't get off on sappy stuff, and that book was not sappy,
but it WAS one that made me want to cry (I didn't). Oh hell, who am I
kidding, LoTR still makes me cry after 13 times! ;)
