You might want to go back and try him again.  I've found them pretty
easy actually, at least by the mid-50s.  Helping a guild warrior get
whatever piece they drop for the epic was a great way to get exp to
power through 54.  Kill all the Ice Giants, drop into the pit and get
the silly mad exp down there, catch the giant respawn, repeat.
We generally did a three-man group, warrior, cleric, bard, with a
druid who would join in sometimes in the pit.  Most of the giants were
blue to me at 54-55, but the warrior was about 57 and one or two were
exp-giving green.  At your level you should be able to deal with
single giants pretty well now, though a haster/slower would help
hugely.  Once Tiru gets a feel for when to drop the CHeal, you'll find
they don't eat too much mana either.  
The best group battle of my EQ life started with the druid falling
into the pit, then hitting gate rather than succor.  Found himself at
the Seb orb as we pulled a priest, 2 regular giants, and 2 icy
terrors.  Luckily I had dinged 55 about an hour before, which meant I
had my upgraded manasong, which is twistable.  We almost died early
on, but I was able to get the icy terrors and their evil, nasty,
cheating knockback positioned around the corner, all 3 giants in the
Vox lair entryway, the cleric sitting just outside the rock, and the
warrior in with the giants.  I would run into the lair, charm first
icy, sic it on second icy, let them blast each other and me (safe fall
saved me literally thousands of points of damage that fight, possibly
10s of thousands), run back into entry, one pulse of haste, one pulse
of manasong, repeat.  It took almost 25 minutes, and for at least the
last 10 the cleric was just medding to get the next cheal off and
praying, but we did emerge victorious.  We almost died at the very end
when the last icy terror broke snare, ran, and almost caused it to
fall into the pit, but we remembered that trick right at the last
second.  Hmmm, I'm wondering if the pit still gives good exp, might be
time for a break from the Chardok, Seb, Velks Lab exp grind.
