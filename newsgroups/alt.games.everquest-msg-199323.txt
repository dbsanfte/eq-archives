OK.

So, my wife is now trying to play EQ. Her system isn't
top-of-the-line, but it ought to be good enough. We have "show PC
names" and "show NPC names" on, but, she can't see them, except under
very unusual circumstances...the names show up if they're against a
totally black background. Against anything else, they're clipped off.

I've played with clipping plane depth, etc, but nothing seems to work.

Any suggestions?
