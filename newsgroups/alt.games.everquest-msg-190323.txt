    Actually if you're within eyeshot of me it will get you immediate
assistance. If I can't see you it will usually result in /shout where are
you?

    Well, sometimes if you're being smashed to pieces by a mob you dont have
time to give a lot of detail, but if you've got a vague idea of where you
are its GREAT to include that info at least. Heroic saviors will rush to
your aid :)
