I know that about 3 months ago I did intervene in a duel in the
tunnel, by healing the one guy, and I did thus change the outcome of
the duel, because the seeming winner had before won a duel
when he had before promised to not kill the duellant and did
 it nonetheless...
That pissed me seriously off and I enjoyed seeing his head smacking
into the stonefloor when he finally died, honorless...

That's something to brighten your day,
