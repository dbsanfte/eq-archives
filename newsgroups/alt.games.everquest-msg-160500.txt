I must say that since PoP came out the number of people in HHK has come
down.
Also the 50+ are thining down. My, now 18, cleric will see if he can find a
group.
So far I worked up my pally from 24-35 very fast and my druid from 32-35.
Never had to wait really long tho but then I again it helps to be in Europe.
