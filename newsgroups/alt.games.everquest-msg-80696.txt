My favourite is "I'll give you 5pp if you can make me laugh."

I can have a notoriously cranky sense of humour sometimes. ;-)

Actually, a few days ago someone demanded a weapon from me cause I was
high level. I was waiting for a friend and spent the next 25 minutes
harassing him for his rusty sword, complaining he was higher level than
me, that me looking like an epicced plate wearing level 58 was a bug,
that the damn GM's wouldnt help me out, and he was a selfish git for
not giving me his stuff when I so obviously needed it.

After about 15 minutes he got the point. Took him a looooong time though.

Then he went on ignore.
