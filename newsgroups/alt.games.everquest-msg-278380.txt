And an "EQ emulator" could be used with a different client (granted, one
that's not been written, but not anything outside the realm of possibility). 
The *fact* that many people who use dosemu use it with "dos" negates the
argument that it "can be" used without involving a Microsoft product.

Interesting...  and do you know why Intel couldn't go after AMD?

Because reverse engineering is *legal*.   =P

Ironically, Intel is now the one reverse engineering AMD chips.

You seem very confused.  How do you think the EQ emulator was created?  By
using what was "freely observable in the wild".  I.E., reverse engineering
the network stream, then building a server that duplicated what they
observed.
