Clear the Decks - a book well worth reading.  Loaned out my copy, and
can't find it anymore.

Soloing a mage in the 40's was the same - 3 or so 30-45 second fights
followed by reading for 5-7minutes while he medded to full.

Soloing at that level was all about short, sharp and brutal fights.

A fire pet doesn't tank long - you time your nukes in and pray to
the resist gods - if one resists you have to immediately recast, and
aggro is almost assured.
