I guess my question was where do I go if I'm not happy with the
results I'm getting by sending the petitions.

I haven't seen a GM on my server since the last patches and I check at
least every half hour I'm on. I wouldn't be rude or disrespectful to
anyone but I don't really care if a GM gets upset because I sent him a
tell.

I'm the customer. They are getting almost 40 bucks a month from me for
my 3 accounts. A GM works for the company that is getting my money.
They provide a service that I pay for and have the right to expect
problems that can be solved to be fixed in a timely manner. I'll stop
venting now and go submit another petition :)
