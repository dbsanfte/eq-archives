Well I know this is wrong, I left my wizard in Hate in case ayone needed a
ride out. When I logged in to gate out I was the only person in Hate, when I
gated after a fizzle and an unstable gate (talk about a scary place for this
to happen) I was the only one in the LR arena.

Considering that the targets of every other transportation spell routinely
have
as many as 8-10 people stacked on them, I would doubt this.

It could be tested, though, by binding two people at exactly the same spot
(using loc to get as close as possible to the exact same spot), and having
one
gate there, then the other. or, heck, tp yourself to a druid ring or wizard
spire and bind, then move away and have someone tp there, then try to gate.
