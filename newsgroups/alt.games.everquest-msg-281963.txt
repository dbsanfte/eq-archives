I keep hearing about what people have heard about stuff.

You don't have DoD but hear stuff about it.  Someone else doesn't have
anything after OoW but claims he hears stuff about stuff.

Experience it, then we can talk about it.

Because raiding is not JUST about loot.  It's about challenge, encounters,
working together on a bigger scale, doing something as a guild, a social
event, seeing zones and content you might otherwise not see.  This is even
truer when you're not a hard-core raiding guild.

Our little raiding alliance did the Carprin Cycle for the second time last
weekend and then went on to beat Bertox for the first time.  The loot from
the Carprin Cycle is well below anything you can get for peanuts in the
bazaar.  Yet it was still upgrades for some people (not everyone plays in
the same way), and more over, the event was a blast and people had *fun*.
