1.) At this level buffing is primarily what you do. Your slow is only
25%. So being a slower isn't really your primary duty now. I didn't
use my slows until mid 30's. Most mobs at this level drop so fast that
a slowing them is just a waste of mana.

What your primary role is will depend on the group. You don't become
"The Slower" until the 40's. Until then look to see what's missing.
You will probably be the main healer for many groups without a Cleric,
so you want to make sure the MT (main tank) is fully buffed (STR, AGL,
DEX, STA, AC, and HP. Though you don't get HP buffs yet) and you might
want to throw Burst of Strength on him. Most people don't see the
adventage of using the spell unless things start to go bad and that's
all you have mana for, but I use the upgraded version of that spell on
my warrior, and notice a siginificant drop on HP loss and a
significant increase in damage output. It's worth casting on the tank
once per mob at least. It helps them keep agro and makes them take
less damage, and makes the mob drop faster. All of which saves you
mana in the long run on heals.

If you already have a cleric for heals. You can cast your slow and
disempower on the tougher monsters, as well as your DoT's. Make sure
you keep enough mana to keep everyone SoWed and the MT buffed up. Time
how long it takes to kill the monsters. If your DoT runs out before
the monster drops, then use them. Otherwise just use a direct damage
spell when you have the mana to spare.

Shamans, aside from being buff dispencers don't have a defined class
duty until higher levels, where an unslowed mob is a dangerous thing.

2.) See the above answer. You can slow, disempower, and DoT the
tougher mobs, but only the ones that take several minutes to kill. If
they drop faster than that, it's usually more mana efficient to do
something else. At higher levels, even if the mob dies long before my
Slows fade, an unslowed mob at best causes the Cleric to use too much
mana, and at worst means the tank dropps faster than the cleric can
heal him, or makes the mob decide to kill the cleric before finishing
off the rest of the group. When your cleric starts having to cast more
than one or two big heals per fight, you know it's time to start
slowing. (Particularly if the mob will take the MT's health down past
30% before the group can kill it, without heals.) As for disempower,
it's effects are more subtle, and most groups tell you to stop wasting
your mana on that spell, assuming they notice you casting it at all.
In my experience, if the mob is pretty tough, and even when slowed (it
takes a long while to kill it) I like to cast my upgraded disempower.
It makes the Mob do slightly less damage (a few percent) and makes the
melee do slightly more damage (again a few percent) but it adds up
over a long fight. Also if you can't slow a mob (first I encountered
this was PoI) then you sure as hell better disempower it.

3.) Slow is any spell (Shaman or Enchanter) that reduces the attack
speed of a mob. Disempower isn't a commonly used spell (as I mentioned
above) but if a shaman or enchater does use it, they will usually say
the mob is crippled (the name of the higer level disempower). Tash is
the enchanter version of Malaise (which you get at level 19). All the
enchanter resistance debuffers follow the same sound Tashini, Tashan,
etc.. All the shaman debuffers follow the same sound Malase, Malo,
Malosi, etc... That being said, your debuff is king. Put it this way
the Enchanters tash from level 44 reduces magic resistance by about a
maximum of 33, your spell from 34 reduces Fire, Cold, Magic and
Poison, by a maximum of 40. Shaman debuffs rock. You also get a spell
that reduces disease resist, but it is seperate. Having the chanter
tash before you slow can be a real good idea to reduce the number of
resists you can get with slow, but your Malase line will make you very
popular with the Necros, Mages, Wizards, and anyone else that uses
DoT's and DD's. A must when you are in a group with a lot of spell
based DPS.

4.) See above.
