I have personally witnessed you commiting said genocide against those 
bixies on Fennin Ro, Hanrahan.  The fact that I was also engaged in 
such genocide at the time too, is a detail of no importance *cough*.


I placate myself by remembering the hell that bixies give my Barb 
whenever she's around.
