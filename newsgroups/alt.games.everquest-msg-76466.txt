This from Absor on the Sony Boards:
------------------------------------
Q: I am considering purchasing a horse for a couple of different
reasons:

1. It looks cool 
2. You can meditate and engage in combat in outside zones.
3. It makes you a little faster than running.

If all three of these reasons hold true, I think I will buy one...but if
reason number 2, meditating while fighting, is nerfed...I think I would
rather wait and just use my AA points to get a Holy Steed.

Thus, my question is this. Is meditating and engaging in combat an
unforseen consequence of horses that will be nerfed or is it legitimate?
This will weigh heavily upon my decision on purchasing a horse so I
would appreciate a clarification on this issue.

Thanks

A: Horses were not intended to a character to meditate while fighting.
That is indeed something we will be fixing in the very near future.
