I'd say go on a killing spree in Blackburrow for Surefall Glade people and
turn in the gnoll fangs from to the guy in Qeynos arena (sorry, cannot

[Tue Aug 20 22:42:22 2002] Your faction standing with Jaggedpine Treefolk

Jaggedpine zone faction might be trickier for your level. Things that give
good faction for it are the poachers and the Darkpaw gnolls.
