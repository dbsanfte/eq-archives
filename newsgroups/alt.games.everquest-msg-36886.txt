The wizard might have won the petition and gotten a rez but I don't believe
there would be a suspension out of this. And if Verant has reduced itself to
suspending accounts for duels whets next? If you duel any Druid, Shaman,
Necro, Enchanter, or Mage expect exp loss. You will loss exp if you die via
PET or DOT. Personally I see no benefit in dueling, and as far as I am
concerned they can nerf dueling completely.
