Hehe yeah me too. Gotta love Verants wordings at times.

Correct statement should have been

"Made an improvement to the animation code that may reduce the fucking
horrendous GFX lag and snarl ups that always occurs when a new player enters
a zone, which has been pissing you guys off for soooo fucking long. We are
really sorry that we suck so much and apologise for your exp loss and
downtime."

 "Would you care for a sammich?" No thanks I just had lunch
