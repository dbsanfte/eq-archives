The mystery deepens.

Tried this again last night with a 58 shaman in group, hammer poofed.

He told me he heard enchanters had a spell that would prevent poofing.

The only spell I'm 100% certain worked is VoG, because I've read the message
where jobartik got VoG.  Even that could be somehow someone playing a joke
on me and also casting some other spell with the real "makes pet stop
killing itself" power, although that would have to be a conspiracy over two
chanters with no known connection.

Now this is really starting to confuse me.
