    We have people who were in the Beta, yes, but not as "scouts". Honestly,
I don't think there will be much in LDoN to interest a  raiding guild that
is in Time. However, I'm a person, not a guild, and I want to explore the
heck out of this thing. Because of RL time constraints, raiding time
constraints, and a need to raise my AA level ( up to 201 now ), I haven't
been able to see the newly updated zones, or the pocket zones, or other
places that would be fun to at least visit. So I've booked next week off
work as vacation, and I plan to powergame the hell out of LDoN. I want just
enough information that I don't get bogged down in silly things like finding
NPCs, but can instead focus on overcoming the actual tactical challenges in
the missions (which I don't want any information on).

    James
