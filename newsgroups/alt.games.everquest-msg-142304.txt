Well, whatever it is you druids use when quad kiting, the ones that hit up
to four targets.  Having a druid that is all the way up to level 15, and has
been starving and dying of thirst in the Bazaar for the last 2 weeks or so,
I don't really have much of a clue when it comes to the specific spells
there.

As for ports, I was looking for something a little more general.  I can make
my own gate potions, well, not very successfully yet, but I can do it.  You
left out Thurgadin gate potion, that nifty one for CT, and the OT hammer
thingy.
