And yet we still have such difficulty with it.

I disagree.  Of course, I'm a bit odd in that I tend not to trust anyone who
can't even keep their oaths of marrige.  Call me cynical.

That's in the past, even before the founding of this nation.

Coveting, in this case, involves envey.  The idea isn't just to have what
your neighbor has, but also the desire to deprive him of it.  I think this
needs to be read out before any taxation bill.

The fact that many of the Commandments are no longer appropriate to modern
law does not have any bearing on the fact that they are the foundation apon
which modern law is built.  All you've proven is that they are religous in
nature, and not appropriate as -current- law.  I never suggested they were.

Not much for historical purposes, but not a bad foundation for enforceable
laws.
