Sometimes game purchases can simply change the game for you in a way that
makes it much more enjoyable.  For example, I know many players who NEVER
get to really high level in games...they like experimenting too much with
different classes.  If one of these people were to start DAoC, my
recommendation to them would be to play for a while to get familiar with the
game, and then go buy an account with a level 50 on it.  (Although, unlike
the situation that started this thread, that would not be against the rules.
Selling items and coin is against the DAoC rules, but selling a complete
account is allowed).

The reason for this is that in DAoC, if you have a level 50 on your account,
you are allowed to start new characters at 20, and there are NPCs that will
give you a started kit of armor and weapons that is good enough to get you
going at 20.  A couple hours then doing the 7/11/15 class quests for your
character will get you a nice class-specific armor or weapon, and you'll be
all set to go out and play with your level 20.

The thing about 20 is that it is high enough that you have the first spell
or two and first few weapon skills in every line of spells and weapon skills
that you would have at high level, for the most part.  (There will be some
things missing, sometimes...Healers specced the way I'm planning don't get
their instant mez until the 40's, for example).

Basically, this means that at 20, you get to experience pretty much the full
range of what your class can do.

Furthermore, at 20, you can start going to the 20-24 battleground, which is
fairly popular, so you can do the RvR stuff, without the hassle of getting
ganked by people waaaaaay higher than you that you get if you go to the
regular Frontier at that level.

A friend and I did this, except rather than buying accounts, we spent a
month (real time...it was 9 days /played for me and 7 for him) playing
Necromancers on the co-op server to get level 50.  Necromancers in DAoC are
ridiculously overpowered PvE killing machines.  With the ability to start at
20, it is a whole new game.  At Monday at work, we might decide that we
would like to try something new to us, say a Ranger and Nightshade duo for
the battleground.  We can make the characters that night, picking a server
where their realm is behind and so is given leveling bonuses, and with just
casual play, get them to 23 or 24 by the weekend, and go have battleground
fun.
