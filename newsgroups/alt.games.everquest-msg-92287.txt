> Everyone pays that dude, so like whats your point?

The point, my most ignorant fellow, is that your "Roadside Assistance"
is not free as you claimed. That is after all where this tangent
started. Perhaps this is all moving too fast for you.

>I have been with Ford since 1988. I pay less then any Associate, Z, or X plan buyer, and Damn sure
>pay less then the average consumer. What, you think they only charge employee's the overhead?

First off sticking with Ford is not a glowing endorsement of your
intellectual skills. They do have a thriving warranty and replacement
parts service though. 

Ford charges "EVERYONE" the overhead. It is built into the base price
of the car. But "YOU" obviously are so smart that you get Roadside
Assistance for free. You must be a "special" customer. I guess they
feel sorry for you.

It doesn't matter if you pay less than Henry Ford himself. Roadside
Assistance is not "Free" to you or anyone else.

> Oh, and research the "Holdback" charges a little more. Holdback charges
>come from the difference between MSRP and DAC stupid. And the dealer gets an
>additional 3% back as a burden rate for handling A plan sells dipwad.

I know how holdback works. I simplified the process since you appear
to be a bit slow. The 3% you claim to save off dealer invoice is
nothing to brag about and a dubious savings at best.

The bottom line is that each car FordMoCo sends out the door
incorporates all of the costs associated with that vehicle (covered
warranty repairs, Roadside Assistance, Taxes, Tarrifs, etc.) None of
these services are "free" even to Class A (sshole) buyers like
yourself.

> Now, don't bother with a reply, you already look real stupid playing
>pretend.

The only thing making me look stupid is replying to a troll like
yourself.

I shall now correct that error and add you to my kill file.
