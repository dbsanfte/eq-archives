    http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=11199 - all elemental armour is the
same.

    http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26995 - all Time items are the same.

    Items from major bosses in Air seem to be flagged Recommended 62 or
Required 65, items from Earth are Required 65, items from Water are Required
65, items from Fire are Required 65. Some augments may also make items more
restricted than they originally were (like a Solid Coal of Prowess on a
Vindi BP).
