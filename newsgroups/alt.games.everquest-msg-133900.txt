Excellent summary. You *can* get jumped at the druid ring, but it's a
less populated area, and if you do it's far more likely to be a wurm,
sperm, or a drake. They're all pretty slow (ok, unless you happen to get
Black Scar) and they don't debuff. Also, the druid port in is pretty
close to the valley that runs into BW. I think you can see the entry
from the port-in.

The wizzy landing point is in the middle of the dragon temple area. It's
a bit further from the BW zone valley (which you can't see from there,
so newcomers can be easily confused) and one HELL of a long run from the
OT zone. It's generally littered with Chromodracs, and if you don't have
jboots or tboots and their first debuff takes your SoW, you're pretty
well fucked.

Wizzy portin is a suicide run compared to the druid port in.
