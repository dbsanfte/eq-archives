CH is more efficient than Celestial assuming the mage has decent HP totals
and low HP aggro isn't a problem.  I actively encouraged all my mage
friends to concentrate on HP gear over any other factor, every 300 hp is
one more mod rod charge consumable prior to CHeal.  Now, of course,
I'm left with a bunch of over HP'd mages who are never getting another
CHeal as long as they live :)

A better fix would have been to leave mod rods as is, but make them
not summonable in the PoP.  Then they could tune PoP raids without
the rods, but leave luclin encounters (where they are essential) intact.
Counting on them to juggle around every SOL encounter of any real
size to compensate for lack of rods seems like asking an awful lot
from people who can't even fix the (insert your favorite broken quest here)
