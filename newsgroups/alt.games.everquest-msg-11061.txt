one of the best ways for a low-level character to make money is to do
time-consuming things for higher-level characters.  gathering stacks of
bone chips and silk swatches, and making runs to town to buy food and
to exchange silver/gold for plat are prime examples.  higher-level
chars will pay you to do these things for them, because they don't want
to take the time.
