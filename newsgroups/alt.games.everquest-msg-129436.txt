I use the eeny-meeny-miny-moe method.

In other words, I mezz the first thing I target.  If the mezz is broken I
target the other one and mezz it.  If there's only 2 the Law of Averages
says that, over time, you're going to be right the first time, 50% of the
time. <g>

If you're having trouble targeting the second, try hitting F9 and get a
top-down view.
