that cash rate sounds pretty on the money, actually a lot higher than i
experienced.  on xmas eve i ran to RM, and found it totally deserted.  i was
the only person in the zone the whole night.  i play a ranger, so it was all
archery and melee for me.  i always carry extra stuff in my inventroy, so i
had to make a run to the gypsies probably every 45 minutes.
it was close to 4 hours i guess, and i ended up with just about an even 1k.
only killed giants if i could help it, only looted FS and the lambient stone
(i think thats what it was).  not bad, but not great.
