First - it's not the max damage, it's the level. 
Second - When grouping with my guildmates, root isn't an issue,
they know the drill, mob starts running, spike roots it - they
back out and let him finish it off.  Because of the way pet
aggro works, he's usually near 100%.  It's PU groups that I have
to retrain for this.

But, I vastly prefer a non-rooting pet.

I have.  I've grouped a lot in my 51 levels on this mage and 20 on
my first one on Povar.  I vastly prefer to group.  But I just can't
have a level 37 pet on a 45 ish mob.  Since I rely on a pet for
the majority of my damage in a quick pull XP group, he has to carry
his weight.  In a quick pull situation, mana regen simply does not
allow a nuke on every pull.  I tend to keep a 60-70% reserve for a
quick burn down when it's needed.

Not if the melee's arent' so stuck in their ways that they have to 
hang in there to the final blow.  I group with a RL friend of mine
(a 53 ranger) a lot.  He knows the drill and helps teach the others.
By the end of a play session, everyone in the group calls my pet
Spike. When they back out at the end and let him finish it, they
cheer him on.  I have *NO* problems getting groups with guildies and
people I've grouped with in the past.  But certain perceptions do
get in the way of getting PU groups.  I was very worried after Alan's
initial response to the Mage Compedium Q&A that every thing I knew
about pets taking XP in a group didn't work the way I'd always thought,
and that letting spike finish a nearly dead mob was a bad idea.  He
has since corrected himself, and confirmed that it works the way most 
mages had previously thought (The pet has to do >50% of the damage
to take any xp).  So I was a bit grumpy when I wrote the last response
:/
