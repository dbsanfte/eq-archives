I think I'd have to walk away for a while.

Maybe I'd start a newbie, but, I'm more likely to look for a new game. I'd
also have to work off the inevitable greiving process of losing a part of
myself that is currently so very central to my being. I'm an addict, and I
know it. But if what I was addicted to wasn't there any more (my chracters,
my friends), it's time to enjoy other things I love.
