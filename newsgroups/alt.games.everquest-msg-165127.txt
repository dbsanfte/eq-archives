If you look at them, the only ones you really want are the hammer spell
and the aoe stun, at least IMO. If you can get virtue at 62, why would
you want a group symbol. Until Group Virtue I see using Group Aego and
single Virtue on tanks. For raids I can also single kazad casters that
want to use PotG Armor of the Zealot is listed as 65 on Caster's Realm
and in Lucy. Catastrophe is 64 and looks like an upgrade to upheaval,
not a spell I use very often.

In summary, I think there's no big loss in not having most of the 63-64
spells from what I've seen, at least the way I play my cleric. The 3
most important spells, IMO, for a cleric, are the new remedy, virtue and
maybe the new elixer, though it's a tossup on elixer, being as it slowly
heals 2k for the cost of 400 mana. For the same reason I don't see the
new light spell as one I'd use much. The casting time of ~4 seconds
would rarely justify the huge increase in mana cost.

Having got to 65 rather quickly, I find the rapid aa gain in a good
group well worth the effort, as I'm quickly catching up on Luclin aa
skills I didn't get due to the lack of demand for clerics for most aa
experience groups pre-PoP.
