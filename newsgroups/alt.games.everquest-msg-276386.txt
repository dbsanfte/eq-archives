I had this problem. I solved it by deleting the file
<servername>_<charactername>_eq2_uisettings.ini and I log in and set
up the display the way I want. I save the new file into another
directory and use it as a template for my other characters. Change the
name in the other directory and copy it over the file in the eq2
directory. Since I did this I haven't had any problems. 

This way you only need to set up all the window features once.

YMMV
