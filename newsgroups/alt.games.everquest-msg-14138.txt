Hmmm... another person to add to my Borg-esque collective...

The sad part is that people like you feel compelled to try and believe everyone
who disagrees with you is a single entity because, sadly, you believe in truth
via vox popli.




================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."

                   From "Travels with Charlie"
