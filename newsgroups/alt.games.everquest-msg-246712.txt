AA? Eye Candy? wtf do I need with AA and Eye Candy?

In EQ most people have spell effects turned down or off, sky off, 
shorter clipping planes etc... to ensure they can respond quickly to the 
game even during a busy lag spike when 20 spells go off at once and 30 
people are in your LoS... even people with top-end video cards. People 
need FPS and responsiveness not eye-candy. Eye candy is only worth 
anything if it doesn't detract from the gameplay... as soon as its a 
trade-off eye candy loses... its worthless. Bouncing raindrops are not 
going to help me survive/win. And if I've got time to admire bouncing 
raindrops then I'm probably not paying attention to what i should be. :)

I have *never* been inclined to enable AA on any game. FSAA hype drives 
me friggen nuts. Sure FSAA makes a still shot look better, but I do not 
care if my captured screenshots are another iota more photorealistic, 
with a couple jaggies or geometry artifacts blurred away... especially 
since it invariably costs me FPS.

I'll take the extra FPS...FSAA can stuff it...unless I'm playing quake 
III or something else old and my framerate is still effectively capped 
at my screen refresh rate.

I saw elsewhere someone reported 26fps... That is a touch weak, but not 
unplaybable, and certainly not 'very very slowly'. 30FPS is perfectly 
fine in the vast majority of games, eq in particular as it isn't even a 
twitch game. 45+ is excellent, and... anything much beyond 60 is 
generally a waste. At best it will reduce eye-strain a bit during 
extended play sessions.

Once a game is delivering 60plus fps even when the action gets hot 
(which is when you need fps the most)... then I will turn on 'eye candy' 
and 'fsaa'.

I will look into this...

When all is said and done ... if I get stable 26fps on my 2nd box in 
everquest with all eye candy turned on then I will be more than 
perfectly satisfied.
