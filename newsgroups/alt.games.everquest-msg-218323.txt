Its not bottom posting, its "snip and tuck" posting; we cut out
parts that aren't relevant, and post replies directly under each
relevant post.

Bottom posting is nearly as bad as top posting, it still results
in long posts followed by longer replies followed by longer still
responses and so on; because there's no snipping you
automatically get at least a little longer every post.

Further, you lose the conversational advantage that newsgroup
style posting can afford, always replying to an entire missive
all at once, which requires a person trying to figure out what
you are talking about to go back up and reread and reread to see
which parts of the post up there (or in the case of top posting,
down there) each of your points is in response to.

Since some of the posts here can run to 300+ lines of new text,
this can be a serious mess.

Much easier to read 

>>>>>Point one
>>>>Response to point one
>>>Rebuttal to response
>>Correction to rebuttal to point one
>Rephrased rebuttal to point one
Response to rephrased rebuttal
>>>>>Point two
>>>>Response A to point two
>>>Rebuttal to response A to point two
>>>>Response B to point two
>>>Agreement with response B to point two

than it is to read the same arguement as

>>>>>Point one
>>>>>Point two
>>>>Response to point one
>>>>Response A to point two
>>>>Response B to point two
>>>Rebuttal to response one
>>>Rebuttal to response A to point two
>>>Agreement with response B to point two
>>Correction to rebuttal to point one
>Rephrased rebuttal to point one
Response to rephrased rebuttal

But this (bottom posting) is still superior to 

Response to rephrased rebuttal
>Rephrased rebuttal to point one
>>Correction to rebuttal to point one
>>>Rebuttal to response one
>>>Rebuttal to response A to point two
>>>Agreement with response B to point two
>>>>Response to point one
>>>>Response A to point two
>>>>Response B to point two
>>>>>Point one
>>>>>Point two

Easiest of all to follow, though, would be 

>>>>>Point one
>>>>Response to point one
>>>Rebuttal to response
>>Correction to rebuttal to point one
>Rephrased rebuttal to point one
Response to rephrased rebuttal

Where the entirety of point two, settled several iterations ago,
has been pruned out of the conversational tree.

If posts were all short and simple, top or bottom posting would
both be fine, and in fact top posting would actually be superior
once you got used to it, since you wouldn't have to scroll down
to the bottom to find out what the new poster has to say, and if
you already understand the thread up to that point, won't have
any need to do so at all.

But this newsgroup doesn't have many posts that short, or threads
that short; by and large even with substantial snippage posts are
over 30 lines each, long enough that you can't see the whole
thing in one window; and they tend to have several subsections to
them...
