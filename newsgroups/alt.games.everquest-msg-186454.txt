Then you're not looking hard enough. Just last week my fun, new 10 druid
was in a Crushbone group with (a) the 11 ranger who didn't know what
tracking was, and (b) the 10 mage who hadn't trained in meditate yet. And
the week before that I helped a level 1 druid turn in his guild note, train
skills, equip gear, buy spells, scribe them, mem them, cast them, use the
bank, hail NPCs, and change autoattack to some key other than 'a'...

Just keep your eyes peeled for naked newbs punching bats in the newbie
zones. They don't stay "true, honest to goodness, never played the game
before" newbies for long.
