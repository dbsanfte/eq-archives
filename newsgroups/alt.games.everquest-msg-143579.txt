Hmm.  I've been thinking a lot lately about how broken enchanters are, 
because apparently, if I claim we're broken, I might get the changes to my 
class that I realy, really want.

I think it comes down to just three changes that chanters MUST HAVE in 
order to function properly in the high end game:

1.  Illusion: Gender. (note: must stack with other illusions.  It is 
    absolutely necessary for me to be able to be a female Ogre.)
2.  Voice Graft.  (What good are dire-charmed pets if we can't play 
    ventriloquist with them?)
3.  I want a @#$%! POINTY HAT!

Thank you for your time.  Please be sure to sign my soon-to-be-released 
'un-nerf the chanter' petition.
