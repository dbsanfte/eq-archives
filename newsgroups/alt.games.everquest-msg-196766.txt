I don't seem to get your original posts only replies, I did make a Magelo
profile up for my Shaman but have just read you cannot view them :�(

Anyway, the equipment (you can't see) has not changed much since level 15.
At 20th I replaced Split Paw Gloves with SCHW, at 30th I bought "Her" a
Barbarian Spiritists Hammer then when I hit 39 I sold it and went back to
Intel's Hammer...I will be replacing the SCHW soon as well...may go back to
them later, am not doing too much melee'ing atm. At 39 I would say I am
reaching the sort of level that I should be for most of this equipment

Looking at your equipment I wouldn't say it was excessive for the level of
character...only the hand wraps and Ikky BP would identify the character as
a twink, imo and even then they are not really that unbalanced....Want to
see twinked, wait for Martin to make another alt ;�)
