I'm lvl 24 and still havent done any of the AQ's (bought a full set of 
pristine carb). I am now looking to do them and was wondering if I mentor a 
lvl 19 doing the AQ1 will I still get the piece of armour? If so this is 
great, I can go back and complete all the quests I have missed out on and 
hand the stuff I dont need to my alts.
