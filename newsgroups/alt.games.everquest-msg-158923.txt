    He's a gnome, south center area building roughly. Ask him "what armor"
(and not "what armour" like this silly Canadian did a few times to no
response) and he'll give you the quest.

    If you want an orientation tour of PoK, try this quest:

http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm54.showMessage?topicID
=11.topic

    About two-thirds down that page is a listing of the /loc of each of the
NPCs in the quest. As you talk to each NPC, look around and figure out what
area you're in. Are there vendors around? What do they sell? After you've
done this quest, you'll know the place inside-out and have a start on a
quest for a neat ranged slot item.
