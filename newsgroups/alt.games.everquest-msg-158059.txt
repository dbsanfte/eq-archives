Just throwing in my pedestrian thoughts here. I have a 52 Warrior with
the same combo - Wurmy and CentiLS. I switched to dual CentiLS's and
hated it. Seemed like every other melee 10 levels below me was out
damaging me (well - i was feeling quite.. limp) - had a hard time with
aggro. Fortunately I didnt get rid of the Wurmy and switched back and
am happy again.
