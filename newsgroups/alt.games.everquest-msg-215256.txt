Ray and Thomas, thank you! I keep a copy of my EQ log file in a briefcase on
my desktop, I just update its contents after my EQ sessions. Doing this
saves me from having to manually search through several layers of
sub-directories to find my log. I simply open it from the briefcase.

I wasn't aware that the character log files were given a different name
until now, I don't recall any reference to this in the patch message .. So,
DT, whilst it may have been *obvious* in *your* humble opinion, it certainly
wasn't obvious to me!

Thanks again guys,

Kind regards,

Stevie.
