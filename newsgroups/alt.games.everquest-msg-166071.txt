Definately not true, I am on my third bard ( I keep loving them then
get disgusted when they level far enough to do that skipyy flute
thingie).  Anyway, he has been reincarnated with the same name 2 times

I do find however, that you cant delete a character and use the name
again right away.  Not sure the timing on this but eventually it seems
to get freed up.
