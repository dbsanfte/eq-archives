I like the zone, it looks really nice with all the statues and various 
things (though I haven't been all around it yet). The windmill looks 
especially cool from afar.

I do have one problem with it though, it's near the Firiona Vie zone area. 
On the left side of the river that flows in to the lake, as you're 
traveling toward the lake, the invisible barrier seems horribly misplaced. 
Normally you will climb some tall hills or mountains or some other terrain 
which then has an invisible wall preventing you from going further, but it 
seems logical because you can't see what's over that hill anyway and you 
would expect it to be in such a place often times. In this area, however, 
the wall comes way in, almost next to the river itself. I can see trees 
and shrubs back there, some little plain clearings, and then in the back 
there's the elevated rocky areas you'd expect the invisible wall to be at. 
But here you can't even go over there. What's even stranger is when you're 
coming back toward the river from the field with the statues and stuff, 
there's an area that is almost like a cauldesac of invisible walls. You 
can enter it from the plain side, but once you're in there you get 
surrounded by the wall (which shouldn't be there in my opinion). A few 
more steps in a river direction and you'd be able to see the river, but 
the wall separates you from it. One time I had tigers chasing me and I ran 
that direction making a break for the zone, but instead I found myself 
trapped, whereby I swiftly died.

Why would they design it in such a way?
