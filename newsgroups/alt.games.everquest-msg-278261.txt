First thing for me to say is that I group with my friends and guildmates,
and we don't put groups together based on min-maxing, we put groups
together based on who's lfg.  For example, DoN missions with three
enchanters, a cleric, a warrior and a necro.  It's the advantage of being
guilded with reasonable people.

So that out of the way, I play a warrior.

If you're putting a group together and you're trying to get as much
functionality into it as possible,

Warrior - extra mitigation, probable HP advantage over a similar geared
Knight.  Erm, that's it.

Paladin - heals, rezzes, cures, stuns, buffs, good snap hate.

Shadow Knight - higher dps, debuffs, FD, snare, good snap hate.

Depending on the content you do, Knight classes tank fine and bring with
them a host of additional benefits.

In our guild, we've always assumed that all tank classes can tank normal XP
content equally well in all expansions.  Warriors tank high-end raid
content in the newest expansion.  Knights tank high-end raid content from
one or two expansions ago.  Assuming similar gear all around.
