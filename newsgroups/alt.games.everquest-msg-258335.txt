I think CA law just says no bicycles, motorized bicycles, or mopeds on the 
freeway. Or most freeways.  There's generally a sign by the entrance to 
that effect.   Should be OK on highways, though, as long as the highways 
are not freeways.  There could be some more specific rule, though, that 
I'm not aware of.  

But the situation under discussion is a posted minimum speed for all 
vehicles using that road.
