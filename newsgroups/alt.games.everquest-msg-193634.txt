I solo summoning mobs using my pet.  It helps a lot that I can slow the 
mobs, haste and buff my pet, as well as DoT the mob.  My pet also taunts, 
so even if I do get summoned, I just move away, and the pet gets aggro back 
ater a bit.  If the mob is rootable, I also root it so that it can only get 
to me by summoning me.  If my pet cannot tank the mob with me keeping it 
healed, I move on to other mobs.  As a druid, you will certainly want a 
pet, and you will want him to be able to handle taking a lot of damage, as 
you cannot slow the mob, and your charmed pet will not taunt.  Healing your 
pet will likely get you aggro at times, if you also toss DoTs and/or nukes 
on the mob, that will just increase the liklihood of getting summoned.
