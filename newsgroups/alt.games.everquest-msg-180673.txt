During a Bazaar discussion on levelling, someone claimed to have levelled a
Shaman to 30th in 3 days, I questioned whether he meant 3days Real time or
72hrs played, as it took me a Week real time to do it and that was power
levelling...some 30hrs played. He claimed it was a weekend and consisted of
one 16hr session and two 20hr sessions. That may not be a record but sheesh,
56 hrs in 3days, I thought I was putting some time in with a little over
30hrs in 7days...What a light weight I am.

After 30th I slowed down and play normal now, hopefully some of my casting
skills will catch up soon :ï¿½)
