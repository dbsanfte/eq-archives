Yes my pet is the 39 pet and the weapons are the Blade of Kedge and Blade of
Walnan. There high level norent weapons made by Magicians. I tried them and
said my pet doesn't have the Will to use them. I've looked and can't find
level for these to work. There's also a face piece mag's summon that gives
haste that stacks with pets and a no rent waist piece with 500hps on it. You
add all that to pet and I'm curious to see the difference it makes.  =)
