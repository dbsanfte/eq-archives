There's your problem right there - stop hunting welfare mobs :)

At your level you can take on stuff that drops fine steel weapons (5pp
or so from a vendor), and this sort of beastie generally drops more cash
than bronze-dropping types. Get in a group outside Paw and whack gnolls
or something. And if you do go to South Karana, you'll be in a zone with
lots of rare drops from wandering mobs (Thunderhoof quiver, electrum
bracelet, etc) and quest item drops (for gem-inlaid gauntlets, crafted
gauntlets, etc). Also, most mobs are in their twenties so they'll drop a
ton of research words, runes etc. Also Centaurs drop ringmail, sells for
a couple of pp. Hell, you're a necro - go whack treants, lots of xp and
cash for that. Treants are low 20s in level, have low hp and drop tons
of cash (just all in small change, but people will play banker there in
return for a cut). You just need to avoid meleeing them and take them
out quickly - a necro should have no trouble. Yes, the more I think
about it, the more profitable South Karana sounds for someone of your
level.

And don't stress about it - well-equipped people are probably twinks, or
at least have run another character up in levels before and so know the
cash-cows and what/where to hunt for best rewards. It will get better as
you level.
