Heh.  You've taken the "where" out of context.

Think "where" as in "from a closet" or "from an arsenal."
If it's "from a closet," it's applicable to the Second Amendment.
If it's "from an arsenal," it's not, at least if that arsenal
isn't privately owned by citizens prior to the rebellion.

Afghanistan, despite instances where WWI weapons were used to shoot
at USSR troops, isn't on target.  They won because they got modern
weapons from outside sources (outside the context of the Second
Amendment) not because they had a sufficient citizen-held arsenal.

Citing Afghanistan as a successful example of application of a
people's right to keep and bear arms is clearly wrong.  It wasn't.
And we're a long way from the American Revolution or the Civil War
when military and civilian weapons were largely indistinguishable.
