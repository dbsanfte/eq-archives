So then, you'd have no problem with the term "asshole" used to describe
someone being a jerk? Those two terms can be synonymous. 

How about "motherfucker" when describing incest?

Mysogny, thy name is tcells.

>Is "beaver" objectionable when used to describe hard work?

No, but it is also completely innaccurate. "Eager Beaver" would be the
correct term, and no, that would not be objectionable.

>  Is "snatch"
>objectionable when used to describe grabbing at something?

Also no. Welcome to the wonderful world of context.

Using the word "pussy" to relate to anything besides an actual feline is an
objectionable, and offensive term, and Blizzard is completely and totally
within their rights to do whatever they want. Your thick headed
unwillingness to see it does not change this very essential fact.
