I've never been a fan of tricked out Honda's but I've had a lot of good 
experience with a variety of sports cars, several of them of the 4 
banger variety. Anyhow, I wanted to bring your attention to:

The now discontinued: Porsche 968 Turbo S

I've provided a link:
http://vista.pca.org/stl/968t.htm

As you can see, torque and hp (and 0-60mph time) compares quite strongly 
versus a Corvette V8 (with twice the cylinders and nearly twice the 
displacement).

Moreover, the Porsche is balanced car, drives beautifully, and doesn't 
suffer from any of the problems you noted that 'over-tuned' Civics 
suffer from.

Personally I've never driven one of these; though I would have bought 
one if they'd been available in any numbers; However I have had 
extensive experience with predecessors in the line (the regular 968 and 
the 944Turbo/944TurboS), which were also all *amazing* 4-bangers in 
their own right.
