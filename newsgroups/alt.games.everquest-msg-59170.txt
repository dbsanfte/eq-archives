If you're hunting in the pit, you should be able to take out the Ice
Giants, and get exp doing so.  I've generally cleared them on the way
into the pit, messed around in the pit, and been able to clear the
respawn on the way out.  They drop something the warriors need for a
quest (epic?), so they generally seem happy to do this.  Another nice
thing about the pit is that you can bring your druid buddies along for
more than just evac, they can do crowd-control since the pit is full
of animals.  Not sure I would trust most druids doing crowd-control,
but they seem to have a blast doing it.
