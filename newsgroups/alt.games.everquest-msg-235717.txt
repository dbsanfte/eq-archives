Look, he's insisting on a personality test from his prospectives. It's 
easy to select personality types that are moldable to his way of 
thinking. He prefers homeschooling, and later says that education 
shouldn't matter as they are going to all live on the farm forever. He 
does have an awful lot of contradictory statements throughout. You don't 
have to be religious to be a cult.

I don't know how old you are, but go print out the site and share with 
other adults you know, and preferably with someone in the mental health 
field. Show it to someone you know who has been abused and have them 
point out the red flags to you and explain what the implications of 
those flags are. Seriously, if you can't recognize how fucked in the 
head this guy probably is, I strongly urge some relationship counseling 
so you don't end up a bitter, lonely misogynist.
