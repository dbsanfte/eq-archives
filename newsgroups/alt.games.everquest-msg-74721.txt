You never could recharge items, they must have just got more
items. Very few items could ever be 'recharged' and even then it was
not recharging but the person just giving you a new item with the only
case I know of being the halfling squad ring.

Not really clear on what you are saying but it seems to me what was
probably happening if they were holding a final on a prod server was
that a guild of people were just giving the participants new items
when they used up the charges on the first ones.

It has never been that way.

It never existed in the first place.
