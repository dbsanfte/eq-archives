How about having it so taunt exchanges the Warrior's position on the hate
list with the person who is #1, leaving that Warrior with that person's hate
value, and that person with the Warrior's prior hate value.

That could lead to some interesting possibilities.  For example, in a group
or raid with multiple taunters, if someone such as a Cleric or Enchanter or
Wizard gets aggro, instead of the MT taunting the mob off them, that job
could fall to the taunter who is most likely lowest on the hate list.

Make it so one of the group/raid leader abilities is to get a listing of the
hate list of the mob, with hate values, and group/raid leader becomes a much
more interesting job.

(BTW...looking at some of the new abilities...anyone else wondering how long
until they just start bundling ShowEQ in with EQ? :-))

My Wizard has at least temporarily retired at 61, to wait a few months for
the various 58+ spells I'd like to come down in price.  (May not ever be
back...been passing the time in DAoC with a friend, and my Necro on the
co-op server is probably going to hit 50 over Thanksgiving, and then I'll
probably get heavily into solving the puzzles and quests in the Trials of
Atlantis expansion.  DAoC co-op is reminding me a lot what EQ was like back
before the marketing people took over.  Might have to wait for EQ2 to give
EQ another shot).

I think the Bards still have it worse.  The Ranger probably isn't swapping
between three different bows for each shot. :-)
