I'm not trying to start a WoW vs EQ battle (that seems to happen
nicely w/o me) but I was just on vacation for 2 weeks, and when I come
back there are 50 posts in the EQ newsgroup (mostly mourning the lack
of posts) and 23,908 posts in the WoW newsgroup.  I think the lack of
posts has a little more to do with the relative popularity of the two
games than it does with the death of usenet.
