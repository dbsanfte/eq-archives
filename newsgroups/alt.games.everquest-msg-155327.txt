I think a lot are in your shoes.  I know I was.  No sow (after 30
mins)...maybe no way for you to stumble on a zone line unless you're
lucky...FINDING wherever it is you're trying to go....

Dungeons are a challenge.  It's also where the best loot drops.  By the time
you're in your 30s start getting used to a dungeon...any dungeon, then
broaden your horizons.  You'll be glad you did.
