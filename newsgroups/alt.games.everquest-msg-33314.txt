There are also spiderlings in toxxulia, but why go to that
hell hole when you can go to everfrost.  You get
spiderlings, large spiders, and giant spiders all in one
zone, as well as the numerous other mobs in everfrost.  At a
guess you could do 1 to 50+ without ever leaving everfrost
if you wanted to.  I think you would be bored senseless but
it could be done.
