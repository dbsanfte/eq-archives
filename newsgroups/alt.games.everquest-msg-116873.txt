Well I have my final title (sensei) and several of my guildies do, but no
rangers do.
I haven't actually seen a 'Hunter' yet (tho I don't doubt they exist on
prexus), I still thing to base ranger damage on something a select few level
60's have isn't realistic though

Primal means *all* of my stats are at 255 (excluding sta - which isn't
relevant in dps), it also adds considerable +atk.  I don't think the effect
is limited just to rogues, not by an means.

But you mention not needing to swap it back in for another 6 mins - that
means you won't swap it back in until avater fades - so its not a substained
dps increase, as you now need to wait for it to proc again (when avater
isn't proc'd, i can find myself waiting a while for it to proc.. however
ones proc'd, it is up for 99% of the time from then on)

I did a fair bit of logging, with my different weapons in the not so distant
past.. I'll parse them when i get round to it.
