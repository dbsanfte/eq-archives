Correct me if I'm wrong here, but you wouldn't need to. What you'd
need is:

1) The binary release. This is available from his homepage.

2) The source. Ditto.

3) The EXACT SAME compiler as he used, down to DLL versions etc...

3a) (I'm not totally sure if this matters, but it probably does)
The EXACT SAME OS, down to minor patches.

4) (Within reason) The same architecture. I'd suppose that any
Pentium-class or newer processor would be good enough. I don't
suppose MapX is very hardware-dependant? ;)

Read the source, and understand it, to ascertain there's no malicious
code in it. Compile the source with the compiler. Since compilation
of source is a deterministic process, the binary should match the
binary provided by you, bit for bit. Do a binary compare, cmp(1), for
example, to see that the files match. If they don't, distrust the
executable.

Hmm, looking at all that, maybe it'd be less work to decompile the
sucker. Never mind then...
