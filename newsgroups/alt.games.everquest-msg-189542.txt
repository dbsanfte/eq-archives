Ah.  It all becomes clear.  I can solo a goblin wizard in BB, but it's
definitely the toughest fight I've had in the area.  Shamans are a little
easier.  I haven't tried enraged or crazed goblins yet.

The other day, I saw a goblin wizard in the crossroads goblin camp.  I
figured I'd blast him, and then deal with the others in the camp at my
leisure.  I neglected to check what the others were.  One was a mere goblin,
but the other was a shaman.  They all came out when I attacked the wizard.
Needless to say, I died.

Cheers,
Eric
