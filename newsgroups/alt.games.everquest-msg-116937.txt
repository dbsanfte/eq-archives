Nope. Brell followers start out indifferent to Coldain whereas 
everyone else starts apprehensive as far as I know. Rallos Zek
followers start dubious to giants whereas everyone else starts
threatening as far as I know.

Pretty sure everyone starts out KOS to CoV dragons but I wouldn't
doubt that different religions bring different degrees of KOS.
How about a Veeshan-following bard? Vah Shir are all agnostic,
though.

As for how long it takes without Kael work...a long time. My druid
of Karana was ally with coldain well before getting to dubious with
the CoV dragons. I know that killing the drakkel dire wolves only
gives miniscule faction changes.
