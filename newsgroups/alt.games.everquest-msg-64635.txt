everything seems to be working ok this mornig, except when i started the patched, all of the icon on
my desktop wouldn't let me d-click and when i would r-click and say open, they all gave me the
error: EverQuest patcher is already running. Have had to use the start button for the first time in
many a moon! The patcher is telling me I have about 21 minutes left.......
