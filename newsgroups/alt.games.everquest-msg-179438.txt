Camping Lodi from server up..

Id already set myself up for a fucked up schedule, going to sleep Thursday
evening, waking at 11pm to kill Lodi.  Then stayed awake till 6am, went to
work, started the new Lodi camp w/friends (patch day)

Get home 3pm Friday (been awake since 11pm Thursday) and await Lodi...  i
wait, and wait, and wait and wait.. I whine and bitch, we get extremely
tired.

We were doing anything to pass the time..  playing some silly random game,
Id say a number, and we got 3 rolls each to try and get the closest (but not
higher than) the number.  I kinda sucked at that game, not sure why.

It got to about 3am and one guy gave up, he'd gone Linkdead and just didn't
have the willpower or desire to log back on.  So now were down to 3 r/l
people (and about 7 chars) and desperatly try to pass the time.

Occasionaly were greeted with the sight of other Lodi campers.. the odd
green con ranger, an amusingly annoying beggar bard, guild_ks (a
Japanese/Korean guild with a terrible reputation).. most people found a very
defensive monk, dare they ask about pop times, or even step inside my camp
area!

The camp was gruelling, and no way was I going to lose it to "the bad
guild".. I think they were quite surprised by my direct tell informing them
Lodi was camped, and nothing and nobody would take him from me (whether a
direct warning was enough for them, or my guild tag did the talking, I don't
know.. either way they got the message, 30 seconds later they were gone.)

Around 4am a friend was doing his 8th shawl war, we were all set to help
(but in no real state to), thankfully his guild gave him good enough support
that we werent needed to abort our camp.

Surfing EQ messageboards was getting boring, hitting track every x seconds,
wondering if the druid tracking skill was enough, wondering if maybe he had
spawned outside tracking range, been pulled away and killed, without me even
noticing.

Anything and everybody got me paranoid.. I know what a CS nightmare Lodi
always was.. maybe THE most ks'd mob in the game?

5am, awake for 30 hours, wondering if the camp was really worth what I was
putting myself through?  I'd ran out of things to keep myself occupied, the
conversation between the 3 of us had dried up (the other 2 are a r/l couple,
so I guess they used "r/l speak" to keep awake)

I was still checking track repeatedly.. I didn't really know how to use it,
I had no clue about the ordering of it...  people in the NG assured me
anything that popped after id zoned in would appear at the top of the
tracking list.   After about 2 hours id began to accept this, and stopped
scrolling through the entire tracking list, mearly looking for a red name,
and hitting escape when I didn't see it.  20 seconds later, check tracking
again.. rinse and repeat.

By 6am the goofs claiming lodi in OOC, the stupid beggars telling me to
inspect them, and why they needed xxx from lodi etc had all gone..  IC was a
pretty lonely place, 31 hours and I was pshyically beginning to ache, my
eyes hurt like hell whether they were open or closed.

I started to drift off, who knows how long for?  Could have been 5 seconds,
could have been 5 minutes.  I was constantly checking track..  but was I?
Hell it could have been a dream for all I know.

The shawl war guy had joined us, I think he was probably bored, him wide
awake and fresh in our group, with 3 sleepy brits too exhausted even to
type.  I drifted off a few times I think.. basically head in hands above my
keyboard (which could have been ouch if my hand slipped!)

I checked track in between a minute of resting my eyes, I began to learn the
list off by heart.. this stupid turtle was doing his damned to ward me off.
I woke up again from a brief sleep, again it couldn't have been any more
than a few seconds or minutes, I hit track, and even tho the list was mostly
a blur, i saw a red con mob.

Barely awake or able to type, my incoherent yells of "pop" and "lodi" (which
were more like LDZ!  LD!!  LOZE!!) alerted the rest of the group..  a sudden
rush of adrenalin and I was wide awake, heart pumping, and sheer relief he
had finally shown his head.

Within a minute he was dead, ecstatic he had finally popped, that we could
now sleep (and also had the spawn time locked down), we were also bitterly
dissapointed that the one item we did want hadn't dropped.

There was a guarantee of 10+ hours sleep though before eneding to worry
about the next pop, and with the help of an american friend, and that crazy
British couple, we were able to keep the spawn claimed for the next pop.

How refreshing, I awaken to an icq, immediatly log on, and within an hour
the turtle is popped and dead.. with a vengance for the gruelling ordeal he
put us through the previous night, it was 1 step in the right direction to
getting him back.

8 steps later, and the tought of his name doesn't make me want to scream
with rage now, im sure we can call it quits soon :)
