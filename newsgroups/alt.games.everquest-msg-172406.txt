Good thinking. Only when you have a good grasp of how the standard 
"Players vs. Monsters" EQ works can you get an idea of whether you would 
enjoy PvP. Unsurprisingly, most people have found that they wouldn't.

It's a special ruleset that only applies to the "roleplaying preferred" 
server, Firiona Vie. TLC means that if your character kills a monster 
that is so below your level that you can no longer gain experience from 
killing it, you also aren't allowed to loot any magic items or quest 
elements that that monster may carry. A good idea in theory, but such a 
headache in practice that it has been scrapped entirely from the 
"normal" servers.

The other two aspects that make FV unique is that you are only allowed 
one character, and that different races do not have a common language (
what's spoken by other races displays as gibberish in your chat window 
until you acquire a certain proficiency in that language).
