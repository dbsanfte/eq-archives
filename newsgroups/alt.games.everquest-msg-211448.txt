But now your talking about someone's living, so it's not just a game
anymore.  It is a game played by professionals for money.  At that
point you can equate it to your job or my job, it matters.  There are
no professional EQ players (at least not according the EULA) so the
phrase holds up.

It's not an excuse, it's a philosophy.  Poor behaviour is not excused
by the phrase, it's something to think about so you don't take it too
serious.  If I wanted serious I could put in more overtime.
