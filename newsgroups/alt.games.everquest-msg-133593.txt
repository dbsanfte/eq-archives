If you grope a woman under the age of 18, you may be in jail. If she's
older, you might just get slapped if she's not inclined to press
charges.

To your question: The xp will be split *roughly* in a direct ratio to
the levels of the member of the group. (I say "roughly" because the
ShowEQ users insist there's a modifier to add in, and I'm sure there is,
but for purposes of your question, this works fine.)

If you are level 40 and your partner is level 60, you'll get 40/100 or
40 percent of the xp per kill, and the higher level player will get
60/100, or 60 percent of the xp per kill. If the mob is green to the
sixty, his/her xp will just get thrown out, and you'll still only get
40% of the xp awarded on that kill. (You don't always divide by one
hundred. That just happened to be the total levels in your two person
group. Add up the levels of all members to get the number to divide by.)

Of course, there are group bonus considerations to throw in, zone
experience modifiers, etc. etc. etc. but that only affects the total xp
that the mob will be worth and doesn't really relate to your question.
It's pretty much a straight "by the level" split. Add up the total
levels in the party and divide that number into your level, and that's
the percentage of the xp per kill (for full blue mobs and above) that
you will get.
