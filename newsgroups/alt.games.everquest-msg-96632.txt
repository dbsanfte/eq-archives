Speaking as a dad with two 'halflings' of his own, the last time I tried to
sing along with Bert to "Doing the Pigeon" I dislocated my left pinky-toe.
Then when my oldest explained that "The Alphabet Song", "Baa-Baa Black
Sheep", and "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" are all the same music I had to go
sit in a dark quiet room with a damp cloth on my forehead.  If  EQ is
getting this tough, maybe its time to bring Chutes and Ladders down from the
gameroom closet.
