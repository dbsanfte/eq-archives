Kobold camps in Toxx. They're all below level 5, IIRC. Stand in the
middle of one, crank up your DDD song with a horn, and leave your
character there overnight. No one camps them, by the time you're of
the level to have the song, they die before they can do more than a
few points of damage to you, and they all spawn close enough to be hit
by the song. You shouldn't die or even be in danger of it doing this.
Also, by the time you come back in the morning, your brass should be
maxxed and possibly your faction. :-p
