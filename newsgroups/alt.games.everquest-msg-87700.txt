Yeah, healing would be the weak area with this foursome, although you
do have the bard's healing song for downtime.  Could swap the warrior
for a pally, I suppose.

When you get to upper levels though you're going to want a cleric, not
only for healing but for res.

I just think the "warrior, cleric, enchanter, druid"-type group
doesn't generate enough damage and rogues are awesome at that.

Warrior, cleric, bard, druid might work, what with all the helpful
combat songs the bard can play...
