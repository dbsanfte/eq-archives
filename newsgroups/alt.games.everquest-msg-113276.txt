I'm sorry, you seem to be under the impression that you're ENTITLED to
a SoW just because you're asking nicely.  Doesn't work that way.

It's someones time.  Time to cast the spell and time to med it back
up.  Even a piddly 40 mana.  Did you offer to make it worth anybodies
time?  Offer a donation of a plat?  Offer 5pp and you'll get a SoW
within a minute or so I'd bet.

And I never understood the NEED for SoW.  I mean, my druid and my
ranger feel naked without it, but my warrior has traveled ALL over
Norrath without it.  Same goes for my level 17 enchanter AND my level
15 rogue.  I even ran a level 5 monk from Qeynos to Innothule Swamp
WITHOUT SoW, no problem.  SoW is nice, but generally speaking, not
necessary at all.

Obviously there are others who hold a different opinion.

Please.  This is hardly anything to bitch about.  I find the druids
that don't understand the concept of controlling your pulls MUCH more
of an embarrassment.

I have no problems SoWing people who ask for it, even the "sow plz"
contingent, as long as they're standing right in front of me and I'm
not currently busy.  It's people that think that they DESERVE SoW that
tend to honk my hooter more than anything.
