This happened to me with the Catalyst 4.4 drivers I believe.  (And only 
in EQ.)

Download the newest Catalyst drivers, uninstall your current drivers and 
reboot, then install the newest Catalyst drivers.

Personally I use the Omega version of the Catalyst drivers, found at 
http://www.omegadrivers.net/

That should fix your keyboard problem.  If not, then dunno :p
