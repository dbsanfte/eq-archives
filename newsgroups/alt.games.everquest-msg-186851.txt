Note that 'too close' is a relative term. If you're threateningly to
the Claws of Veeshan faction in Velious, 'too close' to Wuoshi in
Wakening lands is as soon as she pops up at the edge of your screen.
She sits right on the druid circle too. It is for these reasons that
she is often called Woahshit, because if you're KOS that's what you
say when you first see her. The second thing you see after her is
usually 'loading, please wait'.
