You know, it's amazing how hostile the people in this newsgroup are,
when you blow off a little steam (and not even in a way that I think
was too offensive to anyone here, or even Verant).

I'm just continually shocked at all the responses I get that call
into question my abilities and intelligence.  I expect this kind of
behavior from advocacy newsgroups...but here?  I was hoping EQ was
a community which extended to this particular usenet newsgroup.

You know, everyone sharing ideas, experiences, helping each other to
a reasonable degree.  Not implying that people are stupid, incompetent,
and "surely would not be part of MY team".  When people I know vent
frustration, I express a bit of sympathy and then offer help, or don't
comment at all.  I don't tell them they're stupid.

Thanks to everyone who gave constructive criticism.  To the rest,
same back at you.  I'll go back to "lurk mode" here and won't
bother to post anymore.  Too many of you are just WAY too mean and
aggressive for me to want to get frustrated and offended by you.

Enjoy your life, Mr. Jekke.  I'm sure you hire only the BEST of
programmers.

-Ed
