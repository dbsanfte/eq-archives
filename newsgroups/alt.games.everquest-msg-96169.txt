As you might imagine you can only go back to your old server.

They don't want Legends being a way to circumvent rules they have
of no item transfers between servers. This is even why on legends they
may delay your xfer for up to 6 months or possibly not allow an item
to be moved if for example:

You have a char from solusek ro on legends with a rubicte bp and a
manastone.

You have a char from a newer blue server on legends which never had a
rubicite bp
and a manastone. (as in the server never had those at all)

You have the character from solusek give those items to the character 
on the newer blue server, where they don't exist.

You then try to get transferred back to the old servers.
