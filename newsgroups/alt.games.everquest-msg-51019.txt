Yea, but this is'nt lag causing this.  I've ran EQ on Windows 2k for months
and months and nothing ever happened.  But now that I think of it, I was
using the nVidia 21.80 drivers then.  When I did a fresh install of 9x I
installed the 21.83 drivers.  I will try to find the 21.80's and install
those again.  Maybe that will fix it.  I'll post again to inform anyone who
cares.
