 Once you start taking on some of the more Uber mobs that like to
dispell you will see the advantage of insta-cast buffs. For everyday
travelling use TBoots or Sow potions are good enough if not better. I'm
sure nobody is disagreeing with that. However, against mobs that dispell
the top buff, JBoots are the item to have since you don't need them
equipped. There are others like the grachnist earring and such but in
most cases I think those have to be worn.
