Hmm don't know what you base that on. Most people I know would prefer
it that way. It would mean you'd not have to wait in line anymore
since this blue con mob to you had the same chance for good loot as
this other blue con mob. Plus it would make more game world sense, I
mean this giant over here is obviously a successful monster so it
would make sense that he dropped an fbss once. 

Most mmorpgs coming out are doing this in fact in some way or another.
Its called increasing randomness. Star wars galaxies is doing it for
instance, when you kill the "nest" of some creatures over here some
new type of creature will be there later so there is more randomness
and less camping. It might have some certain mobs who drop certain
better stuff or are more static, not sure but overall the new order is
randomness. iF done right it would keep the game fresher.
