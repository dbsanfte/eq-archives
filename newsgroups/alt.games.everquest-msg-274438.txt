Like some of the other respondents, I agree that it's probably a good thing 
for you to be out of that guild. I can't imagine anyone in a guild described 
as "adult" having a problem with calling a *mob* a "bastard". Sheesh. Sounds 
like someone was being way too sensitive. Maybe this was just a pretense for 
some other reason they wanted you out of the guild? That's often what drives 
seemingly arbitrary moves.

And although there are plenty of leaders I've known with whom I would have 
felt perfectly comfortable saying "bite me", it doesn't appear that you knew 
this one well enough to take that risk, so you'd probably be best holding 
off doing this in the future (even with the emote) until you're confident 
you know the person better. ;-)

Good luck finding a more suitable guild. They are out there.
