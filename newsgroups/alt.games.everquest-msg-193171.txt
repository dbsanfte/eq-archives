Dual boxed monk and druid can fight at any of the spots in velks, get good
exp while doing it. Or you can invis and jsut spam the zone "looking for
threads", usually most groups will let people come loot them.

As for DSP and shards... same occurs in many zones where people exp. Skeles
in Grey, Scouts in ME etc... Don't blame the players. You do not know the
sheer anger and frustration of Lucid Shard camps. Sucks if they are KSing
people. I generally just bribed groups. 500pp finders fee, send me a tell
when it drops.. that way they carry on exping happily and I get the shard
when it dropped.

You could always kill the hoppers in Mons Letalis. arctic wyvern hide
tailoring is useless for skill ups.
