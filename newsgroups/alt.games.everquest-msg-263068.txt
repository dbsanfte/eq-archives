I learned long ago not to underestimate the incompetence of
random_player_01.  I just hope that they will be ignorant but
educable newbs, rather than obstinate self-righteous jerks.
Interestingly, the same person can easily be both, had a Wiz
in a group recently who completely failed to respond to the
Clerics passionate but rude insistence that she snare lest we
wipe.  I sent her a tell explaining what we needed in more
gentle terms, she replied with a question/request of her own,
and the problem quickly evaporated.  Moral:  Don't treat your
groupmates the way I have been known to treat posters to this
newsgroup when annoyed.  ;)
