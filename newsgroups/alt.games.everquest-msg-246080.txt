Forgot to tell about an incident at the end of my vacation (well, early
Monday afterwards). Dead tired at 2 am, I'm about to log in PoK when someone
ooc's "Open raid on the ogres of Oggok!" This was something I had been
wanting to look into: how tough were the mobs in the cities? I had seen some
evil characters fighting guards in Felwithe and expected to do the same with
my SK someday. I wanted to know how worthwhile it was, and what better
chance to do it than with a raid force at my back?

  I waited an hour while the organizers recruited more for the raid. Finally
satisfied with their numbers, we headed into the Feerott. The bouncers the
the entrance were pathetically easy. Inside the city they weren't much
tougher. They were all green to me, of course, but survived Ice Comets well
enough...once or twice.
However, they had high resistances - I needed to use lures to do reliable
damage. Not good for a pure caster, but an SK might find it a good camp. One
of the guards poofed on us when a ranger performed a FATAL BOW SHOT!
Interesting form of crowd control, that.
  Then we pulled Exterminator Glurg. This guy is apparently classed as a
merchant, and a rather tough one. His hit point regen was phenomenal; even
after we debuffed him, he seemed to have a tremendous amount of HP, at least
hunderds of thousands, I wouldn't be surprised if it were a full million. It
took fifteen minutes to whittle him down to nothing. The ranger who
performed the fatal bow shot earlier kept getting them, sometimes singly,
sometimes in chans, but they didn't seem to make Glurg's health fall any
faster; immune to instant death, they couldn't do regular damage to him.
  Naturally, Glug dropped the same trash the other guards did. At that
point, I decided Ada didn't need to see more, and got some much-needed
sleep.
