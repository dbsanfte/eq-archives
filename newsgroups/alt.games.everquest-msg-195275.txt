Yeah, I can do significant damage with or without KEI on a particular fight,
starting from FM.  (Not as significant as you'd think just looking at the
nukes, though, because of resists.  E.g., at level 55 in a place like, say,
Halls of Testing, I've got to go pretty much exclusively with lures, which
are only 2 to 1 ratio (better if I've got Mage focus items)).

The difference KEI makes is on the *next* fight or two.  Without KEI, during
most of a raid, my choices are one or two nukes per mob, which doesn't do a
lot of damage, or several nukes, which makes a fair contribution to that
fight, but leaves me low enough on mana that I've got to sit out a fight or
two.

With KEI, I can make a reasonable contribution to nearly every fight, and
keep enough mana in reserve for emergencies, like helping quickly take down
an add or something.

For the serious player, with great equipment and plenty of AA points, it's
less of a difference--those Wizards can do some amazing things, but for the
casual 55 Wizard, it is a big difference.
