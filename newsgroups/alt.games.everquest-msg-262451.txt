And I do agree with you, I hate slogging through several screens 
of crap to get to the new parts, but since the convention *is* 
bottom posting on this particular list, and they asked me 
politely to please bottom post I complied. The lists I am on with 
top posting, I top post=)

*I top posted as long as they bitched the fuck at me, but one 
person politely asked me to comply after about 8 months and I 
did. You think this polite asking is rough on you - try having 
people 'yelling' invective at you to force you to change to 
comply. This is positivly sweetness and light. I look upon it as 
positive social engineering =) We also now have a FAQ, and a lot 
more politeness evident than just a year ago. Now if we could 
just get rid of the obscene picture spammers=\
