Good point.  Though even so, players had better know where their servers
are merging (if theirs is the one losing its name) in order to find their
characters afterward.

Speaking of which, I'd like to do a quick doublecheck to make sure
I'm not leaving anything to rot in the mergers, but I don't want to
spend a lot of time at it.  I've seen people remark that EQIM is a
fast way to check lots of servers to see where you've got characters
languishing.  I've never used EQIM, though.  How do I run it?  Is it
a separate app I need to install, or is it accessed through the
"chat" button on the login screen, or what?
