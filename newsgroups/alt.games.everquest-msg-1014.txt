My experience of SolA is not extensive, as I've only been in there to try
and get a Heart of Fire (and still haven't succeeded!), but here's my
thoughts anyway.

If you can get into the shaman room intact (a tricky proposition in SolA as
everything is aggro and all the casters see invis), then maybe (i.e. item
c). You'd have to break the spawn and keep the nearby area clear, but if you
can manage that without dying and have time to heal and/or med up before the
next wandering mobs drops by, then you might be able to do it.

Of course, it'd be far easier if you had a higher level friend, preferably
with a pet - a level 52 mage helped me out in SolA trying to get a heart,
and he cleared out the entire southern section (one bit at a time) without
too much trouble (although I died once due to the fact I was all lagged to
hell).
