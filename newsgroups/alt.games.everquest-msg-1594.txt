Same druid, one zone over, different prey for a while last night.  Good
pp, few nice items, two blue bubbles of hell.  This is soloing a Half
Elf druid with a sub 100 Wis stat to answer any twinky questions, hehe. 
I wasn't complaining about Velious, just the fact that I was stupid
enough to try applying logic to a fantasy game.  Just because that derv
was made of snow is no reason to assume I can melt him with fire.  Sure
to us it makes sense that fire melts ice, but what if this is a case of
ice cooling my fire <G>.  Its all good, I learned not to play with the
snow dervs.  Thats what its all about, not winning every battle, but
figuring out which battles to fight.
