True, but I really didn't get entangled in his story too much. I usually
play a rogue so I didn't need him. The one time I *did* try a wizard the
fairy lasted until the next level when I could pick a new familiar and Tomi
lasted until the next level when I quit and rolled a new character.

The idea that Bill Gates has appeared like a knight in shining armor to
lead all his customers out of a mire of technological chaos neatly ignores
the fact that it was he who by peddling second-hand, second-rate
technology, led them all into it in the first place.
--Douglas Adams Author, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
