Yeah, AC is low priority around 35 or so. But it is good both before and
after that. 

As an enchanter, getting your AC up to a meaningful level means not just
being able to kill the high end velious mobs that drop 35 ac all/all
gear, it means being in a guild where all the main tanks already have
that kind of kit.

But with that, and stuff like the AC 60 robe from ToV north wing, an
enchanter can hit what most people consider to be the AC cap (1200), and
so be pretty much as hard a target as a cleric.
