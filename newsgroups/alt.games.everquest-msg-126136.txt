You can max alchemy with all storebought components too.  I agree, Verant
should seriously look into alchemy.  There are a lot of alchemy recipes, and
most of them are completely useless, many of the ones that are useful are
rediculously expensive.  Once I hit level 60, I will likely max out alchemy,
but I probably will not bother getting over 100 before that.
