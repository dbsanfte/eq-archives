Wouldn't do it if I was you as it is listed as an exploit and when you seen
doing it, you char will be nerfed.

PS: many people just petition now a days when they see people doing it too,
why? Coz ya can kill the soulbinder... and its a pain in the butt for users
trying to get that bind when someone is cheating and has killed it.
