This is all true, if you have a limited spawn rate, but if you're so
overpowering that you are waiting on spawn, you should probably move to a
better spot.  In the better dungeons, a full group of the appropriate
level can kill a lot more than 6 times the mobs that a soloer could
handle in the same amount of time.  A 36-42 group in the lower guk can
take the cav/sav/exe/sage spawns and all wanderers pretty well, which is 5
named (if you include the scribe), 15 regular mobs, and about 8 wanderers
every 30 minutes, compared to a soloer pulling one, maybe 2 of them every
30 minutes.  
The idea is to find the places where you can clear out your room but
still be close enough to other places to pull enough to keep everyone
busy.  With the extra experience bonus to certain dungeons, this will
open up all sorts of new areas to do the exp grind.  Finally, I won't
have to sit at the ridge in Dreadlands to get boring safe exp.

Crawled Crystal Caverns last night, most stuff was green, but found a
great room for exp, no maps though
