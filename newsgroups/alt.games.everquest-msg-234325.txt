I picked up VP1 right after Cann5 but waited much too long before
going for VP3. I was kicking myself for waiting so long (bought at
around 100AA) once I'd had it for a few days. It might not be all that
useful to a raiding or soloing shaman but as someone who groups with
friends pretty much exclusively it's proved to be invaluable.
Expecially since I usually end up doing most of the crowd control in
our groups. It's also great for playing Cleric golf! <g>
