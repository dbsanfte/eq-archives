I don't think so.  I killed a lot of Kejekan tigers as well as the other
types of (4 legged) cats in the zone, with no faction messages.  And the 2
legged cats still con indifferent.

On a side note, be careful of the named gorilla.  I hear he takes faction
with the cats down something like an entire faction level per kill.
