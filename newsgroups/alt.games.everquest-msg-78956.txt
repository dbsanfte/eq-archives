David, thanks, been there done that, last night with Xytl's pet!! Died about
5 times! Someone (can't recall the name just now) was very helpful in
getting Darklet out of the water. Every single time I went back in, trying
to get my corpse, I died again. Not to drowning, to Xytl's pet. I'm gonna
make his ass SUFFER when I do get old enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
