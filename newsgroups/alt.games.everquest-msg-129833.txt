Yeah.  I know it gets better...   it's just seriously disappointing now.
Canni 1 gives back so little mana I can barely tell I cast it.  (Casting regen
on myself is much more noticable movement in the mana bar. : /)

I have however seen what level 60 shamans can do with Canni 4 (or 5, the AA
one) and torpor.

Shaman_01 says "OOM!"

*Canni 6 times*
*torpor*
*Canni 6 times*
*torpor*

Shaman_01 says "90 mana."

Cleric_01 says "I hate you Shaman_01"
