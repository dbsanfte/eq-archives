Merchant price means little because merchants usually buy very low and
sell very high -- fine steel weapons are sold to merchants for 5 plat
but the merchants will charge 65 platinum for the same weapons.
Merchants will pay silver for spider silks but players will pay
several platinum for those same silks.  Another example, NPC merchants
will pay much more for a Giant Grub Digger than for an Axe of the
Ironback but no player would ever buy the Grub Digger since the Axe of
the Ironback is a better weapon.  (Few players would fight using an
Axe of the Ironback these days, but that's another story.) 

The way to make money, aside from killing mobs that drop  lots of
coin, is to sell in the bazaar the items that sell well and to sell to
merchants the junk.  Knowing what's junk and what's a hot bazaar item
is part of the game -- and, bizarre as it may seem, there are as many
who deliberately over-price as there are those who slash prices to
unload the items so they can get more to sell.
