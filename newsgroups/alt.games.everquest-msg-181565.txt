Yeah... that's kinda how I knew exactly where it drops you ;) One of our
guildies (small, casual player guild, in our 30's at the time) ran in to
join the rest of us, and plummetted straight down to his death. Took the
rest of us many hours to do the CR. At one point we all jumped straight
down while levved... except, um, I forgot to cast Illusion Air
elemental. "No problem", thought I, "I seem to be ok gliding down on the
backs of my friends below me." Except when I got to the bottom, even
though I had floated down on the back of a levved char, I died anyway :)
Was a crazy night, but really fun (except when our ranger went LD
outside the runelord room and couldn't come back on before the evac
out...). Actually, the whole story would do best under the "funnest
moments" thread...
