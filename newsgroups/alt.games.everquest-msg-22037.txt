The word "kitty" is not an adjective and for those who want it to be one
(Taras), what does it mean?
As Dark Tyger points out below, it is a noun.
It is merely another word for cat, thus making Kitty Cat (Kat) a compound
name, Not a phrase...
Besides, an adjective and noun together don't necessarily make a phrase; For
example:
"Blue Dog" is not a phrase.
