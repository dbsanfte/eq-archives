Thanks for the info.
I also tried the newbie option, but no-one seemed interested in WFP,
EC and GF.  I was offering 5pp a stack, but no takers.  I didn't want
to kill them myself, depriving newbies of exp (and I think it's a bit
sad to see a L40 ranger swatting at bats hehe).

I /ooc'ed looking for a vendor, but no-one replied :(

Again, thanks for the information - I'm in the Dreadlands now so I
guess I'll have to make the ones I have do until I get back to
civilisation :)
