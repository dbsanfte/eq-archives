Uh, dude that's CGI, like most games use in cut scenes.. Like Warcraft 3
etc... In fact it might be part of the EQ2 intro movie to the game, but I'm
guessing you probably just skipped right past that...? BTW whoever made that
intro movie did a very good job... I'm not sure but I think it can be
downloaded from places like www.fileplanet.com for those that don't have the
game...
