Back when the zone first opened, a guild did a raid and attacked the source.
The rough total of hit points was close to one million and it took them
several hours to kill. I believe that it also hit them back for small
damages like 5 to 15 points each hit. Sorry I don't remember the guild name
but I remember the GM broadcasting on Terris-Thule that a guild was the
first to kill it. No loot was dropped and they were VERY disappointed in
that. I think somewhere on the Everlore site there is a description of the
event.
