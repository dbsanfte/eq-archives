You don't mention what you're using in your off-hand, however, for a cheap,
decent combo, I'd say a Lamentation (9/19) in main hand and a Centi LS
(14/27) in off hand.  Main hand, lower delay is better, thus the Lamentation
is an excellent choice here for this, off hand is ratio dependent, thus the
Centi LS is superior here.

Another superiority feature of the Lamentation or Centi LS is that they've
both got nice Str/Sta bonuses on them, which helps keep you over 100 sta if
you swap out some armor for higher ac pieces without stamina on it.

Basically , Wurmslayers are crap, yeah, they give you big hits for a
1hander, but you're taking a serious DPS hit for some dick-waving rights.

If you're more inclined to spending money (and being WAY over-aggro'd  =P),
a Club of the Ice Ocean is also good for off-hand, it has the same ratio as
the Centi LS, plus a 149 pt cold DD, only downside is that you can't equip
it until 51.  Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood is also a decent weapon that
would raise your DPS nicely, (11/24, 85 pt poison DD), an added bonus to the
Venomous Axe is that it has 10 ac on it.

If you're more money limited, a simple Dragon Horn Ykesha (8/23, 75pt magic
DD/stun)  would do to replace your Wurmslayer, although the proc is nice to
stun casters, it does have more agro to it than without the stun component.

Also, all these suggestions assume that you've been keeping your weapon
skills up, since the club of the ice ocean is 1hb and the dragon horn ykesha
is piercing (1h).
