Wow, really thought about this one, and there are a ton of them. Let's 
see...

1) My husband teaching me how to use /tell, telling me the thou shalts 
and thou shalt nots of interacting with other players, and leaving me to 
figure the rest out on my own.

2) Dying. Dying often, and having no idea where my corpse was. After a 
few times of helping me find my carcass, my husband also taught me how 
to use /loc =)

3) Another player watching me slug it out with the critters in the 
Freeport yard for a while, then giving me a backpack full of gear to 
use. The stuff he gave me probably wouldn't be worth 5pp in the bazaar 
today, but I was sooo grateful. Anything beat my uber newbie shirt and 
dagger.

4) Outgrowing the FP stuff and graduating to EC, and being overwhelmed 
by the chatter since that was the barter zone on our server. Also in EC, 
I distinctly remember my first wisp. No magic weapons, and I was no 
match for it anyway, so back to Freeport I went. I knew the loc of my
corpse, though!

5) Getting my rogue lost in the tunnels under Freeport and finding out 
that the drowned citizens weren't nice at all.

6) Moving up to the big leagues, WC to be exact, and never straying out 
of sight of the guards at the tollbooth. It felt so very far from home, 
and I was chicken. Spotting some guy standing just a bit out of my 
comfort zone and wandering closer...and meeting Kizdean Gix for the 
first time. *sigh* Back to Freeport. I still kill Gix every time I'm 
anywhere near the zone, and it's still a nice feeling.

7) My husband's bard taking me on a field trip from Freeport to Qeynos. 
Wow, that was a looong run, and the whole thing was a bit spooky. The 
Karanas were infected with some sort of illness or plague at the time, 
and the first time I saw the "You feel sick" text it freaked me out.

8) Going to Oasis and learning what "Specs to zone" meant, lol.

9) Going to Kelthin for the first time and loving the cool tree houses, 
then promptly running off of one of the platforms and learning about 
fall damage.

10) Seeing Quillmane for the first time. My husband was sitting across 
the room at his desk and looked over when I said, "Oh cool, a pegasus!" 
One of his friends, who played a mage, was more than happy to hear that 
Quill was up, but didn't make it there before someone else killed 
him/her. It was still pretty exciting to have accidentally found such an 
"important" creature.

There are a lot more, but those are the top 10 early memories.

My first two characters were definitely leveled at a slow pace, and my 
husband encouraged me to be a tourist, see the sights, and learn my way 
around. Now, though, any new alts follow a very predictable pattern of 
zones to at least level 45, then I sometimes start exploring a bit again.
