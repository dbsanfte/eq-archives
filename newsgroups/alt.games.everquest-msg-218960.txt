Did you miss the part about the mana pool maximum dropping while
the buff was up?  Think about this in the context of KEI...  If
KEI worked this way, any given enchanter may only be able to KEI
five people before his mana pool maximum was zero.

The no-upper-time-limit-buffs would have a pretty big downside...
If the downside were properly balanced...  I don't see why it
wouldn't work.  Another potential adjustment to making it work
would be that the buffer and buffee would need to stay in the same
zone.

Another potential adjustment is building on something you said in
your post, perhaps have this technique only work with groupmates.

As far as "buff twinking" is concerned, I think that is a separate
issue entirely...  If some spells are too powerful to be cast on
lower level people, the fix is to make the spells not stick, not
to nerf buff duration.  Though I do agree with you that some spells
stick too long.

In any case I don't think you've given the idea proper thought,
at least your reply doesn't seem very complete.  Some elaboration
would be nice.
