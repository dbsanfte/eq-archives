I have a set, and I would like to throw caution into the wind to anybody
considering buying these.

I got the wireless ones, and while it looks great while playing, they
1) tend to give me a hell of a headache after wearing them for about 20
minutes or so (and same with my husband).
and
2) are peripherals, which cause a LOT of problems on some people's
computers.  They worked on mine, but I got "the blue screen o' death" a few
times... and yes, I know it was -because- of them.

If you have Windows 2k pro, they're a pain in the ass to set up, as well.
