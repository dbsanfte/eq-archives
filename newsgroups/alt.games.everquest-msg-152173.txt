Something else to consider is how they hunt.

Wizards only have a few options.

Solo:
Run and nuke (modified for quad kiting later on)
Root and nuke.
Nuke and die.

Also, most of these options don't work indoors in general.

Group:
Crappy DS (5 pt at level 60)
Snare
Root CC
Nuke
Die ;)
Evac

Druids on the other hand...

Solo:
Run and nuke (also modified for quad kiting later in life)
Root and nuke (ehh... not that you'd want to)
Root and dot
Run and dot
Charm and slaughter
DS/regrowth up and melee (porcupine) (yes, this is even viable post-50, I do
it myself at times for exp, albeit light blue)

Some of these actually work nicely indoors, root/dot, charm and porcupine in
particular.

Group:
Nuke
Dot
Heal
Decent DS (34 at 60 with ancient, 32 otherwise, 40 at 64)
Snare
Root CC
Charm CC (limited, but still there)
Evac
Regen
AC/HP buff
STR buff
ATK buff (share wolf form)
SoW/SoE
