Personally, that wouldn't stop me if my tradeskill society felt more like "a
group of people" and less of "a place to craft". More like a guild, so to
speak.

Maybe, if the society had a chat channel and web site, it would be possible
to do the necessary team-building. There could also be some benefits or
titles for those with highest rank to incite people to compete.

As it is now, I think most people don't even realize the potential in
fulfilling society orders. I know I didn't, until I asked on a crafting
channel.
