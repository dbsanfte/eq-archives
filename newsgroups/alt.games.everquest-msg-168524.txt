I believe mechanized lockpicks (also tinkered, but the rarest drop involved 
is a rat ear, heh) also have 3%.  Might be 2%, but close enough. :)

From the Safehouse FAQ:

Question: What Picklock skills are required to open common doors in
norrath?
                          
Answer:
Befallen Floors 1-3: 11
Freeport door for Burning Rapier: 122
Karnor's, Howling Stones, City of Mist: 200
Sebilis, NFP Bank Door: 201
Veeshans Peak: 210

I believe the hole is pathetically low skill, suprised it's not listed.
