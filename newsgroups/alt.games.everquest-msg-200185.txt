Sorry, I never noticed that change...ok so there were less players than
before but the place became a P/L zone so a 60+ could help a 50+ level.
Velks is one of those places I visit rarely because I know I'll never stay
too long...There is rarely anything more self centered and ignorant in the
game than one of the Top Teir Guilds P/L someones Alt because they need more
of that class.

Velks, IME, was the next stage to to the LoIO, OT, DL, KC route.
