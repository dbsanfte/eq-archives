I suspect the real reason for the recent "quiz" is to determine if
there's enough of a market to bother pressing an alternate DVD version
at all, or not.

Either way they're still going to be putting out a box-o-CDs version,
for sure -- DVD-ROM drives just aren't ubiquitous enough yet.

Or they've decided to do both and just want estimates of what
proportion of each to press.
