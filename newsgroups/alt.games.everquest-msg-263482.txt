Yet it happens all the time.   Data flow is trivial to screw up in
modular systems.   We use messengers which only read XML
specs at startup, for instance -- guess what happens when you
don't restart the messengers after changing a module and adding
an XML element needed by another application?   The CODE
may be *perfect* but still have "support" issues.   Beta is when
those issues are worked out, of course.

It's still a module.  Take out crafting and you still have a perfectly
workable game.   All those other factors are just data flow.

There's simply no indication of that.

Then talk about those issues, not the ones where there are perfectly
valid reasons for what's happening.   Beta testing on something like
EQII can be easily (and best!) accomplished in phases -- adding
components during beta testing doesn't mean ANYTHING other
than they were added during beta testing rather than at rollout.
