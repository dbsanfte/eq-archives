OK, what I meant was, bandit *groups* are usually a good 4 or 5 levels
higher than them, because they range in level from like, 15 to 20-something,
so a group of level 20-somethings do not want a 15 Rogue.

But it's all good because I got bound in Shadow Haven and found a group at
the bandit camp and made two levels.
