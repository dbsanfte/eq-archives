If the attrition in the raiding guilds on my server is any indication
then yes, population is down a lot. Of the 8 or so post elemental guilds
that were on Tarew Marr pre-expansion, half can't field a raid force
most days. Two were considering merging, one barely has 15 on in peak
hours, and one has officially disbanded. In my own guild, we've lost a
lot of people, but have been fortunate enough to pick up a number of
recruits from the other guilds who were in worse shape than us. Even
with that we have a hard time filling a raid in ikkinz or getting enough
clerics on to do Uqua dispite coming very close to beating it last try.

In the general population, one indicator could be bazaar mules.
While formerly, I never saw the number of mules drop below 350-450 except
right after a patch, now typically I see mid 200's traders in the bazaar
in prime time.
