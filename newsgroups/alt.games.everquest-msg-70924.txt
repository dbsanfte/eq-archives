I didn't activate my DAoC account after the free month because (as far as
the PvE element is concerned):

(1) There are no new zones to explore as you level.
(2) Soloing is trivially easy, and death (when it rarely occurs) is
painless. There is no challenge, and hence no sense of achievement.
(3) No grand set-piece encounters to look forward too.
(4) Dull dungeons.

In all, I found DAoC to be very denatured after a fairly short time. There's
nothing in DAoC to compare with that first, heart-in-mouth low-level run
from Qeynos to Freeport, for instance, or the sheer terror of escaping from
a LGuk ghoul train. Blandness pervades.
