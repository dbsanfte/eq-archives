You will NEVER hear that from me.

I love grouping with Enchanters. Sure I have a limited ability to MEZ,
HASTE, and CHARM, but I know who the real masters are (/em bows to
Enchanters). Grouping with an Ench means I can concentrate on Slows,
Resists, DoTs, Snares, Buffs, and Clarity songs (which stack nicely
with the spells).

Bards are the hardest working players in EQ (twisting for hours is
murder). We are great at filling in the gaps in a group, but a smart
Bard will always defer to the class with the better tools.
