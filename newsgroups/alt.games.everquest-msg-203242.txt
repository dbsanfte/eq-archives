Yeah, and every monk at that level realized it within about the first 5
seconds after engaging their first PoP mob.

Sony knew it too, but their stated reason for the nerf and the *real* reason
for the nerf were extremely different, and they apparently don't mind the
ill will that generates among the playerbase (particularly those playing
monks that are smart enough, and it doesn't take much smarts, to figure out
the real reason for the nerf).

But then, they couldn't exactly say "Too many of you started monk twinks, so
we're gonna make the class suck for a while to get some of you to switch to
twinks we think the game needs more of".
