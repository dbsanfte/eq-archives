Oddly enough, I turned on this feature, noticed how shadows were very
2D.  (Always the same direction, lighting had nothing to do with the angle)
And when I went to see if I could see my own shadow it wasn't there.

Now, I might have some clipping stopping me from seeing my own shadow,
but I thought it was funny that "no, no its still just me".
