Also if you a not avert to a small bit of twinking and have the ability then
grab a couple of velium fire wedding bands to get you through the low
levels. It will proberly set you back 900pp for the pair but the resulting
130 extra HP will mean you can wade in and absorb a black eye more often to
preserve your fragile pet at the baby levels.

Once you have leveled up and get pets which aren't so fragile you always
have the option of selling the them again for the same price you brought
them for very easily, they move like hotcakes in the bazaar.
