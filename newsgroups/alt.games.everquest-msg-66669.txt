RE: load problems
have just 1 server here for a my characters but it seems we all as a group
of players have 1 of  3 effects of late with SoL. 1) crash to desk top when
swapping characters or zoning. 2) your problem with not getting it to load
properly or 3) crash to desk top between character selection and zoning to
the realm. have done multiple reloads and clearly too many ppl are having
problems with this issue for it to be mere chance.
