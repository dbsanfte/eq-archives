Caveat to that though with a anecdote.

I went down to Lguk to camp a bard friend of mine a mask of deception (he
had lost his corpse a few months ago and quit the game for a while, so we
were getting him re-equipped).  Show up at camp, nothing is spawned, but no
one in room except a level 23 rogue hiding in the corner.  He claims it was
his camp and he was letting other people pull it so he could get a mask.
The guy clearing the room for the rogue doesn't care and lets us take the
room, so the rogue starts shouting and whining that we stole his camp.
Moron.  At least it was entertaining to pull wizzy frogs and get him AE
snared since he stayed in the room for another 3 hours or so after we moved
in.

You can't be forced to share with someone who can't handle the camp, or if
you are, just wait 5 minutes til they die.
