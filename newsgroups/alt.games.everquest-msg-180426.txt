I was hoping someone could help me out with Xnews. I cannot figure out how 
to perform a simple search. I select Group -> Find from the menu and type 
in keyword(s) for which to search, and nothing happens. I have tried very 
basic keywords, such as "iksar" to no avail. Is there some trick to 
searching in Xnews?
