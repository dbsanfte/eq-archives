While level 53's cant kill Vox they CAN buff the crap out of
everyone and make a very good "giant cover" squad. When I help
my lower level friends thats exactly what we do - 60 rng, 60 dru,
60 clr, 60 enc, 60 mnk. Pull as much of the lair and annhilate
it as we can before we get Vox's free evacs (also handy, actually,
if Vox is still up and you get too many by mistake ;) she's friendly
like that), buff everyone, then proceed to slaughter anything that
pops while the fight goes on. The stunned looking little casters
who repop are generally pretty grateful.
