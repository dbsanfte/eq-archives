Ah ok, i just got that today actually with a warrior as a guide. We
had one group with 3 tanks, me (druid 55), warrior 60 (was one of
those 3 tanks) enchanter 46 (seemed plenty high) and a cleric 54. 
It was easy and no one died or came close. The warrior knew the way
and I really could not detail it here. 

We were killing the squallsurge and what not seahorses and mermaids
who spawned on us also. We were about to leave after an hour or so
when the tainted spawned ;). I guess there its always the corrupted
when the tainted dies so that is nice. We smoked the tainted and still
were doing okay on  the corrupted. We had inivs getting there but
still had to stop and fight some stuff here and there.. such as
Estrella jumped us on the way (killed her, 2 of the lamentation 2 hand
blades that kinda suck now with velious) 

You probably need a map or someone like this warrior who had done the
exact same thing before.
