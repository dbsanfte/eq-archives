Greets,

I have found the following settings work best for the cards listed
below (All settings done under the new "Options" button):

3dfx VooDoo5 (64mb)
Dynamic LIghting = OFF (If turned "on" there is a constant "stutter"
when running in all zones)
Mip Mapping = OFF
Sound = ON
Social Animations = ON
Texture Quality = High
Resolution = 1024x768
All character models selected except for; Erudites, Iksar (I hate the
new models for these races)

ATI Radeon 32DDR
Dynamic Lighting = OFF
Mip Mapping = ON
Sound = ON
Social Animations = ON
Texture Quality = Medium
Resolution = 1024x768

ATI Radeon 8500 (64mb)
Dynamic Lighting = ON
Mip Mapping = ON
Sound = ON
Social Animations = ON
Texture Quality = High
Resolution = 1024x768

System tested on:

AMD 900 Athlon
512mb PC133 SDRAM
Iwill KK266 (Via KT133A) Motherboard
Phillips Acoustic Edge Sound Card
Linksys 10/100 Network Card
Win98SE
Win2000 SP2
DirectX 8.1
Via4in1 v4.35

From my observations "Dynamic Lighting" causes a HUGE performance hit
when turned on. "Texture Quality" seems to only be a problem if you
have a video card with 32mb or less onboard memory. "Mip Mapping"
didn't seem to have any effect at all on the ATI cards, but turning it
off really helped to smooth out the VD5.

I hope my this information is useful.

Good Luck!
