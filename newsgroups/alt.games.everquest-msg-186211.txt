You know, I'm glad that I at least amuse people with repetitions of 
conversations I have.  It makes it easier to not kill random people when 
I can at least get a laugh out of it ;)

Here's another sampling:

The scenario: pulling to a ruin in DL.  Two pulls.  Chanter *fears* 
both.  We quickly kill to avoid adds.  More pulls.  Chanter fears 
*again*.  After third time, one melee finally says "uh why are we 
fearing?" and at that point other melees join in with "let's NOT fear" 
etc etc.  Chanter explains that she's "saving the cleric from spending 
so much mana".  Explaining that shoving many scared mobs into the middle 
of a field of many not-scared mobs is not a good way to 'save the cleric 
mana' results in a grumpy "fine then, if you don't want to save the 
cleric some work, I won't fear."

There was a necro in a group a couple days later who did the same thing.  
Wanna make your melees scream?  Send the thing they're handling 
perfectly well heading for the hills and it's friends and leave them 
standing there with hearts pounding while their poor slow melee brains 
go "run the fuck away and zone and let the fearer deal with the mess, or 
try and kill before they get anywhere?"

Oh, and then there was the monk that was pulling to another ruin, who 
dragged us all into the middle of the field FULL of mobs and explained 
that the chanter was going to mez all the mobs that wandered by (ALL the 
mobs!!!!!) and the cleric was going to heal, and we'd just keep killing.  
This lasted until the chanter very quickly got down to 15% mana, at 
which point the monk said "okay, back to ruins to med!", which we did, 
only mez broke, chanter couldn't get the mobs under control again, aggro 
transferred badly to the cleric, cleric died, and the only reason the 
rest of us lived was that a 55 druid was passing by and healed us while 
we kept fighting - found out it was because our nice little chanter had 
earlier saved him when he had a bad pull on his BL.  Yay for favors 
returned ;p  Anyway.  Cleric was PISSED (he and I had both resisted the 
longest while the others all capitulated and followed the coaxing monk 
out onto the field), I was adamant on staying at the ruins from that 
point on, the monk and ranger that both thought it was a brilliant idea 
"it just got messy that time" logged off after about 2 minutes, and I 
was out 100pp getting a 96% rez for our poor cleric.

I tell ya, they either need to make rogues a solo class, or give me an 
ability called "bitchslap" :D

Oh, btw, I've joked with some about this before - I was ONE blue from 
hitting 40 when the monk said "I've got a good idea, follow me".  I'm 
telling you, the warning bells ARE NEVER WRONG!  Fortunately, this time, 
ignoring them (Why do I do it to myself?  Because I can!) didn't get me 
killed, and there WAS a high level cleric around to deal with the death 
of the one victim of the whole insane plot.
