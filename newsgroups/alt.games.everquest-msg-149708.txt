Rogue, level 60 and alt level 54/55
Wizard, level 54, still using TBoots/Dragoon Dirk, although I broke down and
    did the gnome Eldritch Collective gear quests with her....only 50+ I
know
    wearing her level >10 clothes (although she was literally naked until
level
    53, as a "proof of concept" character to thumb my nose at folks who
complain
    about caster gear...try to play ANY melee/Hybrid to level 35+ with NO
    gear besides TBoots.  I bet they won't last long...)
Druid, level 42 (on brother's account...mainly just a port/DS/heal whore
    while my main or my alt are aa xp'ing)
Monk, level 26, currently working to max FD and Mend :-).
SK (gnome), stuck for a while why the monk borrows his Fungi.  That's
    his Ikky BP and haste sash you have, BTW ;-).

Brother has a cleric (now 60) that I'll dual-box for raids sometimes,
but I REALLY don't like to because then I can't laugh at the warriors'
DPS during the fights like a rogue is supposed to...
;-)

(this also doesn't include two corpse mules in the Hole and Kael,
but they're not "real" characters, even if the ogre is wearing some
pretty sweet no-drop loot and weilding some pretty wicked weapons...
oh, well, maybe someday).
