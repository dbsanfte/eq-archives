When I try to install, I get the message that it's searching for directx
runtime components and that it may take a few minutes.  Something like 15
minutes later, it's still not finished and when I control-alt-delete it says
that it's not responding.  I've got Windows Me and I read the previous post
about deleting all the "inf" files, but I don't find as many as the previous
poster says.  But it doesn't matter, because when I delete them it doesn't
change anything.

Can anyone help?

Thanks in advance.
