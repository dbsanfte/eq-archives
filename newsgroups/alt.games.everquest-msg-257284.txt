I've always been curious about Luclin.  We, my phone budddy and I,
pronounce it diiferently.  He pronounces it luck-lynn, I pronounce it
loose-lynn.  As one that is prone to mispronunciation, I pick KEI, as
my buddy still says Kodiac like the bear, not Ko-add-ick as it's
spelled.  I made this mistake too until I looked closely.
