My, at the time, 23 druid was hunting in Marus Seru recently, kiting red 
stonegrabbers.  I can say with certainty that there were no more resists 
when the mob was low on health and running than at any other time during 
the fights.  While there I also fought a number of white and dark blue 
greyhoppers, same thing.  I was getting the occasional resist, but no more 
so at low health than at high health.  I was not using any rain spells, 
just nuking.  Maybe at high level this is the case, but I have not noticed 
it with other spells, and, as stated, I never use rain spells really, so I 
would not have noticed a real pattern there.
