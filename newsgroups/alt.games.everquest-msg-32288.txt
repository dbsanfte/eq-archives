I've never read this Series, but man o man, are those two a couple of the
greatest Fantasy Writers I've ever read. Second in my opion only to Mr. RA
Salvatore. I still haven't read the second part of the new Dragonlance War Of
Couls novels, but I'll get to it one of these days. That and I still need to
get to Salvatores new Demon Wars Saga.  But still, I would reccommend nearly
any book by Weiss and Hickman, or R.A. Salvatore.

P.S. - If you've never Read the Dragon Lance Chronicles, or the Dark Elf Saga,
either of thsoe are Amazing.....Actually I think the Crystal Shard saga came
before the Dark Elf one, but you don't NEED to read it. I forget how the order
worked.
