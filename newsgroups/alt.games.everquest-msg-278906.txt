If you're going to restrict it in that arbitrary way, how about restricting
the semantic definition in yet another obvious way, and state that, in EQ
terms, a damage shield is a spell cast on a player or mob that damages
anyone attacking it.

Of course, that makes all the rest of the cleric damage shields also not
damage shields.  =)

It also makes some druid and magician skills problematic to categorize,
particularly the single-hit damage shields.

There is a fundamental difference with the riposte skill (though I wouldn't
be opposed to considering it a damage shield).  It also prevents damage to
the person getting hit.


I guess the best way to find out if anything qualifies as a damage shield
"in EQ terms" is to see whether the damage shield mods on equipment work
with it.  It might be tricky finding a cleric with a damage shield mod on
equipment.  =)  It is, however, unlikely that the other cleric damage
shields will be affected by the damage shield mods.  I've never tested it to
find out.
