With Luclin, there is practically zero caster loot that's worth going to
ST for, that can't be bettered significantly easier elsewhere on the
moon.

10 useable primals in a raid? Ex-squeeze me? Baking powder?

5 primals being looted on a raid counts as a great haul. Sometimes you'd
get nothing but 2handers from a 50 person raid clearing all the way down
to warders and killing 1,2 and 3. By the time you are killing the 3
warders, you'll have zero use for 2handers.

Non-melees never went to ST for personal gain even pre-awakening, but
you needed a bucketload more. Post awakening you just "need" a good
puller, a couple of clerics, a shaman or two for slows, and an AFK
chanter for buffs. Everyone over than is damage output, and can be
melee, caster, or whoever wants to turn up.

The 'script' is good. What is bad is the risk/reward now. Should've made
the zone non-shortcuttable, and put a heavy stash of assorted primals
onto FA down at the bottom. They still get their wish of a permanent
change with a definite effect both in content and loot, but primals
aren't so restricted as they are now.

Hell, buff up FA and make him drop 6 assorted primals every time, but
not spawn until the entire zone is cleared, or just have a zonewide
CT/Tunare-style agro. Put FA on a week long timer, and MotG/Prog on a
3day timer with a chance of dropping primals, so smaller guilds can
still get a sniff between the priary guild's farming.

Even make a new mob (Kerafym's Chest - with the graphic from Hate chest
mobs only huge), chuck him after FA by Kerafym's bubble, and give him a
CT style zone-repop when he spawns weekly - untargettable until
everything in the zone is dead.

Or make a new mob: Weaponsmith of Veeshan. This mob spawns after the
zone is clear, and you hand him some 'Proof of Strength' items the
golems and gargs drop on the way down. 'Proof of Warsword Proficiency'
for a Primal warsword, etc. These 'proofs' poof on zoning out of ST (eg:
PoF). Weaponsmith gives some quest color about how you 'proved yourself'
and how he'll give you these weapons to help recapture the Sleeper, and
should the time come, he'll call upon your help.

The main bone of contention seems to be that a single guild can't
monopolise the zone one day a week and equip everyone in double-quick
time like pre-awakening guilds could. Any of the above ideas off the top
of my head would enable the following:
1: VI's intent of a dynamically changed game world as a result of player
action.
2: Primary ST-focussed guild can still spend an entire night down there
for similar to pre-awakening level of primal reward
3: Smaller guilds can get a sniff at primal outside the primary guild's
farming.

(disclaimer: I'm sure there are problems with the above ideas, but they
were just off the top of my head and seemed to solve a lot of the
awakening issues. I'm sure if I was paid to think up these ideas and had
nothing to do but focus on them, those problems wouldn't be there)
