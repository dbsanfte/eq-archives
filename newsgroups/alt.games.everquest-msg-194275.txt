Easiest to hardest:

Talendor - fire - wimpy easy.  I've 6-manned him more than once.

Faydedar - fire - moderately easy.  Hardest part is catching him up and
getting a raid force to him.

Severilous - DR? PR? - fairly tough, gates, *highly* contested so very hard
to catch up to work out a good plan.  Has a truly ugly fear in a heavily
populated zone, enjoy the adds.  :)  Hint, he gates to the back wall of CoM.

Trakanon - PR - pretty tough, gates, will even gate from one side of his
lair to the other.  174 PR will keep you alive through the fight, aim for
that.  "Trak touch" sends the MT to the shrooms.  Fun stuff.  One of the
best fights in Kunark.

Gorenaire - resist?  HAH! - Freakin annoying big AE with a slow and either
unresistable or I have the worst luck imagineable.  HUGE radius, and casters
can't land spells outside of melee range, *and* there's nothing to hide
behind and pop out around a corner, *and* you have to do the bulk of the
damage with casters cause that slow will make all your melees just
speedbumps on the way to the casters.  Gorenaire is without a doubt the
hardest Kunark dragon.  Oh yeah, and she CH's to top it all off.  :)
