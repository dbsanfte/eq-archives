THere are changes to KEI - a minimum level for the spell's target -
already on test (at least so a guildmate tells me). So changes to
KEI are certainly on the cards, but whether those changes go into the
patch on the 11th I dont know....

I'd be interested in if the same thing is happening to Voice of Quellious
- because if it isnt I still see a certain amount of use of high grade
mana regen spells occuring and so the same problems. OK it doesnt last as
long but that lowers the price and also gets the chanters bugged like
crazy for stuff.
