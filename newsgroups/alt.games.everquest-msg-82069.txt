No, I'm really <not> narrow minded, Probis. I just can't understand why
someone would post in another language to an obviously english NG, where
they are not even likely to be responded to. Isn't that most of the point of
posting? To get an answer or to say something to a particular group of
people? The 'other language' posts seem never to have a response under them,
which I guess, is what set me wondering. Why post if you don't get a
response? And if they can actually read english and see that it's an english
NG, then why post in Arabic or Hebrew or Swahili? **wish** that I spoke
another dozen languages instead of just 2.5. I just can't help but wonder
what the postee is saying/asking!

thanks,
Dark
