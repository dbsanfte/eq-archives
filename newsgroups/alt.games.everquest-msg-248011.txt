The problem that can arise on a straight roll system is people only showing 
up to raids they stand to benefit from (ie where loot drops for them).  
With DKP, you have to attend raids to get points, even if you won't get any 
useful loot from that particular raid.

Certainly true.

In the guild I am in, we use DKP, but not bidding.  Officers and advocates 
decide on the value of an item, and everyone interested who is close in 
points can be in on a roll for the item.  On rare occasions, loot is 
reserved for a specific class.
