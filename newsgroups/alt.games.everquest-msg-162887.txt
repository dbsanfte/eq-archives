There's a number of possible explanations here. But all of them rely on
you (and/or jabobber) being on somebody's hate list.

First off, speaking as somebody who spent many a lowbie level in the
gorge, I can tell you that the pathing in that zone is just about as bad
as any zone in the game. It's been that way since day one and it's never
been fixed. Were I inclinded to promote cheating, I could tell you of a
spot where low level nukers can stand and pull minos and, with only
taking two or three steps back and forth, nuke them all day without ever
getting hit.

During one of your fights you may very well have gotten on the shared
aggro list of other mobs in the area, but due to pathing they were
unable to get you. Jabobber is subject to the same quirky pathing, hence
his tendency to go on little nature walks. If his walk took him to a
point where one of these lost, lazy aggro mobs targetted him, they could
then follow him back to smoosh you.

Also, (and it's been a long time so this may be wrong) but don't some of
the eyes have an AoE of sorts? That could also lead to weird aggro
situations when combined with the bad pathing.

Unless you ran into a huge bug, the gimp should never lead unaggro'd
mobs back to you. We fight gnolls in JPF a lot, and my wife's pet is
often found standing on a spawn point when they pop. And when they do,
Jabbober and the gnoll sit around politely having tea and waiting for us
to finish medding, buffing, whatever. The pets are decidely indifferent
to all mobs until you jump into the action.
