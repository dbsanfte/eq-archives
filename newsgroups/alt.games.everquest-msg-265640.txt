Great for nearly all classes, in my view.

My wizard loves HoTT.  If the names in the HoTT box started bouncing
around, time to slow down, tank has no aggro; if casters start appearing
and then being summoned a) I'm not doing enough damage wtf other people
being summoned before me and b) time to spam concussion; mob is looking at
me but HoTT window shows tank as the target - incoming spell of some kind;
etc.
