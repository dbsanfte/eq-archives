I'm a shaman, I can't AoE farm anything.  I can slow 4 mobs at once, I can 
cast a rain spell that will damage up to 4 at once, not enough damage to 
actually kill what I am interested in farming.  Nope, I use my pet and kill 
them one at a time, tossing nukes around to aggro more to keep my pet 
supplied with targets.
