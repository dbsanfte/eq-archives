see? i knew that . . you just posted a few weeks ago and said it was a year
and a half, but it really is longer, like i said


i know it seems odd to bring up such a point, but once, a long time ago, i
had newsgroup access for the first time

it only lasted a little while (took me all this time to put it back
together)

i came here


i remember a few things, and my head being the big big memory box it is
(saves me from thinking), i have to check that it's not too flawed

i remember the dark tyger sig, and the 'fiesty/catty' way of posting

i remember some monk talking about how he was going on his first plane raid,
asking for advice, and saying that he was a little into 46 and going to take
off of work to get atleast a yellow into 47 (or something)

    ^i remember this because i thought, "gah, my highest is a level 18
druid! i'll never break 30! i want my game to be so                 intense"

i remember annie inviting everyone to her wedding, and the funniest sig of
"Annie <--- has to go /auc for some cake"

i remember myself posting that i wanted a formula to explain how adding a
stat to an item changed its value, depending on how relevant that stat was
to the other stats, and how it was exponential that +9 wis >> +7 wis . . all
i heard was a bunch of "gotta develop a feel for it" and that's what i did


anyone else remember any of these things? when was this? all i know is that
it was a while ago, and i'm using this group's regulars to try to trace back

i guess it isn't important, but i want to make sure my head still works, ya
know?
