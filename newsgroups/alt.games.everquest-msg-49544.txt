Yes quite.
A wood elf can be NG
A Tunare worshipper can be NG
So it's only when you choose to be a druid you can't be that.

Get my point yet, or do I have to look for a case where chosing a race
prevents you from being an alignment class and religion would allow?

Sometimes race will remove options. Sometimes class will remove
options. Sometimes religion will remove options.
All three are equally important, and singling out the cases where
religion will remove options and listing them as non-viable is
pointless. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop treating the religious
limitations as different from the class limitations and race
limitations - there's a reason all 3 are involved in alignments.
