you shouldnt have a problem getting a group in Dreadlands. everyone
needs more tanks there. and when you do, get the drachnid leg tips
which make good piercing weapons. i make a lot of money there either
in groups or solo with my necro. with the money buy a robe of some
sorts for about 500pp.....either advisors or oracle or something. get
a stein of moggok for around 175pp and a harvester for 500pp. dagger
of marnek should be way under 100....i paid 40 for mine. the rest is
just +int items. ive spent about 1500 altogether for items and my
necro does fine. no need for uber twink stuff.
