Well, you see the point is that they're asking for -DUOS-... yes, a
Necromancer is good alone... but he wasn't asking for solo... he was asking
for -DUOS-.

Necromancer/Druid -IS- a duo, a rather effective one, too. He's trying to
find a pair of classes he and his wife can play and be effective, since that
would allow them to spend time together. So obviously, they don't really
seem to care about epic hunting groups at this point... just quality time.
:b

Necromancer/Ranger was thrown in because it would work, too. It's all about
suiting someone's fancy by listing -all- of the options. Maybe he or his
wife doesn't want to play a Druid... maybe one of them is more inclined to
play a melee. <shrug>
