Did you train any points into Alchemy at all?
If not, do so.  If yes, did you train more than one point?
If you trained your alchemy up to 5, and you are level 25, you will not get
any increases until you level.
Your skill in alchemy can only be 5*(level-24).  So, at level 25, you can
have an alchemy skill of 5.  When you go up a level, you can go up 5 more
points in alchemy.  The maximum alchemy skill you can have at level 60, is
180, because of this cap.
