To be honest if you said GF to me, I too would be heading right to Greater
Faydark. :)  Just as, to you BB is ButcherBlock, but to us people from the
North, BB is BlackBurrow.  Just a mixup in terminology.  I rarely use
abbreviations for zones as sometimes stuff like this happens and can be a
horrible horrible time waster.

I would say Grim if you must shorten it :)
