It might have only been higher level Druid roots that worked that way.  Last
I saw anyone give numbers was a long time ago, in posts by Sang, so it may
have changed since then.

Anyone want to experiment?  Get a stop watch, cast a root on something, and
start the stopwatch when you see the message that the thing has been rooted.
Stop it when you get the message that root broke, and record the result.
Repeat until you are bored silly.

I think I'll give this a try with the various Wizard roots, and see what the
numbers look like.  My Druid is only level 20, so won't be as useful.
