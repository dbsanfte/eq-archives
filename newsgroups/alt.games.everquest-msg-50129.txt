Ports in the old world usually run about 10pp, but ports out of unusual places
go for 20pp or more, while ports into or out of Velious often run 50pp and
I've seen many people demand 100pp to port in to Iceclad, which frankly
is a death trap.

If you are asking someone for a port via auction or tell, and state up front
what you can pay, you may get a bargain, on the other hand you may find
yourself having to pay far more than usual for this, then you would to
someone deliberately running a taxi service: if he's actively looking for
port customers he should be advertising a price, and also should be porting
with a group, which means he's making up to five times what you are
paying.

Enchanters tend not to pay at all, just breeze/clarity in trade.  Clerics
tend to not pay at all either, but then again they tend to not charge
druids, wizards, or enchanters for ressurection... its like a professional
courtesy.

52 Vicar, Morel Thule
Has probably paid about 100pp total for ports in his lifetime
