I have friend who says that he had the opposite experience, although maybe
his level difference wasn't as large as yours.  At 62, he said the xp from
doing a dungeon with a bunch of 65's was incredible.  He was also probably
getting an xp bonus because the level of the mobs were closer to his level
than normal, but I think that bonus only kicks in post 50.  Not sticking
around to clear the dungeon leaves a lot of xp still on the table.  The
first LDoN missions my usual group cleared out after we completed the
mission on successes and the xp from those dungeons was disappointing.  Now
we only clear out immediately after a success if we want to start another
dungeon immediately.  My character (58) is towards the low-end of my normal
LDoN group ranging from 57 to 62, but it's more of a ladder of levels
instead of a sharp break and I'll usually get 3-4 blues from xp'ing until
the dungeon kicks us out.
