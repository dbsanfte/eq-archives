Personally, I don't keep arms to defend the Constitution (though, if
called upon, I would be willing to defend the ideals of that
document), I keep arms to defend myself and my family, as well as for
the sheer sport of target shooting.  Most NRA types are law abiding
citizens who use and keep arms for a multitude of reasons, including
defense, sport, hunting, and even for work purposes (there are police
who belong to the NRA, and I'd imagine quite a lot of them).  Very few
are "nut cases" as you call them.  I happen to be a member, and I'm
quite proud of that fact.

I'll agree with you on this 100%  :)

And here is the problem with the second amendment, Jefferson and
company got a little flowery with the language and left the damned
thing too open for interpretation.  The way I see it, the second
amendment says that a militia is necessary for the security of the
state... And because of this, the right to keep and bear arms will not
be infringed upon.  Not that you have to be a militiaman to keep and
bear arms.

This interpretation is easily demonstrated by even a cursory
examination of Thomas Jefferson's other writings of the time period,
where he did, in fact, indicate that the 2nd amendment was the thing
that gave the other rights teeth.  That it was the MOST necessary
right of all, because without it, the government would feel free to
ignore all the other rights.  He himself was the owner of more than a
few firearms, and would be considered a radical nutjob today.  He also
commented (and I'm not quoting verbatim here) that it was the right of
the citizen to keep arms to defend himself from all threats, foriegn
and domestic.  This is a man who wanted citizens who could rebel
against central authority, should that authority become corrupt or
evil.  That's the whole purpose of the 2nd amendment.

I'm going to cut off now, this is a "hot button" topic for me, and I
can go on for many pages, often incoherently.  So stopping now might
be a good idea  :)
