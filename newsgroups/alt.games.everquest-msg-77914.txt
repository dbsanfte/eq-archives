I don't think its as bad as you all make it out to be. Checking fairly
common items....

FBSS: 5,600pp
Lammy: 8,400pp
Jade Reaver: 7,700pp
GBS: 7,900pp
Fungal tunic: 23,400pp
Idol of the Thorned: 20,300pp

Before luclin at least those are all fairly reasonable prices on any
of the servers I've played on. A bit high, that is to be expected, but
always about relatively the same amount overpriced, 15% or so.

Look at it this way; for selling common items try for what eqprices
asks for but be willing to be talked down.

Where EQprices fails is ultrarare items.

Cobalt Bracer: 60,300pp: there is no accepted price on this or other
blindingly rare items. Get what you can get, its usually trade only.

Manastone: 28,100pp: since its no longer dropped anywhere in Norrath
its value is generally a lot higher than its worth. (one of my
characters has one though hee hee) Same goes for Rubicite and one or
two other things.

So yeah I think you can use EQprices as a guide, just be flexible.

For the curious... the most expensive item in EQprices:

Cobalt breastplate: 127,500pp

Donals and a couple of 1hs follow close behind.
