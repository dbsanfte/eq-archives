I have re-rolled characters in the past and it will typically let me
reuse the name once if I give it a few minutes to sync. I say once,
because I once tried a second subsequent name re-use and it would not
let me use it a third time.

Also tried to use the same name on a character of a different class
once, and it wouldn't let me do so.
