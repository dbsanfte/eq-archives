Does NOT include bond of inruku recourse; 135 hp a tic 42 second 
duration, seems to me to qualify as a buff with a heal over time component.

On the other hand Celestial Healing potions (including the new XI, which 
is the highest level one usable on Combine) do go here now, I drank one 
yesterday in the middle of a fight and thought I'd somehow been 
interrupted, drank a second before realizing the buff was up in a 
different window!

OK, they didn't do the same fix for SK, Pact of Decay still has a single 
  buff.

But Necros report that yes, you get two buffs now when you cast this, 
which is of course utter crap, buff slots are hard to come by and its 
rare you'll want the illusion enough to sacrifice one that actually DOES 
  something.  Fortunately even on Combine we now have buff block, and 
its possible to block the illusion spell from ever landing, unblock it 
on those rare occaisions when you want it.

Further, you can also do the reverse, block the buff but keep the 
illusion.   That would mean, for instance, that you could block the buff 
portion of the earlier forms and then have them available as various 
sorts of self illusion buff.
