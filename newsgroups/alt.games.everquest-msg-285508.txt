That's two people questioning my assertion, so I'm probably wrong :)

I do have some direct evidence that adding a 4th person to the hatelist
does SOMETHING to aggro: I duo a lot as an enchanter with a shaman partner,
and in places where she can't tank, we often use a charmed mob.  Even
with nerfed damage output, they still have a lot of HP to soak up, and
usually a charmed pet lasts for about 3/4 of a kill, at which point I break
charm and we root/nuke both of the very-hurt mobs.

Normally this works well - the charmed pet holds aggro reasonably well.
HOWEVER, the instant she sends in a pet, either her summoned dog or her swarm
pet AA, the mob comes straight for one of us (usually her, thank goodness ;).
Similarly, if a friend joins us, the charmed mob no longer can keep aggro at
all.  I'll verify that this is still happening and pay more attention to exact
details next time we play.

I always attributed this to the rule of 4, but maybe something more subtle is
going on, or maybe it's different for charmed and summoned pets.  Alternate
theories for me to test are welcome!
