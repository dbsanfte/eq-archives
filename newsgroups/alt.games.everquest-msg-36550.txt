I've seen him once, got a quiver, and ended up just dumping it since it
had no real use at the time (this was back before the quiver-usefulness
patch, when people were using backpacks for quivers)!

I don't know where he spawns, but he wanders all over the zone. Coloth
Meadowgreen also does this. Both can drop the runed oak bow, but I
believe its a rare drop on Kroldir, a common drop on Coloth. Coloth's
about 15 levels higher, of course.
