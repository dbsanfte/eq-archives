Well now, I have to disagree with you all. Biz, opinions are neither right
nor wrong, they are just opinions and cannot be proven. As an example I put
forth this opinion:

The New York Yankees are the best team in baseball (not necessarily my
opinion by the way).

I am sure I can find thousands of people to agree with me (maybe not on this
board). That still does not make me right. Likewise I could find an equal
number to disagree with me, yet I am still not wrong. The Yankees can go on
to win the World Series, again, but still the opinion stated above can not
be proven true or false. Only agreed with or disagreed with.

However, the point that makes Lokari's opinion (for what it's worth) valid
or not, is something that Michael stated in his last post. He said
(approximately) that "spending money on charities gives you less of a
return." Again, I disagree with this opinion, but he can have his opinion
and I can have mine.

The whole crux of the matter is the return you get on your money spent. For
some people, dropping however much money 10K pp costs is well worth the
investment I would imagine. If the return they get means a greater enjoyment
of the game, then in no way is it fair to call them idiots. They know what
they are buying, and they know what they are giving up to get it.

Many people might call Lokari an idiot for spending all that time
researching tailoring recipes, trivial points, etc., and putting it up on a
website. Many would say that she is wasting (wasted? not sure if she has
kept the site current - probably has) huge amounts of time. Many people are
of the opinion that time is more valuable than money. However, the key rests
on the return she gets, and only she can decide if the return is worth the
investment. Does she make any money from the site? Maybe, maybe not, who
cares. Does she get personal enjoyment knowing she is benefitting the entire
EQ community? Maybe, maybe not, who cares. It only matters to Lokari.

So anyway, if people want to sell virtual items and coins for real life
money, let them. And if people want to buy virtual items and coins using the
money they worked hard to earn, let them. Is it against the EULA?
Absolutely. As with anything in life, there are risks that go along with the
potential rewards. You want to hunt this guy's identity down and report him
to Verant and get his account banned, go ahead.

But then you would be an idiot for wasting all that time(joke.)

Really, these people know it is against the rules. They do it anyway.
Pointing it out to them doesn't deter them from trying to do it anyway. So
just ignore them. Posting auction information may be looked down upon by
some in this newsgroup, but it is still not illegal and they have every
right to do it. Ignore them. Don't force your opinions upon them. Ignore
them. Don't flame them and start a pointless thread which elicits
long-winded posts like mine. Ignore them. And if all else fails, you guessed
it: ignore them.

Thanks for listening (those of you who got this far ;-)
