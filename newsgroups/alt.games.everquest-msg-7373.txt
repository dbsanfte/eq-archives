if you're having to roll for RS in your groups, and you play a rogue, the
solution is simple. dump your group and find a better one.
I've NEVER been in a group where the only rogue had to roll for RS in CT.
now, if there were TWO rogues, the two of them would have to roll. but
that's the only rolling I've EVER seen happen for RS.

when you first get a group, find out what the loot policy is. if they tell
you that the whole group rolls for RS even though you're the only one who
can use it, then immediately find another group.

If you're the one starting the group, lay down the rules from the beginning,
make sure all new members are aware of the rules, and make sure they know
that if they don't like the rules, they can go find a different group.

It's not the fault of twinks, it's the fault of greedy people. period.
and there will be greedy people regardless of twinking being in existence or
not.
