/agree

I've never agreed with pandering to the 'top end player'... they consume 
10x the bandwidth and other resources, yet pay the same monthly fee... 
and there is NO keeping up with them.

And they aren't the majority of players by a long shot... so it isn't 
even the core playerbase.

Let them buy Horizons and AC2 and whatever else and they can "beat" 
those between normally spaced eq expansions if EQ isn't keeping them 
busy enough.
