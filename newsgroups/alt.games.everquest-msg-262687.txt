Actually, the system is fucked beyond belief, and the only reason it 
remains unchanged is because it suits those who are used to alternate in 
power.

In US Presidential Elections there is no such thing as "a significant 
difference", there is only *win* or *lose*.

I couldn't agree less. Assuming I were a leftist and a Nader supporter... 
I may want dearly to see Nader's percentage of the vote increase from 
whatever minuscule figure it is now to another somewhat bigger but still 
irrelevant figure; but almost certainly I wouldn't find that worth 
having to live through another four years of Bush administration.  (
replace the above with the incumbent, challenger and independent 
candidates of your choice, of course)

You may call that false pretenses, I call it simply not being daft. That 
people cannot vote their conscience is the clearest symptom of a 
catastrophically broken system.
