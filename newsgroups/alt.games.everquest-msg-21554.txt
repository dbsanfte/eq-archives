If an enchanter is trying to mez something, never cause damage to it.  If
you're trying to pull an add (something unexpected) off the enchanter you
have 2 options:  root it and let the enchanter know to back up (not a great
solution, since your root does damage, and I just said never to cause
damage. :) ), or heal the enchanter.  After a couple heals the critter
should be on you like jock itch, and the enchanter can safely mez the
bugger.

Not glaringly, but if root is ALWAYS memmed you can probably dump it.  It
does come in handy lots of times...but not EVERY time like SoW, snare, and
heal.  Lots of classes can root, and I think no one else but druids (and
maybe rangers...dunno) have root that does damage.  It's a great soloing
spell (root/snare/dot) but if in a group try to talk a non-damage rooting
class to do the honors.
