I don't know if this has been asked before. I tried to do a search and see
if it had been asked or not.

Has there been any discussion about a XP modifier when you are actively
being attacked by multiple mobs?
When multiple mobs are hacking on you, they get a damage multiplier simply
from the fact that there are multiple ones on you.
Wouldn't it be nice for those intrepid groups or soloists that constantly
pull doubles or triples to get some kind of XP mod? Instead of just pulling
singles all the time?
Or would this cause some kind of game imbalance where groups would scour a
zone, trying to get as many mobs at once?

Any thoughts?
