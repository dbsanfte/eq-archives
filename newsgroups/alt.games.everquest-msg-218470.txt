good.....beats being ig'nant

> 1: what should my stats be for str/int/wis and such at this level?

there is no should.......don't worry about your stats.....work on the stats
that are crucial to your style of playing

> 2: what should by hp/ac be around?

hp ....i dont' remember

ac.....it shouldn't be anything - stop worrying - you're a ranger and your
ac will always stink

*always*

> 3: where is the best place for plat hunts?

kunark ...you can solo in The Overthere up to 45 and make some cash in the
process (fear kiting is cake, though boring and clicking-intensive)

>     A) been in High Keep and ButcherBone but takes forever.

when you get bored, move on


> 4: what is the best tradeskill for me?

none! fletching is good if you have a lot of time or money on your
hands....it's affordable to make decent arrows though

> 5: ideas on how to upgrade my ranger?

just level ...hit bazaar and shop for good deals (they're out there if
you're patient)

> 6: i quested my own armor

good....every quest in the game is bested by something you can loot though
=P

bank the quest armor and shop for items that work for you and your lvl

> 7: any help appreciated with ideas

don't rush to level.......levels will come
