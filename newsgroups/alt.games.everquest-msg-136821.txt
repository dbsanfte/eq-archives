The cleric epic is not difficult.

Its bottlenecked.

Difficult would be if you had to kill the sleeper to get final step.

Bottlenecked would be if there was an orc pawn that spawned once
a month in a known spot in EC.

All the steps of the cleric epic are fairly simple, if a little time consuming,
if there was no bottleneck a cleric willing to do so could probably get
his epic in three days.

Ragefire is about as difficult as Naggy, only you aren't limited to
level 52 and under characters to kill him.

On average, a cleric who just reached the Ragefire stage on
Morell Thule can expect a 9 month wait.  Like waiting on that
orc pawn, with a bunch of other clerics around who also want
the pawn.  KS fest, list, list by guild... doesn't matter, however
you look at it there will be only one per month, and on average
it isn't going  to be you!
