>> Here is a novel idea...GROUP! <<

Are you reading the same post I am? Let me check a few things ....

"CB is EXTREMELY dangerous...I died there seven or eight times in one night,
and with a group at that!"

I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

"and with a group at that!"

"and been surprised to fine about 12-20 Orc Legionaires in the room? Killed
my group real quick."

Sorry, still couldn't hear.

"Killed my group real quick."

What exactly did he say to make you think he wasn't already grouped?
