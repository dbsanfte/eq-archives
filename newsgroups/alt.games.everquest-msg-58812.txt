Well as a shaman i have developed a way to avoid all of this IF we have the
room to manuver. When we gets adds i will slow the mob and nuke it untill it
aggros me. Normally a slow will be enough. I will pull the mob away and root
park it away from the tanks. I have the ac and HP to take a few hits.
