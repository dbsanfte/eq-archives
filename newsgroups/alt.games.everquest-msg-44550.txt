In your case, that certainly makes sense. But in the case of the
original poster, he doesn't want to sell it. He wants it for his twink
and can't find it. It's not a hard series of quests to do for your twink
if you're high enough level, and failing that he's either not going to
find it or pay through the nose.
  In fact, I'd never bothered to get the crafted boots and was still
wearing banded. (eeek!) Yesterday, myself and a 47 cleric went into
permafrost, just the two of us, and cleared everything out to the ice
goblin patriarch and got the totem to finally get the boots. We were in
the area anyway for a Vox raid after the servers come up today, so I
figured I'd try it. Had no trouble single pulling everything. It was
really pretty much of a joke in the end, so this guy, if his main is
high enough level, could probably knock out a full set of crafted in one
or two playing sessions. I solo'd the evil eye prisoners for the last of
the fractured rune pieces I needed for the pauldrons. Most of the rest
are even easier, with the possible exception of the fire goblin in Sol.
