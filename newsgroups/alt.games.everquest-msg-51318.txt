Naw. Still retired until SoL comes out. But I do enjoy this forum, the
folks here, and keeping on top of news until I come back. Getting a
bunch of backlogged stuff done in the meantime, but I'll see ya'll back
in Norrath in December as planned! 
(But yes... I do miss it. Just needed a break, as I said, but in the

Mua ha ha.
