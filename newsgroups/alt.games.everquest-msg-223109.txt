How?  Were you twinked?  Was the ranger actively *trying* to hold aggro
(taunting)?  My ranger would love to get rid of aggro.  Normally to do it i
have to stop hitting and back out of range for a couple secs, or switch to a
slow weapon.  And I'm NOT taunting ever in a group.
If there's something pallies/warriors can do that they are NOT doing I will
pass along the info.
