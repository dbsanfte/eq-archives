Considering the number of people who claimed that Newt's Contract With
America was "hateful," can you imagine what would have happened if there was
hate-speech legislation in place?  It's best not to go down that road.  I
can see a time when suggesting that we spend too much on welfare will be
considered "hateful" towards homeless.

Also, there is no such thing as a right not to be offended.

They have a right to suggest that.  That is political speach.  It's also
bunk, but that's neither here nor there.

Oh, and there are also many (myself included) that consider anything the
U.N. spews to be highly suspect, though I imagine that's hateful speach, and
I'll probably be arrested on-sight, the very next time I step foot outside
the U.S.
