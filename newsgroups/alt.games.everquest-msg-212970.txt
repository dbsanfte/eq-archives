Correct newsgroup.  In the new area to be introduced in LDoN (I think it's
to be called Miracleland or something similar), there are a new race of
oddly-shaped mobs (Tall and wide, but very thin front to back.  If they
stand sideways to you they are almost impossible to see).  They are
recognizable as to their strenth by the badges (lowest is a 2 up to a 10,
then J,Q,K,A) and there clan (4, I think). There are rumors of many other
odd looking creatures (rabbits, Egg-shaped creatures (some on horeseback)
and even a few waterfowl).  It's supposed to be a bit surreal.
