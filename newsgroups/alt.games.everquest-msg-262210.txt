Just a quick question before I go ahead and install XPs new Service patch
SP2.

I assume it is advisable to install the said patch?

Has anyone suffered any problems?

Has anyone had significant problems with SP2 new firewall/security features?

I have 2 machines and both run XP, and are pretty much for the sole purpose
of playing EQ.

TIA.
