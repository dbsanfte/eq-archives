I got what I think was a very good deal for a Crys. Spear.  As a rogue, it's
nice to have a 13 dmg weapon in hand and doing some tasty backstabs with it.
Problem is that it's 30 delay.  I'm thinking there might be someone with
more of a bankroll somewhere on my server that might have, say, a Haste item
and not care as much about the 30 delay.

So....  what *might* I be able to get in trade for a Crys Spear?  I'm only
looking at other piercers, obviously.  Trak Tooth?  What?

This is really just an idea I'm toying around with.  I'm not actually trying
to auction it at this point.
