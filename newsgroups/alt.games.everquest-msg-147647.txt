My guild, 14 months ago, slowly went from an average of level 35 to 52 now.
We have only a handful of mains below 50, so I can easily imagine you're in
my guild posting this.

Realizing this is totally off topic but I'd recommend leaving your present
guild for one with a lower average level.  We've lost a couple people
recently for that very reason and I can't say as I blamed them at all.
They're good people and I'll miss 'em, but....
