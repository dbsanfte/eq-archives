Since you've been hanging around the Commonlands, I'd guess
you're talking about the Freeport Milita guards who are around
the Inns and the Toll Booth.   You are aware that those guards
are corrupt and on an opposing faction to those at the Freeport
Bank, right?    A quick way for evil races to gain access to the
bank in Freeport is - surprise, surprise - killing those corrupt
guards.

If he does, you very possibly could get banned.  Not just that
character, your account.  I hope the satisfaction was worth it...

BTW, level 13 is a low-level, but not a newbie.  If you haven't
learned to *zone* trouble by now, it's high-time you learn.
There aren't going to be guards near where you'll be fighting
before too long.   By level 13 you should know to run to the
zone if you need to, not to guards and not to collections of
people who may -- or may not -- help.   But it seems most
people don't learn that until they get to head to LoIO and
find out there aren't any guards who won't kill them and
aren't collections of high-levels they can bother either.

Simply put, a level 13 should NOT need a guard.  It's a crutch.
If things get out of hand, run to zone.   It's always going to be
there...
