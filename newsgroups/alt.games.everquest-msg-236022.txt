I hadn't heard about a ten level difference.  As far as I know seven 
levels is the maximum difference.  It is possible that the book that 
shipped with LDoN is wrong.  The game changes so often it probably 
slipped in to the book and then they nerfed it after printing.  Who 
knows?  I could however, be wrong.  If anybody knows different then 
please - enlighten me :)
