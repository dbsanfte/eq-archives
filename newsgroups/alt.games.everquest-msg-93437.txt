>Snip every random non clerics complaint about cleric's meleeing.

There are many situations where a cleric can melee.   Off peak times, it's
often hard to find a "proper", "balanced" group, so you make do.  Maybee the
group is a few robe wearing int casters, and a couple of clerics.   Would
you rather sit around, desperately hoping for a tank to come along?  or make
do, and get some XP?

Orc fort, EW, in the 40s (dont recally exactly when).

2 clerics, 1 chanter, 1 wiz.   Held the centre room (don't recall name, been
a long time).  I (cleric) got speed, werewolf form, all the buffs I could
get and started pulling.  memmed stuns (high agro), DDs, root, etc and went
for it.  Other cleric kept me standing, with stuns & DDs, i was able to hold
the agro of the mob whilst the others killed it.   When later a shaman
joined and I could get other buffs, and the mobs were slowed, I remained
tank (having the superior AC and HP) and we did remarkably well for
ourselves.

Since then, (now 54) I've been involved in numerous groups hunting for
specific quest items.  Mobs have often been blue to me, and with the right
classes, the group needs me to cast maybee 1 cele heal on every 5 or 6
pulls.


Would you rather I was sitting on the floor with mana dripping out of my
ears, when I could be up and dealing damage (not, admittedly, a lot of
damage, but, maybee 600hp melee + DDs per fight, and not requring any heals
as tank has agro)?

So long as your cleric isn't being stupid, and getting dangerously LoM /
Involved so that he can't cast heals when necessary, why should you remove
him from the group when he's only improving your groups kill times?

Seriously folks, when someone has played a class (NOT PLing!) to a decent
level, chances are they know what they can, and can not do, and you should
have the gaul to trust them to do what they do, until they prove they're not
capable.
