My clerical solution to the frequent pleas for Rez help was simple, 
thats 2 cp if you bring the body to me, and 2000pp if I have to come to you.

There were a couple of occaisions where I got paid the 2000... as I 
recall, when someone was willing to fork over that kind of cash it was 
usually a matter of getting into a group and battling our way thru some 
very harsh circumstances to get to the body, while 2K was probably too 
much for the service, it wasn't a cakewalk.  This was also back when a 
lost body was a big deal, with no handy graveyard et al.
