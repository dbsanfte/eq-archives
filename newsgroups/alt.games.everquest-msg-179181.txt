I know that some people may already know who I am, but for a number of
potentially important strategic reasons, and because God has told me to(and
Steven Spielberg) and because in this brave new world a man will likely not
hide behind a fake cartoon name and because what I am doing is not illegal
yet as far as I know, and because I can and get away with it, and because I
know that the law enforcement agencies already know of my existence and were
tapping my phones and were looking into my computer and are not anymore, and
basically because God said he was going to destroy anyone who tries to stop
me from completing my prophecy befitting the manner in which they act
against me, and from what I have seen that is true.

Like I said all I'm going to do is write e-mails, maybe take a picture here
or there along the way, not going to physically interact with the world in
anyway within the course of my prophetic raving which is actually extremely
exhausting and isolating as well, but it needs to be done.

I haven't seen it rain in about a month except once the day the Oakland
Raiders crushed their opponents whose name I don't know as I'm not really
into football.
