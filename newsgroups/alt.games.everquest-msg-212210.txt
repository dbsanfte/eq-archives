If by well equipped you mean sporting a BoW or something else with a
stupidly high hate point proccing weapon, then yeah.

Without one, I've yet to find a single warrior that can reliably hold
aggro from my monk.

Everytime, I have to at last FD once to shake aggro off (or at least
turn off auto-attack and step WAY the hell back for a few seconds).

Paladins and SKs on the other hand, unless they lag really bad, hold
aggro away from me without problems (aside for the occasional "push
the mob into the corner so everyone gets riposte").
