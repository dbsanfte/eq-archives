Alt + Enter puts EQ in a window.  Alt + Tab seems to be semi-broken when
in Full Screen.  Sometimes it jumps and redraws in Full Screen and
sometimes it does the same thing as Alt + Enter.

In any case, when you get to a windowed mode, Alt + Tab should act like
it does with any other windows application in that if you tap it once
and let Alt go, it'll switch to the next application in the window order
list.  If you hold onto alt and hit tab without letting alt go, it
should give you an overlay window with the list of applications you can
switch between, hitting tab to highlight each in turn, and letting Alt
go to activate the highlighted application.

That looks messy, now that I review it, but I really don't want to try
to fix it to be more readable right now.
