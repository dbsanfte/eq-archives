I started a newbie Bard today.  I have a couple of probably easy questions:

1.  What is song twisting, and how do you do it?

2.  Do you have to have instruments to play the songs?  My newbie Bard has a
weapon but doesn't have any instruments.

3.  Do you switch between the instrument and your weapon when your hunting
verses medding?

Thanks )
