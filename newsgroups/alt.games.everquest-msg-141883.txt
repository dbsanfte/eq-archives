According to the game rules noone can claim any spot of land as there own, if
you dammage or affect a monster first it is of course yours, and if someone then
tries to take it that is kill stealing, or KSing.  It is not KSing however to
intrude upon someone's camping spot.  However I like to consider playing EQ like
using the basket ball court at the park, if you see a group of people playing
hoops you don't just walk on to that court and start playing your own game.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind.
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
