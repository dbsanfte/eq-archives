Thankfully, I'm a wizard!  The enchanter who was up for the drop was very
good about it, but she is one of the most mature players I know in the game
(I guess enchanters need that ability).

Just East of the firewall, on the North wall.  In retrospect, this was

anyway.

Thanks for the info!  We will certainly try that one again for practice,
enchanter epic mob or not!
