Oops I meant fantastic xp. This is basically the equivilent of the
butcher block turn in quests but its for evils and much easier because
you can turn in fire beetle eyes also (when amiable or above) and you
can buy them in unlimited quantities. Most of my evil characters do
this quest a ton to level 14 or 15.

(Talking about the quest with dismal rage in the east freep sewer so
even if glower you can train soon at the barbarian warrior trainer
down there.) The ogre warrior that I made recently doing this is
rallos zek also, so you can do it too.
