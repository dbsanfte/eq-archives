What I've seen repeatedly are systems in which more points are
coming in than are going out, I think.  This points to (as has been stated
elsewhere in the thread) a problem with the values used in the system
rather than with the idea of the system.  I've merely been unlucky,
I suppose, to have weathered several guilds where the points awarded
per raid and the point costs of items were not correctly balanced.

My current guild has introduced a bid system, and it seems items are
going for far more points than they did (value for value) in the previous
systems I've seen, while the points per raid is about the same.  An
item I've seen pointed at 10 is getting bids up to 30 or 36 while the
same approximately 6 points per raid per person are being doled out.

A side concern I don't see being addressed by any points system would
be Guests.  As a cleric, I've been invited along on LOTS of raids for
guilds I'm not a member of.  And I really enjoy doing so.  But let me
tell you, points systems SUCK when you aren't a guild member.  While
the rank and file of the guild may have no chance at loot, they are at
least making their guild more powerful, and they can console themselves
that eventually they will accumulate enough points to bid on at least
some items.  A Guest, on the other hand, is helping some other guild,
and has even fewer points than the rank and file, and isn't likely to be
a guest so very often that his accumulated points are ever going to be
meaningful in any way.

If your guild never needs the services of an outside the guild cleric,
chanter, rogue, high end warrior then this isn't a concern, of course, but
if it does, then how does a point system help you get them?  I'm
generally disgusted when I help out on a raid someone begged me
to come to only to find that getting any of the loot is not merely highly
unlikely (it usually is on raids) but literally impossible.  While my
selfishness in hoping for a shot at something if something I could use
drops is certainly a factor, I feel more strongly a moral outrage
that anyone could issue such a plea knowing full well that their
system is patently going to deny any possibility of reward.  Of course
some of the guilds I've helped specifically go to a random system
when they have guests to prevent just such occurances, although
they use a points systems for more serious raids where its all
"in house" talent.
