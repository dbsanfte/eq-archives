You failed math I guess. If the rest of us all quit you'd have the
entire EQ server to yourself for a subscription rate of:

400,000 x $12.95 =  $5,180,000 

So your subscription rate is going up to

$5,180,000 

Per month. to keep this game alive.

Guess you better get a few more jobs at Burger King.
