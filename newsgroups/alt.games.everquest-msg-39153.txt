There are PvP and non-PvP zones. The non-PvP zones are large enough
that a PC never has to enter the PvP zones unless they choose so.

The PvP zones are mainly designed for RvR (realm-vs-realm) combat.
Think of it as all the players from the same realm form one big group
and these two (or three) groups battle--think Braveheart.

It is possible for a PvP'er to enter a PvE zone. However grieving is
not really possible. Players can't bind in enemy territory so one
death sends a long way home. The borders between PvE and PvP zones are
protected by "uber" NPC guards. Finally, PvP death doesn't result in
xp or item loss, so it's not a big deal.
