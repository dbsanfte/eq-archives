Most of the reputable mages who do damage parses err on
the conservative side fore pet procs.  You know it hit
by the message, and you multiply all the procs by the
basic damage (140 something for the summoned weps in a
level 60 pet's hands) then multiply it by a pretty
conservative fudge factor.  The way you come at that
is by looking at the partials on your own spells, since
the PoP pets are so close in level.

I would never put us 1st (charmed pets) but the PoP additions sure
brought us as close to balanced as can be.
