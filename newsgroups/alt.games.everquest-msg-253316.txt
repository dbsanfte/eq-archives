God sewer trials are awesome fun. They're like sebilis used to be.
Long, hard, see invis mobs, weird adds, trains, the works. But... and
its a big but... they have *purpose*, an objective, good xp and great
occasional loot drops. So you *will* fail, and *will* be frustrated
sometimes, but also.. its rewarding in a way LDON isnt. LDON is
just a guaranteed 40 minute grind for 50 points if you're not doing
hards... GOD at least is challenging to skilled 65's and has 
substantive real rewards.

As for the actual later content, beyond sewers, vxed and tipt... well,
its mostly raid content, although Kod Taz is achievable by the unuber
and is the closest thing to Elemental XP outside the POP flagged
zones. Still pretty boring 'grind' zone though.

GoD *rare* trash drops are EPish level, 100-125hp, stats, focus effects,
etc. They're not flowing like water, but they're good.

Hehe. Welcome to GOD. Your taunt is not the panacea you think it is. Not
when a single controlled mob is unlikely to  remain a single
controlled mob ;)
