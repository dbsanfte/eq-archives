The Halloween events are GM events and were a lot of fun.  What would be
even more fun is if some of those same events were "gain agro over X level
and be booted from the zone" types, a la Nagafen and Vox.  Possibly make
them PvP even on blue servers so I can kill the assholes and spammers who
show up, and it might be very interesting.  It may also be a total disaster,
but I hope that, unlike Khosh, SOE is not of the "throw your hands in the
air and surrender" mindset.
