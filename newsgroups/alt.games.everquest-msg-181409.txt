Oh, I disagree with this.  Tradeskillers who are on top of what
opportunites are available make incredible amounts of money.  That's
the rub though, that you have to know about the items you can make
that people are willing to pay a lot for, and you have to be able to
make them and sell them when the window of opportunity presents
itself, and you have to have the *right* tradeskill up to par to do
it.

I have a friend who jumped on the tradeskill bus fairly early with
PoP.  She was already a grandmaster jeweler, but spent 3 AAs to enable
herself to grandmaster pottery, because she saw the opportunites
available to her.  Now, in the fewer than four months since the
release of PoP, she made over TWO MILLION platinum.  All from those
two tradeskills.

Yes, the opportunites she had aren't quite so profitable now, just
like the opportunities in fletching aren't either (although the
elemental bows are trickling out now).  If you want to make cash, you
have to be able to figure out when something useful's going to hit the
market, and be one of the suppliers.  It goes a lot faster nowadays,
but the profits are still there.

If you throw your money and your grandmaster status at things that
aren't going to sell, that's not really the bazaar's fault, is it?
