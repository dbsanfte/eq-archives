}Ah, but a simple test would flush you out in a heartbeat. If they

}bots and 2 people would find very difficult. Hi, this is GM

Clericbot01 tells you, "I am A.F.K. (away from keyboard) - Our raid uses 
Teamspeak, we've mostly turned /tell and chat channels off.  If it's 
important, get back to us after the raid at 9pm GMT or send a tell to 
Gonzo, our communications officer.  If you're just begging for a rez, no 
rez for j00!"

Just stick variants of that on all the bots...  If you can't pass the 
turing test, create a legal reason for failing. :)  There is precedent... 
before player channels were added, one major raiding guild on Ayonae did 
all their guild stuff in irc.
