Closest match to EQ's playstyle would be DAoC probably. Ashron's call has
better playability than it's sequel, AC2.
Shadowbane is teh roxxor pl4ce. If u r a pk u will <3 it.

I like Star Wars Galaxies, but it's certainly not EQ in space. The style of
play is quite different.

Anarchy Online is supposed to be much improved from it's release.

Really it would help to quantify why EQ only held your interest marginally.
Many of the other games are based on trying to steal segment of EQ
population that thinks they got X right and everything else wrong.

If you really liked EQ, I'd contact SoE. If you are the person the account
was originally billed to, and especially if you can give them the original
credit card number, they will change the password for you back to whatever
you ask for. You may also want to have the CD keys handy as well.
