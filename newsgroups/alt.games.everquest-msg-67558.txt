Aye.  Every user has a PID (personal identi...blah blah you get the idea)
assigned to their account.  When a petition is brought up from the queue it
attempts to do a /who going by the name of the person vice this PID (unless
they FINALLY fixed/changed it).  Though guides can perform a /who on the PID
itself and find whichever character they have logged on from the originating
/petition account.  Sneaky. ;p

Try having a user scold you as a guide because (insert gasping sounds here)
you know the name(s) of their alt(s). <grin>  Humorous to say the least.
