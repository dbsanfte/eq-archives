I went to the Temple of Rodcet Nife in Queynos to test for myself
whether the Koalindl were fishable, when I saw a most remarkable sight:
a dozen or so rats named "a healthy rat" on a grid, with one unique "a
diseased rat", and a few empty squares marked with invisible mobs named,
for example "grid 2e".

When I was done with my fishing/meditating, they had despawned. Does
anybody know what this was all about? It looked like some weird rodent
version of a board game.
