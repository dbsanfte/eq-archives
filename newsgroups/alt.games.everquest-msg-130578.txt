I do think we should stamp out killing with which I disagree.  But, that 
would involve doing a whole lot of killing I'd have doubts with, which 
means it'd have to include at least some that I'd ultimately disagree with 
if I had all the facts.  So just to keep this campaign short and simple, 
everyone please shoot themselves on the count of 3...

}One common and definition is that a requirement for an act to be
}"terrorism" is that it must have as a political goal the intimidation
}of a populace by selective killing, torture, etc. of noncombatants.  In
}other words, a terrorist event must have as a goal the intent to
}instill terror in the victims as an end in iself, and not be a
}byproduct.

That's prettyclose to that dictionary definition that was just given.  The 
dictionary suggested that it just had to have a political goal, and didnt 
specify that that goal be the intimidation.  I figured it as the 
intimidation being the means to achieve the goal.

}The implication of this is interesting because it means that merely the
}killing of noncombatants does not constitute terrorism -- it must be
}part of a strategy of societal intimidation. 
}The distinction between the targeting of noncombatants in an effort to
}instill terror and the killing of noncombatants as a byproduct of a
}campaign is an uncomfortable one for supporters of the Palestinian
}attacks on noncombatants, and they thus both adopt a broader definition
}which applies the name "terrorist" to any killing of a noncombatant
}in order to create a moral equivalency. 

No, I don't think they do have to adopt a broader definition.  The whole 
point you just spent several paragraphs explaining is that whether ornot 
it s terrorism is a matter of not just whether it results in people being 
in terror, but that causing the terror had to be the intent of the 
attacks.  All the Palestinans have to say is that their tactics are chosen 
noton the basis of how much they scare Isreal, but on the basis of they 
only haveone tactic to choose from.  If they try to send a grown man over 
with a bomb, he's more likely to be stopped and searched, and probably.  
If they try to send a less suspcious bomb carrier to an obviously military 
target, they will be stopped and searched, and probably shot, before they 
can even rip a button off his vest.  And tanks and rifles are right out.  
They'd probably be stopped from building a catapult to fling bombs with.  
I doubt they have any of their own Scuds, lame as those rockets appear to 
be.  Pretty much, they're left with pretty young girls with bombs.

But oh gosh, we can't use the only weapon we have.  It might scare 
somebody.

}This redefinition is convenient in the short term, because
}it allows one to use loaded terms in verbal attack.

Yes, isn't that fun? :)

}In the long term, however, it is counterproductive because it either
}removes any real meaning to the term

Well...  Given howmuch trouble we have agreeing on a definition here, I 
think it's just possible that it's to late.  Real meaning has gotten away 
from us.  So the US is engaging in a war on a term without a real meaning.  
This, to me, speaks to the danger of charismatic politicians.  I do like 
your definition though.  However, declaring war on people who INTEND for 
their attacks to inspire fear seems a bit hokey, since intent can be such 
a bugger to prove.  Perhaps renaming it the War on People who Blow Up 
Stuff We Didn't Expect would be a good idea.

}or, even worse, it justifies attacks on the Palestinians.  If there is no 
}distinction between the targeting of civilians for the purpose of 
}instilling terror and the killing of civilians as a byproduct of 
}campaign, then it would be equally OK for the Israelis to target women 
}and children as it is for the Palestinians to do so.

Well, it -is- equally ok.  Personally, I disaprove of it about equally 
strongly in either case.  If you go around killing civilians I really 
amnot going to have much sympathy wth you, whether you were trying to 
instill terror or not.

}The Palestinian campaign of terror is self-contradictory in that it 
}denies this distinction when justifying its own acts but clings
}to the distinction when attempting to dissuade the Israelis
}from equivalent tactics.

You think that Israelis killing Palestinian civilians somehow does 
not strike terror into the Pali heart?
