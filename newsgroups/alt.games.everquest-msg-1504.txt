Usually as wizards advance in level they either use an +int dagger or just
use handheld items that add intelligence or mana and no weapon.  Your
piercing skill would probably be the best to work on, but if you can't get a
hold of a dagger go with the 1h blunt.  In the long run wizards don't
usually melee anyway so don't worry too much about getting a really nice
weapon.
