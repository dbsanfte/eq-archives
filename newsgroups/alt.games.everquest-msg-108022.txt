Any of the stuff before Syd lost his mind was good, once he was out of it,
they changed style a lot without his, uh, "interesting" personality, they
tried out a lot of different styles on Saucerful of Secrets, some good, some
not so good (*cough*jugband blues*cough*)

Other than their soundtrack albums, just about everything up to Waters
leaving (and the subsequent crap known as A Momentary Lapse of Reason) was
excellent;  I just didn't care for More, Obscured by Clouds or Zabriskie
Point all that greatly, and The Wall wasn't really a soundtrack album since
the movie was tailored to the album rather than the other way around.

Division Bell wasn't that bad, but I think they were kind of tainted by
relying on spot writers so much in Momentary Lapse.

I just wish they'd have a reunion tour, get Waters back in and get over here
to the states.

If you like Dark Side era Floyd a lot, I'd recommend trying Alan Parsons
Project and KLF, they're very similar styles of music.
