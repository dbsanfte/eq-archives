A simple commitment to your guildmates. It doesn't have to be a situation 
of indentured servitude to make a contribution of your time.

People keep saying that they can't have both, xp and help the guild. Who 
says you can't devote some of your time to flagging and most of it to 
whatever the hell you want? Of course it won't get everyone flagged as 
quickly as if all your time was spent on it, but the guild shouldn't 
expect as much.

I'm not ignoring that. I'm not suggesting adopting a raiding mentality or 
format.

Who says you can't be of like mind *and* dedicated to each other? 
Additionally, I'll repeat, dedication does *not* mean dedicating all your 
time or even half your time. Just make a freaking contribution that can 
*help* make a difference.

I get that. I merely think they need fixed if anything, not removed.

I will agree they played a big role.
