I agree. Anecdotal evidence isn't nearly as good as empiracal evidence.
So I decided to go check on my lizard. He had *just* dinged 18 before
the patch. (For some reason I thought he was higher. *sigh*.) 

Anyway, I played him today after work. In 2 hours and 40 minutes I
dinged nineteen. But, fair enough, that's still pretty vague. Some
background information before we get to the log parsing:

Character has the same equipement through all of 17 and 18 except at the
beginning of 17 was given a pair of langesax to replace fine steel LS
and a Langesax of the wolves to replace FS 2 hander. At the very *end*
of 18 tonight, was given a better bow (player made) but it's only used
for pulling and I think I got off two shots with it. Armor still almost
entirely banded, etc. No jewelry. Character equipment virtually the same
for all of 17 and 18. (Fifteen and Sixteen too, for that matter, but I
got a new face piece and lighter gloves in there someplace.)  Fighting
for every level since 12 was done pretty much *exclusively* in Kurns
Tower. Exceptions were the random skellie that jumped me running back
and forth through FoB to go to town to buy/sell/bank/tradeskill. Had
zero deaths in levels 15, 16 and 17. Died *TWICE* in level 18.[Note: No
xp rez or rez of any sort at that level, obviously] (Learning your way
around the furbies in the basement is a bitch. Heh.)  Mobs fought over
these levels were, for the most part, always the same. Greater skellies
(mostly all blue in 15 and 16, some light blue but mostly blue in 17,
mostly light blue with some blue in 18) Greater Scalebones (full blue
all the way), Burnai Excavators (all blue all the way). There were some
number of green scalebone skeletons to be cleared out at times to get
bigger game to pop, and the occasional green burnaii burrower, but I
stuck to xp mobs where I could as anyone would.

Assumptions: It takes the more xp to finish 17 than 16, and more to
finish 18 than 17. I think that's a given.

Now let's parse the logs for those three levels. (Throw out yet another
thank you to Joe D. for his great log parser.)

Level 15: Kills - 70. XP gains - 56. Deaths - 0
Level 16: Kills - 95. XP gains - 78. Deaths - 0
Level 17: Kills - 101. XP gains - 82. Deaths - 0
Level 18: Kills - 89. XP gains -72. Deaths - 2

I needed less xp kills in 18 than I did in 16 to finish the level
killing the same mobs, with two xp deaths thrown into the mix.

I think that's better than anecdotal evidence. The xp required and/or
the modifiers are such that you can zoom through levels beyond 11 far
easier than pre-patch.  Now, Virginia, there *is* a dumbed down game. 
;-)
