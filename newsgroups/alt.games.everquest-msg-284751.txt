Been working on it over several levels now, and I'm getting close. Got a 
group together to venture into the Hole to kill High Scale Kirn last night. 
Got the engraved ring I needed from him and dinged 50 in the process (in 
spite of dieing a couple of times from getting gang tackled by red mobs). 

It was interesting to note that the walkthru I have been using recommended 
two to three groups of 60's for this encounter, whereas with today's gear, 
one 70 beastlord, a couple of players in their 60's, two in their 50's and 
I at 49 had very little trouble with it.

I had only been to the hole twice before, and though each visit has been a 
case of me being in a group/raid with much higher level players, it seems 
like it might be a decent enough place to solo soon, with nearly half of 
the mobs (at least those not too deep in) conning dark blue to me even now. 
How would a barbarian shaman go about getting a key to The Hole? I 
understand that through faction work, one can be purchased from a merchant, 
but would that be to the detriment of some other faction(s)?
