On Tholuxe Paells 50 Plat seems to be the going rate, although I regularly see
the level 60 ubers offering 100 plat.  
Please!!!  If you are going to think I'm a cheapskate at 50 plat just SAY you
prefer 100 plat donations.  I'd rather you set a fee that YOU think is fair
than take "pennies" and bitch about it all night long and think badly of me.
