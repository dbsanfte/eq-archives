I do. I don't always fight right next to the zone...not always possible.

depends on your class, I suppose. 3 seconds of a high level MOB (or multiple
mobs if I'm AE kiting) beating on me can seriously injure, if not kill me.

Took me two hours to get mine. it's random. it can take 6 minutes, or 6
days, or 6 weeks.

in my experiences (trying to get them for myself or for others in my guild),
on Tarew Marr,  the AC in OOT is not camped all that often.

that useful to me as long as they have that casting time.
