the *first* day wizards were allowed to crit- as soon as the servers were
done patching, i logged in, and i sat with my wizard blasting things, hoping
to get a crit, and i went through 3 bars of mana before i saw one, and it
was for less than my maximum

but they weren't broken, so...there's never a hole in the pot even if you
see one (at least with verant / sony [who was in charge when wizzy crits
started?] )

or something...
