Excellent news, we look forward to the journey. We will probably alternate
between our two armor quests, although arguably it would make more sense to
get hers first.

We don't mind hard, and indeed we can be patient, but "insanely rare" is
troubling. Still, Barbarians are made of stubborn stock and we will give it
a good shot. The Forest giants of Warslik Woods have not seen the last of
us, either.

And yet these pieces are also drops from creatures, yes? If one were
inclined to buy the gems, why wouldn't one simply buy the armor in the
Bazaar? These are difficult questions that are resolved best after a bottle
of stout and a good hunt. I'm not sure this thick Barbarian skull has it
figured out just yet.

Indeed, I'm glad that they are of an epic scale. This is why we came to the
fight!

Thank you, we will seek out information on these locations and prepare for
battle forthwith! I note that you are in our community of Firiona Vie, I
hope to see you on the battlefields one day!
