I spent 35-40 in Sol B (Pool Room groups to start, then moved
to the King Room groups).  I leveled so fast that every time
my guildmates did a /who on me and saw I had gained another
yet level, I kept getting "you suck" tells.

Yes, you have to group in Sol B at those levels, but there
are ALWAYS groups there with fast enough turnover that you'll
soon get a spot in the group.

Plus, it's not far from a city (Neriak if you're evil,
Freeport if you're good), and to simply sell the big
loads of Fine Steel and mushrooms/herbs that you'll
get, the Druid Ring merchant in Lavastorm is friendly
to all and is just a VERY short walk from the Sol B
entrance.

On top of all that, if things to go hell the zone-out
is always close if you need to run for it, AND the
Pool Room has a handy "back door exit" from the zone
that's just seconds away.

If I had it to do over again?  Sol B.  Fast, easy, safe
exp, and good cash loot.
