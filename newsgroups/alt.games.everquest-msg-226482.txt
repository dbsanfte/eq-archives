The difference is that you can get the 6 pack for around 2-5 bucks if 
you don't want the gas. You don't have that option with EQ2 beta.

And, in my view, the fact that there is a free public beta running is a 
non-issue, because the slots for that are allegedly quite limited, so 
entrance along that route is unreliable at best. (After all if they 
weren't quite limited there would be no value add to getting a slot with 
LoE). Getting into the beta that way is like winning the lotto... if you 
were at that gas station eyeing the coke, but didn't own a car... being 
told that coke isn't sold separately (anywhere) but that the store was 
holding a draw and was awarding a few 6packs would hardly assuage you as 
an adequate alternative to get a few cans of the "The ideal brain 
tonic". [1880s coca-cola slogan :) ]
