 Not having quizzed every Ranger in my guild I'm of the same opinion. I
think if you compared a Monk and Ranger with similar level equipment,
the Monk would have the higher AC. While not being the 1400-1500ac of
some of our tanks I break 1300 when fully buffed. I wouldn't exactly
call it "piss poor AC".  Having said that though, I'm not deluded enough
to call myself a tank.
