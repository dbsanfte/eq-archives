I suggest you just delete your chars when you die so you can be happy.

FYI: Back in D&D death didnt mean death either. Sometimes there where places
where you couldn't get out of it, but remember, there are usually temples
where they will ressurect for hard plat, and if the DM was being hard, you
might have to do a quest for it, or just use a Raise Dead spell. If you had
an evil wizard or cleric he could even animate dead and let you roleplay his
zombie for the rest of the evening :-)Beats sitting down on the coach for
the rest of the evening.

I do know that their are many different D&D roleplaying techniques and rules
which some groups allow and others disallow etc. It sounds like you guys
missed alot of the fun if thats how you played with your friends.
