It seems pretty reasonable to me.  Say you want to have 5 nodes max up at a
given time in a given zone.  If you just had 5 independent node spawn
points, it would be very easily predictable--camp these 5 spots for nodes.

If, however, you had 5 sets of linked nodes, each linked group having 5
spawn points, for example, you'd have 25 places where nodes could spawn,
with only 5 being up at any given time.  There would still be patterns, but
not as obvious as before.

Ideal would probably be to have linked sets that can be set up to have more
than one up.  E.g., a linked set of 25 where any 5 can be up at any given
time.  However, the method above gives a good practical approximation to
that, and might be technically easier on the server, depending exactly on
how the server works.
