Working on my bard alt's epic, my friends and I are routinely doing
Phinigel.

Cast:
65 Ranger
65 Cleric
65 Wizard > me
65 Enchanter > me again twoboxing

Sequence of events:
Enchanter loads Pacification
Wizard casts Improved Invisibility
Wizard steps off ledge, drifts down, targets first seahorse
Enchanter /assists wizard, pacifies
Wizard targets next seahorse
Enchanter repeats
Wizard targets third and fourth seahorses
Enchanter repeats and repeats
Wizard drifts down far enoug to aggro Phinney, then swims straight up to cei
ling and back to ledge
Phinney nukes wizard twice, then warps or swims to ledge
Ranger aggro's Phinney and proceeds to kick his scaley butt while Wizard
unloads nukes (cold extremely resisted, magic so-so, fire takes every time)
Phinney drops more stuff we don't need (we're having fire sales on Wizard
staff MQs)

Time from first pacify to Phinney dead: 15 minutes on average.  Takes longer
to swim everyone in.

We have done this several times with a shaman for a healer, and a 63 warrior
for the tank - I had to nuke more gently to avoid stealing aggro.
