Bingo.  I'll accept that accusation.  Dead on.  "Been there, done that."
For those of you who haven't been through the lower levels a few dozen times
already, for those who haven't seen the excitement that is available in the
higher levels, and for those who simply want to continue to play at the
level where a wizard is swinging a stick, your opinion has some merit.  For
me, it doesn't.
