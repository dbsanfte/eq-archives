I seriously doubt if you're all THAT knowledgeable about computers either.
It kinda sounds like you have an inflated sense of ego where you're much
more likely to be average, even when it comes to security on the internet.
I'd suggest you stop trying to sound like an expert and just let this
extremely silly topic die.  If you had your account "hacked," chances are
you're the one who fucked up and forgot THE most important security
precautions...DON'T WRITE DOWN YOUR PASSWORDS AND DON'T GIVE THEM TO ANYONE.

Hacked accounts are so rare on the internet as to be realistically
non-existent when these 2 basic precautions are taken.

Are you wrong or lying? It's one or the other.
