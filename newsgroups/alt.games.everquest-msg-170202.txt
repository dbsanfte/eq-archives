If you don't know the zone, RUN IT YOURSELF.  You ain't going to learn a
zone by autofollowing...it won't happen.

Clue: those who don't know a zone are a DRAG on those who do.  But, as
things happen, it's very impractible to assume that everyone knows every
zone. Sooo, there will always be zone newbies.

But...if you're AFing and you're one of the zone newbies, keep in mind that
there are at least a few others REALLY pissed at you for being a lazyass.
