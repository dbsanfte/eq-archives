While the pets seem to be powerful, the Beastlord has melee skills built
on melee lines, not the *4 of the healer or *3 of the int caster, while
lacking dual attack, the rest of the skill set is there for some hefty
melee output.  It seems to me that while a beastmaster may do only 3/4
the damage of a comperably outfitted warrior or monk, sitting back
and casting spells is far from his most productive strategy.  If his
pet is indeed more powerful than a mage or necro pet, then its doing
3/4 the damage a warrior is as well... and the pair would be doing
1 1/2 a warriors's damage, while slowing the target (absent a real slower)
and being capable of between fights healing.

Of course my opinion is colored by the fact that I just spent a couple
days leveling up to 9 with no spells... now that I finally have that pet
to help and a handful of spells to play with, we'll get busy looking
into that theory.
