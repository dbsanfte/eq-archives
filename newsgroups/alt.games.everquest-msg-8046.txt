You shouldn't have any difficulty if you can get an invis in SolA, get
behind him, then Sneak/buy from him.  Make sure that you have 115 CHA
though...the price'll be high enough as it is because of the Indifferent
/con (guessing 5500)....

Hmm, there is someone or something in there with him...I can't remember what
or where it is.  But you'll know soon enough when you get there whether or
not you can get away with sneaking.

...Or you could start hunting in SolB killing dogs...kill enough of them and
you should be able to wander anywhere you'd like in the gnome section of
SolA.
