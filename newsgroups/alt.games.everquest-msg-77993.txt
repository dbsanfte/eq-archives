Would be moot, people just ask in /ooc if they don't know and someone
usually answers them.

Not very, people vote in whatever price they want to and sometimes
just try to lower or raise it. They do the same on allakhazams.


>3. Would you use such a service?

Nope. My prices are pretty arbitrary anyway. To me nothing in the game
is even worth 9 k plat, thats just a ridiculous amount of money. I
never sell stuff for that much and certainly never would pay that
much. The most I ever paid for an item really was 4 k and  a fishbone
earring for a 30 ac 50 hp etc barbed ringmail tunic, the only reason
why I paid that was because I was complaining about the outrageous
prices people wanted and said I'd pay 4 k and a fishbone earring for
one but sure as heck not 9 k and someone in my guild went "okay I'll
take that deal" because they really wanted a fishbone earring.
