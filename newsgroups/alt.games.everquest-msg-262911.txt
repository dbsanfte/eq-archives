    You go to WoS not for the XP, but for the named mobs. If he can't tank 
them, why bother being in WoS versus somewhere else like murkglider caves?

    It's crummy of them to ask, especially the way they do, but I can 
understand why they do it. Every cleric out there has CH, and if the warrior 
isn't CH-able, you won't have success.
