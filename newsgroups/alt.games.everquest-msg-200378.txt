KEI is Kodiac's Endless Intellect cast by Lvl 61 or higher enchanter and it
is like regeneration for your mana.It's priceless as a caster - speeds your
ability to cast a great deal and cuts down your downtime immensely. You can
find people casting it for donations in the nexxus or Plane of Knowledge
usually.

A "nerfed" items is an item that Sony has decided is too good or too
powerful and so they degrade it in some way (for example, something with
unlimited charges may get nerfed to ten charges.

Hope these help.
