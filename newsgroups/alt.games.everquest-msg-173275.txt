I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one :-) I agree
that there are few, if any, "universal truths" about human behaviour.
I still think the original phrasing makes it a statement about a "universal
truth"... but I also accept that you did not intend for it to be one,
and that you intended it as a general principle rather than as a universal
truth.

At this point we're not arguing over what you intended to say; I probably
agree with what you intended to say. We're arguing over what you actually
*did* say. We're probably better off leaving such quibbles to lawyers
and such folk. But sometimes I can't resist. :-)

That particular cliche is widely misinterpreted. There's a decent
explanation here:
    http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-exc1.htm
To paraphrase the correct original meaning: To say that something is
permitted under certain circumstances implies that a rule exists to
disallow it when those circumstances do not exist.

For example, "parking permitted on Tuesdays" implies that parking is
*only* permitted on Tuesdays.

There's another interpretation of "proves" = "tests" but I think the
explanation at the above link provides a much better foundation and
is itself more reasonable.

The reason why such (illogical, as commonly interpreted) rules enjoy
such widespread acceptance is the fact that many people don't think
about what they're saying, particularly where cliches are concerned.
Or as others have put it "Man is a rationalising animal, not a
rational animal"... another "universal truth" which is frequently
false, but contains enough truth to be illuminating.

But in any case, I very much agree that universal "truths" regarding
human behaviour tend to be deeply flawed. I think it's one reason why
a few of us jumped on your original statement - it appeared to be making
such a statement about human behaviour.

We're all trying to stay civil. That's usually a good start. :-) We're
not flaming, just disagreeing, and nobody is going out of their way to
be abusive.
