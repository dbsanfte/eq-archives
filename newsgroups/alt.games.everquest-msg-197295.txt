You might instead cry yourself to sleep over the fact that the obvious 
eludes you so. If your guild expects you to devote over half your time to 
helping others get flagged, then you're in the wrong guild. Less than that 
is closer to what you should be more than willing to offer to help others 
in the guild. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure that out.

Like I said, it stands to reason that the more people that get flagged, the 
less burden should be placed on any one member.
