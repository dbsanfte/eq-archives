2 seconds is /pause 20

The formula is 10x the number of seconds you wanted to pause

However there's often system lag of a couple tenths of a second, so at 
very low numbers you can get some funny results, not so much with a 
simple rotation key, but if, for example, you were trying to build a key 
to cast several spells in a row, the minimum pause that you have to put 
between them will not be what you'd expect, nor will just copying 
someone else's pause length necessarily work for you, you have to 
experiment to discover what works on  your system.
