That's the direction I'm hoping to move in: more exploring and
experiencing.  It's hard to do at the lower levels, though, since
I can't defend myself when I come upon unexpected baddies like the
Drachnids.  I realize that the game shouldn't be a cake-walk,
though, or it wouldn't be much of a game :^)
