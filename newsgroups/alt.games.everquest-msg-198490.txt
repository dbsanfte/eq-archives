oh so helpful when you are oom and don't even have enough mana to cast 
camo.  I always hide instead of camo if I'm just gonna sit there and 
med.  Hide doesn't wear off unless you move.  Camo wears off every time 
the big nasty monster is pathing right next to you.
One tip I've learned in the newsgroup is to try to target myself when 
hidden to check if hide worked.  That is the easiest way to make sure it 
  worked.  Just because you can't see yourself in alternate view doesn't 
mean you are actually hidden.

Do that all the time, it's nice to be able to port back to PoK anytime I 
want, sell, bank and then gate or run back to where I was fighting.

Come across that alot too, I sometimes run my hubby's ranger and get 
jealous of the damage he does.  But I wouldn't trade my druid for 
anything at this point.
