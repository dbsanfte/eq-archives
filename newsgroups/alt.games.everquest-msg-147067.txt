These are opinions, and you're certainly welcome to disagree. I think
spirocs are a fine quadding candidate, and I did them myself for a
couple levels in the late forties, particularly when the ulthorks were
over camped. But as you say, unless you have killer gear, they are
likely too much for many wizards at 44, and I don't care how good you
are, a bunch of proven adds can ruin your day. Far faster and nastier
than any ulthork warrior. But on to your points.

They don't wander that far. And the wide open area is actually favorable
to the less experienced quadder. Lots of room for roundup which makes it
easier if you are learning the fine points.

Not a factor here until the walrus turn green. They all (walrus, hunter,
warrior) run at exactly the same speed, both snared and full tilt. They
are also ALL social with each other. The walrus will defend the Ulthork
and vice versa, and will keep coming in a pack until all but one are
dead.

Snaring the odd snow bunny can be a logistical pain, but they die on the
first AoE so it's no biggie. Plus snow bunny meat is used in the Coldain
shawl three. Anyhow, they're so darned cute it's just fun to kill them.
(Oh, and I *DO* have the holy hand grenade of antioch. It's a rare drop
off seargeant Slate. :-p )

First, you left out the watchers, which are your bread and butter.
Second, there's a nice even mix of walrus, hunters, and warriors in EW.
The Spirocs, in my experience, have WAY too high a pecentage of
lightfoots (lightfeet?) for any given spawn spot, so they actually green
out pretty early.

Again, I completely disagree. Maybe you have bad luck with the RNG, but
spirocs only drop a little more plat than ulthorks. (Ok, the walrus loot
sucks.) But if you also save up the weapons that the Ulthork drop and
sell them, I made more cash on them than I did on spirocs, where all you
get besides cash is bone dust and research components.  Plus, as you
say, the lottery. I got no less than a half dozen blue diamonds on that
damned lottery during my quadding days there, and tons of other nice
vendor trash gems. I made a ton of cash there.

Both areas can easily be overcamped, but that's the same with any choice
area, sadly.

FYI.. there's no Raptors on Xev for the next couple months. They all
moved to Jersey. So don't bother coming by.
