I was level 40 or so before I started making reasonable amounts of cash.
Say at level 30, most MOBs drop 1 plat or less after the split. We were
not taking down 50 MOBs per hour as I recall. Soloing I could take down a
MOB every ten minutes or so, making maybe ten plat an hour if I was lucky.
Maybe this would have been faster with KEI, but I didn't know the spell
existed until my mid-30s. Perhaps it didn't exist... this was around
September last year I think.

I was around level 46 before ever getting KEI, and level 52 or so before
paying for it (because PoI without KEI or *some* form of mana regen is
tough, I'll agree).

Perhaps I'm speaking in terms of a historical perspective, pre-bazaar,
when selling tradeskill silks was not an option and earning cash at low
levels was genuinely difficult. In which case, you're right, but I think
I'm a better cleric for having learned this sort of thing early.

Many things in the game that you need to learn, are best learned in
conjunction with mana conservation rather than independent of it. Not to
mention the basic techniques of mana conservation itself - the "sitting
reflex" which still kicks in underground for example. :-)

But things like picking who to heal, and when... and the really tough ones
like who to allow to die, and who you *must* keep alive.

This is a fair point. Levelling up I didn't find it too tough finding
groups but the low-end zones are pretty empty these days.

If you need an extra minute or two of downtime on every pull you need
to learn, oh, for example, mana conservation. :-)

Yay Breeze! I remember the first time I ever got a Breeze... didn't know

Most of my clericking career I've been grouped killing blue/white MOBs
with the occasional yellow... and for that usually med breaks are minimal.
One of my fondest memories is of a group at the Overthere ledge in my 30s
which was chain pulling the MOBs as fast as we could kill them, earning
exp at an insane rate and stopping only to buff. Without any mana buffs
at all.

I'm not saying that KEI isn't useful; it is. The trouble is that it has
transformed the low-end game in such a way that the players with it are
super-players, and the players without it cannot find a group at all.

Somebody explicitly saying that they do not take KEI is telling me that
they care about learning to play their character properly. That seems to
me to be a good thing. Grouping with them would carry its own
advantages. Perhaps we would not exp as quickly, but I would have more
confidence in them because I know that they can handle their job without
"artificial" assistance.

One thing I have noticed is that the universal *demand* for KEI has
only really started since PoP opened up the "world", simply because it's
now so much easier to reach the Nexus. When PoP came out there were many
people bemoaning how PoP "shrunk" the world. At this relatively late stage
I don't think that travel is the main impact of PoP at low levels. The
main impact has been in concentrating *players*, in particular making
the mass "sale" of buffs such as KEI practical.

In doing so it has made the low-end game much tougher for genuine newbies
who know little about the Nexus or the bazaar.

In many ways I *hate* what KEI has done to the game. It has its place, but
the way it is actually used distorts the game past recognition. My concern
is that if it is nerfed, those who have become used to rapid levelling
with KEI will abandon the low levels altogether and leave the associated
zones deserts devoid of any players except the odd 50+ on their way to
another zone. We're almost there already.
