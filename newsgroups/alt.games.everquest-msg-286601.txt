Thanks guys - that was it ... i thought maybe i logged off in a corner
of the zone that became extinct after some zone revamp, though really
that would have just plopped me in a safe spot or something. So i
removed some zonefiles and repatched, but it was those custom UI files
that did it. Logged in no problem, thanks!

And i have a new problem - my animations are all bugged like crazy.
Figured it was drivers, updated my drivers, but it wasn't that. It
reminds me of a d3d issue i had with another game, but i'm not sure
how to fix it (updating the drivers is all that i thought of doing).
What gives? I had it on a few characters, then it went away, and now i
have it again. If i sit, i seem to remain standing (though i'm
sitting, can open spellbook/camp, etc...), if i run my legs don't
move, if i spin i spin slowly slooooowly FAST FAST fast slooooooow
(etc etc). Just buggy motions all around, can't even float evenly.

Thanks much.

P.S. I'm getting the feeling there is very little room for pickup
groups, it's all raids or small niches of people. Is that right?
Should i try to revive some RL friends to have them rejoin the game,
or should i just start up a new character on a newbie-friendly server?
I'd really love to have like 3 or 4 people to play with regularly
(EST). And i might love starting an alt ^_^
