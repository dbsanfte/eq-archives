I played in stages - the first year I never had a character out
of the 20's.  My bard (my first main) took 20 days played to get 
into his 20's.  I saw almost every dungeon and outdoor zone 
available to those ranges.

At some point though, I wanted to see bigger badder things so I
buckled down and leveled and started on my epic (never finished
it, whoever designed the mage epic quest needs to be shot - it's
not the difficulty that got me, it was the tedium of Hate over
and over again without even being able to use my pet).  I was in
a neat family guild, and we put together raid after raid to help
folks get their epics (my friends and I became quite a reaver
killing team :) )

Then PoP came, and flagging started to split our small guild up,
then it disappeared and I found my self in an up and coming raiding
guild.  I finally hit the cap while it was still the cap and tried 
out the beginnings of the high end game - just to find that, when 
there were over 30 people in one spot it became far less fun.  The
phrase "cat herding" comes to mind.  Loved our 3 group mini-raids
though.  

Looking back at it, no one stage was better than another, it's just
that they are different parts of the game, and I feel I got a huge
amount out of enjoying each part -- Now I'm getting the same enjoyment
out of WoW - I don't have a single character over 20 (although almost
one of every class in the teens).  At some point my mods will be as
feature complete as they need to be and anything else I might think
I need will have been written and I'll have seen all the newbie areas
and early hunting grounds.  Then it'll be time to get those characters
up to their 40's and 50's for instances.  Then, who knows :)  Hero
classes are on the distant horizon, more raids are added day by day.

It's not completely new, nothing will ever be like EQ was in the early
days.  But hey, things are pretty decent.
