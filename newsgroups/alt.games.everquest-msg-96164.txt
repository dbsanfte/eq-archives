Not much now. My dark elf cleric of 36 grouped with an sk of 53 in
skyshrine. I think we were right at the new xp cuttoff. I still got
fantastic xp in the time we were there.

It doesn't really matter if the monk is getting more, since the mobs
are worth more to you at 39 than the level 36-39 mobs you might be
doing with a tank of that level. Have fun and don't worry about it.
You are really getting the better end of the deal since you'll be
gaining more of your total level's xp bar than the monk will,
regardless of the number amount.
