Now *that's* funny! I remember my first time there. I didn't realize the
platforms were so high, or that auto-follow kind of liked to use the
"shortest distance between 2 points is a straight line" theory. I went
right over the edge after the person I was following crossed to another
platform. Made quite the sickening crunch as I hit the ground and died.
It also reminds of this one guy I group with. My character is no speed
demon and gets tired from running, but following this guy gives me a
headache. Actually, I should say "trying" to follow this guy. He is
running around so fast and chaotically that by the time I find him and
catch up to him he's already looting corpses of targets that he's killed
and I haven't even seen yet. And he doesn't slow down for anything. I
spend most of the grouping time trying to figure out where he is, but at
least I'm getting xp! <g>
