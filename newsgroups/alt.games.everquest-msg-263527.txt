   I know.  I was trying to be polite.  Because really, it's hard for me to
think of a nice way to say "I'll talk to whomever I please".  Really, the
phrase has a snotty ring to me.  But that is how I feel about it.

    I snip as needed.  It isn't really my responsibility to make sure that
you are shielded from those you have plonked.  By this logic no one should
reply to anyone that anyone else in the newsgroups has plonked.

   I appreciate that.  In fact, that is why I was trying to find a polite
way to respond your request.  I don't want to start a flame war or anything
with you, but I do feel it really isn't your place to tell me whom it is
okay for me to speak to.  I know, I tend to be a stubborn that way, and it
might not be my best trait.
