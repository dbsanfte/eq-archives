At today's densities, a 1.3TB fibre channel SAN (10*172GB SCA, 1 hot spare
RAID5) would take up 4U (about 18cm) of rack space and cost under US$25k.
The actual SAN chassis capable of this would have been available during EQs
development, and storage could be added as larger capacity target drives
became available.

I have no idea what EQ actually uses for its data store, but a shared fibre
channel SAN would be my initial guess.
