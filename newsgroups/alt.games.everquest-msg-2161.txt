That wasn't always the case. Kendrick was a beta tester who done himself
proud. Beforehand and for some time, Rogues were largely ignored. I have
seen various other representatives poke their heads up on to the boards,
but that can also be attributed to the meteoric rise in readership and
standing of the Safehouse.

Not to mention Rogues are privy to some information in the root cellar
from him, and we still like to bounce ideas around.

I feel they should nominate such a figurehead for each class, so that at
least players of all trades feel they have a voice at Verant HQ, and
aren't just howling into the wilderness in the hope of being heard.
Surely Verant's staff have players interested in classes other than
Necromancers and Rogues? They could even go far enough as to pick one
from the playerbase, preferably a highly thought of player in their
respective community, and not an arriviste upstart or a spokesdroid.
