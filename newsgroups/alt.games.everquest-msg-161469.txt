Yadda, yadda, yadda.

Now that you've gotten your partisan horseshit out of the way,
why don't you read the decision and tell us where you think
the "conservative dominated" Supreme Court made an error of law?

We'll wait.

And by the way, the vote to kick the Florida Supreme Court's
decision into the trash can (a very proper decision, from my
reading of the Constitution and the law -- you know, those
things which the Supreme Court is supposed to follow, and
which the Democrats never seem to care about if they get
in the way of winning) was 7-2.

You'll note that the "conservative dominated" Supreme Court
is *not* conservative by a 7-2 margin.  Please explain,
if you're capable of deeper analysis than you've demonstrated
in the post to which I am responding.
