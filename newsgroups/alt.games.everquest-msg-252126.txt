Click on Options, use the General tab, and you will see a toggle button to
make it so you won't stand when you move forward. I can't recall right now
the exact name of the button, but it should be pretty obvious. No need for a
work around or to search; it's right there in Options. :)

That does suck that happened to you, but hey, things like that happen to us
all. Ever snared yourself as a druid in wolf form? *grin* Not only does it
totally snare you, it also removes wolf form, which if you're in a KOS area,
but indifferent because of wolf form, can be quite bad. :)

Hehe...worse thing I can recall doing in my current carnation is to cast a
complete heal on the mob we're fighting, not realizing even though I call
out c heals and the intended target, and almost letting the tank die as a
result. :P
