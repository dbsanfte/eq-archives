*grumble* Well, as long as you don't slow down traffic by doing this, I
forgive you.  NOthing wrong with being opportunistic, as long as you don't
harm the overall flow of traffic for your own (often infintesimal)
advantage.  It has been proven that cars jockeying for that most forward
position and the lane hopping that goes with it is responsible for most
non-accident traffic jams.

Ditto. :)

Exactly. :) Once I looked at the regs, it was confirmed that the opinion
of that "highly knowledgeable guy" (he's the guy in the office everyone
goes to to get definitive answers) was incorrect.  Reminded me of why I
insist on seeing the regs first-hand in any matter that involves laws.
You are correct, moving traffic always has the right of way in California
according to law.  However, the number of people that believe otherwise
definitely DOES explain why I see the behavior that I do.

NOt to mention that the driver's handbook is really obscure at times. I
blame Arnold. :P
