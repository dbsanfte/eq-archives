Monks, rogues, and warriors can all bind wounds
to 70% at a skill level of 201, which is not possible
until level 51 is obtained.  My lower-level  rogue
has BW already at 200 skill, but won't be able to
work with the improvement until about 4 more
levels...and even then, she'll have to hit 201 skill
first.
