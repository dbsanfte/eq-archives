You make it sound like that 'unless' would be rare. IME most ubergeared 
tanks at 26 are at least 2 of the three above.

Ok.

No, you said... "I, too, think everyone should get a chance, but not at 
the expense of the entire group." That's a very broad statement, if the 
guy has 1 skill in his weapon, and cloth armour then yeah its at the 
expense of the entire group, and not even worth pursuing... but if the 
guy has a finesteel weapon, decent weaponskill, and has completed his 
newbie quests... what then? Letting him MT is still 'at the expense of 
the entire group'.

After all, he's still no where near the 'capability' of the other guy 
dual wielding wurmslayers, in pop armour....

So when exactly does he get his chance? When he's the most capable MT? 
When do you see that happening?
