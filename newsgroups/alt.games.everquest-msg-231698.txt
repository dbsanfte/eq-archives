What, you mean one of the best-selling games of all time? Yup, they
did. Okay, by TODAY'S standards, Diablo may be sub-standard. But,
remember, it is close to 10 years old. D2 outsold D1, even, and has
been pretty highly regarded by the majority of the gaming community.

YOU not liking something doesn't make it "sub-standard".
