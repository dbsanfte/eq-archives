    ...what happened to us last night.

    We go to fight the Emperor in Ssra, the toughest mob we kill. This will
be the trip that finally completes rifts (a component for the key to Vex
Thal) for all our members that we're keying. We fight the good fight, and
the clerics even cover when a CH cleric has to go AFK (her daughter was
having her first period). We keep one main tank alive all fight, and with a
record low number of deaths for us (less than 5) we win. Loot is announced -
Shawl of Awakenings, ring of analogies, and the FT: IV slippers. I'm not due
for loot this fight, but two of those items are awesome cleric items and it
looks like the CH team is finally going to be rewarded for working so hard.
I've just KS'ed the first Shissar Wraith in the room from an officer ( hey,
I need XP too ;-) ) when I abruptly see "YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED". No
lag, just boom, gone.

    Quellious crashed.

    All the rifts, all the drops, the Garrison's Superior Sundering for one
of our wizards - gone, not able to be reimbursed as no record of our getting
the items exists.

    We'll kill him again, of course - that's what we do. And we will get
those people without rifts their rifts, and our wizards will eventually all
have GSS. But it was still painful to see all that hard work wiped out,
especially when we knew the reward.

    James
