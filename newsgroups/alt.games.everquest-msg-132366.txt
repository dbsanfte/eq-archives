I assume you're a cleric by signature.  I dunno why folks wanna PL a Cleric.
It's like trying to PL a Wizzy.  The class is not meant to stand toe-2-toe
with a mob.  You neither have the HP nor the dmg output for it.  Now,
Clerics can PL others like nobody else.  Reminder, you either group friendly
or solo class.  Cleric is group friendly.

I suggest you get in a group in High Keep War room.  So long as you can
heal, then it dont matter that you not high enough to give dmg.  Remain in
groups where the mobs are either yellow or Red.  XP will work great to your
advantage.  Or, group with toons where you're Yellow or Red to them.

best chance to win both ways.
