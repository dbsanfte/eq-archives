Best chain style hood I can think of is Rygorr, not sure what it looks like
on DE's as I never wore mine, just sold it (SSB is better and I like the
plate look of the DE's armour)
Banded on DE's looks like some kind of skull cap to me but the looking at
the fashion table on allakhazam's there appears to be no head graphic for
the Rygorr coif, bonus.

There is no entry for Kylong armour which is prolly because there is no
chest piece for it (is there?)
