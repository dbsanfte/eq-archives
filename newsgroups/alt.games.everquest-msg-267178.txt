I usually had pretty good luck with the kill the PH's theory, by staying 
in one general area and killing the PH's there.  At first this wouldn't 
go so well, I'd be killing a lot of PH's that spawned somewhere else. 
But soon enough, most of the PH's I killed were ones that spawned in my 
area, and the HG's would spawn there too.  I made a point of engaging 
PH's even if I already had a HG or two engaged, because I wanted to keep 
killing PH's that spawned in my area before they wandered off.

Of course it helped that I was desperately too high for the area by the 
time I bothered with it, if it had been difficult to kill two cyclops, a 
HG, and a couple basilisks simultaneously, this plan might have been 
harder to implement.
