Did one of us misread it? I don't think they implied that the whole
expansion was gonna be instanced dungeons that would only be available
to groups. Although granted if it's all dungeons then there might not
be many solo opportunities for a timid soloist. Although even a
'dungeon' expansion like LoY has plenty of spots to solo, Gunthak,
Dulak, Nadox all have a lot of solo spots. Not sure about Torrigan's
but Hate's Fury is the only zone I've seen that you can't really solo.
