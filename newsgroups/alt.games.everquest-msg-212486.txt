In which case we're left with these obvious choices:
(a) I'm wrong (my logic fails at some point)
(b) I've failed to explain myself (indistinguishable from (a) to you)
(c) You've failed to understand the idea I'm attempting to convey
(d) You're wrong (your inference below is not justified)
(e) It's just too damned annoying trying to argue this with inadequate
tools (English), and besides the whole thing just smells too much like
philosophical hair-splitting to be fun anymore.
