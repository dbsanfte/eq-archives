LoIO, FM, CC, GD, EW, Iceclad. If you don't care about loot, DP is okay.

It seems that PC is the only decent under-50 zone in all of Luclin. All 
the other zones don't really give that much exp and almost no loot and 
the MOBs all hit harder and have more HP than equivalent level MOBs in 
older zones.
