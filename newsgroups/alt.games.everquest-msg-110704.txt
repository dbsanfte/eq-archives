Now a quick review from me...I got them last night.

I haven't configured it completely yet.  I bought a second transmitter (btw,
I got no Velcro for my IR port thing :( ) because I almost always dual-wield
computers.

On my Dell 8100 the glasses just fluttered
some...3d...2d..3d.2d....3d...very annoying.  Unlike Rich Lipschitz, I
wasn't able to find a phone number anywhere on their site or else I'd call
them.  I assumed it was a bad battery or something on the glasses, but I was
wrong.

I went ahead & set it up on one of my home-builds and set-up worked like a
charm, so obviously there's nothing wrong with the glasses.  There's nothing
wrong with the base (cord & dongle) either, because I swapped them between
computers.

In game:  Like I said, I haven't gotten it configured completely yet.  The
boxes are all still 3d, so I'll try that Umbra trick.  My gnome walked under
an NPC's raised sword and looked up and it looked great. :)

Both computers are using the latest nVidia drivers.  Both are GeForce2
MX-400s.

BTW, it looks like nVidia's 3d drivers also support the red/green glasses.
If you have a pair of these laying around you might want to try that
first...it'd save ya $100 if you like them.

The glasses don't have any software at all if you have an nVidia card.  The
software you install is simply nVidia's 3d drivers.

Is it worth it?  Dunno, ask me in a couple weeks.
