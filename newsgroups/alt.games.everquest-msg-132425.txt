Minus five points:  You claim me to be a newbie, and offer for proof that
you think I'm blowing things out of proportion.  Evidence does not fit
premise.

Minus five points:  It's pefectly acceptable to write the mayor and ask the
graffiti to be removed.

Hmm, you seem to have done some google research to find bits and pieces
about me.  I'm wondering, are you trying to 1)  Imply familiarity, 2)  Show
that you know how Deja-Google works, or 3)  Trying to seem all threatening
"I know stuff about you nya nay!"?  Maybe you can shed some light on this?

Oh, and while you're looking stuff up, I really suggest looking up the
definition of "troll."

Cox is not obligated to carry all, or even any of the newsgroups.

I'll tell you what, why don't you wait for Cox to tell me "take it or leave
it"?  It's their right to answer or refuse my request as they will.

I love this statement.  It's funny how those who find time to post on usenet
can still see fit to criticise me for posting on usenet.  If you were
following your own advice, we wouldn't be having this discussion.  Or was
this just another attempt to show that you "found something out" about me.
Sorry, I'm not intimidated.  Hell, post my home address if you have it, I
really don't care.

It's a matter of what you seem to think you're entitled to.

Ah, and we finally get to bashing my faith.  Just a little bit of biggotry,
neh?  Kind of a pathetic way to end an empty argument, showing your own
shallowness.
