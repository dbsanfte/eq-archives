Fair enough. But then I find raiding a particular encounter tedious and 
stupid after the first couple times too.

EQ as a game is terribly repetitive across all scales and activities.

Its just a matter of whether or not you are enjoying the degree of 
'tedium and stupidity' you are faced with. I, for one, will always have 
more fun playing pacman for an hour than tradeskilling in EQ1. So the 
new tradeskill interface strikes me as a decided improvement.

Hell... after an 8 hour raid... I'd actually look forward to an hour of 
PacMan.

To each their own, I guess.
