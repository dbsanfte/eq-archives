If you want be pedantic  you could at least mention that 'hackers' and
'hacking' traditionally means non-malevolent computer wizardry.  In
contemporary usage both 'hacking' and 'cracking' mean causing harm to
an unauthorized server, usually, and DDoS attacks certainly fall under
that mantle.  It certainly would be necessary to 'hack' other
servers/hosts to gain access to enough bandwidth to DoS a company
running game servers of the magnitude that verant is.
