Knew a druid who did that while quadding othmirs. Kill a camp, port to 
Misty, manastone up and use 75% heal till full of health and mana, port 
back and kill again.

Still got chance of loosing camp, and i personally can think of a lot of 
places not near a port spot where i would NOT like to be bound just to 
be able to get back (hey guys, ill go bind at our camp in PoN, cause 
theres no risk well wipe and ill be in a death loop.....splat, 4 levels 
lost to death loop)
