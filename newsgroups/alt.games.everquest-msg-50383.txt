OK, now you're being pedantic ):oP

Just because you CAN kill them with 6 people, what's the point of being
there more than twice from lack of keys. Spend a week or so
concentrating on first broods and go whack MotG at the very least heh

IMO Zlexak is the baddest mob in ToV. Vyemm is just a simple case of
agro-management and heal timing. Your MT lives long enough, you win -
simple. We've even killed Vyemm without a single non-pet death, and
since people know Vuulak is next up, attendance isn't usually a problem.
Zlex still causes CRs if we get unlucky or there's a little too much lag
to gauge breaths successfully. Ventani is a little contentious (wake
sleeper or leave another up, if so which do we leave up?) in the guild
right now. We've had one half-hearted attempt (first was a gung-ho
CHARGE! for the hell of it, second was more planned, but we got agro
wrong and he ate the healers (always a bad sign)) and know what's
needed, just DAoC has hit us hard
