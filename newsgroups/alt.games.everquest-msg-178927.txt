Autosplit, Meem.

Odd.  Well, in any case, if you want to raise it faster, it's like pick 
lock - it's faster to hit 'u' than to hit the skill key and wait for it 
to refresh.

Wow.  Most kids just sweet talk their parents into providing a credit 
card :D  I'd say skill-ups are not even remotely as 'fun' as 
tradeskills.  She should like poison though.  The skill-ups were coming 
fast and furious.  You can wait until 60 for poison though, you can't 
max it until then anyway.  Oh, and I might as well give you this now:

/join serverwide.rogue:rogue ;p  The odd time I visit it actually seems 
fairly quiet.  Questions are either not answered, or answered politely.

I'm trying, I'm trying.  10 1/2 more levels.

*I'd* pay to watch a mage try and solo...

Because if nobody else is, I pull the aggro.  And when I pull, I hate it 
when people aggro the mob before I've gotten it positioned how *I* like.  
One day when I'm bored I'll just fill up my inventory with fletching 
supplies and ask the people fighting rockhoppers in DSP if I can 
practice archery on them.

I know.  Damn tolans.  Still.  Keep a stack of each fletching component 
in your bags.  Insta-summon 100 arrows (or more, if you're using certain 
ones)

Here and there.  Slowest damn skill I've ever had to raise.  Worse than 
ID :p
