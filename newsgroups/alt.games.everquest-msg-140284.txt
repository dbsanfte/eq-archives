The Better weapon for a Beastlord, IMO, is Intel's Hammer +4wis 1hb and the
sort of ratio my Warrior would be happy with, 13/25. It looks cool too.
Unfortunately, Intel's Hammer is no longer dropped until Verant fix the
Sambata Tribal Advisor spawn in Dawnshrowd, it should be low 40's, Sambata,
Cleric but is currently a 60th level Erudite Necro, I assume it's a bug and
not intentional.
I don't know of any better 2hb than the Groaning that has that
graphic...There probably is but it'll drop in VT or somewhere similar :ï¿½)
