If there *is* any animation in first person, it's darn near invisible
then. But as both the subject line and the text of my original post and
follow ups make clear, these are *opinions* of one person who got the
chance to try it. Both good points and bad points. Whatever animations
occur in first person during melee are, (again, in my *opinion*) piss
poor and detract from that aspect of the game.

Humorous at best. Far from engaging in hyperbole (and you should look up
what that means, by the way, if you're going to use the word) and I
obviously couldn't be motivated to make my "case against DAoC" stronger,
as I have no case nor prejudice against it. We were the ones who signed
up for the beta, genius. I'm not going to waste that much time and hard
drive space on something like this just to make some "case" against it.
I tried it. There were good things about it, as I mentioned, and things
that I think need serious work. All opinions, and as many people here
are doubtless curious about the game but did not get in on the beta
testing, it seemed suitable to discuss. (The subject is labeled as being
"OT" by the way. That means "Off Topic" so any not caring to read about
non EQ matters can skip it and move on.)

Well, if you've cleared up the distinction between "zero first person
combat animations in melee combat" and "very little and piss poor
animations in first person melee combat" then I stand corrected and
thank you for taking the time to straighten that out.
