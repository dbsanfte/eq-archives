There is less chance for interaction. In COH all of the content is
pretty much instanced, though you can run around in the wild and kill
as well. Several archetypes are very good solo, you don't need anyone
for a resurrect or anything or to get your corpse.

Basically you could play COH as a totally solo game, never talk to a
single person and not miss out on any content. 

All you do is kill and level. There is no loot per se, you make enough
from selling Dual origins that drop to more than pay for all of your
origin upgrades. For example, my 27 mutant Dark/Regen scrapper has all
25 single origins except for the ones you get later which are all 30
SOS. I am waiting until 28 to combine the 25 SO's with 30 ones, so
they might be 31 (you can't combine them until 28, so I'm holding
off.) I'm about half through 27 with 350,000 plus influence and I
should have a lot more by the time I hit 28.

There is nothing that I'm missing, or that would improve me. 
I don't really need to talk to another player, nor do I need to two
box, I'm fine as I am and can destroy small groups of mobs or do fine
in missions alone (even against a boss who is orange - purple)

After level 20, every level seemed the same. I'm always as well
slotted with enhancements as I can be and I always have extra
influence. 

There is never anything more to get, or really much reason to make the
next level except to be a level higher. You add powers every so often,
but for classes like mine you reach a point where you pretty much
continue to mostly use the ones you already have. Eventually I'll be
adding things I won't even be likely to use, such as hover. 

It IS an mmorpg, but I understand the poster saying it isn't. It is
not the typical one since there is not much of a carrot to chase. What
COH is basically is:

Everquest if, through basic playing, your shadow knight could solo
fantastically from 1 -65 with zero downtime, while it got loot
upgrades every level automatically so it never had anything to shoot
for. 

It would be pretty much like automatically getting a cloak of flames,
or some such haste thing, at a level like 19 and then having it
continue to get faster innately. You'd also get the best weapons and
lifetaps, then they'd just automatically do more damage and give more
life. You'd get a few new spells here and there, but they'd be
automatic spells you picked rather than ones you had to buy or loot. 

Mobs would only give you money, or perhaps some random thing that
powered you up.

You'd have no reason to group with others, no corpse to loot, no need
of a resurrect and no reason to "camp" stuff. 

Now you might say, "hey, I'd like EQ if it was that way!" but really I
don't think you would. The problem is you'd log in and go through the
motions and be bored.

I find both games to be very flawed in totally opposite ways:

In COH, everything is handed to you and all you do is easily gain
levels.

In EQ, everything is hard and a huge downtime sink and you are always
behind in loot and maybe you don't have the time to go and camp
something that would really help you for 35 hours and maybe you can't
get a global village to help you get your epic or really gear you out.
You really REQUIRE other players to help you and group you, unless you
have 3 other accounts you can effectively multibox.

Its like COH was their answer to EQ, but it went way way overboard. In
doing so they forgot about longevity. COH is like if you started EQ
tomorrow, as a total newb, and playing EQ 1/50th as much as you do now
you were level 65 with 3000 AA points and the best gear in the game,
within 3 or 4 months. What would you do then? Exactly.
