The game is balanced for groups of players.
The game is balanced for levels of groups.
Zones and encounters are have been balanced specifically for power and 
level since the game rolled out.

KEI f**ks the low end games balance to hell and back.

Let me ask you a question how can you like a game that is "too slow" and if 
you do actually disslike it the why in hell are you still playing it all 
these years later ?

Btw the game is a chalange. Reducing the chalange reduces the reward.

HTH, now STFU,

Thanks

Jim
