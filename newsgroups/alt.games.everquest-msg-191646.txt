Oh, get over it. Just because it's possible there may be some
dishonest members doesn't mean the guild is "built on disloyalty,
dishonesty, and other gutless acts of thievery". You can drop the
elitist high and mighty act.

The fact is, you don't KNOW everyone in your guild is honest. They
could be backstabbing thieves, but just have never gotten caught and
are good enough bullshitters that you'd never suspect them. Just like
other people can be the most honest players in the world, but for some
reason are always the first to be accused...

No one's saying that it DID happen that one of your guildmates screwed
you. Just don't dismiss the possibility, because that would be
ridiculously naive to do.
