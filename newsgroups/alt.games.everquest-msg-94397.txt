You know, I have just recently heard about this new change to CT. And almost all things I
have read about it, they talk about this "exploration team" getting owned and how
impossible it will be to play now with unmezable mobs. And in every single thing I keep
reading, I have yet to see one key element in this "exploration team". That being where
were the rangers or druids? While I cannot for sure say it is the case either way, I
wonder about the true legitamacy of an "exploration team" to an outdoor zone that lacks
rangers or druids. Well, you never know.
