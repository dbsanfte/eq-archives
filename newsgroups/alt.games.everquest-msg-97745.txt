I don't let these things bug me.  My druid will be in a group, knee-deep in
critters in OT and have some happy camper start sending me tells for
ports/heals/sow/wolf-form .. whatever.  If I am medding for another
heal/dot/nuke -- I'll send a /r back - "Grouping ATM - They need my mana..
sorry"

About half of them go away, the others keep bellowing at me.  If I am not
grouping, guess what?  I am probably on my way to:

a) meet a group
b) buy/sell
c) meet friends
d) help guildies

I have a /r for people in those situations:  "Running to X, get back with me
in X mins" (depending on the request)

I am pretty liberal with SoW's when not in a group (unless kiting),
everything else, well, these two experiences jaded me:

1) The Monk's Woes (my main - 40 monk)

Lvl 40, a group asks me to join them for a jaunt in Keasora so I do.  We go
in, fight a few, round a corner to a "safe place" so the cleric can med, and
voila... 8 or so casting critters.  Cleric drops, ranger drops, I FD.  DOH!
Bad timing on my part... one of the mobs had just gotten a spell off.  1
dead monk at your service.

Bound in FV, the other two tell me they are bound in FoB and are arranging a
retrieval.  Then cleric will rez.  Cool.  an hour goes by with me practicing
my skills.  Group says "we got our bodies but have to go.. we'll try to help
you tomorrow..."  WTF?!?

Rather than pester my guildies, I start begging for a sow.  No dice.  (My
druid ALWAYS sows at buffs at banks... rarely do I get a thanks for it
though) I hoof it to FoB (almost an hour or so run w/ no sow).  I get there
finally and this guild is preparing for a raid.  I find out who the raid
leader is, explain my situation and he is shocked.

RaidLeader01:  "All you want is a sow and invis?"
CasonMonk01: "Yuppers.  I know where my bones are and I can flop my way
out."
RaidLeader01: "Heh.  Join group 3 and we'll rez u when we get that far."
CasonMonk01: "Much appreciation... got any low monks that need a CCS?"
RaidLeader01:  "Man you don't have to do that.."
CasonMonk01:  "Takes me a couple of hours to get one, was gonna sell this
one, but would take me three hours to get my bones"

and so on...

2) dr00dz in ParAdiSe (my alt - 35 druid)

(In group in OT)

Playah01: "You, dude.. need a port to Feerott."
dr00d01:  "In a group right now, we are busting up in about 5 mins holler at
me then."
Playah01:  "I need to go NOW"
dr00d01: "sorry"
Playah01: _______-string of explicatives-____________

dr00d01 adds Playah01 to no port/no rez list

...later (our dr00d01 is in Rathe Mtns trying to decide if he wants to kite
HG's or get his Cleric out for a few more levels)...

Playah01 is running around rathe mtns getting his butt handed to him by a
HG.  The HG is demonstrating new and exciting ways to dismember Playah01,
but the playah does seem to half the HG down to abt 25%.

dr00d01: "Want me to kill it or heal ya?" (Figuring if he wanted a heal we
would be halfway honorable, a kill (IMHO) means that he did not want help,
just a quickie exp pickup)
Playah01:  "Keel it!"
dr00d01 Targets a HG
dr00d01 Targets a Playah
dr00d01 Sits down
dr00d01 watches Playah01 die

dr00d01: "Killing it now.  Think next time you call someone a
___-explicative-___ think about it, some of us remember who you are."
dr00d01 adds Playah01 to Ignore List
dr00d01 Shouts:  "Dead HG with loot at loc X,Y"
dr00d01 wanders off, whistling a happy tune.
