It's odd to me how people in this game have an almost fanatical grip on
keeping strategy secret in this game.  I though the cold war ended, but it
just moved from Eastern Europe to Norrath.  Me, I play the game for fun to
unwind at the end of the day.  Sorry, I'm not near, nor will I ever be near
the RZ event, but if I knew, I'd tell you exactly how to do it.

Good luck and I hope you get past it soon.
