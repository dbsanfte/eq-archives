$22 was *CHEAP* for a new expansion. Even so, the doubled bank slots
and mapping tools alone are worth more than that, IMO. With LDoN, the
/lfg tool only adds to the value. LoY is a fantastic investment, even
if you never go to the zones it adds.

Ah, bullshit. In fact, most items I've seen drop aside from the
augment gems have been droppable. Learn what you're talking about
before making such comments, 'kay?

Tradeskilling in itself, yeah. However, I guarantee you that if you
ask your group to save you <tradeskill item a> and offer a part of
your split for it if necessary, you'll get it. And, no, LDoN
tradeskill items aren't nodrop, either. Where the fuck did you get
that idea?

Wow. Group-oriented content for a game that's supposedly
group-oriented as a whole. Don't know why so many people are surprised
by this. Especially given that they said from the first announcement
that the expansion would be group-oriented...
