Yeah it is the same pit.  I think there are ways to it without the ice
giants, but I've always killed the ice giants first.  I did notice
there were people who had camped out there popping in to see if the
rest of their team was logged on yet.  It may be worth it to just camp
there for a day or two.  I really can't remember if you can get out
without coming up through Vox's lair again.  You might want to find a
druid/wizard to join you.
