     Woah.  Time out.  Wow, does this case get thrown around a lot, and
wow,
do people have a lot of preconceived notions about it.

     First of all, it was a garden-variety tort case.  It wasn't ground-
breaking in any way.  The calling of medical experts is normal in injury
cases, burn times at varying temperatures over various parts of the body
are documented quite well, and the amounts of the rewards were also
partially
reduced due to the woman's determined level of fault -- as is normal.

     The discovery process revealed that this particular McDonald's had
had
seven hundred incidents of scalding burns due to coffee spills over the
past
ten years, including customers, employees, and infants, in some cases as
severe as the trial injury, which involved third-degree burns, skin
grafts,
and a week-long hospital stay.  Yet this restaurant continued to brew
AND
HOLD (that's important) its coffee at a temperature of 180-190 degrees
Farenheight, as opposed to the industry standard 135-150 degrees, solely
on the advice of an internal quality consultant who nevertheless
admitted
that it was undrinkable at that temperature and that anything at or over
140 can easily burn when consumed.  Burn time does not vary linearly
with
temperature, and the amount of time it takes third-degree burns to occur
drops rapidly once the substance temperature passes 150-155.

     The woman knew that coffee is hot and can burn you.  That's why she
had the driver stop the car before she tried putting cream in it.  She
isn't stupid.  The crux of the verdict is that this coffee was hot
enough
to burn her TEN TIMES FASTER than coffee served at the temperature
people
EXPECT coffee to be served at.  And she didn't know that.  And
McDonald's
did.  And they'd known it for ten years.  And they refused to either
serve
it cooler or tell anyone it was more dangerous than normal.  Mistakes
always happen, even when people take precautions.  Bad mistakes happen a
lot more when people don't take the precautions they should because they
believe, through bad faith on another's part, that they don't need to.

     The initial award was $200,000 in compensatory damages (to pay for
the
woman's hospital treatment -- McDonald's refusal to compensate the woman
at
all originally was the entire reason for the suit) and $2,700,000 in
punative damages (to penalize McDonald's for deliberately allowing a
known
hazardous condition to exist without warning anyone about it).  The
$200,000
award was immediately reduced to $160,000 due to the woman's partial
negligence.  That's right:  because she STUPIDLY opened the coffee IN
HER
LAP to put cream in it, her award was reduced.  The $2.7 million award
was
later reduced on appeal to a mere $480,000, likely because investigators
verified that McDonald's had finally reduced their coffee temperature. 
The
amount actually received by the woman is unknown because they settled
out
of court after these amounts were assigned but before they were paid.

     Now, there are a couple of ways you can go with this.  You can
insist
that this woman really was a money-grubbing whore at the outset, just
suing
to get the mega-bucks, only she got lucky and stumbled into a restaurant
that
really WAS running a shady operation.  That's fine.  I don't personally
subscribe to this notion after investigating the case, but I'm not you. 
Feel
free to continue living in your dream world where Big Businesses
ignorantly
bend a rule or two less often than an 80-year-old women deliberately
immerses
her vagina in boiling water for a second shot at winning the lottery
that
week.  After all, people are greedy and stupid, right?  Right?

     You might also have an objection to the concept of punative damages
in
general, and feel that if Entity X causes pain, suffering, injury, loss,
what
have you to Entity Y, it should never be liable for more than the amount
it
takes to treat that injury or replace that loss.  If that's the case,
there
are going to be a lot of court decisions that don't sit happy with you,
and
you'll have a very hard time defending your position to some people.  Be
forwarned.  Again, I don't agree with you, but I see how people can hold
that opinion.
