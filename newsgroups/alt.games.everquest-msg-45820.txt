Can't drown while LD,  that's one of the few good points about the current
system. You can, however, sign back on and be in the middle of some water,
not knowing where in the world you are :-)

I have no clue how it works in relation to lava though. . .

I have hunted in everfrost quite a bit with my different characters, and I
have seen *many* people die from falling off a mountain after going LD.
What's even worse is going LD and running into the ice giants or, and this
happens more frequently, Redwind's temple (at least if you fall off a
mountain mobs won't be camping your corpse)
