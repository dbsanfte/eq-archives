I suspect that if I really knew what I was doing, I'd have gotten
someone else to do it for me.

I've got a nice computer case (from 3dcool.com a year ago) with all
the sharp edges cleaned away or folded over, so at least I'm unlikely
to cut myself. I'll probably still manage a few circuit board stab
wounds, though. Those are always fun.

I am grudgingly looking forward to having a clean Windows install
again. Things get rather mucked up after a few years. I am NOT looking
forward to having to reinstall all my software though, especially my
programming stuff - that'll probably take all weekend.

Sigh.

I'll be careful, I promise.
