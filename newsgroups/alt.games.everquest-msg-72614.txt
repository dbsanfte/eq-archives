No, the base damage of a weapon is 2xdam +1, at 20th level you'll not do
much more than base damage. As you level your attack score increases
(assuming you keep the skill max'd) and so does the maximum damage (at 51st
my off hand 12 damage weapon can hit in the 40's)
If you had a 26dam weapon at 20th you'd hit in the low fifties at the most,
10 levels later and you'll be hitting in the low 80's with it.
