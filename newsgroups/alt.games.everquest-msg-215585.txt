You sir are a complete idiot.

Once again people talking about raid level equipment in a 'I am thinking
about starting a shaman' thread.

"You don't even need mana that much, except to boost your mana pool at low
levels"

That would be what the topic is. i.e. a low level starting shaman. They
won't even have canabilize until they get to level 24. I have posted this
before, I am getting sick of posting it. I have posted they can fix anything
with equipment after 24. If your little pea brain can not understand that
this is a starting character thread, then there is nothing I can do for you.

Notice even this advice is for *after* they have 160-200 int when they start
picking up hp gear.

From the same necro site

Intelligence: This statistic is of utmost importance to all pure casters.
First, this directly dictates how much mana you have. Second, this dictates
how quickly you learn nearly all skills in the game. So as a bonus of having
high intelligence, you also learn skills quicker. This is quite fair in our
opinion. Intelligence is the statistic that we recommend putting the most
points in for your necromancer. This is because of the fact that since
you're a pure caster, the more mana you have the better.
