I tried out using Terror of Shadows for aggro instead of Dooming Darkness.
As it happens, I didn't have KEI this time out, so I definitely appreciated
the lower mana cost for ToS.  If mana weren't an issue, I'd still prefer
Darkness for taking initial aggro from the puller; the extra damage helps,
and having the mob snared at first can be useful.  (And if I can hit it
with Darkness near max range, the snare means I usually have time to fire
off a pure DOT as well before it engages.)

But as I said, without KEI, ToS was much better.  Plus I did feel it was
easier to peel adds off the bard after we'd finished the first target and
it was time to break mez on the add.  ToS didn't always do it in one cast,
but it often did, and almost always worked in two casts (plus taunts, etc.).
So I think I'll keep it in my arsenal for a while and get more practice
with it.  Thanks for the pointer!
