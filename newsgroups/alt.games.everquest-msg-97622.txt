And of course, I should just "know" that?  Good Grief...I put in the topic
""no message"" SO no one would waste their time with it.  I did not know
such a newsgroup as alt.test existed and the unprovoked response is just
exactly what it wrong with "cyberspace".  I am sure the response would have
been different if he and I were in person and I did something he disagreed
with...at least I would like to think so...
