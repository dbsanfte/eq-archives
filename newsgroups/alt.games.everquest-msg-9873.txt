Oh ya, Gnome Warrior is one of my personal favorites.  Strength is a bit
low, but you start with great dex and agil so you can focus your
equipment acquisitions to boost your strength.  They play a bit
different from the big guys, you won't have the Slam attack which is
bad, but when your frenzy kicks in you still have pretty high dex and
agil.  I spent some time on mine with a cleric who kept me just under
two bubbles of hp the whole time,  constant frenzy, and oh boy does that
little Gnome kick butt!!

Bottom line is play what you enjoy, if perfect stats for a warrior are
most important go with a big guy, if you can give up some perfection in
your stats and just want to have some fun with it, go with the Gnome.
