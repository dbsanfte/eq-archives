It will stop you from raising the mana regen rate significantly though, 
as you will no longer be able to pulse the instant mana regen along with 
one of the other mana regen songs.  that is the nerf that Lance is 
talking about.  I checked on Lucy, and it does not indicate that there is 
a stacking issue, but, both songs do put the mana regen in slot 2.  Guess 
one of you bards will have to try it out and see.
