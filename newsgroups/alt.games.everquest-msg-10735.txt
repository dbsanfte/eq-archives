By this theory, I would infer that you think a ham and salad sandwich in
your group should not get cellulite if all it did was snort cocaine, and not
really cause stomache cramps to one of the fat ladies as it never actually

Nonsense gibberish? Sure - but it made as much sense to me as your post did.
I have never seen such an unrelated leap in "logic" in quite a while.
Misfiring sysnapses maybe? Flashbacks? Were you a teenager during the 60's
