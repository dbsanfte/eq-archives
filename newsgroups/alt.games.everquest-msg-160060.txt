I remember my monk getting squished once when I got insane agro because:
Double attack: 2 procs on one combat round, then the next swing I got
another proc..
was FBSS and Swift like the wind hasted

Now there may be a delay, just may not be set for all weapons... in fact I
can see it as something added in around Kunark or Velious just as a power
limiter (much like casting time on items.. originally they couldn't do that)

Not that it neccessarily reflects the online game, but here's how the pen
and paper rpg works:
Each weapon with a proc has a 'proc difficulty'... call it 23. Roll a d20,
add your dex bonus. If you get 23 or higher, you get a proc. no time
restrictions in there.
