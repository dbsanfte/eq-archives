Anonymous.  Unknown server, uknown guild, unknown players, in a fairly 
*obscure* forum.  There is no harm here.  I have not and would not do 
this on the guild board, any server board.  The player in involved has not 
spoken to the leadership since leaving, the leadership hasn't spoken to 
her.  No one has said a word about her in these reguards even in 
leadership forums.

The *worst* thing that's been said on the board is, after the log of her 
pitched fit and subsequent deguilding, was that the kind of attitude she 
displayed was not one that the guild needed.  And that wasn't an officer.

And it's not a dealing with a member... it's a former member who left in a 
shitstorm, if you'll pardom the term.  The emotional and verbal abuse that 
she and her husband have subjected people to over a couple of items, 
when they've been well taken care of, have made this a real extraordinary 
case.
