Well said :) I wouldn't want a single player to be able to stack DoTs of a 
similar line, but I agree in that two players shouldn't be restricted in such a 
way. Druids, for example, can already stack various DoTs anyway, such as Drones 
of Doom and Immolate. Combinations of DoTs can take an enemy down rather quick.
