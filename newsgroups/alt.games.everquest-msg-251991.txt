Agree with this one.  If you want an easy place to get to that's safe,
come out the DSP tunnel and go right and park up on the hill, then
pull gorangas over to that area.  MUCH safer and no adds.  

The hill over just past AR zone is good too if you can get there
without running afoul of any see invis mobs - hug the zone wall most
of the way there, the kinda swing wide past the mobs guarding the AR
entrance.
