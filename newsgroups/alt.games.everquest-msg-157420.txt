<snip>

I remember when I was a young halfling druid, sitting in misty thicket and
quite happy with my progress, having obtained a huge sum of money by selling
the 23 misty acorns I had meticulously collected over my time there: 2pp
each from an aspiring vendor, 56pp, a huge sum for a druid who had to fish
(and hope for the rusty dagger and sandal) to obtain the cash to buy spells
previously.

I bragged to people at lvl 14 I would travel to "Freeport" a new and
exciting town to the east.  They cautioned me not to go at night, and I
thanked them for their advice.  Finally, the big day I'd planned came and I
broke out my maps obtained from EQAtlas and began my run, meticulously
following the path.  I arrived in Freeport without incident, and bound
myself there.  Being the adventurous sort, I'd thought i'd try to kill some
of the mobs and soon found myself sitting in the EC tunnel recovering from
the nastiest poison i'd ever experienced.  While I was sitting there, somone
inspected my meager equipment.  (I was wearing my fished sandal, proudly no
less.)  He took pity on me and gave me 2 Runed Mithril Bracers.  Well, you
can bet those were my prized possession suddenly, and I wore them with pride
until quite recently.  I obtained the magic "Velium mace" that day, from
someone giving items away to newbies at the gate.  It replaced my newbie
club and was a giant 2 damage more.  It did help me kill willowisps tho =).

Another "Thank you" to those kind people, should they be reading this.

That day I found my first guild, which I stayed in and made friends, became
an officer, and stayed with it until it disbanded nearly a RL year later.

But life, and EQ, goes on, and I remember my newbie days fondly.  I still
travel to Rivervale to buy misty acorns from the newbies, and give out those
junk weapons that are such a godsend to them.
