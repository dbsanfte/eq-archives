I can understand that, my views of humans are quite pessimistic, as in the
whole planet would be much better off without such a cancerous organism.
Right or wrong that view definately isn't one design to ingratiate myself
with my fellows...

But really, we are animals. Have you seen animals getting pissed? Exactly
like humans. Have you seen dogs barking at each other through a fence?
Humans still haven't dragged themselves out of the territorial pissing stage
either. Seen a bird collect shiney objects for it's nest to attract a mate?
The list goes on. Monkeys on the other hand are a lot less offensive than
humans if you look closer, they just rape and eat each other on occasion.
Not bad habits at all... compared to humans that is.

Being omnivorous on the other hand is a survival trait, not a mandate. It's
all well and good to be vegetarian, but it is a luxurious choice not often
afforded to humans throughout history. In my six years military stint, I was
silly enough to sign up for a survival course (very silly for a technician,
even in a operational unit). You really see where being omnivorous is an
advantage on 10 days of forced marching without food. Insects, grass,
snakes, it didn't matter. If it was edible and catchable without stopping
then it qualified (by the way, it all tasted like shit apart from some of
the grasses and you can't eat too much of that).

Humans are exceedingly predatory on each other. Our priveliged western
culture is funded by cheap labour and resources in other countries. The
bright future you see may eventuate... for the privilged few. Everyone else
will still be eating shit to support them.

If you abolish death in humans, then you would need to abolish (new) life in
humans. Our gene pool would stagnate. It would only be a matter of time
before we would be evolutionarily outclassed. You have microbes with
generations measured in hours which are <already> kicking our asses. I think
you have to view "eternal" life from a point of view of our genetic
information, and not as ourselves as individuals.

I have a feeling I am quoting someone here, but I don't know who: "Death is
not the handicap it is made out to be".

> /sigh

Welcome to the club. I /sigh so many times a day it isn't funny anymore. I
see a car dealership brimming with new cars and think "what a stupendously
criminal waste of enviromental resources". I see a person strut by in
designer labels and dripping with gold jewllery and think "Chirp Chirp.
Polly wanna cracka?".  I go to board the bus and some aggressive teenage boy
tries to stare me down and push past me... "Woof Woof... Grrrr". It's like
being stuck in a bloody zoo in a cage full of ass picking gorillas.

The worst thing is I see the same traits and desires in myself. I can't
bring myself to play the "human game" because it is so <stupid>, yet I know
that is the one thing that will actually make me a happier person. I am
going against my own competetive "programming" and that is what causes the
mental illness I suffer from.
