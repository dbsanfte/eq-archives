It's been around in varying forms since at least 1983, which is when I
first encountered it in the BBS world. I suspect it started with
shorthand typing on live chat systems, where "u" was less typing than
"you", which apparently appealed to lazy people and bad typists.

Somewhere along the line some unhappy saps decided that making
themselves difficult to understand was cool, or at least it helped
disguise the fact that they had nothing of consequence to say, so they
expanded on it, resulting in the unfortunate style we see today.
