It can also be very funny.  A while back, someone posted that they were
hunting in OT with two rogues, both of which were using that illusion.
Each rogue also had something that had one charge of a gate spell.

Things were going fine, until each rogue got a little confused about who
was where...then saw each other, and both said "/g goon!" and gated.
