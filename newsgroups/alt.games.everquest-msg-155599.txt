Read the above quote again. That's almost exactly what he said. There
was nothing that implied consideration of a silver lining.

I completely agree with this. Adults should not be so protected from
themselves, and I do find an adult or even older children suffering
from their own stupidity as a productive thing.  Of course, signs
don't really apply to children for whom the "See and Say" type toys
mentioned in the example would be age-appropriate.

I just hope you're never the parent of that one "dolt". I find it
curious that a three-year-old could be considered a dolt. I'm guessing
Einstein was just getting over pooping in his trousers, still poked
everything he picked up into his mouth and would have been completely
at risk of strangling himself at that age.

Again, signs don't do much for such young children.

I don't know, isn't plastic cheaper than using wood or tin? Blame
capitalism and the tree-huggers. I don't go out of my way to avoid
wood or metal in toys for my kids. I will try to avoid those that have
contributed to the death of a child too young to know any better. Keep
in mind we're not talking about a 10-year-old blowing his hand off
with an M-80 here. It's a toddler with absolutely no knowledge of any
reason NOT to strangle themselves with the string. Intelligence does
not enter into it.

More power to you. Lincoln Logs, for one, are still one of my favorite
toys. Also, if you're going to design a monster dump-truck, metal is
the only way to go. I agree with you for the most part about many
toys' entertainment value suffering from such redesign.

Well, if it kills them, that pretty much eliminates any possible
educational value. Besides, if your child had trouble figuring out how
to pull-start your lawnmower because he never had a See and Say that
implemented a pullstring, they have other bigger problems. There are
plenty of opportunities along the way to learn consequence before
driving age. They don't have to get it all down while they are still
learning things like basic motor skills.

There's a big difference between risk of injury and risk of death. I
agree that trying to remove the risk of injury from all toys is pretty
silly. Let's just try to make sure no one dies because they misused
the toy in a manner they had no possibility of knowing was a bad idea.
