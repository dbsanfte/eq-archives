As far as I can tell, you are not supposed to be able to wake him up yet. He
has a big script that runs, for something epic.  When they did wake him up
(probably a bug), all the worlds dragons were part of the script.  Naggy,
vox and all the rest started shouting to the zone about him being awake...
so its pretty big, but its broken/incomplete.  The sleeper looks like a big
human model... so hes not done yet.

BUT, this wasnt the correct reason, since CQ did NOT kill the sleeper, nor
did they kill the 4th warder.

here some screenies :

They were banned for some kind of exploit, which it seems nobody knows
about... not even the GM who banned/suspended them.  Probably something to
do with using the Rez as a agroless heal, and its slow side effect (5%) not
stacking with the slow spell the warder uses (70% slow).
