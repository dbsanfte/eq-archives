I found a bug!

I bought and sold and made a few plat, I went to the bank. After
returning, I truied to sell again. I got a yellow message saying you
have to be in a trader position. I was just outside the tarps where
you sell.

After moving under the tarps where others are trading I got another
message saying you have to move where the merchants are. Nothing I did
cleared the red message, and when I moved away from the traders and
hit begin trade I got the yellow one. I deleted my ini file and got
the same result. A different character trades okay. The one with the
red messages persists in the bug.

I am patching mty second machine to see if it works properly. 

Anyone else see this or cleared it?
