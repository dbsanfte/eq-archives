Monk tank, aka myself, suits my style of gaming.   It is acceptable to my
friends and I.
Its preferable to my grouping because of the high DPS/low healing nature of
my groups, the nature of botted chars etc.

Tank better than a knight is subjective....  there aren't many hybrids on
the server better geared than me (if you want to talk raw HP/AC), or with
more defensive skills (if you wanna talk AA #'s)..  there is also a knight
(pali to be specific) who is around 9khp and can outtank most warrs...  so
what would be the purpose of making such claims?  I think you misread, or
more likely misunderstood my original posts.  Seeing more of your posts each
day though, this doesn't really surprise me.

And again I will state, level 1 duos is NOT PoP grouping.  Did it sink in
yet?
Level 1 duos is NOT Pop grouping!   Hello???  Anything in there?!?!

At the low levels individual class means next to nothing, Im sure my level 1
wizard tanks close enough to my level 1 monk for the difference to not be
noticed.
