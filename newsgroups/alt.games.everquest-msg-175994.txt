That's from someone that ebayed plat.  I've often thought of putting some
items like that on a char for 10k ea (say, grubs, rations, pods of water,
etc.) and seeing if the plat seller buys them from me instead of the correct
intended.  I can just imagine the tells after...  Even if they petition,
what could they say?  "Um, Mr GM, I bought the wrong grb for 10K.  I want my
money back so I can give it to the right toon..."
