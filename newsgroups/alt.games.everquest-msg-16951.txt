Why do people invite you to join a group before asking?  I was invited 3
times in a matter of miutes by different people without once being asked.
Once was by a 2st level, once by a 6th and once by an 11th.  I have 7 Dwarf
Cleric.  What's up with this?

The last one was a real winner.  I'm sitting down licking wounds when I get
the You've been invited message.  Events in order...
Invite...
Hail...
Hail Kadson...
me "Hello"...
"Want join us"
me "What's the plan?"
"Joi us"

Give me a break!
