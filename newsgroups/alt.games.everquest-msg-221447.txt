It's the Healing Waters spell.  The two pieces are "A Golden Emblem", and
look identical.  Get a Silvery Mask (about 150pp) so you can cast Identify
on them.  Storage Worker drops the Emblem of Tunare and Treasure Sorter
drops Emblem of Karana.  We quested these for druids in my guild every night
for a week with no drop, then got two sets for the spell in one evening.

I was pulling from the two warehouses by boat 3 (on eqatlas).  I would solo
(at 54), and had a few groups with guildies to get this spell.  The MObs
have a small aggro range, and can easily be single pulled without aggro.
Trick is, use snare to pull and they will single.  If you pull with a damage
component, they will all add.  There is a safe spot right between the ramp
to the dock and the warehouse.  Pull to that spot and should have no
problems.

In the week that we were there, got about 5 pairs of Repugnant Leather
Boots, 3 pretty nice Earrings that were selling in bazaar for about 1kpp
each, 5 Fire Emeralds, 6 Diamonds, 4 Blue Diamonds, no-stat emerald rings
sold to vendor for 75pp, and a ton of normal vendor trash.  XP was good, and
one guildie went from 44-46 there.

Hope that helps a bit, if you have any questions about questing that spell,
send me a mail and I'll tell you what I can to help.
