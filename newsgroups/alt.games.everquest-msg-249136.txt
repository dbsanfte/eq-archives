The one outrageous act does not in the least way or at all demonstrate
"their disregard for human life" if by "their" you are implying Iraqis in
general.  The only guilt that video shows is the 5 participants and in no
way justifies our being there.  To imply that the Iraqis people are tainted
by the beheading is to imply that you are guilty of the tortures in Abu
Ghraib.  Does this then justify an invasion of the US?  Of course not.  To
call it a justification for the invasion of Iraq is obviously hypocritical.
Be honest.
