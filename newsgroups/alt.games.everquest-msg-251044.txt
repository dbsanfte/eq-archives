Criminal Law then.

But even business law is largely in support of justice and fair play... 
even if that's never how it actually works out =)

Seeing that the principles of utility, justice, and rights all would 
conclude that needlessly endagering someone else is wrong, I'm not sure 
what more you could ask for in terms of moral grounding.

Just what are the ramifications of a perfect drug?

"... the old men have no time, no leisure from pleasure, not a moment to 
sit down and thinkï¿½or if ever by some unlucky chance such a crevice of 
time should yawn in the solid substance of their distractions, there is 
always soma, delicious soma, half a gramme for a half-holiday, a gramme 
for a week-end, two grammes for a trip to the gorgeous East, three for a 
dark eternity on the moon; returning whence they find themselves on the 
other side of the crevice, safe on the solid ground of daily labour and 
distraction,..."

Soma, the perfect drug. Feelings and emotions and time to think are 
dangerous destabilizing things ...let us never have to bear having any 
of these things. Let's just all sit back, watch Friends, and take a 
half-gramme of soma... life is better like this. We're happy now.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying getting stoned is wrong, per se. But 
nontheless Brave New World explores the idea that drug induced serenity 
and happiness can lead to a dystopia from which there is no escape, 
because there is no desire to escape. You are in a cage, but with drugs, 
conditioning, and distractions you just don't care. Its disturbing. =)
