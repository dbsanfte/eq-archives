Heh, I might become something like that :)

I have a lvl 23 war now who is a bit twinked with a Babs and full BA armor.
When I was lvl 20 with finally my dam cap released I was overjoyd. The group
consisted of a cleric, paladin, mage, wizard and a druid. A 47 cleric
guildie buffed me to the heavens so I wouldn't die often, but the rest
didn't know that.

I was chain pulling white and yellow Kobolds in SB. At one point I was down
to 1 red bub, the whole group oom, including the pallie and pulled 2 blues
and 2 yellows. The whole group screamed murder and rape while the pet and me
were fighting happily. The pallie joined soon after after useing the
remainder of her mana to heal me.
The wiz gated, the druid started to kite 1 yellow and 1 blue and the cleric
was litterally praying for mana.

We all survived (except the wimpy wiz who died getting back through the
Warrens :-/ )and after that nobody cared if I overpulled.
The only narrow squeek after that was when our mage overnuked and got 3
pounding on him. By some sheer strike of luck the palli, druid and me all
targetted a different one and we got them all taunted off before the mage
died. Still don't know why the mobs didn't put in the few killing blows as
they often do when someone is very very low on health.


Stopping my ramblings now :)
