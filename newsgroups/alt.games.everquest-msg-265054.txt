I've got it downloading on my main puter now. (1500 files left at 128k.. 
but hell I dl'd the WoW stress test.) I don't expect it to really 
distract me long term, but what little I've seen looks cute.

For those that are interested, btw, I have it on good authority that the 
final big stress test for WoW is about to begin.  How you get in? I dunno.
