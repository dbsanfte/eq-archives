From the shadows, the mysterious Brian Trosko <btrosko@panix.com> (if

What's the status on that now? Is bnetd still pushing forward despite
the threats?

I don't recall it saying anywhere on my box of D2 that you had to use
battle.net and that other forms of finding players was wrong, so
Blizzard can shove their lawsuit up their ass.

When Bungie took Bungienet for Myth down, they actually showed some
long time players how to make a private one so those hardcore Myth
players still had a place to go.
