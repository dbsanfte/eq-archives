Hmmn - what sig do you reckon suits me best?:

"Notice: signs of rampant insanity left in for the amusement of those who
believe themselves balanced."

-or-

"Notice: signs of wretched patheticness left in for the benefit of those who
like to feel superior."

-or even-

"Notice: factual errors left in for the benefit of people who like to
superior based upon the mere fact of being right."
