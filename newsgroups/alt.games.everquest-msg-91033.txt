I typically don't feed the trolls, but what the hell-
Legends was delayed today for the same reason the other servers got shot to
hell- patch day.  It would have launched ontime except it was affected by a
bug in today's patch just like the other servers were.  Rather than
launching Legends at 2 pm ET and then shutting it down to patch, they opted
to wait until they had the patch written and could broadcast it to all
servers. 2 GMs have been in the Legends chat for hours answering questions,
and several more were dropping in.  Actually, good customer support so far.
Don't release something you KNOW is broken...
