So my question is, why hasn't inflation increased the desirability of 
potions?

Honestly, for me it has done just that, I think nothing of swigging SOW 
potions continuously, nor handing them out to group members who need SOW 
to pull with or friends running to get to a camp site; a few years ago I 
carried one around but rarely used it, 10pp or so per sip was too much cash.

I carry around a 10 shot gate potion which I'd never have been able to 
afford a few years ago; I think twice about using it still, but as an 
insurance policy it seems well worth having.

I carry around a 10 shot DS potion, again, I think twice about using it 
but it was worth buying for difficult targets; I don't use it because 
I'm normally not doing the "kill your way thru trash to reach difficult 
mob X" thing lately.

How much more would the average cash value in people's pockets have to 
increase before more shaman potions would be worth spending the money on?
