Says who? Sure it would have been great to have the teleportation
system years ago, but that doesn't mean that it "should have been
intergrated" back then. Things that Sony said they would never put
into the game are showing up as EQ has evolved over the past 3+ years.
Partly to attract new players and partly to retain old ones that are
starting to burn out. It's not a conspiracy, and it's not an evil
trick to make money. EQ is a business and like any business it will
attempt to evolve to meet the needs of the market.

It is smart business to put features into a product that make it
attractive to buyers. No one is forced to buy the expansion. If the
new transportation system is worth the price of the expansion to
players that will never use the high-level content in PoP, then they
will choose to buy it. If not, they will take a pass. No one is being
screwed.
