Ok, so I was really excited to finally get to 49 with my shammy and get
harnessing of spirit, when I learn that it doesn't stack with normal STR and
DEX buffs, Tuna, or even Rage.

So I guess the only advantage to this spell is slightly less mana and less
casting time to get the equivalent of Tuna, STR, and DEX on your tanks?

Is that it?  Hope I'm missing something really special here.
