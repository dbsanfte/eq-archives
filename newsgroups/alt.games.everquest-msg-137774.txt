Well, if the victim of the scam had had no claim whatsoever to the goods 
they have been deprived of, they can't reasonably argue their quality of 
play has suffered, any more than the player that has scammed them can 
argue that *their* quality of play will suffer if they have to return 
the scammed gear to the victim.

In shourt, you cannot be scammed out of what's not yours.

As for the other argument, I've drop-twinked dozens of times with no 
damage to my quality of play, so the claim that dropping an item on the 
ground damages your quality of play is self-evidently bogus.
