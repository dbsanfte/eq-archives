That's a tough one. Most of the expansions have content aimed at the
higher level crowd.

You just named off the most populart Mid-20s zones in the expansions.

OId world is still your best bet. In general Mobs have fewer hit
points and hit for less damage than the ones in the expansions.

26 - Fear Song (fear kiting)
27 - Charm Song (charm/swarm kiting)

You are about to enter the "Golden Age" of Bard-dom :-) Your best bet
is to go to the popular mid-20s zones and get in a group till you ding
26. At that point you can fear kite to 27 then play with charm.

Some suggestions...
SolA (with a group)
South Karana (Aviaks, Gnolls, etc)
Upper Guk (with a group)
HighKeep (in a group)
Netharbian Lair (with a group)
