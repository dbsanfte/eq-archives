Yes, I know. Had ME installed originally and kept getting blue screens
with a game a few years back...but in fairness, I know that particular
game came out with several patches for that very reason, so I can't
blame it all on the OS...but at the time, I didn't want to fool around
with reliability so I put on Win2k.  Well, as good as I think Win2k
may be, I have found no version of windows that does not start having
problems after a few years due to registry speghetti, replaced dll's
etc...so anyways I'm having some problems with my OS now that I am
tired of having to work around, so it's time for some house cleaning.
That said, I have heard from several people in this group that the
graphics, sound, and especially music, which is horrible with win2k,
is much better with ME due to the lack of OS overhead. So I though I
would install ME,  fire up EQ, and check it out. It I find that the
over all gaming performance is better, then I'll stick with it and
install the rest of my apps.   If there is no noticeable diff, all
I've lost is the OS install time, I'll reformat and put win2k back.
We'll see.
