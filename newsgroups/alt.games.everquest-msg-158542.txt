Actually, most fights beyond Kunark level last a comparatively long amount
of time.   DoT's will probably run thier course and then some.   The reason
for the twitching is...  well, even if you throw every DoT there is at a
mob, they're won't make a bit of difference if the clerics do not have
enough mana to keep the main tank alive while they run...

Heh... but he only starts when it's down to 20 percent or so, and the
casters are all nuking hard ; )   Before the mod rod / mob hit point nerf,
most Luclin boss mob fights lasted over a half hour.    Some that I did were
as long as 50 minutes of constant combat.

Even after the nerf, our fight with Idol of Rallos Zek last night...
probably took a good 15 or 20 minutes start to finish.

There are very few more disruptive thing that a necro can do at a raid.  If
they're skeleton form nuking, they're no longer helping, they're hurting the
raid.  This is for several reasons.

1)  Almost all boss mobs are extremely large.  Theres a good reason for
this...  it means that 30 melee fighters can fit very comfortably around it,
without crowding anyone, and all in combat range.  The second that skeleton
form nuke hits, it turns into a tiny little skeleton that only 10 melee can
hit, if they crowd each other.   Congrats, you just did 520 damage to the
mob, and cost the raid about 2000 damage because two thirds of the melee
were out of the new combat range.  Glad we brought you along....

2) It is extremely disorienting to the main tank to have a mob change form
with no warning.  Every time it happens to me, I immediately react and spin
about trying to find where the mob went to... which caster overaggroed and
pulled it off of me.  By the time I realize it turned into a skeleton,
locate the skeleton and find it, theres a good chance that he is no longer
on me.  If we're lucky it's just on some other (probably soon to be dead)
melee in front of me... if we're not, then that little skeleton is generally
quading 1100 per hit on a cleric or two....
