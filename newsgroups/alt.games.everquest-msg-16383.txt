Well apart from sense animals, all may aggro the animal somehow, a
feared or charmed animal will come back wanting a piece of me as soon as
fear or charm breaks.

What exactly do you suppose fear should be used for apart from fear
kiting etc? Just sending the things away? What about when they come
back?

And if I send some hapless animal to its death at the hands of another
mob because I charmed it to protect me, aren't I just as guilty of
getting it killed as if I'd just nuked it into oblivion?
