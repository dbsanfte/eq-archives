Turgur line lasts 6+ minutes.
Shiftless line lasts about 2 mins.
Forlorn deeds is a rare mob dropped.  Turgur (higher percentage of
slow aquired EARLIER) is vendor bought.

Take a guess as to why a shaman is probably the better choice.

I doubt there's a 52+ shaman without Turgur.
I SERIOUSLY doubt that all enchanter of appropriate level has Forlorn
Deeds.

Yep, didn't say it wasn't unresisted.  I said it wasn't as resisted as
you would be lead to believe.

No kidding.
Maybe because shrooms have abnormally high magic resistence?  Besides,
usually at a level 60 shaman will be tossing Malo, Malosni and then
Turgur.  In that sequence, it's EXTREMELY rare for a non-100% MR mob
to resist slows more than once.  Hell in that combinations you can
freaking slow a Sleeper's Tomb warder with a couple of shots and if
the tank is doing their job, the mob will simply ignore the shaman for
the most part (I got summoned last time when I sat after getting
Turgur to stick...fixed the sit aggro my ass).

Wrong.
When imps are swinging once every 6 seconds, you can trivially get
heals off between swings.

Try it, you would be amazed at what you can accomplish with slow on a
mob. 

Psst:  Name the one class in the game who managed to solo a western
wastes dragon?  Yep, that crazy as fuck Nixx the shaman soloed Yeldema
(admittedly probably the only soloable dragon there) with just a
combination of Turgur and his epic (he needed that for the damage
output since shamans kinda suck at damage generation).

Assist off enchanter cast turgur.
Resisted, who do you think the mob is going after?  The enchanter or
the shaman?  Hint:  Which generates more aggro mez or turgur (ask a
shaman).

Enchanter has a second chance to mez.  This sort of ping ponging aggro
is exactly what you can do even with resists.  Meanwhile the tank
handles the second mob.

BTW, if an enchanter can't handle two mob pulls, he should be dropped
from the group.  Infact, back when I bothered playing an enchanter, 4
to 5 mobs were the normal pulls anything less was just dull.  Verix
spawn in Karnor sewers at level 54 is a lot of fun by the way.
Especially when the spawns around that room gets messed up and you
start pulling 7 at a time.  :-)
