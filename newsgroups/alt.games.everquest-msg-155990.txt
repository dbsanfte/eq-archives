Has done nothing to allay the whining and gnashing of teeth which has
already begun, though.

/sigh

Read a discussion by a sorcerer from one of the Marr servers, I believe,
where they are going to go try it with nothing but massive chain
sunstrikes by five sorcerers and a cleric. Odds are they will still win.
But odds are also that the traditional MB whiners will still be whining.
Fact is, it's not about manaburn at all. Five sorcerers can blow up some
awfully big things.

And one more note to boot. We got to observe, first hand recently, one
of the tougher guilds on our server who had a cleric bot ready for a
click stick and had the final components ready. They took down rage with
that bot and six level sixties in a standard engagement battle. No
deaths, and the group included a druid who ported them in.

You going to see any whining about that? About six level sixties that
just killed a dragon and could port in on a moment's notice?

No.

Why?

They're not wizards. No big kaboom. This equals no rampant jealousy. And
thus, no whining.
