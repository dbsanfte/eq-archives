MQ is short for multiquest.  It takes advantage of the fact that, whenever a
quest receives a turn in, he or she does not care who makes that turn in
until the last item required to complete the quest.  As far as the quest
giver is concerned, the person who turns in the last item may as well have
turned in all required items, and is awarded accordingly.  It's used in
quests that have NO DROP components.

An example may help.  When you do the quest for an EB item in the Grey, you
need to turn in 3 shissar organs.  But they are no drop, so you cannot go
hunt the shissar and then just give them to a friend for turn in.  The MQ
part, then, is to have the recipient make sure and loot 1 organ.  Then the
person doing the hunting loots 2 more.  When it's time to do the turn in,
the one with 2 organs turns his or hers in first.  The quest giver will
complain that he wanted 3 organs for his research.  Then the person with 1
organ turns his or hers in, and the quest giver celebrates getting the third
organ and the person who did the last turn in gets the prize.

SOE has worked to prevent MQs at times by adding in steps like no fail
combines of all ingredients just before turn in.  Because there is only one
item to turn in, it cannot be MQ'd.

Hope this helps.
