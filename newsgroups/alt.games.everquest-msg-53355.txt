 I was at the event in Oasis with 3 named Sg's on the Morell Thule server. The
3 SG's were just standing around saying thing like "I squshed another" "opps"
(not a direct quote). I wasnt to sure of what was going on i conned them
indifferent..so i walking up and asked what they needed...one says "A big
drink" So i give him some water and i get hot for 129 damage now being lvl 19
at the time..this wasnt too fun. After getting out of there the zone was
flooded with lvl 50's and the killin began....again i saw one alone standing on
the hill..tried to see if he wanted to (play)...he says something about folling
him...i ask for a piggyback ride...i get hit for 126 damage...so i stand back
and watch the player hck and slash him to death...some event
