I have been crashing to desktop too.  It doesn't matter if I'm zoning,
selling or fighting.  It always happens.  eq.game.exe crashes, and I get the
dreaded 1018 error and can't log in for 5 min +.  A real pain in the ass.
They better get this fixed soon.

It's been happening alot, not just with me.  When I am in a group, it's a
very rare event that four ppl don't go LD, with the same complaints that I
have listed above.

Sigh.  Guess we have to live (or die) with these errors.
