Hi,

This is prolly gonna be a long post, so either skip it or please bear
with me.

I play a 35th Warrior...and I'm damned good at it. And I still
occassionally break Mezzes. Sorry, it just happens.

Let's back up a little...

I have played almost exclusively pickup groups...from EC to Oasis to
Highpass to Highkeep to OT.

Up through my early and even late 20s, there just weren't that many
Enchanters around. So, who did crowd control? Me. That's right, the
Warrior. (I actually prefer to call it "Aggro Management".) There were
almost always other tanks, but 99% of them seemed clueless about crowd
control (and still do seem clueless). When I see one of the adds break
off and attack a caster, Cleric, or Ranger (they're so delicate), it's
me who taunts 'em off. I find it surprising that at 35, I still have
to tell casters that when you get aggro, don't run around like a
chiken with your head cut off. Stay put while I get a couple of swings
off, then move a few steps away. Repeat, if necessary. And for God's
sake never, EVER swing your weapon (the Rangers never listen to this
one). In fact, unless your weapon has some kind of stat bonus or
something, put the damned thing away. I try to stand where I can see
all of the casters, mobs or both if possible. I tell the casters to
give a hollar IMMEDIATELY when they get aggro, just in case I don't
see it. I tell them that I can definitely get two mobs off you...three
on a good day. More than that, RUN. If you get down to two bubs of
health, RUN.

Anyways, when I see my Cleric getting pounded, it's really really hard
for me not to do anything about it. And it seems that Enchanters -
even the good ones - are the last people to ask for help. Don't get me
wrong: A good Enchanter is worth her weight in platinum. But if my
Cleric takes more than 5 seconds of pounding, mezz or no, I'm on it. I
love you guys, but I love my Cleric more. My snuggly, cuddly little
Cleric - Oh yeah. Anyways, if my Cleric dies before I do, it's my
fault, but I'll take my guilt out on the Enchanter.

As a Warrior, I'll be the first to admit that most tanks - Warriors
included - are idiots. When I MA in OT (which I usually do), and
there's an Enchanter in the group, I'll try to pull two or three mobs
at a time. I try to arrange it so that the first mob to our camp is
the mob I have targetted, but it doesn't always work out that way.
When it doesn't, all the other melees attack the first mob over the
hill - no matter how many times I beg them to /assist me. That's an
instant broken mezz...usually two (the first mezz breaks, then the
Enchanter targets the mob I'm on and I break that mezz) and that makes
one very pissed off Enchanter. When I'm not MA, the ONLY way I target
mobs is with /assist (Exception: When my huggable, lovable Cleric has
aggro for too long - then I click on the mob). Mezz's still get
broken. The MA will often switch mobs for no appearent reason (again,
this is one of those idiot tanks). Don't ask me why...I NEVER switch
targets after the Incoming message.

Oh yeah...a note for the melee's reading this. I don't need to see
"Assisting the Mighty Human, Aleheart" messages - at 35, I don't want
to see them anymore. I know when you are and aren't /assisting me. If
you're not, you'll hear from me. I know who broke the mezz and when.
You'll hear from me. I know if it was an honest mistake or your own
stupidity. You'll hear from me. If you don't know how to make an
/assist button, I will happily and patiently walk you through it. You
get three chances to piss off my Enchanter, then you're outta here.
