I don't know if this was in the last 5 months, but there were some changes
to Monk damage mitigation to partially reverse the nerf. It's not back up to
previous standards, but it's better than it was. Monkly-business for details

LoY is good experience, good loot, and a fair number of people are around
there. Check it out, you'll probably like it. Look into Dulak or the
entrance to Nadox at your level
