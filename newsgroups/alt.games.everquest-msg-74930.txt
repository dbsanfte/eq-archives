When I group (which is seldom to never now that I have gotten a nice
little wrist item)  it is almost always pick-up (more than 2 people
defining group for me).  I am also a little particular, especially now
at 47, to avoid being the main healer in a group...  Have yet to
complete the quest for Cann II, mostly because my guildmates, until
recently, weren't capable of providing the back-up to do it.... and it
seems kind of pointless anymore.  Not sure it is worth the effort.
Cann3 isn't too far off.

Group wise, I keep up Enstill, E-Breath, Scourge, Blizzard Blast,
GHeal, Chloro, Spirit of Bi Lhi (replacing SoW) and either Tugors or
Haste.  Depends on situation.

Solo, keep Enstill, E-Breath, Scourge, GHeal, Chloro, Glamour (yes, a
pointless buff, but seems to make root stick better... could be
imagination) SoW, Gate, and latest Malo for those resistant mobs... no
DD spell at all.  Looking forward to 49 and E-Bolt... 

Of course, everything is based on situation... on a Vox or Naggy raid,
nothing but heals and buffs early, and every debuff/slow/dot that can
be thrown later.
