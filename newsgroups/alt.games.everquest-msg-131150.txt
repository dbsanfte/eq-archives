Of course, there is this thing called "coincidence". I know people who
have played the game for years and have never seen nor interacted with
a GM. That doesn't mean they don't exist.

The uninvited tell to a total stranger making demands on their time.
Call it a "request" all you want, but when you choose to dump it on
them directly, no matter how it's worded, it becomes a demand.

Another bullshit dodge.

It's called "snipping text I'm not replying to". Common Usenet
courtesy.

Gee, and here you go on about "strawmen".

For "strawmen", you seem unable to break them down. Interesting.

Such as? No, didn't think so. You, on the other hand, are a fucking
hypocrite if you're trying to bash me on this point.

Let's see, you're advocating sending port/buff requests via tells to
total strangers rather than /ooc. Most of the group who have responded
on this point say they feel it's rude. I'm sorry, I don't see where my
implication is off-base in the slightest. Next.

See above.

Mmhmm. And yet, it has you resorting to trying to play
holier-than-thou and throwing patronizing bullshit smokescreens rather
than coming up with solid responses to my arguments. Nice try. You
lose.
