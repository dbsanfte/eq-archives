I just did a search of patch messages at http://eq.castersrealm.com for both
"tishan" and "tashan" and found no comments about aggro being lessened.

Just be aware...the higher you reach the more tash will aggro.  Unless a
cleric is already starting to cast healing on you before you have lost even
one hit point, at level 51 if you cast tash in the first 10 seconds of a
fight in many Velious dungeons you will die.  The same is true for the epic
weapon encounters that require multiple groups.

Tash has always had a higher aggro than snare...neither of which are very
safe to cast at the beginning of a fight.
