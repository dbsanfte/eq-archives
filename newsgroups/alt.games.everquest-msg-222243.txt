I've felt the same way all my life. "Morality" driven by fear of 
supernatural punishment or lust for supernatural reward isn't morality 
at all, just conditioning. And of course, religion-driven morality only 
works as long as it happens to move vaguely along the lines of consensus 
morality... The day the religious leader du jour decides that it's okey 
to burn witches at the stake, or shoot abortion doctors, or bomb those 
who follow a different deity, morality flies right out of the window.

Religion evolved because it added a further layer of peer-pressure to 
the in-built, genetic concept of morality (understood as that which 
furthers the good of the many) that being a social species necessarily 
gives us, and therefore gave a small, yet significant, darwinian 
advantage. Unfortunately, like many other things, as civilization 
becomes more sophisticated, many things that were marginally useful 
while we were fighting mammoth become hindrances in the 21st century, 
much as the immune system does for organ transplant rejection or our fat-
storage mechanisms for morbid obesity.
