Okay I've got something to whine about. Shadow Knights at level 30 can 
lifetap for 45HP. This has been the same value since Paladins had 90HP 
heals at the same level. This gives the impression that Shadow Knight 
lifetaps are half that of the equivalent Paladin heal.

Now, since Paladins and other non-Cleric classes had their 10% healing 
penalty removed, Paladins can heal for 100HP. However this didn't affect 
Shadow Knights.

Therefore...

*I should be able to lifetap for 50HP!!!*
