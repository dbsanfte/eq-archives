I played a craftsman and made it to novice Weaponsmith with all but
hand-to-hand combat mastered, on the way to becoming a Commando. 
During that entire time, I never felt the need to group with anyone. 
I never *met* anyone.  I never joined a guild.  Sure, there is an
advantage to joining a community/guild/whatever, but by the time it
would have really helped me?  I was bored of it and didn't miss it.

In my opinion:

-Too easy to become a master in anything.  I played casually for a
month and just found it too easy to level up.

-Crappy guilding.  In the month I played, I saw a whole *lot* of
unguilded people and a handful of people that had formed communities
or guilds or whatever they were called.  Friends bring you back to the
game.  I didn't feel the need to group much, which is how you meet
people and join guilds.  I didn't go on many "raids".  No chance to
meet people...

-There may have been uber loot to get in high level places.  So uh,
where was it?  In EQ I see other people's gear.  I hear how many HP
they have.  I hear how high level they are and how many AA's they are
and find out about the amazing things they can do with their
characters.  It made me want to level up and be uber.  In SWG, I
bought a nice pistol for a few thousand plat and as far as I could
tell, it was one of the best weapons around.  Were their better?  I'm
sure there were.  I never saw 'em.  Seems to me the only thing anyone
wanted to do that looked like any fun was earn enough faction points
to get a bunch of troopers or at-at's to run to the next town and kill
Rebels or Imperials.

-You kill the baddest monsters in the game and get nothing but
tradeskill loot?  Hey it was a great tradeskill system, at least
fundamentally, but come on.  I want to kill something with a group of
people and loot some piece of really nice armor or a weapon that makes
me do a whole bunch more damage.  I don't want to kill something and
hope to loot its eggs or skin.
