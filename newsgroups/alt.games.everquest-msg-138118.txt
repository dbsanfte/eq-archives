Often an indicator of whether the graphics card is the bottleneck is if 
you raise the resolution and the game slows down. If you can raise the 
resolution without seeing a drop in performance then obviously your 
graphics card can handle it just fine. That would make any slowdown you 
were already seeing (prior to the resolution change) a bottleneck 
somewhere else in the system. Check out any anti-aliasing you might be 
using as well. Full-screen anti-aliasing causes a big performance hit, the 
higher setting the more slowdown. Color-depth makes a difference too, 
16-bit is often much faster than 32-bit, though on the newer cards it 
seems less noticeable in this area.
