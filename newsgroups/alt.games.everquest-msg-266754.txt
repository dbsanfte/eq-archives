If the church wants to give money to the government, no problem.  If
they want to contribute time, materials, no problem.

But this is a special case, its their space they are donating, which is
fine in theory, but which then forces me and anyone else who might for
any reason react negatively to going into a church to either go anyway,
or to not vote.

In case you can't see how thats bad just in general, lets imagine that
there's a sect of orthodox jews, say in Florida, who on moral principle
refuse to enter a christian church.  And lets imagine that these jews
almost always vote democratic.  A republican comittee is in charge of
picking the polling location.  Do they go for the local firehouse, or
for the local Church of Jesus Christ?

Not because people aren't going to their place of worship, because they
have to enter the place of worship of people they have (potentially
deep) philosophical disagreements with, tacitly supporting that place.

Sure, I'd almost have to let that one go, its diabolicly clever, after
all... but I'd still have to object on the same basis of it being
inappropriate to make all them poor innocent christians enter a satanic
church, even if I do think it might be good for them.

So they are buying government support by donating the space?

This is why government isn't supposed to mix with churches; because we
don't want to support one over another, or any over none at all for that 
matter.

The catch 22 to my arguement is that by refusing to support any, I 
suppose you could argue that I'm asking for support for none.  If no 
church is good enough for the government, maybe none is really "The One"
