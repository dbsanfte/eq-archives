Bullshit.  Of course, the .sig here says "-MJ", so that's becoming a 
predictable experience...  

The sellback for Ornate is about 90% of cost.  The sellback for  fine 
Plate is about 90% of cost minus expenditure of time or plat getting 
padding. (Assuming, in both cases, acceptable cha/faction.)  There's 
plenty of reason to keep doing Ornate as high as 150ish.  I wouldn't 
recommend doing platinum ornate, because 10% of 105pp per bar adds up, but 
other than that, they're comparable.

And I just did Smithing up to 180, so the memories are fresh. :)
