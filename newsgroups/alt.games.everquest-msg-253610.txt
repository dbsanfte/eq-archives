I decided to use the last week of my subscription to start a character on
the test server.  It's interesting ... 9 players in the PoK, 28 in the
bazaar.  No one ... not a soul besides my character ... in Butcherblock
where I was harvesting chips for my new necro.

I realized the population would be lower than a production server
(particularly during the day), but the numbers still caught me a bit off
guard.  What's the server like during prime time?
