The sad reality is, that if your Pali's would just rise up, 
and beat Israel into submission, we wouldn't even be
having this discussion, now would we? So humor me here...
Say I wanted to join your side. Say I wake up tomorrow
hating Israel as you do and want to join your side. And
I also tell you that I want to be on a winning side.
What would you tell me that would convince me that
I was really joining a winning side?  I mean, specifically,
if you were the team captain for the Pali's (as you seem to be),
and I came to you and said, Ok coach, whats our game plan?
Whatta we gotta do to win this puppy?  What exactally would
you tell me ?  What exactally would you have me do ?
