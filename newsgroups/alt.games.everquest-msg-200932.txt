Yeh,

It's a sad fact that you have no real comeback when this happens, but
the other side of it is, just how busy was it?

There is a point where it becomes too anti-social/selfish to expect to
be able to solo bandits in PC, this is one of the most popular zones
in the game and once it gets busy, you have to expect to share it.

Not that it sucks or anything, when it's forced on you though :)

PC is a much bigger zone than most people realize, and the bandits are
popular, beacause they drop reasonable loot, however Shiknar are also
good xp upto 23 or so, and thats usually where I solo from 17ish
upwards.

It's also possible to begin a solo career there from level 6 (or less
if seriously twinked and capable of handing out generous damage)

I love Paludal :) and haranging some of the Jerks there is at least
half the fun for me.

Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana.

Frostfist (41) Beastlord on Stromm.

Otserp (32) Mage on Venril Sathir.

Wikkan (42) Druid on Karana, Nekk (32) Necromancer, Moorbane (26) Warrior, Zinga (32) Bard, etc....
