As of right now and for the near future, your characters remain saved if
you cancel your account. I would hope that they would make a big
announcement several weeks ahead of time should they decide to start
deleting canceled account's characters. But for right now you should be
ok. I once canceled for 3 months and had no problems, a friend of mine
cancelled for about 6 months and just in the past 3 weeks re-activated
her account, no problems.
