The game will still need to have all the playermodels loaded at all times
because any player can appear at any time especially if someone for example
cast an illusion, or gated in their model would need to be available and
preloaded or you would have a massive lag spike while the new models loaded
not to mention it would probably be harder to code. Normally so many models
aren't needed because they are area restricted but players are not.
