Heheh i easily let my sk languor in torpor for that long.  I have played
it a few times, but it took me about a year at least to go from level 14
to level 15.  I then got to level 19 in about a week and a half and then
he basically went back into torpor.  I basically play my druid and
rogue, rogue being my main (though of late my druid has been the one i
have been playing).  I have a level 16 necro, and i haven't really
played it in over a month.  I go through stages like that.  I will
definitely reconsider my skipping of purchasing that spell.
