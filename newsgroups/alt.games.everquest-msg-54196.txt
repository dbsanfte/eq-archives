Go to ToFS and hunt the shadow beasts that spawn on the first floor in
the rooms to the right of the pit as you enter on the first floor. You
won't even need to get any keys or go higher in the tower. They range in
level from 25 to 27 (perfect level for you I guess) and they regularly
drop Gnome Skin armor. There's nearly a full suit of it to be had, stats
are pretty nice for your level, and yes, it's halfling drood wearable.
Here's the tunic to give you an idea:

They also drop a selection of Fading Shadow weapons. Fairly useless
except as newbie twink weapons, but they sell for several plat to the
gnome vendors a short ways away in the Iceclad village. Good money to be
had there.
As a warning, be sure you're fighting them rooted or whatever, as
opposed to melee style. They hit a boatload and are, IMO, a bit of an
undercon compared to other mobs of that level in ToFS.

Also, have gate ready in case the "Large Undead Gnoll" spawns. He can,
and will, randomly spawn *immediately* on the corpse of any random mob
you just finished killing. He's the keyholder to get to the second floor
and considerably tougher than the shadowbeasts, so you might not want to
be facing him at your level after you *just* finished a fight. Pulling
your victims to the entry hall is a safer method, but just be sure you
don't aggro the skellies in the pit. If you have some sort of IVU spell,
I'd keep that up most of the time fighting in there.
