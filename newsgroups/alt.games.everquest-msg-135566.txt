*cackle* I like that mental image.

"Hey baby, you wanna have some fun?"
"Cool, sure!  Lemme just log off my main.... okay.... waiting... logging 
off... okay, waiting for character select screen to come up.  Okay, 
good.  Now select my mule, click enter world.  Loading.... loading.... 
loading.... loading.... loading.... oh crap, I forgot, I dragged him off 
the moon for something.  Okay, asking for a shard.  Now we wait 15 
minutes for the spires to port.  [15 minutes later]  Cool!  Okay, run 
through the Nexus.  Enter the Bazaar.  Ew, lag.  Okay, turn clipping 
plane to 0.  Look down at the floor and look up every so often to try 
and find a relatively empty spot.  There.  Now type /trader.  Make sure 
all my prices are set.  Click on "begin trading" and "list items".  Hit 
"AFK: getting laid, suckers!".  Cool, done!  Okay baby, let's get it... 
baby?  Hello?  Anybody?"

(ironically, any REAL EQ player would probably just shrug at the empty 
room and turn back to begin checking out prices on items they'd like to 
pick up...)
