It's not all that big a deal.  I just started out printing out maps of
areas I know I'm going to be in.  In the two years I been playing EQ,
I've managed to compile my own, pretty impressive map tome.  About the
only maps I don't have at this point are for a couple of the high end
zones in Velious.

Like I said, you don't have to print out the maps for all 100+ zones
at once.  Just for the zones that are a bit more difficult to navigate
(I have a map for South Karana, but I think I've used it maybe ONCE
since I started playing).

While it would be nice if you could buy maps off NPC's in EQ, or even
PC's, I can understand why Verant doesn't do this.  And anyway, I
prefer the option of being able to pick from a number of different
maps to find one that I like.
