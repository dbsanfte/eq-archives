>>Yep, finding a group is damn difficult right now.  Using the LFG flag and
tool doesn't help much, but it looks like more and more people are starting
to use it.  One can hope....

I think a big part of the problem may be that some of the established
players are dusting off there 65 mains and bringing them out to test the new
stuff instead of playing their alts.  I'm thinking that once the novelty
fades, there will be a wider range of players LFG anyhow.  I can't believe
how many 65's I've tripped over in the adv. camps.>>>>

Have to agree with all of this.  There are move 65's showing up on a /who than
I've ever seen and it's been tough to find groups for my characters in the
40's.
