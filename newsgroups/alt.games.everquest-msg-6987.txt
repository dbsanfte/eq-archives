First of all, If you must bash, please pass this post by.

My Son loves EQ and he is 9 years old. He elected to try a Human
warrior cause according to him, "It sounded Tight" whatever that
means.
He is now a level 8 and works hard in groups. He will not let a group
member die, and this gets him into trouble a bit.
 He has this bad habit of following others suggestions like going
where lvl 8 Warriors don't have a chance of surviving.
 Now, I am a Level 19 SK and I can usually get him out of situations
as I have done twice before. But this last time, he lost all the stuff
(Chain Armor, Velium Sword and Shield, ect) that me and his older
brothers have managed to get and give to him. Lesson learned for sure
and I think after 2 weeks of no armor, he is showing more smarts.
 I have spent the last two weeks earning money killing Leggo's, Desert
Madmen, and Willows so I could get enough to get him restarted.
 Thursday is his bday, and today I took the day off , signed on with
his name and began the dangerous task of Drop Transfers.
 I did great and managed to give him my back-up Fine Steel Sword, Lots
of leather, A Backpack,and some food.
 While changing a nice Kite Shield, and 27 pp, I found that it wasn't
there after I dropped it. Guess it happens.

 Now, I have 10pp left and I really would like to get him some sort of
Shield. Could some one steer me in the right direction of where I
could get one for about that price ? (Freeport, WC,EC,Ro)

Its totally different being a Dad as opposed to being "GetsumJ" the
local mouth. And if you help me this one time, I will never bash in
the NG again cause I am really trying to surprise him.

And please, if you despise me, come kill me. Not my sons. That's a lil
too personal.

Tyeg Envil in the Warriors Guild in West Freeport sells a nice looking
Kite shield for around 6.5 pp. While it wouldn't have helped with the
coin, a safer way to transfer items is to put it into a
forge/kiln/oven before you log. It's always possible someone will come
along and take it, but since no one can see it unless they come by and
open it, it is less noticable than a bag on the ground. In any event,
you don't have to worry about it poofing in the time it takes you to
relog. A great place I found in West Freeport is in the south east
corner of the zone, past the monk's guild and near the zone. There is
an abandoned building with an oven inside, I have never seen another
player anywhere near it.
