I am relatively new to EQ and want to get all of my skills up so recently I
tried begging.  I have begged from NPC's more than 200 times and have never
been given a red cent.  I have however been slain numerous times while
begging, even being killed while begging an NPC for the first time.    Am I
doing something wrong here?  It is NPC's that you beg from is it not?
Thanks
