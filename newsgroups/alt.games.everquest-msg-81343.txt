I've gotten very good Haste calculations by getting a sturdy
friend (i.e., high-level tank) to duel me and then let me beat
on his back for quite a while.  This way the tests can be
conducted for a very long time (the longer, the more accurate),
and without such complications as getting hit back and
being stunned (ruins the test) or being riposted/blocked/etc.
(this is why you have your friend turn his back).

Then check your /log file (I use a computer program to
do it quickly and easily) to calculate:

   Q = (number of hits - 1) / (end time - start time)

for both unhasted, and then with whatever haste item
you're trying to measure.  Remember that if you find
any swings that are logged at exactly the same second
as another swing, only count the pair once (because
that's the result of a "double attack",
and not an actual separate swing).  *Do* count misses.

Then finally calculate:

   Haste % = Q(with item) / Q(no item) * 100 - 100

Note that there are two different ways that people
calculate the haste quotient.  Both make mathematical
sense, but give different numbers.  However, the
above method gives the one that is most easily
interpreted (i.e., if it says "21%", it means that
with the item you'll put out 21% more damage on
average than you would without the item).

This method is also the one that most EQ sites
have agreed upon as the "right" way to calculate
and list Haste values.
