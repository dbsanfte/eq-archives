If you subscribe to the forum before EQ2 goes live, membership is
guaranteed.  Sounds like fun - the mood sounds casual, but the guy
running it has a backstroy, with stuff to be revealed as the game

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
