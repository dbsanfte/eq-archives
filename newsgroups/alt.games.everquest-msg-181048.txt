In the 3 raids I've been on in HoT (over 9 hours of pulling and killing),
I've seen exactly 1 piece of chain drop.  Even the stuff the guild has up
for MQ: 3+ pieces of every type except 0 pieces of chain.  /rude.

Personally I figure i'm MUCH more likely to obtain a tae ew chain bp than
EVER see a chain bp out of HoT.

I've heard you can farm enough blood off CT entrance mobs in 1 hour for a
single combine, with that drop rate increasing the further in you go.  How
many pieces of chain do you see drop per hour in HoT?
