This might be quite stupid, but I just don't understand how a "good
race" char goes from Oasis to FV. I have done the trip through the
OverThere (hiding & sneaking all the way !), because it was simple :
get off the barge at Timorous Deep, walk to the docks and get on this
big, funny looking floating piece of... aemm... this boat.

Now, for good races, I just don't understand the maps I'm seeing. Do
you have to actually swim to another island in Timorous Deep after
arrival on the giants isle ? But the boat does not seem to stop on
those...

Now that I am bound to FV, I feel it would be faster to take the other
way to go back to FP. How do I do that ? Where does the boat start /
end ? How do I get to the Oasis barge ?

I guess I could just jump in the boat at FV and see from there, but I
would not want to end in BB !

Thank you !

Jo.
