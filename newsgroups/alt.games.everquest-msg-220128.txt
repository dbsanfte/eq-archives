Another possibility, which would lessen some of the bitching about making
the game to easy, would be to script the first level so as to lead the
person to acquiring this stuff quickly.

For example, turning in the note could get you the bag as a reward.  Or make
it so that the first mob you kill drops a bag.  Perhaps have some quests that
teach you things.  E.g., a quest where the guild leader gives you a couple
things, and asks you to find a forge and combine them there for him and
bring the result back.
