Rock hoppers in DS till you hit 52 use your panic animal spell.
They have a ton of HPs and when they hit you you will feel it.
Be careful when you pull the guards to the cave as they can agro the ones
just inside the entrance.
Loot sucks but there are vendors right next to where you would pull to.
Other nice thing, in a pinch there are 2 zones fairly close.
Watch out for trainers of shrooms.
