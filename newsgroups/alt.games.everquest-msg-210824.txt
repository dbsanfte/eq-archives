3.5blue aka 14% of 56 in 3 hours is really low. Your group was not adequate
to fight there properly. PoD SC and NC or PoN hobgoblins will be better in
some situations: The mobs arent so hard to kill, so you can do more of them.
I have a 56 Pally and dont want do go to PoS or PoV. I think the unflagged
access for level 55 to tier is a slap into a tank's face again. The casters
behind em can go there at 55 without uber gear and benefit from the (maybe)
better XP and loot. A lvl 55  tank below 3k HP unbuffed in tier2? Only a
waste of cleric's mana.

Dont cry about your XP. Melees have much more work to do for it. Take a
skilled group on PoD/PoN and u will get more XP than in PoS with a "one
kill-then medbreak"-style.
