Today, I was playing my 49th Mage and I was sent a tell by a 51st Necro
that I have never met who asked me if I liked my Mage and if I wanted to
trade him characters.  Now to me this reeks of someone trying to scam me
by getting my Account and password but then again I may just be jumping
to conclusions.  Naturally I told him no but I thought about contacting
a GM and passing along the information about what this guy is doing,
anyone have any info or feedback that will be of a useful nature?

No way are you uptight.  There are so many scams, not only in EQ but on TV,
the NET, Telephone scams... it's only smart to be "wise as a serpent".  And
as for ME, yeah I would call the cops over a party :P
