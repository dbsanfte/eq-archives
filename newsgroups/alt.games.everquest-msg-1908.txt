I remember years ago, when everyone tried to make programs as small as
possible. When I was learning, we tried to cram as much content into
even a single line as we could. Of course, this was in the days of
BASIC, when we had machines with 16k ram and no HD. Even in
University, working on a mainframe using FORTRAN 77 (anyone remember
that?), we still tried to write programs as small as possible to do
whatever task was needed.

I remember hearing a story at work that this all changed when IBM
became involved in computers. Because the men in suits had no idea
what computers and code did, the only way they could measure a
programmers progress was by counting how many lines of program they
wrote. A crisp, clean five line program would be passed over for a
clunky 50 line mess. Of course they aren't the only ones, I remember a
friend talking about Baldur's Gate, his biggest compliment was that
the game took 5 cds, as if that somehow made it a better game.
