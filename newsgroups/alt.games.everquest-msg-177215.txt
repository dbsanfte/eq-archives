As others have said, Cabilis is not generally a safe place for elves.

If you're within line of sight of a place that may be unsafe, try (c)onning
the guards. The response will tell you what to expect. Scowling is bad. :-)

Note that all PoK book portals are a safe distance from the guards.

They are not necessarily a safe distance from other wandering MOBs, as the
Iksar I rezzed in Misty Thicket after they were killed by Ella Foodcrafter
could tell you... corpse was literally arm's length from the PoK book. :-)
