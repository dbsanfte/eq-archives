i actually tried quite hard to spell find incorrectly, but it just didn't
come out right.  "fnd" could be read as "fiend" or even "fined," so you can
see my delema (and, if this is any componsation: not only did i use the
wrong "there," but i also misspelled it.  supposed to be spelled their, not
thier, which is contrary to the "i before e except after c" rule that one
gets taught in grade school. but now i'm just rambling)...however, i am open
to suggestions of how to spell the word "find" wrong! (just so i can use it
in the future)  im sry fr nt makng a speling mistak, i hop ths sentance maks
upp fr itt.
