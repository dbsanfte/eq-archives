Most of the rogues I know would range slot the ragebringer if they
could.  15/25 while fantastic, is looking rather weak when you start
talking about velious high end stuff--and some of that stuff is
droppable.

Regardless, monks do not outdamage rogues.
You can take both to their haste cap (BTW monk epics are kinda
fubarred because they are spell haste rather than item haste meaning
you need a haste item of some sort in addition to their gloves to get
them to the haste cap--although, the ratio on those gloves are pretty
freaking godly) and rogue would still outdamage the monk.

Not by a small amount, I mean by a VERY significant amount.

Actually, you can't even get monks to their haste cap using the effect
from their epic because the haste from monk epic isn't high enough.
You still need an enchanter haste to cap them.
