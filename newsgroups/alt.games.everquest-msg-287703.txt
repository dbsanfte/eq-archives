This is from blizzard=92s blue print:
Besides the Player Calendar, many changes have been implemented to
reflect the new content and functionality of Patch 3.0.2
Game mechanic changes: Character profiles and item tooltips should
reflect the changes to character and item statistics including the
consolidation of bonus spell damage and healing into Spellpower, and
the combination of other previously differentiated physical and spell
bonuses into a single statistic each.
Character talent trees have been updated to reflect the many changes
in 3.0.2, including the new 51-point talents.
Glyphs: The new items associated with the Inscription profession are
now searchable in the Armory.
A small assortment of new Honor Rewards has been added to the item
database.

changes in 3.0.2
