Oh, lord, I did DirecTV for nearly a year total. It's much worse. ><
People go apeshit at the drop of a hat when it comes to their TV.
People think that "the customer is always right" means it's okay to
treat the CS people they talk to like shit. It's frustrating and
pretty sad. Honestly, I wish more people dealt with customers like
Gord *points to his sig*. (Apparantly, his "good" customers loved him.
It was just the ones who acted like idiots, abusive or otherwise, that
got "the treatment" out of him.)

Of course, having done DirecTV CS means I can laugh at those Comcast
commercials because 1) I know exactly what would have solved most of
the people's problems (Most would have been solved by tightening bolts
better. One would have been solved if the moron bolted the dish to
that shelf he made rather than just setting it on it. *eyeroll) and 2)
to hear them talk, you'd think cable TV never went out when, in fact,
I lost cable TV every time a big thunderstorm rolls through, and I
lost it during ice storms back when I lived in north AL.
