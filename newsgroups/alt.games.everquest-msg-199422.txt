I understand your pain, my friend.  My main is a class that is
probably the worst soloer in the game. :)  Nevertheless, I was abkle
to solo from 44-48, and since mages get better nukes early and a pet
for flat out damage, it should be fairly easy for you to do what I
did, but starting at 40 - Happ Dremblenod.


Happ is a level 35 (or so) NPC mage in the Lesser Faydark, just inside
the Steamfont IZ. She is a gnome who spawns every 6 minutes.  If given
enough time after she pops, she will cast a pet (water or air, I can't
remember which); you must therefore deal with the pet or engage her
much faster.

For Nick, my cleric, it was a matter or rooting and nuking.  For a
mage, it's probably best to pull Happ with a nuke and set your pet on
her fast.  Honestly, letting her cast a pet and killing it is a waste
of time, as it gives almost no experience and, at later levels, gives
none at all.  Get on her with a fast cast nuke, have your pet ready,
and make sure that you're standing on the hill in front of her camp so
as not to aggro any other NPC's.  You shouldn't; in 4 levels I never
once did, but better safe than sorry.

She took two or three casts of Retribution to kill, depending on if I
dudded out or not.  Retribution does about 500 dmg.  With pet dmg, you
should be able to manage lower level nukes against her and recover
your mana while waiting for her to spawn again.

I won't lie - this does get boring after a while.  The reward however,
is nice - even at 47, I was getting 2.5% exp per kill on her.  At 40,
you should get even more.

Good luck if you decide to do this.  Oh, and watch out for that damned
horse, Equestrielle!  If you see a message to the effect that you've
made your last mistake, sic your pet on her and run to Steamfont,
fast! :)
