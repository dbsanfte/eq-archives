For those bored of this stuff goto http://www.biddulph.u-net.com/pubjokes
for a giggle.
A sample:

A missionary who had spent years showing a tribe of natives
how to farm and build things to be self-sufficient gets the
word that he is to return home.

He realises that the one thing he never taught the natives
was how to speak English, so he takes the chief and starts
walking in the forest. He points to a tree and says to the
chief, "This is a tree."

The chief looks at the tree and grunts, "Tree."

The missionary is pleased with the response.

They walk a little farther and the padre points to a rock
and says, "This is a rock."

Hearing this, the chief looks and grunts, "Rock."

The padre is really getting enthusiastic about the results
when he hears a rustling in the bushes. As he peeks over
the top, he sees a couple in the midst of heavy sexual
activity.

The padre is really flustered and quickly responds, "Riding
a bike."

The chief looks at the couple briefly, pulls out his blow
gun and kills them.

The padre goes ballistic and yells at the chief that he has
spent years teaching the tribe how to be civilised and kind
to each other, so how could he just kill these people in
cold blood that way?

The chief replied, "My bike."
