I agree with you.  I think what I'm trying to say is that a bard's power
comes 80% from his songs, and 20% from his melee (BEFORE being affected by
songs).   At level 40, I know I do a ton of damage with two weapons, haste,
and the level 30+38 DoT's.   With just the two weapons and no songs,
however, my damage is nothing to write home about.
