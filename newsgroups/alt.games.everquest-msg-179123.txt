Trouble is, going off /ooc on someone for something like this is, at the 
very least, defamation of character without supporting evidence. If one 
person disagrees with you, then it has become a lie, at least to them, 
therefore the term slander would apply as well.

I would agree with you though, in that slander should be avoided under 
any circumstances.
