/agree.  I've done the parses that prove this, I really should get around 
to actually posting them noisily on the messageboards.  In the meantime, 
our whole chanter squad are much more hesitant nukers than they otherwise 
might be.

Yes.  You may actually have seen me post that. :)  We discuss which way 
our nukes oughta be pushing in the chanter channel, and try to coordinate 
it a bit, even.

Eggggzackly.  I swear sometimes they think the only safe way to raid is 
have the main tank solo the mob while we all sit in the corner and behave 
ourselves.

True.  And I'm quite willing to let those other pet owners take 
responsibility, the same way I let them take responsibility for say, not 
training us on the way there, or not running ahead of the pull team, or 
not showing up, going /fo /afk, and checking back in an hour.

If we find someone who's truly incompetent and unwilling to learn... We'll 
deal with that when it happens.  We did actually /guildremove someone for 
that last example, a bit ago.
