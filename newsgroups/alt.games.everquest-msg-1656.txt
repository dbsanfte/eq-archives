I've been hunting frontier mountains, and prior to that, highkeep, and have
yet to see any of the components for level 34 air and fire pets...

Do these drop in a more restricted manner, geographically, than other
research items?

I've never considered "random" drops to be truly random, rather I've felt
that the server will begin to send things your way when you approach the
level at which they start to become relevant to you...other spell components
came this way, regardless of where I hunted, provided I was hunting in a
level-appropriate area.

I moved to rathe mountains yesterday, tougher place...maybe I'll start
seeing them.

BTW, I'm looking for:

Words of Duress
Breath of Solusek  (sounds like a Sol drop to me)
Scent of Marr

TIA
