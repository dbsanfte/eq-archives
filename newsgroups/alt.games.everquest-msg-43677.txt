Precisely the way I feel.  I've played EQ since release, and
I can't see canceling my account unless DAoC just grabs me
and pulls me in.  I gave AC a month trial, but just didn't get
into it, maybe DAoC will be like that, maybe not, but from
everything I've read (the good the bad and the ugly as one
poster put it) it certainly is worth as much of a look as AC
was.
