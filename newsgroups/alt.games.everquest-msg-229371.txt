Oh, I don't mind when they ignore me going oom.  I don't mind when they 
ignore they other guy, if I have enough to help out.  but when the one 
and only healer says oom, and it's ignored...then a little bitch aboutnot 
getting a heal when they were about to die?  THAT'S where it gets, oh, 
out of hand (for lack of a better term).  I usually don't take the time 
to bother telling them more than once that I'm oom, and it's usually 
something along the lines of "I'm oom, medding through this fight" or 
something.

I try to get off one or two nukes per mob, and try to be in every 
fight...but if *I'M* low on mana and the group (read that as tank(s)) is 
doing a good job and not getting too close to dead, I'll just med up 
until I either have to get in on it or it's time to move.  Just my style, 
I suppose.  

I have seen a couple of casters that refuse to get below 30%...if we're 
good on time, that's okay, but if we have hit a snag (not enough drops 
for our collection, say) or we are just cleaning up afterwards, I say 
nuke till you drop!  (Healers I always say "let them med a LITTLE at 
least" )

Now I'm rambling.  To summarize, it's when the sole healer or ALL the 
casters say "OOM" and the puller won't stop fro any reason...that's when 
I get to the point of "don't group with that guy again".  And I don't 
keep a real list, just a kind of mental note to myself.  I usually end up 
with the person again later, only to find that he is either 1) much 
improved and groupable now, or 2) really a flake, and now he won't be in 
my groups for sure.

Uh, I'm done now.
