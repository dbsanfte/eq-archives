I made a hasty generalization in my attempts to vent my anger/frustration at
being stupid enough to get involved in something like this in EQ.  You are
correct.

I believe she was manipulative, and I believe I did want to be used on some
level.  It might have had something to do with the fact I was of low level
in the game and inexperienced, without a circle of friends at that point.  I
sought to leech knowledge from someone of the magician class who could teach
me the EQ ropes.  The thought of cybersex crept in later, after I heard
about it and after she and I had hit it off in game for 5-6 months.  It only
just occurs to me that she may have been trying to introduce me to cybersex
as well as the rest of EQ.  She was probably curious about it, and thus
partly her reason for her previous EQ "partner".  I had a moral problem with
the fact she was married and cyberslutting, and yet I still sought the
cybersex.

I wasn't creepy.  As best I remember, I thanked her for the spells and
noticed her horribly ugly dark green robe.  I asked her what robe it was,
and made gentle fun of her for it.  Then I did a /who and saw her level was
30's I think, and I thought, "OOO, she's experienced," because I had no clue
how easy it was to get to 30's.  I didn't ask her what color was her hair,
what her measurements were, whether or not she enjoyed breakfast in bed, or
if she enjoyed having her toes sucked.  I was basically asking her if she
had any friends to play with, and perhaps we could group sometime.  I call
this being FRIENDLY, Annie.  You would back away slowly most likely because
you aren't so friendly, and there's nothing wrong with that.  =)

Yupper.  I said I was friendly, but I'm not THAT friendly.  I don't tell
people I've just met about my pets, my past history, my family.  If I
actually were in a relationship when I had met Winterstorm, I surely
wouldn't tell Winterstorm all about her, in fact I wouldn't have been
playing EQ.  =O

She loved drama, and she wanted me to be a part of her soap opera.  It's too
bad my cheeks weren't chisled well enough to maintain the daytime role.

I had asked if she knew anyone or had any friends to play with.  This was
the wrong question now that I think of it.  She may have thought I was
subtly asking if
she wanted a cyber sex partner.  I was asking because I wanted to know if
she'd be free to group, and I should have asked just that!

No, I would not have proceeded in that case.  But online it's so much easier
to take a chance because you can just /ignore the offender if he/she isn't
to your liking; much easier to evade someone online than in real life.  I
sought a mentor to teach me the game/my class, and I formed an attachment to
her, and I believe she did to me, or so she led me to believe.  I felt I was
doing something wrong since she was married, and even if she weren't, it
still would feel empty, lonely I think.  And yet, I did the damned thing
anyway!  What's worse is that she did as well!  lol

You are correct, and I was a big jerk by telling her husband about it.
However, and this doesn't justify my action, it merely makes me feel better,
she was a jerk to me as well.  She could have stopped it far earlier.  She
could have stopped it when I started questioning what it was we were doing.
And if she wasn't going to stop it, which she did not, then why carry on
conversations with me still as if none of this shit was going on between us?
She had baited me, dragged everything out, and she had done an impeccable
job of it.

The baggage is not worth it.  I had never engaged in such inanity before,
and therefore I knew not whether it was alluring or repugnant.  The act is
empty, frustrating and it can be problematic when a person allows himself to
think there's a real relationship based on it.

We teased each other back and forth, and then stupidly gave in I guess.  One

didn't.  =(

The way I would act online is not the way I am in real life.  I assumed an
online personna of sorts, and it frightened me; that's another reason why I
quit the game.  While playing online, I would be a constant smart ass, with
snappy come backs and sexual innuendo in far too many comments.  This
personna attracted her.  I realized that it wasn't the real me, a latent
reason for my losing interest in her.  She was attracted to my online
personna.  When the real me shined through, and I acted intelligently, more
mature, she wasn't amused anymore.  She had told me she didn't want to think
about things.  She also told me that I assumed too much, that I assumed she
had some kind of hidden agenda with me.  I told her I didn't think she had a
hidden agenda, but rather that I mistrusted her because of her past history
(I haven't mentioned it here), and then again with what she was doing
online (most likely without husband's knowledge).  A snippet from a mail
from around that time:

"(snip)...I'd like to talk to you as we use to without your 20 questions,  I
miss enjoyin your company,
with it being just that, company, not a question and answer session...(snip)
I wanted a friend....or something, and perhaps i dont know, sometimes."

I did mistreat her, yes, and it was wrong, but she was incredibly irritating
at times.  I remember the incident where I had asked her to let me know when
Winterstorm leveled up, I was anxious for when she reached a certain level
so she could scribe the spell I had given her.  She leveled that night, we
gated away from the group I had slapped together in Valor, she was busy
scribing spells and couldn't understand why I was ticked when she had
leveled and not told me.

It wasn't this incident that ticked me off so much as this incident PLUS the
one previous to this, where again she showed me little respect for my
wishes:  She had mailed me some pics, and I had mailed her some.  I asked
her in the mail in all caps, "Please don't show these to anyone else"  (in
other words, don't show 'em to yer smart-ass buddy, Shayne).  The next night
I was on a raid with my guild and I got a tell not from her but from Shayne,
"hehe.  nice pictures".  Instead of her telling me she enjoyed my piccies,
her bud was telling me he had enjoyed 'em, knowing I asked her not to show
them off.  I was, in part, seeing if I could trust her by sending her that
request along with the pics.  It angered and upset me to realize she
couldn't be trusted with a request as simple and straight-forward as that.
I sent her a tell asking why she had showed them off.  She claimed he was in
the room when she checked her mail, so she let him look.  I asked her why it
was that her husband never got a peek at the mail I sent her, but her friend
was able to see the pics.  Seemed nice and convenient.  Mail snippet:
------------
My mail to her:
"(snip)
This message, however, is intended for MELLISSA.

I just realized last night when I got a tell from (Shayne's character)
"hehe.  nice
pictures" that I don't really know what the hell you are doing with all the
mail
I send you.  Are you sharing it with Shayne for a good chuckle?

I accosted you with a /tell last night regarding this and you told me to
calm down. ROFL   Again, you don't take what I say seriously AT ALL.  I
guess it was too much to ask you to honor such a simple request as
keeping the pics private.  I may not know you in person, but I thought I had
at least earned a modicum of your trust and respect.  I am a man of some
humility, but there are boundaries you know.

That's just fine, I'm glad I have entertained you both.  Har har har har har
har har.
It should be for the last time.

Now you and Costello can find another target to mock."

--------------
Her reply:
"This is the last I'm goin to say about this, (snip) I OPENED THE EMAIL WITH
HIM
SITTING HERE, AND HE SEEN THEM, ACTUALLY ONLY 2 OF THEM,  WOW
............................  So maybe I should have opend it with no one in
the room, and again, shayne doesnt care that he has seen a picture of
you. (snip)  Goin fuck me for opening My email, and
someone being here...Ok, everyone I'm goin to open my mail, please leave the
immediate area.  (snip)  Ok enough,
I'm not goin rounds with you over this, sorry he seen them, sorry you're
upset about it, (snip)  deal with it."
---------

So, her showing the pics I asked to keep private MAY have been an accident,
as she claimed, but read her response.  She did a little slapping first I
think.

Yes, she saw this but instead of saying let's stop seeing each other, she
decided to leave it all dangling.  When I tried to reach closure, which I am
unfortunately prone to do, she would hear none of it.  She would avoid all
questions dealing with it, telling me about her cats, her hair, her life,
but not answering my questions.  Specifically, "WTF are we doing here?"  She
didn't like that one much at all.

After the incident described above, where she failed to tell me about her
level gain after I had inquired about it 2 or 3 times while grouped, I
became ticked, she returned the anger, and there was a cooling off period
for both of us.  She told me in mail a couple weeks later that she had fled
to Luclin to give me some space.  That was a good idea.  THAT was the point
when I started asking her heavy questions about what it was we were really
doing.  Subsequent to these question/answer sessions, where I made little
progress in my interviews, she started distancing herself and instead of
blaming it on the question/answer sessions, she blamed it on the level ding
incident.  She wanted a man she could control in the game, not the other way
around.  As soon as I exhibited some form of control, she fled.  A few
months ago, after yet another blow up between us over I don't remember what
(something I did no doubt), she told me, "The more controlling you got, the
less and less I enjoyed it."  And there ya have it.  When I played the puppy
dog and followed along with everything she wanted, she loved it.  When I
dropped the reckless online personna and resorted to the real me, asking
questions about what we were doing, she didn't like it.  She didn't like to
THINK.

It is now a learning experience.  Better late than never.

I picked that trait up from her.

I'm not sure who dumped whom, I don't
think there was anyone to dump because in my mind this wasn't a real
relationship.  It was a little sick fantasy for two lonely people.

As far as being my hunting partner...yes, I wanted to group with her and go
kill stuff.  Apparently she wasn't comfortable with this, though she said
she trusted me.  This may indicate that I didn't take the cyber sex stuff or
the "relationship" as seriously as she did, but I did care about her.  I
didn't care for her the way a husband cares for his wife, a guy his
girlfriend, or a mother for her child.  I was curious about her, concerned
for her, and I cared about her the way you would a friend.  The cyber sex
had complicated this because now she was a cyberfriend?!  LOL  Whatever the
reason for her incessant refusals to group with me, I thought it was
standoffish if she indeed was my "friend".  Maybe she thought I'd get her
alone and cyber rape her?  lmao

I didn't clearly explain what happened.  She would communicate with me but
only when she felt like it, and only talk about WHAT she felt like.  There
were times when I couldn't get her to shut up, around New Year's, and there
was a time (shortly after that) when she had placed all of my characters on
ignore.  It was around New Year's when I started up again with the pressing
questions of what it was we were doing together.  In clich�d terms, I wanted
to be set free, lol.  And yet in my mind it wasn't a real relationship to be
set free from!  Were we "dating" by going to Dulak and doing a boat
together?  When Shayne would come along, was it a threesome?

I acted out in frustration and ire by telling her husband all about this
crap because I saw her as the type to manipulate, have fun with men in EQ,
get whatever goodies they were dumb enough to give ya, have them listen to
your Goddamned sob stories and your marital problems, squeeze out some
cyborz, and then /ignore all their characters once she was done with 'em.
Now my act of trying to hurt him was wrong, but I needed to hurt someone as
I felt I had been hurt.  And who says he would be hurt by that?  I'm not Dr.
Phil, but it was just text, not like we were having actual sex, and it
indicates she had the "wandering eye", and it is best her husband knows.
When I have a problem I need to TALK about it, and she wouldn't respond to
the questions about us that needed an answer.  She had a few questions to
answer for her husband I would wager.

I believe you are right here, but I'd like to add that I was aggressive
because there were questions I wanted answered, which she did her damnedest
to avoid.  I once told her I felt like she was a butterfly I was trying to
net, not to get her alone and cyber sex her, but rather to get her to sit
still for 5 mins. and answer a few questions about what we were doing.  The
more she fled the questions, the more aggressive and frustrated I became.
It culminated in the husband confrontation, about which I'm not proud.

We had become distanced, but I was trying to be the "friend" she wanted in
the e-mail.  Friends ask things of importance to one another on occasion.

I believe she kept leading me on so I could be her backup to play EQ with
when Shayne or her husband wasn't playing.  Plus, since there was an
emotional attachment on my end at least, she could have that plus the
occasional cyber sex to supplement the drab sex life she described to me of
her marriage - A lonely woman's moist dream (fantasy), sex WITH emotional
attachment!  She actually felt romanced and wanted all over again since her
stale marriage took root.

There are people who have NO ONE.  Then there are people like Mellissa, who
had me in the game and wouldn't allow my mind peace.  When she was done with
me for the night, *click* off goes the computer, and she had husband later
at
home, who may have thought that everything was all right with his world.
She wanted a "friend" in me she claimed, and yet she didn't know how to be a
friend in return.

I have no idea why I kept coming back.  But one surefire way to keep from
coming back was to give away all my belongings and delete my characters.  I
knew I would never have the stomach to go through all those levels again, so
this seemed like a great deterrent for coming back.

I wanted to know whether she was interested in getting help for her
marriage.  I encouraged her many times to seek help.  She told me she
couldn't convince him to go.  I asked if she had even ASKED him, she didn't
seem the best at communication.  If she wanted to salvage things, great!  Do
it and I will know and be happy.  If she didn't want to salvage things with
her husband, then WTF was she doing with me?  Was I her new "hopeful"?  Was
she getting involved with men online, with me, because she wanted to move on
from her husband?  Those were the questions I would put to her.  If she
wanted to salvage her marriage and was just using me as an EQ toy, then
fine, I wanted to know (kinky, but I wanted to know)!  She would tell me no,
it wasn't like that at all.  Then WTF was it like?  lol.  She sent me far
too many mixed signals to count.  She even told me, "Did it ever occur to
you that I didn't know what I wanted?"  I told her she needed to figure it
out then, and rapidly before more men who gave a damn about her came along.

By "real relationship", I meant a conventional relationship.  This was a
relationship I guess, but it was warped, as were the two people involved.

What I wanted, on a very sick level, was for her to acknowledge my presence
to her husband.  Yes,
it's cold and harsh, but I wanted him to see that his wife was slip slidding
away.  She gave me indications of this near New Year's, a conversation which
ended with her saying..."When the time comes, I'll sit Joe down and we'll
have a talk."  She was telling me how she couldn't create a ripple in her
life because of her father to take care of, no job, no place to live if she
left her husband.  I'm not as stupid as I've made myself to look here by my
posts, and I realized she was most likely baiting me along with these
comments, so she could continue to have a buddy online.  But if she honestly
WERE thinking of leaving him for an online guy at one point, I wanted him to
see before
it was too late.  It wasn't a good samaritan thing, and I had the ulterior
motive to get back at her through it all for her ostensible manipulations,
but it may have actually helped them before it was too late (if indeed
everything was the truth from her).

No, I would be fine playing online games in a short while, but I choose not
to any longer.  I am friendly in life, and I'm a little too friendly to
people online.
I actually care about people (for the most part) behind
toons, and I'm FAR too curious about the real people who play them.  A real
life will fix that curiosity right up.

I am used to seeing people in real life and not judging them as evil when I
meet
them.  I'm used to seeing people as inherently good, unless I see contrary
evidence.  In EQ, I realized one has to see people as being inherently bad.
There are the bad in real life, but in EQ, the bad don't have to answer to
society or the law.  They can use and manipulate and then *click* off goes
the computer, and back to everyday life.  That's not the kind of "escape" I
want to take from life.  =)    People fighting over "camp sites", men
playing women, women playing men, men playing men who play women, women
playing men who play married women who play with men who are married...women
using men, men getting back at women by hurting them through their husbands.
/head spins.

I'll settle for the simple life, where I am the real personna I present to
people, and not some made up character in a fantasy world.

Lonely, yeah.  Clingy, you betcha.  But it was all in phases, and partly due
to
certain actions of hers.  It's not like she gave me the scrolls, camped and
then I came lookin' for her the next night.  In fact, SHE looked for me at
first.  She was the clingy one!  During my camping of the AC in OOT, I
couldn't get rid of her.  Someone wanted to partner up with her on the
cyclops island, so she ran over to me and pretended she and I were grouped?!
LOL  I should have waved her off, she seemed like a nut case.  That's
exactly what I should have done.  She seemed too eager to seek company.  I
felt sorry for her being afraid of grouping with strangers or whatever her
shyness problem was, and I was attracted to her wit and mischievousness, but
I should have known she was nuts.  I realize it now, and of course it's too
late.

It's again too late to take back what I've done, but I don't want anyone
harassing her.  And I did just want people to say HI to her.

I think she is looking for royal treatment.  She is looking for greener
pastures
and to always be happy, never lonely, never alone with herself to think what
kind of person she is and how she treats others.  Then there are people like
me, people who are truly happy as often as she is alone.

I will be happy someday, just as she will be never be alone.  She will be
lonely, but never alone.

My thanks for your post, Annie.  It was insightful.
