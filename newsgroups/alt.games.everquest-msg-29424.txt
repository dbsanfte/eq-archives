Ah, then I'm raising my price even more.  Nope, not farmed.  It seems
actually pretty rare on Zeb (well, never mentioned anyway).

When I PL my lower levels (and I do...I have a guild to support, and we're
low on too many classes) I take them to the room behind the fake wall, over
by his room and  pull to there.  It's my favorite place in SolA because of
the lack of trains, selection of high level gobs, and that ring (I got some
sort of 50 mana totem from him, too...nice!).  Not farming for loot,
experience farming with a benefit.  In all the /played weeks I've spent in
that room only one person has ever wanted the spot (level 55+), and I've
seen fewer than 10 people anywhere between my room and just south of the bar
room.

Ok, bumping that up to 1k minimum...maybe 2k and see how many people laugh.
