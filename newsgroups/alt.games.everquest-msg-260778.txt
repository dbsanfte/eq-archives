heh, being a bard that DID do some AE kiting in my youth, I still am glad 
they nerfed PBAoE songs like that.. It really bugged me when I found out 
that numerous bards were just setting up gamepads or other such tricks and 
walking away from a swarm kite and coming back 15 mins later to free xp and 
loot in HoH.. that struck me as excessive and unbalancing.. I've always 
preferred charm kiting..requires more finess and strategy than just run mash 
autorun and hold down one key while you're singing a PBAoE and watch TV... I 
DO wish they would of at least given the bards a higher cap on some other 
skills though.. like come on, you  could give us meditate to 50 couldn't ya?
