Ummm...

how can a frost giant at half health (about half green to me) kill me from
full health when I have calafaction, firestrike, grasping roots loaded and
at 80 mana AND in wolf form.  dropping both spells one after the other drops
a frostie by over a full bubble of health.

I really don't care about 'continuing' what I care about is just dump me.

Most everyone (guess what -- you are truely an exception) I talk to has died
far more from going LD than from any other incident type in the game.  If it
was going to cast any single spell then the 1 I would appreciate the most
would be GATE...  I really don't care about the piddeling exp I get from 1
stupid kill vs the 10 to 20 kills I have to do to make up for 1 death.

if they dumped LD folks, the ones who would take the biggest beating would
be clerics --  look at all those 100pp+ per rez they would lose... <grin>

As for your 2.5 years...  Guess what...  I was here at the start too so your
"I've been here longer and know more" bs ain't a gonna cut it.  In case you
don't remember...  LD never showed back then.  it was put in along with the
"keep fighting" logic to prevent the PvP folks from disconnecting from a
fight so they wouldn't lose their stuff on the PvP servers.  Well, from
population density on servers, PvP never flew that well in the game -- the
'blue' servers always won for populations so it would be nice if they took
care of the mainstream players more instead of catering to the slaughter
house sniper jerks from UO land.

I won't go into the 2.5 years of requests from roleplay folks for a RP
server.  There are a lot of variants on the 'kill your neighbor' servers but
I have yet to see 1 server setup for Roleplay use exclusively...  (and, yes
I know about how hard it is to define "roleplay"...  even the folks who do
it can't agree on a fixed definition but, you have how many flavors of kill
your neighbor now and not even 1 attempt at a RP server..)
