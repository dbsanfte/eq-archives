Depending on your class you will *eventually* have to rely on group tactics
to kill anything. As a warrior we lose the ability (non-uber twink) to solo
around 30ish or so. After 50, a group is a must and the style of gameplay
changes quite a bit from that point forward.

Weapon skills will train over time if you use them in combat (good idea for
any melee type), as will the defense and offense, but what you must realize
is casters (save some hybrids) will probably never melee again beyond a
certain level, and so some skills will be not as usefull as they were pre
25ish.
