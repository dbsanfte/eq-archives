Surprise surprise.  I happen to be running a copy of XP that can read my
Linux partitions.  Scared the crap out of me the first time I opened Windows
Exploder and found my good old Madrake drive right there in plain view.  I
haven't tried copying or anything to or from my Linux partition, because it
is Micro$oft, but I may give it a shot on my older system(provided it will
run XP)

Don't do anything I wouldn't do.  And if you do.... Pictures!
