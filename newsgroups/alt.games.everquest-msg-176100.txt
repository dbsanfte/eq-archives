    Destroy Undead >> Condemnation. It does more damage, costs less mana,
has a lower casting time, and has no recast time except the brand-new "base"
time. Even the wizards in my guild are a little jealous of it.

    The first time it happened to us, the first moron that ported through
ran the wrong way and aggro'ed mobs near zone-in. I got to be the lucky
second person to get Fluxed onto the orb, and the aggro'ed mob was still
there. Start running to zone in, and.... two guildmates AFK at portal. That
was one of those "grit your teeth and eat the death" deaths.

    You know, you're the first person I've heard of that clicked the sword.

    You can go pretty far into the room without getting aggro from her if
you stick to the walls, or at least you used to be able to. And she's very
good about pathing back home after chasing someone.

    Me and my +10% Channeling boots have done that a few times. Better lucky
than good!

    The bard that did it was None Too Impressed. And expressed himself in
Mighty Foul Language.

    Then you're in trouble, as the Mail is Flowing Thought VII. Were I you,
I'd aim for the Wristband or the Ring. Both have very useful effects that
don't get upgraded for quite some time,  both will be very big upgrades, and
neither create FT conflicts. The ring, in particular, has a very unique
self-buff that would complement your "mana cleric" style nicely. If you want
a FT item from VT, try for the Rune of Judgement - it's quite common and
very versatile as to where you can use it. And it's also only FT I, so
they'll let you have it.

    Lots of loot is marked by armour type - plate, chain, leather, silk - as
to who can use it. And lots of folks will ask for an item based on the other
things it does. One of our shamans has the Thorny Whatever sleeves, and they
have some flavour of Vengeance on them. He wanted the 90/90 HP/MANA.

    Nobody has an alt you could key? At the very least, parking a mage in
the first blob room is very useful. Useful enough to be worth the time to
PL, Emperor key, and VT key one. You'd also need a character capable of
porting themselves to the zone-in, too, unless you use some evil geometry
exploit.
