This is just anti-Bush rhetoric.  Most of America, Congress, and
hell--probably the world, believed he had an existing and rebuilding
WMD program...and it wasn't based on what Bush told everyone.  And
since you cannot prove a negative, we still dont know that he had no
such weapons.  What would you do in Hussein's position if you had
illegal biological stockpiles, nuclear materials, chemical agents or
the like?  ...and you saw the writing on the wall.  Leave them in your
basement for the US to seize?  Sell them to other countries?  Hide
them?

We lost over a million in the Civil War, hundreds of thousands in
WWII, tens of thousands in Vietnam...

We just broke 1000 in Iraq.

It's tragic and I hate to see it happen.  However, it is far from
outrageous.

Some people called the missiles Clinton used in his attack on Iraq
"Monical Missles".  Some claimed he attacked two seperate countries to
distract from his populatiry problems.  They primarily made those
claims out of bitter, politically-based hatred of Clinton.  You're
doing the same thing here.

...a politically charged chracterization.  We set goals and are
acheiving those goals.  If it wasn't the terrorist attacks by a small
minority of Iraqi dissidents and foreign terrorists, it would be some
other issue you would bring up as the reason "there has been no
progress" and we are "losing the war".

You cannot invade North Korea now.  They have nuclear weapons.  There
is no debate on the matter: we no longer have the option of invasion.

Iraq attacked one of our allied nations; violated multiple sanctions
it agreed to, in part, to win US approval of a cease-fire; shot at our
pilots; and looked to be re-arming (may well have been for all you
know).  Which nations were you referring to here?

Yes, its always a bad thing in some people's minds to piss off people
who want to kill you...otherwise they might want to kill you.

You're right, let's withdraw support of Israel, force all Americans
out of the Middle East, withdraw all our troops and ships from the
area, let the Muslim world drive the Israelis in to the sea, and be
glad that we appeased the terrorists...they'll leave us alone if we
only follow all of their demands.

Appeasement always works.

Reagan policy has proved to be quite healthy for America.  You didn't
really think that we ever came close to completely reversing his
changes to the tax code did you?  We are still living under Reagan
policy more so than we are not...The 1990's included.

You have some kind of historical reference for this?  Where has "raw
capitalism" ever existed, anyway?
