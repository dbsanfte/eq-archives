I still don't get the argument, though.   A 24th level necro casting Shock
of Poison is going to be hitting for a maximum of 146, but he's also going
to get a fair amount of either lesser damage or resists against high blues
or better.   If these buffs do as discussed here, let's assume the necro is
casting as a 28th level necro.   Now he's hitting for a maximum of about
157 which isn't that much better, but he's also getting a more full damage
hits where it would have been partial damage and partial damage where it
would have been resisted.

Your main is a warrior in the low-50's, IIRC.   A basic group might be you,
a cleric, a rogue, a monk, an enchanter, and a wizard for port/evac/snare.
Let's say you have a choice between a 46 wizard and a 48 wizard.  Both
have the same spells.   Which one do you take?   Leaving aside the agro
issues mobs may have on a 46 vs a 48, the 48 *always* gets picked, right?
This spell, if it works this way, would mean that INT casters get the
benefit
the priest casters (especially clerics) have always had:  ability to group
effectively with higher-level melees.
