Oh, I'm sure there are lots of 30s rangers who snare religiously...but
wouldn't you rather do your very nice melee damage for the minimum 3 seconds
(all told) it takes to cast a spell that might be resisted anyway when
there's a druid there NOT extremely busy?  I know that if I had a ranger I'd
prefer the druid did it.  PLAYING a druid I figure that a lot of the time my
job will be primary healer or primary nuker...it doesn't take any extra time
or mana to be snarer as well.
