If his server is anything like Lanys I'd advise against the outside
of Paw.  At 30/31 I couldn't find enough Gnolls to keep up with
my mage's mana regen there.  That's because there are way
to many people camped outside it.

On the other hand I just roared through 31, 32 and am 4 blue
short of 34 in OT in about 12 hours played.  Our members
ranged from a 29 war to a 39 necro.  A healer and a tank form
the core of a good group there, a few OOC's and you should
have a group capable of the constant pulls necessary to
level fast.

If he can pull anywhere near as furiously as Walaking (the
28, 29, 30th warrior - he dinged twice in there) they can get
her to 34 and superior heal in just a few play sessions.  That
will really open up their options.
