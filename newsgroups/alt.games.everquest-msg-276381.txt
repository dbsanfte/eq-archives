Yeah, Paludal makes the xp flow fast.  I "discovered" it in the early
days of Luclin back when Lake of Ill Omen was THE zone for those
levels.  LOIO was disturbingly crowded, and I would frequently be the
ONLY one in Paludal.  Hard to believe; people weren't willing to check
out new zones, even in the expansion they just bought.  Some guildies
and I then decided to group our (untwinked) alts there, and our xp
moved so fast we felt like we were exploiting.  We had our pick of all
the bandit camps, and could pull constantly for hours with zero
downtime, fighting multiples the whole time.  It was frantic and fun.

Last time I was there it was overcrowded, and hard to get into a good
group.  People fought over spawnpoints, charged each other of
killstealing, etc.  I imagine it's different now...
