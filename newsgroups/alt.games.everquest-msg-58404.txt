While this is getting tiresome to the point where you're going to get to
"win" simply by virtue of my losing patience answering your saying the
same shit over and over and over again, two points:

First, it's Usenet. When you come out swinging, be prepared to duck. And
yes, before you start in with your innocent "I didn't say nuthin" line,
I already reposted your exact text for you. In fact, after this
pointless fucking conversation spiralled out into fifty different
subjects, I actually wasted the time responding in *two* lengthy threads
where you were defending your "points" and making statements about what
you said. To clear those up, I tried re-posting for you your exact words
to answer your questions and why I commented on them as I did. Neither
of those posts were answered. (Go figure.)
  But, even at the point of exasperation, I'll try one more time to make
this simple for you. Go back to the first couple posts in the
Shadownights thread. The OP (long since left behind in a search for some
help, sadly) asked four SK questions. I freely admitted I couldn't
answer three of them. I did, however, have some help to offer on the
taunt question, which I gave. You picked out *ONE* sentence from that
whole fucking post and decided to lead off with "LOL. That's crap!" and
then proceeded to offer incorrect information on taunt. This leads to
point number two.

Two: This is a *very* active newsgroup where a lot of people come to
look for, find, and offer information on all aspects of the game. If you
provide wrong information, you'll get called on it. The more polite you
are when you offer it, the more polite the response generally is when
somebody corrects you.

And no....... I'm *not* going to go back for the fiftieth time and point
out what was wrong with your taunt info. Others have helped clear that
up already. As to the following seven hundred other "points" that
spawned off your initial rant when you apparently thought I was pissing
on SK's because I told the OP I hoped he didn't get stuck being MA Tank
too often, they've been beaten to death. I could give a rat's ass how
many characters of what level you have. The fact that you've done the
King's room and I haven't, or anything else on your long resume of uber
achievements doesn't mean that you have everything one hundred percent
right on warrior taunt tactics vs. SK taunt problems in groups. I'm not
100% right on a lot of things. I've been called on stuff here in the
past when I was laboring under misconceptions on many topics, and I
happily admit when I'm wrong and walk away better educated for the
experience. You, however, strike me as one of those all too common folks
who simply can't stand to be corrected if they make any error, however
minor or unintentional it may have beeen.

The only positive thing I see coming out of this is that at least we got
a good discussion on clerical buffing going where I hope to learn
something, while at the same time offering my groups experiences with
using the various healing spells. You're attempting to contribute to
that discussion as well, and I'll (*gasp*) thank you in advance for
adding to it.

Good luck and good hunting to you.
