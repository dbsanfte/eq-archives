I was making my way through the second leg of the Vah Shir bard quest
series.  Someone hunting sonic wolves let me loot a couple jawbones.  So I
bagged them, hit combine and went to look for my notes as to who to turn
them in to.  I don't know if they're lost or I never took good notes, but
now I have no clue who I was supposed to give them to.  I looked to the
several spoiler sites but no-one seemed to have the answer, so I thought
about it and figured it must be Grawfed near the palace.  It wasn't.  He did
tell me thanks for the bloody bag.  So now I figure I need to start the
second (3rd?) series over but I still have no idea how to start it.  I am at
the level where I have the cloak of the Jharin apprentice.  Could someone
please tell me how to advance the quest from here.
