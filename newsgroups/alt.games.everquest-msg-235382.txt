Well, at least they are honest...

I wonder if it will affect me significantly, I did not see any items that 
I turned in seeming to have unbalanced amounts of tribute.  Got a big 12 
for each of the white ceramic bands I handed in that I skilled up pottery 
on a while back.  Largest amount was some 21k for a sword that sells for 
several k in the bazaar.  Biggest disparity in plat value would be a 
couple of LDoN named mob drops that are nice items, but have a high 
recommended or required level, and are too common.
