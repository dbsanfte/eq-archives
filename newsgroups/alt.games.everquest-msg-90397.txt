The # you quoted is the release version not the actual driver file name, and
you did not say what OS you use.
Be that as it may, fyi, I run Win98, radeon 8500 ddr 64 release version
766-04-020129x-2545e which is the beta driver 4.13.9013 released Jan 31 and
I don't have those problems. Just make sure you have the newest driver.
