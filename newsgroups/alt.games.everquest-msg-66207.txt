     Venders of the PC kind, I was assuming.  As soon as
they
implement the PC vender mode, that place is going to be
filled
with mules hawking their wares.  
    The place feel weirdly empty, and I know it's going to
be
vastly different when the change is made.   As I explored
it,
I felt like I had broken into a mall late at night, when 
everything is closed and the merchandise is put away.  I bet
as soon as they make the switch, it will NEVER look that way
again.
