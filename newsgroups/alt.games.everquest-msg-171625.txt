I still can't stand moving about in the Bazaar. Sadly, it is just as
bad if not worse in some of the most beautiful zones on Luclin. Try
Grimling Forest sometime or thereabout. I understand that it is all
just a product of badly outdated 3D graphics code (engine?) in a game
that began several years ago.

Set your clip plane to 0 - every time you zone into the Bazaar - and
then try to keep the objects (players, NPCs, etc.) visable in your
screen to a minimum by looking down as you move. That's the best
solution I've found.
