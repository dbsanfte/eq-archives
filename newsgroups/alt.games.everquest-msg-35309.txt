The big problem is not having snare for soloing and a dumb pet, or a
pet that will turn on you.

I was at CB last night and charmed a royal guard (way green) and used
it to smack Crush and then Dvinn around, until a high level guy with
me nuked them. We were playing around, keeping Crush penned up for the
newbies. I was surprised how long the guard stayed charmed. Dvinn
conned blue to me, it was nice getting revenge on him.
