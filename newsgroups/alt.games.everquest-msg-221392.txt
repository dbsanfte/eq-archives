The main flaw in your argument is that Warriors need groups.  The class has
no soloing ability.  With the current state of the game, Warriors are left
LFGing for hours upon hours once they hit their 50s.  Knights, if they are
made second class tanks, could still team up with one another and go
hunting.  Imagine several Knights teaming up.  They could actually get
decent EXP and be successful.

When Knights were upgraded awhile back and made to be nearly equal with the
Warriors as tanks and retained their ability to generate agro on demand,
they made the Warriors useless except for Raids.  I compare it to what would
take place if Druids got heals that were equal to Clerics.  Then Clerics
would only need to be used for rezzing.
