You should have no problem at all.  When you port in, as soon as you pass
through the doorway to the dragon circle, turn left.  You should see a pass
between the mountains there.  If you follow this to the water and turn left
again, it will take you right to the falls.  Behind them is the city.  If
you've never been, the only things I can think of that may even attack you
are kodiaks and shardwurms.  You could sleep through the kodiaks and still
beat them at your level.  So just keep an eye out for the shardwurms --
they're pretty big -- and you'll be fine.

Yes.
