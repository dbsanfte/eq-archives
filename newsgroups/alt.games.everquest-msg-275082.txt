Have you tried it on test?  I haven't, but wouldn't be suprised if
crafters can make their own components, but at a cost (resource) that
is more intensive than buying it from an alchemist.  It wouldn't
suprise me if they make it so that alchy produced components are better
quality.

Wait and see what happens, it might not be as bad as you think.
