Um, no, Dennis is correct.

Just as the author of the article noted that "They will only make
mention of possible long-term effects to help buttress a short-termist
argument.", so too his arguments were all quite carefull chosen to
promote his agenda.  A fact which did NOT escape the author himself,
nor will it escape you either if you go back and reread his second
paragraph, which begins: "Yeah, yeah, you want some justification for
this assertion. Even though I'm in Soapbox mode, I can see that, so I
will explain..."

Pretending that his examples were not chosen specificly to be
"prescriptive" is at best willfully ignorant.  The author was not at
all shy about presenting his essay as an opinion piece (you do know
what the "Soapbox" reference means, correct?).  Why would you want
to pretend otherwise?
