Speaking of whackos near the West Gate, who is that Dark Elf that runs
around in circles killing things? I think he's gone mad. He stole a

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
