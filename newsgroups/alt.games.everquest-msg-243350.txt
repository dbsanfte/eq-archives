Does that mean that, unless I desperately want a particular skill to rise,
it would be better to spend training points on skills that I use less often
and therefore don't rise particularly quickly by use. eg I have a level 16
cleric, better to spend training in say conjuration or abjuration that I use
occasionally than 1H blunt, alteration and evocation that I use all the
time?
