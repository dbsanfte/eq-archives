Are you referring to the standard Windows task bar?  If so, right click
on it and select Properties, and make sure "Auto-hide the taskbar" is
checked ON, and "Keep the taskbar on top of other windows" is OFF.  The
bar will still show up if you move the mouse too close to the bottom of
the screen, but I usually find I can avoid having it get in my way.
