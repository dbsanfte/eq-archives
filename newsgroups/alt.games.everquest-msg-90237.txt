> I guess almost all races can have a warrior.

Good guess.

>  Gnome warriors are cute but would always be at a disadvantage. Same with
halflings.

?? .. when you get up in levels a bit, and start hunting with decent
equipment and shaman/cleric/chanter buffs on.. there is no disadvantage to
any warrior race that I know of.

I have fought in sebilis with gnome/halfling warriors as our main assist and
truly there is no difference from Ogre warriors as far as effectiveness
goes.. if they are played well in a good team it matters not.

Just so ye know.. I run a 54th barbarian warrior (my first prime) .. and a
56th cleric.
Buildin a chanter at moment in my 'spare' time (42nd) .. and others ..so I
have seen action in my face and from the back row :)
