Okay, but that doesn't eliminate the need for you to
make choices and make the "right" ones.  Even with
that belief, you still have to exercise what seems to be
"free will."  You'd just have a belief that all will work
out properly in the end, regardless of any mistakes
made along the way.

Only because you can step outside the frame of reference
and judge that way, something you won't be able to do
with this topic until death, if then.  Even that assumes the
"error" is with the person who doesn't see green instead
of with the "common" viewpoint.   Just because the vast
majority of people believed the world was flat didn't
make it so, right?
