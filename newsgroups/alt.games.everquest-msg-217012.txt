Last night we were in LDoN.  We had the slow curse that screws up your attacks.
 We had 5 minutes left.  We snuck to the named, (it was an assasination) and I
soothed all I could.  Anyway, we still ended up with 4.  The 2 tanks were under
half health and the mezzer was OOM and the named was red to some of us and no
one was twinked and we were hitting slower than slow.
I called for the druid to port us out.  Another guy yelled no keep fighting. 
When the main tank fell to 30% and we didn't have the named killed, (much less
the others), I /G PORT US OUT NOW!
The druid did.  One guy was mad.  Said it wasn't the clerics decision to make
it should have been the group leader, who was busy getting his butt kicked. 
Who normally makes this decision?
