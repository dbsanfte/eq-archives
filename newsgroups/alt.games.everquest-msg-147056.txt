Well, I meant un-paladinlike in his rudeness to a lower level character 
working on increasing his skills, especially while helping to fight evil 
too, and it also seems like there would be just as much other evil out 
there more appropriate for higher levels to concentrate on, but I am new 
to the game and having trouble adjusting to the emphasis of most players 
on statistical gaming rather than role-playing. I am quickly learning 
all the ways in which I am wrong. ;)
