it's definitely for sale somewhere in neriak.  bind affinity is a spell
that all casters get, so it might be for sale in a different guild.

try looking in the clerics guild (its in 3rd gate zone, in the middle
of a lake.  you pass by it when going to the necro guild) or the
magician/enchanter/wizard guild (in commons zone, near the forge house.)
