On the other hand, imagine 40 people from Qeynos going over and standing
around outside Freeport, and the people from Freeport can't do anything
about it, because the Qeynos people haven't turned on their PvP flags.
That's WoW, too.

The PvP in DAoC makes much more sense.  There, if you run into someone from
one of the other realms, you can fight them.  If you don't want to
participate in PvP, you stay out of the frontier.  If you want to go and
taunt people from another realm, you have to be prepared to back that up
with force.
