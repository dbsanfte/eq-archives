There is nothing wrong with killing enemy combatants.

Rash???  That's what you call it???  Please!  That wasn't rash, it was
planned out in small detail, steps were taken to bring everything into play.
It was nowhere near "rash".

And it had nothing to do with Palestine.  Bin Laden wanted power.  It has
nothing to do with ideals.

So that he becomes an instant celeberty in the arab world.  That's neither
rash nor stupid.  Hell, nothing happened when he attacked the U.S.S. Cole,
so why should there be a problem with attacking the WTC?  He forgot that
there was a new Sheriff in town, though.
