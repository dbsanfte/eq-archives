Its not a question of which mob: all mobs at a given level con exactly 
the same to someone at another given level.

I can't immediately say which of you is correct, but I can propose a 
simple test to find out:

Go to the Bazaar with a level 65 character, use /who 47 to find a level 
47 person, fire up bazaar mode and use find trader to get to that 
person, then con them.

Repeat for level 48, 49, 50

This should pin down the DB/LB line.  You can probably get away with 
just doing it for 48 if you just want to prove/disprove the notion that 
48 (and by extension 49) are DB at 65, the reason for the 47 was to 
establish that the 47/48 split really is the dividing line, if thats 
correct, and the reason for 49 and 50 is to establish that 49/50 really 
is the dividing line if -that- is what's correct.

Of course if your 65 has track it should be even simpler... and I'd 
actually guess that you could stand around near anyone whoring out KEI 
and find plenty of people in the 47-50 range without having to bother 
with the whole trader mode thing.
