one way to build faction with the halas peoples (boring as hell)
step 1: There's this dark elf lady rogue that pops at night in freeport..
she gives a positive hit on the halas warrior faction. The only faction in
halas you can get by killing someone. Kill her about 2 million times to get
'dubious'. All the rest of the people you can kill for this are inside
Neriak. all trash your faction with the Neriak Rogue guild.

Now go collect about 200-400 gnoll teeth in blackburrow, and get camo to go
in to see the lady that gives you the gnoll teeth quest (in the halas
'arena', barbie warrior trainer).

Get behind her, drop invis, and turn in teeth in stacks of four till your
eyes cross.
Eventually everyone in town will be dubious or better.

Don't even think about wolf form the barbarians are kos to wolf form..
(nggg?).

You MAY be able to do this part without step 1 as a monk by sneaking behind
the quest giver for part 2... I dunno.
