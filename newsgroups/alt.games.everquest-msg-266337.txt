Way back on my first character, I was lucky enough to explore lower guk
with a group of adventurous people when it was completely empty. It was
the most fun I have ever had in Everquest. Working our way down the
undead tower to the lower levels, fighting to the area with the live
king, hell, finding those mobs in the first place, was a great adventure
and the memory of it is probably something that still keeps me playing
Everquest and buying the increasingly crappy expansions.

Two weeks later the first maps to lower guk were posted and the crowds
flooded in. Personally, I hated the place after that. I started another
character on a new server in Aug99 and got to guk several months later.
It sucked. Every spot was camped, the ooc conversation was the usual
mindless chatter and accusations of mob stealing from other people's
camps. Needless to say, I am a fan of instancing done right, something
SOE hasn't managed to do yet. No Fantasy novel I've read, and I've been
reading them since I was a kid, ever had the heroes arrive at a dungeon,
tower, or whatever, and find their goal camped by someone else. The
final battles against the evil whatever they set out to destroy didn't
require putting their name on a list. I think non-instanced dungeons
blow immersion out of the fantasy adventure completely.

Those that put up more content as the solution and hate instancing
ignore SOE's consistant refusal to spend a penny more than they can get
away with shoving shit out the door in the last 5 expansions. They won't
ever add enough content to thin people out the way an instance will,
hell they wont even spend the money to design an instanced dungeon that
is one tenth as interesting as any of the original dungeons in the game,
because that takes talent and they don't seem to have the ability to
hold onto any. From what I'm hearing, WoW instanced dungeons actually
are fairly well designed, so maybe I'll end up there once it's out.
