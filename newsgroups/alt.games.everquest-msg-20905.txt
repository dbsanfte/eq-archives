Many of the spells?  Which ones?  Invoke Fear is on the situational list, thats
the one I don't run indoors.  Hmm, Strike maybe, I rarely pull indoors.

Yes, Superior if tank heavy, Great for robe based groups.
DA - and- Gate would mean taking a second slot... which one would you
kill?  I use all the spells on that list regularly, and feel a little selfish
taking
-one- slot for self preservation  Kill one of the stuns?  Now I can't do
chain stun.  Kill the root slot?  What if I need to park adds?  Kill
celestial?  No chance thats ever going to happen, there's no better spell
in my lexicon.  Kill the second heal?  Unfortunately as good as celestial
is, there are circumstances where it just isn't enough.  With Superior up
as a supplement I can keep any tank alive till I'm OOM, or with Great
I can slap a fast patch on a robe long enough for the "get it off me" team
to get to work.  Less efficiently Great plus Celestial tends to get
tanks thru tough spots, while Superior, though a waste, does work
better than Celestial on robes who are aggroed by high damage mobs
that are killing them in just a couple rounds.

And you can tell I was raised outdoors... any time I'm in a situation where
fear can't be used I grit my teeth about how inefficient -any- strategy other
than fear kiting is.  For about 4/5ths the time I play Fear is my job one,
has been since I first got high enough level to group.

Aye, as I level up travel spell load is less and less important.  Finally
breaking
down and buying TBoots may be the straw that breaks the camels back
as far as bothering to swap in a "travel load..." I always have good old Stun
memmed, anyway, if I just pop flash of light in my "situational" slot there's
not
much I'd need to worry about.  Thinking of a spell I overlooked long ago,
Wave of Fear.  Good if attacked by a cluster, or no? (outdoors headed for a
zone line, that is... sure don't want 4 mobs who went running to their various
mommies -all- coming to formup)

I"m not a fan of DA, never memmed it at all till I hit about 39.  Course this
is my second cleric, first one had it as an always up.  I just can't afford
the slot.  Until I started regularly imbibing SOW potions, DA while
travelling just meant I lived 18 seconds longer, rarely long enough to
get to a zone line.  Now in a dungeon, with a group, DA gives people
18 seconds to stabilize the situation and get mobs under control... without
it they'd have to do the same thing without knowing that a cleric would
be available again shortly (since I'd be dead)  The new DeTaunt factor
might make it more viable at low levels, when they finally added it I was
already in my 40s

I tried it root-nuking, and got the same result.  It wouldn't hold worth
a damn, so I had to root nuke root nuke... while Enstill would usually
let me get in three or more nukes.  Since it costs more and works
worse, its not a root and shoot spell.

I do have a use for it though; immobilize/snare/fear means just one
nuke gets the mob running, while it was -never- allowed to touch anyone
till the snare/fear combo stuck.  Too bad I use Stuns for this purpose.

Yep, to me if I'm facing reds I can't stick spells to, its a raid whether I'm
in one group or four.  Primary difference would be that gate versus DB...
in a real raid I'm going to DA or DB and /q, while with a group I'm more
often not in a "safe" spot, and gating back to the safe spot I bound at
works better than dying and ending up at the same spot naked.  I don't
care much about the exp loss anymore (oddly, I always get a 90% res)
but am thinking chiefly in terms of the best CR situation for the party.

All the words are cleric suicide.  The word heal line is workable when
you have a bunch of mezed mobs around you, at least, while the
word damage ones will wake em all.  Its also handy for post battle
mass heal where everyone has appreciable (but not Complete level)
injuries.

The knockback component did occur to me as possibly the most interesting
feature of sound, haven't been in a situation since getting it where
re-arranging
mobs would be useful.  Man, with all the time I spent while younger yelling
at the party to "move away from %T, its ROOTED" I wonder if I can forcibly
create enough range to get mobs out of combat range with this while they are
rooted?

Did the math, and sound is more mana efficient than wrath, discounting the
stun effect, which would be handy in stopping runners (greens being pretty
much all runners when a 49 cleric lays a finger on em)

Drakes.  They have a 500 damage proc which also works as a debuff.  Doesn't
take your major stun team to stop em though, one cleric, chain stunning, while
someone kills takes care of it 75% of the time, and one little fear if you have
a
snarer handy stops it 75% of the time too (occaisionally fear breaks and they
get one off before you resnare) while if you are belt and suspenders like me,
you snare/fear em and then chain stun, you see no more than one proc in ten
drakes killed.  Assuming the robes keep their distance from the action, letting
one proc slip by you in a drake fight isn't a big deal, and I've never seen more

than one make it thru.

On the other hand, pulling em is a pain, they are slow and have a short follow
distance, and you can't keep em from casting while you pull except by keeping
the distance and speed just right.  Do it wrong and you get 500points damage
plus debuffed, one managed to strip my HP buffs and my lev, which dropped
me off to the ground at cliff height!  I think that was an effective reduction
of
over 1500 hp in one shot, what a lucky drake!
