That's been my experience exactly. Whatever you may think of McQaid, he was
very clear about laying down the law and enforcing it.

It's funny. I was reading the CoH forums the other day and one of the
designers made a fawning reference to Raph Koster's apparently seminal work
in the field on "How to run a MMOG" (warning: I'm paraphrasing liberally). I
remember viewing Koster's presentation a long time ago and in particular one
of his commandments "Exploits need to be punished loudly and publicly". I
remember reading this and thinking to myself "Why the hell didn't he do this
himself in UO and SWG?" I remember all during the time that I played SWG
that there were numerous, well-known exploits ruining the game and nothing,
not a peep out of game management.
