One thing I've found helpful fighting in zones with debuff casters is to
have item based clicky buffs.  On my rogue, I typically will have in the
first five slots:

Miraculous Visions (from a PoP ornate hand item, 30% haste)
Heart of the Void (from a Luclin chest item, HP +225, CR & MR +40)
An illusion (clicky bard/rogue mask)
Aura of Rage (from the Fabled Shrunken Goblin Earring)
Thorny Shield (from Crystallized Serpent Eye)

It's pretty rare when I lose something beyond these first buffs.  If I go to
SG, I also carry a Rebreather, which is an Enduring Breath item.  This way I
don't have to worry about having EB dispelled.  My shaman also uses a couple
of clickable buffs (Fabled Tiny Gobby Earring + some random DS enhancer he
got when I registered a retail version of GoD), plus the Serpent Sight spell
(so he can see in dungeons).  KEI is usually in the third or forth slot, and
has yet to be debuffed.

Hope this helps.
