Being a monthly subscription fee based profit plan, the entire "game" is
designed to use up time so you pay additional subscription fees to obtain
your desired advancements. If you are not enjoying your time in the game and
instead trying to "beat" everquest then by all means vote with your wallet
and leave to do something you do find entertaining, you seem to have already
made your decision. I am sure this won't make you feel better but perhaps
for some other poor soul that does still pursue the Ancient Cyclops in SRO,
My best luck with it is when I am not even looking for it, just passing thru
and bam there it is so I drop him and get someone a nice surprise gift.
