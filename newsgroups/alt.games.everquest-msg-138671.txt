I assume this is your peridot buying stein?

You haven't listed your stats, so I don't know
how necessary this is, but there is now a potter
made stein that is CHA 25, and not lore, retails
for around 100pp.

You want your Cha up to 106 when buying
peridot and invis potions and sundry cleric supplies.
If you need it, one or two of these (opal encrusted
stein?) little numbers will save you a fair number
of PP per stack.

As a dwarf (base cha of 45 or 50,  I forget) I actually
need two of these plus a head piece out of Kael
in my "buying" kit... and not wearing them literally
means paying 15pp a peridot instead of 10pp
