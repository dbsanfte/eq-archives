The only time you can get skill ups from greens is very rarely when
you are below level 7 as I recall.  Of course, I may be remembering
fron they days before teh light blue con.  

Best way is to ask a group if you mind whacking on their mobs for
skills.  They get a little more DPS and you get skill ups; possibly if
a member leaves you get a group invite.
