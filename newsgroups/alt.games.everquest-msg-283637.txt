Keep in mind that just because they walk off doesn't mean they forgot
about you.  Roaming mobs reset after a set period of time, I think a
few minutes though I have never counted.  You get a message saying they
have forgotten you.  Static mobs forget you once they get back to their
spawn.  If you only agroed static mobs, you will never even get the
"forgotten you message" as far as I know.  One rule of thumb when
splitting mobs: if you are splitting a roamer and a static mob, try to
get the roamer and leave the static one since the roamer will take so
much longer to reset.

Also note that things change from lower to higher levels.  From around
1-50, mobs will forget you almost as soon as you feign.  After that,
suddenly they begin remembering you until they get back to their spawn
or reset.
