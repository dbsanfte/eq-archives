On Brell, as I imagine on other servers, a global auction channel now
exists. One day while medding in CScar I joined this channel and after
a time got into a discussion about why there were only 20 odd people
on it at the time.

The upshot of this is that not everyone had figured out how to
properly use (or abuse depending on your viewpoint) the global auction
advantage. The following is presented for those newer to the game who
might not have put 2 and 2 together yet:

Step 1- Decide what items from your bank you wish to sell or what
items you wish to buy. Selling items you do not carry on you makes
this a little easier.

Step 2- Create what is known as a 'mule'. That is, a level one
charachter who's main purpose in life is to store items or run minor
errands for your main charachter(s). If you have a charachter you no
longer play much, they can also fill this role.

Step 3- Transfer the for-sale item(s) and or available pp to your
'mule' with the help of a trusted confederate. Guildmates and/or
people you know in RL are especially good for this. There are a number
of tricks to transfer items and pp without third party help, but all
of them that I know of carry a fair degree of risk (lost items, etc.)

Step 4- Get the mule to a safe, well known, and preferrably neutral
area and have them camp out there. The GF spires and the EC tunnel are
both popular for this as even a level one charachter can be reasonably
safe. If you have Luclin the bank in the Bazaar is perfect unless you
have managed to get bad faction with the bankers/guards there.

After you have done the above you play as you normally would. Every so
often you advertise what you are buying/selling on the auction channel
until such time as you get a buyer/seller that meets your terms. When
you do, you arrange a time to have them meet your mule charachter for
the actual exchange of items and plat. When you want to transfer the
funds or items to other charachters, you simply perform step #3 in
reverse...

Just my 2 cp worth. Use or ignore as you see fit.
