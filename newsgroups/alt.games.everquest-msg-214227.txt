Grr, is my newreader doing that again?  I told it "never HTML!"
Been clean and sober for over two years and now the damn thing is
back on the bottle I guess.

  Nice work - way to put words in my mouth and totally
misrepresent the
  situation in a lame effort to portray a very reasonable rule in
a bad
  light.


I'm not putting words in your mouth, I'm suggesting what the
rules seem to mean.

I don't see how a cutoff, any cutoff, is "very reasonable".
Contributing to raids should mean getting compensated, and it
looked to me like the rule as you stated it
denied that compensation to people under a certain bar.  Your
further explaination shows that its more well thought out than
that, has mechanisms in place to prevent
it being quite so much a denial... but I still don't like it.

Then again I don't like any raid point system, so I'm not a fair
judge of this one, which seems to me to be only a bit worse than
the usual run of the mill system that
gives the top 10% of a guild about 50% of the loot.


  Let's say I've attended 54 of the last 90 raids (60%)
  Then RL interferes and I can only attend 4 of the next
  10 (58 of 100, or 58%).  Given that we have 4 raids a
  week, how long is it before I get back to 60%?

  Quick hint - 4 straight raids and I'm there.  Am I being
  screwed during those raids? No.  Why?  Because I accrue RPP
  that I can spend the moment I get back to 60%.  Hell, I've
  gone more than 4 raids straight without getting loot because
  nothing's dropped that's worth the stinking RPP to me.
  Especially since the Rhags just gotadded to our "All hands
  on deck" list, and one drops a VERY nice mage item that I
  want.

  I realize you left a guild because you didn't want to raid
  with your cleric.  But I joined this guild knowing full well
  the raid policies.  They are geared toward advancing as a
guild.


Thats not accurate, I left the guild because there were raid
targets I didn't want to kill, and they were becoming less and
less understanding about my continuing to
not do them.  Further, the guild wasn't offering me exp groups
or anything else; so I was not raiding with my cleric, not
grouping with any character, and essentially
was not in the guild as far as getting anything done for the
several months beforehand.  The last straw came when I was told I
shouldn't bring the 57 bard I'd
dedicated a couple months to leveling up specifically as a way to
attend those dragonkilling raids my cleric wouldn't go on,
because he was too low level and not my
main.  Pretty much the guild saying "our way or the highway" as
far as I was concerned.

I also joined the guild when they -weren't- all about advancing,
and weren't killing COV dragons, they changed and I remained
constant.  You aren't in the same
situation, I'll grant you.  But I still maintain that -if- your
situation has changed to the point where you can't keep up 60%
raid attendance anymore, then you should
drop out or face the fact that accumulate 10,000 raid points and
you still won't get a single crushbone belt.  If you are just a
little behind and are sure you can catch
up, no big deal, still getting points and they'll be spendable
later.


  Are they perfect?  No.  As we approach the end of the year it
  is possible to get far enough behind to make it difficult to
  get your raid percentage back over 60%.  Did the officers just
  say "screw you" when this flaw was pointed out?  No, we have
  a policy that allows people to go inactive while RL problems
  keep them from raiding, and not lose ground.  We are also
  experimenting with allowing people to buy raid attendence
  percentage points with RPP - so if I'm at 59% and something
  I really want drops, I don't have to wait for my percentage
  to reach 60, I can just buy the 1% attendence credit, then
  bid on the item.


Resets every january first?  Sounds even zanier than I'd
suspected.  But I guess its a way out of locking out the low
attendance people entirely.  And then you have
other fixes, or at least are discussing them.  Sort of like the
US tax laws, put in place a funky system and then pack it with
duct tape patched duct tape patches over
the holes in the holes... maybe it will become something flexible
enough to work eventually.


  For those people who scream "but I have a life outside EQ!"
  12 raids every 5 weeks is hardly a lot of time.  Unlike my
  previous family guild we assemble on time, prep quickly and
  are actively raiding very promptly.  Our weeknight raids start
  at 4pm pst and rarely keep me in game past 9pm.


Two raids a week, I can't imagine presenting a guild as
"advancement oriented" with a schedule that light.  Why even I
could maintain 60%!
