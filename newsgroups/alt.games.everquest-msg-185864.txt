Uhh, I wasn't hugging the zone wall, the canyon extends quite a ways
out into the zone, but  I was close to the mouth of the canyon. I'm
high enough so I don't aggro wandering mobs from far away, and there's
not many that path over there anyway. While I can't say exactly where
I was along the canyon, I fell for maybe half a second and was hit for
20K. Yes, I was at full health (about 2.5K hp) and not encumbered.
I've never fallen for 20K before, so I hadn't paid much attention to
it in the past. I'd heard that falling for 20K was a bug, so I asked
my guild and the serverwide class channel if it were a bug or not, and
everyone said that it might be and told me to do a /report and the GM
would investigate, so I did. I did a /report that said 'I just fell
for 20K in Great Divide'' (and realized afterwards that I was actually
in EW). Then I immediately logged off and went to the web site, and I
swear by my station name and password this is EXACTLY what I reported,
with no additions or deletions, from the email that the GM sent me
that said I could get a rez:

I did a nosedive off the side of the canyon at the entrance to
Kael, but I didn't fall that far and was hit for 20K damage when I 
landed. I thought I had lev on, but I had left my character in the 
bazaar, and one of my family members came in and turned off my effects
window when trying to get out of the program, so I didn't see that it 
wasn't on. After I fell, I submitted a /report (during which I 
accidentially reported I'd fell in Great Devide), then retrieved the 
items from my corpse, but as it wasn't visible in the side of the 
canyon, I had to run around madly hitting my /corpse button. I dragged
it to the entrance of the canyon before thinking that I should have
left it where it was.

Note that nowhere, ANYWHERE did I _ask_ for a rez. It was offered to
me by the GM. I also mentioned that I had moved my corpse. Jesus H.
Christ. I should have known better than to put anything but the barest
details down on this group. Next time I'll just ask my questions
without any background. I started playing right after Kunark, and this
makes time number 3 that I have ever had to contact the admin for
anything, so I doubt they're wasting excessive amounts of time on me.
My server just has an inordinently friendly GM, I guess, but for God's
sake, by some of the replies in this thread, you'd think he'd agreed
to port me to Sleeper's Tomb and instakill the Sleeper for me. Geez
people!
