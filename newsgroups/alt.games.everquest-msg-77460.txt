We just started playing EQ and I am not having problems on my computer, but
my husband system locks up and crashes constantly, even tho it is a faster
system.  I called tech support and was told that the video card that he has
is not supported.  We are already investing a lot of money to play this game
because everyone in the family wants to play.  That means 4 accounts, 4
copies of the disk and we have to upgrade both kids computers.  So, we don't
want to spend a lot on a video card.

Does anyone know where I can get a good list of supported cards, or do you
have recommendations as to an affordable card that works well?

Thanks so much
