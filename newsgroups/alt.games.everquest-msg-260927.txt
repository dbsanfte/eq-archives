Yes, I've turned off the music, but I like having the sound on so
I can have a clue if there's a battle going on around the corner
or something.  Not to mention that sometimes it's what warns me
that someone's casting a spell, which gives me a few extra seconds
to start responding to whatever that implies.

So I too hope that it's possible to turn off the voices, or that
people will be willing to use them in moderation so that that really
do let me know about things I need to hear.
