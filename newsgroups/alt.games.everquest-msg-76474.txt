It's hard to come up with a best class because some classes excel against others
and even a well played but weak class can do very well in certain circumstances.
I've actually seen clerics as an example beat poorly played melees on red
servers in high level pvp.

Bards are an excellent support class, outdoors they are almost unkillable.
However they lack damage and killing ability. They have a hard time killing
anything but a caster and at level 55+ even those become difficult. They excel
in group combat, as useful or even more useful than an enchanter. They can buff
resists to insane ammounts, interrupt gating casters and make melees run at
super fast speeds making them hard to escape, not to mention occlusion being a
very nice debuff and the ability to easily cancel protective buffs.

An epic rogue with a selos horse and a golem wand is a bard killer however.

Pvp in EQ is a funny thing. Level, resists, hp, skill, class, preparedness can
all come into play and the opinion of what is the best class changes from week
to week.

My current favorite for a caster would go to Wizards, Luclin buffed them to
insane amounts in pvp. Criticals alone do tremendous damage and manaburn is
instant death. Shadowknights would be my favorite for melee, the pet, ht and
very good melee damage gives them an edge over even Wizards, they can be
countered by a Enc/Wiz duo though. Rapture is nice.

For best all around, pve and pvp I would go with a Necromancer. They are more
than capable in pvp and imo the best exp solo class in eq.
