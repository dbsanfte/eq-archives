}> Heheh, another lovely little known lizard fact: know anything about
}> the gender and mating habits of the California Whiptail? :)
}No.  I could look it up, but its easier to ask you to explain ;-)

Actually, I'm not sure it's -just- that species, so it might have been 
hard info to find.  But it's like this:  the entire species is female and 
reproduces by parthenogenesis...  I actually don't know if they have any 
sort of 'sexual behaviour', but if they do, it's a sure bet it isn't for 
reproduction.  At least, not in the traditional birds-and-bees sense. :)

}> Is this the tortoiseshell thing?  As I recall, what coloration the
}> cat has is genetic, yes, but the actual distribution of the colors is
}> determined after birth by a variety of factors that I can't remember 
}> for sure... Oh!  I think it was sex-linked, and relates to which x 
}> chromosome contracts into a barr body at some stage of development.
}Ah, clearly I was explaining something you're more informed about than
}I am!

Dunno about that, it's an old memory for me.  You may be more recently 
informed. :)  But yeah, my degree requires genetics, and torties are a 
really good example of that sort of thing. :)

}The specific example I remember was a cloned cat that was
}mixed white and tabby.  The size, shape, and distribution of the white
}areas and orange tabby areas where completely different on the two
}cats, and the clone was the same gender as the original.

Hehe, yup, here we go, scroll down to 'limitations of cloning 2, colour 
and pattern'.
http://www.messybeast.com/clonecat.htm

}IIRC a "tabby" by definitin as two colours on each single hair, and
}both males and females can be tabby (or tabby spotted with another
}colour).  Only females can be tortoiseshell, with three colours
}intermixed in the same area (with or without patched of another
}colour).

Apparently, the cloning scientists announced they'd made a tortie, when it 
was obvious from the picture it was a tabby and white. :)  Of course, the 
donor was a tortie, so naturally, they would have expected that result...  
Oh, this also explains what you meant about the coat color being 
determined before birth.  In the cloning case, they used a genome from a 
mature cell in which the x chromosome had already been inactivated.  That 
wouldn't have happened in 'normal' reproduction, though.

}> There are a few traits like that, although I don't think coat color
}> is generally one of them.  Theory suggests that it is related to the
}> makeup of the rest of the fertilized egg, ie, whether it ended up
}> having certain key proteins in a sufficent amount pre-made.
}So that two genetically identical eggs would still develop
}differently, then.  Whis is what the breeders pointed out to me,
}indirectly.

Yup yup, it's one of the reasons identical twins aren't -exactly- alike.  
the other being that they grew up a bit differently, of course. :)

}> }3- Traits built on a complex combination of genes- a clone would
}> }inherit the trait, but most offspring would not.
}> Yeah, that's just genetics. :)
}And then there's genetics.... seems every herp forum is filled with
}questions like, "What do I get if a breed a
}hypo-something-super-otherthing with a 23.456% het for albino...."

Yup, I was just looking at about a million pages like that, had to 
figure out how to narrow the search somewhat. :)

}> Heheh, and I suspect, -if- sexuality is genetic, it's definitely in
}> category #3.  That's where current research is pointing, at least.
}> that said though, I still don't like it.  I like free will.  It's good.
}Well, you know that free will thing is easy to prove.  Just get all
}heterosexuals to decide to go gay, and the point can be proven by
}exhaustion.

Nah, that wouldn't prove anything, they might just be pretending to be 
gay.  :)  And there'd be the same problem with the inverse experiment, of 
course.  Plenty of people have 'switched' in either direction at some 
point in their lives, for whatever reason.  But even that doesn't -really- 
show that it's choice, since they could have just finally figured out why 
their sex life wasn't working out very well, or become delusional and 
decided to deny their 'true' nature for some reason.

I did find this site pretty interesting on the subject, though:
