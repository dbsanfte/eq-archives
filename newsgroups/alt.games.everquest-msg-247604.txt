Nobody requires that other people have to communicate with you. For
all you know they don't even speak English or you are dealing with 7-9
year old children that don't know any better or have been told by
their parents *NOT* to communicate with anybody in the game via /tell.
There are simply way too many variables to assume that simply because
someone is not /tell'ing you that they are being rude. They did
absolutely 0 wrong given his story.
