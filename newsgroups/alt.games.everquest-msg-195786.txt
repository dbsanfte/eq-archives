LOL.  Yeh.  A lot of people forget about COBALT.  Unless you are a SUPER
UBER who has a guild doing planes raids to support you I think the COBALT
line of Armor is the best thing for a Warrior.  Only the Breastplate
requires a Planes raids.  Drops off of some 66th level dragon.  Most of the
other stuff is in the Castle that is located in the DreadLands.

And for something completely different, my immediate plans are to reach
level 45.  A guildmate of mine said that once I hit 45, they could take me
to GUK and get me a Haste belt.
