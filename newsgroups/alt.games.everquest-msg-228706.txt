Kobe sounds like a common computer tech... many of us have had various
nightmares from the compaq line of computers... But to be honest their
desktop products are not where there main issues are... it is with
their laptop line of computers.  The recent line of Compaq / HP
desktops have been running like a charm at my work place... (in excess
of 2000 pc's ).

I think you did fine Lance, let us know how it turns out.
