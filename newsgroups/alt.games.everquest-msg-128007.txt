Yes, but it shouldn't fully excuse it either.  After all, the games say
"playable online via battle.net" on the box, so they have *some*
obligation to fullfil that.  If it was down 1 tuesday every three months
that would be unreasonable to complain about.  But if it's down 75%
of the time, they really aren't meeting the feature they advertised.

Battle.net has gotten better though. From the early days of Diablo II,
up until somewhat recently, it was very bad on many occasions.  Many
hardcore characters were lost due to lag. Many nights you couldn't get
on at all, or could barely play.

Still, I'm a big Blizzard fan and can see they have done alot to improve
it. I think that they just totally underesitmated the number of people that
would play D2 online. It was a *far* bigger success than their previous
RTS games.
