That is correct.  Using /assist will actually transfer your target to
the mob, unlike targeting the player which will make you hit the mob,
but the player is still targeted.

You should be able to have a macro that does something like:
/assist %t
to make it easy on you.  I just manually change my macro to the tanks
name since I use it so much, and am assisting and not pulling.
