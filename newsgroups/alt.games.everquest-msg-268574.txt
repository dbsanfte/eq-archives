I have both.  This are my thoughts on WoW for what they are worth.

It is fun.  Being able to solo while waiting for a group is a huge 
thing IMO.  No zoning is also a very big plus.  Call me crazy but I 
like the look of the game/characters.

It bugs me that I set-up my keyboard to use the numberpad for spell 
casting and stuff, then at some point the game forgets that it saw the 
keys as numpad1, numpad2 and so on.  Instead it sees the numberpad 
keys as end, down arrow and so on.  This forces me to redo my keyboard 
binds so the numberpad will work.  I have bugged this a million times 
since beginning beta, but it is still there as of last night.

I don't like being stuck with the windows their way.  I want to be 
able to move them and size them to my liking, not just the chat 
windows, but every single window on the screen.

Is just a bit to linear feeling in the beginning. Well it feels that 
way all the way to 25 IMO, but maybe that is because I tried to do 
every single quest and they seem to lead you in a direct path without 
much of a random feel.

Personally, I think EQ2 and WoW are both good games and worthy of some 
play time.  Myself I like EQ2 better, but I have 3 friends that all 
live in the same town and work the same hours that hang-out in game 
with me.  This gives us enough of a group to do most anything since I 
am a Shadow Knight and my friends are Bard, Cleric and  Necromancer.
