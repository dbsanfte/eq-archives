I am convinced that it helps. I understand what you are saying about a run
of misses ending anyway, but so often I have found that not just runs of
misses but runs of low scoring hits have been broken by turning auto attack
off and on that I use it as a tactic.

I have two rogues out of about sixteen characters and, very early on, I was
persuaded by a high-level character that this was a useful tactic, to run
thru the mob, turn and backstab. I have managed to do it successfully but
very infrequently and it depends very much on the type of mob. I have found,
so far, that the crocs/caimen in Oasis can be handled like this but that's
about all. However, I would never consider my characters to be expert rogues
and I  am sure more competent ones would be able to employ this very
usefully.
