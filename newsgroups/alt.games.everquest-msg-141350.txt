Yes, let's creatively ignore the logs of the guild outright saying
that they knew what they were doing was an exploit and that they would
get banned if they were caught. There was a hell of a lot more to it
than "creative tactics". And, an exploit doesn't have to be a "sure
thing" to be bannable. An exploit is an exploit. Period. It is against
the rules, even if it's imperfect. They knew damn well they were
risking being banned for it, they shoulda sucked it up and taken the
consequences for their actions instead of whining like spoiled
children who just had their toys taken away.
