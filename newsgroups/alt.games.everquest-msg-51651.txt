Not if your guild wants to smack Renux around.  She drops a Jagged
Diamond Dagger 100% of the time, obviating the need to turn in
a BR/GZ/M2H/some other weapon as part of the side quest that
results in the JDD.

Same thing with the other side quests.  The one difference (and I
did the side quests with the robes simply because I already had
a Kedge robe and got the others in East Commons) is that the
rogue epic can partially be done alone if you can spend your
normal gaming time gathering the side-quests' components.  Say
as in spending your leveling-up time in the Magi room instead
of the Frenzy room.  Not quite "alone,"  but definately not
"gather 20 of your closest friends to take down the General in
Kithicor" either.
