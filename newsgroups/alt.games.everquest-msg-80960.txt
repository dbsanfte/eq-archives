Orc hill is the area just north of the "orc lift" (northernmost lift
of Kelethin), in between the lift and the entrance to Crushbone.
There are several orc camps there, plus wandering orcs.  You'll find a
few pawns (which would be green to you by now) but mostly centurions,
plus orc oracles and orc shamans.

I hear a lot of tank type players complain about casters running
around in circles when they start getting hit, making it hard for the
tank to taunt the mob off because they have to keep chasing the mob
around.  I think some casters need to learn to stay still for a few
seconds so the tank can more easily taunt the mob off. (they could
make a hot key to use the minute a mob is on them saying something
like "/g MOB ON ME!" or whatever, then stay still for a couple
seconds, and hopefully the tank will get the mob off).

Glad you're having fun, though! :-)
