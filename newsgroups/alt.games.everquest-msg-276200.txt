Why's that?  There's no such thing as a baby dragon?   Why
wouldn't they grow in power (and wealth, as displayed by
drops) over time?   EQ2 has a raid-level (2 group, level 24
IIRC) dragon in one of the tier2 zones.   At least you can
see the model fairly early...

EQ2 has several quests done as a group with equal rewards.
Admittedly you have to get them individually but they're
group quests, just each person has to hail & follow the
dialog for each.

EQ's a *great* game -- but I don't see a need to compare
it to newer ones.   It's definitely an older game -- with its
own charm that's not being copied by newer games.  Some
of the design differences are for the better;  some aren't.
