There's a back door but its one way....as well as the main entrance that
is two way if you go right down to the bottom and all the way along the
geonid tunnel then you reappear in a small hut just outside the orc fort.
Do it at the wrong time and you will appear with a psycho dwarf or an orc
emissary waiting to kill you so if you can zone invis thats a good idea
until you can handle those 2 together solo. You can't go back in that way
- at least not to my knowledge.
