Also keep in mind that those vertically challenged fellows (and their
merchants) are not on the general Shadowhaven faction (whatever it's
called). If you do the trade commissioner quest several times, you can
get up to amiable, warmly, etc. with the generic merchants, but the
members of the various clans (including Stout) will still be dubious to
you. You either need to do that stupid trade commisioner quest until you
are high Ally to get up to trade relations with the Stout folks, or do
some Stout specific quests which you can find in their sector.

I've been doing blacksmithing up on the moon, and I had to work on stout
faction to be able to get banded molds.
