That was Chorus of Replenishment, the level 58 AE manasong.  Each tick it 
gives 13 mana, and between 21 and 28hp, depending on which lute I'm 
holding.  It also adds STA regen.  With this one song high-level bards 
become much more effective for PL purposes.  I've sat in a newbie/lowbie 
area with this song playing and have watched smart players just kill huge 
numbers of mobs in a short time.  If I'm really feeling nice I throw in an 
AE slow/snare song too; it keeps the adds centered on me and reduces the 
damage done to the players also.

hmmmm, move the twink to a 2nd account, toss the fungi on him, and see 
what 50hp/tick regen can do
