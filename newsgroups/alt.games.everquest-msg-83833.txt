I'm afraid you've confused me, so I apologize ahead of time.

If you're just trying to set up the same config for your bard as your necro
when it comes to hotkeys & such, yes.

Assuming you've EVER logged in to both characters at least once, simply go
to your EQ folder and delete your 2nd char NAMED files and make a copy of
each of your 1st char NAMED files, then rename the 2nd set to match your 2nd
character.

You'll probably have to re-do your ABILITIES (such as /doability 1 being
Sense Heading), but that only takes a second.

A friend of mine has a high level cleric.  I needed her to log on MY higher
level cleric for a raid, and this is how she got my cleric set up very
quickly.
