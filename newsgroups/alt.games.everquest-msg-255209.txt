Moopy was a bit confused.  You choose to assume he meant "max background
FPS", when he specifically said "when you're not focused don't render 3d". 
I choose to assume he meant he liked exactly what he said he liked, "when
you're not focused don't render 3d" and he forgot and/or didn't know the
proper INI file variable name, or was simply confused about what was
providing what he liked, i.e., "when you're not focused don't render 3d". 

Nothing bad about Moopy, who cares what the INI variable names are if it
does what you want, eh?

That is indeed what I replied to.  That is indeed what you responded to. 
It's too bad that only one of us seems to have applied any logic in our
interpretation of the post.

I agree.  =P
