Thanks, I will check this site out.

Yeah, I looked in the places in Freeport where they were supposed to be and 
couldn't find them.  Maybe it's time to travel a bit.

I've looked here, she's got all sorts of weapon molds as you say, but no 
dagger blade.  I think I am doomed to not get this made.  Maybe when I 
travel to find the hilt I will find a dagger blade.

I've been able to gather all the other stuff I need.

Thanks for all the help. Now I need to go find my way to some of these new 
places to try to get the molds.
