Yes you can get them at a lower price with any faction or charisma improving gear or buff but why? 90% of the systems out there have
the horses/elemental models disabled to play. tboots are even faster than the lowest cost horse at almost half the pp and I can buy
a ton of SoW potions for the cost of the next level horses with none of the headaches involved with horses.
