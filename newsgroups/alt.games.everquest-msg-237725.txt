For precisely that reason I finally claimed my bag, just before
registering GoD. I didn't want to be in your position :)

For what its worth, I'm pretty sure it will only claim one gift at a
time. Which gift it claims first however... could be based on the
order you registered the expansions, or it could be hardwired ldon
then god or... god then ldon... its even possible it might give you a
choice when you type /claim...or just for completeness it could be a
reverse order of the order used to register the expansions. :p

I however, don't know which. But I am reasonably confident it doesn't
do both at once. There probably aren't that many in your predicament,
so your unlikely to get a positive response here.  You might try
petitioning first, but odds are the guides won't know. You could try
emailing your gm... they should be able to provide you the answer...
if they answer.
