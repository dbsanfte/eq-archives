Hmmm...so given a choice between this (dots represent grinding, B represents
bonuses, and G is the goal):

    ........B........B........B..G

and this

    ....B....B....B..............G

you might prefer the first, so that that the largest run of "."s is smaller?

That is basically the difference between splitting and always being at 100%
one or the other.  You reach goals at the same time, but splitting delays
the bonuses along the way, making it longer until you get your first bonus,
and longer between bonuses.
