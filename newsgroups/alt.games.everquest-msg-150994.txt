So eloquently put...you just no this is going to be a quality read.

Not actually tried playing as such but yes my Mule in the Bazaar locks up
after about 30mins It's a patch, Verant are generally pretty incompetent
when it comes to them and something always goes wrong...which is why I
awlays go out after a patch, if I can.

Thats good as they are all off solo'ing somewhere we need Druid healers to
make up for the lakc of grouping Clerics :ï¿½)

Other than Heal better than ANY class and outdamage all the plate wearing
classes (past 56) nothing, who'd want them?

I would think that anyone who quits over Clerics getting decent melee
capability at 56 or Druids/Shamans getting a better heal at 58 or Knight
Class getting Dual Wield needs to either grow up or by a console and play
with that.
All they tried to do was make the Druids more desirable in the End Game like
giving the Cleric some offensive capability so the class has at least some
versatility. They've nerfed no one they've just tried to fix some areas...I
expect they will do more for the Hybrid plate classes next and there'll be
the usual, collective /sigh from all us Warriors.
