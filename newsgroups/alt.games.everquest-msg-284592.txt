Hm, I should go back and get more data.  The one time I was trying to
figure this out, I used the characters then in my stable and found:

Level	Green	LtBlue	DkBlue
14	7	8-9	10
19	11	12-13	14
36	23	24-26	27
51	33	34-37	38
54	35	36-39	40
55	35	36-40	41

Except for level 8 vs level 14, this was consistent with the theory
that anything 3/4 your level, rounded down, was DB, and anything less
than that but at least 2/3 your level, rounded down, was LB.
