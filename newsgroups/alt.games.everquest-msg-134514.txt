Society will do plenty to say its "wrong".  By calling attention, as
you put it, to the diversity of people- both individuals and families-
kids learn to accept what is different and treat everyone fairly.
My mother-in-law could tell you more about this, it was a part of her
education in ECE (early childhood education) and part of her work as a
nanny.  She could tell you better than I that kids will inherit the
prejudices of society all on their own, but some early exposure to
"different is ok" helps to prevent that.  Guess this is one of those
"PC" things you don't get.
