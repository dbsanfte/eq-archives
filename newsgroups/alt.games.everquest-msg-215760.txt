Yes, these concepts are just as valid for a level 1 as for a level 65- only 
the scale changes, not the mechanics.

So does getting through the first 10 levels. Thus, money spent optimizing 
your character for those levels might be better spent on twinks that will 
scale nicely, rather than run out of steam.

Mana pool is important(mostly for emergencies or burst-intensive tactics 
like quadding), but not as important for sheer leveling power as mana 
regeneration.

The item I was referring to is one single piece of twinkage which will last 
you happily until level 45, and will have the same benefit throughout those 
45 levels. It will still be going strong long past the point where the 
rings will be replaced (to add int or mana), etc.

I have said it before and I will say it again- A mana preservation item 
will be the single best investment you could make in a twink caster.
