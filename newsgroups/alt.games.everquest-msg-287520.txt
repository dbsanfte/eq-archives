This was handled quite well in the early days of d&d, where items would lose 
enchantment the further they got from their own plane.
If you found some uber axe on the ninth plane of hell, when it comes back 
home its (say) 12 planes removed and loses most of its sting.

I guess you have to have the foresight when you make new content to make 
them "planes". Too late now.
