I don't know how this free version works, but when the UK server was
launched a lot of the gaming magazines had a month's trial on their
cover disks.  I think this restricted players to the origional regions
of Norrath, pre the Kunark release.  A friend of mine loaded it up & I
created a charachter on the server to give him a few pointers so there
was no question of this being a demo version of the game.

The version to which I referred earlier didn't require you to pay for
anything.  If you decided not to continue after 30 days your account
was disabled.

This won't be a trial version as such rather a trial period on live
servers.  I don't know if the server selection will be restrictive or
if you'll have access to all of them.  As your charachters are stored
on the servers at SoE rather than your local pc you will be able to
access them from anywhere.  In the version I am aware of at the end of
30 days you just needed to start paying to continue playing.  The
remainder of the zones were opened up by entering access codes once
you bought the software.

Basically yes - everything in the continents to which you have access.
 All the quests will be available, provided they don't require
components from distant lands.

I shouldn't worry about not having the 'Instruction Book'.  There is
very little information in it by comparison there is everything you
could ever need to know freely available on the internet.  There are
lots of general information sites (Allazhams, Everlore, Casters Realm)
as well as specialist ones (EQ Atlas, EQ Traders, lots of class
specific ones such as The Runes for enchanters).

The next expasion (Gates of Discord) is due out very shortly,
therefore I would imagine that all the previous ones will be avaialble
in a big box!

If you do decide to go ahead you'll encounter some of the idiots, its
inevertable, however the average age of your typical player is higher
than most other games so they tend to be fewer in number.  The bigger
problem tends to be people who have bought rather than learned thier
charachters & consequesntly can't play the game.

Good Luck & Safe Hunting.
