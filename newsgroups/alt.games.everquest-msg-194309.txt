Its not a snide comment.  Its a plea for detailed argument, a response to your
post in another thread where you said

 "Hmm, then why hasn't that been the case with your previous posts? You simply
dismiss anything anyone else says and then state you wanted something different
from the discourse than the person presented."

I'm saying the opposite of what you suggest here: not "I'm right and noone else
should post" but "here's my case and please rebut with details"

I'm also saying "failure to rebut will constitute presumed agreement"

Its a challenge, a gauntlet laid down in front of you.

How you could see it as a declaration that I plan to ignore any points you may
have is quite beyond me.

In point of fact, I plan to read your points carefully and attempt to figure out
where you agree with me and where you have some disagreement, determine whether
its well reasoned and supported by the facts, or whether there's a flaw in your
reasoning or facts that is causing the discrepancy.

If, for example, you said "Aha, but Regen 1 doesn't give just 10 hp per minute,
it gives 400 hp per minute" then you'd have an excellent counter to my thesis.
Of course that could be checked fairly easily and shown to be incorrect, but
perhaps there is something else I've stated that is wrong, or some fact I've
overlooked that is a powerful argument in favor of regen.

If you have some point to make, by all means make it.

Just saying I'm wrong isn't enough.  Just saying "regen is as good as run" isn't
enough.  Back it up, man!

If you can point to a post you've made where you've made a statement and backed
it up with reasoning and details, I'll be surprised.  If you can point to a post
where I've failed to do so (either in that post, or at least as a reply when
called on my statement) I'll also be reasonably surprised, although there are
times when I don't respond at all... which often means, as I suggest here, that
I've decided the person calling me wrong (and supplying reasoning and or factual
details) is right after all.

Hard to make that post that says "you are right and I am wrong", when it comes
down to it.  Sometimes I do it, but sometimes I don't.

Also, sometimes I miss a post, or skip answering one intending to come back to
it later but forget to do so.  So failure to respond isn't particularly
meaningful in most cases.  Here, I was attempting to make the challenge more
direct than usual, to see if I could get you to rise to the occasion, not just
by saying "no, you are wrong" but "and here's why"

Or agree and move on... but next time you disagree with me, or agree with me but
want to add a point I've missed, support your thesis.

Oh and I don't mean that its all about me, either; when you disagree or agree
with someone else, support your thesis there too.  Or when you start a new
thread, again, some support.   Can't learn anything from you, can't correct any
errors you've made (or try to do so, only to be shown wrong by your or someone
else's later reply), without some support.  Posts that simply make statements in
a vacuum are so much meaningless white noise cluttering up the newsgroups.
