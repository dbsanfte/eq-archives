I saw it get improved. Long ago, while they were preparing for the release
of kunark, they had mayong mistmoore in steamfont killing this little baby
dragon...people were just fucking around constantly, it was a nightmare.

After a while, Mayong did some kind of gravity flux thing. Instead of blow
people up, it flung them out. Limited range..people who were standing back
like they were asked were untouched, people a little closer in (like
myself) were flung, people closer in still took 2500 points of unresistable
damage...survivors of that were also flung.

It was highly cool...and the behavior of people improved dramatically.
