Only trouble is, first you need to do the Citizenship quest, which requires a
Vah Shir newbie item to start.  So non Vah Shir need a Vah Shir to hand in
their item to start, plus do a little running around till they get to the part
that can be MQ'd.  Then they are no longer able to become citizens themselves.
Usual solution is to create a thowaway character to do it with.  Firiona Vie
only allows one character per account, though, making that tricky.

One solution would be to start a Vah Shir, do the first part of the quest up to
the MQ, hand that in, quickly delete, make real character, run up to Shar Val
and do the second part of the MQ, hoping nobody does it in between and messes
you up.

Another solution unique to Firiona Vie occurs to me though.  Ask someone to
loan you their citizenship slate, its probably not No Drop, few things are on
FV.  Or loan you the special sewing kit or whatever the trade skill container
is that you need to do the quest with...  This sort of workaround doesn't come
naturally to those of us who grew up on "no drop" servers, but it comes in
handy sometimes on FV.  Get a trusted friend to loan you their Small Green
Drum, for example, and you have a mount until you go indoors or log out,
without spending 8kpp on the drum! (beware horse thieves, though)

Splendid
