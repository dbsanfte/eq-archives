My own theory is that they're the easier classes to level up.  No having to
wait for them to med, you can just thorn and buff 'em up and let 'em rip
while their Druid/Cleric/Shaman buddy meds to throw heals on them.  It's not
nearly as easy to PL a buddy that has to actually expend mana.

Thus, they enter the game knowing nothing, get leveled up to their buddy's
level, and *still* know nothing.

Or their guild needs a new tank, so they volunteer, get leveled up, and know
nothing.

Etc., etc.
