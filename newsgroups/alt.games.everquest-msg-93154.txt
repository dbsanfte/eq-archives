Bizbee,
Actually from what I have been told (being in middle management of the
Customer Service industry), the estimation of a cost for an employee being
approximately 2x the amount you give them in salary is very accurate. Your
figure of $20/hour equates out to $41,600 per year salary (assuming 40 hour
weeks). $41,000 is a low to mid-low salary rate for a computer center
customer service position. For many place, $40,000 is the introductory or
starting salary for them. So I highly doubt on average, a GM would be payed
less then $20/hour for his job.

Then you have to add in work place insurance, workers compensation,
health/dental/life/disability insurance, vacation time costs, equipment cost
for position/job fuction, training costs, educational benieft re-imbursement,
employee work incidentals (ie. tolite paper, water, pop, etc.), taxes, etc.
All of these items add up. What about those personal calls you make at work
that you are not suppose to? Who pays for that but the company you work for?
Email costs? It all adds up, and from everything my Human Resource Department
tells me, I can expect to have to buget for a employee at a rate of about 2x
what we want to pay him. Yes, I doubt we pay any difference between a $40k
per year person then we do from a $200k per year person for health insurance
as a company. But I do believe that vacation time cost of the $40k per year
person is substantially less then the $200k per year person in return.

In this part, I think we are all mostly in an agreement. The orginial posted
is crying because he/she is not receiving the money made from an obvious
market place being tapped by a company in the business to make a profit for
itself and its employees by providing something that some people out there
ARE willing to pay for. If someone was going to pay them $40 per month for
something, they would be stupid to not take it.
