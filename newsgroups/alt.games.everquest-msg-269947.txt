Uh, you have to start from the beginning anyway.  You can't
start at level 20...   And you have FOUR slots -- that means
you can twink, at least within the game's limits.  The ONLY
impact it has is you can't leave alts sitting all over the place;
there's a "cost" associated with abandoning a character.
I don't have a lot of problem with that -- I deleted chars in
EQ1 once I decided I didn't care for the race/class too.

*shrug*  Me either.  But I think the argument "you can't enjoy
the game without more slots" is nonsense.

If anything, I'd say the decision to let you have more slots
if you pay more is a bad business decision -- they should
have kept it at four until they got the game running as is.
Now some tradeskillers won't have the forced interaction
they were looking for, the economy will be distorted by
more twinking, etc.   I'd have let it run as is for a while,
then let everyone have more slots when Frogloks were
unlocked, and not charged for it.
