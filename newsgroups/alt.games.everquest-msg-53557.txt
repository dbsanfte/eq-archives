I assume noone is griping about unintentional inspects.  At most,
apologize, in a truely crowded spot, don't even bother with that,
click it off immediately and its pretty clear the person got no
information about your gear anyway.

I'll tell you, the person I'm least likely to buff is the person who wants
it "for a CR."  Perhaps its all this time spent playing a cleric, but
dead people rarely need a SOW to get to their bodies.  Either it
won't help at all, or else its not necessary; most bodies lie out
of aggro range of stationary mobs, since most people don't
wade into range, then fight and die where they stand.  To me,
"SOW for CR" means "I've found that this claim gets more
sympathy than 'I want to hunt stuff solo using your character
to PL me but without giving him any of the exp or loot'"

Even if I'm clearly too high level to group with the guy, I'm
screwing a lower level SoWer out of part of what should
make him in demand for a group.  Not that I mind doing so,
but the "for a CR" crowd are attempting to make that choice
for me.

I've been non anon, non roleplay for 101 levels as a cleric (49 levels
first time, 52 second) and 25 levels as a druid, and I've not had any
trouble with this phenomenum.  I think I've had about six people ask
me to come SOW them... which is silly, why would I want to do that?
True, if my cleric goes into Oasis he gets a few buff beggers, but I don't
spend much time around lowbie zones.

Does SOS last across zone lines?  If so, yes, great solution, although
it still lets the people who meant "I want SOW to run across several zones
to get to my hunting grounds in half the time, but I'm too cheap to
offer a plat" get one over on you.  It is significantly faster than SOW,
though,
so it would be -better- for the nominal purpose of running to, grabbing, and

dragging your body out to a zone line.

This POS book I have lists SOS as (53) druid.  Inaccurate again?
