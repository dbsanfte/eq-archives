May I recommend Steven Brust, and his series of books about Vlad
Taltos.... Just love this series.  is about 7 - 8 books but they are
not the typical 90000 pages, each one is rather thin, and can hold up
pretty much on their own or read as a series.
Another of My favorites is Margret Weis and Tracy Hickmans Deathgate
cycle.  its about 7 books and all need to be read in sequence but I
had the hardest time putting this down, and when I originaly read it
it was still being released and the wait for the next book was killing
me.
