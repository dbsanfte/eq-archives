This is a site with all the known EQ easter eggs. For the one you're
wondering about:

"Making your way to the Plane of Growth, you may find Prince Thirneg - but
beware of telling him what you came for... If you tell him, "I have come
here for phat lewts" he says that you will find no "Phat Lewts" here, and
slays you instantly. Methinks the programmers got tired of leet-dood
lewt-hunters."

and here's a link to verify:
