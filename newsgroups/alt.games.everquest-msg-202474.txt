First of all thanks to everyone who helped me with my Sense Heading thread.  I 
got SH mapped to my right and left arrow keys and within a couple hours of 
play I had it up to 52.

Now I notice I've got a Slam ability for my Barbarian Shaman.  I hotkeyed it 
and it helps a little during a fight.  My question is whether this skill gets 
better or if it will always be as effective as it is now?  It doesn't seem to 
do much damage and although I try to use it a lot it has never progressed.  I 
don't have a listing at my trainer to put a training point in it.
