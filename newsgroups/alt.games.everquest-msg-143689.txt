SK's get plate/more hp/more ac.. we get stonestance.

Btw stop giving VI more messed up ideas!! :(

Well in long boring exp camps it comes in handy...  e.g camping shards, or
ssra commanders - where you have the same group for many many many hours
(and no deaths).. its still nice for the early clearing on a raid, or
passing time till until enough people show up to kill the "boss"

It's still nice

Isnt the HoT skill a shitty long refresh too?   Once you have the skill it
should be 1minute recast or so, not 72...

Yeah utterly useless, but I had to add that 1 in :)

Oh please.  The only one you listed above thats worth a damn is ambidex, and
warriors, rogues, rangers all get it too.

Id guess that most people pick regen 3 over first aid 3 (I'm an exception
with most people I talk to). And whilst critical mend is ok.. the chance of
it firing is too low for it to be anywhere near worthwhile.

I let myself get low on HP in the off chance crit mend will fire, and more
often than not it doesn't... which means I waited longer to use mend (so
have to wait longer to re-use it again).. which means its less useful
really.

Warriors get rampage and flurry, AE taunt.. at least 3 unique things.  We
get FD3, which is nice for pulling, but i want something fun too, you know?
It's not like I haven't worked for them..

Whats the average hit on a 1h weapon...shrug..  at a guess id say around
50.. so something thats more than double a regular hit.. yeah, thats still
pretty awesome for rogues.  Not to mention the all famous(tm) "punch for 1"
