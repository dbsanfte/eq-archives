i love this post....

lance, if it's possibly, could you do an analysis like this for OS?

i always felt OS was the great cash spot

dont die, kill the runners...

loot everything but destroy silver and copper...

and deduct the cost of a KEI and/or virtue, because you dont want to have a
lot of downtime*

would be awesome, i'm very curious

~fennin.faza~

*= i don't know how cautious you would be there, so i don't know how much
damage you would take, how fast you would dish it out, etc etc
