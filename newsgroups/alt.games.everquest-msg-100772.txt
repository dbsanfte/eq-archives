I will agree with you on that. 

Someone poste a while ago that when they added the AA levels all the
60's  came out the wood work and pretty much took over all the spots
again.  People level 55+ are pretty much pushed out.

introduce a totally new concept that pulls the super players away for
an extened peoriod of time.
