And who's going to store this data, back it up, move it to new media, et
cetera?  The US copyright expiry is 95 years, so this data will have to be
protected and regularly updated for that long.  Further, they'd need to keep
archives of all of the compilers, chip schematics, firmware, and other
drivers.

In other words, no point to it.

What *really* should be done is that copyright for software should be
reduced to, say, 5 to 10 years.  Keep in mind that this doesn't affect EQ,
as the copyright gets renewed each year as they patch and expand, but once
they shut it down, then they've no reason to keep renewing the copyright.  5
years later, people might still be able to play it on their older machines.
