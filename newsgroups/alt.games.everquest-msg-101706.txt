  The guards at the opening to the tunnel that leads to the Warrens are very
very low in level so it's possible that's the reason they didn't attack
you... also, if you run near the middle, so you're equally distanced from
them both, I think you might fall outside their aggro range.  Finally, mobs
don't always react immediately to someone who is KOS to them... there's
sometimes a delay of a few seconds before a mob aggros on you... this is why
sometimes, especially if you have SoW, you can run right by a KOS mob and
not get aggro'd on.  I'm almost certain that a dark elf mage of any religion
would be KOS to the Paineel guards (to begin with) but I could be wrong.

  And you're right that killing kobolds in Toxxulia improves your faction
with the Paineel and Erudin guards.  :)
