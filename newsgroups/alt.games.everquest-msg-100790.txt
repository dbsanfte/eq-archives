Hmmm...

�29.99 for EQ
�19.99 for Kunark
�19.99 for Velious
�19.99 for Luclin
�18.25-ish every 3 months (12th payment just went thru... call it �220
total)

nearly �340 UK... about US$470 in software and subscriptions spread over
nearly 3 years

�80 for a new soundcard when my old one failed the DX7 test (my only
EQ-driven hardware upgrade)
maybe another �30 for printing and stationary for maps, quest notes and
tradeskill recipes...

EQ has cost me about �2/$3 a week for 2 years... not bad :o)
