I doubt SOE reads usenet.  You're right, I should have posted details to 
forums, but honestly, I was so shocked at their actions that I did 
nothing.  The GM I demonstrated it to was shocked that I had been 
suspended as well.

And no, it took some time to reproduce the bug so that I could do it 
consistently.  But I also didn't profit off of it, either.  The bug was 
a method of duping a stack of items, and it took some time to figure out 
how to get it to happen on demand.  I was using stacks of summoned food, 
but I could just as easily been using blue diamonds.

After I figured it out, I used it once more to show the GM.  He had me 
do several dups, using specific GM items, so that he could verify the bug.
