This doesn't count as the biggest or the best, but it was a lot of fun for
me.  I started a new gnome magic user and he is just so darn cute.  Well the
little guy managed to make it to 4th level and he's pretty fast.  The other
day someone gave him a SOW and boy he can just run like lightning with that
thing.  He's been hangin out in Kelethin so I ran him on out to Orc Hill.
He grabbed a coupla Orcs and started running.  He was just a little yellow
streak.  I ran right for any Orc I could find and before long had about 8 on
my tail.  When I finally got to the lift, they were so far behind I had time
to go up the lift, drink an ale and head back down to watch the slaughter
(hehe only kidding) but they were a long way off.

Not a big train, but pretty impressive for a little guy!

Can't catch me I'm the Gingerbread Man-Wheeeeee!
