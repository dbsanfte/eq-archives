Strangely enough I personally dislike using KEI routinely....
a) My main isnt a rich character, and coughing up the cost of it each time
would rapidly drain my funds (also I got tired of dealing with assholes 
the first time a while back when I had 6 plat in the bank and got a KEI'er
offering 'donations and free for poor folk', gave him a block of acrylia
as a donation to have the guy have a right go at me along the lines of
'you are level 40 you cant be that poor' - I felt my only saleable 
item was a reasonable donation given the price of them in the bazaar and
I did only have 6 plat in liquid cash)
b) the downtime of going to get the buff is often enough that I feel Im
losing out, either on a camp or a good run of xp.
c) As a ranger fear kiting all too often is efficient enough that the
spell is unneeded anyway (stonebrunt my friends)
d) I dislike being dependant on outside assistance like that routinely as
when it runs out I can be left in a bit of a fix. (Note that Im not
worried about it making hunting to easy and losing skill that way - I fear
kite after all and that is a gimps job)
e) I can hunt areas where I have less competition as all the KEi crack
nuts are off in higher level zones.... 

I use it if we go on a raid and the RL or organiser suggests or asks for
all to be carrying it, or if the guild chanter puts it about - to that
extent I will be sorry to see it go or be nerfed if the rumour is true.
But I wont miss it myself - I can lay odds our guild's clerics will miss
it more than me, so I do wonder how much this is a class based thing.
