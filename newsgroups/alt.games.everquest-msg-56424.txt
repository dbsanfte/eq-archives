So, adding even more options is bad how, exactly?

We all get that you don't like the MPC concept, but I've yet to see
you post any rational arguments about how it's bad. Instead you just
keep ranting that it is bad.

If all you're trying to get across is that you don't like it, well, we
know that now, so shut up already. If you want to debate about *why*
you think it's bad, by all means post some actual reasons.

So is playing RPGs.
