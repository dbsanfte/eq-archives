What a ludicrous statement.  You're paying them to provide you
EQ, which they do.  What they do with their profits is their
business, not yours.  The money in their pockets is theirs, not
yours.  If you don't think you're getting your money's worth
out of EQ, then quit spending money to play EQ.  Once you've
paid them that money it isn't yours anymore. You are no more
entitled to dictate how SOE spends their money than they are
entitled to dictate how you spend yours.
