It was a really bizzarre thing to try and introduce to the story. One
thing to pull something like that in a private P'n'P game, quite
another to try and pull that crap in a persistent online world with
established lore and expected settings. People played EQ to be in a
fantasy early medeival setting, not StarGate in the 12th Century. The
damage is done, the Goa'uld have been introduced, they will forever
haunt the EQ landscape.

Not that aliens are a foreign concept to EQ (or EQ2). But previously
they were passive observers, sometimes benevolent helpers. Rodcet Nife
has that flying saucer the Paladins use as an HQ in Qeynos. I remember
someone mentioning EQ2 continues that line with some starship logs and
solar system holomaps in some obscure corner. Alien invaders, clearly
advanced enough to traverse worlds almost at will, would neccessarily
trounce any world of Norraths technology/magic levels. It was a silly
idea poorly executed.

I think PoR tries to go back more towards bringing the Gods back into
play, introducing new planes and the newly ascended Mayong Mistmoor who
has twisted some plane or other (Music, I think?) to his own purpose.
Which I would imagine has grabbed the attention of the gods.
