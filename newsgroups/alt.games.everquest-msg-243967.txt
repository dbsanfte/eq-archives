Wow, I'm an uber endgame player because I have FT15?  Anybody can get 
there, it just requires spending time in the right places.  You can get at 
least FT7 from LDoN alone, I am pretty sure even a couple more than that.  
With some cash, you can purchase a few more points of FT in the bazaar.  
Depending on your class, attending pickup raids on the right mobs will get 
you more.

I have two FT2 items (neck and face) off of Itraer Vius, FT2 boots from 
turning in King Tormax's head, FT2 cap from Lightning boss in BoT, FT2 
Ornate bracer I bought, FT3 from the Runed Coldain Prayer Shael, FT1 from 
the earring of the solstice, and an FT1 augment from LDoN.
