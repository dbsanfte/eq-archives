I'll leave out the first part of your response, since you seem to be
saying the same thing I am, but arguing that you aren't with some bazaar
wording. Let's just look at the last paragraph.

So you agree that the two items I'm talking about do not require the
installation and activation of PoP (be it through installation via CD or
download) for people to use them. And you agree that they are extorting
money by charging for features that have nothing to do with the new
zones and content that I would fully expect to pay for in any new
expansion. Good.

Ok. Fair enough. Let's call it, "justifying their actions which you
already called extortion and supporting them in doing it." rather than
ass kissing. Better?

Not only *should* it be available. It already *IS* (or was until they
put in more lockout coding) available to everyone. And would benefit
everyone, even if they never set foot in a single PoP zone. 

Your examples of the bazaar code, for instance, are just silly since
they only work in a zone that came with the last expansion. The code on
your machine is useless unless you go there.

The issue of the hijacking on the spells you never answered, and I can
rightly see why. I already cast one of those no drop spells in Antonica
last night. Worked just fine.
