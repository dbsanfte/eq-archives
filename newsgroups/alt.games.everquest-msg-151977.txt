I knew there would be one person who'd flame me.

As it happens Moria is one of my favourite games all time games,
Championship Manager is another. I'm far from graphically obsessed.

If it was all about the graphics, I wouldn't even have considered it.
However when the graphics make me motion sick then it's fair to say
it's a problem.

NWN has a good multiplayer (not massively multiplayer or persistent
world) framework and good graphics.
