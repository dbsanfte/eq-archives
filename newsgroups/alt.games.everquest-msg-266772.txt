"I believe everyody in the world should have guns. Citizens should have
bazookas and rocket launchers too. I believe that all citizens should have
their weapons of choice. However, I also believe that only I should have
the ammunition. Because frankly, I wouldn't trust the rest of the goobers
with anything more dangerous than string."
