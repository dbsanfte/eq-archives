OK  a great idea I read here is to use a community oven, forge, sewing kit,
or potters wheel. The stuff you put in them will not degrade like things
left on the ground and other characters passing by will not see your items
laying around. Unfortunately this would not work for a fanny-pack, as you
cannot place containers  in containers, but it is a great way to exchange
other items.
