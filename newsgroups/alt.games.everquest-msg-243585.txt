It consistently claims a connect of 230.4kbps... so consistently I
can't help thinking its lying.  40-60 would still be no slower than my
"56k" modem which normally connects at around 40 or 44kbps

Yep, I'm on Express Network, as I say above.  Unlimited usage all the
time, or just during my normal unlimited (voice) times?  Wife says
49.99 plan if that means anything, although since we have two phones
thats not what we actually pay.

Well, I do have an ISP, but I don't remember telling express network
about it.  I'm getting my email and the web, but haven't managed to
get newsgroups, I'm accessing this thru Google groups.  I'm not sure
what that means... maybe you can channel your other half again and see
if he has a clue.

Of course right after my original post I packed up the computer, moved
to Texas, and took till now to actually get online again, so I haven't
pursued this any further yet.

Dallas/Fort Worth (according to an artical in the local newpaper) has
the best wireless hub access in the country... but I don't have any
idea what it would take to get connected to that, if it's hardware
it's probably not happening in the next couple months, as all the
income this time of year is from my wife's business, no sword selling
till August

Thanks for the info, see above for more clarifications, now that I'm
back again I'll try some more... weekend coming up so I should be able
to screw around with this for the next couple days.
