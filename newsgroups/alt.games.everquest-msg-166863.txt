Forgot to add this ...

I can gain another five mana regen per tick via Mental Clarity (three) and
the Improved Familiar. So as the cap for mana regen (at level 60) is
restricted to 15, there's absolutely no point in me using AA's for this
*bonus* at all.

From the formula you've given me, the fastest time I can regain my full 4K
mana pool from zero would be to wear KEI and cast Harvest. Therefore.
(4000/43)/10 giving me a nine minute fifteen second downtime. All those AA
points aren't worth investing in mana regen.

Thanks again Tim ..


Stevie.
