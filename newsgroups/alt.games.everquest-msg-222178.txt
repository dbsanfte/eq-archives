That seems SO obvious to me that it just boggles me that anyone could not
see it.  If you kill 3 mobs at a time then it takes you 3x as long to do it.
So each one of those mobs gets to do 3x as much damage to you so the cleric
has to heal 3x as much for 3x the mana and there is 3x as much risk that
things might get out of control.  The only thing to be said in favor of
fighting 3 at once is that you can apply the same dot 3x, but I think in
most cases that is a minor factor.
