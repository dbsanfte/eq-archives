Drop off random mobs in zone it seems, and quite rare.  In two hours
of hunting in SF, total reported drops in a population that soared
up to 36, One.  Yep, One.  Dropped off a normal drake, no drop
item.  At least it isn't no rent.

Yep, I've been soloing and small grouping in SF for a couple months now,
its a nice zone, with dark blue mobs for anyone from 50 to 60, depending on
where you fight, some named that drop some epic parts, a number of
spell drops, decent exp, port for pickup from both wiz and druid... whats
not to like?  Other than the fact that the zone is about to become more
crowded than the Bazaar that is.
