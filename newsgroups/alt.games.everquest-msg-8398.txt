>> 1. Never group with a Cleric who melees.

Or a Druid that wants to be a Wizard

>I don't mind if its easy fights and the cleric is FM.

Agreed.

>> 2. Never respond to tells from people you don't know that do not EXPLICITLY
>> describe their request.

And if they change their minds and/or start adding things once you get
there, leave. "Could you port me to WK". Shortly followed by (once you
get there to pick them up): "Could you show me how to get to Halas?"

>> 3. Never respond to tells from people that call you Dude, Bro, or Bud
>
>Only if the tell is stupid. The terms themselves are not that bad.

Thankfully, once you get past a certain level the real twits start
being in such awe of your uberness (from their perspective) that they
hesitate to bother you. Mind you, this might not happen until you are
50+ depending on the idiot in question.

Warn them first in case they did not realize how offensive the action
was. Leave them only if they *still* do not realize what they did was
wrong after you warn them.

>> 5. Never speak to beggars

>All I say is 'no sorry' then I ignore them, otherwise they keep sending

I just say something like: "Busy" and keep on moving. Eventually they
drop off and look elsewhere.

>> 6. Never camp for an item you can't use, unless no one else is around.
>
>My rule is: I never camp. =)

Always surrender the camp to someone who can get exp off what you are
killing.

>> 7. Never twink your alt before your groupmate

Agreed, and especially on Raids. People who are actually THERE should
get precedence over alternates and guildmates who are not.

>> 8. Roleplay until you're sure no one else is. Don't ruin their experience.

>> 9. Be courteous to everyone at all times.

Would be nice if this went without saying.

>> 10. Give unwanted items to newbies that are making an effort to do it for
>> themselves.

But only if the item is below a certain level of power. Handing a
Shiny Metallic Robe that you no longer need to a newbie Enchanter is
just wrong somehow.

>11. Never join a pick-up plane raid.

Unless you know for a fact that the people running it really are
competent. There should be a collary to this entry: If you *do* go on
a raid stick with it until the corpses have been recovered at the very
least. If the idiot still want to press on, argue with them a little
bit and then feign severe fatigue or RL events interfering and Gate
home.

>12. Never fight AT the zone unless you are the only party
>in the zone. If you stand on the train tracks you are likely to
>get run over by a train.

This is also being nice to others who might be coming into the zone at
any moment. There is nothing quite like zoning into a free-for-all
that the PCs are losing.

>13. Never fight over spawns, if its crowded or camped, move on, plenty
>of places to hunt without the aggravation, effort or time wasted fighting
>over critters in a freaking game.

But never surrender the camp without argument if they move in without
warning or any attempt at being polite.

>14. Never leave a group member after they went linkdead in

O yes. From personal experience I can say that coming back from LD
some distance into Paw and not having your group still there is NOT a
fun time. Thank deity for invisibility and Gate spells is al I have to
say (I was the group Evac at the time).

>15. Never leave a group when a corpse of one of the group is still yet to
>be found or retrieved.

Finding that last one inside a wall is always fun too.

>16. When turning in items for a quest ALWAYS triple check to make
>sure you have everything required, your faction is good enough and
>you have the right NPC. "Oh I'm sorry I wanted a star ruby not a ruby" "DOH!"

Always, always, ALWAYS check the websites for info on your particular
quest if you can. If you feel really paranoid get hardcopy printout of
the entry and keep it near you while playing. I fully intend to do
this when I start my Epic.

>17. Always try to have fun and remember its a game. If I am yelling

Always look up other people in the game that you know in RL. I know a
fair chunk of my guild in RL. Makes for some fun guildchat...
