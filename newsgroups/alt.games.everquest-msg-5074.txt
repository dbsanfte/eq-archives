Probably one of the very best sword for the amount of risk you have to
undertake is the lamentation (9/19) 1HS.  It's the rare off the
sebilite guardian in Sebilis--he's typically part of the "B2" camp.

Seb is generally a level 50+ zone.  To get into it, you have to first
kill two level 45 frogs and complete a quest for the key to the zone.
