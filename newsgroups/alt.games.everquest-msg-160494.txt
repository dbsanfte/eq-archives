My friend at work has a Pentium 350 with 256 of Ram and a 64MB G-Force on a
DSL connection and he plays all the expansions except PoP without any
problems.  He's been playing for about 2 1/2 years and we have played
together many times.  I play on a Pentium 900 with 256 of RAM and a G-Force2
(only 32MB!) on a cable connection (networked with my wife's 1.2 machine)
and other than beating his pants off zoning threes no difference.  Load up
the Trilogy for her (I use 8.1 on my 32MB video card) and let her become as
addicted as the rest of us... why should she be allowed to have a life? lol
I just love PL'ing true newbees... spend better than 50% of my time playing
now a days doing just that, and giving them high dollar gear and plat.  You
know what they say... misery loves company!  hehehehehe
