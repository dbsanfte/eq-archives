Also interesting are the prices some folks are asking for ordinary
items.  Yesterday there was a guy offering a Gnoll Hide Lariat for
10,000pp.  Yes, that's right - 10,000!  These things usually go for
about 10pp.   He was afk so I couldn't ask him about it.  ;-)

Then there was the guy selling lightstones for 25pp each.

Weirdness.
