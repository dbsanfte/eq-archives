Aggro kiting is an artifact of observing how mobs behave, and using that 
in a sensible way.

It has to be possible to annoy a mob so much that he'll drop his attempt 
to kill the tank and come after that caster instead; if not, half the 
classes in the game would be completely safe from harm.

So a mechanism is in place that allows a mob to decide he -has- to kill 
that annoying SOB over there, even though something is whacking on him.

Since proximity aggro means that with equal annoyance factor, the closer 
PC gets to be IT, aggro kiting means that the kiter has to be very very 
annoying indeed in order to kite with melee.

Not really; fear kiting, root killing, and aggro kiting all involve the 
same "mob isnt' hitting anyone" idea.

If the mob would always go after someone in melee range, then the whole 
game would become lame.

I guess you could put in a timer, and say that the longer a mob has been 
chasing someone without hitting anything at all, the more likely he'd be 
to turn on the fleas biting him in the ass...

In which case your distaste for this particular "low risk" plan is even 
harder to fathom.  Its certainly not zero risk, because the kiter can 
lose aggro, and the mob can catch up to the kiter... and usually this 
tactic is employed in groups which can't actually stand toe to toe with 
the mob... and the kiter almost certainly can't.  Near zero... well, 
you've already admitted to being ok with that.
