Hey now, I didn't say I was in the uber ultra crowd!  I said such a crowd does
exist.  My only shaman is level 10 (he's almost a day old but spent quite a long
time chain casting spells and medding, too cheap to buy a KEI) so my major class
of experience here is the one I'm arguing -isn't- necessary for ultra optimal
play, the lowly cleric.

And I did say Paladin or SK as MA, which you seem to agree with.

Haste on demand is fine though.  What it isn't is "haste during incoming."  If the
shaman is the slower and healer, then on incoming he's slowing and healing.  Not
hasting.  Not buffing your dex.  Not out walking the dog-dog.  Slowing, healing.
Anything else is back burner.

Likewise you won't see my cleric dropping BOR on casters with a mob or two
entering camp. Wizard BOR dropped? Too bad, you'll have to wait till we aren't in
immanent wipe mode.  Get the mob situation to where MA hit points aren't dropping
faster than I can handle and I'll see if I have time to spare to cast your buff.
While Haste is certainly more important to the kill rate than BOR, it seems like
the same sort of thing to me; on the "to do" list but not the "right now" list.

Forssaken, 10 shaman
slapping my 10% slow on every mob that moves!
