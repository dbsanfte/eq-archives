Oh, please.

I hardly said it was my only tactic- just one I like when soloing or paired 
witha  rogue.

My tactics change with any variety of variables- the size of my group, the 
classes I am grouped with, the mobs I am fighting, the buffs I have on me, 
and my role in a group. I kite the regular way pretty well, I porcupine, 
and as soon as I get a nice AE spell to make it work, I'll be quad kiting.

I did not choose to play a Druid because I wanted a one-tactic character- I 
got quite enough of that leveling a mage to 15. I play a druid because they 
are flexible and give me a large variety of strategic options.
