I have taken the liberty of ((enclosing)) the really important ones, IME.

Fighter Classes - ((STR, DEX)), STA, AGI, (((AC)))
Priest Classes - STA, AGI, ((AC))
Pure Casters - STA, AGI, ((AC))
Everyone - (( SoW ))

Also, when buffing, do not try to buff everyone with all buffs right-this-
second. Cast a round of buffs (starting with yourself first), then 
meditate. In a minute or two, cast the next round. This way minimizes the 
chance that ALL buffs will wear out at the same time. As for casting on 
yourself first, the reason to do so is to have a timer for when everyone 
elses buffs run out- yours will start to blink first, and you should be 
able to get everyone buffed again in short order.
