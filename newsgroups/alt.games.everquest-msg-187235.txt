From the shadows, the mysterious Stormguide@hotmail.com (Horus) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

I've only ever heard of one, and it doesn't seem particularly likely
it will ever happen again. It's just too long a process to redo
everything now. The excuse (I'm told) they gave doesn't hold much
water right now - that the equipment on Test is substantially better
vs character level than other servers. It IS slightly better, but not
significantly, and most of it comes from the fact the economy is
ultradepressed (40 traders in bazaar is normal, and a cocw is
currently sitting there unsold for days at 15kpp) but pp still comes
in just as fast as on a regular server, so everyone can afford more.

Of course, if they suddenly decide they don't want anyone playing on
test ever again they could do some drastic things. I don't think the
server would survive another wipe, though.
