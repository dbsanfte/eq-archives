Playerauctions / Yantis are hardly low profile (didnt Yantis have a stand or
something at fan faire?).

If they cared, they would of done something about it by now.

A player recentley ebayed on our server (VS), people found out, informed the
GM's, the account is now deactiveated, according to the GM.  The guy already
got his cash (from PA I guess), whether it had already been sold I dont
know.

Ya, ebayers suck, but SoE will never take the matter to court IMO.
