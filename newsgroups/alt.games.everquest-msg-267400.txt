Killfiling is an individual decision, you can plonk anyone you like, and 
tell them about it or not as you wish.

I was merely answering the question, "what happens when"...

Of course, if you were wondering, I'm on that list of "idiots" who think 
it makes a difference, as you could easily verify by using google to 
search for instances of my name and the words "top posting".  Plonk away 
if you like.
