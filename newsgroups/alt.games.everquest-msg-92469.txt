Those peridot Symbols are the best HP buff out there
and can make the difference between training out of a
nice camp (at best) and a nice, long CR (at worst.)
They also make CHeals much more efficient, of course,
and that can make the difference between being able
to make constant pulls (and keeping a camp broke and
XP rolling in) and having to pause, re-break a camp,
and less XP over time.

Some camps don't need them, of course, but a lot of
them do, especially if you're not sure of the tank's
AC/HP, the enchanter's abilities, or even the groups
in nearby camps, all likely in a lot of pickup groups.

Even in camps that don't *need* them, I always have
one on me, the enchanter, and the main tank to start.
If I can keep mana without needing the extra efficiency,
I'll let it drop on the main tank and me.  I've never
grouped with an enchanter in an XP camp that I didn't
Symbol:  they keep me alive; I do my best to return the
favor.

That said, they're wasted on people who shouldn't be
getting aggro and I don't even waste the mana for lesser
Symbols for them.  And it's important to remember that
clerics routinely group with people several levels above
them after they get CHeal.   A 39 cleric, for instance,
can heal a 60 tank from unconscious to full health as
well as a 58 cleric, after all.  For clerics grouping "above
their level," mana efficiency is key.
