For low levels, a nasty one is in the underwater tunnels in the bear caves
in Surefall Glade.  My first level 2 character took a swim there, reached
the halfway point on air, and decided to go on, hoping to reach the other
end, and drowned.  I then tried getting the corpse by swimming back to it,
maddly trying to summon it, and turning around as soon as I got in summoning
range.  Each iteration of this was another death from drowning, but does
move the corpse a little.

After a few more iterations, I decided to try another approach, and went
into the caves and tried jumping into the water in various location, and
eventually found an entrance to the tunnels that was closer to the
corpse--close enough to reach the corpse on half my air.
