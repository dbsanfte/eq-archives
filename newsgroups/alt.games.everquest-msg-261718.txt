That is exactly my experience with the 128MB Radeon 9800 Pro.  Keep 
shadows off, you can run with everything else on with no issues as far as 
framerate.

Like Martin, I am running mine in a system with an AMD XP 3200+, 1GB of 
DDR400 memory.  Previously I had an FX5200 in the same system, and, it 
ran OK, but the ATI is much better.
