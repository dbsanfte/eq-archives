I started over as well - two tankers now:

an Laoch is a magic/Inv/SS tanker (Lv 5) and The Orang
is a Science/FA/SS tanker (Lv 6)

BTW - On the names:  Many years ago (81 or 82) when I was
in high school I had bright red, very long and thick hair(*). 
One of my friends decided I was, in fact, and orangutan 
passing as a man - and it stuck.  For the last 23 years I
have received inumerable ape birthday cards and a variety
of ape knick-knacks.  My personal email is the_real_orang
at yahoo dot com, and my domain (not yet redirected to my
server at home, work in progress) is theorangsden.com.

The Orang was taken from his home in Borneo, experimented
on by scientists in Paragon city, then underwent a meta-
morphisis (sp?) when the Rikti burned the place down.  

an Laoch is much easier - it simply means "the Hero" or
"the Champion" in Gaelic.  He's the descendent of a long
line of Celtic heros who get their powers through a series
of ancient rites :)

(*) now white at the temples,  very short and thinning on
top <sigh>

an Laoch, 5th Level Tanker (Magic/Inv/SS)
