Savior has no power cost and casts instantly, but is only castable every 900 
seconds (15 minutes). And I was wrong about the 30 seconds, it's 60 seconds 
duration and it's not guaranteed to go off. The App IV version has a 40% 
chance to go off when cast. I upgraded tonight to Adept 1, which has a 50% 
chance. I understand the Adept III version has a 60% chance.
