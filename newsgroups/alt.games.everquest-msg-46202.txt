    Sonic Bats are popping up everystinkingwhere.  What gives?  I saw a late
50's Shaman who solo's Frenzy regularly eat it this morning from the ensuing
green swarm.  Why?  Because from the beginning of Guk-itself bats saw undead
but they were back in BFE!  You either made it past those TWO and went on
with life or you had to deal with them there.  Not so this morning.  Why?!

    Example: I'm kos to lives.  I invis and go down the right ramp toward BR
and stop.  No roamers.  I IVU and head in at full speed as usual.  Then the
above death happens right in front of me in the waterway.  The bat sees me,
aggros a few frogs nearby and I gate.
    I come back, repeat the same thing.  This time, I kill both bats, re-IVU
and drop down....only to be seen by a Wan Ghoul KNIGHT?!  I gate again.
This time I take no chances.  I'm a mage.  The only pure-caster class who
has not been blessed with IVU so I strong-arm it (I'm _n-o-t_ complaining.
Wizards got the shaft for too long).  I roll over everything from top, br,
bats, gibs, 2-spawn, and just out of pure meanness, I smack the 3-spawn in
front of Ass Sup just to make sure I aint seen.  I drop down (Wan doesn't
aggro this time....wierd), summon pet, and then inch all the way to AM /
Hand.  I'm safe.  (I thought).  I med up, (nuff for pet-heal battle) and lay
into the dar/urd PH's...  Battle is going well and A STINKIN VAMP BAT COMES
AROUND THE FALSE WALL _IN_ AM ROOM!  I made it but just barely.

Whuts going on?!
