Actually, I found it this morning at Allakhazam's, and they said the same
thing.  Sure wish I knew where THEY got the numbers.  For a gnome enc it
takes 26m to get from 51-52, and 36m to get from 55-56 and I could swear the
leveling bar is moving a lot slower than 2/3 that of AA.  I could easily be
wrong, of course.
