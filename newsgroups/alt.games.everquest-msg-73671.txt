I am. Been not-getting-earthcaller forEVER now and my guild is giant
aligned while I refuse to kill the nice Dragons ;)

Oh, but on topic.... results others have parsed seem to indicate its
better than a pure additive - they (no idea how accurately) state
that the max hit comes out higher than a 21/29 would, and in fact
its more like a 16/29 vs AC and a 5/29 vs MR, add the results.

Which is nice.

*beams* ;-)

Sui, proud stubborn ranger who got the dang sword before the spoilers
were published and will SCREAM if it gets nerfed ;)

Oh, Dan - does your EC DPS count the DoT damage?
