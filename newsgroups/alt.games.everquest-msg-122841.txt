My iksar monk has, for the most part, grown up in the relatively safe
field of bone.

Now, at 24, he needs to roam to find more blueies to kill.

Last night I made my way over to OT, but this looks like a very inconvenient
zone for an iksar, despite the fact that it's pretty safe PK-wise.

So I think Warsliks Woods ought to be pretty good.  I spent 10 levels
in the Lake of Ill omen with another character on a blue server, so I'm
not real interested in going back there for awhile.  Plus LOIO seems to
have a large number of murder-for-money types there.

Being a monk, I never carry much money, so they rarely get anything much
off me if they do manage to kill me.  However, monks have no SoW, so corpse
runs are pretty long and a nuisance.

Any other recommendations besides Warsliks woods?  What I'm missing in
WW right now is other players... awfully quiet there, and visibility is
crap because of the trees.  But other than that, it looks pretty good; there
are some nice static spawn locations to farm some xp.  Also, I think there
are likely to be more PK'ers in WW than OT.
