Well, not melee, but the Charred Guardian Sheild is still a much nicer
off hand item than the ToV.  One less mana, but 10ac.  Nice for those
occasions when something does get close enough to you to smack you
once or twice before you run like the durid you are.  :-)

CGS is pretty cheap at this point too.  I saw one going on Xegony the
other day for 100pp.
