Hmmn - you really notice it if you spend a lot of time on newbie male
characters and then start up a new female mellee class of half elf or high
elf especially. I don't know if it extends to high level play as I have only
gotten female characters to the "lowbie" stage and not beyond though.

I have spent a <lot> of time at the newbie/lowbie levels under different
characters so noticed it quite starkly, most especially on a High Elven
Paladette.
