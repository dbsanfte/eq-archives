Any advise on cleric buffing for raids?  I can't MGB yet so I'm stuck buffing
the /tgb way.  Does everyone have this problem???  Is there a *guide* to
buffing for raids that I haven't read?  I NEED HELP!!!
1-  I always announce when I'm casting them, they don't take on 1/2 the group,
then 10 minutes later people are /telling me for symbol or virtue.
2 - Please!!!! if you have an hour left on your buff turn the darn thing off
and take the fresh one!!!  It's much more mana efficient to use the group
spells over the single ones.  
Last but not least, for all the people who've ignored #1 and #2, when I say
*full mana anyone need fresh buffs*, check your buffs and ask NOW!!!!!!!!!! 
Don't wait until the raid leader says *we all set?  pulling uber mob* because
then I don't have it memmed anymore and I need my mana for healing and I
guarantee there will be *THREE* people who decide that's the time to let me
know they are unbuffed.
I don't at *all* mind buffing you - I'd just prefer you not wait until the
battle is starting to do it :)))
