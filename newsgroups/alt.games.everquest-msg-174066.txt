Hate to break it to you, but Malo and Mala are the almost the same spell.
The only differences are Malo debuffs unresistably for 45, while Mala
debuffs unresistably for 35.    So your argument falls apart right there.

Why is Malo so much more expensive then Mala?  Supply and demand.  More
specificly, the supply side of supply and demand.  Mala is a common drop
from Juggs in Sebilis.   And I do mean COMMON.   It is not strange to walk
away from a night hunting juggs with 20 or more copies of the spell.   Malo
drops only from certain rare Kunark mobs.   Dragons for the most part,
Talendor, Sev, Gore, Guardian wurms in Skyfire, The Protector and the
Emporer in Sebilis, the named dragons in Veeshan's Peak.   And it's a rare
drop on all of them.

Occlusion of Sound is even easier to get than Mala.   It's a level 55 spell,
it drops all over Kunark lands, from random common mobs.

Or you could just look up the spell, and check the "resist" line.
