No, actually. The past weekend, I was parading out of Namao, and I didn't
have access to the Internet. If you really did transfer, get Raph to send an
e-mail, or ask him to make a side-post on the boards. If he does, I'll vouch
for your honesty. But you have to admit that anyone posting 'proprietary'
information to a newsgroup is not someone they should want on the team for
an up-and-coming MMORPG.

As of now, however, from the response to my e-mail and the information
available to the general public, I have to disbelieve your claim. Sorry.
