Digressing a little but I want to tell this story anyway.

My SK was aggro'd by Slate in EC. He'd landed a couple of his girlie like
punches ;ï¿½) and I so I started to run (so as not to embarrass him, I wasn't
scared or anything). So, I'm running away, putting some distance between me
and the effeminate, militia, cross dresser when I get an invite, I decline
it thinking it must be in error, but it comes and I am told "Join"
"What the hell" I think and accept....it's a bard...Selo's kicks in....OMFG,
I am now zoning.

You know that scene from the movie X-Men when Wolvie presses the red button
on Cyclops' motorcycle? Well that was what it was like.

There should be warning signs on large zones, saying, Caution. Bard with
tambourines, crossing.

Back to the original question, one of you was suffering from some packet
loss.
