    I think you're getting me confused for an uberguilder Dark.

    I don't want a game where you have to be level 70 with 500k worth of
gear to "get anywhere worthwhile", but I think they went WAY too far with
the maps and teleportation. I also think nowhere near enough money got spent
on AI with each new expansion, in fact they seem to be using the same AI as
Verant pulled out of their asses in 1999.

    Lastly, I think there are more ways of getting people to see the good
side of a game in their first hour of play than "making it easier".

    Just my epinion :)

cheers,
James
