Holy Wha!  I didn't realize there was no Breeze/Clarity in the Pre Kunark days!
 I've been playing for a long time, but apparently not quite as long as you... 
:o)

LOL!  Oh, I thought of another one too...

This conversation (albeit very paraphrased at this point) actually took place
between myself and another player a few months ago...

Player: What is Najena?

Me: Caster, not too bad if you know what you're doing but best to be grouped at
your level (she was high teens).

Player: So the zone is a person?

Me: Um...  No.  Najena is the only NPC that I'm aware of that has an entire
zoned named for her though.

Player: What the hell makes her so special?

Me: Well, before they turned it into a ridiculous quest, you used to kill her
to get the JBoots.  She used to be permacamped.

Player: What are JBoots and what is permacamped?

(AT this point another group member chimed in) 

Other Player: What do you mean she used to have the Boots?  I don't remember
her EVER having them and I've been playing for a LONG time now.

Player: Hello?  What are JBoots?

Me: JBoots are kinda like Instant SoW.  Click Boots, go fast.  And yes, she did
indeed used to have them.  Permacamped is basically... someone is ALWAYS
camping that spawn.  No matter when you log in, someone is camping her and
there is a waiting list to camp next.

Other Player: You're full of it.  You were never able to get JBoots just from
killing one little mob.  N00B.

Me: Whatever /disband

LOL

I forget sometimes that not everyone knows about all the changes the game has
gone through since it first came out...  hehe

So I guess another one would be:
'When I was your age' we didn't quest to hell and back for JBoots, we waited in
line to kill Najena to get them.
