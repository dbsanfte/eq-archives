I'm wondering if anyone out there is having the same problems that I am.
Ever since the patch that added texture caching, I've been having horrible
link death problems.  The connection meters are green for a while, then go
all red (sometimes resulting in link death), then go back to green.  The
period of this fluctuation is around 5 minutes or so.  I've tried logging in
with texture caching on and off, and it doesn't seem to make a difference.

I've called my DSL service provider and they swear that the line is fine.
I've also done multiple packet loss tests at dslreports.com and the results
are good.

Good this be something to do with the patch?

Thanks,
Keith
