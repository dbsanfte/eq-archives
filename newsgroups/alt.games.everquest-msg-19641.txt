I am sure it is rare.  But not 1k rare.  It is a level 39 spell that
might not get that much use. I could spend 1k on some nice clothes or
on a trade skill that will benefit me a ton more.

Does this spell stack with other Debuffs?

Does anyone really use it?

Do many Druids use it? I am level 40 and never gave it a second
thought.

I started over on the Vazelle server and the druid is my main.  If was
on my old server  I could maybe spend 1k on a spell for a twink.
