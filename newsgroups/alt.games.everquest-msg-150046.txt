My guild did callout loot for the whole of its history, where you send
a tell to the raid leader (or, in our case, designated loot caller) if
you would like an item that dropped and a decision is made. MOb
corpses rot after 8 or 30 minutes, depending on the level of the MOb.
In about a year as a guild raiding 3-5 nights a week, I think 2 things
ever rotted while the decision was being made and that was because
things were crazy.

At higher levels, you need to raid to get gear upgrades. You ninjar on
a raid, you don't get invited to any more. In more open areas like the
Kael arena, you get someone to lock the corpse while you decide.

Yup. We used to joke that ROT was the best-dressed character in our
guild and must be sleeping with the Guild Leader because she got a ton
of no-drop stuff. When we were doing Hate for epics, we would port up
and log out alts so that something wouldn't rot.

In single-MOb raids, the XP is rather trivial. In rich target
environments like Hate, Fear, and Kael, rogue and wizard XP tends to
go up while monk and shaman XP tends to go down.

Getting grouched at over loot was a major stressor and factored
significantly into my stepping down as Guild Leader, then to the
dissolution of the guild when no one else was really willing to take
up the reigns.
