My 53 druid uses charm all the time actually; it's a habit I picked up
after playing my chanter alt for a while. Druids can only charm animals,
so you have to pick your zone carefully; but let me tell ya, a
blue-at-53 rhino in EW makes a *fine* pet. Just be sure to ensnare him
*before* you charm; it helps immensely if the charm breaks prematurely.
