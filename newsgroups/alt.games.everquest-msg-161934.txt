Yes, I have 3 chars on Sullon Zek, one of which is still a 'baby'...

Ok, granted that the reasons you put down here are, in a way, valid, I think
I'm looking at it more from a "honorable" point of view, that being that
players who show respect to other players (meaning picking on players at
least somewhere near your own size) will have more respect shown to them...
perhaps I'm being naive though.

As far as the idea that they're PKing to make the area safe for their own
babies, if their babies had any sense at all they wouldn't be lvling in the
other factions' newbie zones.  If they are in fact stupid enough to do that
w/out protection, and they get killed, that's their own dumb fault.
Likewise if my baby player (Tunare worshipper) went into Iksar newbie zones
and tried killing Iksar babies, I would not consider it at all unreasonable
for an Iksar lvl-50 to kill him.  However, I'm talking about certain
high-lvls who on several different occasions came into the pit at Shar Vahl
and ran around on a newbie-killing spree.  Fun, fun, fun, I'm sure, but also
not likely to make me think very much of them...
