My fault, forgot what newsgroup I was in.... Now I'll make my question
very clear. Barbarians seem not to have an 8 piece newbie armor set that
culminates in a final quest for a newbie weapon as far as I know.

My Gnome Warrior obtained Initiate Watchman armor in his quest. My High
Elf Cleric obtained Armor of the Ordained. If I am still missing
something, would you be so kind as to inform me of the name of the eight
piece armor set obtainable by Barbarian Rogues and Beastlords and if you
also know what the stats are on the weapon part of the quest. I'd love
to do two more sets of quests on Stromm!!
