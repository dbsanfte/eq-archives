Well if you ask me LCD's are fine if you are looking straight at them,
still a little worse than just a regular 50 dollar 14 inch monitor
though. The fact is even though they take up less room, they make up
like half the price of your computer sometimes and even cheap ones
with run you like 150 or 200 dollars, and if you want to see whats on
the screen and you happen to be looking from anywhere but straight
ahead you're out of luck. I just don't understand the LCD craze,
manufacturers still can't make LCD screen with a very big success rate
so what's the point?
