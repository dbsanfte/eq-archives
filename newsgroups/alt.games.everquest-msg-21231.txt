Unfortunately, EQ Traders just says they don't want to improve on a good
thing and defers to Casters Realm (likely translation: they can't be
bothered with it when the webmistress isn't an enchanter). They only
have a recipe chart up which goes up to platinum, and no trivials. They
do have info about imbued gems that Casters Realm doesn't.

They also host an old jewellery site that's moved to their server, the
Tal Kor jewellery academy, at:

http://www.eqtraders.com/jewelry/index.htm

But that only has trivials up to gold.
