Yeah, my mage gated in one time and Faydedar was there... 
started whacking the crap out of me IMMEDIATELY.

Hehe... but I was prepared for that to happen to sometime, I made it
out with little under 2 bubbles of health and that happened in the
blink of a eye just about.

I had bound myself right in lava lamp and when your facing it, your
facing west.
So everytime I gated there, I made sure to be facing west before I
gated.  When I  zone in I pause for a moment, if nothing happens, then
I turn around and go to the pot I want to use.

So when she attacked me, I  instantly clicked on  lava lamp.
LOL....  clicking on a fire is more sure fire then gating, never gets
interrupted, but gating in firepot room is a moot point anyway
