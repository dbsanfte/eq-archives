I'm told that at these levels, the SK's best taunt is one you might not 
expect; Fear.  Like snare and slow, fear is high aggro when resisted, 
and at those levels, fear is automatically resisted.  As explained to 
me, the snare/dot is still decent aggro, but you can't count on it being 
resisted, so the fear becomes better for short term annoyance.  Of 
course the snare is still good because the DOT provides period 
refreshment of the taunt, but instead of chain casting it, they leave it 
running and chain cast Fear instead as needed.

I have not run an SK at those levels, so I can't say from personal 
experience, and by the time I heard this one, my cleric was no longer 
interested in tanking mobs with someone else in the party (I used to do 
it quite frequently in my mid 50s with a ranger partner, but didn't know 
about this option, so I'd use stun/root/blind to keep the mob's attention)

Paladins lack a fear to try this with, unless perhaps they get an undead 
fear, which would limit the targets its usuable on but might be worth 
consideration in those few instances.

And of course warriors, as usual, simply lack.
