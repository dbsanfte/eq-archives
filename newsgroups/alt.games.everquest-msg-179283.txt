Purely by accident, I was just exploring and talking with anyone who
answered my hail, I acquired an ore box from Yakum Oreslinger, who was
short of stock and needed a new supply.

I accumulated the unrefined small blocks of ore from gnolls in and
around Blackburrow. Put the blocks into the ore box. Gave the ore box
to Oreslinger who told me that he didn't need the ore box, I should
keep it. The unrefined ore inside was gone.

I didn't know about this mission until I stumbled across it. Now, I
checked sources about what "should" be happening and thought, "Okay, I
didn't do a 'combine' that time".

I repeat the effort. This time I click on the "combine" button and
check what is in the box -- it is now refined ore -- and gave the box
to Oreslinger. Again, he said I should keep the box and, when I
checked, it was empty.

In both cases, there was no indication/messages of any xp, faction, or
money that I thought should have occurred.

Does this quest/mission actually work? Am I missing something? Am I
using the wrong source for unrefined ore? I do recall that his spiel
talked about getting ore from Permafrost Keep.

A 7th (now 8th) level human ranger expresses his thanks for the
counsel of those who are wiser than he.
