Here's the problem with FD as a necro.  Most of the
spells you will be casting are DOTs.  If a mob has a DOT
on it, then it ignores your FD.

Now if you have been jumped, FD is great, you just lie
down and the mobs walk off... if it fails you need to
live several (very long) seconds for it to cycle back up,
but then you can try it again, and since it succedes about
75% of the time, you'll likely get it one of the two shots.

But if you pulled something and then decide you can't
take it after all, you have to wait for all your DOTs to
wear off.  A looooooong time in some instances.

Or if you are fighting something and get an add, you
need to kill that first something before FDing, unless
you can drag the add off a distance and rid yourself
of it and still go back to your original fight to clean
up.

Also, if you are low on HP (Under 100, I think it is,
not an uncommon occurrance to a necromancer who
is being beat on, having likely started the fight low on
HP due to Allure of Death...) FD fails.  Not sure what
the logic there is, I thought the idea of FD was that
the mob stopped attacking you because you were
"dead" but it seems that if you are "dead" but almost
dead it will keep attacking?  Perhaps the idea is that
you are so badly injured you can't keep from moaning
and twitching while you try to lie still.

Zoning, on the other hand, clears all aggro whether there
is a DOT on the mob or not.  Highly reccomended
if there's a zone line handy.
