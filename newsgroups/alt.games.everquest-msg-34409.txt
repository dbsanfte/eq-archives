Yeah basically if you can't handle a mob, zone.
More than that it cracks me up when you are near someone doing that
and they keep running by you going "HEAL"   "HEAL" if I reply at all I
just say "zone." Its odd because why exactly do they think you are in
the area sitting on your ass? If you are sitting in such places it is
because you are killing stuff and trying to regain resources, assuming
that you want to spend those resources to help a stranger is kind of
dopey.

Such help might be given but should never be asked for or expected.
