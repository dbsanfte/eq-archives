thats a good idea, and normally I would do it.. but this is a new computer..
I got it yesterday (about an hour before I wrote that post).. hehe..
downloaded nothing, the guy who put it together used only drivers from the
software cd's.  i bet one of the times the patch messed up my computer it
gave me a problem.. I got through that, actually, now I'm having (posted
above, actually) a Local File IO error.. the game is not running and none of
the files are read only.  trying to get through to tech on the phone, but
it's swamped, been redialing for over an hour.

Pendarric.
