Have you done a file search for "EQLS_window_pieces_02.tga"?  If you find it
in the EQ directory, delete it.. it might be currupt and is having problems
writing over it.  Also, if you haven't tried it, cancel the download and
click on "advanced", and make click on the "complete file check".  Let us
know.
