As I said, I don't recall that part. Provide a link to the logs if one
still exists and I will retract my statement. If indeed they can step
into guildchat, it's not a GM ability that guides are given knowledge
of. The friend I mentioned has never seen any indaction of his server
GM having the ability to do so. It's definately not an ability that
guides possess themselves.
