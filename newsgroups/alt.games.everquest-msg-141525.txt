Yeah, but get him one more level and you can bot him as
cleric_08_CH_battery_03, however, getting to 58 and getting Transon's
Phantasmal Protection (5 hp regen / 3 mana regen) will increase battery
efficiency also, and the level 60 Mala is a decent alternative if you don't
have any Malo enabled shaman with you (obviously not a factor for someone
like LoS, but worth considering for lower guilds), and if push comes to
shove, they can nuke like a druid.

Mages are not wanted for CoH, though it does have it's uses in some places.
They're wanted to feed the clerics mana while the clerics rez the monks and
chain cast CH.
