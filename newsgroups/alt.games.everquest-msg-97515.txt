And here again you get a chance to ignore said refutations while
shooting yourself in the foot again. First of all, the fact that some
hold the opinion that this patch will make some things too easy *has*
been supported. Eliminating the CRs lowers the learning curve. You read
that and answered it. You don't agree, but that's your opinion. Not
dealing with death issues makes death trivial until level eleven when
you will be dying far further from home, etc. etc.  You don't agree...
fine. But dont' say it hasn't been answered. 

Second, and more importantly as I see it, is your continual statement
that nothing in this patch will make the game significantly easier. If
that's the case, why didn't you like the spell book before now?
Obviously you feel that it's not making the game any harder. (And from
the chorus of outraged responses, you are obviously in a VERY small
minority here. Casters in groups feel that it makes it MUCH harder to
play in a group.)
