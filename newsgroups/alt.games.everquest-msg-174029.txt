No, if they had been "running the show then", they would have called
a ceasefire too, just as almost anyone would have, and for the
same reasons.

It's only in *retrospect* that it was obviously a mistake.  At
the time, it seemed the only prudent course -- the objective (ending
the occupation of Kuwait) had been achieved, and anything else would
have just been punitive and thrown fuel on the remaining fire,
and probably ignited a very major backlash as we blatantly broke our
word about the objectives of the war and our intended course
of action.

EXCUSE ME?  Ben, you must have been sleeping through logic class.

How, on Earth, do you make a flying leap from "looking back, it's
clear we should have knocked out Saddam" to "it really *was* about
oil, I toldja so!!"

You yourself said just a few sentences ago, "regardless of
why they did not", which seems to clearly imply that there are
many possible reasons for the ceasefire, and yet later
in the same paragraph you blurt out that John somehow
"accomplished" the opposite of showing it wasn't about oil.

HUH???

Nor have you in any way established that today's 20-20 hindsight
somehow "proves" that by gosh we're making a grab for the oil.

Attempt to be rational.

John makes a number of valid points, too bad they apparently
went way over your head.  Here it is in smaller words so that
perhaps you can follow along:  Twenty years ago, the anti-war
nutballs were all screaming "it's all an oil grab, shriek!!!!!!!"
And then, lo and behold, we left Iraq (and even Saddam Hussein
himself) in full possession of Iraq's oil, despite the fact
that we were in good position to confiscate it and certainly
*would* have, had the oil actually been our "real" objective.
Oops, the peace freaks were wrong, it turns out.

And now, history repeats itself -- the anti-American brigade
is whining pitifully about us making a grab for the Iraqi
oil.  What makes them any more likely to be right this time,
when they were shown to be fucking morons and conspiracy
loons the first time?

Lay down the keyboard and step away from the tinfoil hat...

Uh huh...  Wow, they can't put anything over on you and
your towering intellect, can they?  I'm so glad we have
you here to explain all these smart things to us.  Whatever
would we do without your insightful warnings about
what's "really" going on?

So let me get this straight -- the US doesn't really need the
oil and will pay too high a price for taking it by war, therefore
the US is indisputably doing this for the oil?

Don't mind the guys in the white coats, they're there to help you.

Let's play that one again:  You're saying that the dark conspirators
are smart enough to use the whole world as their unwitting pawns
and pull it off, and yet they're not smart enough to realize, as
you do sitting there at home in your bathrobe, that it's actually
not worth doing and they'd have been better off just having
another round martinis...

Do you even listen to your Grand Analysis before you post it?

Sigh.

One thing I'll say about conspiracy nuts -- they're consistent.
Nothing, in their view, can *ever* be done for a good, honest,
up-front reason.  It's always shady, back-room, nefarious,
motives by soulless monsters who would sell out their grandmothers
for a few extra bucks while chortling "MWUAHAHAHAHA!!"

Ben, did you watch too much "Captain Planet" when you were
a kid?  I'm especially fond of the one where the evil
CEO who was gleefully polluting the rivers was a spitting
image of the fat Jew on the Nazi propaganda posters:
  http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/posters/derjude.jpg

Ooh, while I was finding the URL for that poster, I ran
across this one, you might want to use it as a sign during
your next protest march:
  http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/images/lehmann/lehmann2.jpg
(Source: Der Stï¿½rmer, November 1939)
The (German, of course) caption it was published with translates to,
"Business is business! It makes no difference whether it has
to do with the crowning of a king or incitement to war."
Wow, it's amazing what a good handle those Nazi propagandists
had on those evil capitalists, isn't it?  How comforting it
must be for you to have found some intellectual peers.

Sorry, Ben, not all of us can tune to the same frequency as the
voices in your head, so it's a little hard for us to listen in.

Thank you, Mr. Paranoid.  And now, we return you to your
regularly scheduled newsgroup.
