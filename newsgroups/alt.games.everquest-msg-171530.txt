I'm trying to get to Paludal.  I've looked at the map and walked to what
appears to be the place in Shadowhaven, but I'm too chicken.  Just exactly
what is the best way to actually get to this magical experience area.  Do I
have to swim or jump?

On a related note, how much do people swim?  Is it really important that I
teach my Druid to swim well?  If so, how has everyone learned to swim
without dieing?

Thanks
