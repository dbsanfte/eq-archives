She was simply giving advice to lower level rangers. GSoTFW might not be a
weapon every ranger can aqquire and IMO its not a weapon that would be given
to a ranger over a PAL/SK/WAR if they needed it anyways. Shadowflame however
is an easy to get weapon off a mob that it takes perhaps 30 minutes to kill
so any ranger could aqquire it.

Speaking from the Clerical standpoint I dont care WTF goes on with a persons
health if I dont have a problem its OK. I get angry when other people
complain that so and so is taking damage or whatnot but hell Im the only one
using the mana here so if I dont mind then theres no problem. If a ranger is
tanking I dont care what thier DPS is or what weapon they use as long as
they get "teh H8" so I can use "teh big heal bomb". Wether or not the mob
stays alive for an extra 10 seconds or not really makes no difference. But
IMO its a good thing when the tank is taking less damage. DPS can be left to
the other group members.
