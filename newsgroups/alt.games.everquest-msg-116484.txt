Not true.  I've never every played either the Paladin class or Shaman
class in the almost 3 years I've been playing the game.  It's very
likely that there are people out there that have been playing since
release that haven't played the Ranger class, particularly since they
had such a suck reputation (I'm not saying they did suck, I'm saying
that was the reputation) for a while there.

And Atticus, my ranger, was created September of 1999.  FYI.
