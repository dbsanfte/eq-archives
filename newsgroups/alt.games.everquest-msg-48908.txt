I say they do help you, you say they don't. I say the goal of '60 as fast as
possible' is counterproductive to enjoying the game, you seem to disagree.

Read it again. It incurs more downtime the FIRST time. After that the mobs
are broken and you are killing superior exp-and-loot mobs one at a time,
just like outdoors. Only better.

So that I stop getting 50+ people applying to my guild with no gear and few
skills. Add to that a lack of understanding of their classes abilities and
the capabilites of others.

Jealous? Nah. I certainly get amused when they tell me how fast they
levelled to 60 though, as if they expect me to be impressed.

I refuse to believe any ressed death costs an days play. After 49 you lose
so little from the res its insignificant. Before that you can make back the
exp from an unressed death in an hour, never mind a ressed one.
And again, my point is that there are more ways to measure game progress
than "yellow pixels per hour played". I've never given a crap about fast
exp. Ive played nearly 2.5 years. I made 60 after Velious was released. I've
been to every zone in the game apart from PoM and played about every class
other than paladin or bard and that's why I'm still enjoying the game and
have never felt it's a 'treadmill' or a 'grind'. Lots of people complain
about this, I'm just trying to help people prolong their enjoyment of the
game by taking time to smell the flowers, not rushing and generally looking
at the game from a different perspective than "race to 60 get guild raid for
phat lewt". The side benfits of this are greater understanding of the game
and a more rounded skillset.
On top of that, dying is something that should be practiced. Death is
nothing to worry about in this game unless you are focussed solely on
levelling as fast as possible. Some of the most fun and satisfying times
I've had in EQ have come from a testing CR.

Ok here's an example:
Recently in ToV my guild got trained with 4 drakes at the entrance. I called
'fight' but several new members, who shouldn't even have said a damn word
called 'camp' (at the zonein FFS. Everyone was bound just outside). This
created several seconds of confusion that lead to some key deaths, and also
some people camped out. The upshot of this was that we lost the fight and we
should have abnd could have won it.

Also, you would be AMAZED at how many people dont root park and have never
tried it. I am also fighting an uphill battle against retarded clerics who
levelled too fast, and dont cast CH "cos I get aggrod" and then have the
gall to say they don't use their Barriers either. I'm talking upper 50s
clerics who are so clueless as to disregard their BEST spells in favour of
going oom from chaincasting Divine Light.

The exact point I'm making here is that these lessons you say are "not hard
to learn" apparently ARE. At least in my experience. I blame the ease of
outdoor levelling.

I make fun of others for the sheer pleasure of it.

And you see no difference in the abilities of players who did this compared
to those that didn't?

I've never envied those players with more gear and levels than me. I played
the game my way, chose a path other than that of least resistance and
enjoyed it. Now I go on those raids as someone with a clue, someone involved
in the planning of tactics, someone with something to add, not just another
spectator waiting to be told when to hit /assist.

They don't need 1337 gear. Bog standard run-of-the-mill gear makes old
planar raids half as difficult as they were preKunark. Not to mention the
spells and the innate bonuses of having those couple of extra levels.

 They have to do a LOT of

Sure. I said 'hardly raids', not 'not raids' :)

Ah the old 'your opinion differs from mine so you have no clue' gambit, eh?
Does this uber rogue have his poison, trap and PLock skills all maxed? One
of my guild's rogues was somewhat embarrassed to find he couldnt unlock the
VP doors the other week. Does this guy do the guilds CRs or is that left to
someone more experienced? Was this his first character ever or was it a
server switch? Could he CR a guild twink dead in Dalnir? Could he even find
Dalnir (for example) ?Who the hell cares about glory? What's he gonna do
when he's got all that gear? Be bored and quit.

And through being killed you learn, or get so frustrated you quit. Either

Exacly. Levelling up too fast makes you ill-prepared for the later game, be
it though lack of skills, understanding or patience.. My point exactly.

 They think that raiding glory will be

And if you are patient you won't mind spending some time learning dungeons.
Notwithstanding the argument about the usefulness of dungeon skills at high
level, dungeons are certainly where ALL the fun of EQ is hidden. And most of
the good loot too.
