   Teckla, there are many personality types on this board.  I haven't
noticed the tone of yours as being all that polite.  That's fine, there
are alot of other people here who post in a dogmatic, in-your-face
manner.  But if you can't handle it when people are rude to you, then
perhaps you might want to work on social niceties your own self.

   You implied that people who have less than perfect genes that decide
to become parents anyways should be shot.  That is a global, drastic and
controversial view.  You are certainly entitled to it, of course.  But
if you state it publicly, then you open yourself to be questioned about
it.  Remember, you said that people like that should be shot.  That's
pretty final and drastic for the people involved.  

   I don't deal well in abstracts.  So let me ask you about your
position using myself as an example.

    My dad is obese.  So am I.  If I had a kid, there is a good chance
that I would pass this on.  Should I get shot if I have a kid?  My
father also has diabetes.  I do not (yet) but there is a pretty good
chance that I carry the gene for it.  Does that earn me a bullet?  How
about this.  My mother was a drug addict, who committed many felonies,
and eventually ended up dumping me with a bunch of hippies in the
Arizona desert when I was 14.  Clearly, she had problems.  Current
research suggests that failure to cope constructively with life on this
level is a result of both environment and genetics.  It would be
reasonable to think that there is a fair chance that my genetic material
contains element that may lead to predisposition to anti-social
behavior.  Does this earn me a quick, messy death should I breed?  How
about all three points taken together?  

   There's a problem with broad global statements.  In order to make
sense, they have to be applied to individuals, and since we are all
individuals, we have an urge to respond statements like this.
