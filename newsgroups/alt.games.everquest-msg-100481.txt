  You're missing the point.  There is something instrinstically offending
about the words "Soandso is inspecting your equipment" that is buried in the
soul of every being of goodness that has been birthed in the cosmos.  You
can't apply logic to such a deeply ingrained truth of the human makeup... it
is a truth and you simply have to accept it as such.  The very idea that
some thoughtless creature might inflict upon a fellow human being those
damnable words without even asking first is an unforgivable sin.  It does
not matter that one can choose to have those words hidden with the inclusion
of a simple flag in a file... covering our eyes to an atrocity does not make
it go away, and deep in our hearts we can FEEL it when the terrible
"inspection" as it is focused on us and the malignant will of the one
perpetrating the act, we can feel the tear in our souls even when it does
not register with our five most familiar senses.

  Look within to find the truth and stop wasting your time with your
"reasons" and excuses.
