Another duo that you may want to consider is the Monk/Shaman team.  I have
not heard how bad the nerfed Monks are now but two friends of mine duoed an
Iksar Monk and Iksar Shaman.  Having a 41 Warrior myself I know first hand
that unless the warrior is over twinked, he or she will lose one on one with
a monk of the same level.
