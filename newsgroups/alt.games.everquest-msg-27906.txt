Well from the looks of it, I've hit a nerve with you and this is heading in
a direction that I don't care to go, so I'll cease trying to explain it to
you from an actual shaman's point of view.

I think I've explained it the best I can, having months of experience.  If
you disagree, that's cool.  I only know what has worked best and most
efficient for me in my experiences as a shaman; -melee while in a two man
group sure as hell wasn't the ticket for me and my monk partner.

Cheers,

Harken
