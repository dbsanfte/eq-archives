So there seem to be a large number of quests in shadeweaver, here are a
few
I've found so far, please add more and we'll perhaps not end up throwing
out useful drops or keeping tons of useless junk.

There is a guy standing by the pillars just outside Shar Val who has a
number of interesting armor quests.  Each involves bringing him 4 of
some object dropped
off specific mobs in the zone.  Here are the ones I got him to discuss:

Boots: 4 shade claws (drop off lesser shades) AC 5 HP 10
Sleeves: 4 loda kai earrings (drop off loda kai brigands)
Cap: 4 Loda Kai Insignia (drop off loda kai thugs) AC 6 HP 10
Gloves: 4 sharp broodling mandibles (drop off cht'thk broodlings)
Tunic: 4 carapace of Cht'thk broodluks
Pants: 4 fangs from suarek claw beasts
Bracers: 4 skulls (off loda kai brigands) AC 4 HP 7

It would seem likely that there are more pieces I wasn't able
to get word of, and it looks like all pieces are a little better
AC than the padded leather that you can buy in Shar Val, and
have a good bit of HP in addition that should add up to a nice
buff if at low levels, particularly for the untwinked.
