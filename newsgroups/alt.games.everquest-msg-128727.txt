Paula,

 The two are "mutally exclusive".  That is to say, if they were to 
leave Israel alone, they would be left alone to determine their fate.

Don't be silly - if it were a personal genocide, the Pali's and Arofat
would be gone long ago, ergo Rawanda.

Much different!!  in WWII, Hitler made it KNOWN that he set out to
exterminate the Jews. In Rawanda, it was KNOWN one side was out to
eliminate the other side.  The Pali's, before thier exploding vest
tricks, although not perfect, were NOT being sought out to be 
eliminated, and in fact, were offered the BEST deal *ever* by Clinton
and YET they turned it down.  You are gonna have to make a MUCH better
case that the Pali's are so abused and mistreated before anyone will
see your case as serious.  Until then, the world will continue to
see the Pali's as a group of mal-content trouble makers that neihter
Egypt, Seria, or Lebanon wanted, who want nothing more but to fight
and cause trouble.

Then FIGHT then!  ...Look, you can't have to BOTH ways! - Either fight
and get what you can, or shut up and quite whining. Only the "winner"
is respected, and no one respects the loser, and definetly not a whiner.
