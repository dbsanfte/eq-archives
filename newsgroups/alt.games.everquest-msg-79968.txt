Harumph.  I saw the patch message, so did quickly edited my
eqclient.ini and removed the UseUmbra line.  Gads, for me it sucked.
Went back to slow zones and 'jerky' video with lots of little pauses.
That's with a GForce2 MX (32MB), Athlon 900, 768MB.   /camped and
added the UseUmbra=FALSE line and all is well again.

Damn.
