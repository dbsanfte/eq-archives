Nope. Because you have to have a personal Acrylia Slate, which as far as I
know of, only Vah Shir can get. And you wouldn't be able to use any of that
gear, anyway (Its Vah Shir only).

There are other quests you can do there, but other than the Bloodling Shield
(which will be long and boring), none of them are really worth doing at your
level.

As an alternative, if you either have PoP or don't mind waiting for and
paying for ports, go to East Commonlands (West Commonlands port or Freeport
stone in PoK to get there) and hunt willowisps, then collect any lightstones
and greater lightstones they drop (but leave the burned out lightstones
alone - they're no drop and worthless). There's a female NPC named Sythian
at the gypsy camp in Oasis of Marr (two zones away from EC - Ask for
directions) who you can give the lightstones and greater lightstones to in
exchange for items you can resell for plat and a little bit of exp. (Each
Greater Lightstone will get you a Concordance of Research, which is required
for Int casters to do research. Its a container, and I think Lore, so make
sure you have an open slot and only hand in one Greater Lightstone at a
time. Sell her the CoR before handing in another GLS. You can hand in up to
4 regular Lightstones as you want, though)

If you do the Lightstone route, make sure you summon a pet as soon as you
zone into Oasis. And keep a close lookout for Ghouls, Drybones Skeletons
(they cast fire spells, besides meleeing), and Sand Giants, especially. And
get out of the zone as soon as you finish handing in the lightstones. Its a
bad place to hunt, and you don't want to sit down to rest there.

Also, http://www.eqatlas.com has a hunting guide you should probably take a
look at.
