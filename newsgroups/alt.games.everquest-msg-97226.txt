I don't exactly remember being "kicked in the balls," as you so eloquently
put it, for my own comments. I stand by all of my posts because I believe in
what I write, so frankly, I don't give a damn about what others think of me.

I know how to search on Google, but I haven't found any reason to perform
one on anyone else but myself. To me, my memory is a much better source of
the truth.

From what I've seen here, you're the -total- aggressor using your past
animosity (can you say "stalker behavior"?) to either start a conflict, or
tarnish his image. Handy Solo and I merely pointed your obvious malice.

It's a real shame you are (admittedly) intelligent, or at least logical, for
much of it goes to waste.
