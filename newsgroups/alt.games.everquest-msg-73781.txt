The pickup group syndrome. At any given level there are usually several
zones to hunt in. But most people tend to head to the same places. A lot of
people do the LOIO, FM, OT, DL cycle in Kunark. Not terribly exciting but
keeps the exp coming in. So why do they do that? Well, you can get a pickup
group there. If I'm level 30, for example, I can bounce between LOIO, FM,
and OT until I find a group. Three zones right next to each other. A place
like Stonebrunt, for the same level, is virtually empty. If I can't find a
group there and I can't get  a port out then I'm looking at an hour of
running and boat rides to try again to find a pickup group.

Here's what I think EQ needs. A central travel hub/zone that has portals to
just about everywhere. Similar to the Nexus, but all-encompassing. And NPCs
all over the place that can transport you to the hub. Yes, I realize that it
is not really in keeping with the role-playing aspect of the game but I
think it would be better from a game-play point of view. People can gather
in the hub and can start making groups for whatever zone they wish. Then
when they are ready they can take the portal near that zone.

I think this would help people spread out, would get people to use those
empty dungeons and underutilized outdoor zones, and would make it easier to
find groups in general. It might make the LFG flag more useful as well since
you would be able to do a /who all LFG level-level and find people that
could get quickly to whatever zone you're in via the hub. Perhaps a way to
do a shout to the hub zone if you're looking for more members might be
possible.

Once again, I realize this is not part of the vision. But, for the pickup
group crowd, people tend to congregate in the areas that provide the best
chance of finding a group. I believe that a central area to congregate and
form groups would help greatly.

What's everyone else think?
