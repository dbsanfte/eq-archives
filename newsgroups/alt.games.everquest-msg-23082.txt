This is correct in a party of 6 and the loot 5p 5g 4s 10c the looter would
get 5p 5g 4s 5c everyone else would get 1cp. For this reason and others most
higher player us the Master loot method where 1 person loots and does a
/split P G S C at verious intervals to even the shares This does require you
to trust the looter to be fair but you will still come out ahead. Even if
there is some minor skimming.

There is only one place that I know of that drops anything close to that
kind of loot HG Valley in Rathe Mts and it ranges from 10-50p average is
around 20p. Higher level mobs drop Items not so much in plat.

The
