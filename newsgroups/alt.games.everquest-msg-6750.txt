I was unaware that my eating root beer and sushi -wasn't- turning stomaches
the way I thought it was, no wonder noone reacted.

I mean this.  I'll be standing inside the bodies clicking and still be getting
the "you are too far away" message.  I've learned the proper position to
loot either of these two bodies, but I'm sure there are plenty more in
the game that were just as difficult.  When they say "really large" do they
mean just Terrorantula and its ilk, or are the merely "large" critters included
as well?

Previously there was a patch that made bow and arrow damage work as
intended, drastically improving the archery skill as a combat tactic.  Now
its possible to bring delay down... if you could drop delay on your melee
weapon you'd be just as excited as archers who use their weapons as more
than a pull device will with this patch... and of course the tailors who've
been making this useless item will be as excited as they were back when
tailored bags suddenly became weight reducers.

Hmm, pure sarcasm, can't think of a way to reword it, there was no real content.

Just joking again.  I do think size changes are funny... but I'm aware that
the tiny item will still fit in a kit until it is removed.

Not sarcastic, an honest question about the translocate line.  Wizards
already have enough troubles, did they just make them slightly
more useless by forcing them to seperately mem gate to be included
in the translocation?

Very very sincere.  I was on SOV the first few days when the gaurdians
dropped spells fairly regularly, but I was too low level to use Celestial,
and generously supplied my higher level clerical guildmates with my two
drops.  After all, I was only 36th, and I'd been leveling so slowly it would
be months before I was ready for the new spell.  A couple weeks later,
I realized that SOV is much better leveling than I was used to, and went
back for my spell... only now most of the guardians dropped nothing
at all, it took three days to get my spell!  As I'm at 36th (or maybe high
35th when I log back in) I'll soon be ready to go get it again, you can't
imagine how happy I am to hear that it won't take me another three
days of killing the unrewarding wurms.

Serious question.  Looks like they spent time fixing something that wasnt' broken.

Sincere.  I've even seen a case where someone claimed (and knowing
them I believe it) that they looted and destroyed an Icereaver thinking
it was a regular Drakkal Forged Bastard Sword.  Heavy, only worth
a few pp at a vendor, not going to bother taking it to EC or GFaymart.

I got the message about what he'd looted, of course, but he didn't, and
hadn't looked.

Sincere.  Nothing bad I can think of about having more room for friends list.

Yep, sincere again.

Ditto.  Too late, of course, but I can at least go back to my spare
Luclin character and re-ad the names I remember.  Names of
Morel Thule buddies do no good at all on a Luclin character's
Friends list.  I'd like it if they did give me an option to search
several servers for friends, without having to log in to each, but
we can't have everything.

Quite sincere.  Only discovered that you could do this a couple
weeks ago, made smithing practice much handier.  Arrange your
packs right, and you can dump all your product onto your "portrait"
to fill them up, then go sell whole backpack loads simply and easily.
Same thing with "junk loot" you gather in the field, just put it in
your "junk pack" and know you can sell off the entire contents
swiftly and with style when you are next near a vendor.  Is this a
major "nerf" no, its just one more instance of unnecessary mousework;
thing is here its a case of the mousework being reinstated, while in
other cases they have been -eliminating- it (stack buying, for example)

There, feel better?  My wife is the same way about sarcasm,
frankly, I grew up on it as a staple, but to some it seems
to be a real stumbling block.
