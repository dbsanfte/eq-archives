*That* is also semantic bullshit. Doesn't matter if you really believe
what you or saying or not, you are saying it, expect it to be treated
with the respect it deserves....

You are oversensitive. If you take up a stupid argument don't act all
huffy when it gets blown up in your face.

And as each gets trashed you move the goalposts. Very intellectually
dishonest behavior, sadly more common when someone is "just trying to
stir debate". You seemed to be attempting to bog down the debate
rather than accept any resolution.

Incorrect.

Yes, you're spewing bullshit in this nebulous display of "intelligent
discussion" apparently to annoy anyone who disagrees with the
viewpoint you've chosen to defend.

What you're defending is demonstrably wrong (and has been), and
refusing to accept arguments to that effect while simultaneously
altering the premises is the same as any defense lawyer who defends
reprehensible behavior by bringing up even more dispicable arguments.
Doesn't matter if the lawyer believes it or not.

He was provoked. Defense lawyers for obviously and egregiously guilty
people always come across as creeps. In this thread, you remind me of
the OJ defense team. Throw enough loony and inconsistent theories
around and hope the gallery gets confused.
