Uhh, bright boy, look again. Do a search on this petition. Last count,
I found 102 groups. just because YOU see one in the header does not
make it the only one it's in. 

Trust me, sonny. I have been reporting spammers longer than you have
been using daddy's computer. They can and do get disconnected. Many
get a warning and stop, which is fine. it is against the contract
daddy signed when he bought the cablemodem. The TOS or AUP, the
contract associated with useage of the service. Violate it, you are in
breach of contract and they are no longer obligated to give you
service anymore. Pretty simple. Ask mommy to explain it to you, maybe
they can get the idea across.
