Thanks Perverbian, the info was right on target.  Got the traitor last
night.  He was right outside of Guk to the Northwest.  He was
stationary once he spawned.  I noticed he spawned on the exact spot
where a zombie had been standing for several hours.  I wonder is the
zombie is a PH and needs killing, because that's how I got him.
