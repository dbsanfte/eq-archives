Two reasons many druids dislike playing healer I think.

1. We aren't all that good at it.  At lower levels we're adequate, but
it's still not really efficient, and at higher levels it get less and
less efficient.  It's still possible for a druid to play healer, just
no the best way to go.

2. It's boring as hell.  Druids get used to playing offensive caster
so much that when it comes time to just sit on your ass and wait to
drop some judicious heals they just can't take the waiting.  Clerics
have my utmost respect for doing the job they do.  God (of their
choosing) bless 'em.
