That would be sweet, but alas, no. Internet connection comes into a
box in the corner running BeOS and some firewall software. NIC in
machine goes out to a router, which sends requests to the specific IP
of each port. Broadcast packets are not sent, and if the packet does
not contain the correct IP addy, it's dropped. No data on the firewall
machine, other than the OS and firewall. Access past the firewall
means bringing the firewall down, or gaining permission. Trojans fail,
as the requests for egress come on the wrong ports, and have no
permission. SirCam failed, because none of my machines communicate to
port 25 (I admit I suck at SNMP, so I don't use it). IRC trojans fail,
port 6666 has been aliased elsewhere, and if it ain't my IRC software,
the firewal ignores the alias and lets it flail away at a closed port.
Port scanners receive no response, it appears to them that my machine
is not present. Pings do the same. A DDOS against the firewall IP is
fine, and would work in choking my bandwidth, it really ain't hard to
DDOS 56k. It will be 256k soon, but out in the boonies where I am, the
options are limited.
