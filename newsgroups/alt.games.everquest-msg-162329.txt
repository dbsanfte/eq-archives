Warning, mild top post:

I can't respond directly  to most of this post because it makes claims as to the
nature of the zone Plane of Valor, for which despite a very long day, I am STILL
not flagged.  Expect major snipping.

Or move.  Yes.  Don't camp on the train tracks.  If you are getting a train
every 5 minutes then you really can't be out of the way.  Lets say worst case,
the zone is a huge circle and the zone out is in the middle.  Lets say that
amounts to 8 general directions a train can come from.  For you to be in a
random location some distance from the zone and still get a train every 5
minutes, there would have to be 96 trains per hour.

If you are looking at a more reasonable one train per hour, then yes, your call,
move it or deal with it.

See above.  I can't say for sure, but I find it extremely hard to believe in a 5
minutes between trains that hit YOU if you are selecting a camp site with care.
If you were talking PoI, where its relatively hard to find an out of the way
place, I'd be more credulous.  But wide open?  Like PoN or PoD wide open?

Yes, and you'd have every reason to be pissed at those people, assuming that
there are people periodically spamming the sacred word "train right, med left"
and making an effort to explain it to people no matter how tedious it becomes.

There's literally no reason at all to train the declared safe side, since its no
closer to an exit and the mobs don't care at all which way you run, unless you
are counting on the people sitting near the line to get sit aggro and buy you
the extra half second you need to make it over the line.  Thats criminally
callous and self absorbed behavior.

People do it, but they are wrong to do so.  You hear the same shouts all day in
PoN, but I propose to you that in this case, most of those shouting are in the
wrong.  I suspect from your description that the same is true of PoV.

That would make it a good deal more unlikely.  But you were asking for mobs that
currently don't have summon to get it.  Would this help on those mobs, since
they aren't inside the castle to get stuck?

Those are bugs, are you hoping that Verant (I just can't call them SOE, thats a

If nowhere is safe, then most places can't be trained very often, or else the
zone is incredibly tiny or very poorly designed. Is PoV the new Unrest?

Sure you know where its headed to, or is the PoV exit near Burned Woods, moving
around like mad?  Look away from the exit and see if there's a train moving your
way.  Odds are its going straight there, so if its not coming from the other
direction, logic suggests its not likely moving over you.

People DO train around in squirrely zigzags., but most of those people die early
since the mobs run straight lines and catch them

You say "the rest of the zone" but really you mean "the one group that was in
the way."  If you could prove to me that every train automatically hit everyone
else in the zone, or even more than one other group... heck, if you could even
prove it was impossible for it to not hit at least one other group, you'd have a
point.  But as far as I can tell, I'm definately on the hook, and anyone else in
the zone has a relatively small chance of getting hit if I train to exit, unless
they are deliberately standing on the exit.

SO by standing still, one person/group dies, odds 100%.  By running, perhaps
maybe another group gets trained... and if its a mob I can survive running away
from, then how is it not a mob that that other hypothetical group can't run away
from?  Seems to me, odds are very good noone at all dies, this looks much better
than 100% I die.

I wouldn't trade you dying for me dying.  But I'd trade risking a slim chance of
you dying for a certainty of me dying, and then do all I can to avoid that slim
chance, by shouting Train to zone, and keeping my eyes open on the way in
looking to avoid groups that I see in the way.

In which case your earlier statements that there are no train free places are

As I say, this sort of death isn't your fault.  Its unfortunate that exit is so
near GY, this never happens in PoJ.

Well then won't the group dying anywhere but at the spawn spot for the mobs do
the same thing?

Again, "the rest of the zone" is overkill, unless perhaps PoV is a special case
like Unrest.  Granted that PoV is somehow special in this way, I'll grant you
that training instead of dying there would be reprehensible.  However I stand by
my arguement as far as most zones, and specifically about PoN, the zone where
I'm experiencing this sudden, seemingly purposeless constant shouting about not
training.

Am I doing it to you, or to the entire zone?  Make up your mind.  At any rate,
call me what you will, but at the same time, start looking for a way to deal
with the phenomenum, cause the vast majority of people in most zones will
happily run over their grandmother if she insists on sitting on the train tracks
to the exit.

These people are irritating, I'll grant you that, and your advice (to seek
another plan or another zone) is sound for them.  But I doubt removing them all,
even if it were somehow possible, would cut trains down by more than 50%.  Most
people get in a jam every now and then, and most of them will run to zone if
they can.

Unless, as I suggested, you have an unpredictable exit location, this really is
fairly trivial.  Even at worst, a shout of train should make everyone take a
look around for unexpected adds for a few minutes; I know I've had groups killed
more than once by adds that we just didn't realize were there until too late (
same name as what we were fighting, so the extra hit messages just looked like
the mob suddenly got a haste...)

You miss my point here.  I didn't wonder what you did in terms of making a tidy
little list, I wondered how you dealt with the problem.  In KC, most camps are
train free, only zone in, LCY, and Captain seem to get a lot of passthru
trains.  Did you insist on staying "on the tracks" because of your philosophical
belief that people shouldn't train, even though they do?  Or did you learn,
adapt... or did you surrender and leave the zone?

Every 10 seconds yes.  Every 5 minutes even.  Once an hour, though... seems like
par for the course.

Because there's a strong tendancy to train docks or along the beach in Oasis,
which hits people waiting for raft, or low level hunters who are barely capable
of taking down non aggro crocs.  In LOIO, though, what would you train, perhaps
windmill... DL, I can't think of any spot people normally hang out that is
popularly trained, other than the "wrong side" of the entrance/exit.  KC, here
you have a train tracks design, unlike Oasis where its simplicity itself to NOT
train if you have any sense, and still make it across a zone line.

Are they in a zone thats' too easy for them?  Or do they ALL always die rather
than move five feet to a zone line?  Or do they refuse to shout train warnings
using your theory that without an azimuth and quadratic equation the warning
itself is useless?

I could be in Crushbone for a week and never shout train to zone.  In PoN,
though, I'd expect one every couple hours unless I was in a well oiled group
doing something dead easy, and noone else nearby to hit me with their trains or
(just as deadly) spilled mobs from when they died.

Read my paragraph you are responding to.  If it happens every 5 minutes for an
hour, then its almost certainly going to be happening every 5 minutes the next
hour, and the next, and the next.  Your expectations are idealistic and
unrealistic.  Refer to whats happening around you, not to what you wish was
happening.

It would be nice if every group consisted only of excellent players who never
make a mistake, every set of mobs never got a lucky break, no connection ever
went LD at a bad moment... but nice doesn't really answer well to reality.

Expecting normal players in a difficult zone they aren't highly familiar with to
all handle everything perfectly all the time is living in a dream world.
Expecting them to always die in place with a perfectly good zone line nearby to
prevent inconveniencing you if you happen to be in the way (and they can't be
sure you are) is... living in a mental ward.

Yep, yep, or worse to try zoning OUT of AR.  I bound there once.  (puts on Joe
Piscopo voice) Once.
