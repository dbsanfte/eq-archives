The Jews might have said "yes". But the state of Israel appears
incapable of staying within it's own borders. The saying "yes"
would carry a lot more weight if they had kept within the 
1947 boundries.

When were they last given a serious opportunity for viable statehood?
A piece of land with bits of a foreign country dotted all over it
(the "Settlements" Israel has stuck all over the West Bank & Gaza)
hardly made a viable state. Doubt Israel would agree to having
Palestinian "settlements" all over their country...

First these settlements would need to go and there would be 
a need for a military powerful enough to defend the borders,
against Israel (or a small number of nuclear weapons).
