Somthing not mentioned so far I think....

Being a ranger with Snare and having a cleric friend that has Fear.I
would suggest you both head to North Karana then South Karana.You two
can do what is known as Fear Kiting.Where by you pull the mob to a
realitivly open and less traveled MOB area then cast snare.Then have
your cleric friend fear the mob.It will slowly run from you while you
wack on it to death =)

This method is the best and least dangerous way to level fast.You
should do just fine if you stick with evn or blue con MOB's.Using this
meathod you can go all the way to 60 if ya have the desire...although
getting a couple other tanks to help kill it will decrease the time
needed to kill a MOB.

Hope this helps and Grats on picking the Best class in EQ =)
