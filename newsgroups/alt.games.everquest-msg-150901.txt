Well, it's a -wedding-.  I may not go to a wedding set up for a raid, 
otherwise, /showspell would be off anyway.  Would you tolerate gratuitous 
displays of spell effects in the bazaar, and blame it on the quality of 
other people's connections, or would you recognize that it just might not 
be the most social thing to do?  Not everyone has the world's greatest 
connection...  Some people even use >gasp< dial up...
