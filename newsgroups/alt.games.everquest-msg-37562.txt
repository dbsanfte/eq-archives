Well excuse me all over the place.
I saw that line and i thought it was funny, it hides no deep hatred of
homosexuals believe me, It's a joke, nothing more nothing less. There are very
few things under the sun that are inapropiate to have a little joke with. I
dont consider homosexuality to be one of them.

Think of me what you will but in my opinion you are nothing more than a fucking
knee-jerk Politically correct, 'humour challenged' product of a society that
tells you to jump on the case of anybody who says something that might offend
some hyper sensitive asshole in a <insert your minority group here>.

>So, in conclusion, sod off and die, homophobe.

Homo'phobe' would imply i have a fear of homosexuals, I do not, and for your
viewing pleasure the offending sig has been removed.
