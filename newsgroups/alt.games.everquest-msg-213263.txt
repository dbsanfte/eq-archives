If you plan on soloing most of your career then the JBoots will be a good
choice at level 31.  Jboots are about equal to a low level casting SOW on
you.  If you plan on mainly grouping with others than a horse would be a
better choice.  tboots are still sold by the same gnome that sells the Bag
of the Tinkers.

A little added benefit at higher levels with the Jboots is when you are
going against a mod that can de-buff you.  Since the effect is instant
without any recast time then when you are fighting something(usually Raid
encounter) that can debuff you spam the Jboots.  Make sure the JBoot effect
is your 1st buff.  Then when mob debuffs you the instant JBoot buff can
replace itself.
