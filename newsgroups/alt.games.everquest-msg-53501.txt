    You died horribly. 8) I met her twice. The first time I was level 20 or
so and she was trained on me. I died before I was even able to touch my
Divine Aura hotkey. I knew that someday, I would come back for her. The
second time was during the "Rubicite in Najena" GM event. People were
shouting about the Widowmistress being up, but nobody was going near her. So
I took my level 49 to 52 (can't recall, she WAS still blue) cleric over
there and, in a close fight, flattened her and got my rogue a Bloodclaw.

    It's not TOO bad, given that my cleric could kill her, but I imagine she
has silly AC. And her attacks must be nuts - dual wielding (and likely
double attacking with off hand too) with two weapons that can have 20 DD
procs (plus two ticks of 15 damage - she's proccing Bloodclaw on you, you
know). And as another poster mentioned, she backstabs.
