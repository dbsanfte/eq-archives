Considering even a darkelf SK can trivially bring his/her STA over 100
from their equipment this would be only useful to the degree that STA
adds +hps.

My twinkie warrior uses a SoD in his primary hand.  Wanna know the
difference between 140 DEX vs. 200+ DEX?  Jack and Shit.  Seriously, I
have no idea if or when my DEX is buffed or not since the proc rate
difference is so minimal it's barely worth the mana.

Primal Avatar on the other hand, that's a damn fine buff...

Stat buffs, with the exception of STA lines, is largely a waste of
mana.  Fortunately, most of the JB stuff have right click stat buffs
so it keeps idiot meleers happy by tossing a buff icon on their
screen.

The REAL reasons why shamans are more useful vs. druids are Slow and
Haste.

Even the lack of snare is addressed by the SK's darkness lines.
