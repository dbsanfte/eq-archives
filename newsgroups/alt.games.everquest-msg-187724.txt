First, why do you care where the low levels are?  

True newbies are still in the zones near the cities.  Saturday I
talked to a true newbie level 5 Paladin in EC.  He needed to know
where he could buy a bag.  He was having a good time in EC and later
Nro.  Leveling wasn't the end-all for him.  The people that want to
zoom thru 1-24 love PC since it cuts time in these tedious levels. 
The only negative affect I see, is the market for Deathfist slashed
belts dropped as experienced players no longer buy these by the
boatloads (or farm the orc camps for them) since they can go to PC and
powerlevel their alt.  Now, the only people who really want them are
faction folks.

PC is a big zone.  The only overcrowded areas are the bandit camps (at
least on my server).  Almost no one goes and fights the bugs in the
back of the zone or the grimy owlbears.  If they want to eliminate an
overcrowded PC zone, then they should add an additional 4 or 5 bandit
camps.
