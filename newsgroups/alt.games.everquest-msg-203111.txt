www.thesafhouse.org. DOES have some useful information. and allot of it 
is in the Forum (will need an Ezboard account)

The safehouse has some libraries and a FAQ section to help you in 
determining what race you may want and where to put your skill points.

As for being a desirable races.. sure there are others that many players 
would like to group with but the rogue is still a VERY useful class to 
have. the Backstab can help deal out ALTO of damage to cut down on melee 
time. Plus a backstab on a casting mob does have the chance to interrupt 
it's casting.

Rogues get to sneak past mobs with their own form of invis(hide). which 
can be used for corpse recoveries, as well as scouting areas.

Plus there are some places in the game that you can't get to without a 
rogue to open locked doors.
