my main char is a cleric, but I also have a lvl56 human monk.

1. I cant really comment as my monks a human, though I believe its fairly
easy to fix faction i nthe old world.  There are plenty of Iksar monks out
there with epics.  As far as diferences between the two go, human monks
owned the monk BOTB contests, but this is more likely due to experience of
the oldskool players.

2. unfortunatly you dont see many monks using fists anymore due to the
abundance of good blunt weapons.  The optimum weapon combo at lvl60 seems to
be a staff of shielding in offhand and first for primary using the epic.  I
myself use a tranquil staff (will get epic one day, but not important to me
atm) and do anwhere upto 130ish a hit with it, lots of double attacks
though, I supose H2H hits come in around the 60 mark.

3. flying kicks usually get around the 100 mark, maybe a bit more.  Flying
kick with the thunderkick disp can net anything frmo 24 to my best so far
which is 215, innerflame can net you a couple of 300+ kicks in a round :)

4. a succesful FD when someone else is taunting is a great way to shift
agro.  It will clear agro enough to be able to do a bunch more dmg, before
the button recycles.  Its a great way to manage agro.

5. depends, taunting helps with this a lot.  As a monk, you'll probablhy be
pulling, so its not allways wise to join a fight.  I usually sit the fights
out, lining up mobs with my agro, its a lot of fun.  If you can join in on
the fights, just make sure you get someone taunting in there or FD a couple
of times before you get stuck in.

6. monks currently sit in between rogues and warriors for damage output.  I
decently equiped monk will do more damage then most warriors, though
warriors with good equipment can do more damage then a monk.  Rogues own all
for melee damage.  FD is your real skill though, damage is nice, high AC and
skill max's are nice, but in the end, monks pull.

hope this helps,
Matt.
