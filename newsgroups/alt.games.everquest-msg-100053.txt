There are lots of folks in this thread who seem, IMO, to be
"overanalyzing" every nuance of one statment made by one SOE employee.
Let's remember, folks... we're not talking about national political
figures who have speech writers combing over every sylable they utter
ahead of time to prevent any foreseeable mistake or blunder. This is a
guy who works for a video game company answering off the cuff questions
for a gaming magazine. Perhaps he might better have said "... not yet
able to discuss what level increases may or may not occur..."

But is it that big of a deal? I'm sure they'll let us know.
