Ever seen anyone get upset by people referring to breeze/clarity as
crack? I had a friend who got involved with crack cocaine and he was
seriously messed up. Messed up to the point of hanging himself in
september of '93. Mind you he wasnt the most stable guy but crack
definatly did a number on him. I dont get upset or really care when
people in EQ call it crack but I do find it somewhat crass. I suspect
most of the people saying that are teens whove never done it but like
to joke about it like its cool or something. On one occasion, when I
was in a particularly bad mood, some caster rushed up to me in oasis
and said "CRACK PLZ" then I told him i wouldnt buff people who call it
crack. May not have been nice of me to say that because he probably
doesnt associate crack cocaine as a deadly, addictive drug. Then again
im not always nice...
