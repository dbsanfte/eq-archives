Im not in an Uber Guild but I believe I can speak to the NToV question. I
can only assume that you actually mean Halls of Testing, and not actually
NToV. Halls of testing would eat your guild alive as it stand right now Im
afraid. The main reason for this is the nasty AE's that the dragons proc
there. We make it a minimum of level 55 ( due to the resist changes that
reportedly happen at 55 ), and unbuffed FR/CR of 125. They are slowable, and
dont run so snare isnt needed. You DO have to worry about them gating
though. Any White mobs there are gaters, and possibly chealers also.  Also
unless your all dubious or better to CoV faction you could have some serious
problems with just getting in. Sontalak guards ToV, and I believe he also
sees invis.

Have you guys been doing Kael Arena, or Plate Cycle to outfit your tanks ?
If not this is a good way to get some raiding experience for the guild, and
also quite possibly some decent equipment for your tanks.

It also sounds like you could raid Veksar quite handily, and theres some
really nice equipment that drops in there.

What ever you do, have fun at it, and learn the ins and outs of raiding and
each classes role. Raiding opens up a whole new EQ experience :)
