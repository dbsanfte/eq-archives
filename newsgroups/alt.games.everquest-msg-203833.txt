Monks bring more than this!

We are the pullers. We are the scouts (when H&S won't work or there is no 
rogue present). And our DPS is only exceeded by a Rogue. We can tank to 
some extent, albeit this ability has been mostly neutered these days for 
all but the uberest monks.

On top of this, we are a melee the cleric usually does not have to worry 
about, since we can mend and drop aggro easily, as well as being able to 
avoid death if we get smacked around while the cleric is mid-CHeal on the 
MA.

In dire circumstances, we can bind wounds to 70% without any AA- if the 
medical AAs are invested we can bind to 100%. This has actually helped a 
lot with some groups I have been in with a pally as the main healer- he 
used his healing helmet (the 100hp one) during downtime, and I bound anyone 
else that had taken a knocking.
