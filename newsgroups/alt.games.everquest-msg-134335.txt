so set your price at the high end, and when you get tired of it taking
up your space, lower your prices until you find a buyer...

getting the best price on stuff (either buying or selling) is an art.
some people spend all their time in trade channels/zones and have it
mastered, some people (like myself) just want a reasonable ammount of
cash so they can go buy a fun new toy.  does it bother me that the guy i
just sold my iron oxides to could probably turn around and sell 'em for
150pp more per piece?  not really, because he'll spend a lot more time
trying to sell 'em than i cared to spend.
