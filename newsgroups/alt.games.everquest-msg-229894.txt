I notice the silk produced by the xakra silkworm HAS NOT BEEN NERFED!!! So
if you want to make leather padding and have access to rockhopper hides,
this is your best bet. Just take PoK book to shar vahl newbie area and start
slaughtering. I notice it doesn't seem to sell well in the bazaar tho, not
sure why, since LQ rockhoppers drop a lot from rockhoppers farmed by high
level types looking for lucid shards.

Also, if you are low level and want to grind, kill the bloodlings, as the
carapaces sell for a bundle in the bazaar (100 each) but seem to be a rare
drop so I don't think much of farming them if they don't give you xp... and
they don't give me xp so i will struggle until i give up and buy them :P

Also, if you forage, keep the payala fruit and sell them in the bazaar, but
advertise that they are good for brewing skillups; 1 of them and one flask
of water will improve the skill with a lot less mindless tedium than most
every other recipe.

p.s. if you see tobalus in the next few days and have some of those
carapces, give me a tell if you want to sell them and i'll see if i still
need them. They are essential for people learning smith by doing
shadowscreem armor. Or keep them if you want to go smith and lookup the
quest. Acrylia plate smithing is painful and noone buys the end product now;
it's a shame, i hope in eq2 player crafted items are better than droppable
and have level requirements to make all levels of crafting valuable.

Speaking as someone who finally bought ornate leather boots for 18000 only
to see the price drop to 14K straight after! ;-)
