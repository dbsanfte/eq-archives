Other possibilities.
Rathe Mtns HG groups. See a lot of LFG shouts there, and they'll still all be
blue to you. (Hell, they're blue to me at 44). XP can be sucky, but of course,
the money rocks.
Great Divide.  I did 40 in the kodiak caves there, and all the bears were
still giving xp and they are plentiful if you don't mind the *very* infrequent
looting opportunities. Other hunting possibilites in that zone too, depending
whether you are working on Giant or Dorf faction currently.  Not as many p/u
groups as Rathe or DL, but you still see them getting formed up.
SolB.  I still get invites sent to me anytime I'm within a few zones of there
(Freeport) asking if I want to help form up a King's Room group, etc.  But
unless I"m all stocked up on shrink potions, I don't go, of course. :-)
