I guess you mean abjuration, I think your HP may do this (or is that
alteration, haven't played in months).

You can check by holding right mouse button on your spells, it should say
which type it is.  Failing the HP buff any resist buff should be abjuration
(I think pala get Magic Resist at some point).
