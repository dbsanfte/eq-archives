No.  Never will either, I can't abide camping something like that.  Being 
a shaman does have it's advantages in that respect.  If the mob is up, 
you will get the drop you need.  All the mobs are on regular timers.  The 
longest I have camped something for a specific item was on the order of 
90 minutes.
