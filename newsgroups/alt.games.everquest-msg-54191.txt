Halfling can wear ulthork. Its better really than tizmak but a bit
harder. Get a 49 or whatever druid buddy or someone and do walruses in
south in eastern wastes (the higher ones) The druid can fear them now
so its not that hard (could bring a tank also) Then kill any man o'
wars who spawn. They can drop the ulthork legs and more importantly
the bp which is 3 wis and 30 mana or something. Up north ulthorks drop
the arms which are nice at 3 wis and same graphic (all of these are
velious leather graphic like tizmak)

You'll probably get legs while trying to get tunic, they are not super
great but match and the 9 charisma on them helps to make up for the
minus 5 charisma on the bp.

You can also buy some or most of these pieces fairly cheap (except bp
which would be more.)

You might try being ghetto and auctioning in EW every so often "Giving
49 level XP res for X (being the ones you want) pieces of ulthork
armor" Clerics often forget that people REALLY want a res and someone
with an ulthork bracer or boots, arms or whatever piece they know they
will have a hard time selling later would jump at the chance to give
one for an xp res if they died and want a res.
