    "Essentially" - the stuff legal debates are made of. :-) A quick
rephrase by the seller makes it quite clear that the account itself isn't
being sold, since the "seller" not only cannot transfer title to the account
but can also come back at any time with the original account info and
reclaim sole use of the account. As many playerauctions types have found
out.

    They can certainly rent out use of the vehicle if we don't explicitly
restrict them from doing so. They cannot transfer the vehicle itself (at
least not in the legal sense), as they do not have title to the vehicle.

    If a landlord didn't have a "no sublets" clause in the lease agreement,
and didn't do any screening on applicants for a room, he'd have a very hard
time in front of a judge trying to explain why he bounced his tenant. If he
has legal/contractual rights to bounce anyone at any time for no reason,
then he's fine. Note that Verant has put exactly such a "we can yank your
account at any time for no reason" clause in the EULA, likely for the same
reason. It gives them an extra reason to fall back on if ever something like
this went to court: "We yanked the account because it was E-Bay'ed against
our EULA, and even if we cannot prove that, we can yank an account at any
time as per the EULA."
