There's lots of folks who like to say that, and they even teach it
in the schools.  Might even have been somewhat true in the north.
OTOH, it has long looked to me like the south used states rights as
a propaganda issue used to justify starting a war in the hope of
retaining slavery.

Well, if public support from a substantial faction of a major political
party is required to make it "real"...  But there were an awful lot of
people pushing the issue from long before the civil war who thought it
was pretty damned "real".
