it's difficult now...i should be keeping an eye on him because he's
obviously so disturbed mentally that he feels the need to escalate this to a
personal nature and involve real life...

imagine that...a 43 yearold man that's supposedly very well off that spends
his entire day posting to a NG and trying to get someone fired from their
job that he claims works in a buffet line and then admits his previous lie
when he admits that he's been trying to get that person fired from their job
at a ebusiness consulting group...

kind of puts things into perspective don't it?

I keep changing computers and keep forgetting to killfile him...and almost
get sucked back into the Avenger Abyss of stupidity...
