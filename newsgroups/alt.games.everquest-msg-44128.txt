The goal for level 50 casters is for half mana
to take 2min to recover.  However, if you go below
half you take longer, to the tune of 6 minutes from
empty.  (IE It's really slow going when you're empty,
but it gets faster until you reach normal rate at 50%.)

Their logic is that they intend soloers to go after
blues, and groupers to go after even and higher
cons.  Because higher cons give so much more
xp, which is what makes groups so much more
effective, they needed a way to make overall speed
of leveling (solo) the same whether you can take
a blue con with half your mana or a yellow con with
all of it.  I would think this is to make grouping more
attractive without *requiring* it.

I'm not sure how I feel about that notion, have to
wait to see how it plays.

(I can't remember which thread I read this in,
but I'm pretty sure the numbers on mana regen
at 50 were from a dev.  If not, from a class
team lead (they are in regular contact with the
devs))
