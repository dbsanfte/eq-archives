You acted totally wrong, if someone in zone is after a random spawning 
mob in a zone that they have no chance of covering themselves, everyone 
should give the mob up, and tell the person when it spawn.

I tried hard to tell people that when camping the AC in SRo (for my 
monks boots, not worth camping for MQ), and when my monk were camping 
Raster in Guk, but for some reason noone seemed to be listening.


And to be serious, that guy, AND his guild leader must be total morons. 
True, the mages need the cloak for epic, but do that mean that only 
mages is allowed to kill mob? Could be you killed to MQ for your own 
mage, or a friends mage. Or what if a group of people get more jade 
reavers in CoM that they got people on raid that need? Should they tell 
everyone in zone to come loot?
At least you now know that both members (at least 1), and the guild 
leader of that guild are morons, and know who to stay away from, and who 
to laugh at when they need help and youre the only one around to help :)
