Twisting is the ability two  have 2, 3, or in some case 4 songs pulsing at
the same time. Typically you will pulse a self haste, party haste, then some
mob effect like a dot, snare, or slow song. The use of hot keys is critical
here, you basically hit one hot key to start the song once it pulses you
double tap the next song you want to start, once that one pulses you dbl tap
the 3rd song hotkey. Then start back over again.

Only a few songs require an instrument in off hand to play, Shauri's
Sonorous Clouding, the group invis/see invis coming to mind. Songs will be
enhanced when using an instrument though, Selo's Accelerando is much faster
with an instrument, especially something failry cheap like a Tamborine of
Rituals, as opposed to not having one equiped.

Commonly you will only switch back and forth between a weapon an instrument
when you switch from combat to downtime mode.
