This one's already been answered to a greater degree than I'd be able
to answer

Again, answered. You can also tell where your bind point is if you use
a 'soulbinder', they bind your soul exactly where you're standing when
you say to them "Bind my soul"

>Are there some sort of in-game maps (because I keep getting lost)?

The latest expansion, The Legacy of Ykesha, provides an in-game
cartography system (a series of maps of all the major zones, and the
rest you can map yourself with it).

If you don't have that, eqatlas.com is the best place for maps.

Whenever they speak, certain words appear in brackets. If you ask
questions about these particular points, sometimes repeating what they
say in the brackets, you'll get a response.

Again, Legacy of Ykesha provides a journal/conversation recorder,
which records everything different characters say for easy access.

However without this, I'm afraid it's the old fashioned pencil and
paper, which is actually something I'm quite fond of...very
traditional way for me to play an RPG game like this (I have a large
EverQuest binder)

All characters can be healed above 50% as far as I know, just sit down
and wait for the health to increase, or cast a spell.

Ahh, you have learnt the valuable lesson. When you're fighting
creatures which /con blue, white, yellow or red (red is a very bad
idea however) you should stick close to either guards, or the zone
line. It's the best way to handle practicing, stick near guards or the
zone and you'll be fine.
