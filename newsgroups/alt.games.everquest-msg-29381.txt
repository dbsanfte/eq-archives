I wouldn't recommend saying this, as it will only make the enchanter look
like an idiot. =)

The Enchanter can both slow, and haste, the party better then the bard.
If he's bugging the bard about doing it, he's handicapping things greatly.

And from 53 on up, the bard is quite good at mezzing duties. (all
the bards sounding off so far are not at that level, so do not know.)

From 1 to 52, people do their utmost to support the 'must have enchanter' 
mentality. Its hard for them to leave it. I think it gets hardcoded
in. (Probably supported by the Enchanter 201 union)

Then again, this is true for many of the big '3' classes.

But, in many cases, its just not true. (in some it is, don't get me
wrong, but many it is not.)

People are sheep.
