 You know you've been playing EQ too long, when you refer to a traffic jam
as "lag".

 You know you've been playing EQ too long, when you petition for a "boss"
when something goes wrong at work.

 You know you've been playing EQ too long, when a teenager drives by in an
expensive car and you think, "damn TWINK!"

 You know you've been playing EQ too long, when you refer to your cup of
coffee as a SOW potion.
