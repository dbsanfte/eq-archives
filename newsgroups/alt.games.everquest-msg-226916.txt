/random for raid loots is the worst possible method, IMO.

You hit one of the big reasons right on the head.   It rewards and
encourages sunshine players.  Not every mob has equal loot for every class.
The IV for instance drops a very nice Flowing Thought 2 neck, and I think
another FT piece.   But all of his weapons have become dated and of little
interest to melees.  You don't run a very successful raid with a wizard main
tank.   Similarly tryiing to get clerics into Sleepers Tomb for primal
weapons would be nearly impossible, without quite a bit in the way of guilt
trips and guild drama.

The other big reason is this...  it's all random, and one loot roll has
absolutely no effect on the next.   There is no disincentive to roll on an
item that is only a small upgrade.  Or even is equivalent to what you
already have.  People will roll just to get new toys for themselves, while
other raiders not so lucky on the dice can fall way behind.   If they talked
about it, it would probably sound like... "Woot!  I upgraded my cloak today,
took a 5 point stamina hit, but I went from 80 to 100 hp on it....   the
other warrior?  I don't know.  Had some gimp +10 stamina cloak, I think."
