There are different formulas for how int affects mana when int is over 200.
I think there is also a different formula for level 50 and below than for
51+.

There have been different formulas floated around, but assuming your int is
over 200, then it looks like around 5.6 mana/int would be a reasonable
assumption.  Both for ease of calculation, and to bias slightly toward int,
so that I won't risk dropping below 200 if I swap out items for resist gear,
I use 6 mana/int when comparing items.

So, I'd go for the +40 mana item, all other things being equal.
