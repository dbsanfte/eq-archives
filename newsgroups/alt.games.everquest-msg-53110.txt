It'd have to be some really good gear, it's still pretty uncommon to find a
twink with a Cloak of Flames.  The haste cap is 85% pre 50, and 100% post,
so nothing short of Wonderous Rapidity is going to cap someone without
dragon haste.

To the original poster, as a rogue, I can't say I'm fond of being made 20%
less effective.  Sometimes it's necessary, but... if mana is a problem, why
not give the casters breeze instead of clarity? :p
