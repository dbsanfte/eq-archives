I realized after I posted that it was only L65 hards.  So long as you 
have a good puller, healer, slower, a decent tank, and some DPS, anyone 
can do L65 hards.  I've done them back when my best piece of gear was not 
even ornate.  The trick is getting single pulls, and killing them fast.  
I recommend a bard for pulling and all around enhancing DPS/Mana regen/HP 
regen.
