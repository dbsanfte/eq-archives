They must hate the SBLive card and/or Win2k.  That's the common thread with
those of us using them with this game.  How depressing, even Creatives
*brand new* XP drivers make the sound in EQ sound just like Win2K - MP3 play
back skips like a broken record until you jump or do anything really that
makes noise in-game - just like you said levels are *way* inconsistent, it's
just asinine.

To Verant:

Big news Verant! - unlike the undermarketed Windows 2000, XP (like it or
not) is going to rock your Norrathian world and I'm betting there are a
shitload of your paying customers out there using very new PC's *and*
Windows XP using some kind of SBLive! card (or they will be, didya notice
those sblive cards are EVERYWHERE?).  heh  You're finally going to have to
make the goddamned sound work under Windows 2000 AND Windows XP.

Funny how you just can't run from shit like that as a software company
(knowing how customer demand for new OS's will always push your current line
support to uncomfortable limits) and sooner or later you'll stand tall
before the man - us.

Anyway, I expect this bullshit fixed by Luclin - no later.  In-game
hotkeyable Winamp control - included within the client itself - would be
sweet too.  See whatcha can do wouldya?

Yours truly,
Pissed off SBLive owner/SOE customer
