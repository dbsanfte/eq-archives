After the U.S.S.R. fell, yes.  But what caused that to happen?  We made them
hit the overspeed trip via the cold war.

That's a two-edged sword.  How much more often does that situation result in
a coup, and the installation of a military dictator?  Oh, and the British
Army didn't take the side of the colonists.

To give them a fighting chance.  It may not be much of one, but it still is.
It took a para-military force from the ATF to raid the Branch Davidian
Compound.  That's alot of level 50+ (or one quad-kiting 25 druid).  You
gotta drop some decent loot for that raid to happen.
