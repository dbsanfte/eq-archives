To read notes you have to be in windowed view (not Full Screen), have the
note in an open inventory slot (not a container) and right-click on it.
That will give you the guildmaster's name.

The stairs are kinda to the right as you go in the front door.  I usually
just stumble upon them, which I find kinda funny considering how small the
building is.  Try jumping over the bar, go into the back area then head to
the right some.  The stairs lead off TO THE LEFT though, so don't be
concentrating looking in the wrong direction.
