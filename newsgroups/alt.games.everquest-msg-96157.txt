I didn't think anyone was KoS in Shadowhaven to start?

If you're not, then raising factions there is trivial.   Do the Amulet of the
Haven quest, from Trade Commissioner Henry.   After the first time doing it, I
was able to buy and sell there.   After an hour or two of running it, I was
ally to the merchants.   If I really wanted to, I could keep going and ally
the dwarves and the other two houses if I wanted as well.   (Some day when I'm
really bored.)
