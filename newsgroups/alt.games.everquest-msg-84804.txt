TwoHead,

    Thanks much for the response below, however as far as I know I do not
have a firewall. :-(  I checked my WinXP settings and my Linksys settings
and I think anything related to a firewall is left uncheck or not active.
Sadly I don't think the problem that lots of people are having with frequent
disconnects have anything to do with a firewall. Oh, well, something smells
in EQmark and I'll just have to wait patiently for someone to fix it. Thanks
anyway for the help.

HC
