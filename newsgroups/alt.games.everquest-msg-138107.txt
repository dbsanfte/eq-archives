Nah. Battle rezzes are mostly for fights that are a game of inches.
When you're not sure if you can take a MOb, you do battle rezzes. The
first time our guild did Dozekar the Cursed, we came out of it with
all five clerics oom, both Oracles dead, and a druid keeping the main
tank alive with Chloroplast. We did about 8 battle rezzes and probably
added about 20k damage because of it. It can be the difference between
success and failure.
