I can understand alot of what you wrote, and even agree with some of it.
I think, though, the reason why they were charging so much for the game
at first was because they didn't know how many people would like it.
Now, since they see that there certainly is a market for it, and they
have a reasonable customer base, they can afford to charge less, and
still turn a decent profit. 

Just my 2cp.
