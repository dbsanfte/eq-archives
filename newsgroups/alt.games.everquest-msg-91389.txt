I'm not trying to flame, but the story just doesn't seem to be true.  I
mean, it's a little outlandish for it to happen once, but for basically the
same thing to happen twice (yes, i do realize the zones where different, but
the plot was the same)???  Sounds fictional to me.  And no, I can't relate
to it.
