It's a full level equivalent to level 51.  You have to redirect the xp from 
levelling into alternate experience.  To do this, open the alternate 
advancement window, hotkey is "v", and set the experience split however you 
like.  The amount of XP it takes to get one AA point does not change as you 
level, thus, it becomes easier to get AA points when you are higher level.
