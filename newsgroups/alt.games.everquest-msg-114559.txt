Right.  I was just saying that when your skill has reached that level, you will still
see a lot of failures.  A lot.  Tons.  Great steaming piles!

I recall trying to help out a newbie by making her (?) character a bunch of tattered
leather armor.  My skill was at 26, the trivial level for tattered.   I failed four times
in a row trying to make arms, and then three times in a row trying to make legs.
Bleh!

Guess there's not much incentive to attempt stuff that trivials at or slightly below your
trivial level unless you really need it for some purpose (someone offered you an insane
amount of plat to make it for them :)
