AFAIK regular Hide is the same as regular invisibility (which does work 
on a surprising number of undead). Rogue hide I understand is "better" 
and works against almost(?) everything.

Wow really?...offhand the 30th level Judicators and Justicars in the 
feerott (AE stun, AE nuke), the 12th level drakes in Lava Storm and 
Steamfont (AE nuke)... and countless others. Perhaps you just weren't 
paying attention. :)

Yes.

/camp
/quit

In some cases /quit is preferrable because you don't have to sit.
