I would say that I'm an asshole in real life. On the other hand I devote
quite a bit of time to charities, not just giving money but actually
working with them. I wasn't always an asshole though. There was a
time(in my 20's) where I felt good about humanity and had a belief that
everyone could be helped. I know better now and feel very "live and let
die" about things.
