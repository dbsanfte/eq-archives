Never heard of it, whats it sell for?  Sol A, should make
it what, a level 30 mob more or less?  Is it a rare pop?
I'd think the thing would be as camped as JBoots are!

Is it all/all?

Of course, only nightblind race no remedy classes (human,
erudite, barbarian; warrior, monk, rogue, cleric, paladin..
thats it right?) would really care... but I've seen a metric tonne
of people who refuse to play those race/class combos simply
because they want to play more than 12 hours a game day.
