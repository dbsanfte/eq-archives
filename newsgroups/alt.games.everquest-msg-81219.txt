lol.. well, if i've got 4 bubs of HP left, and you cast a cheal on me, I'd
find a new cleric/group.

There are many other things clerics can do apart from heal - MoK, MoR, Stun,
Nuke, Root, Blind.. I would much rather a cleric take advantage of their
mana for something worthwhile, then just cast a cheal that barely heals
anything.

Just wait for what exactly? To group/raid with high level casters? (im a 60
monk, my wiz is 58)
Casters don't have the AC to stand up long enough to wait for a cheal if
they have agro, even if they have 2k HP (Divine and Celest, or CE)
