It seems like the map files from the upcomming PoP expansion has been
leaked, and someone has run it through somee EQserver emulator for map
screenshots. 

http://pub125.ezboard.com/fantoniusbaylecommunitycentrefrm1.showMessage?topicID=1700.topic
is my source of information, and

http://destinyeq2.sourceforge.net/ is the place for the maps

http://eqemu.sourceforge.net/planes/ 
is a link to screenshots for those of us who dont run all this wierd stuff,
but would like a peek at whats comming

It looks like eyecandy, looking forward to play it.

The zonenames looks interesting btw. Plane Of Tactics (think, dont just
rush it) and Justice (no ninja-looting, autosplit mandatory) has a
potential in the names

OR its an uber hoax done by someone with way to much time at their hand.
