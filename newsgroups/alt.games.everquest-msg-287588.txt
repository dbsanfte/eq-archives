They took it out ?
I still have that choppy behaviour for about 10 seconds after zoning.
Even worse I have it randomly now when being in a zone for a while.
What I wonder is do they really have nothing better to do instead
of changing something which worked fine?
I run EQ on a AMD Athlon 1.33 GHZ,9 years old,with a 64 bit graphic
card and it was just running fine before those amateurish attempt
to improve something which does not need any improvement.
Another issue which makes me shake my head.
