Actually, Horizons is made by Artifact Entertainment. It's PUBLISHED
by Atari, though.

A brief exploitation, Chuck: It's an MMORPG that has tons of neat
ideas and miles of potential, but has come up short due to being
rushed out the door before all the content was ready. I just did the 7
day trial, this being a little over 3 months after its released, and I
can say that it IS getting better. This is probably almost where it
should have been on release. If they keep this up, it will probably be
great in a few more months. Only thing is, they may lose players by
that time.

Horizons is currently, however, a great "social" MMORPG. It's
definitely not for the powergamer crowd, which is actually a good
thing. In spite of its shortcomings, I enjoyed it as a side diversion.
If I had the money to spare, I'd probably subscribe for something to
kill time here and there. They have an absolutely magnificent crafting
system (IMNSHO). Problem is adventuring has a lot to be desired. But,
even it can fill the time. It would help if they gave in and put some
real loot armor/weapons on mobs rather than relying on it to be purely
crafted gear. Just make it rare, and keep it so the crafted stuff can
be better. Ultra-rare and/or unique mob loot formulas would help, too.
