Well, one thing to consider is that one day software companies MIGHT
realize that instead of sending out software on three CD's, and
worrying about space limitations, they can send that out on one DVD.

I know that there's only been a few software titles released on DVD at
this point, but it does seem like they should start pumping them out
more on DVD.

Granted, logic isn't always was moves the PC market.
