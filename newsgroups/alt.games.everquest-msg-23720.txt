I never stated that America was a democracy . In point of fact it is not
supposed to be one . It has been acting like one though for the last 50
years at least and why I believe we have a great deal of trouble in our
system .

----  [I stand corrected and agree with your analysis.
The US was not designed to function as a Democracy originally.]

The money isnt the problem per se its the lust for power . Most of our
representatives give us what we want for the sole and complete purpose of
gaining and then keeping power . The money is incidental .

--- [Hmmm, not sure about that, why then does Congress regularly vote
pay increases for itself? Do you know of any Congressmen that waive their
salaries?
I'm not sure their wives would be too keen on that idea. I've been told that
the last
Mayor of Los Angeles (Riordan) chose for himself a $1 yearly salary
because he was already well off.  I tend to think that in our Capitalistic
society
Money and Power go hand in hand.]

The problem then becomes that you need more than half the people to decide
on issuses based on knowledge and science instead of feelings or emotions .
Since we dont have that we have blackouts in california , property rights
being destroyed systematically , and the growth of a dependant class . Worst
of all we have a goverment actively discouraging the teaching of our kids
because educated kids will grow up to be responsible people who just might
understand enough to make the system work .

---- [Now we come to the crux of the issue, and I think we both agree,
there is a severe lack of Rationality in this country and a lack of respect
for Reason
and the ability to think through issues. Knowledge and understanding
(education)
empower people and then they might start seeing through some of the lies
that
are propigated upon them.]
