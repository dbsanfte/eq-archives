See my response to him, it's relevant to your argument as well.

Them's fightin' words, son!   :-)

The difference is that not even *Clinton* believed Clinton's
hypertechnical definitions (e.g. he claimed that he didn't lie
when he said that he and Monica were never "alone", because
they were not "alone" when they had not-really-sex because there
were "people elsewhere in the building").  He didn't believe
his own obfuscation, he was just weaseling.

I shudder to be placed in the same category.

I, on the other hand, mean what I say.  You think I'm being
too technical, I think you're being too loose with your
definitions, but that's okay.  It's fun to argue and explore
the differences.

No, I'm not -- I'm honestly giving my considered opinion that
the rules *don't* currently cover the example given, and that
Tigole has found an actual loophole.  I'm trying hard *not* to
"twist" the rules, I'm trying my best to read them exactly as
written, no more, no less.  I have no axe to grind in this
matter, I neither know Tigole nor have any characters whose
names rest on a gray area of the rules.  I'm just giving
my analysis of what the rules, as written, actually say, and
do not say.

In my view, you're twisting them by stretching the word
"misspelling" to cover more than I think is supportable
by the usual meaning of that word.

Disagree with me if you want, but please don't say that I'm
"twisting" the rules when I'm doing my best to adhere to them
as directly as possible (in my understanding of them, of course).

If Verant had instead used the phrase "suggestive variations",
or somesuch, you'd get no argument from me.  But they didn't.
"Misspellings" is just one category of word-mangling, and
they mistakenly left the door open for other kinds which
would produce "objectionable" names.  This is my only point,
I'm not trying to do whatever it takes for questionable names
to squeak through under any circumstances.

They should revise their rules slightly to cover such cases,
and then we'd *all* be happy, rather than leave in some
loopholes (or even ambiguities) and cause some people to say,
"wait, that name you're forcing to be changed arguably doesn't
actually meet any of the written criteria..."

No gr[ae]y area, eh?  Is "Peenki" misspelled?  Yes or no?
How about "Kurakis"?  "Hooh"?  "Zexlar"?  Yes or no?
(These are all EQ names I've pulled at random from my logs.)

Is "star" a misspelling of "rats"?  Or just a different word
formed by the same letters transposed?  How about "arts"?
"Tsar"?  Now try this one:  "Srat".  What is that a misspelling
of?  What is it a correct spelling of?  What *is* it?
Hmm, is it the "gray area"?

Where have I denied that?

Here you're stretching.

Is a character named "Buck" a misspelling of "Fuck"?  Or is it
in the "close but not quite" category?

I'd accept that "Biggoll Tiddies" would clearly be a misspelling of
the naughty phrase in question.  But once the alteration reaches
the point where the reader has to go, "ok, if you
remove this part here, and move it over there, and replace
this part which I put back into the original spot I removed
something from then..." I maintain that you've gone way beyond
"misspellings".  It's a build-it-yourself naughty-phrase kit,
perhaps, but it's not a "misspelling" in my book.

There are better words for alterations like that, and "misspelling"
is a piss-poor one to use for them, for otherwise you're
stretching the nice, useful word "misspelling" into covering
damned near *anything*, including "watermelon" as an
alleged "misspelling" of "lemon".  It's stretching it too far.

Your mileage may differ, but I believe I still have a valid
point.
