Personally i'll give DaoC the same requirements as EQ before i'd play 
it. It must have become stable, it must have become mature and it must
have developed a community. So i'll consider playing DaoC based on it's
condition in 1-2 years. And if it doesn't build a community to sustain
it that long then I know it wasn't worth it.

Neither of these are true I believe.

The relic, where they not currently in their second round of being
bugged, will give +5% magic damage or +5% melee damage to the holding
realm (2 relics). They don't subtract from the realms power directly
because they know there'll be an absolute whine explosion from the
hibernian realm which is widely considered under-powered as it is.

Even with both relics from both realms the winning realm will only
have +10% to damage. A nice bonus, but considering how fragile
players are unlikely to make a huge difference to who wins or loses
a battle. Especially because the group that holds the relics 
probably has a number/level advantage anyway.

Mythic has also not yet demonstrated how they can keep RvR dynamic
and exciting. It will be interesting to see what developments they
take in this regard.
