If it is like the 98 and XP task schedulers (since posting yesterday, it
occured to me that I have Win98 installed via VMWare on my Linux box, so I
could look at the 98 scheduler), when you get to the dialog with the
"Finish" button in the Scheduled Task Wizard, check "Open advanced
properties for this task when I click Finish", or, alternatively, bring up
the context menu on the task after you create it and select "Properties".

There should be a "settings" tab there.  One of the options there is to stop
the scheduled task after a specified number of hours and minutes.

So, if you could arrange for EQ to depend on something that was started via
a scheduled task, you could have the task schedular kill that after a
specified amount of time, thus taking out EQ.  Sounds like a job for EQW.
:-)

Whether that will work or not depends on how the task schedular tries to
stop tasks, and whether EQW responds to that method.  Someone will have to
experiment.
