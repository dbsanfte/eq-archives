But it seems they never test *anything* adequately. They made changes to the
Shaman epic. If they'd taken the time to actually test-drive a Shammy epic
for a few minutes, I think the difference between a DoT and a HoT would have
become immediately apparent. The players certainly noticed really fast!

The standard operating procedure seems to be at least one "emergency" patch
to fix glaring errors in that day's/week's patch. That does not indicate a
great deal of diligence is being executed in the development and testing
process, in my opinion.

Not all of the errors introduced by patches and their subsequent emergency
patches have been as glaring as this mistake with the Shammy epic, but it's
part of a general downward trend in the quality of the software. Emergency
patches used to be rare, now they're anticipated (often with dread).
