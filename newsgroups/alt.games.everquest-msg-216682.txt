Yes, NBG works fine with friends, its in Pickup groups where it
tends to collapse

Pick any given target and I'll bet you there are some classes for
which nothing useful drops.  Even if the mix is perfect and
there's something for everyone, surely once you've done the
target a few times you'll start seeing people in your guild that
already have whatever they might hope to get... what keeps them
coming, when NBG guarantees they won't be seeing any drops as
long as there's someone else in the guild that needs the item
they already have?  Loyalty for one thing, but most guilds also
reward those people who are attending but not getting anything
with preference on later drops.
