Okay, then you *also* need a video card update, just to get
decent framerates.

*However*, your post gave the strong impression that you could
play your Druid before you used dialup, but after using dialup
he was unplayable due to "lag and LD".  If you're getting significantly
more datarate lag (as per the green "lag bar" on the upper left of
your screen -- press F11 to enable it if you've got it turned off),
as opposed to *framerate* lag (they are two very distinct phenomena,
which people muddle by calling both "lag"), and more LDs, then
you also most probably have a winmodem issue.

Switching from cablemodem to dialup alone should not make
*any* noticeable difference in your Everquest playability,
with the exception of longer zoning times if you're entering
a zone with a lot of PCs in it.

The fact that you made a point of mentioning your
modem switch seems to be saying that it *did*, and if so
that points to a modem issue (over and above your "my
framerates have always sucked" issue).
