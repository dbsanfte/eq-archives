At 26 my necro was up in Great divide and hunted tizmaks, was like i
killed 2 then died, killed 3 then died :(

When i dinged 29 i did go back, my newest darkness was resisted madly
but once i dinged 30 (now 1 orange + into the level) it worked a lot
better, not shure about EW though, the tizmaks range from 25 - 31 and
at 30 it seems that only the furious tizmak warriors con yellow,
usually skip them because of resists, even when blue they resist like
crazy, they usually drop from nothing to velium weapon, tizmak armor
and a rune(had that drop from 1 timzak) weapons sells for 4pp armor
usually for around 2.5pp

I love this zone since there is a big number of mobs that i can choose
from, entry is tizmaks i guess, then i can move on to feral cave
kodiaks(killed 2 so far), also have drakkel wolfs for faction agains
the giants, frost giants for same faction, and you have shardwurms
that drop spells, at least the higher level ones, town is close to
bank, sell or work on tradeskills.

Ohh i and did i mention that at 30 i'm usually the lowest level in the
zone :)
