    I copied the lobby scene music from the matrix over one of the mp3's for
combat music, the result was nothing whatsoever in game (eq actually loads
all the mp3's into memory when it loads up... no wonder its got such a huge
footprint with ram usage practises like that <disgusted look>) and the game
proceeded to overwrite it with the original next time i loaded it up and
patched it. Reckon I could get it to work by letting it patch, copying over,
then hitting "play" but can't be stuffed. Can always just play whatever for
combat with the in-game mp3 player.

Cheers,
James
