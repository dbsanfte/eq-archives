My suggestions:
Get bound in Qeynos and play there. Much better "newbie" area.   Buy food and
water either at Sneeds Trading Post or Voleens bakery.  
Kill bats and save the wings.  Higher players will pay 2 to 5 plat per stack
for them.  
Save the snake eggs, they are food.  
Set up a hot key for "sense heading", "taunt" and "forage".  Hit them all the
time.  All the time.  This will help advance your skill in them.  And have one
set up for "location" too.  You don't want to lose your corpse when you die.  
Don't buy armor or weapons from vendors.  Once you get a few plat do a
"/auction want to buy low level ranger armor / weapons  please send tell".
