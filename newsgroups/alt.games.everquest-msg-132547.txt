I have no idea why they have the 1000 there.  Maybe anything after 1000 is
ignored?  i.e. 1498AC = 1000AC ?

Well, in the new interface, at least you can get numerical percentages of
mana.  I agree... I can't see the sense in not displaying the numerical
value of mana, especially when they tell you the mana cost of each spell.

Perhaps they are trying, somewhat half-assedly (there's a word!) to keep people
from number crunching so much and just play the game.
