If they attacked it, you might have started accusing them of kill
stealing.  If a mob is engaged with another character, you are _not_
supposed to help unless specifically asked to, it's considered rude
(because if you kill it, you get the exp and they get nothing).  You
might ask "Do you need help?", but most people won't unless the person
being attacked looks to be in trouble, because it's a waste of time,
expecially when that person has already expressed a lack of interest
in grouping.

Now, from a role-playing standpoint, this is completely ridiculous
unless we assume everyone follows som sort of code that says they have
to take care of their problems with no assistance, but it's how the
game works.
