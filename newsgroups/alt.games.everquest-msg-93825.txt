When all is said and done, this is probably the most effective way to
get a positive response. I know it works on Tiru *really* well. Grouped
in the Hole, we ran into an enchanter who was soloing down there a bit
below us. She had died. (Nobody wants to take an xp loss death at 55,
face it.) Only about five of us in the freaking zone, and it's off peak
hours so they may not have had any free guild clerics online for all I
know. Well, a person that takes the time to drag their own corpse right
up near the cleric, politely asks if a rez might be possible next time
the group takes a break, and THEN proceeds to dump their best clarity on
the casters and best haste on the melee (our group having no chanter)
while they wait....

You can probably understand how the offer of a gratuity for the rez was
refused, and the rez was done promptly at the end of our next spawn
cycle. Everyone's happy.
