Ok, first best bet (IMO) is to wait till a different time of day, log
on, and see if that GM is *not* online and a different one is, and
/petition again.
  The rules cited by Georg are certainly correct, but even *if* that's
the basis being used by the Guide in question, it's a stretch and a
nitpick all at once of those rules. To the "everyman on the street"
view, the rule about not using "l", "d", etc. is to stop people from
using them as a corrupted, slang English version of "the". (e.g. trying
to get "Bob d'Basher", corrupted version of "Bob the Basher". Clearly a
violation.) Given that your requested name is in French, and that's just
common name structure in French, and not some sneaky way for you to get
around the rules, the GM was being a prick.  I think your name selection
was totally find, where as "Heartad'Eagle" would be rejected.
  My monk's surname is probably highly petitionable, as it not only
incorporates the optional use of an accent mark and multiple capital
letters, but makes a corrupted mispelled sentence. But the GM passed it
anyway and give it to me without batting an eye. Yours should be cake.
Keep trying. You'll get a better GM.
