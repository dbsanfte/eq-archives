This isn't often true of 40M, though, for most groups in most
normal situations, 40M is more than you'll go thru on any given
pull.  I'd agree with you if you said "10% M", where quite often
you'll need more than that at the beginning of a large pull.

More to the point, though, I -do- feel that more mana in the pool
is better than less mana in the pool all things being equal, but
not because its critical to normal pulls, rather that it leaves
you ready for bad pulls or LDs or resists or other unexpected
emergencies.

This is not because you might need more for normal situations,
quite the reverse, its because you need Less for normal
situations, so there's no need to go down to 40M in the first
place, since you'll be maintaining some average mana level
(swinging back and forth across it as one pull needs more mana
than usual and another needs a bit less), you might as well
maintain one that gives you a better emergency pool.

Thats a good point, if there's no CC in place especially, killing
the first mob fast means the group takes less damage overall;
this is the same reason melee generally all concentrate on one
mob instead of offtanking them all.

As long as you don't keep so large a reserve that you end up FM
at some points, this is true... but part of my point here is that
that doesnt' effect how much nuking the druid can do over the run
of the hour; keeping roughly 80m and keeping roughly 40m both
allow the use of the same amount of mana in the long run, which
is to say exactly as much as you can regen in that hour.

There are some complex factors to consider here: the melee DPS
part of the group suffers any time there's no mob being hit, but
its not relevant to healer mana how quickly or slowly the damage
comes in to the melee, a healer can heal only so many HP per
hour, whether its in constant fight or in larger fights with med
breaks in between.  But with nukers available, its better to have
more mana available for each fight, so that mobs die faster, thus
reducing the damage they do.

I think that there are several variables, but that we can come up
with general guidelines that encompass them all, and this
conversation is working in that direction.

One suggestion is that rather than everything boiling down to
mana regen, that mana regen is a major component for most groups
in the efficient use of time, and that this efficient use of time
is the real key.

I'm not sure that's as helpful in thinking about how to balance
things as it might be, in a way "mana regen" is a good
generalization that is more useful for most groups, just as
Kepler's orbital mechanics are much more useful than Einstein's
General Relativity despite the latter being much closer to
"correct"

I agree that running with more than 60M is a good plan, but
recent conversations in another thread make it clear that this
concept isnt' self evident; what I'm pointing out is that since
40M and 60M and 80M aren't really important in terms of how many
mobs you can kill in an hour (mana regen and the other factors in
"time" are), that the choice of what to average or stay above is
really just one of safety margin and of avoiding the FM
condition.
