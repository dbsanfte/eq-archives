the issue is that load times have increased dramatically.
Previous to Luclin I loaded in ~10 seconds.  Now it takes
upwards of a minute.  My harddrive is a 7200rpm 30gig/ATA
100.  Short of going to a raid system, it's not getting
substantially faster.

as a side note, Kunark zones take significantly longer
than old world zones or Luclin zones to load.
