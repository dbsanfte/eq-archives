I'm on ISDN, not technically broadband (The FCC defines broadband internet
as a sustained transfer rate of 150kbps or faster). Even when I was on dial
up (26.4k dialup) I zoned faster than 70% of the people I know.

That being said, I think you'd be slitting your throat to require broadband,
unless you were ready to compete with the big boys. The niche market games
are not going to make the money (remember, bandwidth costs money too, and
like many other things you need to be buying it by the 55 gallon drum rather
than by the bucket to get a decent price on it. I work for an ISP, and when
we still did T1's it was much more expensive per byte than our T3 is.)

I don't know what the current market penetration of 'broadband' in the US
is... early last year I saw it was up to a whopping mid 30%s.
