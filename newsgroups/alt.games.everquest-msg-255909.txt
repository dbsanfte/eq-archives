Why?  Cast em on yourself, take a look at the duration, write it down, 
no brain work involved.

Before the patch letting us see durations, this would indeed have 
required that you actually work up a sweat in your grey matter... but no 
longer!

Good to know, how about vary-by-level actual effects?  For example, does 
  KEI cast by a level 65 give any more mana per tic (I think it doesn't, 
but how about other buffs?)

But why would they want to know?  I mean, other than the p*nis measuring 
contest factor of it, who cares what bloody gear and AA the buff whore 
has, just tell me how long it will last dambit!

The 120 minute one.  Why? Because I want to encourage listing by time, 
rather than by outdated %.  And assuming that listing by time catches 
on, later I'll go for the one that listed by time because listing by % 
suggests to me the guy is lying and hoping I won't know enough to see 
that his duration doesn't match up to the % extension he claimed.

And because I know that 120 minutes is a couple hours, while I have no 
idea whether 45% extended is an hour or three... and my natural paranoia 
is going to vote in favor of it being the hour!  A couple hours, thats a 
fine duration for any buff.
