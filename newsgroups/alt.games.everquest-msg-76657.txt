I'm not a LGuk kid, I'm a SolB kid.  I get lost in LGuk STILL, unless I'm
just going to Ass/Sup.  I know how to get to the safe hall but that's it.
If I wander around I can usually find all the camps, though I don't know
which camps I've stumbled upon unless they happen to be up. :)

That being said, and pardon my ignorance, but where else can you go with one
group to get that QUALITY of loot?  Ignorance being...do any of those
critters drop anything worth more than 100p?  If there's good loot and
someone wants one of the camps I think they're entitled to it even if that
means downtime for me.  When my group was camping for the damned robe for
the enchanter quest (can't remember who drops) we were farming about 3 other
places.  I had no problem giving up one of those places to a group that
requested it.
