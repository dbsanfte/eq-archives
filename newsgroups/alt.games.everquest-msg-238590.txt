Hit ctrl-v, then the statistics button.

Adventure merchant in the camps

Wild guess would be the guy with the words "adventure recruiter"
floating over his head in the camp.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ is the best site for general EQ info.
You don't have to sign up for their premium service to get all the
info, by the way. It just removes the ads and gives you far more
refined search options and other conveniences. The info's all
available either way, though.
