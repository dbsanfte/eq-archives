Until I get a connection working it doesn't make a lot of sense to buy
an expansion... particularly given SOE's long standing habit of
dramatically reducing the price a while after release (well its not
just SOE, its industry wide, but SOE does tend to adhere to it)

Course -if- I was online I'd happily pay the release price in order to
get in on the fun while its still fresh, as I've done for every
expansion except ROK, and regret not having bought ROK immediately.
