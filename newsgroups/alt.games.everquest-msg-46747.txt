As a note, you will most likely die before you can inject Atropine into
yourself, even if it is sitting in your hand. And unless you have a full
NBC suit, that gas mask isn't going to be too useful. Your body breathes
constantly and therefore anything released into the air is going to
eventually be inhaled by your skin cells. You'd probably be better off
without a gas mask than to die slowly from a chemical attack.

Actually, the idea is that you get out of the area and then consume the
MRE. Most modern MRE's come in packaging that make the term "Stay fresh
forever" seem like child's play. The odds of an MRE being damaged in an
NBC style attack is pretty low (Given that you're not at ground zero). The
idea is that the soldier will get the heck out of the area if he has to
eat. Of course, not many people stand around inside a contaminated area
tempting fate, unless they have a real want for danger.

Wake up call? Who the hell here was asleep? Did you honestly think that
something like this would never happen? Sheesh.
