Actually that's exactly the way it works. I can take a red pixel, even
if it appears in a copyrighted work and draw an entire picture with
it, making 10 million copies.

Intellectual property applies to a 'greater' work. The little
unrecognizable bits are not copy protected.

"Kids in school" are not an original work of authorship. I can name a
dozen books which use that idea. (The Great Brain, Adventures of the
Bailey School Kids, Lizzie McGuire, The Kids of Polk Street School...)

EQ plat is no different. *Even* if I did make a little grey circle and
called it plat, and incorporated it into an otherwise unrelated game
they'd have no case. Its not protected.

But selling plat for $$$ isn't even doing that. Copyright simply has
no bearing on the issue.
