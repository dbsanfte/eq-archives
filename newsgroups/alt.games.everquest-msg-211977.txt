If you run out of mana, you aren't using "Sustained" DPS, you are using "burst"
DPS.  Sustained DPS means what you can do at your mana regen rate.  This does
mean that one of the components of the question is "with what mana regen
available" just as for melee damage the question "with what haste available" is
a key question.  Other components of nuker DPS are average damage per nuke and
cycle time on the nuke and how much nuking you can do in a row without getting
unwanted aggro.

Quad kiting is an interesting aside, but if we want to count quadding then I bet
my cleric had a higher DPS at level 59 than any quadding wizard you ever met...
when I was part of an AOE group and dropping 3/4ths my mana bar (what was left
over after healing during the buildup) into PB AE nukes hitting 60 mobs at
once.  Of course the wizards in my group were outdamaging me by a factor of 10
on those same mobs... but I only said I could beat the quadders.  Neither the
wizards nor my cleric were doing sustained DPS though, we were dropping our mana
bars just as fast as we possibly could, playing "beat the clock" against the
enchanter's ability to keep those 60 mobs all stunned continuously.  Hmm, I
wonder, if you took our damage and averaged it out to take into account the time
to med back up to full... I bet our "sustained" DPS still beat any other form of
sustained DPS all hollow.

Necros mages and beastlords all do pretty amazing damage because they can get
serious pets out and supplement them with serious damage production on their
own.  All melee benefit from positioning to such an extent that the question of
where they are standing is paramount to the question of what their DPS is,
rogues, mages and necros all benefit far more though due to the force multiplier
of backstab.

Thats an excellent point, the question is so open ended as to be unanswerable.
Heck, I could make a case for cleric being the highest DPS class... and we all
know thats ridiculous.
