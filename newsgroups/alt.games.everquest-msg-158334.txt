Smarter than the average bear?  :-)

Seriously though,  they had to know that some large percentage of players
would never spell this right...  why not just go ahead and call it Clarity
3?  Or even better, "Polar Bear's Unlimited Brainpower"

(For the sarcasm impaired:  I realize that the name of the spell is Koadic's
Endless Intellect.  This is just a commentary on the [in my opinion]
absurdity of that name.)
