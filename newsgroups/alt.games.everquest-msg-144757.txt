I wanted to say there are both idiots and interesting people in 
various proportions in every country. In France, America, and lots 
of other ones. And these various proportions may change again if 
you only focus on EQ players.
It is impossible to say that French are dumb players or that 
Americans are, or anything of this kind.

I said age is a more accurate criterion to differentiate players, 
but still not the most accurate.

Sorry for my grammar, I also have lots of difficulties to read 
clearly all your posts, sometimes I must give up because I am 
unable to catch the meaning of the posts. I only learned academic 
English and I lost most of my vocabulary with years.

Do not hesitate to ask me to repeat or make different sentences if 
you don't understand my post, it will also help me to get better. 
:)
