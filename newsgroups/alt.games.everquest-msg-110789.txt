Exactly.  So take a level 5 warrior, max their defense, run a control set. 
Give them a full set of armor, do the exact same test again.  The *only*
variable that changed is AC, and you can legitimately claim to *prove*
something.

"few"  Thus making his test pointless and *utterly* inconclusive.

Interesting?  Perhaps.  Valid, conclusive, reliable...  not hardly.

No, I'm saying that "common knowledge" suggests that the variables he
*wasn't* controlling are a *bigger* impact... umm, I'm not gonna repeat
that, it was plain english.

But, again, "common knowledge" suggests that level is the single biggest
factor in damage mitigation.  So "unexpectedly" is hardly the appropriate
word there.


>And if you still don't get it, mate, there's no hope. :)

Perhaps I do.  Perhaps this wasn't actually meant to be a *serious* test, or
a "test" at all for that matter.  In which case, it is pretty pointless to
continue in this discussion from any side, as I have no interest at all in
tests with no legitimate basis.
