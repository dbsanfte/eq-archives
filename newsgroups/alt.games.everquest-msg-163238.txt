Well, as a necro you will have zero downtime except when things go
wrong.  Like you have an add, or you get 3+ resists in a tough spot,
etc.  When you are soloing as a necro you offset your potential downtime
by just not killing as fast.  Always keep your hp>mana spell on (unless
you are FM...), especially as an iksar.

For example, when root/dotting, you dont apply everything you *could*
apply.  Select 2 of your most efficient dots (or perhaps just darkness
for the snare component and one other dot) and just med while they run
their course, and repeat as needed.  I guess this wont apply to you for
a while, but the concept applies now I think.

They should be above humans, just from a stats and infravision
perspective.  They dont get an xp bonus, however.  I just hate gnomes
and halflings and my biased showed a little there.

If you plan on researching your own spells (a questionable decision give
the bazaar and the availability of all of your researchable spells),
then you should just use your level up trains to raise it 5 per level.
This is what I did but this was pre-Kunark when it wasnt as easy as it
is now to find people selling the spells, or the components, for
reasonable prices.  Now, I'd just buy the spells off of players
personally.
