Similar. I'm running with textures on high, and all the models except (I
think) two turned on. Didn't bother with ogres or gnomes. Hated the
look. Running good in all the zones I've been in so far, including old
world. Haven't been into Fungus or The Grey or a couple cities yet, but
it's not bad. I have:
P3-600
512 MB RAM
GF2 MX 400 Video 64 MB RAM
dx8.1
Win 98SE

(So Brad, how's the job hunt going? <g>)
