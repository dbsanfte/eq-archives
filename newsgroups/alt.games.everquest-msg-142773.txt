    The new direct healing spells, since they heal for more, will attract
more aggro. I doubt it'll be terribly noticeable, though. The group heal is
less aggro on paper, but given that you'd be casting it earlier I imagine it
would again be a wash. I'm spoiled by having tanks with Enraging Blow
weapons and AoE Taunt, but by the time I cast WoR the mob is locked on the
main tank and nothing is moving it. I don't see either being much help in XP
situations, even against things like those AoE rain lizards in CT, because
if your squishy party members take 1 K damage they need heals now to stay
out of low health aggro range, and not 24 seconds from now.

    Where the aggro management would come into play would be on lower-level
raids, like people doing Kunark dragons or Western Wastes stuff. There you
won't have a tank with enraging blow weapons, and being able to heal without
the aggro of CH would be important. But the spell is currently tagged level
60, when people doing that stuff will likely be lower than that.

    Nope. Would have been a good addition to the druid arsenal.

    I bought Pokey the Pony when our guild was gearing up for Vex Thal
because we were told we could use horses to med there. Then someone found
out that horses could bring down the entire place on us if someone got Grav
Fluxed in the wrong place. Since the movement on a horse makes me mildly
motion sick, Pokey got turned into glue.
