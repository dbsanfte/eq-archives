Dear Verant:

Rangers receive very little respect in the world of Norrath, and for very 
good reason.  We are no better armored than a thief, are spells are 
minimal in damage, and warriors are better with the bow than we are.  
Seemingly there are no positives to our class.  The main reason so 
many play rangers is that they enjoy the roleplay that comes along with 
the class.  I saw a poll that voted rangers 66% as the most broken class.

Apparently you intend for the ranger to be an archer-type class that is 
lightly armored and fleet-footed.  However, every (literally every) 
ranger I have talked to states that archery is not a viable form of 
fighting mobs due to the way it is currently implemented.

Here are a few modest improvements that you might consider making to the 
ranger class to make it more desirable among groups, since grouping is 
what EQ is all about and currently rangers are not very desired among 
groups, especially at higher levels:

1.  Archery damage output should be higher than a warriors since 
apparently rangers are suppose to be more of an archery-class rather than 
hand-to-hand (which is why you are making them lightly armored and 
fleet-footed).  People should say in the world of Norrath "rangers are 
the best archers" so that rangers at least can feel proud of this skill.  
Some rangers say they have dueled warriors by archery alone and the 
warriors win.  Rangers are not wanted on plane-raids since at that level 
they have the lowest damage output yet still not tank like a warrior.  
One would think that the flip-side of not being able to tank would mean 
rangers could deal more damage, but that is not the case with rangers.

2.  Introduce some more powerful arrows that only rangers can use and are 
cost-efficient.  Perhaps some novel trick arrows such as exploding 
arrows, stun arrows, or the like.

3.  Arrow-recovery can allow rangers to recover a percentage of the 
arrows they spent during a fight.  At higher levels of fletching the 
arrows get very very expensive.  Currently it is impossible to carry 
enough arrows to fight for a day.

4.  Archery engine should be improved so that the mob can still be hit as 
long as it is visible -- vertical distances or slight obstruction of 
their body should not prevent shooting them.  It is discouraging shooting 
several arrows at a mob just to realize the engine will not allow it to 
be hit, even though it is in plain sight.

5.  Fletching should be a ranger class skill, just as poison is a thief 
class skill.  That way even if some poor beginning ranger makes the silly 
mistake of making a different skill his primary one, he can still become 
a master of fletching.  Every long-term ranger is eventually going to 
want to go all the way in fletching, especially if you improve the 
rangers archery skill.

These improvements are so simple to implement and would involve little 
coding.  Does Verant plan on improving the ranger class?  If so, could 
you please comment publicly as to what plans you have for the class.

Verant's job is not done in this area until you start hearing group 
leaders discuss their plans in the manner of "Okay, lets have the tank 
beat on the mob while the cleric heals, the thief backstabs, the wizard 
blasts and the ranger turns it into a pincushion."

Once more:  rangers are accurately assessed by most high-level groups as 
someone that takes xp from the group without contributing any damage.  
This needs fixed.
