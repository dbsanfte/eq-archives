Shazam! Here i appear, you just had to rub the lamp.

It was me, not ryou.

Actually it was out of kindness it spoke about google.

You just had mentioned vietnam as an example of france "pulling shit" (your
expression), and were using it as an argument to back usa's goverment
position on irak.

If you don't like googlesque, i can use "ridiculous" or "ludicrous", but i
guess you already got the picture anyways?

About your other points :

No it's cool. It's fun. It's the trendy thing these days. It's not really
hatred after all. Woopee.

And that explain why bush wasted in a matter of month the wordwide sympathy
caused by the attack on the wtc, to become the perceived biggest threat to
the world.

Can't be that his politic is bad can it? It must be something else.

So you have "terror alert levels" on tv, duct tape in your cellar, and
acceptable french hatred.

A bit of anxiety, a bit of hatred, some soldiers with their lives
endangered, a good dose of patriotism, and people will be just fine.

Mean people in power of course. Enron anyone? Remember enron? no?

Lol.

I propose "compassionate imperialism".

Or has it been used already?


> I think they are weaking the United Nations,

Let's ask Blix who weaken them?


> the European
> Union,

Some goverment followed us on irak, none of them, afaik,  with the assent of
the people.

If you ask the people in the streets, europe is pretty much united on irak.
As is the rest of the world.


>and the War on Terror.

Oh, caps.

You're a republican no? :-)

Your "War on Terror" -caps give that aura thing to things, like You Don't
Precisely Know What It Means But It Looks Important, they should use it more
on the left side-  is bush's next presidential campaign.

You know : you'll have to reelect him, or the war on terror (mean War on
Terror) will be stopped by the whiny democrat, and the "terror level alert"
will rise again.

Even if you are yourself in this "i'm going to save the world, so let me do
what i want" trip, you can't reasonably ask people from other countries to
follow you.

You mean a minority in texas?

Nono. Being so obvious breaks it all. To do it right, you have to _imply_
french are cheese eating surrendering monkeys, not flatly state it.

Better attempt at it than your previous posts, though -if i may dare be
judge.


> I don't consider this racism or ethnic hatred.

Me neither. I consider it's a ham-and-gherkins sandwich with a few slices of
emmenthaler.

Muddying?

None of the terrorist of the wtc were irakian.
80% of them where saudis. Saudis, like saudi arabia, usa's best pals in
middle east, permanent member of the axis of buddies, and full of oil.

Muddy? The hypocritical lamentations about the conditions of living of the
average iraki, when usa has enforced the embargo on irak for years?
Prohibiting even fucking medicine to pass through? Millions of irakis died,
and saddam was only strenghtened.

Muddy? The usa invading the whole country last time, between 100 000 and 300
000 died, and well, finally, leaving saddam in place? Out of kindness fro
that jolly fellow?

Muddy? Usa first client of saddam for oil? Cheapo oil, too, a country under
embargo usually is begging you to buy.


And on top of this, this ridiculous discourse about the duty of the usa
"taking it's responsabilities" -and the oil.

... French "hubris" and "hypocrisy". Yeah right.
