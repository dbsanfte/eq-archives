Not sure how much blame the guild shares in that instance. The people
I know in serious raid guilds will either do LDoN at times when
there's no chance of a raid being called or make it clear ahead of
time that they might have to bail and then let the group decide
whether they want them or not. 

Everyone should have the decency not to put himself into the position
where they might have to leave w/o warning for a raid in the middle of
a LDoN. Best you can do in that situation is to put then on your list
of 'self-absorbed idiots that I won't group with again'.
