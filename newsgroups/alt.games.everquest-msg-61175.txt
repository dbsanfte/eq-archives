About as good as you can get as a two hander for now. No 1hd? The MoSS I
have seen for as low as 600pp on Bristlebane 19/29 1hb.

> Face =  Lizardskin Tribal Mask
Sarnak Hide Mask dropped in KC but sell for 6 - 800pp now

> Neck = Ringmail Neckplate
Rygorr Collar or Spider Fur Collar...the Rygorr you could get yourself in a
group (Rygorr fort in EW) the spiderfur is from  Velks so a little out of
your range, cost about 1k. I actually prefer the Rygorr (1 less AC but with
sta and MR and +10mana)

> Head = Drakforge Helmet
Nothing wrong with that, maybe a sentient helm for little more AC but lose
some resists

> R Ear = Obsidian Bead Hoop
> L Ear = Gold Ear Stud
Orc Fang earings or, better yet,  Cougar claw. Orc fangs from Rygorrs in EW
Velious, Cougar claws from, surprising, cougars (several zones in velious
Iceclad and EW at least...maybe more)

> R finger = Adamantite Band
> L Finger = Adamantite Band
Ewww -10 MR... Jagged Bands at the least here, (ac5 +3str) if you can afford
them then player made platinum or velium fire wedding rings (+5ac +55hp and
+6ac +65hp respectively)

> R Wrist = Darkforge Bracer
> L Wrist = Giant Scalemail Bracer
Crustacian Bracers are very good, imo, 9ac +5str +4sta -4cha...dropped in
cobalt scar..you are a little low for them yet but they sell for around
500pp or less otherwise Hero bracers.

> Arms = Darkforge Vambraces
> Hands = Darkforge Gauntlets
> Sholder = Bloodstained Mantel
Crested Spaulders, from MM...you shouldn't have a problem there with a full
group, they often sell for around 50pp as well. 11ac and +5 sta

> Chest = Darkforge Breastplate
Sounds fine to me, my SK still wears one at a similar level. EBP drops in
lower guk 5 more AC but you'd be losing the stats that the DF give you (10
Stamina!)

> Back = Small Banded Cloak
Dire wolf hide cloak from this quest
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=976
Spider fur cloak from velks (around 1kpp) prolly the best available to you
is Hooded Black Cloak from MM. Otherwise a supple black cloak from Runnyeye
is an improvement in AC.

> Waist = A Think Leather Apron        Black Alloy Girdle same AC and + Sta
from Runnyeye
or TBB if you really need some strength (and can afford the 3k asking price
nowadays)

> Legs = Darkforge Greaves
> Feet = Darkforge Boots
Again no arguements, sentient is the other choice but I'd say that was
better for the cerebrally challenged SK's (trolls and ogres) as a Dark Elf
you are not likely short of intelligence. The Sentient boots do offer 1 more
AC.

I haven't suggested any shields as you don't seem to use one...I'd say if
you need one in a rush you can prolly by a velium round shield (ac15) for
50pp or get a Cracked Darkwood yourself from High Pass.
Obvious choice would be Sarnak Battle or Clay Guardian shields.
