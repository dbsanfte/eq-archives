 From failed intimidate to kill, 1 minute 36 seconds, even con mob. 
Given the time to go from 80% to 90%, figure another 2 minutes to 
recover the lost hp without binding wounds (which of course I could only 
really do if I'd done this several times in a row so my hp was under 70% 
and I patched back up to that mark)

 From mob attack to kill, 43 seconds... on a greenie!  Admittedly most 
of that was because he ran at such high health he was moving pretty 
fast, and then he stopped up on a slope and I couldn't get a good 
position to hit him with for a while.
