That's where I go to hunt for spider silks.  Problem is of course, not 
being a tracker, I have to actually see the spiders to kill them.  I also 
go there for pelts, that is easier as I can at least sense animals.  
Admittedly I've done a lot more spiderling silk farming than spider silk 
farming, and the drop rate on that was below 2 per spiderling on average 
in Feerott which seemed to be the best spiderling silk farming location.
