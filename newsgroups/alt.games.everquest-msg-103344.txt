Well, it was a raid for a member of your guild, that ended
up "picking up" a few people that eventually wiped out due
to Fay ping-ponging around.

Then Fay didn't depop OR path to the butt-whupping
Master-guy...so many folks had to end up summoning
corpses just to get gear back.

It was a pain, but still fun in the end.  I went LD that night
while waiting on a corpse summon, and then again a few
hours later standing over the body of Coercer Q'uiol.  I'd
already looted the Kedge, and saw my numbers go red.
I just remember thinking "Please let the game save the
fact that I have this damn robe..."
