You seem to have lost your perspective and are confusing possibities
with probabilities. 

If look back at the title of this thread and reflect - I think/hope
you will agree that there are settings and checks available to you to
give you reasonable confidence that all is OK here. For someone like
you, you can check the certifications etc.

For  someone like me - who needs a slightly lower burden of proof I am
also satisfied, without the need to call up RSA to confirm that they
did actually issue the certificate!! (or would your call be
intercepted by the CIA and they could only be pretending to be RSA -
its possible, but probable?).

I would venture to suggest that your connection to the Internet to
read these posts - even with your firewall's and routers etc - makes
you more susceptible than the EQBete Activx - as long as you do the
most rudimentary check.

Of course - you are quite entitled to your opinion - but I dont think
it is unreasonable for Sony to do what they have done. Ultimately ,
its your choice, take it or leave it.

Cheers
