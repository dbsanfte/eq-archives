Oh the days after the release of LoY, when everyone played frogloks
and sold everything they looted in the newbie area to the vendors.  I
hit up all the merchants in innothule and gukta for spiderling silk
and managed to turn that into 8k in the bazaar.

Now, since that wasn't terribly helpful for the original poster:

At level 15 I was able to make a couple hundred pp in an hour or two
of hunting wisps in Erud's crossing.  If you're a little higher, say
level 20, you can supplement that by killing those spiders for silk,
because they're plentiful drops from those spiders.  I wouldn't advise
taking them on solo when they're blue, because they're social and that
poison is a little nastier than you would expect from a spider that
level.
