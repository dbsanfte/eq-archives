Description of AGI:
"Agility affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how
difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when
you are hit."
If you are agile, you can easier move your body so you avoid damage.

If you are encumbered by weight or through extensive injuries,
movement becomes more difficult. You run slower, and you can't move
your body as fast and easily. You slow down, and your AGI stat drops,
but the one doesn't cause the other: they're both consequences of
impeded movement ability.

Comprende?
