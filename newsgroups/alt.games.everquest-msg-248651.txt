Except, if they're going to go to the work of creating a new quest,
why would they want to make it available for only a week or month?
Sure, it ceases to be fresh for people who've seen it already, but
there are new players joining all the time, so why not leave it
there for them?  What's gained by removing it?  So really this is
the same as asking for more content in existing zones, and they've
done some of that (e.g. newbie armor quests).

On the other hand, a "visitor" could work.  Suppose they added some
quests that involve NPCs who occasionally get moved to different
zones?  (The zones would always be appropriate to level of the quest,
or at least places where that level of player might travel.)  So to
do the quest you have to find out where the NPC is this week, and
then find him before he moves again.  Or, more to the point, people
might start travelling through more zones in the hope of encountering
one of these "wandering" NPCs.

I also think it would help if there were more NPCs who initiated
conversations.  Sure, there are some NPC merchants who hawk their
wares, or NPC trainers offering advice to NPC trainees.  But I've
yet to run into a mob wandering around a zone and have the mob
accost me, not to attack, but to ask for (or insist on!) help.
Having the world be a bit more active, in ways other than just
attacking KOS targets, would be a good step.

Not that I expect them to put that sort of effort into EQ at this
point, though.  I'd be happy if they'd just fix the existing bugs!
