They ought to just have the stupid NPC trainers explain this oddity
to every caster when they give the "You have learned the basics of..."
message for specialization.  It's one of the goofiest skill mechanics
in the game, and as far as I know there is <no> in-game explanation of
it.  If you don't go to a spoiler site or forum/newsgroup you are not
very likely to figure it out on your own.
