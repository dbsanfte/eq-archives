No, I don't think you understand.  When I make a Gold Cat Eye Bracelet for
example, the component part are about 11p.  I can go to a vendor and get a
little less than that, like 10.7 pp.  But with a Gold Geode Ring the base
value of the metal bar alone is 10.5 pp, but I get offered only 2 g.p. for
the whole frigging ring, despite the player based setting of prices on the
geode.
