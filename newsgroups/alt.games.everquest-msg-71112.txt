I dont know how many of you makes notes while playing, such as important
locs, quest infomation, etc. but when I do it, when I need the information
again I can never find it (Im very disorganised (.
I have found a way to take notes within the game, using socials. Just
program your notes into one of your social pages, I use 10 for quests, and 9
for locs.
I use the format (for example) ":knows that the zone from LOIO to FM is at
XXX,XXX", or ":knows that you need 2 gnoll pelts and 1 gnoll skin for the
orange headband". It also looks kewl when someone asks you about a quest or
loc you have programmed).
"Koochulainn knows you need 2 gnoll pelts and 1 gnoll skin for the orange
headband"

I hope this helps other peeps who cant keep their notes in order.
