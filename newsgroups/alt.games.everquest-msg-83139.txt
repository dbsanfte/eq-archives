I've had another experience bug bite me.  Twice I have seen my experience
bar just stop moving.  The first time it happened I assumed the the bar
graphic was just messed up and it would be fixed the next time I camped.
No such luck, lost two hours of play that time.   Couple of months later
same thing happened.  I quickly logged and got it going again.

My advice is to watch your bar like a hawk and if it stops moving for an
extended period of time, camp and relog.
