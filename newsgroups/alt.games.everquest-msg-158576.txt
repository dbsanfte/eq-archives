Do what pleases you most. I do 50-50, personally, for my necro. My cleric is
on 100% regular xp until he gets his clicky or 56 for the 96% rez. Then
he'll think about spliting it other ways.

Many folks do this. Jakiss plans to do this. He did switch over and get Run
Speed 3, but is now concentrating on getting to level 60 before doing any
