Considering that the main problem with FV is low player count I would
guess the best way to ensure groups is to be able to travel. So a druid
would be good :-P

Seriously, there seems to be a bit of a lack in the tank area. So a
warrior may be good. The problem here is the lack of things to do if you
can't find a group.

I know that my group could use another cleric and another warrior.

I'm lucky since I play with a group of friends who were already
established before FV.
And we created "complemetory" characters. Thus we have a solid 2 group
guild and can raid lowbie dungeons quite nicely (in the warrens atm). 

I would say play what you want, but remember that with the low player
count on FV you will either be LFG, traveling or soloing for some of
your play time. So pick a char that you think would fit in with this.
