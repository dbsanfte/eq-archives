They make fine Shamans. I have a level 34 Kitty Shaman on my old
server. They have some great advantages too. 

1. Sneak
With the sneak skill you can buy/sell anywhere that you can move
safely behind the vendor. Sneak is a highly underrated skill and comes
in real handy at times.

2. Safe Fall
You take less falling damage running over hills with SoW

Most guides are older than the Luclin expansion (when the Vah Shir
were introduced)

>I wanted to make a Vah Shir Shammy b/c EVERYONE seems to have beastlords :)

Go for it. Always play what you want.
