Haha.  Reminds me of a short story in "Analog" a couple years ago.
Basically, if you were convicted of a crime of violence, you were put in a
virtual reality system for a certain number of days, and the simulation was
designed to try to provoke you into losing your temper.  You are released
when you go all the way through without losing your temper.  So, let's say
you are given one year.  You make it to Feb 12, and then lose your temper.
What happens then is that when you wake up the next day, it is still Feb 12.
You are stuck on Feb 12 until you manage to make it through that day without
blowing up.  Then you get to do Feb 13, and so on.  (Oh, and all you have to
do is *wish* something bad to happen to someone in the simulation, and it
does, and you have to repeat that day.  So...the paper boy throws your paper
in a puddle, and you think "I'd like to disembowel that kid", then you lose
for that day.
