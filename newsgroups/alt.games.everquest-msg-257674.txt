Hmmm, kill stealing could actually get *worse* if you lock down mobs
by damaging them.

Imagine a group of players waiting for a level appropriate mob to
spawn.  Now introduce UberPlayer_01 who is very high level.  All
UberPlayer_01 has to do is ding the mob once and tough luck for the
group that has been waiting for the spawn.  I can hear "kill
stealer!!!" already...
