Probably. Supposedly Verant only keeps characters for 6 months officially.
However everyone I haven't heard of them actually deleting any characters of
any age.

Shadows of Luclin has increased the minimum hardware required. For some
people that's been a real problem, for me it hasn't. There are new models
for all the character races, which have gotten mixed reviews. SOL also
includes a CD that upgrades a lot of the old world graphics, which is nice.
Personally I play with all the new models turned off.

SOL also gives you access to the Nexus which provides teleports to the
various continents at 15 minute intervals. It makes getting around Norrath
much easier. Also SOL gives you access to at least two new cities, Shar Vahl
and Shadowhaven, no matter what your race is. There a number of good playing
zones as well. Paludal caverns on Luclin is probably the best xp in the game
from 8 to 25.

SOL introduced a new player character race the cat people, Vah Shir, and a
new hybrid class, the Beastlord. There've been a lot of changes lately some
good, some not so good. The low level (1-10) game is quicker and easier now.

I'd say it definitely is as long as you have a decently fast system.
