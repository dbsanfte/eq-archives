I do exactly the same with Tzen - I buy a stack of 'dots (costs me
around 210pp).  I use them as follows

a) Donate 2 for a Aego / Virtue for me in the PoK (which I think is an
extremely good deal for me and a reasonable one for the cleric (they
gain a dot for the cost of their mana)
b) If I get a group I will give the cleric 3-4 dots straight away to
use as he likes...and they usually do thank me profusely for that.
c) I've also traded 'dots for rezzes (3 or 4)(again, a bit cheaper
than the 50pp I would normally pay) and the cleric gets something they
can never have enough of.

As a soloing ranger (2ish hours play time per night during the week) I
find the extra HP from a buff is well worth the cost of a few dots. 
Stack that with a KEI and a focus of soul I can own most of the
spiders / statues in Velks which is about the best solo exp I can hope
for.../sigh
