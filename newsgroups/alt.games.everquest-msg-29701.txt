I did 29-33 in EverFrost and thought the exp was great, how are you killing
the MOB's?
If you use the snare, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke till dead then of course it
will be slow you are medding all the time after a fight.  I used Ensnare,
root, DOT, DOT, med, dead, or ensnare, dot, fear, melee.  I rarely got below
3 bubbles of mana, I could take on 2 mommas at the same time with snare,
fear, dot, melee.  And I made 2k doing it for those levels, you wouldn't
make that money anywhere else unless you got some real good drops.
