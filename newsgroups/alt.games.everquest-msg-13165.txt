In Starcraft, the Zerg were one of the three races.

One big advantage they had was that thier first attack units, the Zerglings,
spawned 2 at a time, compared to the costs on the other races units.

A popular strategy to take advantage of this was to take the zerg, create as
many zerglings as you can as fast as you can, and then run them all over to
your opponents base before he had a chance to build anything even resembling a
more powerful unit.   They were crap individually, but because they were so
cheap and gotten so early, they could be used to swarm the other guy under.
