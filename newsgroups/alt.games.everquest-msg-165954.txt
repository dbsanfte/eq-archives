I left that all in because it was either that, or snip everything, and
it was such a beautiful piece of self justification and rationalization
it seems a shame to deface it.

If you are in the PoP planes solo at 46 you are going to die. If you are
there in a group, you're being powerleveled. Lke it or not. If you can
find a group to do so, well, I guess Woo Hoo! for you. You get to level
up fast on somebody else's dime.

But please dont' try to justify it. I've gotten hit there. I've gotten
resists there and tested the mobs a fair bit now. Trust me... as a 46/47
bard you aren't bringing a damned thing to the table in any of even the
first tier zones. Unless, of course, it's a group of all guildies and
friends who *want* to PL you, in which case you bring your sparkling wit
and company, which is, of course, valid coin in such a social game.
