Definately not worth it.  You can download them from KaZaA for free most of
the time.  The guides have you do quests and loot certain items and take
forever to complete.  You'd make just as much money from normal hunting
usually.

Usually if I want money relatively easy, I just go over to one of the
Shadowmen camps.  I usually go to the camp in West Commonlands, but you can
also find them in Lavastorm, South Karana, Nekutlos Forest, Lesser Faydark,
and Kithicor Forest.  The one in South Karana is quite the walk if you're
not a druid, and Kithicor Forest is quite dangerous at night.  They're
generally not camped at ALL anymore, because nobody does the journeyman
boots quest anymore. :)

I single pull them pretty easily with a bow & arrow (power ranger style) or
throwing weapon.  Beat them silly, loot any Essence of Shadows that they
drop, and destroy the no-rent weapons (or give them to your pets).  The
Essence of Shadow sells for 75-150 on my trader in the Bazaar.  At least
it's something to do with my LFG tag up waiting on a group.
