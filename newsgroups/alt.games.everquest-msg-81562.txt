One of them is called Tintok Tonsmith (try saying THAT when you're drunk)
iirc. They stand just outside the entrance to the Inn in WC - the Inn near
the tollbooth, NOT the Inn on the lake. Far away from the tollbooth to avoid
aggroing the Freeport Militia there, if that is a concern. Hail one or the
other and follow the prompts.

They both change crafted armor into Small crafted armor, you will have to
Hail them to work out which brother handles which pieces. Note that there is
no way back for crafted - these 'quests' were put in when crafted was
end-game armor for warriors, so resale concerns weren't relevant.
