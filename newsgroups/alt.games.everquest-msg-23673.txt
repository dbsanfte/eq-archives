If you have access to a sufficiently high level Druid,
the route takes about half the time (even less if
your character can't swim very well)

Get invis, get SOW.  Port to Iceclad, do -not- wait
for your porter, just run for the bridge.  It is more or less
southwest of you, you may want to peek at EQ Atlas
for a map location. Nothing in the zone sees invis or
outruns SOW... but the several snow dervishes that
hang out around the portal are quite deadly to unsuspecting
people porting in.  Wizards in particular, who often try
the port without SOW, tend to die.

Form back up with your Invis source once you zone in over
the bridge.  Head due west till you hit the zone wall, stopping
to refresh invis only if the coast is definately clear... and
the snow cougars and snow dervishes are difficult to spot
if you aren't used to them.  As long as you have invis up
there are -very- few mobs in the zone to worry about, but
if you are forced to leg it after it drops steer clear of any
griffins, as they are ranger class mobs, with SOW up themselves,
and outrun anything but Selo's or Cheeta.  Once you hit the zone
wall turn north till you reach the ravine to GD... Lev will get
you down into that the safest and fastest.

SOW and invis make GD a cakewalk, just go due west till
you hit the river, turn right and follow it till you go under the waterfall
and zone in thru the secret wall.
