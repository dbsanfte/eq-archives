There are two for Mithaniel Marr. One is in Halas, and one is in Freeport. I
traveled from GFay last night to get mine in Freeport (and believe me, being
in PK range that was a barrel of fun... expecially riding the boat). The one
in Freeport is in the Temple of Marr, I think on the top floor. The Ethaniel
Marr (not sure about spelling) is there as well, one floor below. Good luck.
