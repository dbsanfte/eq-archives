It's a bit of a stretch, but when you put it that way, it almost sounds 
like it would fit under the definition of terrorism...

Terrorism  n. The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by 
a person or an organized group against people or property with the 
intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for 
ideological or political reasons. (www.dictionary.com)

There's a lot of 'or's in that, I choose 'unlawful', 'violence', 'person', 
'people', 'intimidating', 'societies', and 'ideological'. :)  I don't 
think most societies today suffer terrorism gladly.  But it is, I concede, 
a bit of a stretch.
