Anything I added to Silverlock's post is simply my opinion.
Read on, and safe travels, my friends.

This may hamper most interaction with so many players that it may prove
to be more of a frustrating burden.  Interesting point, though!

No way!  What simple merchant in their right mind would set up shop in a
zone like BlackBurrow, surrounded by hostile beings that hate all others?

I like the present system.  If you need it, carry it.  If not, bank it.  You
should
not be able to retrieve cash from a bank where it is not deposited.  Would a
banker in Grobb honor an account in Freeport?  I don't think so...

At least the money should weigh more, but quadrupling it is overkill.

That kills the need for casters Bind, which is how some collect cash.

Good!  I like that.

Also good!

I still think overkill of language restrictions will hamper the game.

Good.  Same goes for points 10 through 13.

Too much spoon feeding.

WHOA!!!  Us necros say we are KOS enough!!!!

Sorry, I don't get this one.

Come on, getting a decent group together is hard enough.

Good point.  I like this one too!

YESSUH!!!!  This should be done on ALL servers anyway.  Damn twinks

TCC....that's what makes your TV translate to Spanish, right?

I think No-Drops are a little excessive, but you can't free up too many
unless
you combine it with your "Deity"-based items point.

not bad.

Too complex and trivial.

I agree with the no EXP loss, but not the rest.  PvP looting should be
pretty limited.

YES! Less mind-numbing chatter.

Well, at least ease up a little on the restrictions.

Bind is a useful and rather powerful tool and SHOULD have the current
restrictions in place.

emotes are more "physical" than dialect-related, which is why there are
usually accompanied by an animation.  And again, too much language
restrictions will hinder gameplay.

Damn straight!  I can't tell you how many times I've been bugged by some
nitwit who put me in their "Friends" list after getting exp due to grouping
with
others and giving "donkey-like" service at best to the effort.

Too restrictive.

or maybe /who would now act as /near as you described.

Maybe quadrupled as a newbie, but lessened gradually as you gain points
in swimming.  ALSO!  The amount you are weighted down should drastically
affect your ability to stay afloat.  Swim with full plate armor?  I think
not!

OK, but swimming for extreme distances should be pretty debilitating.

LOL!  I haven't bought Velious because of all the bitching I've heard about
