Cease is the first stun you get. It's a stun, but only for like 0
seconds. Good for generating agro and interupting casters, but little
else. That is found on Luclin (You don't have that yet but I'm sure
you could convince someone to pick it up for you, I convinced someone
to pick up Canni2 for me from Abismal Sea.) in Shadowhaven from
Galorano Dablirick from the Cleric Guild.

Lull is located in the Cleric guild in Freeport. First floor on the
right I think. Female vendor if IIRC. It's 15th level for Pallys
though. Will reduce agro of the mobs it's casted on, making single
pulls easier.

Desist is also a 15th level Pally spell. It's another very short stun.
Again really only usefull for interupting casters and gaining agro.
Available from the same guy that sells Cease.

You get your first Rez at level 22, which was originally only
available in Shadowhaven, but apparently can now be found in the
Kaladim Cleric Guild from Fettar Stellwield. (0% exp, but handy for
those people that would otherwise have to run back through dangerous
ground.)

You get your next stun, aptly named Stun, at level 30. This is also
available in the Freeport Cleric Guild. This is the first one usefull
against melee mobs. It stuns for 4 seconds.

You should check out this link for Pally spells. It's a bit out of
date, but stil very usefull.
