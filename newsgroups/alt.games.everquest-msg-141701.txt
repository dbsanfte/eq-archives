Another one of those supply vs. demand things, the worst part about Bonds of
Tunare is that I believe (not high enough level yet so can't confirm) is
that unlike normal snare it has a random duration.  Even if it is fixed
duration it's still shorter duration than the level *1* snare, which makes
it horribly inefficient for even quad kiting.  Plus wizards at least have
their instant click pullstick, our best mana/cast time pull spell is either
Ensnare (1.75 sec/35 mana) or level 1 nuke(1.5 sec/7 mana).  With AE snare
we'd use the level 1 nuke, but the AE snare is then 115 mana for 1.8 min of
snare, or we could just pull with 4 separate Ensnares for 140 mana, for 9
minutes of snare (though more like 8 or so minutes until you'll have to
resnare)
