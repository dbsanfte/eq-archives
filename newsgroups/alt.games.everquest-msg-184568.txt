never bothered to ask for doantions for sow or any other buff. It's my mana
and i decide whether i can/want give it or not. making sow a tradable
product, come on. Be a bit more generous. Feel free to give, feel free to
deny but asking donations for a lvl 14 druidspell? YUCK!

Best way to learn that begging is not proffitable is to cast on ppl in
newbie zones without them asking for it. Ppl who start to ask for it, i
mostly ignore, unless they ask for a heal in wich case i mostly give them
chloro instead. It makes friends and even the ones that are asking mostly
get the point that begging is not done.
