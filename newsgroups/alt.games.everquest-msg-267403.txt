The problem with that is there is no way to retroactively fix all the past
posts, and so people who search on Google Groups or other archives will not
have a good way of telling the two apart.  If posts are to be labeled,
therefore, it is most sensible to label EQ2 posts.

Eventually, if EQ1 posts die out and EQ2 keeps going, then the labels can be
dropped, and people searching can use date qualifiers if they are looking
for old EQ1 information.
