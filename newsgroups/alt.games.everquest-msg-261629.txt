Yep, casting mal-x takes a little while and generates practically no 
aggro at all, in the meantime your groupmates are doing whatever they 
can to be annoying, almost certainly much higher aggro than mal-x.

If Mal-x is resisted, you can recast, again, generating practically no 
aggro at all.

Then when you cast slow, it will generate its normal big spike of aggro, 
but probably you won't get smacked for it by now.  Plus it almost 
certainly won't get resisted, instead of the 50/50 shot you were getting 
casting it on an un mal-x'd mob.

Since in many cases you have to wait a short interval before casting 
slow if you want to avoid aggro anyway, casting Mal-x in that interval 
isn't a bad plan, and if you were getting 50% resists then its almost 
certain to be a good one; multiple mal-x casts rather than multiple slow 
casts means less aggro and less mana spent on the average; memming two 
mal-x spells may be necessary to pull this off at some levels due to 
long recast times on some of the line.  Once you get the unresistable 
version then multiple casts are a thing of the past in most situations.

As a bonus, mal-x doesn't only help land slows, it will help much of the 
rest of your party land their spells and procs, and even if it isn't 
needed to land the spells, will help them hit for full damage or last 
full duration.  Same is true for any subsequent spells you may cast.

Splendid, 65 mage, Firiona Vie (another caster with the Mal-x line)
