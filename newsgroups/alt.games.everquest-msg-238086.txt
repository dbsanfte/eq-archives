  My apologies for butting in with a bit of Godel pedantry, but I
think it is a striking phenomenon how Godel sooner or later is invoked
in any newsgroup.

  Predicate logic is complete in a sense of "complete" which is not
that used in the incompleteness theorem. If you take a pure predicate
logic theory, it is trivially incomplete in the sense of Godel's
incompleteness theorem. Godel's completeness theorem applies to the
theory, but that's a different matter. This double use of "complete"
is the source of endless confusion.
