So, they're about to give Gunthak its own PoK stone. This naturally causes
me to
twitch: another revenue stream nerfed away. But I can still port people to
Grimling
Forest, Twilight Sea, Skyfire Mountains, and Emerald Jungle.  And port fees
are
a pittance anyways - only the truly carelessly rich, or desperate, pay more
than 30pp
to go anywhere. The real money is always in drops. (It's hard to see how
Centi weapons
hold their value when I can get them so easily in Akheva Ruins.)
  Actually, this is more useful to me than not: now I don't have to go
asking other
porters to take my melees to Gunthak. I can have Tosev and Neuv do groups
there,
groups I know will be there regularly from camping there extensively with
Rab and Ada.
The big problem, as always, is time: I'm pressed as it is with Ada trying to
get her
Fury AAs, and Rab could use a bit of Reinforcement for when he casts
Protection of the
Cabbage in a couple of levels. And he will want Dire Charm to contribute
better to
PoV groups. So much to do, so little vacation time left this year...

  On a completely different topic:

  I have discovered WTF Comics. So, Waller is a fan of Harry Turtledove's
Worldwar
series, too. Art style is a bit rough, but he/she is using the strip to
practice. And it lends itself
to a "cute" portrayal of everything.
  Annashi is definitely getting PL'ed...
