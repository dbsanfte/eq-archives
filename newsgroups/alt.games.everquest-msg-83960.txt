My enchanter is 56.  I'm second highest level in the guild (brother is 59
cle).  On a good evening I can get about eight 50+ folks together...of which
MAYBE one knows how to get to Trak.  I lead a middling sized social guild
with aspirations of being able to do stuff like juggs at the drop of a hat,
but it's gonna take a while.  My fellow officers and leaders are all 50+ and
we're damned tired of being a do-nothing guild so we're taking steps while
hoping against hope to keep our minimum level low (well, I want to raise it
to a minimum 30, preferably 40, but it keeps getting vetoed).  It gets
damned old to have a guildy get up to our level and then join a guild like
yours that isn't boring.
