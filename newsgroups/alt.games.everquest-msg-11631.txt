Fair enough. On the other hand,  I'm BOTH red/green and Blue/brown
colorblind.  I made my Chat window fully opaque, colored it black and
set all my text lines to a nice light color.  It works great.  As
others have suggested,if you wan to try it, definitly get Paskettis
excellent ini file editor (I can dig out the link if ya need it).

It's a whole new game, in full screen mode, really.
