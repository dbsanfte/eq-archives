Ok, I don't normally jump into stuff like this, but really...  go tell someone
who gives a crap.  LOL

You've wasted a lot of money?  Hmmm...  Lemme see, over the course of playing,
and having a spouse that also plays, we have purchased:
Original EQ Disk (1)
Kunark (1)
Velious (1)
EQ Trilogy (1)
Luclin (2)
PoP (2)
GoD (2)
LDoN (2)

*I think that is all of em...  hell "Every time I think I'm winning the game
they publish a new suppliment" - Original author unknown...

Ok, so that is the software we have purchased over the course of the years,
don't really know how much that adds up to atm, but it ain't cheap.

Then, you add in that we used to pay *thinks for a moment* $9.95 a month to
play EQ and sometime a few years ago they decided to up it to $12.95 a month,
yet continuing with the same amount of downtime in general.  We yelled, we
screamed, we shook our fists in the air....... and then we paid our $12.95 a
month (multiplied by 2 remember) because in the end, dealing with the problems
of patching and down servers was far less aggrivating than going without the
game entirely.

GoD has only been live a relatively brief amount of time *I'm thinking just
over a month, but I honestly can't remember when it went live...it's all a blur
at this point* and therefore problems abound.

Every time they release a new installment to EQ we go through a really buggy
phase that coincides with a LOT more down time than we like.  This log in
server thing is prolly not related to GoD's release, which makes it all the
more frustrating... but again, you come to expect and understand these
problems.

Does this mean you are not entitled to be pissed about down time?  Not all... 
Be pissed!  Yell, scream, shake your fist in the air...  LOL  Then realize it
will get you absolutely nowhere and move on.

If, after buying one box set of EQ disks and not even using up your free month
*they do still offer that free month right?* you are THAT fed up that you are
going to go apeshit, we don't need you in OUR world.  LOL  Box that software
back up, fire up EBay and try to sell the disks.  I don't know that anyone will
risk an already open box, but some people will try just about anything.

Omg it is early, I rambled far more than I meant to...
