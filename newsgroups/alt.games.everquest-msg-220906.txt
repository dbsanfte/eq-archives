Um...because Paladins are actual Rl history, albeit the classic 
'paladin' tale, Chanson de Roland takes place in the age of chainmail 
and not field plate...http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/OMACL/Roland/

The other main influence on the concept of Paladins, warriors holy to 
god can be sort of bashed to include the legends around King 
Arthur...many of the tales got added to espouse chivalric behavior...
http://www.legends.dm.net/kingarthur/

There can be even further examination of certain military religious 
orders...
http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10304d.htm

And even RL Popes taking to the field...Julius II, patron to 
Michelangelo, and all around artsy dude...kicked buttocks...
http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08562a.htm

We have the mistaked idea that plate armor was worn throughout the 
middle ages, when in fact most of history hasnt had 'full plate' at 
least in the way we think of it. Much of the time, lesser armor was the 
default. http://www.florilegium.org/ is a decent informative place to 
start to explore....one of the largest groups of historical reenactors.

As to the magic, blame that onto fantasy...i really doubt Rolands horn 
could be heard *that* far away, and it also ties into the belief of 
healing touch in kings and fairly religious people. Not going to get 
into a discussion of saints and miracles, but essentially paladins are 
saintly warriors and blessed by god with certain abilities beyond the norm.
