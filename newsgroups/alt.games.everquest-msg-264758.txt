EQ2 only allows 4 characters total per account, not server.  In early 
EQ2 beta, they allowed 8 character slots per account, but was later 
reduced to 4.

People have posted pages of posts on the beta board about this, but 
nobody at Sony will comment regarding how many will be allowed at release.

For some people, myself included, thats a pretty big restriction. 
Anyway, wanted to throw that out there so people know not to expect to 
create a horde of characters at release.

I hope they raise the character limit!
