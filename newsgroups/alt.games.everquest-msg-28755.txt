> What could have made my faction so bad, so fast?

If you buff someone on a hate list then you go on that hate list . when that
mob dies if you havent fallen off that hate list you take the faction hit as
well(unlikely that you wouldnt fall off). Pogs aggro anywhere in the zone
and share hate lists. If you are lucky just the hate list propagated and you
will be fine after you logged . If you are not lucky turn in 4000 muffins to
the dwarf in freeport .
