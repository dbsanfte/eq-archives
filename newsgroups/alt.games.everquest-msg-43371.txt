Hahahahaha!  Dot root...that's good.
As if root no longer breaking snare didn't make soloing a druid
brain-damaged easy, a dot root would allow a monkey to level a druid

Never the less, druids for straight up rooting is the best suited in
the game.

He's getting a lot of spells mixed up.
Protection of the Glades, which is the final upgrade of group
Natureskin has Clarity effect.  Instead of 4hps regen like Natureskin,
PotG has 6 mana point regen.
