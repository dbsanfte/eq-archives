>Really.  DAOC is EQ+, eh?

yes, removes alot of silly fiddly bits, like corpse retreival runs.

>
>Why are you looking forward to your next level in DAOC?

Why do you look forward to your next level in any game?  Oh yah i
remember because in EQ you get spells that have the same effect just
more powerful but get a different name.

>As to downtime I guess you don't have a caster 15+ in DAOC, right?

hmmm, downtime is relative. in EQ a large percentage of total time is
spent in down time, or wait, the other side of this camping the same
place for 96 hours straight so you keep the camp and eventually get
the item to drop, then you do it 6 times over for each person in your
group.

>You don't mind the death penalty in DAOC 'cause you never die?

Death penalty,  its different from EQ, at the very least you wont lose
a level because of death in Daoc.  Death happens, but i realize that
the ubbers who powerleveled up didnt appreciate that the death penalty
might have made this a bit harder at the high level.
