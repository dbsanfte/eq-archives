My message to the writer was as follows...

Sir:

Your article on the evils of Everquest and their contribution to the
tragic death of the particular man is grossly lacking in research and
factual support.

Yes, I do play Everquest regularly. I have a wife and 4 children and
am very successful at my job as a systems analyst for a hospital.

Tell me how it is that if a game is extremely enjoyable, it is blamed
for real life issues the player may have. I love to play. If I neglect
other aspects of my life for it, the game is not to blame. I AM.

Millions of people like to watch the television show "Everyone Loves
Raymond". If one decides to stay home and watch the latest episode
rather than attend their child's kindergarten graduation or ballet
recital, the television show is not to blame. That person is.

People should be accountable for their own actions. The fact that the
man committed suicide after playing Everquest is terribly tragic and I
sympathize with his family. However, Sony is not to blame. That man
had issues FAR greater than his passion for Everquest. Let's address
those with the same zeal. Yeah, the headline would draw less attention
for you, but at least your journalistic integrity would remain intact.
