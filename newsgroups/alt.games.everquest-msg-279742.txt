I always considered that to be the point at which you become geared and 
AA'd beyond the level of a large particular segment of the population. For 
example, I consider elemental and time geared people to be uber, as the 
requirements for reaching that level exceed the capabilities/resources or 
commitment level of a large number of players.

That said, there are certainly various levels of "uber-ness". It of course 
only goes up from there. ;)
