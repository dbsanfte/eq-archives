Does any of you die hard Everquesters have a suggestion what a lvl 14
woodelf druid should buy for his hard earned 100pp.

Currently I'm wearing standard merchant leather armour, and I have a
standard scimitar. Except for two +2 Wis rings (Thanks to Maffer Treehands),
I dont have any items with extras. 

With 5 levels until my next spell level, I think now is the time to spend
the money.

I'm close to EC, so auctions are also a possibility.

Any suggestions are more than welcome.
