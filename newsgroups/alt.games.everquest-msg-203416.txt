For anyone thinking to make a quick trip to the Sisters of Erollisi
Island in OOT from Freeport, don't be surprised to find that the
ship's course through the OOT has changed.

As best as I could determine, the ship was following (in reverse) the
course shown on the Eqatlas map to go from Faydwer to Anatonica, for
most of the way. That was the first surprise. The next one was when
the ship turned North East and then passed between the twin islands
where the aqua goblins and Alluring Sirens (and I think that their
islands were switched in orientation, i.e. the A.S. island is now the
SE one) are then continued East towards the Seafury cyclops, and the
Sister of Erolisi island.

I was after my mage pet spells so I jumped ship and swam to the island
where the high elf merchant sells them then gated back to Freeport. So
I didn't see whether I would have ended up in Butcherblock Mountains.

Along the way, another ship passed going in the opposite direction so
close you'd think you could jump from one ship to another.

I also noticed a couple of points where the sky seemed to go "funny"
for a moment, like you might expect when the computer hurries through
updating the screen.

I know the behavior changed since I had done the trip to Sister island
just before the patch (and was forced to gate back to Freeport to save
my skin) and had to do the trip again after the patch.

Looks like they (SoE) may be trying to fix the relational problem of
traveling West to get to Faydwer which is actually East of Anatonica.
