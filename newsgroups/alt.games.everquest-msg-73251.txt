The problem with this is... If you change to a different Hotkey
page... it wont do the same thing.. unless you have that page with the
same hot keys in the same spots....  And on that line of thought.
Each Character uses the same keyboard layout.... so You attempt to
bind your forage hotkey to your left....   well another character
cannot forage, or something else in that hotkey position.

How I wish there was a way to set up a base keyboard setup... and then
do special configurations for the individual characters.
Oh and yes I do use most of my character slots... and I do jump
between characters alot..
