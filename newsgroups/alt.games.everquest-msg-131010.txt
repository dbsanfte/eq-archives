Yep, there is also a LOT to be said for those smart enough to
coordinate things who DON'T port. Porters don't like 15 people asking
for ports a half hour before a raid. However, if ONE person says
"Myself and four others are ready for a port at the wizard/druid rings
in dreadlands" they are a lot more likely to get it because its not as
much of a bother for a maximum haul. 

Its simply not that hard to get around in the game, especially now. On
virtually any server you have a raid on I could make virtually any
race of level one newb naked character an hour and 20 minutes before
your raid and be at whatever area its going to start in on time. If I
can do that then some level 55 or 60 non newb sure as heck can.
