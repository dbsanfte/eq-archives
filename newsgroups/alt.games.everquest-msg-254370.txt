Wrong on more than one count.

First, Ring of Scale is Kunark dragon faction, having nothing to do with 
Velious (except that there is one ROS faction dragon out in the Western 
Wastes).  They are talking about Kunark type dragons, and killing the 
Kaladim dwarves king.

Second, its entirely possible to be friends with Coldain (velious 
dwarves) and Claws of Veeshan (velious dragons); killing velious giants 
gives you positive faction hits for both, in fact my cleric is max ally 
with both factions.

bunnies out in the newbie zone of Eastern Wastes), Morell Thule
