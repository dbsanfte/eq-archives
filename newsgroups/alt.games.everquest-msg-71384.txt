Phooey! You can so solo an enchanter perfectly well. =P Mine's 35 now and
killing dwarven citizens who are even cons in Butcherblock Mtns. Before this, my
technique consisted of make pet, buff pet, buff self including rune, tash pull
mob, color stun, color stun, nuke, repeat till mob is almost dead, mem blur (to
be sure of getting all the exp), nuke.  This means you take a few hits of
course, but with rune up it doesn't usually hurt *too* much; I heal up while I
med and it's good for maxxing out your defense. You can also charm; but even
with 186 chr I find that goes bad a bit too often for my tastes. Now however the
little suckers are starting to hit a bit too hard, so I've modified the
technique a bit so I don't get whacked on as often. Trade a druid clarity for a
SoW and you can be assured of survival. Tash, fear, suffocate, fear, nuke, fear,
nuke. . .
