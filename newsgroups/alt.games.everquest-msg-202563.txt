How about we just go back and restore the relevant context instead?

/quote Frank E.
It can't be trained and won't ever go up unless you're a class that
gets bash also. For races with Bash and slam, they can bash by hitting
their slam button and Bash will go up. It basically lets them bash
without equiping a shield.

/quote kaev (orig. posted inline after "trained" in Frank's above)
That is so misleading that you might as well just call it false.
While it is true that Slam is not a skill and so cannot be trained,
the Slam ability uses the Bash skill which can be trained (if you
are a Warrior, Paladin, or Shadowknight).  The rest of what you
say is correct (and implies what I posted).
/quote


Pretty lame of you to snip context, but then you've been making some
lame posts lately, so I guess it's par for the course.  My point,
which is obvious to anybody with minimal reading comprehension, is
that it's stupid to say that Slam cannot be trained.  Your full first
sentence:  "It can't be trained and won't ever go up unless you're a
class that gets bash also.", goes to some trouble to address Slam
genericly and not just in the context of the Shaman class.  So while
I should have positioned my response better (at the end of your first
sentence instead of after "trained"), your reply to me is a blatant
attempt to respin what you said (been taking lessons from TwoHead?).
