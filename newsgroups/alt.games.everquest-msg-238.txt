This act wasn't "egoswollen". This was appealing to the majority. Only a
SMALL minority would stand for, much less REQUEST, to have such a feature as
/gu left out.

Hate to break it to you, but by the time you can "handle" trains in, say,
Blackburrow reliably, you're too high to be getting any reasonable amount of
