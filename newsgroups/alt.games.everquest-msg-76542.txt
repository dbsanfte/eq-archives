JaZZ, fyi, when you camped last night, shamu and I headed to Rathe to "make
some money".  Deep was at the Rathe zone line.  It appeared that she had
been trained there and was stuck and couldn't return to her spawn point.
Several hours later, I rezoned into Lake Rathe to camp and Deep was STILL at
the zone line.   Hopefully with the patch, things will be repopped and Lake
Rathe will be back to normal.
