If you can't get a rogue to go with you, the best way to do it is to duel (or
if you're going to be gone longer than a day, die) and leave the keys on the
corpse.   (A corpse out of the way too, please.  Others have to target around
it. : P)

That way you don't have to camp the first two bosses for the umpteenth time
when you get in.

Anyways, have fun with it.   Charsis is one of my favorite zones, even after
all this time.
