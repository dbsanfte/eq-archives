You also don't get to pick which zone you will be in, when I tried this I
found I was almost always a warrior, and almost always in a zone with
no PC's even close to as low as my level.

I did find that I did not drop back to character screen if I tried to zone,
instead I got bounced back into the zone I was in.

Interestingly, you can gain skills (several times I got kick (1)) and experience

while fighting, I got my level one rat to level 2 in WFP.  On the other hand
you are not as powerful as NPC mobs your level, at least until you get
your skills up, going up to an identical even con mob will get you killed
before the target is at half damage.  The only reason my rat was able to
level up is that I was aware that snakes in that zone are much easier targets
than rats.
