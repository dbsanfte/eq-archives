I wondered if anyone brought out this dead horse. Iksar necros have
human pets currently. The official reason was the global file was
full, but now they have said they fixed it.
Does that mean Iksar Necromancers will get Iksar Skeleton pets anytime
soon?

Personally I would like a Vah Shir skelly pet, the Skeletal hunters in
SWT look very cool.

Don't bother complaining that they didn't fix it cause they hate their
customers, I imagine it isn't the top of the list.
