And saves them from having to actually know how to decently admin a news
feed.  It's the way everything goes, get less and pay more.  But I don't
have to like it.  @Home died and my particular MSO tried to get out of
providing NNTP servers.  But they faced alot of backlash, and in the end
relented, to a point, they simply farmed it out.  All they did was provide
you with a 1GB/month GigaNews account.  Certainly better than the original
stance of NO Usenet.  But it's a far cry from what I was getting before.  
I think cable may just nickel and dime and feature creap themselves to
death, giving the upper hand back to the ILECs in the end with DSL.

Some competition.
