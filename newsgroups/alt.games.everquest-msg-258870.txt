The explanation of damage and delay on weapons has been explained well
and the bazaar option mentioned.  

There is another option open to barbarian characters however if you
want to "earn" your weapons.  Follow the north wall of the Tundra area
in Everfrost until you cross the river twice.  Ignore the hidden
entrance to Permafrost and stay along the wall to avoid mobs until you
get to the castle area where someone is bound to be killing the
giants.  Ask nicely if they will sell you a fine steel weapon for a
few platinum.  (Vendors will only pay about 5 platinum for the fine
steel wepons and they are heavy; the player camping the giants should
sell you all you want for 3 platinum each so he or she can stay at the
giant camp.) Load up with all you can carry.  For your effort you get
a much better weapon than your rusty axe, albeit not a magical one.
You can sell the extra fine steel for a profit and then head to the
bazaar with a sense of having explored instead of having farmed
spiders. The fine steel will be fine until you start to fight mobs
that require you to wield a magic weapon (e.g. the ice bone skeletons
you may see on your venture to Permafrost).

The camper may ask you for 10 platinum in exchange for 100 gold and a
bunch of silver and copper because the lower value coin is getting
heavy for them. This is another money maker for you.  When I started,
I could lose a corpse at level 3.  It's cake now until level 10.
