You *really* need to forward that to his current guild's boards. 
Seriously.  Guilds at the level where they work on epics generally have 
to put a hell of a lot of blood sweat and tears into getting them. And 
for a guild on that tier, the bard epic is no picnic. (UDB spawning 
Trakenon can be a nightmare for a smaller, lower level guild). They 
should know who they are investing their time and resoruces in.
