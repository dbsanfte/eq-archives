Focus items with spell haste are a little more complex than I
previously thought.

As with other focus effects, they affect spells as follows:

Focus I: spell levels 1-20
Focus II: spell levels 1-44
Focus III: spell levels 1-60
Focus IV: spell levels 1-65

But here's the funny thing.  They each affect only spells of a
different minimum casting time:

Spell Haste I: 1.0 sec or more
Spell Haste II: 2.0 sec or more
Spell Haste III: 3.0 sec or more
Not sure about Spell Haste IV.  Pattern would suggest minimum 4.0
sec cast time


This means that if you have, for example, a spell haste III item
and are casting Root, it will take 2.0 seconds, but if you have
spell haste II or I item it will only take 1.7 seconds.  Of
course if the spell is level 45 or higher and has a 2.0 second
duration then the lower level focus item won't work.

If you have some lower level spells you are still casting,
though, and they have cast times too low to be hasted by your
high level item, it might be worth carrying lower haste item for
this sort of benefit;

As a cleric, I'm looking at my list of low level spells I still
use:

(1) Divine Aura: 1.0 seconds.  Spell haste I should make this .85
seconds
(1) Flash of Light: 1.5 seconds.  Spell haste I should work but
NOT II, 1.275 cast time
(5) Gate: 5 seconds.  Any haste should work on this one.
(5) Stun: 1.5 sec.  As with FoL, 1.275 with SH I only
(9) Root: 2.0 seconds  Spell Haste I or II might make this 1.7
seconds
(19) Holy Might: 2.0 sec, so 1.7 with SH I andSH II
(29) Divine Barrier:
(29) Counteract Disease:
(34) Atone:
(34) Force:
(39) Complete Heal.  Immune to spell haste effects

I can't think of anything under 44 that I cast under pressure;
sure there's Bind Affinity but is that ever an emergency?

I don't have the times on the blank spells there, and for some
reason castersrealm isn't responding.

Has anyone noticed if Blessing of Piety and Blessing of Faith
also have lower cast time limits on them or heck, for all I know
none of the series have cast time limits.

At any rate, on some of these spells, chopping 15% or 30% off
cast time could really be worth far more than whatever uber item
you'd normally carry in that slot.

Something to think about
