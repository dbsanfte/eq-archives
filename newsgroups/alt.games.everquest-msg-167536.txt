Is PoP worth buying you ask????

I would say yes if you play everquest alot, which many of us do. If
you are a druid or a wizard then you really dont need it for its best
feature, the books which teleport you around. Other than that there
are some new zones that apparently give insane experience at post 50
levels, and this new level 65 thing is just great. There are also new
spells just for POP and also alternate abilities. So again if you play
EQ alot then you should get this. If you play every now and then and
have a level 20 character, then don't waste your money.
