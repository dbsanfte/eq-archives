The blue line is a "5X magnifying glass" on the yellow bubble
that you're currently working on.

Five bubbles worth of blue line (i.e., one complete blue
line) is one yellow bubble.  When your blue line "rolls over",
you've just finished the yellow bubble you had been working
on, and are starting on the next.

At higher levels, where exp movement is slow, it's nice to
have the "magnifying glass" to help you judge how much
exp movement you're getting (or not getting), since the
yellow bar will appear utterly motionless for any given
kill.
