Halfling problems: As (arguably) the best stats for druids, Halflings
attract a lot of min/maxers to the race. Thus the term droods.  They don't
care who gets hurt as long as they can maximise their xp gain, and end up
pissing a lot of people off. That's the primary reason halflings are looked
down on so hard. They also seem to get a LOT of noobs playing the class (not
newbies... noobs, you should know the difference. If not, 'cn i plz have sm
plat to by my spells') for reasons that remain unclear to me.
