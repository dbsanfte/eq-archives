Granted, the catering to the new player has more to do with the 
improvements they've made in that area. You now start out with a backpack 
and more food than originally. There is a Find feature. There are in-game 
maps available. You no longer lose xp or have to retrieve your corpse 
when you die during your early levels. The list goes on and on.

No way of knowing just to look at them. Your best bet is asking first. 
I've told you all I know in that regard.

You can't play them both at the same time, but you can play one to take a 
break from the other without having to create it on a different server 
where you may not know anyone.

If you already have a character on FV, you'll have to delete it to create 
a new one. Sorry.
