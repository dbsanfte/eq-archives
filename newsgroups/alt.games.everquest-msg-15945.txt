Quake3, still. Not as dedicated as I used to be, Clan had a big fallout and
reformed, I stayed friends with all of them but WTF is no longer the clan
(in spirit) it was and I can't really see me joining another.
That's pretty much it, I'm not a big fan of computer games other than the
FPS genre and even then I choose one and stick with it. I have no idea why I
enjoy EQ at all, I just do (none of my friends can figure it out either, as
I have no patience for any other RPG type of games) I guess it's that it is
not linear, the game is what you make it, you can be as lazy as you want to
be or as power hungry as you like, whatever, you play it at your speed and
individualise your character.
