Hope everyone has a hearty appetite....

I have been on reduced happy pills dosage for about 3 weeks now so currently
am cooking on a  4 burner gas BBQ with 3 foot long tongs. I have Chefs hat
emblazoned with "I'm cooking so suck my dick bitch",  apron with plastic
tits on them and an Esky choc full of beer.

Grab your mozzie repellant and paper plates folks, BBQ season is just
getting starting as it looks like I will be in complete and utter asshole
mode for a while to come... as opposed to just regular asshole mode that is.
