I've already explained it. If you couldn't grasp the explanation, then
you're only proving my point about IQ's. If you want an answer, then
read my posts again, and take off the selective filtering of anything
that weakens your case. Just like any other fanatic, you're refusing
to acknowledge anything that makes your case look weak.

What I don't see is why the fuck you even give a rat's ass about this
"tie-in" if you don't want to buy the product. Don't buy the product.
That simple. Viola! No effect on your pathetic little life whatsoever.

Oh, wait, no excuse to whine, either...
