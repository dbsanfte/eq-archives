Right, I said I've never worked at one organized like that.
From dictionary.com:

"information technology
n. Abbr. IT

The development, installation, and implementation of computer
systems and applications."

experience is rather limited -- only 20 some years and only
five companies with a primary product of software.  *shrug*
