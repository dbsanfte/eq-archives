Funny. I saw some "pale and fucking overweight" people, but I also saw
some nicely tanned and then, some very athletic, some average. In
short, I saw what I'd expect to see in a photo of any large group of
people. Could have been a group of people standing around at a bus
station...

*shrug* Try harder. No flames to be found here.

( By the way, you are aware that the average American is "pale and
fucking overweight", right? Doesn't matter what their hobbies are... )
