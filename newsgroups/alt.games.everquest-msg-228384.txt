No need to hunt him down.  It can be done through the guild tool.  And, he
does not need to be on-line.  I know, I did it the other day to an alt that
I was about to delete, just to make sure it worked.

One or the other.  If both, it looks like a spiteful action on his part to
de-guild anyone before he goes.  I think 2 is the true high road.
