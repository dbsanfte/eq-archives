Hmm.. well do you get perks to your bandage.... 
As you get higher in level you have more HP...  you can still only
bind to 50 % but as you get better at bind it doesnt take as many
binds to get to 50 %,  and   50 % at level 5  and  50 % at level 50
is a Huge difference.. even on a caster...

so you do get a bigger bonus..
