Ok, I'm killing centaurions and legionares at the fort, minding my own
business, and along comes this damn bard.  He wants to kill the elites.  No
problem I tell him.  I pull my centaurions up over the hill and the next thing
I know the chief is pounding me - he can outrun my wolf form.  Of course I end
up dead.  The idiot bard didn't even apologize.  
Exactly what song is this freakin piss ant playing that he ended up with ALL
the elites and chief running all over the place????  And is he not good enough
to be doing this?  Is that why they all "got away from him"?
