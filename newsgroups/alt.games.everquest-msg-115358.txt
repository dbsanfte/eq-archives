Why?  I mean, it's cheaper and faster casting than Lesser Succor but I've
yet to bother with Egress since the level 18 spell came out (mana cost
savings is only 50 with Egress).  I'm glad I have Egress, but it's not that
important to me anymore.

Lesser Succor and Evac are SOOO damned useful!  Want to get to Cab/LIO zone
line?  Port to DL, run to FM.  Evac to LIO zone line.  Zone into LIO.  Evac.
You're next to Cab.
Want to get to OT?  Cast Skyfire port then Evac...you're next to OT zone.
Want to go to Dalnir?  Zone into OT, evac again, and you're next to WW!

Wizard and druid evac points are the same, and eqdruids has a list of them
(Graffe probably does as well).  It sure does make doing small dungeon raids
a hell of a lot easier.  I've already saved my party (wizzy at 48) in
Chardok, Kaesora, and The Hole with minimal regrouping time!
