I agree, saying "I don't know what level you are" and then not specifying
what you mean by "in the higher levels" is pretty muddy thinking.

At level 50 I am still stunning, many situations I stun -far- more than
I ever heal.  Mobs that hit hard and fast get chain stunned, as do any
that cast anything important at all.  Admittedly I've been in fights where
the mob was hitting wimpily and it worked better to slap a celestial
on the tank continuously, instead of trying to keep up the stun parade
(can't med while you chain stun) but its quite situational.

I have a hotkey that says
/g Chain stun on %T, NO HEALS AVAILABLE TILL ITS DEAD
/cast 5
/cast 6
/cast 7

and I mean it.  Certain mobs cannot be allowed to cast anything at
all, which means I'm mashing that button repeatedly come hell
or high water, and no, I can't stop long enough to slip a heal in
because someone broke mez on something else.  My target  is
doing very little damage to anyone, and I'm not a healer at that
point, I'm a dedicted stun gun.

Even if I did want to let up, chain stun seems to tickle, and that
mob is "coming right for me" if I do, which means you still don't
get a heal and now you have to do a CR for the cleric too.
