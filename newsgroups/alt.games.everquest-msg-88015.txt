  The problem is that Verant doesn't have a consistent naming convention.  Some
mobs are named "Orc Pawn" and others are "an orc pawn".  "Here comes Orc Pawn,
get ready to fight" sounds almost as stupid as "Here comes a an orc pawn, get
ready to fight".

  I wish they had a naming format for items, mobs, ect. like text based games
I've played.  Each mob and item should have an 'article' and a 'noun'.  So you
have 'an/orc pawn', 'a/Dervish thug', 'Lady Vox'... that way messaging sounds
right and consistent.  Same with items, 'some/bone chips', 'a/tarnished
broadsword', 'The/Fiery Avenger'.

  Don't see anything wrong with "cometh" or something "reeking" of roleplaying,
though it should be consistent with your pattern of speech.  If you talk in a
casual, somewhat modern fashion when normally communicating in game, and then
you have a pull social which is in "roleplay-ese", it's jarring and actually
counter to the roleplay 'atmosphere', in my opinion.
