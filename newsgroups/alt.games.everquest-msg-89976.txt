What you really mean here is, put it back the way it used to be. Once upon a
time you COULD type /who commons and it would show you who was in the west
commons.

Sounds pretty good to me. Currently the 50+ crowd already uses the LFG tag
SERVER WIDE. If you are heading to chardok and looking for a rogue to round
out your party just type /who LFG  rogue all and you'll see if one is LFG. I
really wonder sometimes if everyone 50+ realizes we do this... there are
usually very few people with LFG tag on, but I put it up anytime i'm not
already in a group or otherwise occupied, has gotten me to some GREAT
places.
