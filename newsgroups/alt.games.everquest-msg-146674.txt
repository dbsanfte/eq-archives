I just scribed mask of hunter into spellbook.(outdoor only)  Mask of stalker
has been sited in Bazaar for 50k plat. It drops off same mobs as KeI and
BoA, which sell for about 30k. Makes no sense to me,  Kei is 14 mana regen
per tick GROUP buff, while Mask is 3 mana per tick self only buff , but I
guess people figure druids will have the cash to pay for it.  As far as I
have seen, every PC vendor selling MoS in bazaar is a mule for an uber
guild. I have seen one named Tiona either attempting to sell the same copy
of MoS for 3 weeks now for 50k, (she is always AFK, will not reply to
requests to negotiate) or her guild farms it on a regular basis.  On Eci,
Reconstructed farms Ssra temple 24/7. As a druid it makes me a little
annoyed to see clerics get a npc vendor bought manaregen spell, while we
have to pay through the nose for ours.
