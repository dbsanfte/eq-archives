Ah, so now you are calling spelling mistakes intentional? Or do we
need to point out your "selective snipping" where you rather sneakily
removed the rest of what I said in order to set up a strawman?

Your lameness is reaching new lows. :-) Someone who bothers to read
the context you mangled should come to a different conclusion.

*laugh* this coming from someone who forgets his own posts a day after
he posts them and thought the height of debating at one time was
simply repeating "why? why? why?" over and over. :-)

Forgive me if I use words too large for you, but I will try to explain
in the simplest terms I can, *with* the context restored.

See, the problem with the baloney you're trying to sell now is that
you lost this part of the context. I was not saying you *are*
condescending and snobbish - as I said before I at one time, before I
became more experienced, agreed with you. So I knew where you were
coming from. But, I was pointing out an unintentional slant in your
post. Why do I know it was unintentional? Because you declared it
could have ended with smileys, which would have changed the tone. I
point out that doing so would have altered the text away from the way
it sounded, and you have abundantly proven my case with your replies,
showing that indeed, you do have a snobbish, arrogant attitude towards
those who use (because you seem to think they need to) emotes.

The irony of pointing out you aren't any better than anyone else was
delicious. :-) Of course, I wouldn't say you are bad, either, since
you're obviously literate. Just not superior. And somewhat poor at
reading comprehension, and with a slight bias problem that taints your
reading of some posts. *cough*


>>
>>All of which are unintentional or random changes, which means you (of
>>course) missed the point.

Which we are showing quite decisively you did. The "changing complete
sentences" comes close to getting it, but in the context of the other
two, one of which is unintentional and one of which is just random, it
wasn't taken the way you seem to indicate it should be before. Though
emoticons wouldn't have helped this statement of yours, a casual
knowledge of how to write sentences in context would have. :-)


>> or random changes,
>
>Deliberate random changes, not unintentional ones.

Oops, all that random flaming and he suddenly realizes I will probably
notice his selecting snipping.... here comes the spin cycle. Now that
you are backpedalling back to sanity, you are starting to near my
point, which is, was, and remains, people are not as aware of their
tone of voice online as they think they are. In effect, you are now
agreeing with me. You just don't seem to be able to see it. *shrug*

>
>You really don't know whats going on, do you?

I am more on top of this in my sleep than you are on your best day,
noob. :-)


>Try and read what you wrote, and then the reply,

LOL! Hilarious stuff, coming from someone who can't even stay
consistent with himself! Flashback time....

*yawn* If you say so, sport.

You couldn't understand it, as usual.

Note: no response... either way he will contradict one of his own
posts. "The text" he refers to is nothing more than a weak flame.

Note: no response, as he attempts to wriggle out of his earlier
statements by snipping them out of the context.

I don't think it would help much. Bad thought and bad writing remains
such no matter how it's heard.

>courses in basic English. 

He's falling to profanity now. We could point out the irony of that,
too, but like the rest of this thread I think he'd miss the point.

Another thing I find hilarious is the fact he will claim that
emoticons are unnecessary when one's writing is expressive enough, and
then when its thrown back at him *with examples*, he blames the
*reader*. :-) This is quite the case study in someone's ego gone out
of control. You really see yourself as quite the writer, don't you?


>You seem far beyond the help of humble, overworked
>emoticons. May as well put water wings on the
>Titanic.

And yet, with a few simple words I reduce you to a quivering mass of
silliness and vitriole. :-) The ease of which was unexpected,
considering I was for the most part agreeing with you, other than one
point. That makes it even funnier. :-)

Keep on dancin', puppetboy.

Not really.

So, does all your worldly knowledge come from the songs you hear on
the radio, then? Another thing that would explain much....
