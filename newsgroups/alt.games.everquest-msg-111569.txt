at the time, i had the newest betas out (dont know what they were, i think
"6058" or something, with "6043" being the latest official release).

its not just that EverQuest is doing a lot of stuff that taxes your system,
its just REALLY SHITTY programming.

NOTHING that old with such simple graphics should run THAT bad. especially
when doing something like just staring at a wall in Bazaar.

when stuff like complex graphics and stuff pushes a graphics card to the
limits, and im still getting close to 200fps (Quake 3, 3DMark2001, Jedi
Knight II, etc), and then suddenly "downgrade" to a game like EverQuest, and
come to a screaching halt at 8fps, its just insane. Hopefully, if
Verant/Sony is doing COMPLETE re-writes of their 3D engine, the Star
Wars/EQ2 games should actually perform a LOT better than EQ on the same
system. EQ has just been crap piled on crap piled on more crap (a poor
DX5/Glide game, then upgraded to DX7, and then upgraded to DX8, never fixing
any issues with it.)
