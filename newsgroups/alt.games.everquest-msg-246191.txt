That's right.  Last night, when I got to the character select screen
all the letters were gone.  There were no labels on the buttons and no
name or title showing on my toon.  Fortunately, I remembered which
buttons were the Play and Exit.  When I pressed the unlabeled Exit
button, I went back to the sever select screen and every thing was
normal.  When I pressed the unlabeled Play button, I went to Norrath
but no words.  All the subscreens were unlabeled.  There was nothing
in the message/tips and I couldn't type anyhing which makes role
playing really tough.  All the buttons were unlabeled.  The compass
was gone.  The gems did show up (no hotkeys) and the movement keys
worked though.  However, the mouse was super sloooooow and very 
jerky.  It was almost impossible to position it over the Sit or Camp
buttons. I ended up using the control-s and control-x buttons to get
out.  When I get back out everything was fine.  Re-booted (a couple of
times) and the same thing happened.

Anyone have any ideas as to what was happenning? Any suggestions?

BTW, I am running with windows 98, a 700 MHz processor and the TNT
Ultra card with the latest NVidia drivers.  This environment has been
working fine since EQ went to DX9.

Many thanks.
