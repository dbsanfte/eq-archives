No, that is not what I want.  It is something I am willing to do if he
keeps insisting that anyone is afraid of him and won't meet him face to
face.  I prefer to solve disputes in a nonviolent manner if at all
possible.  If you have never harmed another human being physically you
may not know the guilt involved, even if they asked you to harm them,
but it is not a joy.  Crowd control being a part of my job when I used
to work in a dive bar it is something I am familiar with.  That is not
something I desire in life, but I am willing to deal with if he insists
on it and signs the appropriate release forms.
