Are you having trouble "taking the spires" up to Nexus or down from
Nexus to Great Divide? If the problem is going up, are you getting to
stone from the scion? (hail him/her) Of course, failing those, there's
always druid/wizards to port you there or the boat from NRo.... (
Heaven forbid anyone actually use the boats now days. >< )
