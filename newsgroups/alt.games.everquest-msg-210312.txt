I would have replaced it with banded long before level 15, actually
I'd never have bothered with it at all.

Replace it with what you can afford selling spiderling silk, skins and
whatever else in the bazaar. Then do a search in the bazaar per slot
and a range of 1 to 200 plat or something. Buying stuff in the bazaar
with items you earned is not being "twinked."
