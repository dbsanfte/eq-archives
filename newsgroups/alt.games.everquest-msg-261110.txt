All right, the reflective water looks kinda neat.  But seeing as the
sky has completely disappeared, it loses some of 'wow' factor.

That and it tends to look like a soap bubble as it tries to reflect
'blankness'.  Not the nicest effect.

Any ideas?

FWIW:
ATI 9600
Catalyst 4.7 drivers
DirectX 9.0c
Win98SE

Can run WoW, Dawn of War and Farcry just fine.  What's up with EQ?
