I really didn't think I was going to like it, but after playing for just a
little while, I had to admit that it's quite nifty.

That said, there are some things they need to fix on the multi-player
interface.  Without first-person perspective, it's just confusing, and not
having the standard name-over-the-head thing only makes it more so.  If it's
just my friend, her husband, and I playing, it's pretty kick-ass.  If it
get's any larger, it starts to decay pretty quickly.
