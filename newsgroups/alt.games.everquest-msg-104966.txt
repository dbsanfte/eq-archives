Instead of kiting and running away. ( to many folk new to seeing druids
kiting it looks like you are fleeing ) Rot it as others have stated or if
you want to get offense/melee up ensnare then fear then beat on it as it
flees. Refear as needed. Don't get hit too often although it does help get
defense up.
