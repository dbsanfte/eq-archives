I had a problem with that triangular tearing in crowded or big zones. The 
single biggest performance boost I got was when I played with the water 
effects in the options menu.  There's a setting (don't remember exactly how 
its worded) that says something like 'refresh once'.  Even in bigger zones 
where there is no water (like NQ) I got a dramatic performance.

Turning off the shadows also helped a lot.

I'm jealous that you can play on the road...
