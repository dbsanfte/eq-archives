I find this group very interesting, myself. There are exactly two people I
killfiled the first day I started reading it (one of whom you just replied
to), and a third I reluctantly killfiled after the umpeenth time she respond
with "so?" to someone's (not mine) sincere effort at communication.

Once those three are filtered out, this group is a terrific forum.
