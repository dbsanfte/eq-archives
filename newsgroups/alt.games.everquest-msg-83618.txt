Hi,

I just started my first Cat a few days ago and am liking it a lot.  However,
with the food rate consumption I plan to work on baking to help get food
that lasts longer.

My problem.   All the sites and info I can find for recipes and trivial
tables are Norrath based and the ingredients needed for low level stuff are
not found on the moon.  My cat is only lvl 6 so I don't plan on moving him
just to get baking ingredients.  And all the cookbooks available seen to be
just for the standard Norrath food.

My question.  Does anyone know what any Luclin based recipes are, especially
low level stuff?  Are there any Luclin cookbooks available near Shar Vahl?
Does anyone know of Luclin Trade Skill sites that describe the stuff to do
Upstairs?

Thanks for any help.
M.
