Aoebe is working on Brewing (136) to make cash on heady kiolas,
tailoring (95) for some greyhopper armor, leather padding, and
10 slot weight reducing bags, cash sales again, and smithing
to work on cultural armor at some point.

Heres her delemia, about the time she levels up to where she
can wear the Salabruoius(spelling?) armor, she should be able to
either fight for better stuff, or through selling in the bazaar, buy
better stuff.

Nothing she seems to make at the levels she can get the componets
at seems to sell, except for 'parts',  She has a barbarian friend that is
smithing, and is faced with the same thing, his cutural armor kinda
sucks against what is for sale in the bazaar, and doesn't even sell for
2/3 the cost of the makes / versus fails.

She just kinda wants to go out and kill stuff now to vent.
She is level 24, so I suppose she should just level up to 45 and then
revisit
making stuff.

Overall is seems as if there has been a bit of a fracture in the 'stuff you
can
make for others, appropirate for levels, at the level you are at' logic....
Of course, maybe Aoebe is a whining cleric in need of a good spanking....
