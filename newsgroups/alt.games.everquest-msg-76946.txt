The best places for good bang for bucks resist gears is old world.
Check the Hole (the withered leather for WIS casters and loam for INT
casters), froggie crown (+20 FR/CR is still damn hard to beat), some
of the armor from SG have high FR, even good old jewelcrafting can
generate very good resist items.

The key is go look, you'll be amazed at how many "crap" items that
people dismiss are very useful.  I'm still amazed at how many WIS
casters think wither leather is crap.  I was wearing withered leather
shoulders for the longest time until I got the shawl off Lady Mir.

The stuff from Velious like the cured tizmak stuff, great FR/CR/MR
gear.  And some of the stuff coming out of Luclin is also very good
and most appear to be relatively painless to obtain.
