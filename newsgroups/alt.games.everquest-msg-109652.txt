Would you be for or against a new expansion after POP and why?

I'm against.  

I would like to see some of the old world fleshed out a little more.  

Also would like to see most of the quests given a good overhaul, replacing 
some of the older ones with newer ones.  I like the multiquest sets given 
by the starting guilds in Kunark.  I would like to see that concept 
expanded to the other races in the game.  Trade skill quests are good.  I 
would like to see more of them also.

Trade skills should also be revamped.  From what I read on EQTraders posts 
on the fanfaire the fellow doing the skills has a good idea of what he 
wants to do, but doesn't have the staff because of the expansion treadmill 
VI seems to be on.  I don't want to make them into a money maker that's not 
the point of them, but into less of a money drain.

It would also be nice to revamp some of the older zones with new content.  
I'm sure newer trees have grown in the zones just as older trees have died.  
Some of the towns should be updated as well.  Qeynos just screams for some 
urban renewal where all the empty buildings are located.  I mean all you 
have there are the lovers, the tax collecter and that blasted civil 
engineer trying to build a bridge to Erudin.  And don't get me started on 
the torque shop in Halas.  Man I would have thought that couple would have 
been out of business long ago.

Anyway I'm sure I have more but haven't thought of them.
