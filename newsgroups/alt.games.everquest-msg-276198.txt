I don't get it.  Even in the old bazaar there was usually quite a bit of
open space (at least at the times I visited), yet traders still seemed to
prefer grouping so tightly together it was hard to click on the one you
wanted.

They're still doing the same damned thing in the new bazaar.  It's not like
any one spot sells better than another.  Either a player wants what you're
selling or s/he doesn't.

Someone mentioned that they still have to turn off traders to walk around.
Why?  I've not noticed any lag, if that's the problem.
