Ok, it's released and I'm in the US.  I see a whole bunch of folks running
around 61st level and they got the game yesterday.

I ordered with overnight delivery from Amazon.com and it still hasn't
shipped. (teaches me for clicking a "help support this web site.." ad.

I then check local stores "we are expecting it any day now..."

Yeah, I'm a bit ticked...  I'm just not sure if I should be ticked at Sony
or at Amazon but, being as the stores haven't gotten it, I'm gathering that
Sony is the foul up point in the equation.
