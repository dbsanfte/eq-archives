Hi All

Here's the latest from the SOE site

------------------------------------------------- Insert Text 
----------------------------------------------------

In the next update, tentatively scheduled for December 16th, any bards 
who have used AA points to purchase either Extended Notes 3 or 
Sionachie's Crescendo will have those abilities removed and the AA 
points reimbursed.  The abilities are being changed so that they only 
affect beneficial songs and chants.  The use of these abilities on some 
AOE and damage songs or Chants was overbalancing, which made this change 
necessary.  Please be aware that you will be receiving a refund of these 
AA points and that you cannot save more than 30 points.  So if your 
refund brings you over 30, you will need to spend them before you zone 
after the update.
Yours
-- 
Denzil
