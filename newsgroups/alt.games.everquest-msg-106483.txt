What didn't you understand? It's based on your level. Get a couple
more levels and you'll find its suddenly 6. It's built in to
Copelands, though its unlikely Copelands is fully up to date on the
changes to two handed damage bonuses over delay 40 since Copeland
himself has been MIA presumed quit for a long time now. Damage bonus
has been around since the beginning, but they decided to make it
visible a little while back.

This is why people who include "damage bonus" in their auctions are
morons.
