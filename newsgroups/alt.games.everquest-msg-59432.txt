31 druid with a 28 warrior "pet", what would be a do-able dungeon for us?

Mostly concerned with exp and sellable loot, or haste items, really wouldn't
mind a haste item  =P

Splitpaw was boring as hell because we had to limit pulls a bit and no good
loot.
Crystal Caverns ended up getting me the druid killed once and a 27 bard
friend who tagged along killed 7 times (he was 26 after that), granted, the
bard really shouldnt've run INSIDE the Ry'gorr fort inner keep without invis
on...
I've considered ToFS, but the close proximity of everything in the entryway
makes me worried (especially since it took about 8 seconds for 4 shadow
beasts and 2 lesser ice shades to smear me into a pulp)
Dalnir's looks possible though.
Kaesora looks theoretically doable, but I've seen enough horror stories to
kill that idea (unless someone can convince me otherwise).
Mistmoore seems a lot the same as Kaesora, except it gives a 53 ranger in my
guild nightmares to think about that place.
Unrest would seem possible except that the only things still blue to us
would be deep inside, wolf form gets me out of trouble, but my partner is
still going to have to fight his way in.
I ground out 30 camping the barroom in Solusek A, so I *really* don't want
to go back there.
Temple of Cazic Thule might work except for major transport issues for the
warrior (no group port to Feerott, closest bind spot in FP or Arena)
Upper Guk is a no because both of us prefer to keep our live froggy faction
and I believe we're too low for Lower deadside, not as a partership but
joining another group even (and transport/bind issues...)

And I know nothing about Droga/Nurga or Permafrost.

I have no problems with outdoor dungeon-like places either (EG LoIO Sarnak
fort/gob mines, FM giant fort etc)

Hmm... ok, so I'm really looking for help on strategy for ToFS or
suggestions about Kaesora/Mistmoore/Droga/Nurga  =P

Also, the warrior may very well be 29 or 30 by the time this information is
used, and we might have a 29 or 30 bard available to come with us, if that
changes anything.

Oh, and the first person to say "go to Overthere"  or "fear kite
cougars/dire wolves in Iceclad/EW/GD"  gets my suicidal napalm recipe.
