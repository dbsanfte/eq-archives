Roflmao.....this is OUTSTANDING.

My RL friend is a 65 chanty and I'm a 65 Cleric. We both have a second phone
line and when we play  we're always on the phone together. Most all of the
groups we play in are pickup groups. Sadly, it is not uncommon to get into
groups that are guilty of most all of the things mentioned above. In fact, I
act as his assistant. He'll start complaining someone keeps dotting the
incoming, or not assisting the MA and start beating on random mobs he's just
locked down. We'll watch and see if this was just an accident or a regular
pattern. If this is happens again, while he is trying to get control back,
I'll send a tell to the offending player or if it's multiple people screwing
up, I'll send a group message to watch what they're doing and pay attention
to the chanty's messages and /or properly assist the MA. Most of the time
one tell or one group message fixes things so people start working together
properly.  Once in awhile, we get a "know it all cowboy" that keeps breaking
mezz and causing "pain and suffering" to the group. This person will get an
"extended vacation" to his bind point.
