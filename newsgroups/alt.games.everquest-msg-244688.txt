I was wondering about that possibility myself.  Some of the posts out there
for guild recruitment were pretty ... ummm ... uber.  Requiem has a post
advertising for recruits that I found interesting.

Understandable.  It's kind of a Catch-22.  You can't get into a guild to
until you've proven yourself, but I'm finding it difficult to find a groups
to meet peopek and prove myself without a guild.

I thought about that as well.  I like the concept of one character and one
character only, but for someone with limited playtime getting past the
language barrier may be a bit of a challenge.  Unless, of course, they've
changed that.  My little cleric on FV has been sitting idle for almost a
year now.

I also considered the Test server.  Start a character, /testbuff them, and
jump into some adventures.  I'd probably need to start a character of a
class I'm familiar with, though.  No need to inflict a 'suddenly lvl 25'
chanter on a group.  "Hey, I wonder what that spell does?" ... LOADING,
PLEASE WAIT .....  ;-)
