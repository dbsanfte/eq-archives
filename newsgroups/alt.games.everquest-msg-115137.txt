I cant help it.. i REALLY think this dude is an assh***...

Just cos he managed to help keep the MA alive, it is ok for him to "naah. i
did my bit.. fuxor the rest of you"..? What would you say if the enchanter
started.. "Nah.. i dont want to mezz in this fight.. you are all nagging me
about it.. why should i.."
GET REAL!! You are a druid... EVERYONE should use their abilities.. right?
Should the melee's just say.. nah.. i will just use my rusty longsword
tonight.. banking the other one.. why? "because you all are nagging me cos i
did not instakill that mob".. (/em crying like a big baby)

If you have an ability that makes it possible for you to transport people..
that is what you should do.. I am not saying you should run all around doing
only that.. but ESPECIALLY the example above.. how the hell can you be such
an suxor to not bind, and then help everyone out after a fight like that??
Is it REALLY possible??? If i grouped with you, and you did that to me..
hell.. i wish i will never come across your ass on any server tho..

I think druids are kewl.. most of them (thank god to that) is nowhere near
half an assh*** as this guy..
