Well, I can only provide anecdotal info.  I am a ranger, and there are
quests that require *interaction* with the guild leaders.  I.e.
dialoges, them giving me items, etc.  Also, I have to train with the
guild trainer.  Without trainng, you will not learn any of the paladin
skills.  Therefore, if you cannot do these things, you pretty much
HAVE to restart, if you want to really do anything later on.  Also, if
you know what youre doing, you can get from lvl 1 to 6 in about an
hour or 2.  Wish there was more I could tell ya.
