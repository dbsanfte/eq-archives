about 2 months ago, i spent all time logged on my monk with a 2boxed shaman
...shaman cast alacrity, 40% haste, so i didn't bother doing epic (i'll
probably go do it within the next month or so, since it only takes about
....2 hrs since i own RotLC)

epic gives nice stat boosts though, but not enough to account for the major
differences i discovered back then

no, my monk gets around 40dps fighting level 35-40 mobs (OT and DSP)

and so did my war when he was 35-45, and so does my ranger, right now

a gnome warrior friend, 56, using RBB and windblade, gets around 60-80
dps....i'll borrow his rbb and tell you if 9% more haste = 2x more dps

and...yes, i always make sure all persons i compare my monk with have the
same spell haste situation, whether it's 70% or nothing or bard haste

the other night, in PoI, with 70% on all of us....here's what i found

56 war = 80 dps (<--using windblade)
57 bst + pet = 70 dps (roughly 35 dps each)
53 ranger = 35 dps (<--using windblade)
55 monk = 34 dps


someone explain! when i told them we were parsing, everyone said "oh well
i'll do a much better job of stayign behind mobs, not breaking contact, and
not initiating atk until i know my atk will be continual" (not in those
words, but i could tell they knew most of the subtlties of squeezing extra
dps for parses)

and they did.....those numbers are an average for the night

i forgot the change in haste allowance

and c'est la vie, i guess i've just learned something after years of playing
casters....

still worth doing if i have 40% haste 24/7 ? just for the stats?
