I would also suggest to have at least one of the DA's mem'ed.  (Divine Aura)
That spell comes in really handy alot of the time!  Should also make a
/groupsay and a /say to say who you are healing %T.  Turn off everyone's
hits and misses, disable spell effects (cuts down lag ALOT).  Try to get in
the habit of targeting your group members by using the F1, F2, F3, etc.
keys.  Keep some spells memed in the 10 slot hot key area.  And a good point
as someone mentioned, make a /targ for the Enchanter and tank, this will
come in very handy, Enchanters drop like a rock.  (no offence to any of you)
Try to make a point of giving your mana status as much as possible.

Have lots of fun!!  Post back and let us know how it all turns out.
