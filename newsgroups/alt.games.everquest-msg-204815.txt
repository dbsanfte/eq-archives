Yes, unless you have easy access to get a second iksar child's tear should
the first try fail, I would have more people there.  We had a mage friend
who had duoed rak'ashiir with one cleric many many times, but when he
tried to do this for us, it was a horrific wipe and my husband lost his
tear.  The mage was horrified/stunned, and we concluded that resists must
have changed for his pets at some point.  Fortunately a kind GM returned
Rakyn's tear to him, but I wouldnt' count on that working again.

I think it used to work this way, but by the time our turn had come,
something was changed.

And BTW, my husband also skipped the Hole, though in our case it was a day
of doing the turn-in of the shield and dagger from Rathe Mountains
alternating with getting the gem from the lesser spirit and turning that
in.  Worked just fine.
