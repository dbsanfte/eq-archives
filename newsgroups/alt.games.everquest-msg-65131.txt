You know, in an ideal world- which this is very definitely not- Verant
might have considered segregating a server or three for the players of
the older versions, and not added SoL onto those servers at all. That
way, folks with the more up-to-date systems could play on the majority
of the servers, while the folks with the older machines would have a
place to play.
*shrug* There's probably all sorts of techie type reasons for why that
wouldn't work, and I suppose keeping a low-end option open might
reduce the incentive for some folks to buy the expansion, but it would
have been nice.
