Solo in DawnShroud is good xp from 31 -> 40.. I have been soloing there for
8 lvls and just dinged 39 now..
As the other poster said.. dont stick around Netherbian Ent, but go right to
the Sanctus Seru entrance.. No aggro (if you dont sit too near the fungi
there), no problem single pulling Zelniaks. The small zelniaks starts to con
light blue at 38, but the A zelniak is still dark blue.. Wolves are too hard
for the amount of xp you get (they hit hard, and dont give much more xp than
a large zelniak that is way easyer to kill)

Ill probably come back here as 45 or so to go against the tribals.. then
move on to the rockhoppers.. Generally DS is a good area to fight for many
levels..
