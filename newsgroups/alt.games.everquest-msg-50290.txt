 *I* think, you're remarkably entertaining. *I* think, you post the best
flames I've ever read, well thought out and remarkably well written. You
take your time and proof read each and every flame. You're an artist and I
can appreciate that, even if, no one else can.  This is the best you have to
offer the world.

Hats off to you, sir!
