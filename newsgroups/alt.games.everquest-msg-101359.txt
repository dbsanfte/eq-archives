  I've never really gotten "upset" about hearing it called crack, but I
don't think it's particularly funny (not necessarily offending, just not
funny) and just one of a few bits of EQ slang I've never liked.  But I think
I like "plz" even less.

  Since I play on FV and I think people should make at least a token effort
to keep things in genre, I like the term even less when I see it in game.
