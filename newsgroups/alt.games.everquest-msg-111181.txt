The problem I see, is that some people do reprehensible things, and claim to
be doing it in the name of <insert religion here>.  Some of them claim to be
Christian, some claim other religous backgrounds.  I can't say that I have
noticed many attacks on Christianity per se here in this newsgroup.  I don't
frequent many newsgroups, this one along takes up far too much of my time as
it is.  I am not saying that none have been posted here, just saying I have
not seen more than a handful at most.  I have not, as far as I recall, seen
any attacking Wicca, but I have seen some attacking Judaism, and Islam that
I can recall.
