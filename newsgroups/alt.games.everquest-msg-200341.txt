Believe it or not, there is a range slot item that drops in luclin that
has +5% 2HB. :)  The only question is whether I mind losing the stats from
my bow or not.

I guess the thing to do is very simple...get a 2hb...get the item...then
see if my ATK goes up significantly.  I think it is worth trying, though,
since I'll be losing the ATK bonus on Swifty.  Any guild I'm with is
likely to be a family guild, so making the transition from A Swifty-ranger
to a 2Hander ranger is going to be my own personal struggle.

I believe those are the mobs in question, based on a comment on Alla
so...well, I guess the next question is whether I even bother going for
Amy staff, or whether I shoot straight for the no drop Greatstaff of Four
Winds from BoT that I _really_ want.  With BoT becoming unflagged by the
time I start playing EQ again, I'll have easy access to the zone...just
probably more competition for Auliffe Chaoswind.  

Oh, is Auliffe a minion of Karana, my god?  I'mna feel really bad if he
is. :(
