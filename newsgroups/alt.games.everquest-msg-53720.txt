Make a set of large fine plate, dye it the most washed-out shade of
yellow, put it on a female ogre with green hair. Purty!

When I was in my teens, a human paladin, dressed in rose colored fine
plate, ticked me off by KSing from our derv camp when he wasn't even
getting exp. I recently saw him again. He's above 50 now, but was
still wearing rose colored plate...
