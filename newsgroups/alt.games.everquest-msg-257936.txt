I would have said "thanks for the advise" and kept on the way you were.  If
he'd have said it again I'd have said *let me do my job ok, CH is going to get
me agro and in this situation HOT is more effective".  
THAT said,  my uber pally friend told me EXACTLY how to heal him the first time
we did one of the planes:  "HOT me before I pull, and start complete heal right
after even if I'm at full health."   He was right.  
Lastly, he was accustomed to a higher level HOT than mine at that level, and it
didn't always work the way we hoped and he would be perilously close to dead
when my CH took.
