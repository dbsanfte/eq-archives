I think it is great that a higher lvl character can now join a companion but 
will this may make it harder to find a grp. Some players may of reluctantly 
teamed up with a stranger previously, and lets be honest some out there are 
immature or weird ) but now it will be plz help me 
guildies/m8s/sibling/partner.

I have had some varied and mixed experiences lately grping but still cheesed 
of lfg - now it is trying to find AQ4 grp.

Trying AQ4 solo
Lvl 21^^ grey, lvl 22^^ fine but little xp when I can find one and lvl 23^^ 
too hard, and I cannot venture in and find veternas I am sure - looks like 
another quest I may have to come back to when they are all grey (
