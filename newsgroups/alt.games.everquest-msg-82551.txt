Sigh...

Here goes:

One OTHER definition of Nazi:

Na�zi (n�ts, nt-)
n. pl. Na�zis
  1.. often nazi An adherent or advocate of policies characteristic of
Nazism; a fascist.
Now, to carry this further, here is a definition of Fascist:

fas�cist (fshst)
n.
  1.. A reactionary or dictatorial person.
Now, keeping in mind that YES, there are other, more severe definitions for
both of these words, it was in the above context that I chose my wording.
Also, keeping in mind that the thing that prompted my response to Tyger in
the first place was the ridiculous way he/she went about telling other
people that they were basically stupid for using the word 'Drow' to describe
their Dark Elves.  To say that you don't care for that term and you find it
aggrivating when others use that particular word is one thing.  To become
mean spirited towards other posters because they use the word is quite
another.

I suppose I should have chosen some other word aside from Nazi to describe
Tyger's posting.  It didn't occur to me at the time that other people's
vocabulary was so stunted and short-sided.  I should have just stopped with
the word 'anal' or 'fascist' but then again, I'm sure you or someone else
perhaps, would have found something wrong with those terms as well.

My initial response and I believe the other responses in this thread were
not aggressive, nor were they inappropriately worded.  I chose my words
exactly as I intended.  You read them in a very reactionary way...

And, in conclusion (I hope), in my family background we dealt with the
horrors of Concentration Camps and everything else that went with them.  We
lost several people in our lineage to Hitler and his madness.  This whole
thread is ridiculous and yes, I am sorry that I ever tried to stand up for
another, apparently new poster who did not realize his using the word 'Drow'
was 'wrong', and I'm sure did not expect to be replied to in the rude manner
with which Tyger chose to reply.
