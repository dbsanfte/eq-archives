I was just reading on Casters Realm how the Eye of Zomm is going to be
changed into a non-aggro eyeball. Here's the snippet from February 11...

"The Test Server was recently updated to change how Eye of Zomm
operates."
"Previously the Eye of Zomm could be used to aggro NPC's to attack and
was used for pulling mobs in certain encounters."
"As a result of this the Eye of Zomm has been changed to be non-aggro on
Test Server and this change should go live with this weeks patch."

Interesting.
Now I am not particularly miffed about this change. Heck I'm a Wizard,
now I actually scout around with the eyeball without trains galore
coming after me. But there are just two things that really really irk me
about this patch.

(1) For the last 3 years Wizards and Mages have whined and moaned about
The Eye of Zomm pulling aggro whenever the greenest of green mobs would
see it. We wondered what the point of this spell was if you couldn't
scout around with it, which we assumed was what it was for. Verant said,
"Tough, live with. It's meant to pull aggro and have monsters home in on
you like a heat-seeking missile." And we gave up and accepted it.
Now people are finding that it is a great way to pull stuff from a good
distance away with safety, and Verant does not like this. Now the
situation is, "Whoa! It's not meant to cause aggro and be a pulling
tool! Bring forth the nerf stick." And now the Eye of Zomm IS going to
become non-aggro. Well WTF. Does Verant only change stuff as it is
convenient for them? It took 3 years for them to decide this? And that's
what irks me the most, it takes something even more dislikable to Verant
just to make them fix something else. They couldn't just do it when
players asked them to.
Reminds me of the Bind Sight stealth nerf, which also worked
peachy-dandy for 3 years... and then suddenly had to be altered for
"balancing" (which they did not mention they just DID IT)

(2) If the Eye of Zomm is going to become a non-aggro eyeball, then what
the heck is the use of having the level 57 Wizard spell - Eye of Tallon?
Which is basically the exact same thing as Eye of Zomm except the
eyeball is invisible as to not aggro mobs (well mobs that can't see
invisible anyway). So now I can choose between a non-aggro eyeball and a
non-aggro eyeball that nobody can see?
