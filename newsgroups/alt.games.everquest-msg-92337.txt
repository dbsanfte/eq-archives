Simple. First go to a zone you can bind in (any newbie starting city,
fv, ot, shadowhaven) and either a) find the soulbinder and say "bind my
soul" to him/her or b) find a caster or healer class pc over level 12
(14 for healers) and ask politely if they will give you a bind. Your
druid will get the spell "bind affinity" at 14 and be able to bind
himself at will wherever he wishes; your warrior will always be limited
to binding in cities or a very few other locations and will always need
help to do it. The soulbinder in freeport is located in east freeport on
the steps of an inn between the south gate and the docks.
