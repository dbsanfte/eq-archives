On a bad day, I will treat a tell from a stranger in the same context as
spam email. I dont mind it so much actually if they just spit out what they
want... but its freaking annoying to get the "hail friend" approach, or the
"could you help me?". Sheesh, I havnt got the time to play guessing games,
or engage in chit chat with someone who just wants me for a service. Anyway,
I usually give them what they want, depending on my mood and their attitude.
I have 50+ enchanter, druid and cleric, and im not sure which gets spammed
most.

I always sow for free if I have it memmed. I think the druids in the tunnel
were a bit on the mean side. Thats fair enough, if thats how they want to
be, but they shouldnt expect to win any friends. I probably would have...
/auc seeking sow for a long run... will donate and come to you! pst
and got it for free
