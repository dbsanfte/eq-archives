Isn't the new server hosted by Blueyonder? Expect problems to start with but
Telewest are pretty well committed to online gaming (for the second largest
cable co in UK and 3rd largest Telco, they are, anyway) so I'd imagine it
will get sorted.

Haven't moved over myself...the few people, left,  I know on EQ are on
Bristlebane so I'll stay there.
