Actually, I do care.  Not very much, but the caring is there.  I hadn't 
really thought about how it looks in other fonts.  It's not the first 
problem I've had with it, though.  Once, in another newsgroup, someone ran 
a lovely newsgroup stats program, and I came out as the only poster who 
posted only 100% original text with no quoting. :)  This being a 
mysteriously erroneous result, he fixed the stats program to account for 
my odd predilection.

}that don't have the same size for every character including making it 
}much harder to read. 

Reading USENET with a proportional-spacing font!  Aggh!  Sorry, I consider 
that a sin.  Almost, but not quite, as bad as eating fish on a friday and 
pretending it's not meat.  Were I ever to indulge in ASCII art, your 
appreciation for my lovely pictures would be completely destroyed by such 
a font.

}What's wrong with ( > ) like everyone else?

There's nothing -wrong- with being just like everyone else, I suppose.  
But "}" looks really spiffy in -my- font(s).  And I do rather -like- not 
being like everyone else, and it seems a harmless enough way in which to 
do so.  There was also in my mind the idea that the standard ">" character 
might result in more confusion when discussing HTML.  Of course, "}" is 
gonna mess up a conversation about C just as much. :)

Your complaint, however, is duly noted, and I shall think on it.  Perhaps, 
at some point, I'll go to the trouble of changing it to something else, 
but I haven't actually looked at the man page for my newsreader in about 
6-7 years since I configured it that way, and I remember it being 
particularly opaque, so it may take some time to figure out.

I felt quite proud of getting it to do that.  I'm shocked to discover I've 
been annoying people for -years- and nobody ever told me!

But tell me, how would it look if I

Those also look fairly cool to me.  Would one of those be less 
troublesome?
