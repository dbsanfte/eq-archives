   I dunno Biz, that level of incoherence is actually fun to
read.  Anyone can leave off punctuation and use iffy
spelling and grammar.  But true grande-bizzaro ranting?  The
kind that obviously comes from deep inside, that by-passes
any hint of rational thought?  This is highly entertaining,
in a jaw-dropping OMG sort of way.
