I did that back when I had an overclocked celeron.  That box ran for two
years before I had to put the box fan beside it and when it finally died
three months later, it was because the mobo overheated, that 366
processor is currently running at 550 on my wife's machine. (That's how
badly Intel used to underclock things)  Unfortunately, hers is having
problems because I tried to get out cheap and bought a mobo with video
onboard, and it doesn't seem to be a big fan of overclocking.
