I have the N50, which I use as "bot control" for my 2-boxed cleric.

One popular use that I've heard of but never tried is an archery macro so
that a ranger can still move and talk without interrupting their constant
firing.

I was hoping to use the pad for more, but I ran into some serious
limitations to what you can do with it.  Dunno if those were fixed in the
N52.  One thing to remember is that you have to close down the software to
be able to patch EQ (only when it tries to patch eqgame.exe).
