My buddy is sold on playing a cleric so that's pretty much etched in stone. 
He's got a dwarven cleric at level 12 and he'll definitely be one of our pair. 
My guess is that the best to pair with him would probably be a warrior but I
don't have one and don't really want to start a char from scratch.  I have at
my disposal a 12 mage, 12 necro, 15 druid and 36 pally. Seems to me like the
pally/cleric combo would eventually be the best since the pally can tank a
little and they could take turns healing each other but it would obviously take
a while to catch the Cleric up to him.  The druid I'm guessing won't ever be
able to tank so he's not really an option.  Will the Mage or Necro be a good
option for the duo?  Can the Cleric heal their pets?  Will they be able to tank
enough to duo with?  Were casual gamers and while we'll try to pick up a group
from time to time my guess is that we'll be spending a lot of time with just
the duo.  Any suggestions are appreciated.
