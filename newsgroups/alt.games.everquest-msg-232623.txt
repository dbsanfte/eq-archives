Ok guys I created a high elf cleric, my strength is 65, with my armor and
weapons on I can't really pick up anything else without being encumbered.
Is this a bad thing for a cleric?  I know that at higher lvls I get strength
buffs, should I ditch this char (lvl 11) and start fresh?  Let me know,

Chris
