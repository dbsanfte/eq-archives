I'm not talking about neatly packaged categories.  I'm talking about the
*broad* generaly categories that make up the game.  Casters, priests,
fighters.  I realize you snipped that out so you could pin your argument on
one sentence, but it doesn't change it.

I'm well over it.  My beastlord will be wearing a fungi by this weekend.  :)

Prior to SoL a beastlord *could* wear the fungi tunic.  The non-existence of
beastlords does not change that fact.  The concept of you arguing that
nothing was changed amuses me greatly, though.

Someone buys something and then resells it at a higher price.  Their intent
is to make a profit.  Do you really need a signed statement from them before
you will comprehend that?  At least you weren't so brazen as to actually
dispute the intent, rather asking for proof of "intent" (you should look
that word up).

Again, *my* beastlord will be wearing a fungi.  Doesn't change my opinion of
the nerf in the slightest, it just no longer affects me personally.
