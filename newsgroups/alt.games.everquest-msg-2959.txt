If you need to sell something when you hunt in Oasis, go to sro and
sell there.

You're right, there is  a bank there.

An addition. With the warrens, you now have another potential "big"
city to train, shop, and bank in; Paineel.  200 kobolds will take you
from Threateningly to Dubious, I think you need several hundred more
to get the key from the guards, but it is worth it.  You also get
better faction with the Erudin guards.

However, as an Ogre, I am too big to enter Paineel without a shrink
potion.  When I get that, I'll use my 4 bags of Kobold Molars to see
if they will like me a bit more.
