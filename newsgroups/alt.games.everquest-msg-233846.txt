It depends on wether your ML is selling all the stuff and if you stay after
you win.
I was in one adventure where only one mob dropped like 6 copper and 2 silver
but once we won and killed a few more they started dropping 11-18 plat each.
Sometimes its worth staying. I know what things sell for. I ML as most of my
chars even my cleric who has yaulp 5 now so i dont lose any med time
looting. :)
Also you want your chanter to loot they have higher Cha and get much more
plat for items. Unless your group just blows my chanter has to chain nuke to
get low on mana.
I am almost sure that others keep the high selling bazaar items without
mentioning it to the group. :( Some of the tempers for instance cost more
than 40p in bazaar. And I've had splits where there was no small coin at
all. I just add your rouge looting ass to my list and won't group with ya
again enjoy the extra 50plat scumbag.

Anyway Hi Woland I'm from there too and I've grouped with you some as well
:)
