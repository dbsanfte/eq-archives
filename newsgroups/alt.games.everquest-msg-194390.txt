As a non-raiding shaman, let me put it like this: if I had to choose
between an item with 100hp/mana and +20 to all stats and saves, and
something with a focus effect but no stats, I'd be wearing the focus
effect item. Nothing else makes the same kind of difference, item
wise, not even Flowing Thought, except maybe some clickable effects.

I assume the same applies to the other casting classes, but I have no
experience with them.
