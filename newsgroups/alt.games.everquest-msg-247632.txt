I have seen a couple of spawns, and CoH seems to handle it in an interesting
way.  In EQ, static mobs spawn on their spawn points, and then stand there
until someone kills them, right?  In CoH, the spawn somewhere out of the way
(behind a stack of boxes, in a back alley, etc), hit the ground, and then
run to their "camps".  I've also seen "replacement" mobs run out of doors,
so perhaps some of the spawn points are in buildings that aren't used for
missions?  Either way, if you kill a mob out on the streets, you can stand
there all day and you probably won't see one spawn there, but eventually,
one will run up and take it's place.
