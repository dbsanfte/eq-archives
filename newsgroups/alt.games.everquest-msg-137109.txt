You're right, I don't get it.

*Why* is it one of the most powerful epics in the game?

The cleric epic is extremely useful in one and only one situation: helping
to recover quickly from a raid wipe.  If you have twenty bodies strewn
about, a clicker can get them all rezzed in five minutes, versus twenty
minutes for a cleric with KEI and BAotR going.

On an extreme situation... sixty people get wiped.  Without an epic... an
hour of rezzing.  With an epic... everyone's rezzed in five minutes.
However, the problem with such wipes is usually *not* the rate at which
people can be rezzed... it's the rate at which bodies can be recovered.
Cleric epics don't mean squat when the Emp is camping your corpses.

I honestly fail to see why adding 100 cleric epics to the server in the
coming month would unbalance the game.  It's a nice toy most of the time - a
way to quickly give out rezzes to folks as you're passing by, or to rez a
groupmate without having to switch spells or lose the modest amount of mana
a rez takes.  It's a time-saver, which epics *should* be.

But it's not something that will unbalance the game.  Especially in today's
world of KEI, BAotR, FT items up the wazoo.

Tell me, Ridah:  why do you think the cleric epic is so overpowering?
