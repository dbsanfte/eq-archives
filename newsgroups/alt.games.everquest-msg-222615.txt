Veksar... Hmm... Isn't this where Funji drops? I have a friend with a
level 57 necro and he says to charm the boss of the zone )since he is
undead and you can cham the undead) and have him kill everything and
then kill the boss when charm breaks. Easy fungi farming he says.

I maybe wrong but, I have never gone to this zone with my 53 druid.
However I may request that in the guild raid board after i get my
eulisian raid granted :)
