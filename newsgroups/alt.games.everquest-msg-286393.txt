- To help balance the way healing items work from class to class, 
healing-based AAs no longer work on heals cast from items.  Items that 
cast healing spells that are not castable by normal players and were 
previously affected by healing AAs have had their healing amount 
increased accordingly.

Unquote.

So... it seems possible that items which proc heals and lifetaps are not 
supposed to benefit from AA.  Or its possible that only clicky healing 
items would be affected.  Or its possible that the AA which affect 
lifetap heals aren't the same as ones that affect heal AAs.

Or, well, its possible that I have no idea what problem they are trying 
to address, or whether or not they've been successful.

For me, without any reading of other forums, it looked like they wanted 
hybrids AA's to stop working on weapon procs.  I can assure you that at 
this point, a nominal 100 point lifetap proc off a weapon will be 
affected by my SK AAs such that it can double damage for 200 and heal me 
for 200, or it can do 100 damage and double heal for 200, or it can 
double damage for 200 and then double that heal for 400.  The AA in 
question don't SAY they will work on procs, but they do.

IF you've got some official source from SOE clarifying what they wrote 
in the patch message, I'd be happy to hear it.  From what they actually 
wrote though, well, I think my trepidation was justified.
