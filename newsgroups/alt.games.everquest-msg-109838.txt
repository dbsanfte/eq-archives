I play a few classes, and the Shaman is my only character I played to
the 35+  (great choice for a class btw).  I find the Shaman the most
fun and versatile class to play. Why you ask?

Here are the reasons:

Sow at lvl 9: makes life much easier
Buffs, Buffs, and more Buffs (you will be a solo machine)
Debuffs (the fights will go much easier)- Speed yourself, Slow & DOT
the Mob
Very group friendly
If you want to Bash stuff (solo)
If you want to exp fast...Group & med
Wolf Pets
Bear Form (New Luclin Spell at high 20's or something- before you had
to wait until 50(?))

In terms of Race:
I play a Barbarian because I wanted to be non-Kos in most towns-
however, I played an Ogre at first until around lvl 11 or so.
If I had to do it again- I guess I would have stuck with the Ogre:
can't be stunned from frontal attacks (not a big deal- but nice
anyway)...and dey r strong!

Where to put points? Max out Wisdom!!!- Wis items are expensive and
the more mana you have- the better. As for the rest of the points? Not
sure- depends on race.

Read eq.castersrealm.com - they have nice "character creation"
articles and give some pros and cons of race.  Info might be outdated
now though (don't know) other than I created my Monk character based
on this- and learned since that I should have thrown remaining points
into Stamina. Bah- not a big deal, still fun to play.

Have fun with the Shaman- one of the classes (I believe)- that you
will be able to play to 60 and never get "stuck" if that makes sense.
You can always find a group when you need one- else just Solo away.
 <grin>
