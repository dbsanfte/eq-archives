Well, thats silly.

The paladins should have been ready to heal (lay hands) before assist was
called, and then melee once the fight began in full.  If they still had lay
hands at that point, they stop attacking and target the main tank as the
person before them uses it.

Generally a failure in the patch healing.  (Druids and shaman and non
rotation clerics doing fast heals)  The most dangerous part of most raids is
the first ten seconds, before the healing can fully get in place.   If
they're saving thier mana to nuke, or not paying attention, or anything
else, the main tank is usually dead, and your raid is in a very bad
position.
