Whoa, back the train up.

At low levels this is true.  But by level 25, I was able to make my KEI costs
quite readily, at 33 I make far more cash per hour than I spend on KEI,
assuming I loot at all (as a twink, mind you, if I'm grouped I don't loot at
all)

Hmm, no, that doesn't necessarily compute either.  Mana conservation is -not-
a vital skill at low levels with KEI.  At 15 I could chain heal till I got
aggro and still not even cause a blink on my mana bar.  There are more things
in the game to consider than mana conservation, and with no clarity at all,
you may not learn about them because you don't have the resources to do so.
Now at the higher end, as mana conservation becomes more and more important,
your arguement holds more water, but you really aren't likely to see "level 45
cleric that didn't use KEI back when he was 25 LFG".  This starts to get
pretty darn subtle.

Further, KEI means not needing a chanter in your group.  Given the low
availability of groups anymore in the low levels, being able to use alternate
group constructions without losing the mana regen seems like a plus; yes,
Clarity will do fine at 30, but only if you can find a chanter.  Begging a CI
isn't going to work, not because its not enough regen, but because the
duration is so much shorter.

That cleric goes to Nexus for C3... take a 5 minute break and he's back for 3
hours of play time.  Compare to an extra minute of down time on every pull or
two... wow, points to the C3.  There's a reason people buy this stuff, its
because it actually works!

Here, I'm with you.  I like KEI, but I can live without it.  Heck, I can live
without Breeze.

BUT, what I can do changes radically depending on my mana regen situation.
Want to chain pull red mobs in a group where the tank is 10 levels higher than
me?  Not unless I have KEI.  Want me to help in a group my level and lower,
killing mobs that went blue to us all 5 levels ago, but are nice exp when
chain pulled?  Heck, not only don't I need KEI, but if I did have it the only
difference would be I'd be able to train my melee skills cause I'd never have
to sit down anyway.

Note of course these refer to my shaman, not my cleric, who was level 55+
before ever getting a KEI, and 58+ before KEI vendors became a fact of life,
and has to my memory never paid for a KEI.  Shaman on the other hand has had
KEI at least 50% of the time on almost all of his 34 levels, and probably will
continue to do so, as the spell gets cheaper and cheaper as a function of his
"gross domestic product"
