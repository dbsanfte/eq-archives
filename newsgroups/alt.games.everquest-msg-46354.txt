So there I am sat, 2 books down, a mad wife, caffine fixed and a pile of 
broken match sticks.  But whats this ... an armored figure, I've been 
awake too long... OMFG!

He'd spawned, I fell off my chair....

Then I got beaten, the live grimrot is not a casters dream mob.  Brell 
gave me strength as did a passing ranger (*hugs* and *cheer* Jakara of 
Primordian, a striking wood elf on Tunare, I am a believer of 
reputation, so many thanks Jakara, your help was truely lifesaving) and 
so Grimrot was mine.

So half way through my camp & 6 days down I took heart, well his sycthe, 
the heart was yet to come.  My camp was to come to end much sooner than 
I thought, I grabbed some well earned sleep and placated my family..

I started early the next day and on the second spawn I sight the dead 
grimrot and finally my quest draws to a close.  A Dot, a root and a DD 
and once again Grimrot was banished from norrath.

This has been a long camp, certainly the longest I have ever undertaken 
in the game.  So I just wanted to thank all within this newsgroup for 
their comments, those that passed by in game & stopped for a chat and 
Jakara for saving my butt.

For all that are thinking of visiting the Southern Karanas to visit the 
local sk, bring a book, have patience and retain your faith.

One darn proud bearer of the Aegis life

:)
