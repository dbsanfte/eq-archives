	2 slots per pack, 8 packs in the bank means 16 extra slots, which means 2
more packs, effectively.  Venture's bank space is full decked-out in 10-slot
containers (one being a Deluxe Toolkit so it can hold my Rebreather) and I'm
still pressed for space.  My bank mule is only using 8-slot packs and he's now
carrying one pack on him, meaning he REALLY can't leave Freeport...though now
I think I'll risk the run to NRo for sewing kits.

	It's a nerf.  The full effect hasn't been felt yet though.  Yesterday when
I retired the 10-slot I was using to hold arrows and spare parts in favor of a
Thunderhoof Quiver, I put it up for sale at 80 pp and had four offers in less
than ten seconds.
