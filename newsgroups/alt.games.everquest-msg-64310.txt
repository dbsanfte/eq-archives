Question for group,

Ever since I downloaded batch all text in chat boxes are blacked out.  Even
on the buttons ie bash, bind, beg are also blacked out.  When I first log on
and the screen comes up where it displays the list of characters, to choose
the one you want to use to enter the world my characters name is also
blacked out.  Has anyone had this problem?   Anyone know a fix?
