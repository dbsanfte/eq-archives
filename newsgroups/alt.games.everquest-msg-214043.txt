Pets all have a fixed delay of 30, haste spells and items will change that, but
weapons will not, neither for good nor ill.

Pets also have a natural max damage, each time you get a higher level pet spell
its max damage also goes up.

Hand your pet a weapon and he will either keep his own max damage, or get a new
max damage of twice the listed damage on the weapon, whichever is higher,
without changing his delay.

This means the ideal pet weapons are ones with high damage and high delay.  High
damage low delay weapons would be just as helpful, but these tend to be worth a
lot of plat, since delay is irrelevant for a pet, though, really really slow big
hitters work just as well as really fast big hitters.

I recently discovered what I believe is the ideal pet weapon; the Fist of Bone.
Its a monk/beastlord only hand to hand weapon, but for some reason my mage pets
were able to weild it anyway.  It has a long delay (50?) but a damage of 10.
This is similar to the Rusty Two Handed Sword which is the classic pet weapon,
but the 2 hander costs over a plat apiece from vendors and is extremely heavy,
so carrying around a backpack of them is prohibative.  Fist of Bone from a
vendor will run you just a couple silver, and as befits a monk weapon its pretty
light, under a pound, so carrying a bunch is no problem.

Its drop only, off mobs in Shadeweaver, so the best place to find it is on the
two vendors right there in Shadeweaver near the dancers.

Barring that, another decent weapon is the Rusty Scythe, which has a 9 damage
and some obscenely long delay; if money is an object though its significantly
cheaper than Rusty Two Handers.

Once you get high enough level that your pet does more than 20 damage
"naturally", giving him a weapon is unimportant save for the look for quite a
while. Eventually he may get Dual Weild, at which point you'll want to give him
two weapons to activate that skill; the quality of the weapons for that is
irrelevant, though, as he'll be using his own damage output.

There are some weapons that drop with a very high damage and delay, when you can
afford to drop 20pp or so on a weapon you can still boost damage up a bunch,
most people don't do this much though.

There are also weapons with procs; when the pet (not the player, the pet) is
high enough to get the proc to work this can be interesting, a classic is the
Gnoll Hide Lariat, which procs a stun; giving pets a pair of these can really
make a difference in a fight, because he'll ignore the crappy 3/19 ratio on them
in favor of his own damage, but will still get the procs.

Pets will also use shields, wear armor, utilize haste items... for the most part
you'll only be interested in doing that if you have access to a mage for
summons, real gear tends to sell to vendors or players for so much cash that you
won't want to waste it on a pet; remember anything you give that pet vanishes
when he dies or you log out or zone.  Mages can summon them a partial set of
plate armor, several HP items, a haste item, proccing weapons... really hook you
up if they want to.
