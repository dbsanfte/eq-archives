I hate this justification. With a passion. Those that used it were
almost certainly guilty of similar scams themselves. It takes two to
scam. Yes, the victim should have paid more attention, BUT, the
scammer is the one who created the situation in the first place. The
scammer is not blameless because the victim "didn't pay enough
attention". Try that defense in court in an RL situation, and watch
how fast the judge throws the book at you.

As for the "he didn't advertise it as an ornate mold", that's
bullshit, too. Simply by pricing it as he did, he was obviously hoping
to fool someone into thinking it was an ornate mold. It was "implied"
advertising, so to speak.
