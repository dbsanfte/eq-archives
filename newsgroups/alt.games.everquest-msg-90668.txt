True, but how often do you call tech support? I have always been able to 
  solve my EQ problems by looking at this NG, the boards at VI 
homepages, or the chat feature.

> Provides 1 non US server for the thousands of non US players.


Well, i only know 1 person who moved to AB, and he dont see any 
difference in lag/lds than on the US servers.

And when they do the emergency patches after normal patches it bother US 
players but a lot of non-us players are not bothered because they gone 
to bed by then, or are at work.
And if they didnt patch all the servers at the same time, whats to stop 
you from patching from AB server, then run the updated zones on another 
server, and then get MAJOR problems due to conflicting versions?.

Again, try to look at the boards, you get plenty of answers there, no 
matter what country you live in.

> Doesn't advetise or make the product widely outside the US. 


Errr, i still see adverticements in magazines and in stores. Dont know 
what non-us country you live in, but in Denmark EQ got as much (or more) 
adverticement than most games.

> Sets up great conventions for players in the US but nothing for those outside the US.


Not sure on this one, but didnt they plan a convention in London?

Star Trek is OLD by now, and got a much lager fan base than EQ.
If i go to my local movie store, i see maybe 1 copy of a star trek 
movie. If i go to a software store, i see a LOT more copies of EQ. As i 
see it, that make EQ much more available than Star Trek.

As for conventions, did Star Trek have conventions all over the world 
after 3 years? No, didnt think so. Maybe EQ will have all over the world 
in 20 years, when the fan base support it.
The general idea of conventions are MONEY. If you cant make money of it, 
you dont make a convention. You can hold a convetion in the US, because 
theres a larger fan base nearby, and people are used to travel. For US 
people its normal to spend 5 hours in a car to go somewhere. Here i 
Denmark i woulnt bother go to one if it was in the other side of the 
country (around 300 kilometers). That mentality means a lot more people 
would show up for conventions in the US, thus making it rentable.

I live in Denmark, and i still find you are a pathetic little gimp.

Why not, all of it are true, now go away.
