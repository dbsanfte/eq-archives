Eager to see what was change here.

Sounds similar to the changed befallen event.... except they are
making the event in a "Pocket Zone".  Looks like they are testing
their code for the new expansion.... Lost Dungeons.

Look forward to seeing the changes here

<<snip High end stuff I have not seen and tradeskill stuff which I
dont do>>

>** Spells **
>- Damage Over Time Spell Foci - Extended Affliction has been changed to Burning
>Affliction, which causes DoT spells to do more damage instead of having a longer
>duration.

My, necro, beastlord, and druid are very happy about more damage.

>- Kindle - We have added a new Magician spell to the game called Kindle.
>
>- Force of Akera - We have added a new Paladin spell to the game called Force of
>Akera.
>
>- Draught of Lightning - We have added a new Wizard spell to the game called Draught
>of Lightning.

Curious to see what these do

>- New Spell levels for Clarity line - Boon of the Clear Mind is now a level 44 spell,
>Clarity II is now a level 52 spell and Gift of Pure Thought is now level 56.

Now, what does this mean..   cant cast on peopel below 44 or that the
spell is now for a level 44 to cast?


>
>** Skills **
>
>- Sneak - Sneak will now work under water.
>
>- Instill Doubt - Instill Doubt will now work if the Monk is using his other skills.
>Previously, use of other skills such as a kick would cause Instill Doubt to fail.

about time for both of these to be fixed.

OMG, they do read the feedback... this is a great asset to a FD char.

>

Nice... always bugged me that it did the odd placement of gear

Good

Applaud... always hated that happening...   I use mouse look as a main
stay... and always sucked to be over a corpse when you stop Mlooking,
and game acted like that you were tryign to loot.


All in all... Id say a good patch, depending on what they broke while
adding this one.  I am dissappointed in the drop of the Referbed
zones... but Id rather them make sure they are working right before
putting em live.


good hunting all.
