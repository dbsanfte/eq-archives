This is the barrier I'm harping on.

Rent.  My early 20s were "starvation years".  I sold a lot of things I
would really like to still own.  The person I'm playing with now is
actually the person I sold my account to.  I contacted him and asked
if I could buy it back.  His brother had it and was being stubborn, so
the guy is now giving me a hand starting up and leveling his multi-box
characters with me.

When you say "Not WoW level of players, but then not everyone has a
brain and they prefer 'easy' games" you're saying people don't play EQ
because they think it's hard.  I'm saying people don't play EQ because
it's an old game that is infinitely less accessible at this point than
newer games.  That's why I went on about all that.

I guess that's the opinion thing.  I don't think EQ is the hardest MMO
I've played.  I don't equate "hard" with "tedious."  I don't think EQ
is purely tedious (I haven't really seen an MMO that lacked some
tedium), but it seems like most things that make it "difficult" are
just things that create tedium.

Honest question:  What makes EQ more difficult than other games?  Is
soloability equal to ease?  Does a harsh death penalty make a game
difficult?

I didn't really feel any MMO I've played was all that difficult.
Maybe it's just because difficulty and skill are pretty vague when it
comes to video games in general and MMOs in particular.  Some people
say twitch = skill, some say twitch is kid-stuff.  The main skill I
see in MMOs is just the ability to corral a large group of people and
get them to hit the right buttons at the right time.
