Yeah, but it's not much good except for OTHER players
of the SAME class...no necro scribing FD for a really
rich warrior or a Cleric of E. Marr channeling mana into
a scroll that just needs to be "read" by a Ranger trying
to DA his way out of the Hole.  Chance of failure and all
that (depending on a "Read magic" skill or something
similar), and only for some pretty low level spells.
