You know, Mark, you and Jeff George are the two guys I had in mind
when I was hoping it was some usenet loudmouth westerner who took up
with terrorists and got killed in Iraq.

Maybe you are that whiteboy idiot with the fake arab accent who
released the "blood in the streets of America, God willing" tape
earlier this week?

In which case, say hello to the guards down in Gitmo for me :D

Would it be considered abuse if they wouldn't let you play Everquest
2, as a detainee?
