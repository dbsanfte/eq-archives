Yes thats right.  Got my researchers badge and turned it in for the seal.
Gave the seal to the dying investigator and got it back.  One thing I
*might* be missing is a text trigger.  The investigator says "If Helminth
lives, tell him [I am dead]".  I haven't been able to get him to respond to
any "I am dead" type questions and haven't found Helminth either.  Maybe I
need to kill some placeholders?
