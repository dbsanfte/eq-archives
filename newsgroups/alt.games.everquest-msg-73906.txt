I buff, and sow, and buff and sow for free all the time.
"Sow Me"
"Buff Me"
etc... etc....

I've never accepted payment, but you know what?
From this day forward all "Wizards" are gonna pay.
You know why? Because I group with them, or meet them, and when I need
a Teleport...it's 20PP. 

No more grouping with them (until necessary)...etc...etc...

Okay...done ranting.
Flame away- don't care :)
