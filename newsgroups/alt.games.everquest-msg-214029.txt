Unless you have a spell haste I item, in which case Snare casts faster, but Ensnare is
not improved by Spell Haste I due to having too high a level and not by Spell Haste II
due to having too short a casting time.

But thats stretching to cover, really I didn't know the cast time on them and just
assumed that it followed the logical progression of most spells in the game, taking
longer to cast for greater effect.  The difference between 1.75, 2.0, and what, 1.5
for Snare with Spell Haste I?  is too small to quibble about, they all pretty much
cast in the same speed.
