Is fucking boring. I'm sick of my high paid, high pressure job, adorable
sex-addict girlfriend and... atrophied social life. Other computer games are
a laughable 2-day love affair, beer wears off too quickly, videos only last
a few measly hours...

I want Sony to hurry up and fix everything (Especially my poor forgotten
class :) so I can go back to comfortably wasting my life in a computer game
with a bunch of other dorks.

Oh and the fact that my FAREWELL post was the FIRST here to receive no
flames.... well it's just typical of you guys. Typical.

Love to all,
James
