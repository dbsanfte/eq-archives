All classes can solo, some just have a lot harder time of it than
others.  Scouts have a lot harder time than tanks, which have a lot
harder time than healers.  Not sure where mages fit in, but I believe
they are pretty easy to solo with also.  Scouts have a tough time of it
- and watching one struggle with a green/blue con next to a priest
taking out a yellow/orange con without breaking a sweat is
disheartening.
