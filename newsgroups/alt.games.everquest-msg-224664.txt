The fastest xp I've ever had has been in Kurns from level 12-18 or 19.
 Whenever I go into PC there seem to be disputes over KSing etc ...
not worth the hassle.

Pre level 12 the lips of the field of bone are good.  Level 12 fight
in the entrance hall of Kurns.  When you feel comfortable there go
upstairs and when you feel okay there move into the basement.

One question ... what level is the lower basement (down the drop) in
Kurn's suitable for?  Never done that because of the one-way nature of
it.
