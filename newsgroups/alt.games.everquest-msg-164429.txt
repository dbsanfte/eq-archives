I would really hate to get into this sort of debate; its certain to
devolve to flames in record time.

But I must say one thing: there is a reason people call the US
imperialist. Unlike the UK its not politically sanctioned. It's
economic imperialism. In some ways its even worse than what the UK
did, because in the 1800s they may have indulged in imperialism but
they took responsibility for it too. The US, on the other hand, just
wants to open up as many markets to their multinational corporations
while apparently keeping their hands clean.

But, this is sort of likely to draw the wrong kind of debate for this
forum, so thats all I will say.
