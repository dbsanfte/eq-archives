(1)

I said: "Nope.  Not a chance.  You'll find *very* few Rogues who would want
that."

This is a statement of statistical fact.  The question has been raised a few
times over the past 3 years at The Safehouse, and every single time a large
majority of the rogues who responded were against it.  I don't know the
exact percentage, but based on memory I'd place it as well over 10:1.


(2)

You said: "This implies that the RL players want their characters to be able
to rip off their groups".

It implies no such thing.  What it actually implies is that the RL players
involved want SELF-control to be the guiding force, not external control via
a tattle-tale subroutine.

Of course, "it" implies neither one.  Either that or "it" implies both, and
you've simply chosen the implication that best feeds your prejudice.


(3)

Wrong.  I stated the opinion that over 90% of rogues would leave if such a
message were added.  The majority (I believe) would do so due to such a
belief.  Others would leave because of losing friends, or because of the
idea of "voting with their pocketbook", or other reasons.
