I figure it's more "realistic" to have armor and weapons the
deteriorate or occasionally break. All my jeans and t-shirts wear out
and I have to go buy new ones if I don't want to be walking around
wearing rags. The tools in my toolbox occasionally break if I misuse
one. They also wear out or get replaced by something better. I don't
think we're going to be forced to replace weapons and armor very much
more frequently than most people do already.

>2) Localized banks, while realistic, are a paint in the ass.  IOW, not fun

Agree. I like being able to go into the bank in any city and see the
same inventory there. Unless there's some way to port or gate back and
forth between cities to access "your" bank, I think localized banks
will be a huge failure.

Me too. I have no desire to "own" property that will likely require
maintenance and your regular presence. I want to wander the world and
see it all. What is the benefit of having a house? What am I missing?

I'll be in EQ2, definitely. But, probably not SWG.
