Multiple reasons.

1)  It lets me know if I'm not attacking for some reason.   Usually a
misclick that left me targeted on a pet or player instead of the mob.   I
can tell at a glance that something is wrong, since the battle spam isn't
flowing, and correct the problem before the mob loses interest in me and
goes to beat the shit out of the cleric / druid who kept healing while I
wasn't attacking.

2) I set up my combat spam colors so I can easily tell when the mob is
attacking me and when it isn't.   My hits are white, enemy hits are red,
enemy misses are grey.  It can sometimes be hard to tell if the mob is
attacking you and missing, or beating on the shaman standing a tiny bit
behind you.   But I knew as long as I had gray / red text still flowing, I
still had aggro, and didn't need to burn taunt.  (HoTT has covered this, but
that ability was added 3 years after split chat windows ; ) )

3)  It lets me keep track, in a general way, of how many times my aggro
procs have gone off.   If I haven't seen a proc for a while, then I need to
think about doing an Incite taunt move before I lose aggro.

And perhaps most importantly...

4)  I like seeing the combat spam, even if I don't always pay solid
attention to it.   I enjoy seeing how much damage I'm doing, general amounts
of damage, how hard the hits are, and whether I'm getting lucky rolling
crits or not.   It also allows me to feel more connected to what is going
on.  I see actual, concrete results of my attacking...  not just I hit
"attack on" button and sit there watching a slider count down from 100 to 0.
