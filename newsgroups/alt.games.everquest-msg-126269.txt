I am an enchanter. By way of example, there is Color Flux (lvl 4 stun) and
Color Shift (lvl 20 stun). When a spell is cast at a MoB, do they resist
based on the spell level or the caster's level, or a formula of both.  In
many cases, there are higher levels of the same spell effect which become
less mana efficient if caster level is making the difference (use the lower
level spell instead). Anyone know which determines the MoB's likelihood to
resist the spell?
