And?  Warriors need a variety of weapons to be considered "complete" (DPS,
aggro, piercing/slashing/blunt for certain events, etc.) but can get by with
just one.  I know from experience that it works the same for casters in
regards to missing spells.

In other words, runes are just another piece of equipment, and *belong* on
the same system as weapons, armor, and augments, or at least definitely do
*not* need to give casters anymore preference than what they already receive
by being able to claim "need" in many groups for longer.
