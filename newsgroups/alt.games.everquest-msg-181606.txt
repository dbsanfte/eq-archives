There's a soft cap at 255 (With AA you can get it to something like 305).

Every point of wisdom over 200 adds something like 6 mana (for some reason I
keep thinking it's 5.8) to your mana pool.

Every point of wisdom below 200 contributes <your level> / 5 mana to you
mana pool.

In many cases, once you're over 200 wisdom, raw mana is better than wisdom
on an item.
