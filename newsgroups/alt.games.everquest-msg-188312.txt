Speaking of KVM switches, I'm kind of surprised no one has offered a switch
specifically designed for gamers.  For example, have *two* monitor
outputs.  One always gets whatever computer you are working with (e.g., the
computer that currently has the mouse and keyboard).  The other could be set
to a fixed one of the computers, or could be set to show the computer you
last switched from.

There are switches called "matrix switches" that would allow that effect,
but they are more general (N computers, M monitors/mice/keyboards, and you
can basically put any computer on any one of the monitors/mice/keyboards),
and cost a lot more--they typically start at around $1K.
