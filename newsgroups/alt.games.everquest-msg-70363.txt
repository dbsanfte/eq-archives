I just got a used Dell L400 with a 700mhz PII, a ATI Rage Mobility-M
with 4megs of video memory, and 256megs of RAM.  I thought, to hell
with it, I'll try to install the old world EQ on it.  It loaded up,
got all the patches, and logged on.  I got to the character select
screen.  It looked nice, but it took maybe a minute, minute-and-a-half
for the my character to make one full rotation.

I didn't even bother logging to the world, I just uninstalled EQ.
