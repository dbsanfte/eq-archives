No it isn't..

But YOU are (or at least you were) advocating showing them AIDs and
HIV  *WITHOUT* them asking a question about it.

Yes, if a child is curious and asks questions, then such questions
should be answered in a manner befitting their age.

However, that is not what we were discussing, were we??

You are advocating volunteering such information to a 2 yr old.

And, despite your stated credentials and experience, I doubt there are
many 2 yr olds who can handle such exposure.

Nor can I imagine there are many parents OF 2 yr olds who would WANT
their toddler exposed to it.
