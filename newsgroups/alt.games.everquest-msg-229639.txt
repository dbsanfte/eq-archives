I decided to try Discord out and made a Shaman Frog.  made my way around to
do the newbie starter quests. when I got to the banker part, he was not in
the bank. 2 scruples frogs had trained the banker in front of the guild
master. they would hail guild master . afterwards turn around hail the
banker to get the 5 gold. then proceed to attack the banker to respawn back
infront of guildmaster with no quest flags.and start all over again. they
had to have had 20 or more corps between the 2.
