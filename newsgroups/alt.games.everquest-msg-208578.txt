When I browse the sales window, I have noticed that some traders have
multiples of unstackable items for sale. These show up as a bracketed number
(*) at the side of the name of the item.

Acryllia reinforced scullcap (5) for example.

I myself have 8 unstackable coldain heads for sale, but in bazaar window,
this only shows up as (1)...

I have them placed in  the trader satchels in various slots, so my questions
are...

1, Should multiples of unstackable items be placed in any particular slot of
the trader satchel?

2, Should I be doing something else in order that buyers will see that I
have more than one of an unstackable item for sale?

3, And if so, what should I be doing.

Thanks to all in anticipation.
