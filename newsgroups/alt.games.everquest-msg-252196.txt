It's in the O P T I O N S, as has been mentioned many times in this thread.

Sorry to hear about your death, though. If it helps, last night I was in an 
LDON with guildmates- 4 65's, me (63 cleric) and a 58 warrior as the MA(!). 
Did I mention no slwoer? Yeah, no slower.

We barely made it in time, because I was constantly having to hold pulls 
for want of mana. If we had not had a necr there we probably would not have 
made it at all.
