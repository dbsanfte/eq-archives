2 friends and I were farting around MM last night (Go RoS faction) and I
decided to use Sionachie's dreams and to be honest, Pixie strike is more
reliable.  I can usually keep 4 mobs controlled and with the Bloodwolves, I
could barely keep 2 under wraps much less the bitch of a wolf who popped on
my ass.

I guess I would say, I'm not sure that it's worth it to get Sionachie's
dreams when we get another mez in our 50's and Pixie Strike seems to be just
as good.
