You don't have to use ShowEQ...just read the various boards where ShowEQ
users discuss what they've found.  Although, there *is* a way to use
ShowEQ without violating the EULA, if you are curious.  Use it at work
on a LAN to watch *other* people play.

Anyway, there are various invisible mobs used around Norrath for special
purposes.  For example, the guy in Oasis that announces the boats is a
level 99 mob located past the mountains on the West end of the zone.
The place in Froze Shadow in the library where you take a few points of
damage when you walk over it is implemented as an invisible animated hand
that smacks you once when you walk into it.  By "invisible" I don't mean
regular invis...you can't see these things even with See Invisible on,
and they do not show up on track.

Some of the islands in Iceclad have several mobs of class "Invisible
Warrior" standing just offshore.  No one has figured out what these are
for, as far as I know.

Hate has some invisible mobs named "ShowEQ users are lame" standing
around. :-)

North Karana has something like 100 invisible mobs.  The guess I've
heard is that these are what cause the various messages about getting
sick, or having colds, or things like that.

Verant probably does it this way because they've already got the code to
have mobs say things at random.  So, instead of having to add new code
that every few minutes gives you a random message in NK, they just fill
the zone with mobs, and use the existing mob speak code.  Similarly,
instead of adding new classes of traps or other triggered things,
they've already got code for mobs to detect when someone is near and
react, so they used special mobs.
