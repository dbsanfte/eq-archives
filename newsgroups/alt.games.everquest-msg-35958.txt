I am guessing that the NPCs are there to be charmed by the enchanters,
and used to fight the other NPCs and the enchanters themselves. 

If spectators are there, it might be an easy thing for a. the NPCs to
aggro on the spectators, and b. the enchanters to charm someone in the
crowd (and apologize for it later- oh i didn't know he was a spectator).

If it was me in this tourney, I'd probably start out by mezzing myself,
which is a quick way to die.
