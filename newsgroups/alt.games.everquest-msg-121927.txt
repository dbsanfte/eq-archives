So most of my barding days have been spent in the great outdoors..
great not as in large but as in SELOS WORKS.

Indoors, I'm forced to travel at the same rate as everyone else
without SOW or Run AA... which is to say slower than mobs.

Chains is single target... and there's few and far between single
targets that I can stick a song to that are going to make
me run away.

Charm shakes one target... but if its late enough in the fight
that I've figured out I have to run, I usually have some mobs
too pissed at me to get them to fight the charmed guy instead,
so it only takes one mob out of the mass on my asterisk.

Pixie Strike... again single target.  If I have the time to Pixie
half a dozen mobs before beating feet, I probably could have
just killed them all with a charm/swarm plan.

Melanie's Melliflous Melody is hard to use indoors, although
I might experiment with it some more.  It always moves me
level or down, I never take falling damage, and I never go
thru walls.  Unfortunately direction seems to be random
and -then- distance is shortened to the nearest wall, which
means indoors it usually only ports me a couple feet, not
enough for a head start.  It also ports me at random, and
seemingly with random facing, so I have a hard time getting
my bearings and often run right for the mobs or at best stand
there long enough for them to catch back up while I spin
looking which way to run.

On the other hand, I had an inspiration and memmed my long
neglected Angstlich's Appalling Screech.  One hit of this and
most of the mobs on my tail are running off in random directions
screaming thier heads off.  In the long run of course this makes
for a godawful mess as those guys all find -their- buddies and
come back for me... but do I really care long as I've made it
to guards or the zone line?  Point is they aren't on me and I
have a head start to make sure they don't -get- on me.

An alternative would be Kelins Lugubrious Lament, hoping
the mobs would just stand there for a bit while I dash off,
really this would be a big improvement... but the stick rate
seems to be a lot lower than the Screech rate.  I also see a
note here that it works on a max of four mobs?  Is that correct?

Either song can be kept running as I scoot along, to drop out
new adds or mobs that resisted or have broken the original
effect, in both cases I need to make -sure- I've got it off before
getting near any friendlies.
