And (almost) a Shaman.  (Dude, can I have a Str buff plz)  (I need a dex
buff) (sow plz).  We once had a running argument in EC, where Druids and
Shaman were accused of being assholes for not SoWing everything in sight.
The response from us was, if you need SoW to play the game, create a char
that can cast SoW, no one NEEDS SoW.  The response from the slow classes was
along the lines "If you don't like casting SoW on demand, don't play a char
with SoW, it's expected of you, so quit whining".

(On a side note, when did the word become "whinging"?)
