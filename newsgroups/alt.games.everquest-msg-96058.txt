Clerics/Druids/Wizards and Necros have had some new spells implemented
on test, of course these are still in flux.

Of note, low level succor type spells for Druids and Wizards,
and a complete line of rez spells for clerics and paladins,
that extend from no xp at 19ish through 75% at 44 (IIRC) and
the current 2 at 49 (90%) and 56 (96%)

Also, cleric nukes have had there delays reduced, but their
recast delays increased.
