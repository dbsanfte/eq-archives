150 at the top, what i heard as of last week, by a guy who reads
berserker-class forums and found a thread describing what sounds like a fair
parse

only reason i'm not checking it is because it doesn't matter.....wait until
berserkers are fully outfitted (AA-wise) and then you may compare them to
the rest of the classes

and yes, please share your info

i once parsed regularly, about 4 months after PoP came out, and would like
to know what the numbers are at nowadays
