This entire subject is undergoing review by the folks at BioWare, and
is being discussed in the SOU forum (SOU is the first expansion - Bio-
Ware is doing the coding, Floodgate is doing content.  Floodgate is
mainly ex-Looking Glass folks).

The BioWare folks suggest exactly what Kaev does - strictly limit magic
items in your PW/Module.  However, as is discussed there, this does not
address scrolls.  In a PW, spell scrolls have to be readily available, so
Sorcerers/Wizards can get theirs when they level.  That also means
they are readily available to the melee's using UMD, so they have an
unlimited supply of them - as long as their gold holds out.

Just to show how broken that skill is in the NWN implementation (which
differs greatly from the 3e implementation) that 9fighter/1 rogue can
cast *9th* level spells (the highest spells in basic 3e).  A 10th
wizard can't.

Take a human fighter with int 10 as an example.  If he holds just on
skill point from leveling to 8th, when he hits ninth and takes a level
of rogue he'll have enough skill points to take UMD from 0 to 10 with
no cha or skill bonuses.  (rogues get 8+int bonus per level, UMD is a
class skill for them, meaning 1 point per skill rank, humans get a 
bonus skill point per level).  That 10 is enough to cast 9th level 
spells - with guaranteed success.

This is totally contrary to 3e rules - that same skill would give
about a 5% chance to cast level 7 spells from scrolls and a 50%
chance for it to misfire.

Hence, some people feel it should be adjusted a bit.
