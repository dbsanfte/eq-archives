    It's a player buff, gives the person a big DEX boost, a lifetap proc,
and scarecrow form. Sort of like Boon of the Garou, but cooler-looking.

    It is that messed up, so likely yes.

    You know, you hit it on the head. If these fixes actually fixed pathing
so mobs pathed logically, there wouldn't be any problems. But instead, each
pathing update introduces a whole new set of broken behaviours to an area,
behaviours that need to be re-learned. Fixing safe spots and stupid
decision-making by mobs is good. Replacing these features with new stupid
decision-making is bad.

    My 41 NEC uses the spires to go down to DL so she can hunt in the
combine ruins. Using the PoK book in FV, and then trying to run across the
entire Dreadlands isn't something I want to do.

    They gave them back zonewide aggro, like they used to have.

    You know, you may be on to something. If they turned the Obelisk into a
charm slot item, I bet it would still be useful to those that have them.

    Things like swords that had AC didn't display the original AC, just the
modified AC. I think the problem was specific to stuff that went in PRI/SEC.

    The effect didn't work because it was flagged "combat". Now, it does.
They've made this error quite a bit recently.
