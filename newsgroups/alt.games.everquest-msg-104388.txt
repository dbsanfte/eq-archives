It must be something in the air this weekend!

I'd literally JUST dinged 18 in the Warrens when a level 41 who was running
through slaughtering everything in sight (for faction I assume) shouted that
Krode the Diviner's shawl was up for grabs. I ran to the Paineel zone popped
out, sowed and camo'd, popped back in and ventured way further into the
Warrens than I'd been before ( I was mostly concentrating on the kitchen and
jail areas before.)

Against all odds I found Krode's corpse way through the back of a lot of
batlings. Yay me! All of a sudden "Bam! Bam! Bam! Loading , please wait..."

I reappeared just as I went to loot (and would have reappeared anyway when
looting which I'd completely forgotten!) Legged it out of there as fast as
my little sowed legs would carry me and actually made it as far as the
Muglwumps pond before the batlings hanging off every inch of my body finally
got me!

I hadn't even checked if Krode's loot is equippable or even useful to
Druids!

Trotted back through Tox buck nekkid and then, hoping to god that dragging
your corpse doesn't break camo, I reapplied it and went back in.

Found my corpse at the bottom of the pool, targetted and then sprinted for
the zone, clicking the corpse button at about the same rate as saying
"OhShitOhShitOhShit.."and keeping a very close eye out for messages along
the lines of "you feel yourself starting to appear"

Corpse dragging doesn't break Camo. :o) You knew that already but I was VERY
relieved to find it out!

Got my stuff back, killed Jailer MkRarrg a couple more times to re-ding and
called it a night before I decided to do anything else stupid!

Net Loss: nothing except dignity as my partner looked on and laughed himself
silly since it's exactly the type of thing he's famed for doing! :o)


Calmac.
