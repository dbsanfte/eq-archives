From eqcaster:

                    Level    Mana    Cast time    Max Duration    Resistance
check
Root             4            30        2.0            48
Magic+25
Enstill            20          60        2.5            96
Magic+25
Immobolize   39          80        1.75          60
Magic
PE                49         100        2.5           180
Magic

As Immobolize has a slightly lower cast time and lower resist check (and it
does seem to get resisted less in practice too), I tend to use it pretty
much exclusively, except in the rare cases where I'm doing crowd control and
need to park mobs for a while - then I use one of the longer duration roots
like Paralysing Earth instead.

For root and nuke, Immobolize is probably best unless you're fizzling a lot,
in which case use Root  - you're nukes are likely to break the root long
before the max duration expires anyway. Kiting is a better strategy than
root and nuke in any case, unless you are in an area with no room - just
keep a root handy for when BoF gets resisted.
