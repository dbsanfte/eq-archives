If we get the free tick that other HoTs seem to get it's
480HP over 36 seconds and a ratio of 2.4:1.  Pretty worthless
at 64 even before he gets Planar renewal, afterwords it's
not even worth considering.

and it's recourse
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3701

Basically BOIII combined with one of the shielding lines.

Considering he has Maelin (the top shield) and BOV (85% 
haste vs. 60%) it's also worthless to him.
