Inert potion quest in Erudin. You'll probably need to get more faction
with the quest giver first (he's from one of the caster guilds,
gatecallers or craftkeepers or something), but that is quite easy, just
kill heretics (killing Elial Brook about 15 times did it for my dubious
druid). After that, use one of the many methods to train the guy you
give the potions to so he stands near the quest giver then you can
mindlessly hand potions between the 2 NPCs a few hundred times until
you're no longer KOS. e.g, for a druid, bind yourself near Toresian
Fhabel the quest giver, whack Slansin the potion recipient and run SoWed
back to Toresian, when the now aggroed Slansin reaches you, root him and
port to Tox or somewhere, then immediately gate back to clear your hate
list. Now you can keep this NPC right where you want him by hailing him
every so often. If the quest doesn't work as intended, you've got the
wrong Slansin - you need an impostor to spawn who is stealing the
potions for a potion running racket, hence giving you lots of nice
faction with Norrath's criminal population.

You can hand potions between the two real quickly in overhead view with
'I wish to assist the great Toresian' on a hotkey.

This quest gives positive hits to lots of shady factions with no bad
faction hits. Allakhazam or somewhere should have more info.

If you're heading from Freeport to Erudin to do this, you may as well
take with you a backpack or two of Treant wood shards (from Jyle
Windshot in the Hogcaller inn in return for small lanterns) - giving
these to Emil Parsini in the hut just outside Erudin in Tox will give
you Erudin Merchants, Council and Guard faction.
