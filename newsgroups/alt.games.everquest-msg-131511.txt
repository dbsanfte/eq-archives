Ok. Used to have an occasional problem with this, but an EQ patch
somewhere along the line fixed it. Now it's back. *Every* time I zone,
as soon as I move I get massive sound feedback until I do /reverb off.
I can then do /reverb on (though it is not necessary) and everything
is fine until I zone again.

SB Live! 5.1

Any potentially useful suggestions?
