Lance, why don't you quit what you're doing and go into game design. If you
could get a team and pull off (with proper immersion) what you've outlined
you could probably beat out every other MMOG out there. LOL good luck
getting the funding though.

Sort of. There's some things along that line. For example, there's an
instance at the lighthouse you can only enter if you get a key (why a moat
rat would eat a key is beyond me). And yes, there are certain quests that
are non-repeatable (I believe the quest journal has listings of quests that
*are* repeatable). The problem lies with the other "reasons" for instancing
such as population control and development time. My wife and a I are
contemplating quitting because zoning into Ant3 or Oakmyst2 is beginning to
wear that immersion thin. They've swung that pendulum *way* too far to the
other side and used the instanced zones as a crutch for bad design and
overcrowding.
