There I was ...

My little gnome was enchanted with the idea of doing some race-restricted 
tradeskill improvement.  I mean, let's work on tinkering.

I got to 100 skill points, easily enough.  It wasn't cheap, but if my trader 
ever sells all the stalking probes I made, there's light at the end of that 
tunnel.  Now what?

Well, methinks, how about visiting Ak Anon for a bit of inspiration?  There, 
a tradeskill tasker gifted me with something unexpected.  Would I be willing 
to go yonder to Skyfire and lay to waste 80 of the foul wurms that roam the 
hoarry hillls?  Oh, and don't forget to loot 40 of their giblets.

I took this mission.  I'm a changed gnome.  The wurms are dead, and so are 
the subsequent drakes I was required to slaughter.  Yes, there was more to 
come after butchering the wurms.  For a lvl 56, this took time, death, and 
favors.

I earned a book; Masters Book of Gnome Culture.  It perplexes me.  Methinks 
I have no patience for this type of nonsense and wonder if I'm actually a 
halfling that was mistakenly switched at birth.  Somewhere there's a 
"halfling" desperately wanting to create fireworks in Rivervale, yet gets no 
satisfaction.
