Bittorrent is a distributed download client.  Your system is downloading 
  kinda random chunks (not in order like a normal download) from other 
people that have already downloaded them, either from each other or from 
the 'seeders' (seeders are machines making the whole thing available). 
(As an example of how it's semi random, if the people you 'see' have 
parts 1-250 of 255, your connection to a 'seeder' will download the 251 
to 255 first...)

It's a bandwidth saving option for the people providing the software.
Their bandwidth expense is running the bittorrent control server and a 
few seeder machines.
The downsides are some networks specifically block bittorrent traffic, 
and some don't work well with it. Also, a friend got eatten alive by his 
ISP during the WoW beta, because they use bittorrent and he has a strict 
upload cap on his cable. Plus it's generally much slower than a normal 
download.

Part of the basic bittorrent design is that your download rate is 
relative to your upload rate.

Is the official site, the program is open source though, so there are 
hundreds of variants. some of them charge or install spyware (or both)
I use http://krypt.dyndns.org:81/torrent/index.phtml
