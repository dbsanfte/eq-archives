Banned for?

You are so dissatisfied with Sony and EQ that you have more than one account?

>what the hell?!

Depending upon what you were banned for is probably going to directly affect
the amount of sympathy you get here...  

Before I say anything else, explain why your account was banned, then perhaps
we can explain to you exactly why Sony doesn't bend over backwards to assist
rule breakers that they have had to take action against...
