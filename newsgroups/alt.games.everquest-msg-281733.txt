I just logged on my bazaar mule and saw one for sale in the
bazaar.  Apparently it's not quite no-drop; it's attuneable.
So I logged onto my SK to check; he's wearing his, and it's
only marked attuneable, not no-trade.  My guess is that I'll
be asked to confirm attuning it if I ever take it off and
then try to put it back on (which probably includes looting
it off a corpse).

But it does mean you should have an opportunity to transfer
it back to whichever character you want it on.

What they DON'T mention in the patch notes is that they also
made it rec level 60.  Still not a bad item for a twink, but
not as clearly preferable to other level-appropriate items.
