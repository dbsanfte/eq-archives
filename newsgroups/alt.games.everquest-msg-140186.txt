Yeah, but if I were really concerned, I'd just mem my level 1, 15 mana
per cast, Snare.  It's a trivial amount of mana and a pretty quick
cast.

Oh, I agree that the Epic would be nicer if the effect didn't have the
snare component, but I'm not really gonna bitch about it.

I doubt that.  Ally is pretty slow to begin with.  There are mobs out
there that I can see that it would be a problem with, but it's pretty
trivial to work around.

I agree that the snare portion of the effect is problematic.  Just to
me, it's not all that big a deal though.  Opinions though, they may
vary.  :-)

Admittedly, I'm the kind of play that will probably never get his
epic, but still I feel fully qualified to talk about it. :-)
