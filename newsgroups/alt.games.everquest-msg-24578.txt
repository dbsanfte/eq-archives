	Agreeing with that, about 1k (or less with a guild jeweler)
	will get you a pair of vellum fire opal rings (+12 ac +130hp
	combined).  These will do a great deal to keep you alive
	(and thus leveling, rather than gaining the same XP over and
	over).  I've still got them at level 33, and they DO make
	a difference.
