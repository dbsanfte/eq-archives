Warriors add some decent damage, and if the shit should happen to hit the
fan, it's always nice to have one there, rather than the entire raid rolling
over and playing dead.   Anytime the person tanking the mob dies is a
critical time at any raid, true, but it is one that can be overcome.
Easily overcome these days.

When the shit does hit the fan, these days a warrior can get aggro if he
wants.  Allow me to introduce hotbutton 8. ; )

/1 I'm next tank!  TARGET ME FOR HEALING NOW!
/pause 30
/alt activate 110   (AE Taunt)

Usually hit right after hotbutton 1...  /disc defensive.

So each of those 4 or more extra warriors you have with you is adding some
decent damage, and each one has the ability to save the entire raid if
things go wrong.

For a hate / fear raid, or something of that level, enchanters are the lfie
and death of the raid.   On the "bigger" raids, very few things are mezed,
(or even able to be mezed).   We just throw one of those warriors on them to
keep them busy while the damage dealers slaugher the mob on the main tank.
They are still very useful on these raids, casting aggro modifiers and
runes, but not exactly critical.  (Other than the buffs, but these days 1
enchanter could buff an entire raid).

I take it as a bit of sign that the leader of the public raids on E'ci has
taken his level 60 enchanter to 1 of the last 60 or so raids, and his 60
warrior to the other 59.
