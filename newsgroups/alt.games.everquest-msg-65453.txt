The only thing that would make EQ totally unplayable is if the were
running Win95, which is a OS that is no longer supported by IT'S
MANUFACTURER.  Win98 will adequately run, IIRC, on a 486, so that
pretty much dumps 'not upgradeable' argument out the window (no pun
intended).

And as for 'can't afford to upgrade', I think others here have put up
more than one example of Win98 being sold places for less than $20.
And if a person can't come up with $20 to upgrade the OS, I think they
need to reconsider paying $10 a month for a damned video game.
