Rallos Zek:  Every man for themselves.  Kill and be killed by anyone and
everyone 4 levels higher or lower than you.  No faction hits for killing
anyone.  Loot coins and one item of your choice off your victims.
Newbie areas are insane on this server.

Vallon Zek:  Team PvP.  Four teams:  Shorty, Human, Elf, and Dark.  Teams
relatively evenly matched and warring against eachother.  Kill and be killed
by anyone from opposing teams 8 levels above or below you.  Coin loot only.
Take faction hit with merchants and guards of the race of your victim each
time you make a kill.

Tallon Zek:  Team PvP.  Started out the same as Vallon, but player politics
evolved much differently.  Dark Team is roughly equal to all the other teams
combined.  Freeport is almost constantly under attack.  Most on the "Light"
teams have banded together, forming an alliance to defend themselves, and
making it mostly a "Light vs. Dark" team server.  You can still kill members
of opposing teams within the Light Alliance.  Some individual thugs and a
few "terrorist" organizations among the Lighties will kill fellow Lighties
on opposing teams, disregarding the Alliance (for example, the guild
<Liberation of Underfoot>.)  It makes for some interesting politics
available on no other server.

Teams:
Human:  Human, Barbarian, Erudite.
Elf:  High Elf, Wood Elf, Half Elf.
Shorty:  Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling.
Dark:  Troll, Ogre, Dark Elf, Iksar.

Your personal style of play will affect which server you'd enjoy most.  I
like being part of a larger crusade/struggle, fluid politics, and being able
to use cooperative efforts to make a difference.  Therefore, I prefer Tallon
Zek.  It has some interesting opportunites for epic fantasy roleplaying.
Others who have differing tastes are just as valid in their choosing and
enjoying play on the other two servers.

Individual PvP (in my experience) is like a group of lone wolves constantly
duking it out in a dog-eat-dog world (EverQuest:  Road Warrior verson.).
Team PvP is more like being part of a larger struggle in a constant war
setting.  You'll occasionally run into spies, traitors, battles, skirmishes,
ambushes, terrorist acts, seiges, uprisings, etc. (though guerilla warfare
seems the most common.)

P.S.
As a side note, melee classes have difficulty working solo on these servers,
as it is a standard tactic to blind, snare, or root someone, step back, and
then fry them with a barrage of spells and pets.  Try melee-soloing against
Tovax Vmar when he's yellow to you, and you'll get a slight taste of what
it's like to be attacked by a caster in PvP :-)
