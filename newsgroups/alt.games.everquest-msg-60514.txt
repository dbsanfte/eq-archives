with the exception of Antonius, they are all in the US, and can't be too far
away from each other, as I've pinged almost all of them at random and they
consistently ping between 75 and 80 ms for me.
I can't possibly imagine Verant having them spread out across the US for our
convenience.  That would be much more overhead money-wise.  With between
300k-400k subscribers @$10/month that amounts to a measily $3-4 million a
month, so basically I don't think they could afford it.
