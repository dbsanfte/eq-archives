This pains me to ask but please stop giving free sows to high level
characters who obviously have the cash but refuse to pay for sow potions. If
they offer to donate, fine.  But as I sit in many zones hour after RL hour
not selling one single sow potion I am saddened by our Alchemy trade going
for naught. I put lots of time and money into Alchemy in hopes of earning
some serious plat but as you can see that is not the case.

There are even times that it takes me nearly 100p to make one 10 dose sow
potion and then I sell it for 100p. This even though sow potions are trivial
to me. Failures <sigh>.

Of course if the sow is for a corpse run then fine, sow away.  Why should
our tradeskill be different from that of druids and wizards TP spell?  These
will often TP for free if for a CR but you need to pay otherwise.

What sickens me is sitting in a place such as FV and auctioning over and
over sow potions and watching others sowing levels 35 and upward at the bank
for free.  Can't a character above 35 afford 100p?  Perhaps I am just
venting since I cherish my Alchemy skill and it is now wasted with a
backpack full of sow potions rotting in my inventory.
