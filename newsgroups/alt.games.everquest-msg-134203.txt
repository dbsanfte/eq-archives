It may not be obvious from the patch message, but all the race/class
combos on Feydwer now get some decent newbie armor quests.   There are
also new mobs in all of the Feydwer newbie/starting zones.

I tried out the High Elf Cleric armor on Test when they put it in, and
it's pretty good for low levels, nice little stat bonuses and a
teal-colored plate look.
