I have dual Diamond Monster, updated DX8.1,
updated vodoo drivers and the game works again now.
sometimes smooth, sometimes a little slower,
strange lag effects in more populated places.


330 Mhz PII 192 Mb ram, Nvidia AGP, plus dual Diamond Monster 2,
low end system by now.




I do not have Luclin, though.


download vodoo drivers from

http://www.voodoofiles.com/

look up center of screen, to the right,  top 10 downloads.

then go into diplay setup and ENABLE 3D3 Support!
may be disabled after installation!
