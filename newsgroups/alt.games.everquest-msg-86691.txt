	0% AA until level 60.

	Nothing, not even Innate Run, is as good as the benefits you gain from
levelling.  When you get to level 60 you will have plenty of blues and even
light blues you can farm for AA experience; you will actually get the points
faster than you would if you diverted EP to AA before 60.
