Besides not being able to complete quests if you don't find out about it in
time or it is added later, not being able to go back and farm "needed"
tools, such as bracer of the hidden, pegasus feather cloak, Jboots, fishbone
earring, etc., so you better get them while you still can.  Not that much. 
=P

I think they eased the restrictions somewhat, but the whole concept left a
nasty enough impression that I'm not interested at all.
