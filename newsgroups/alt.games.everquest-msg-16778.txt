Thats exactly how it works.

Also, the next logical step is that Character B could really use X item, but
would find it almost impossible to obtain, while Character A, being 20 levels
higher, can just waltz in and slaughter the mob.   So they actively seek out
the items to pass along.

Or *ahem* zero interest loans between your characters to purchase nice items
off of other players for the secondary character... that generally would
qualify as twinking as well. :)

A lot of people have good friends in the game that they either know in RL, or
have been online gaming with for years.  (Yes, I do mean years).  Theres only
a few people in my guild that I would even be a little concerned handing over
great items to them, and theres nobody in it where I wouldn't be completely
suprised if I didn't get it handed right back when my twink got there.
