I have to agree.  I play a wizard (lvl 53 now), but mostly because pre PoP
she was handy to my core group of friends.  If I was to start her over
today, she would be scrapped for a mage.

Mages do get decent nukes, comparable in alot of respects to mine at the
lower levels, and the pets rock.  Summoned items are extremely handy and to
be able to outfit that pet of yours with full suits of armor and weapons is
the cats a$$.
