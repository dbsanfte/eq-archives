They had vague plans to maybe do something like that (but only for
certain selected gear, I think), I think, but they dropped the whole
connection to your Everquest character, probably because it would have
been too much work for too little gain.  You can get an "of <server
name>" title for one of your characters if you reuse your EQ account,
but you can choose any server so it's not limited to those where you
actually had characters (not that creating a character on the server
would be much of a hindrance...).
