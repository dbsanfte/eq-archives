Level 70 Druid here, just PLed a mage to 63.

Used the same technique through 55.  Round up a whole mess of nasties:
undead, goblins, something that will auto agro regardless of greenness.
 Get good solid heal agro, pop thorns(lots of thorns), pots, etc.  keep
heal agro.  Mage pops 1 or 2x pbae.  Sit, rinse, repeat.

As the targets get higher, sitting becomes unneccessary, but healing
becomes more important.  Its actually easier between 25 and 50 than
from 10-25.  because heal agro is more reliable if you are taking
noticeable damage.  So through 25, the mage or caster does better doing
the tanking.  I've repeated this recently with a cleric and a beastlord
as the PLees.  BL just sets and slacks, Cleric PBAE, obviously slower
because 2x PLees.  but only by about 25% till 50, because of the xp per
kill cap.
