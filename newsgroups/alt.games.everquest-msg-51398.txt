Turns out it *was* a driver issue.  Nvidia released a new set of Detonators
like a week or so ago.  Got 'em, applied, 'em, runnin' 1280x1024 with the
clipping plane set to far - now I can see EVERYTHING ;-)

It happened so fast I didn't even catch their name.  No biggie; I mean, it's
not like you "die forever" in the game or something.  I'll just use that as
a learning experience and do as you recommend: note the name, then when they
come crawling for help, we'll talk (I'm playing a Paladin, so just turning
my back on 'em completely would be a bit out of character, which leads us
to...):

I saw a little.  I did a little bit; the people we were playing with were
putting us on the fast track to level 3 and beyond so there was little time
for "role play" as such.  We were trying to learn the game mechanics more
than anything else.  now that we've got the basics down pat we may give the
RP server a try, we'll see.  I'm just trying not to die at the hands of an
Orc every now and again!

Yeah, loot is always good.  I mentioned to one of our friends last night
that the game would *rock* set in an AD&D (1st edition) setting - can you
imagine cleaning out a camp with a nice Sphere of Annihilation? :-)
Seriously, though, I have no problem with loot acquisition.  A nice RP
balance is good though.  Thanks for the pointer about the RP server.  As
noted, I'll give it a try.

Yeah, we know these two IRL, so it works out well.  They'd call on the phone
and say "Where are you?" etc.:-)  I've had more positive experiences than
negative: two "strangers" cast healing spells on us in a pinch, and I helped
a couple of people out with combat.

Overall, it lots of fun.  I'm "Cinlayen", the wife is "Adaru" if you're ever
"in the neighborhood" (Feydark right now).

Thanks for the pointers and kind words!
