First let me say I love EverQuest the way it is.  The thing I want most is
for the gameplay to remain as addictive and challenging as it is right now.
All the changes below won't mean shit if Verant sacrifices the gameplay.

1) I want quests to matter.  Yeah, they're good for some faction, but the xp
and reward for the quests I've seen sucks ass after you get to fifth level.
Quests often involve zoning at least a couple of times, hunting many
creatures, finding Specific_NPC_9488 who's way over in the corner of East
Bumfuck, and other annoying things.  Finishing a quest should give a reward
commensurate with the level you have to be to accomplish it and the time you
put in.  If I have to spend hours killing 100 mammoths to get the rare-drop
loot I need to fulfill a quest, I want the reward for the quest to be more
than a gold piece, a trickle of faction, and an xp bonus that's roughly 10%
of what I'd get from one mammoth.  I know it's not quite as bad as I'm
making it out to be, but I think you should be able to progress as quickly
by doing quests as you can by soloing equal parts xp grinding and loot
farming.  After all, many quests are just as dangerous as xp hunting (if not
much, much more) and just as tedious as loot farming.

2) Changing world.  Asheron's Call operates on a calendar; new events change
quests, NPCs, even the landscape from month to month.  I'd like to see
something like that.  Example: "This month, Qeynos is under siege by gnolls
[an actual siege, not Fippy and crew]!  Lord Bayle will pay a bounty of one
gold piece per piece of gnoll fur, until the threat is ended.  There is also
a significant reward to whoever kills the Gnoll King and brings back his
crown."  Qeynos Hills and the Qeynos newbie zone would be crawling with
gnolls, roving bands of burlies and/or elites would aggro anything near
them, there would be more guards at the towers (or maybe some of the guards
would even be dead or MIA), the city guards would move to the walls or the
front gate, and some NPC in town would collect pelts.  People would fill the
area, plumb Blackburrow looking for the King, slay thousands of gnolls, make
mad cash off this for a month or two, and then things would go back to
normal.  The area would be quite dangerous to anyone under 15th-20th level.
Meanwhile, something else would be happening in another part of the world.
This could be very interesting.  In AC, for example, the towns of Arwic and
Tufa were reduced to rubble in a battle against the Hopeslayer (off-camera,
so to speak, but it's still an event).  Imagine trekking into Everfrost only
to discover that Halas is a smoking crater.  Or imagine your halfling
character finding a plain gold ring that carries a strange compulsion to put
it on constantly....?

3) Kickass graphics and sound.  EQ1 has the gameplay thing down pat.  When
it was new, I'm sure it was also impressive visually and aurally, but now
its bones creak and its voice is thin and wheezy.  I want to see beautiful
landscapes that extend to the horizon and I want lots of great music and
effects.  I want mobs whose polygons don't overlap incorrectly and who you
can't see through when you get close to them.

4) Stats should matter more.

5) I don't ever want to see another mammoth climb a tree or spontaneously
blink forty feet to the left!  Fix that Z-axis ignorance and teleportation
problem mobs have.

6) More customization.  Each class in EQ1 is very rigidly defined in terms
of what they can get and when they can get it.  Now, obviously, warrior
disciplines and wizard uber-nukes shouldn't be available to starting
characters, but I think the "threefold path" method that Diablo2 uses could
be a pretty neat way to do things.  You'd have a choice of lowbie skills,
each of which would lead up the tree to higher skills, and so on.  That
would lead to a world where some warriors are great at defense and taunting,
while others excel at simply beating the fuck out of mobs, magicians who
have huge pets but wimpy nukes and magicians who nuke well but have piddly
or nonexistent pets, and so on.  You shouldn't be able to just say, "Well,
he's a shaman, so he does A,B, and C, at skill level X,Y, and Z."

7) There should be mobs that run slower than I do.  Certainly, things like
griffons, lions, and giants should catch me.  But how can a decaying
skeleton -- mindless, barely animate, and so rickety that it clicks and
rattles when it walks -- outrun my sprint?  AC has a Run skill that helps
determine how fast you go, and pumping it up is a huge benefit.  I jumped
out of my chair and cheered the first time I outdistanced a banderling....
