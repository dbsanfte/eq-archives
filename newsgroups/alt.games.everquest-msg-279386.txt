This message is a lie.  It SHOULD read "x players are set up as buyers." or "x
buyers are online." It does no check to see if anything you have is on their
buy list.

Yup.

On many servers, there are so few buyers that you can just look at them all
(leave all search fields blank).

This could have been a nice feature and made it far easier for players to find
each other for mutually beneficial transactions.  However, it was badly
implemented and so nobody uses it.  My suspicion is that SoE designers
actively don't want an effective marketplace.

If they DID want to make the market work, the following things would help:

1) allow buying and selling while offline.
2) allow buying and selling from the same character at the same time.
3) make it easy to search buyers for things you have in your inventory. 
4) allow short sales on margin of 13-week bone chip futures.
