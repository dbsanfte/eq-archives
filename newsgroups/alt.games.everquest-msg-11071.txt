I still don't believe it.  In 51 levels, I have never been
attacked by an indifferent-con mob while invisible, UNLESS
my invis either ran out, or a sees-invis mob ran up and
took a swipe at me first (thus breaking the invis).

And unlike Dan Harmon, I *do* check my logs to double-check
what happened whenever I experience a "what the hell?" event.
I've never had an inexplicable "attacked while invis"
situation.
