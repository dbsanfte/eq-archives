Yeppers, that's me.  I'm usually so shocked when someone actually does that,
it takes me a few moments to even answer.  Then, mana permitting, I unload
every buff I have on them, if they are willing to wait, I'll med up first or
cannabilize.  It so rarely happens though, most of the times it's "sow plz",
many times it's something reasonably polite but while I am either fighting
or medding in a group.  A few times it has been demanded from me, which I
just ignore.
