If you use Google and are still interested, you can get the old posts.

I was just talking about the need/suggestion to take it into the equation
when soloing and trying to come out ahead so it is a profitable experience
and not just something that loses you money, breaks even, or only makes you
a tiny bit.

If it is a XP group, then it is one that is mana-taxing on the cleric.  I
don't consider it a XP group is the cleric isn't sweating the pulls.  For
the cleric not to symbol up the key positions means that the cleric will be
wasting more mana on heals than he should be, puts the chanter at a far
greater risk of getting killed quickly before anything can be done to save
them, and slows the group down because of the mana drain on the cleric.

I'd agree, but things aren't always so black and white.  Loot division can
forgotten about it and many clerics (myself included) hate constantly
bringing up dot cost.  In pick-up groups, the rotating in and out of players
can add to the problem.  Etc.
