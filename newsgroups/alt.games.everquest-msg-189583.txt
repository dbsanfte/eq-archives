Its nice to find newbs who will accept advice. I started a druid on the new
Venril Sathir server and at the usual lvl went off to nro to get groups for
dervs and of course a lot of people there where as you say fresh off the cd
newbies who had been playing for 10-13 lvls and knew everything there was to
know about the game.
Good on you for helping them though :0)
