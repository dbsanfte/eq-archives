Read the earlier post, this scumbag EQ is posting under the name of Tanya
Worley (his daughter). Look at the headers from the Tanya Worley post this
morning, the part that says "X-Complaints-To: abuse@eqstuff.org" can't be
changed by anyone except "eqstuff.org". That's proof where it came from and
that's EQ doing the posting. He's posting as his own daughter, calling her all
type of vile names in order to get sympathy for himself.
He accused other people of doing the posting, then claims to be a big shot and
having the post cancelled, when he's actually canceling his own post.  Anyone
who even carries on a conversation with this pervert is talking to a serial
liar, and shouldn't believe a word out of his mouth.
