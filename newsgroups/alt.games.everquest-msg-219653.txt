I'm a card-carrying member of the UK's Cat Protection Society, and I can 
tell you as a matter of fact that you don't love cats more than we do, 
and believe me, they don't advocate neutering cats because of some sick 
titillation at cutting an animal's balls off.

I understand that what happened to your cat left you with bad feelings 
about the procedure, but you *already* are playing god when you remove 
an animal from their naturally dangerous environment. Once that is done, 
their reproduction needs to be limited to what the new environment (i.e., 
the family they're with) can support, and since *they* can't do it, it 
must be done for them.
