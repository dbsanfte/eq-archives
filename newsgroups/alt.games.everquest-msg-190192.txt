Since I no longer play the game I will share my secret for making GOOD money
if you are a Melee type.  Since you are level 33, the perfect place for you
to go is "The Gorge of King Xorbb".  Go to the center of the zone where the
Evil Eyes spawn, kill them and wait for a respawn of about 4-5 minutes.  It
is really safe.  I did it with a 30s warrior and never had any problems.
Sit near the wall so that the Minotaurs will not agro you.  At your level
you can spank them but if you are sitting too close when they walk by then
they will attack.  This is a nuisance.

The Evil Eyes drop many different gems.  Some of them sell for over 10pp a
pop to venders.   Every so often a Polished Bone Bracelet will drop that can
sell for 60-75 PP in the Bazaar.  At least that is what I was getting when I
was farming this spot.  In five hours of hunting here I made over 600pp.  A
solo Warrior that never needed a healing.

There are also some neat, mid-level magic items in the adjacent zone of
"Runnyeye Citadel".  This zone used to be one of the better zones to hunt in
since you have decent, lower level magic armor and some decent magical
swords.  Also there are a few lore items that are worthy of a mid 20s level
group going in and hunting.  Be very careful in this zone if you want to
hunt there.  Trains can be horrible in this zone.  If you ever get into a
fight that looks like it will be close then stand and fight.  If you run,
the train will definitely kill you.  Also, the funniest thing about this
zone is at the basement level there is a Goblin Banker that you can actually
do business with.
