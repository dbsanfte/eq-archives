    Monks gain FR as they level 50+, and Iksars have an inherent FR bonus (5 
points) and CR penalty (10 points). Some other classes gain other resists - 
the most dramatic is warriors with MR. A level 1 monk gets 8 FR bonus, and 
for every level from 50 on gain 1 FR.

    If you ever want to see what happens to various characters as they 
level, play with a made-up character on Magelo. By and large, their formulae 
are dead-on.
