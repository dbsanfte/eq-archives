Remember Questor?

That's always a good way into the game.  Enough money to get by easily, but
not too much where there isn't any challenge.

LOL, with friends like him.... <G>

LOL, I felt the same way a long time ago.  You poor country hick in the big
city.  But EC is the bazaar zone.  Later on, when you're trying to sell or
buy some neat items, EC is the place you want to be.

From lvl 16 on, everytime I passed Dorn, I'd kick his ass.  Dorn is probably
THE mob that pissed me off the most, due to trains and such.  Its a good
thing you passed your childhood in Misty Thicket, I've had times when I was
killing spiders and people would pull Dorn's entire camp to the zone line --
Jeez!

You're still feeling good about being able to help others.  But its the
A-holes that make people go anon.

<rant> I hate beggars!  If you say "no" then that's the end of that!  Just
because I spent weeks getting my uber-robe doesn't mean I've got the plat to
spare.  Go and spend a few weeks getting your own stuff!  Damn punks.

If you're lvl 17th.  You might want to explore heading over to Lavastorm.
Plenty of summoned stuff for you to dispell and they usually drop some
decent loot.  You even have a gypsy camp close by to sell stuff.

Good luck.
