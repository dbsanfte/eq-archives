I use Blueyonder (Telewest) cable broadband.
It is great about =A320 a month for unlimited 24*7 broadband connection.

But if you are not in their catchment area it is no good for you.
(The insatal costs will be high too if you don't already have cable tv /
phone)

I know people who play using BT Anytime, but that has the 2hr cut off.
They don't seem to have many problems with it, but do need to do a full
log out every 2 hrs.
They just use this time for their AFK rest breaks etc.

HTH.

Jim
