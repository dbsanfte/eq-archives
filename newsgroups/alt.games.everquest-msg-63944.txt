Unfortunately Lokari, I am affraid this has come to be due to many high
levels (*note to all reading this: not ALL high levels) probably pissed and
moaned because they wanted their level 10 Tailoring Mule to be able to port
to GD, etc, etc..   either that or just the large majority of people
actually complained, high level or not.. though, we all know MANY complaints
come through this newsgroup.  Either I missed it or no more than one person
has bitched about the tooth needed.

Sure, its convenient, though, I too agree that it was a symbol a sign, your
rite of passage... you walked there once, did what you needed to do and now
deserve the right to be ported there.  DAMN.  To think that Sunday night I
retrieved ANOTHER CS key that I had to destroy to do a poor tree huggers
translocate in a dire situation.  Sigh.

I would assume the soft cap. <shrug>  Tis very vague in presentation though
as you have said.

Nice.

Only like a thrid of the 3rd CD is used, if that.  I could just go into
Explorer, but, I'd rather just keep my game PC on standby incase the servers
go up or something, who knows. ;p  Replaces Antonica, Kunark, Velious and
adds the new zones.  Understandable I suppose.  Though, I did just about
have a car accident while opening the box with my right hand as I was
steering with my left... when I noticed the neat little CD "book" with three
CD's in it.

<grin!> I believe I would have to say there is enough ass scratchin going
on.  Nothing worse than not being indoors (no shrinkage for those wondering)
while I am sitting and medding/resting and see this ugly greenish/brown
troll scratching his/her ass.  Though, I do love their diaper appearance,
which I assume is probably gone now. <shrug>
