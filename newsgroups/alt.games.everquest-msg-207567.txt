Sorry while I agree they decided to go this route of aggro going with
zoning I very much doubt if it was anything other than a programming
issue they felt was acceptable and stuck with, choosing not to implement
any aggro retention methods because they realised that the zones suddenly
provided them, conveniently. 

Yes they chose to do it, but I think the choice was brought in by the
programming limits zones gave them. You list the Kunark ignoring moment as
prime evidence yet if we look below you say this...

And I would have to disagree because if you look at the kunark thing of
the monster losing aggro if you go back to the mob the flamin thing will
wake up and come a huntin' therefore your prime evidence for 'they
implemented the same setup with the larger Kunark zones falls over because
they havent - aggro is retained in Kunark - often its not a problem
because the big hunting grounds see the mobs killed or moveing away from
the returning players. I'd also add to this the fact they introduced
guards and so on in the Old World small zones to help alleviate aggro
issues.

Intended in the sense of they looked at it and chose not to do anything
with it becuase it worked, fitted the game and was fortuitously there,
fine, not that they designed it explicitly that way I feel. The zone
struture and motion around that structure would have come well before an
design of PC/NPC interactions....make your world - only then do you
populate it.
