Here, the places used (even besides churches, one of which is the community 
center, owned and operated by the city itself) must basically close during 
the elections.. they can't hold regular business at the polling location. 
The only exception to this that I've seen is a day care which, while in the 
same building, uses a completely separate entrance and is in essence shut 
off from the polling location.

Also, all political signs and advertising is restricted to be at least 100' 
from any polling location.  The attempt is to safe guard the voters from at 
the poll heavy handedness of the past.
