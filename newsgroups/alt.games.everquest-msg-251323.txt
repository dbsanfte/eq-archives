Yes, I do, in this context.

You're a pet class if you can cast a pet.

Saying "it isn't a pet because its not cast by a pet class, and it isn't 
a pet class because I wouldn't call THAT a pet" is a circular arguement.

You'll have to explain what it is about those classes pets that makes 
them "not pets" (thats an example of a loaded question, feel free to 
reword the idea so it doesn't force you to go somewhere you don't like)

But you're going to have a hard time selling me on it.

Because if it talks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a 
duck, its a good bet its a duck.

Noting that its a very crappy pet, its still a pet, you still spend mana 
to create a creature that works in every way like other pets.

I would accept arguements that familiars are not pets; they don't seem 
to share any pet characteristics other than putting a green line at the 
bottom under your red line.

Show me, though, a difference between the druid pet and the one shaman 
get at level 34.  Admittedly druids don't get theirs till much much 
higher level... but if the thing a shaman gets at 34 is a pet, then its 
still a pet at 56, just a much crappier one relative to the power of its 
caster.

Also, you seem to have accepted SK pets as pets; again, you have the 
exact same pet as a different class, only you get it at a higher level. 
  The difference between the SK pet and the druid pet is merely one of 
degree, not of kind.

The cleric and wizard pet are more interesting to argue about, because 
they have a great many more problems.

  One, they have low HP.  Well, apply my logic above; if the druid pet 
is still a pet even though it has a much lower hp than a same level 
shaman pet (one a shaman normally summons at 56, say), then having a 
much lower HP than a comperable pet isn't going to rule a pet out, and 
the difference between this  and the cleric pet is just one of degree.

Two, damage output.  Whoa, the damage output of the cleric pet is much 
higher than that of the druid pet.  Best leave this one alone.

Three, not commandable.  Well, the enchanter pet isn't commandable 
either but you didn't leave them out.  In fact the cleric pet is MORE 
commandable than the chanter pet, in that he'll attack a designated 
target without the caster having to get attacked.

Four, won't defend their master.  Hmm, yes, they do, just as any other 
pet will, if their master is attacked by a mob, when they finish with 
their current mob they will turn and attack the new target.

Five, suicidal.  This is different behavior... but not radically 
different from other pets, who will suicide if their master goes invis 
(even if they have see invis) or zones or crashes to desktop.  Its 
certainly annoying, but I think any attempt to use this sole feature as 
a way of drawing a line between pet and not is pretty thin.

Compare a DOT to pets instead.  Well, DOTs can be resisted, pets can't, 
not even the hammer.  DOTs do a predictable amount of damage each tic 
(the focus item changes this), while pets do melee damage that varies 
pretty wildly, even the hammer.  SOW'd mobs can't outrun a DOT, but they 
can outrun unSOWed pets, even the hammer.  Buffed up with SOW, pets can 
keep up with SOW'd mobs, even the hammer.  Buff up a pet and he'll do 
more damage or have more HP or better resists or, whatever the buff was; 
this works on all pets, even the hammer, but not on any DOT.  DOT's can 
be removed with a dispell or cure, not so pets, not even the hammer. 
DOT's don't care what position the target is in, pets do more damage 
from behind than in front, even the hammer

The list goes on and on, but to me its pretty clear, DOT =/= pet, not 
even hammer.
