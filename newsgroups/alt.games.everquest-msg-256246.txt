Rogues outdamage rangers who ARE trueshotting, on all mobs.  On these boss
mobs the ranger is likely to be trueshotting, your overall raid DPS should
be higher.

Yes, rogues do far more dps, but the monks were still out dpsing rangers yes
(not sure this is relevant to this thread much).

Yes, but how much aggro do you need in an exp group situation? Enough to
keep aggro off the cleric / debuffer, irrelevant for raiding, unless, as you
said below the content is gimp to you (which again makes it irrelevant imo).

And a ranger wasnt? :P

You do know rangers actually lower their dps through casting?

Hmm not sure, dont have sylvan light, you have mend which I would guess
heals more and may actually be useful, a rangers heal is rarely if ever
'needed' If it is you are probably going to die anyway.

I agree they are nice, but other classes have it who are in a much better
situation to make use of them.

They are great in tier 3 and under exp groups though (though again not
unique and you can live without them).

Yes, this can happen of course, but rarely enough to make in not that much
of an issue.

FD can fail, but is never resisted, and now with the new GoD AA, even spell
casters pose little threat to a monks FD pull.  And if you screw up the
pull, you will live where a ranger dies.

Wasnt aware it was capped at 65, new it was unresistable though. (new OoW
bard lull looks to have  a 73 cap, just FYI).

If they have the spare buff slots.  And it isnt like the raid will wipe
without them, would people even notice if they didnt have them? I doubt it.

Actually meant SK, warriors outdamage a ranger pure melee, with equal
attack, which is rare to happen I guess.

Sk can also snare, and can also FD.

Dont get me wrong, I guess I am at the high point in my career, BoT / HoH /
Plane of Tactics, I am probably one of the highest DPS in my guild right
now, but I will stay almost static where others will pull ahead.

I do love the class, I have played nearly everyone, and none have been as
much FUN as my ranger, I love to prove people wrong where I can.  It may
seem like complaining, but really, as long as I have fun I dont care that
much, but that does not mean I cannot see problems with the class.

Oh yer, and nerf beastlords :PP
