That's the technique I read about on several different boards.

The technique I use is to move to barely within spellcasting range and
target a bloodgill. Then I turn around and face the direction I want
to go and cast flame lick on the bloodgill. I swim like crazy towards
the next pair, aggro them and swim to the surface to get a bit of
distance on the bloodgills. Then I pop back into the water and swim to
shore. My swimming is 200 so I'm pretty fast in the water.

The hard part about that is aggroing the second pair. So far I've
always gotten too close and had them smack me a couple of times before
I got away. If they stun you in the water you're in a world of hurt.

The real challenge lies on the shore. My usual technique calls for me
running far enough away to cast ensnare before they hit me. Problem
is, if you get too far away from the bloodgills they head back into
the water. So you gotta stick close to the ensnared ones, which means
the unensnared ones might get close enough to hit you.

Ensnaring them in the water means a LOOOOOONG pull to shore, a risk of
aggroing wandering barracuda, and a very real possibility of losing
one or more as you're pulling.

Good luck! I found bloodgills great xp. Quadding them got me out of
hell 45. With any luck they'll get me to 49 asap (Lightning Blast,
Skin Like Nature, Starfire, Shield of Thorns... can't wait!)
