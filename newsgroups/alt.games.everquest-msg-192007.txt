I'm curious: Was the resolution on most of the preceeding screens also
screwed up a bit?

For instance, were the asterisks used to represnt your password blurry? Or
was I the only one having that problem.

I also couldn't access the McAfee Firewall notification to allow the patched
.exe file to access the net, and had the password screen lockup after I
rebooted and tried again with the Firewall disabled. Never had trouble
giving Firewall the okay at the log-in screen before......
