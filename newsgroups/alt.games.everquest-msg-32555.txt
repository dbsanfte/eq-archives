Be careful not to do this with No Drop items.  They will go into the
stationary container just like normal items, but will disappear forever once
you close it.

You cannot transfer containers (like tailor made backpacks) this way,
either.  Containers will not go into other containers.

Also, try to watch /who is in the zone when you try such a transfer.  Now
that the word is out about this exchange method, there are sure to be some
beggar types who will be running around city zones checking all the forges
and brew barrels looking to steal stuff other people are trying to transfer.
