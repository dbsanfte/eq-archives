I have a hard time imagining that people will wilingly automatically give up
their current weapon in order to get an upgrade. Weapons don't always work
like this, sometimes you want different weapons for different purposes.
Moreover, some are class-specific or NODROP and will not be easily
transferable, etc. And can you imagine the discussions that will take place
regarding what is "better" and what actually constitutes an upgrade: "I
don't want his hand-me-down, I like my current better", and so on.

No offense (and I note the disclaimer), but making suggestions for a
fundamental game mechanic for a game that you have never even played seems
very unlikely to yield useful results. You're just missing way too much
context.
