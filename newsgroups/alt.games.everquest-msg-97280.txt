Interesting note:  My Beastlord at 28, paired up with a guildies 20
monk and went into Marus Seru a couple nights ago.  Neither of us
exactly known for AC, but we MOWED 'em down.  My Beastlord (barbarian)
pretty much had aggro every fight, but they were dropping so fast it
hardly mattered.  Stuff was blue/white to me, red to him.  

I really gotta get my hand-to-hand skill up...  while I had a Polished
Steel Ulak in my offhand (skill is now up to 54) dang monk was
out-damaging me.
