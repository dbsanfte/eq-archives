Actually, you're a moron for trying to carry on a real-time
conversation in a newsgroup without reading a few posts first. Kind of
like coming in on the tail end of a conversation and interrupting with
your own question without considering that they may be already
discussing your very issue.

Additionally, if you think you can get your answers from A.G.E., as
well you should, you should also consider that your questions may have
already been asked and answered - sometimes an exhaustive number of
times. We have no tolerance for the search-phobic.
