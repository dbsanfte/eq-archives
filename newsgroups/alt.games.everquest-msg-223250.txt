I got the OOT one twice:

Once in 40 minutes of being bored, with no one else in the zone (I was
bored so ran around killing oracle and stuff and the PH, AC spawned.)

Once I got it in 2 seconds, logging on after the server went up.
Again, no one was in the zone. After I got it two casters were there
when i ran back around. They said, "sorry, camped." I did not have the
heart to say, sorry, you missed the one that was up all by itself
within a span of minutes."

I got the SRO one once, after 50 minutes with no one on. I followed
the "kill all spiders, kill all pumas, kill all special nameds, ignore
tower and dumb crap like time of day" spawn method.

I also sat IN oot for a couple hours here and there, getting xp and
jewels while no AC spawned. So really, the AC can spawn anywhere from
nil seconds (already up) to never. Its a random roll at EACH spawn PH,
so 20 minutes or 6 hours are the same. Either way it is just luck. So
I always tryed for a bit then gave up for that day.
