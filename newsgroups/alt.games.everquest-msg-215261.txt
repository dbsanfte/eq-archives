I've only had to do minor upgrades to my system, and it still plays EQ 
without any problems.  Still have a PIII, using 133MHz SIMMs.  I have put 
a grand total of $450 into my computer to upgrade it to where it is now.  
I have had the computer for several years now, and expect to have it for 
a few more.  It is the 3rd PC I have owned ever.  You really do not need 
to replace your computer with a new one all that often, a few upgrades 
will keep it going for a good long time generally.
