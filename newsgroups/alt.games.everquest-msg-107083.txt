Now, I'm not an expert on Rogues, but I do believe that you have to have a
piercer in your primary hand to be able to backstab, a great Rogue offence
skill. Keep the piercer in your main hand.

Off hand, now there's a question. There are many different theories on what
kind of weapon to use in Off hand, fast or heavy-hitting. Just decide which
you want to follow. I like to use a hard-hitting weapon in my Off hand.

> I have zero 1hb and hth skill. Problem?

You may perhaps want to do something about your 1hb skill. Hand to hand is
nearly useless except perhaps on corpseruns when you have no weapons. Good
luck!
