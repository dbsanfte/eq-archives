As with many other things, YMMV. I never even had any EQ friends on
the same continent, or even regular friends I grouped with ingame. 
And I am fairly certain that while these lost friends don't feel close
enough to me to contact me on their own, I am equally certain that
they'd talk with me as if I hadn't been gone at all should I ever
start playing again. And that's fine with me.
