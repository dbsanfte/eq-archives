As far as I know, wisdom has no affect on mana regen rate.  No effect,
either, if I got affect/effect mixed up again. :-)  Has this changed?

Your wisdom affects your max mana.  When your wisdom is 79, your mana bar
will be full at 872 mana.  (I'm assuming no +mana items).  At 92 wisdom,
your mana bar is full at 1000 mana.

If you swap in wis gear, med to full, then stand up and swap in the lower
wis gear, you'll just drop instantly to 872 mana from 1000, throwing away
128 mana, and the ~40 seconds it took to meditate from 872 to 1000.
