Sigh. It's happened to me every night since the last patch.  I'm on a
very fast cable modem link (1.8 Mbps), and I'm not showing any
significant lag to the connection.  I've even changed my DNS away from
the default ones I get from ISP to a couple of open-source registries,
which has improved performance.  Still, I get desktop crashes in the
bazaar.
