    Clerics have many of the same tools available as a paladin in pulling,
and do it much the same way. For singles with no chance of respawn along the
way, Stun the target to gain some running room and haul back. For a pair,
either root one and let the other come with you, warning the group when the
second is inc., or use stun to gain some room on one. The stun split is most
used when respawn is likely, and waiting for root to break could mean
adds/train. On up to two, you even have the AC to stop a fair distance from
the party to allow some form of parking before bringing it all the way in.
For multiples, well, you can always DA pull. ;-)

    The one time I was allowed to pull in Karnor's, after both tanks had
left and before we could find anyone, I went and got the group a Jarsath
Trident so I can't be that bad! (/em touches her lucky clover behind her
back.)
