Oh, no. =) I ment that I need to cast one of those heal spells that my
group members are so wild about. The ones that save them when they are
about to be killed by that over pull. Casting spells all over the
place, then LOM, no mana to cast any more heal spells.

Happened last night, just after a LD, I came back to find the group
tank down to 5% health. I was LOM and couldn't cast my heal spell. So
I tried and failed. then canni to try and get some mana back to see if
I could cast it. If I were to cani twice in a row I probably could
have cast it, but he may not have survived. However, I canni once to
see if that would give me enough mana, and it didn't, so I canni
again. Still no... Annoying.
