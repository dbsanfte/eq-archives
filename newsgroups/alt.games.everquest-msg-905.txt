In the Cultural Forge I believe you get the message "The forge doesn't
accept that..." or something like that, then everything disappears, but if
you close and reopen the forge it's all still in there. The Dark elf
Cultural Forge is in 3rd gate, and I don't believe there is a regular forge
in that zone. There's one in the Commons, and 2 in the foreign quarter.
