You do know that you can contact Verant with complaints about the GMs, 
right?  It's not going to be an easy fix, but if you document the 
incidents that lead to your complaints, and you complain in a coherant, 
respectful, and dispassionate manner you will most likely get some level 
of satisfaction.  Verant does stand behind their GMs to a certain extent, 
but they are learning that slapping a leadGM tag on someone doesn't 
immediately make them wise and all-knowing.

Hell, I still have good interactions with every GM I've dealt with, and 
was laughing madly when a server GM threw our original uberguild and our 
server zerg guild out of ToV for being idiots.  (Same zergs last night 
pulled Klandicar over us, after we had him down to a sliver with 21 and he 
gated, they had 60 freaking people in the zone and were wiped out, heh.)
