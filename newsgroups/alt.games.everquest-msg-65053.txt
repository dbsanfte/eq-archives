256MB DDR memory is NOT the same as 512MB of SDR memory.  You have
theortically twice the memory bandwidth (memory access on both rising
and falling clock pulses) but you don't get additional storage.

And remember, higher bandwidth doesn't mean better overall
performance.  DDRs have higher latency then SDRs.  That latency can
affect overall performance.

A stationwagon filled with floppies has a pretty impressive bandwidth.
But the latency can kill you.
