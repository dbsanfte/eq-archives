Jboots (and SOW for that matter) are not applicable while indoors... you can
get the effect by stepping outside to refresh, of course, but there are times
when
this isn't practical.  Run works -all- the time.

That said, in your case regen or first aid may be more usefull... instead of
running
away you can try FD, while regen/bandaging equates to mana flow for you.
