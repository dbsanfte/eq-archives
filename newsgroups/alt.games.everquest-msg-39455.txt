Where can i find documented proof of the over 100 stam thing? I don't
believe that if the yellow bar is at 0, it doesn't affect your fighting
ability. I tested it with 2 jade maces and no haste. I swung consistently
until the bar reached 0. Then my swings decreased to half of what i was
swinging at full or half.
