For a long, long time I used to like to buy lowbie rogues a parrying dagger
and a copule of basic items.  My first bard would consistently buy a new
bard his first 2-3 songs (it's next to impossible to earn the $ for those
songs until you're 2-3 level).

Lately, almost every single lowbie I look to hand an item down to
(especially rogues!) is just a twink.  I've not had as much problems with
beggers for a while.  If there's someone shouting in-zone, I'll drop a plat
or two on the ground and shout so that beggar-boy has a tiny chance at
getting it but the non-beggars will have a better chance :)
