I dunno. I couldn't do that to a newbie, but I figure anyone who's
been around long enough to make 800 plat really should be able to look
after themselves. He offered the money.... it's not like you asked for
it. If he doesn't know the real worth of the weapon, well.... he
should've taken the time to look it up, like the rest of us. Hell, how
much effort is it to do an /ooc PC please? Serves him right for buying
his character on ebay ;)
