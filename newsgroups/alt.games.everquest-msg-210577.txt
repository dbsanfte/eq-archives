Well its a bit confusing, having 2 different servers and 2 totally different
approaches for experience now.
1 was minimal cleric numbers (with several bots), the other is a high number
of unbotted clerics

As for RZ.... 40 was good enough numbers when you could kill corpses, and
prevent mobs from popping. That changed though, now it all spawns
regardless, so you just end up with a million mobs.

It's a pretty fucked up encounter now... it seems like it's been re-designed
as a zerg and burn RZ, just ignoring the incoming stampede and drop him
before they drop you.

Adam can probably give a better idea of numbers for a guild learning/first
defeating RZ (how many did u guys win with?) - my advice would be something
like 50 tho, which seems to work for you guys.

Most elemental encounters can be done with far less than RZ requires,
though.  Some can be dropped with as few as 25 people
