You and I were both doing really well on this question up to here.
Please don't "go Bizbee" on me now. I understand you are anti-guild, and
your reasons are valid. But you *have* been guilded. This statement
makes no sense. Even if there are "spur of the moment days", as I said
we already have, that means that "spur of the moment" opportunities that
come up are forbidden? Puleeease. You already know that having /gu
turned on is vital to maximize opportunities, as long as everyone
respects the rights of the rest to *not* come if they are otherwise
occupied productively (which any good guild would) or to come if they
like. And there *will* be times when some wipeout creates a disaster
where one of your really close friends in the guild is in dire trouble,
and if you had /gu off, you wouldn't have known about it, and wouldn't
have been able to "drop what you're doing" and go help. And you'd feel
like shit about it afterwards.

Why are you putting the word "expect" in there? How about "are willing
to know what's going on and have the *option* to go assist if it's
important to you?"

If Tangrin pops on a non-planned day, then there may *still* be a
sufficient number of people not doing much yet to go take him. Or not.
But if they've all got an isolationist attitude, then it *can't* happen.
See the difference? Saying no, or saying nothing in those cases is
perfectly fine. Not even knowing it was an option is pretty fucked up in
a tight guild.

Ah..... so now you're relying on "somebody else" to have /gu on so you'd
know about it. Ok. There you are. You're putting the burden on "somebody
else" to be doing the right thing and knowing about it, (and
subsequently wasting more time to then relay the message to you like
their personal servant) since you can't be bothered to listen? Sorry...
that makes no sense. Either the message is of possible importance to
you, or it isn't. Your example is a contradiction. "I don't need to have
that blather turned on. My buddy in my hunting group is my bitch. She
can listen to that blather and filter out the important stuff for me."

No... I dont' see it.
