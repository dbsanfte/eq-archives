Fundamental problem with that.  Not all posts will show up on a server
(they aren't guaranteed delivery) and they will often show up out of
order.  In addition, on a high volume server old posts become
unavailable very quickly.  In addition, since you posted, we have
to assume you meant to actually address something, so, unless your
typing this as some sort of mental masturbation, you need to provide
the context in which your post makes sense.  If a reader has to go
looking on google for that information he just won't bother, and you
have failed in your purpose of communicating ideas.

Another point - the top portion of your original post had nothing
to do with my point, so why the hell would I include it?  I really
don't care what newsreader you use - and I don't think it says
jack shit about you.  The bottom portion did, so I addressed it.
