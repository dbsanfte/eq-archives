I have found that when I right-click a fletching kit (I assume other kits 
operate in a similar manner) from my inventory, it opens up to the recipe 
search interface. If I right-click it from a bank slot, it opens up to the 
reduced normal containter view.

In either case, CTRL-left click usually does the trick.
