I saw someone selling that mask in EC but when I asked them for a
price (having never heard of it) they had no idea. I think if you are
going to sell something you should have a ballpark figure in mind.

As far as recharging, items can't be recharged ever except certain
specialty items made that way such as the gnome cultural armor you can
get new batteries for (and that old halfling ring which supposedly the
cleric lady would exchange with a new one, I never got that to work).
When the item is out of charges, you simply have to go camp a new one
if you want more charges. 

Ah I see now, its from the new chardok and off the bridge keeper.
Damn that would be a dang nice mask for my dark elf cleric twink (who
doesn't need the ultravision.. but just the mask ac/hp/mana)
