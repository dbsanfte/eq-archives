I for one have very low expectations on anything that microsoft put's
out, winblows is still not that great now is it, multitasking sucks
even in w2000 server on a P2 450 with 320mb ram, start a print job at
lowest priority and the systems is more or less unusable, my old P100
with 64mb ram has better multitasking using a non MS os.

I can't say that i realise what kind of patching need's to be done
that takes 7 or 9 or whatever hours, but when i get home from work and
is hoping to be able to play for a few hours and that is not possible
because of patching, that then is delayed and delayed again, that is
making me frustrated.
