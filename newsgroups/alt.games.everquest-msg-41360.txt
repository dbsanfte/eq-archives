Why, because you don't want to actually read what I

Didn't say it didn't.  Why are you trying to make it 
seem like the quotes I attributed to a few people on the 
radio, I actually attributed to you?

Would you like to point out where I laughed in my post?  
Because I've been wondering all day how I'm going to 
smile for 6 1/2 hours at work.  Especially when I know 
there is a whole table of pig-headed assholes who will 
probably decide this is a great joke and start in on a 
whole new category of racist jokes.  A laugh would help 
right now.

No, your reaction, in general, was not that.  Read 
again.  I pointed to certain statements I'd heard and 
how I didn't really like them.  I certainly didn't walk 
in here and say "Hey, guess what 
unfortunate@lotterywinners.net said?"

Oh no you don't.  Don't you dare miscontrue my words so 
far.  You think I didn't have friends down there?  You 
think I didn't cry most of the day while I was trying to 
get in touch with them and find out what happened?  My 
journal from yesterday is filled with pages and pages 
and PAGES of hatred against who did this, of frustration 
that I can't do anymore than give blood, and with horror 
over what it must have been like to die yesterday.  So 
don't you DARE step in and claim I'm some America-hating 
bitch.  Bloody hell, I've had a friend begging me to 
*move* to the US and live with her, and to be honest, 
the only thing that's stopping me is that I'd have to 
pay taxes to the US *and* Canada - unaffordable, to say 
the least.  But other than that, until yesterday, I 
would have much preferred to be there than here.

On a second note, I *hate* the PC movement.  I hate it.  
I will not be called Ms., nor will I be reffered to as a 
'wymyn' or whatever the hell they call it.  I will not 
beat drums and call for the downfall of every man on the 
planet, although I am also glad not to be one of the 
bastard rednecks around here who thinks making racist 
jokes all day is hilarious.

My comment was based SOLELY on the fact that it bothered 
me that people were making statements about the US 
saving the world, when many Americans (as certain people 
here have proved) haven't even bothered seeing that it's 
been happening for ages.

It's like sitting at home hearing breaking glass and 
laughter, but not getting out and crusading for more 
police action until a rock comes through your own living 
room window.  I'll still respect you for getting the 
police action in there, but if you start patting 
yourself on the back for 'saving the neighborhood', I'm 
going to have to ask you, if that was your aim, why 
didn't you start when the first window shattered?
