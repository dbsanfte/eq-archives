Hence my insistance that it is "legislation from the bench."  It's based not 
on what the law says, but on what another judge said the law says.  It's 
like inbreeding of knowledge.  Soon, the actual intent of the people who 
were actually and legally elected to make the laws is completely lost (as in 
these decisions).  -That- is not the job of judges.  Instead of shining a 
light apon the laws, they're casting a shadow.

Can you honestly say that Art IV, Section 1 can be interpreted the way the 
OSC did?  If you had read that passage and been asked if it gave the right 
to petition on private property, could you have honestly said it did?  I 
certainly can't.  Why would that change when an activist judge on the OSC 
decided that's what he wanted it to say?
