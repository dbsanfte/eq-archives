One caveat to the pet breaking mezz thing:

If your water, air, or fire pet is casting as the mezz hits, the spell will
complete and break mezz.  (Dirt pet root doesn't do damage).  I've seen pets
breaking mezz - quite frequently - but only on enchanter-charmed mobs, not
mage pets, and I consider that my fault.  :)
