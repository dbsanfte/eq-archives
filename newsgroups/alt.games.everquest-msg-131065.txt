I tend to make some nice plat from the crazed goblins in BBM and it is
seldom camped as the only good item they drop is for a pally only quest.
They normally drop a couple of pp in cash and three of the four items they
drop can be sold for 2 to 4pp each, and they almost always drop something.
The only drawback is it is a fairly slow spawn for more than a solo
character,  as a 34th shaman I can bully them around and still be at full
health and mana most of the time.  At 31 and 27 you should get some nice XP
from them as well and not have trouble single pulling them.
