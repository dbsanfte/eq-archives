Well, that some people will want to play both, that some people will 
want to play I and some people will want to play II.

That people won't almost universally abandon I in order to move to II, 
and that I will continue to get new customers.

I agree with your assesment of things and your conclusion, although I 
admit that as long as people continue to refuse to include which game 
they are referring to in their subject lines, its a bit annoying to have 
both games in the same forum
