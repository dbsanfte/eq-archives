  Yep, I'm very happy about this.  I'd still like to see the alignment
grouping restrictions remain, but it's true that people got around
them using exploits anyway, so perhaps it won't change things very
much aside from re-attracting some of the people who couldn't stomach
the difficulty in finding a group, but otherwise wanted to play on the
RP server.  Still, I think it would have been better if they
implemented the other rules first, to see if non-mandatory /roleplay
mode, the removal of the language barrier and the addition of zonewide
/shout channels alone might have resolved their concerns.

  Now I think they should make the following rule revisions:

  Add an /ooc channel.  They're adding /shout and /auction, they might
as well go all the way with it.  If they don't add an /ooc channel,
people will be more inclined to use /shout and /auction to use the
things they normally chatter away about on /ooc.  I want to keep the
/shout channel on because it's occassionally useful for things like
announcing trains or being warned of them.  The more conversation is
diverted to another channel that I can filter, the less OOC chat room
stuff I have to put up with.

  And remove the language barrier completley, which is basically what
this rule change does anyway.  In 20 minutes a level 1 character will
be able to learn Human to max skill, which means the language barrier
is gone for all intents and purposes, especially with the addition of
the chat channels which never were language specific to begin with. 
The language barrier just nerfs the custom animated emotes (like /wave
say shoos away some flies.)  It takes away one of the little roleplay
tools that was always one of my favorites on the old servers.

  Or even better, though it would take more work to implement, would
be to compromise on the language barrier.  Make it easier to learn
languages, but not as easy as before... increase the chances of
getting a skillup from listening to people talk in a language, and
reduce the skillup timer limit from 60 minutes to 5, 10 or 15.  This
way it would be possible to learn a language "naturally" instead of
having to power-teach them.  And also, make chat channels on FV
language specific.

  But I think I'll be able to live with the ruleset in its present
form, even if I might not enjoy it as much as it was in its previous
form.  I'm glad I didn't listen to everyone who said that Verant would
just ignore us and that petitioning, emailing, and using /feedback was
all just a waste of time.  Verant is a lot more customer conscious
than it once was, they WILL go back on their bad decisions if players
raise enough hell about it.
