You see? That's just it, there's always some reason behind all of these
substitutions and to try and rationalize some as "better" or "more
legitimate" than others seems to me a pointless exercise. My reality may
make "toon" completely acceptable in my gaming circles while people laugh at
me for using "mob". If I then switch to a different gaming context (say,
this forum) I may find myself offending a completely different set of folks
on different words. LOL screw that!

Over in the RPG forum they laugh at us here in AGE for using the term
"season" instead of "level" and they provide all the same kinds of arguments
about pretentiousness, "change for change's sake" and so on. Many coming
from that world would be bewildered at some of the conventions adopted here.

This is why I don't pay much attention to what terms people use, and I don't
laugh at them for using them. Why should I give a fuck, if I get what
they're saying and I like the content anyway? There's probably a reason for
their choice of words and if it's because they're moron d3wD 5P3@krs who
can't hold a complete thought in their heads, well, this is usually going to
be evident in their communications anyway, yes?
