I fully agree with stanmann and would add,

Depends on the group/raid makeup, RNG, luck, and your nerves.

When there's 15 mobs in camp at west wall, half of them aren't CC'd yet,
everyone's running half health and mana's getting tight, you need everyone
to push harder and stay on top of it, it's fantastic fun.

Seen an SK and Shaman do a Fear break-in, around level 67'ish, by having
the shaman bind outside, running in, slowing and tanking one or two mobs,
FD'ing the SK and gating the shaman out, and then repeating that to slowly
whittle them down, nice tactic.

Normal west wall break in with a single group of level 70's in reasonably
ok single-group style gear isn't too hard if your healer, tank and
enchanter work well together.
