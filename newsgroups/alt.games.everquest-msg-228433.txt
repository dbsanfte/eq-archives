We did some ldon raids a while back.. theres very little interest (of the
right classes) at present to make it happen though
Officers wont push for it as long as theres a 32 cap.. and its still up in
the air how our DKP system will work for Ldon.. so we don't even try to form
for it

I don't mind so much, in the offtime from raiding I've been firing up a few
more twinks!  Enc is 64, bard is 58.. my farm team is almost complete =p

Its benefit is neglible (its like 1 of those nasty rumours, you can't
prove.. but it seems to do *something*!)

Wow thats amazing !  What % was quarm when you got so low?
Our kills on him are very odd.. first ever kill was a flawless (after 2-3
wipes)
Next run he was dead on try 2 of 3
Next was like a win with 3/4 of the raid dead

The last kill was pretty uneventful for once.. but the spawn before that, we
wiped with 50ish.. had like 15 people log (left us with 3 clerics).. so roll
on the bot army.  Something silly like 34 mains, 5 botted clerics, 10 misc
bots, and we won!

Guess its as odd as the mob himself.. 32, 32, 302, 32, 3000, 3000, 3000
