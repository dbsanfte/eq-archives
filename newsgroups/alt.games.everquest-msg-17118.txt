Oh, and let me add, that first sentence should read "DE Necros are not KOS
to most things in East or West Freeport."  By "not KOS" I meant "the guards
won't attack you unless you piss them off."  If you try exploring every
square foot of East and West FP, you're bound to find some paladin or
something who would love to kill you, and if you do, you won't have much of
a chance to run away.  Sometimes those paladin-type NPCs will get trained
out of wherever they stand most of the time so even at the gates you're not
completely safe.  Don't try going in the casters guild in WFP, they will
kill you with one spell.  The monks and warriors may also kill you.
Basically con everything you see if you go exploring, but if you just go
directly between zones it's really unlikely that you'll get attacked.
