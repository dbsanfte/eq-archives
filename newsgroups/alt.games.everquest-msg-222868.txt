Creating a mountain so big that someone can't move it is by no means
inconceivable. Inconceivalbe is probably the wrong word for this
context anyway - i think you mean possible. I can conceive of
impossible things. If it was inconceivable we couldn't talk about it
because we couldn't conceive of it.

These are by definition impossible. Creating a large mountain is not
by definition impossible.

We know it's impossible. I'd stipulate there is no comparable proof
that says it is impossible to create a mountain so large that someone
can't move it.

This example works though. Making a burrito so hot that you can't eat
it is not impossible at all.

Right, but I didn't do that. Your examples did.

Except that then there is nothing special about that person (or entity
or ...).

By definition anybody can do anything that they can do (and therefore,
from their perspective, "can be done".). However, that doesn't make
them a god. And omnipotence was supposed to be a god-defining feature.
