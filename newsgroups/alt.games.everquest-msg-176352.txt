You should have quoted his second link to the manual regarding taunt, it
directly contradicts his position.  In particular, the second sentence.

14.2 Taunting
If you have the Taunt skill, you can use it to draw a creature's attention
away from whomever it's attacking. When you successfully taunt a monster, it
turns and starts attacking you instead. You'll find that taunting is an
indispensable group skill, especially if you want to keep the spell casters
in your group alive.

Taunt is a combat skill. To use this skill you will need to set up a button
for it on the Combat Skills tab of the Actions Window.

Once you've done that, all you need to do is click on a creature to target
it and press the Taunt button.
