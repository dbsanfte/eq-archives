At the age of six? Hell, my first experience with "stinky fingers" was
around twelve. I don't find many people above twelve any more humorous than
those at twelve and below.

Anyway, you guys can spend your Everquest sessions as name police, obsessing
about players names and petitioning until your fingers go numb. I'll
actually be playing the game, leveling and having a grand ol' time with my
EQ friends.

Good grief...
