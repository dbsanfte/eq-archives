*shrug* I didn't say the opportunities didn't have high "costs". You
chose not to pay them. (so did I) That's your fault. If you don't have
the time or will to put in the effort to get to the high-end stuff,
and you don't enjoy everything else, then you're playing the wrong
game. It's not that hard of a concept to grasp. If it's not fun,
leave. And if your friends won't have anything more to do with you
because you left EQ, they weren't such good friends to begin with.
