I use Servant of Marr 95% of the time and my parses match up pretty well
with those shown in the original post - generally 55 melee when attacking
from the front and 75 melee when attacking from the rear.  My results from
using Ward of Xegony also correlate - generally 55 from the front, 65 from
the rear.  Of course, the water pet procs his DD spell a lot more than the
air pet procs his DD stun and I think the water pet's proc causes more
damage.  I really wish SOE would give us the actual damage from the procs to
give us a better picture of how much more damage we're seeing from 50+ water
pets verus 50+ air pets.  All in all, I'm a bit disappointed by Servant from
a melee perspective.  The backstab gives him an advantage from the rear, but
I would have hoped it would just blow away the air pet's damage from the
rear and it doesn't.  It's also been written that the water pet gets an
extra attack from the front - kind of a "front stab".  This doesn't seem to
make much difference.  I guess you have to factor in the fact that the water
pet is spending more time casting and less time meleeing relative to the air
pet, but I'm still a bit disappointed.  The 50+ water pets blow chunks as
tanks.  When I'm using them, any concept of "off-tanking" is out the window.
Their damage should be vastly superior to the pets that can be used to
off-tank (thinking of LDoN in particular.  I don't think any of our pets are
going to off-tank well in PoP).   An increase in rear melee DPS for the
water pet would be welcome, but at what point would the rogues complain?
I'd also be curious to see how pet DPS stacks up DPoC to non-DPoC.
