Yeah I was pretty sure icewell did.. I'd imagine thurg does too, but as a
monk things like that don't matter to me :)

The best way for this working, for me, is to pull the corpse at max
distance, so your ahead of the mob, the corpse is behind him, and you summon
it on his blind side (behind him)

If you just run past him summoning every step and running, you get insta
agro the second you pass the giant.

Using a level 1 warrior (30hp or so) I've been able to pull a corpse from
the arena ramp to the bank without agroing and dieing (bank area is tougher
than arena it seems)
