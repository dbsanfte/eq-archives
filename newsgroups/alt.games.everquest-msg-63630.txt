  It's not that much effort, really.  It seems you can "force feed" yourself
about 2 days worth of food... that's over 2 hours.  It shouldn't be that
difficult to remember to eat something every 2 hours.  Just connect it with
some other activitly, like rebuffing.  Eat every time you rebuff.  Easy. :)
