Snippy

I have financed 3 POTC quest earrings, lots of twink gear and other
assorted things by mostly selling player sold NPC vendor items in the
bazaar.

The key items I sell are spiderling silk, spider silk, low/med/high
bear/wolf/cat skins and bone chips. While looking for such items I'll
come up with various other items which are mob drops and I know sell
for more in the bazaar than they are selling for on the NPC vendor.
With and hour or so of vendor shopping, I get at least 600 plat while
afk in the bazaar, sleeping in real life.

This might be a bit ghetto for you, but it does add up to good cash
eventually. You often get rare finds. Neriak is especially good for
many of the items I mentioned, my dark elf once got 95 spidering silk
off the first few vendors in neriak, at 3.5 silver each which she sold
in the bazaar for 3 plat each. I start out looking for one or two
things and soon have backpacks full of stuff silly people sold to NPCs
for pennies.
