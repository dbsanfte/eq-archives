It's more a case of "Since Verant is usually right, I'm inclined to
believe them over a group of people with an obvious motive to
exaggerate."

If you want to use a betting analogy, I'd have to point out that the
smart money will bet on the most likely to win.

I rather doubt that the number of times they've been wrong constitutes
a statistically valid sample, though. 

If you say "They've made mistakes", that's certainly a true statement,
but it's not particularly useful. If you want to draw conclusions from
it, you have to be able to say "They are wrong X percent of the time."

In my experience, the X in this case seems pretty damn small.
