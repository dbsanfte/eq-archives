Or maybe just maybe you could learn to play without a temp!

It can be done!

There is really no reason to be paying for buffs at your level,

Granted you've got a warrior... which is a terrible class to solo...and 
I'd suggest focussing your efforts on another character, especially 
through the holidays.
