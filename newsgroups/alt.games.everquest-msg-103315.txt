    Scream of Hate is a group spell. Everyone in your group gets 8 ATK, not
just the SHD. That's why it has a high cost.

> Siphon Strength gives you strength, which translates directly into ATK,

    ATK likely has multiple components, just as AC is made up of avoidance
and mitigation factors. Pure ATK buffs seem to raise damage output more than
a comparable ATK boost from raising STR. 8 ATK still sounds marginal - about
as good as getting three or four points in a given weapon's skill - but at
that level it's better than a hit in the belly with a wet fish.

    Which is another important point. You can stack these, helping you get
even more ATK.

    ATK debuffing a mob is as good as raising your own AC, although I don't
know what the ratio between the two is like. I'm guessing it's situational,
depending on the relation between the mob's ATK and your AC. Of more
importance is how angry mobs get at being debuffed, and what excellent taunt
this is.

    You're a tank, it's important that the mob stay on you. That means being
able to get it angry, with combat damage, debuffs, Taunt, positioning, all
the tricks you can muster. Don't discount this.

    Does this stack with all other AC buffs? If so, then again it's fairly
useful. Stuff that stacks always has a use, even if it's minor.
