Its still only once, and by the time I'm 65th with 100AA it will be dim 
memory, and not relevant to my game experience at all.

Fixxing the books so that you do a trivial quest or something, isn't a 
bad idea per se. I like it in fact, but as a solution that makes EQ into 
a bigger world it fails, imo.

Something like this would have a guide printed hours after 
implementation, it would involve running along zone lines seeing as 
little as possible. This is neither 'exploration' nor 'fun'. And once 
complete that would be the last you ever heard of it.

If they implemented it tomorrow, the following day 400,000 people would 
make 400,000 runs, and then it would be exactly the same world its 
always been the day after that, with 400,000 keyed/flagged accounts.

And then once that little flurry of activity is done, in the longer 
term, its not going impact the game experience in the slightest.
