    Wise. Resists are king at these events.

    Don't worry too much about losing WIS. You'll lose a little over 9 mana
per point of WIS you give up. To put that in perspective, you could lose
over 20 WIS before you'd lose one CHeal's worth of mana. Without resists,
you won't live to cast that last CHeal anyways.

    You haven't listed back slot. For back, I'd recommend either Kunzar
Cloak (2 WIS and 10 FR), or a Cloak of the Ry'Gorr Oracles (2 WIS 5 MANA 5
MR 10 CR). Both help you maintain WIS while getting resists up by a
non-trivial level.

>Face - Velium Ruby Veil wis8

    When you hit higher levels and WIS hits 200, look for an Enshrouded Veil
(AC 7 WIS 2 INT 2 HP 30 MANA 30 FR 10 weight point one). Very good
general-purpose face item.

>Head - Nightshade Wreath wis5

    For raids, consider possibly wearing a Skull Shaped Barbute for the 10
MR and 35 HPs.

>Ears - 2 x Forrest Loops wis3

    Electrum Blue Diamond earrings are one of the cheaper BD pieces to get,
and the plus mana helps offset lost WIS (15 MANA 4 MR 6 CR 6 FR).

>Fingers - 2 x Velium Jasper Rings wis7
>Primary - Dark Ember wis5 SF7

    For better protection on a Nag raid, also consider a Sceptre of Flame
from Sol A: MANA 15 FR 5 MR 5.

>Secondary - CGS wis9
>Legs - Gator Scale Leggings wis4
>Wrists - Cleric Quest Bracers wis5
>Chest - Cleric Quest BP

    Are you gnome or human? If you're a gnome, that old standby the Dwarven
Ringmail Tunic off Crush has nice resists (8 each CR, FR, MR).

>Arms - Ulthork Hide Arms wis3

    Hollowed Bone Bracers should be cheap for you to pick up. They have
MANA, and 7? MR.

>Shoulders - Adomantite Epaulets wis7
>Hands - Gauntlets of the Black wis3

    The cleric Temple of Sol Ro quest gauntlets have 5 CR on them.

>Feet - Cleric Quest Boots
>Neck - Chysoberl Talisman (sp) wis3

    For a raid, consider a Ry'Gorr Collar, with some MANA and 4 MR - and STA
for HPs.

>Range - Seal from Thurgadin Shawl quest wis3
>Waist - Girdle of the Diligent wis5

    So, looking at the short-term stuff I've listed, in a raid you'd lose 19
WIS on a Nag raid to pick up 30 MR and 25 FR (excluding cloak). For Vox,
you'd lose 20 WIS to gain 32 MR and 25 CR. That would be a strong start. As
you collect planar gear, you'll also get more resists (like the MR on EM
arms) that you can swap in.

>Also what items should I look to replace in general in an attempt to hit
200
>wis.

    Don't bother. Enchanters have WIS buffs - ask for them. Were I you, I'd
start planning more for how you'll shed excess WIS once you go over 200 with
various planar pieces, upgrades etc. Your AC looks fair for a WIS cleric -
Donal's Arms would address most of the deficiencies there. Resists and HPs
are lacking, though.
