You've already got a warrior and two paladins, though, the odds of 
needing a 4th plate tank are pretty small, especially considering that 
your -other- two classes are chanter (crowd control) and cleric (odds of 
serial tank death low)

Hugely, no, for that matter it wouldn't be hugely changed by dropping 
the 6th man entirely.  Warrior is about halfway between those two 
options; a real "dps" class might double the warrior's damage output, 
not having any 6th man at all would still only lose you one warrior's 
worth of damage.

I'm just saying that the only "unorthodox" thing about that group, 
considering that it was an undead rich environment where the paladins 
could be counted as DPS classes, was the second warrior.

Splendid
