LCDs are much easier on the eye, because they don't flicker.  When an LCD
pixel is on, it *stays* on.  However, there is the issue of response time.
That is how long it takes a pixel to change from off to on, or on to off.
LCD response time ranges from about 25ms to up to 60ms.

An LCD with a 60ms response time could never display more than 16 FPS, no
matter how fast your graphics card and CPU are.  An LCD with 25ms response
time can go up to 40 FPS.  The first would look bad on many games, the
second would be fine on many games.  I haven't checked this, but I'd expect
that at a given FPS, an LCD would look better, because of the lack of
flickering--but 16 FPS is going to suck no matter how flicker free it is.

I believe, but am not sure, that the response time usually given is the
average of the time to go from off to on, and the time to go from on to off.
If those two times a very different, there could also be some odd effects
when things move in a game.

So, what it comes down to, is you'll have to find a way to see for yourself,
and see if the generally lower FPS you can get with an LCD is high enough
for the games you play.
