I've been doing that with my summoner in EQ2. When I'm not questing or
XPing with the guild, I like farming mobs that I know will drop good
stuff. For example, I like killing certain double/single arrow non-KoS
group mobs. They drop pretty good and my summon can kill them on his
own, though he does require the occasional heal for the harder ones.

I've noticed that solo mobs drop crap. I can't remember ever getting a
decent drop from one of them. Seems like the best way to get rich in
EQ2 is to find a build that can solo group mobs. Since you're killing
them solo, you get to keep all the uber drops for yourself.
