That's got to be wrong, or limited somehow. (Note: Just speculating.
Never played on a red server.) There's just too many possibilities for
abuse if that's the case. I'd make it a point to always fight on steep
cliffs and such. If it started to look like I was going to lose the
fight and couldn't escape, at the last minute I'd just dash down the
slopes and let the falling damage kill me.
