I'm glad you are playing in a small room with 6 monitors so you
can see everyone elses mana bars.  I doubt most players are Quite
so aware of what Everyone has for mana, for focus items, for
buffs, for mana regen, for AAs, and for every possible
interaction of all of the above.  But you, you are a god among EQ
players.  Thats ok, because I eliminated all need for a rough
target to center on so I could duplicate it with my group; we are
using YOUR amazing ability to randomly make the "how are we
doing" decisions, only with exactly 50M more at all times.  You
got no target, no worries, group B won't have one either then.

You pull when its going to be enough if nothing goes wrong.  I
pull when its going to be enough if things do go wrong.  And the
only difference between the two over the run of an hour's time is
that you Start pulling a couple minutes sooner.  Thats IT.  It
makes no difference at all the entire rest of the hour, unless of
course we run into trouble, then you are SOL and I'm sitting
pretty. 

Oh, I thought of another difference.  I'm a bit less likely to
ever see that disaster, because everyone in my group got a minute
to run to the john, get a soda, stretch, whatever.  Your group
had to zone in right away right away right away, frittering away
any possible "ready" activities, which means they just a little
bit more likely to be distracted at a critical moment during the
actual run.

I"m not resigning myself to losing, I'm resigning YOU to losing. 
You see, you have 50M less mana in the pool.  So when something
goes wrong, you are less ready. The lower we go, the larger the
degree to which you are less ready.  Now all we have to do is
weigh what it costs to be ready against what we stand to lose,
and factor in the odds.

I am right, you don't have any arguement at all when they start
playing like you, BUT with 50M more in their pools.

You keep trying to evade this, but I'm doing my level best to
make you see that THIS is the issue at hand.  Not your uber pull
style.  Not your fantastic foreknowledge of what every healer is
capable of.  Not your total lack of fear.  Just the 50M
difference.  Pull at 30M and 80M, pull at "a constant difference
of 50M", its the same idea; isolate the 50M difference as the
only difference in the two groups, so we can discuss what?  I'll
give you a clue, its not how you have 3 level 65 clerics and quad
bot them.   STill haven't guessed?  Its the 50M difference!

This is precisely the point.  They play like you in every way but
ONE, the ONE we are discussing, the one in which I believe you
are wrong.  In order to keep you from wriggling around, I've
given them every single other ability both your players and your
characters have, including your own mysteriously superior method
of determining when to pull.

They DON'T try to stay at 80M and change the point at which they
pull, they pull at 80M if and only if you pull at 30M.  This was
my earlier effort to pin you down on the 50M difference between
the two pull points, but you were unable to take it as a given
even for the sake of discussion, so I've been accomodating.  I
think you'd be better off with the 30M/80M setup, where at least
you'd have 30M of room to manuever, but if you want to go with
20M, 10M, 0M... well I can accomodate, it just makes my point a
lot easier to see.

Yawn.  I'll discuss this some more in a moment.  But I will point
out here just for fun that you -do- seem, well the phrase I was
going to use is "deliberately obtuse".  Is that too generous? Do
you prefer stupid?

Much better than pulling at 80M, or much better than pulling at
50M less than the same points?  Because YOUR side of the
arguement is that if I pull at 70M, you pull at 20M, if I pull at
60M, you pull at 10M, if I pull at 50M, you pull at 0M.  

I'm not arguing that 50M is better than 80M, I'm arguing that its
better than 0M.  And I think you'll have a harder time proving
that than the earlier case that supposed we both pulled only at
30M and 80M, respectively... but you couldn't restrict YOUR
arguement to that case, so I cooperated with you and chained us
together at a 50M distance instead, but let you run free with
pulling slower or faster as you thought the situation required.

Understand yet?

Its not that its a brag, I don't deny that you can do it, hell,
you can solo LDoN for all I know.  But I don't think there's any
relevance to a tactical discussion to say "superman just walks up
to the bunker despite the machinegun fire", when most players,
and certainly all players to whom tactics of any sort are of
interest in this situation, are NOT invulnerable to 50mm chunks
of lead flying at supersonic velocities.

Ah, subtle difference.  You aren't right, you just now finally
understand what I'm saying; both groups do the same thing. 
Except for one thing, one Vital difference.  Group B has more
mana at all times, in fact, 50M more, which can be as little as
twice as much, or as much as 50 times as much.  The worse off
group A is, the more overwhelmingly Group B is better prepared.

When I thought your group was waiting for 30M, Group B was
waiting for 80M.  But once I figured out that you were being
"flexible", in order to make my point that group B's pace was the
same as yours only with a larger pool, I took them off the leash
and let them duplicate you exactly.

Wow, I think you finally get it.  Yes, Group B pulls EXACTLY when
you do.  At EXACTLY the same rate.  The only only only difference
is that they have literally 50M more in their pool when they do
so.

You've been trying desperately to make it so that your pace is
faster than their pace, so its better to be at 30M (or 40M, or
20M).  But this simple demonstration proves that its possible to
have 50M more and NOT have a different pace then yours.  

So since they have 50M more than you, and the same pace as you,
what does YOUR group have thats better?

Nothing?  

Thats what I've been saying the whole time.

Oh wait, they saved 5 minutes or less in the time before they
zoned in.

BUT they aren't as safe the entire time they are in there, and
when the chips are down and the timer is running out, they have 5
minutes Less time than group B, assuming it took 5 minutes to med
up that 50M (substitute however many minutes it really took to
med that 50M, but remember you have to do the same for both the
"How much time did we lose before zoning in" and the "how much
time did we lose inside" groups)

I really don't see how you can do anything but concede at this
point, now that you've stopped trying to wriggle out from under
it.
