Really? I guess the figures I had seen were kind of old (like the first
release of the p4) but I am certain I have heard similar things recently (I
use AMD btw,  as you say the Athlons give more bang for your buck) oh well,
I may go and look for some benchmarks to substantiate my claims, OTH, I may
not bother as I don't really care too much, I'd recommend AMD over Intel
anyway these days.
