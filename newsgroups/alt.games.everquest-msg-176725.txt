Do you judge books by their cover as well?

The "newbie gardens" are not the best place to fing RPing on any
server. Levels 1-10 are trivial to get through, and very little
interaction occurs between players.

The next thing you need to do is turn off SHOUT and AUCTION/OOC. The
people shouting "Ding" and other normal server nonsense are much
easier to ignore. They are also most likely not going to last very
long on the server.

Finally, the biggest thing to remember on FV is to be the first to RP.
Don't sit back wait for others to start, and then complain that no one
RPs on the server.
