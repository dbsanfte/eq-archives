}well, i finally got my tailoring skill up high enough that most bags are
}green and backpacks are yellow.  i find that i can sell a backpack for
}40-50pp, but the large bag does not sell at all.  what price should i ask
}for a tailored large bag on the FV server?  is it even possible to sell one?

I've had no problem selling the backpacks for 100pp on FV.  I wouldn't 
expect large bags to sell, too few slots, as another poster noted.  I'd 
have skilled up on something else... the large bags are a terrible waste 
of spiderling silks.  What is it, 6 silks per attempt?

By the way, you are hip to the trick of handing the backpacks to that 
barbarian lady to get tokens you can sell in trader mode, right?

}also, how much does a tailored quiver usually sell for?  i've seen some
}people ask as much as 50pp, but today i heard someone say that he could
}barely sell one for 10pp.  so are they easy to sell or not!?!

Sure, they're easy to sell.  The in-zone vendors give me about 1pp for 
them. :)
