Well, most rangers that get past 45 learn how to control aggro.  Hell,
even some bards do.  (I've been able to keep a full manabar on PoA
raids recently, woot!)  Oddly enough, several of our guild enchanters
have reverted to playing their first characters, rangers, because
rangers stack a lot better than enchanters on most big encounters.
