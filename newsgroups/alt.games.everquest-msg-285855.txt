Unless they made some major changes in level 71-75, the difference
between living and dead targets is about as important to the necro as
the difference in regular and summoned targets is for the mage.  Necro
is indead general DPS for nearly any target, regardless of whether it
is undead.

There are cases where dealing with the undead is advantageous but it
just doesn't matter most of the time.
