I would recommend waiting. It takes 1-2 years to play EQ. AO just came
out and DAOC is due in October. The smaller scale Legend of Mir
actually looks promising (open, free beta going on now) and there are
a dozen+ MMORPGs in development (though most won't make it)

I'm not saying EQ is a bad game, but these new games will be based on
newer technology and have hopefully learned from EQ's mistakes
(something that the makers of EQ don't seem to do.)

Of course you could also argue that EQ is more mature and proven, and
must have something going for it to last this long.

Basically EQ is about fighting in small groups. You either need to be
in a guild, have RL friends playing, or stick to a few popular areas
to consistently find people to group with.

The high level bosses require large groups and are usually only fought
by large guilds.

Certain classes can fight solo, but keep in mind the next expansion is
suppose to eliminate high level solo players from getting most
monster-dropped magic items.

There are a large variety of quests and trade skills; however, most xp
is gained through killing monsters (MOBS) and most items are purchased
from higher level players.

Zones are like maps. When you reach the edge of the zone (map), there
is a pause while the next zone (map) loads. Monsters (MOBS) can't
cross zone boundries so they can be used to escape a losing
battle--it's not as easy as it sounds however.

Pick whichever class you enjoy playing the most. I won't go into
details but it really doesn't matter. Unless you absolutely have to be
uber all the time, then pretty much warriors and clerics will always
be needed in every situation.

If you really think you are going to solo a lot, don't pick warrior,
rogue or cleric. If you have to be an uber solo-er, pick necro or
druid.

Probably BS.
