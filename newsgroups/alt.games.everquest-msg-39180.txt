First of all, thanks for doing all that research work, Dan. I think it's a
valuable addition to the general knowledge pool here.
  Second, a question:  Were the characters all actively swimming, or did you all
just jump into the water, sink under, and stand there? The reason I ask is, IRL,
you can obviously hold your breath longer if you are floating quietly and not
moving than if you are swimming like hell to get away from the bull shark. :-)
  I seriously doubt the code behind EQ's swimming functions is that complex, but
it would be interesting to see if the time to drown decreased while you are
fighting or swimming as opposed to just sitting on the bottom.
