Are sure you have the full version of EQ?  I think all you have is the
expansion and you need the core of EQ also.  Your account key for Kunark
would then be used to register the expansion after you have used the account
key for EQ to start it up.  You need a station.sony.com name and password to
start up too.   I had one already when I started EQ so I used that.  Also,
NEVER name your character the same as your station name, just looking for
trouble that way.
