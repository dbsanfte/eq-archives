So I have LDoN.  I bummed around my hometown, found a new weird guy, spoke
with him...blah..blah. Got my adventurer stone.  Headed to Butcherblock and
found 'the camp" near greater faydark. I'm a 54 druid, so I apparently need
to "find" my LDoN place somewhere in Mistmore.  There were 2-3 others there
my level, all confused as to what to do next...

Any help? Someone explain the whole deal for the various zones? Where are
all the "camps?"  Do they send you to different places? Who / what are raid
recruiters for?
And what are the (whatever they are called) "adventure vendors?"
