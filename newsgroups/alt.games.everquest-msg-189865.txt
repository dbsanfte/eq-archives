So based on this latest information: if I'm level 7, the level 6 mob is
1 level below me and giving more XP than the level 5 mob that is 2
levels below me, correct? 

And based on your previous statement: if I'm level 50, the level 49 mob
which is 1 level below me "won't give as much xp" as the level 35 mob
that's 15 below me, correct? 

Anybody else see something wrong here?
