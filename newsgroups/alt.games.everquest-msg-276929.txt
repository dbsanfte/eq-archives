Although somewhat out of date, Anezka's faction guide for Iksars
is still useful, if you can find it.  (I have a link to it on the
web archive site, but it's currently down so I can't verify it.)

Her guide doesn't cover the evil cities (though it does deal with
evil subgroups like Corrupt Qeynos Guards).  What I'd suggest, if
you're currently good with dark elves, is you go do the Red Wine
quest (give red wine to Lokar in NEriak 3rd Qtr) to max out that
faction, then go have a blast in CB.  (Hand in the belts to some
guy in Kaladim Warrior guild to really push up dwarf faction.)

My Iksar Monk is at least dubious to, and in many cases warmly or
even ally to many "good" cities, including Qeynos, Freeport,
Kaladim, and Rivervale.  I think I've done enough slaughtering in
the Warrens to be allowed into Erudin and Paineel, but haven't
tried it yet (not sure what factions I need to worry about after
I get past the guards).  Still need to make Felwithe and Kelethin
like me, after which I'll look at ways to raise my faction in evil
cities without hurting my good factions.

I admit it does help having an illusionist friend, but many of
the quests can be done unaided (e.g., using illusion potions).

I still find it disconcerting sometimes when I /con a mob.  The
last time I was in LFay I spotted the Pained Unicorn, and he was
"warmly" to me. :-)
