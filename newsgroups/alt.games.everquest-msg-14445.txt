I'd have to disagree with you on this point.  I've always liked a
system that thought it was better to let 1000 guily men go free,
rather than punish even one innocent.  That's the theory (and I say
again, theory) for the US justice system.  And I think it's a good
philosophy in most cases where some sort of punishment can be laid on
someone.

Agreed, Verant isn't the US Justice system, and there's nothing that
says they have to have a good justice philosophy, but I think it'd be
nice if they did.  They should truly and desperately want to avoid ANY
kind of punishment against anyone innocent of violating their EULA,
even if it means letting the occasional violater run loose.  After
all, if the violater goes free this time, in all liklihood they will
break the agreement again, and will eventually get caught red handed.
