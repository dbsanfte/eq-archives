Currently, I do a weird combo that is unique, I suppose. My necro is 24. I
park my pet in one spot (/pet guard here), and pull to it. I start with the
snare Darkness line, and run back to my pet. I pause every now and then, and
cast DoTs on it. Then when we reach my pet, I lifetap the mob to death. Yes,
sometimes it beats on me instead of the pet (heck, usually). But I've got
Defense and Dodge near max for my level as a result, and I think that will
help a lot at higher levels. And perhaps, this may not be a good idea for
yellows.

It works for me. I also have really nice gear for someone my level. (mostly
loam & a robe of the Oracle)

Grouping of course the strategy is different. When I group with a mellee, I
put up my heals. I snare, sic the pet, and alternate between healing my
partner, and lifetapping the mob. Leaving one of the Lich line up the whole
time, of course. Grouped with a healer pal, I just straight lifetap and DD,
because they will usually give me regen- which is better than crack for a
necro.
