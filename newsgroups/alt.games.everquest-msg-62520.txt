Not to my knowledge, but if you do the swim, you'll have more than enough
training to do it again.

My suggested route is to get off the Maiden's Voyage at the elf isle, swim
south to the Golra iceberg, then  southwest to the hidden inn, and then
finally straight west to the spires.

If you take the raft from oasis and head south, you pass by the raptor
isles, where you *DO NOT* want to be.
