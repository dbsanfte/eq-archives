So 42k damage per wizard for 12 minutes.  I play a monk, and am well
equipped but by no means the best equipped monk around (I specialize in
pulling, not damage).  My damage output on dragon fights, parsed, is about
3500 damage per minute.  Coincidentally, that comes out to 42k for 12
minutes.  I know rogues match my damage at least.  At best a wizard, after
getting to 60 and having epic/mannarobe or a supporting mana feeder, can
nearly match a rogue against those targets that DB will land on.
