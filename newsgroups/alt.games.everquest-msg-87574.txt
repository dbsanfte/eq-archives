Hey, the 0.083 for the schedules patch are bad enough, but those .055 
for the emergency downtime are totally uncalled for, ill go find a 
lawyer to sue Verant....whats 33% of .055, isnt 33% the standard fee?

Or even better, ill go invest a lot of time (and maybe money, didnt 
bothered to check the link) on a new untested game, because only VI will 
ever have downtime, every other game will run flawlessly all the time.
