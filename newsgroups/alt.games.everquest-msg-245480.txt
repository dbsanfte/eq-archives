Personally I think its pretty lame when people refuse to take a 
'rescue'... dropping a mission because you can't see a named at the zone 
in is just pathetic.

We agree there is a problem with spell drop frequency. I'm not debating 
that point. I have always felt that rare spell drops that force the 
majority of players to bazaar them when droppable or spend interminable 
days camping specific areas is stupid.

However, I don't agree that we should be aborting missions at zone-in 
repeatedly to get a drop. Instanced dungeons were invented to prevent 
competition for camps, to allow multiple groups simultaneous engagement 
of the same content, not to give the player base a way to 'force spawn 
named mobs' without risk & combat. Using instanced dungeons to 'spawn 
named' undermines the intent, and ultimately is an exploit. Not 
something one should be banned for... but one that I have no objection 
to them locking down.

That said, I still agree 100% that spell drops SHOULD BE INCREASED 
dramatically.
