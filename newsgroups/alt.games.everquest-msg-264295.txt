As long as levels are indicators of total numerical experience
what's the problem?   It wouldn't matter if a player earned the
required XP to level from 9 to 10 as a level 9 or a level 10.
IOW, killing that even con at level 9 gives the same XP as
killing that high blue con at level 10 -- and the player doesn't
have the benefit of additional spells/skills/whatever he gets
at level 10.
