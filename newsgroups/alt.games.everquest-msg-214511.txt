Subject: Lost corpse in Deepest Guk

Died late night inside a Deepest Guk dungeon and it was late and timer was
almost out so my group decided to call it an unsucessful adventure and move on.
 I just logged without even going after my corpse figuring I'd just get it the
next day.  I had been told that my corpse would just spawn right outside the
door we entered Deepest Guk through that's in Upper Guk but when I got there
there was no corpse to be found.  I'm a risk taker and have been known to
suffer a stupid death or two so I've got my /corpse hotkeyed and I was running
around hitting and my corpse was nowhere to be found.  After waiting for a long
while I was finally able to get a bard from my guild come help me find
it.(yeah, necro woulda been easier but weren't any available).  Anyway, I
finally found the corpse but it wasn't anywhere near the entrance to Deepest
Guk, it was under water under the three way bridge you have to go over.  I
didn't consent anyone so I don't understand how it got there.  One of my group
members said he was gonna drag our corpses to entrance but I never gave him
consent.  Instead I just logged thinking it wasn't going to be any trouble to
get the corpse anyway.  Is it possible he dragged it anyway and dropped it on
the way or something?  Dunno here, moral to the story might be to go ahead and
do your CR right away in LDoN until it's been all worked out or you might need
help finding it.  Good Luck.
