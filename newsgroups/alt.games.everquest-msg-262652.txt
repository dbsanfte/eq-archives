Hi ...

    Well, I decided to start a new Bst and do the tutorial for the stuff. I
transferred everything over from my other toon, except the no drop
stuff...so she's pretty set except for having to do the questing again
*sigh*

   And I still can't get Gnoll Fangs from the pups in Everfrost...I'm
starting to think they changed the drop from the pups to only spawn on the
Gnolls in BB. Has anyone gotten them in the last few days?

   I'm on Maelin Starpyre if anyone wants to give me a hollar.

               Thanks;
                   Sherri
