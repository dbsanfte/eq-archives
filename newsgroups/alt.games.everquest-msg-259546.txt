well i understand all this, but like i said, i just figured he was headed
off to fight tribals and got delayed when a shroom started attacking him.
the wolf was behind him and i didn't think he noticed it, so what's the harm
in saving him some trouble?  (i don't have any heals or buffs, at least not
good ones) then if it ended up that i was KSing, just say "sorry for KSing"
and people usually say "that's ok" or "np" and then i'm on my merry way to
GE.  it was those damn shrooms that latched on to me while i was on my way
over to him that really messed the whole thing up.  not that i'm trying to
blame it on the shrooms, i mean, that is what they're there for.  looking
back on it, i probably should have targeted him to get his name and sent him
a tell, or just watched where i was going...

anyways, from now on i think i'll definately ask people before i try to
help, or if i'm in a bad mood i may just watch them die...
