Be sure you've trained atleast 1 point into each skill you wish to train.
Also you'll need to fight dark-blues or higher to get the to train in
combat.

IMHO you haven't made that much of serious error, you are atleast training
the skills now instead of at L30 or so. I made the effort to get my warrior
cross-trained in all the weapons he can (excluding HTH, that is still low
atm) because of the variety of weapons available. Unfortunatly I waited
until L35, so it took me a while to train them all, except the 1HS.
