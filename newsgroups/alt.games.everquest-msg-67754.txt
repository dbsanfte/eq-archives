brewing is always fun.. plus your bard should have good charisma, so if you
want to do one of the more expensive crafts with him and a cheaper one with
your necro, that would probably be best.. blacksmithing is entertaining if
you find a good place to do it, but I think what you should do it:
tailoring.  Mainly because you buy a tailoring kit and.. KILL!  hack/slash
spiders, bears, stuff like that... you don't have to put a lot of money into
it at low levels, and even at high levels it's not bad.  later on you will
be able to make 10 slot backpacks with 10 percent weight reduction, basic
armor, some not-so-basic armor, etc..

Good luck finding a trade skill.

PS-  my shm does alchemy, tailoring, brewing, blacksmithing, and probably
more, can't remember, and my chanter does brewing tailoring and
jewelcraft... just saying you don't need to limit to just one.. get a few
points into each of the skills and see which one you enjoy more.. the
brewing is fun cause you can drink your results.
