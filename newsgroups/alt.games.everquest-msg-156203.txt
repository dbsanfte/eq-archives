  I knew it was going to be a poorly researched farce
right from the get go, with the correspondent stating
that games like EQ didn't exist ten years ago.  Gee, I
guess my online multiplayer gaming (addiction?) beginning
on Compuserve back in 1988 was just a figment of my
imagination!

  I was hoping for even a sliver of objectivity in the
piece, but no dice -- that was about as subtle as an
assassination attempt.
