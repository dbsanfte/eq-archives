don't know about mana, but definitely time. if I don't have to go with
someone to get them where they need to go, then I don't need to take the
time to get back myself...especially if I'm in an area where I'm not bound
and have no plans to bind.

I can't speak for all wizards, but I'd be more willing to port someone if I
didn't actually have to go with them...
