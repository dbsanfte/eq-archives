Tried this some more today with some other druids.  Level seems to
matter, my original test druid was level 60, and we did fairly well
as a team, better than she'd done alone by more than twice the mobs
per hour (not to mention no dying and no zoning out)

Level 57 druid found more mobs that were "too high level to charm"
and had charm break a lot more.  Root duty for the target mob very
important, and cleric on stuns and druid healing more important than
before.  This was significantly harder.  Frequently we got low enough
on mana that it made sense for her to hide and we'd root/rot finish
off the mobs (epic DOTs) while medding back up.

Level 62 druid, on the other hand, had very very little trouble with
charm breaking, I was able to go pull in "next mob" while she was
fighting the first, no real worries about what would happen to her by
herself, I was mainly there to keep the pet Chealed.

The 62 druid had a 94 charisma, while the 57 druid had a 120
charisma, so that didn't seem to be a determining factor.  They were
all three using the same spell, Call of Karana, so that also wouldn't
be a factor.

It Could have been luck of the draw as to level of the blood raven,
but that didnt' seem to be a factor either, of the ones we charmed as
pets, all seemed to have either 10Khp or 12500 hp, and we didn't
notice one or the other holding charm better.

More testing is in order, of course, but it really looks like level
of druid most important factor for this.

Haven't tried it with a lower level cleric.  SR helps a lot for fast
healing druid, BOF for the druids spells casting faster... but the
only real concern I'd have would be stun resists on the uncharmed
pet.  If thats not a factor (say on the 62 druid who had very little
charm trouble) then you could go down as low as a 46 cleric and still
have pet CHeals...
