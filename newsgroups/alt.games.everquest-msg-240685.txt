Also... be aware that North Americans are largely clueless about how
this works...  and you routinely find references to time in 'PST'
during daylight savings observance, simply because while most people
do know they observe daylight savings, a vast number of people don't
know that the time is called PDT while they're observing it.

So basically if you see a reference to 21:00 PST don't automatically
assume GMT-8... if daylight savings is in effect there is  good odds
its supposed to be PDT, referring to GMT-7, and the author was just
clueless.
