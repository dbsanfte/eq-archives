Hi,

I finally started an alternate and chose an Iksar Necro.

I've been venturing a tiny bit out into LOIO (I'm level 6)
and killing the Sarnak Hatchlings, Goblins, and other
assorted blue baddies there.

Well, I'm wondering if there is some kind of "magic number"
of goblins I may have killed and now I'm *really* hated by
them.  Here's why...

I've been pretty much able to walk around and hunt various
things in this are for several hours.  Suddenly, I get 4
goblins (watchers, scouts, etc.) on me, I lose my pet and
have to run to the guards.  Hmmm... well, maybe I just was
unlucky and directly underneath a "group spawn" point.

So, I cast another pet, and head back out as I have done
many times before.  The second I come-up over the hill, I
get aggroed by another set of goblins!  Lose my pet and
run once again.

Now, I cast another pet, and very cautiously crest the hill
from a different angle.  There are no goblins within the
"normal" aggro range I've have until now.  Suddenly, 3 or
4 of them come running from much farther away than what
seems normal and gang-up on me again.  Guess what?  Pet
dies and I run again.

This is getting real old and causing me to not even be able
to run out and hunt anything at all.  These goblins are blue
and green to me, and like I've said, I've been killing them
just like anything else until tonight.

I was KoS to them to begin with, but did I possibly kill
enough of them to become "super KoS" or something wacky like
that?  Am I the brunt of a GM "event" where they're controlling
the goblins?  The change in behavior was just so abrupt and
has totally ruined my ability to fight in this area, so I want
to ask and find-out what I did wrong (and maybe, I'll have to
start over... :^(

Thanks,
Mike
