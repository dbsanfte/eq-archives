I own 2 accounts (well, 5, but 2 that started out as mine with zero
characters on them) and on those two accounts I have about 13 non-utility
characters on Zeb.  I know myself well enough to know that I'd better
goddamned NOT start another alt to ignore when I'm trying to hit level 56.
:p

Anyway, assuming BST can control their pet, the BST needs to sic the pet on
the critter first, then assist the pet.

You know, PLing a BST to see who can hit 60 first is really kinda dense, you
know?  I mean, it's one thing PLing an iksar monk/sk/necro...THOSE CLASSES
HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE.  NO ONE is an expert at playing BST yet.
