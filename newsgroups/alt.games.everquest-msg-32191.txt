Dunno about the drop rate, but I spent time in both and had more fun in
Najena...while waiting for your focus pieces, you can also pick up a dark
circlet, used to make crafted legs-should still make a decent profit from
them...

After spending 16-22 in Oasis, I couldn't get excited about killing
alligators anymore, and the gators in Cazic are quite a bit tougher...(and
running when things go bad is VERY challenging)
