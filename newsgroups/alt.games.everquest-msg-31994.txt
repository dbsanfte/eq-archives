This is it, I'm leaving Everquest for good this time...

What drove me to quit?
Well, killing mobs non stop for 3 hours and gain only a blue bubble and a
half of experience is just not fun for me and is way too much time
consuming. I feel as I'm just wasting my time when I'm grinding exp... Oh
well.

I will play one more time next week, in full screen mode, visiting all the
places I loved the most. As my barbarian shaman Halas, the everfrosts, lake
of ill omen, oasis etc... I will retire him at his original bind point right
in front of halas.

As my troll warrior, grobb wich is in my opinion the most wonderful city in
the game, the swamp wich is my favorite newbie zone, cazic thule, oasis
etc... I will also retire him to his original bind point right in innothule
swamp.

I will miss everquest that is for sure. I will miss the OLD everquest, not
the one in its current state. As old I'm talking pre-kunark and pre-level
51-60. When it was uber to be in full bronze and weilding a polished granite
tomahawk. When it was overcrowded in cazic thule. When getting a full set of
banded truly meant something... The good old days...

Farewell Everquest, I loved you much but now it is time to move on.
