Just wondering if anyone else is seeing this.  When I first start the
patcher, and the blue line goes across as it checks files, it hangs for a
while when it's at about 90%.  My hard drive is churning, and there's no
communication.  It eventually (after a couple minutes) completes, and then
everything works fine.

It started doing this when I bought PoP, but it wasn't so bad then.  I just
figured it was from checking the extra PoP files.  But then, after last
weeks patch, it started taking MUCH longer.  It's more annoying than ever to
get into the game now.

I defragged my hard drive and did a thorough file check (which did turn up a
couple files), but it didn't help.  Anyone else seeing this or know what I
can do?  Thanks!

-John
