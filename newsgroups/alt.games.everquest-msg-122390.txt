No...my head has the usual constituents of that of a rational human being.

or  4. discuss the rules with other players/game masters to try to get
unfair or outdated rules changed. (which I thought was part of this
discussion board)

Thanks for your reasoned insight Biz. Why not maybe suggest what a real
naming policy should be, in order to prevent more infractions in your
precious rules, instead of just saying "If you dont like it, fuck
off...YAH!"
If the rules, i.e. The naming policy, are unclear, maybe its time for
something to be done about it. I have no problem playing by the rules, but
when the rules are changed on a whim, then I get annoyed.
