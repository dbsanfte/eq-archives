In order of preference (my preference)
Best Pullers: Monk, Shadowknight, Bard, Paladin, Ranger (outdoors)

While a Shadowknight is a better puller than a ranger, I would pick a 
ranger over a Shadowknight for a group if there already was a tank (for 
the extra damage). Monk is the ideal puller (best pulling skills and 
good damage too when fighting)

Best Tanks: Warrior (best defense and HP), Paladin/Shadowknight (Best 
agro control)

In a nuker-heavy group, I would go for Paladin/Shadowknight as Tank, 
(you dont want those guys in dresses that hang around in the back 
getting hit as soon as they zap the mob).
