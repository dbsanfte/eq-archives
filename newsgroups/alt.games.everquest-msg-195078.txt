Just a couple of quick questions about this dragon in CS.
My brother's warrior is in need of a new haste item and
everywhere I read says this guy is fairly easy.

Where abouts does he spawn?  Can he be tracked from the
druid ring or would I have to run over the water?

What is his spawn timer after kill and on server reset?

I read that he is slowable....is this correct?

Would the possibility of my brother (63 warrior weilding
a Swiftblade of Zek and an Umbral weapon) and me
(63 shaman with all 61/62 spells and most 63) be able
to duo this guy?  (We work really well together and can
accomplish quite a bit alone) I read that some people have
done him with as few as 2 people but not sure if they are
talking out their ass or not.  We can kill things like
Lodizal, Gaurdian Wurms(skyfire), can hold Kael arena
alone and various PoP stuff alone with no trouble, so if
we get fully raid buffed before attempting, what would be
our chances?  Oh, and what kind of resists are needed?
I've read cold and magic, does that sound right?

Thanks for any info in advance
