You are better off buying an all in one package, or as many in one package
as possible, monetarily speaking. You'll save money by not paying for each
expansion separately.

Your first EQ game, as long as it contains the original EverQuest, will
start your account. Anything else is an expansion pack... not an upgrade,
really- it adds to the world and what you can do. New places to hunt and new
features.

Each package comes with a CD key, which is need to either activate the
account, OR used to activate the expansion pack. The expansions are, in
order of release: Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, Shadows of Luclin, and
Planes of Power. Note: Planes of Power will be released later this month.

For each account, you get eight characters per server (generally), but you
can only play one character at a time. If you want to play more than one
character at a time, (simultaneously), you need a second account and a
second computer within easy reach. You can load the software on several
computers at once, but only have your account logged in at one machine at a
time. It is best to only start with one account. Find out if you like it
before investing in more.

> Can I buy a used game and use that?

If you buy EQ used from a shop, the account key has been probably used
already. This means it cannot be used to create an account, and you've
wasted your money. You need an account to log in and play.

If you buy from ebay or the equivalent, you are doing something that SONY
and Verant frown on- and if you are caught your account will be banned.
Also, odds are good you'll be ripped off. Caveat Emptor. Also, you'll have
no clue how to play someone else's characters, which is a very bad thing.

> What is the differance between Eq and Eq 2?

EQ2 has not yet been released, and will not until next Fall. Maybe. The
PlayStation2 version (EQ Online Adventures) will be released soemtime this
spring or summer.

> Also I have an ATI 128 all-in-wonder is that good enough?

Graphics card or processor? Obviously, I don't know enough. Read the
computer requirements on a Luclin expansion box and see if your computer is
good enough for those minimums. I have the suspicion you mean processor, and
if so, No, that's probably not good enough.
