Haven't seen one yet, to tell you the truth.  But since you can
mix and match about 8 choices for each of 6 facial features, you
ought to be able to pick something you like.

And truthfully, the new dwarf males are quite studly.  I'm
very happy.

There's a "Short and Stout Quarter" in Shadow Haven, full of
dwarves and halflings and gnomes (no, I'm not making that up),
I'll go cruising for female dwarf NPCs there tomorrow after
the patch and let you know how they look.
