*Snort* See how many tickets you get out of with that attitude, you
arrogant bastard.

Tip: They may be paid by your taxes, but they do NOT have to kiss your
ass. Guess what else? If you're breaking a law, no matter how minor,
then they ARE doing their job if they nail you for it.

You kinda dodged the point, though: If you were speeding (work with me
here), if you got pulled over, would you bitch at the cop for pulling
you over, or just suck it up, admit you were doing something wrong,
and take your ticket?
