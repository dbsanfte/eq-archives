Hi folks,

I havn't played in quite some time.  In fact, the last time I played was
just after Kunark came out.

I'm going to be having some time on my hands in a month or two and I'm
wondering if it's still going to be fun playing with just the base game and
Kunark?  I won't have access to the bazar for instance, can I still purchase
and sell items in the various zones available to me?

I won't be going out to buy any new expansions as I'll most likely only be
playing for a month or two, about 10 hours a week.  I just kinda miss the
fun of EQ.

Ben
