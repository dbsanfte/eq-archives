Well I just replied to the parent of this post, but let me chime in
here as well. I'm not sure why you would be using a definition of
human being that was either hundreds of years old, racially motivated,
or abused during a dictatorship. Unless otherwise stated, I'd expect
you (and I think you'd expect me) to use a definition from today.

I didn't say anything about how I felt about the issue. I just pointed
out that murder is a word with a very specific meaning. Until a
concensus can be reached in the scientific community about when a
fetus can be considered a human being, worthy of legal protection and
a string of other rights, that statement was simply factually
incorrect.

Did you at any point miss what I was saying? I mean did you really not
get what I was getting at or did you not want to? I know you're a
smart guy, your posts are usually well thought through. It was a
semantic argument, so what? There were strong and weak arguments in my
reply. If you disagree with it as a whole let's discuss it. If you
have nothing better to do than point out that there was one weak point
in my argument, and call me a twit, well.. I'd definitely expected
higher quality from you.
