DKP is easy, it works like money. As you raid you get paid, in DKP. In my
guild all bids are made in guild channel ( raid attendance is mandatory
after 6.30pm ).If no main wants it then its open to applicants and alts (
including boxed ). Boxed toons do not earn DKP.
 DKP is posted on a private forum, by class, on our guild website, everyone
knows what everyone has and its open. Logs are posted for each raid with
earned DKP on them. We only earn points for named mobs killed and not just
attendance.
 Bids generaly start off with someone throwing 1 DKP in, sometimes this is
enough, but when the EP armour pieces drop ( especialy plate ) they can go
for as much as 200 DKP. The bidding is frentic and the loot officer calls
the highest bid - example
 /gu Elemental Plate Vambraces Mold - Thugwarrior 150 DKP 10secs
 /gu Elemental Plate Vambraces Mold - Thugwarrior 150 DKP 5secs
/gu Gratz Thugwarrior

As an example the Fennin Ro script in PoFire will earn you 10 DKP and takes
2-3hrs.

Then guild channel is spammed with Gratz and Thug gets his item. This doesnt
take very long  ( 1-2mins )and we never have rows over loot. You work hard,
you get paid, your spend your DKP. If your class is listed you can bid, end
of story clean and simple.
