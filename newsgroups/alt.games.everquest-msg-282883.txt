What you describe is something that I've normally heard referred
to as "FFA", for "free-for-all" looting.  And I agree that the
casters can get left out of it, though if they're willing to give
up a few seconds of medding they can often get their share as well.

Ninja looting, to me, means sneaking in and looting someone else's
kill.  This can only happen after the loot timer has ticked down a
little, but that can easily happen if there's a big fight and people
are leaving the corpses to be looted after the last mob drops.  In
any case, I agree that the OP did nothing wrong, since the item was
advertised as rotting.  (Though as someone else noted, it may be that
another person had sent a tell to the advertiser saying they were on
their way.  So the OP might've tried doublechecking whether it was
claimed yet, and/or could've sent a tell himself to tell the slaying
player that he was interested in it.)

I'll see about adding FFA and ninja looting to the FAQ glossary and/or
in the Grouping 101 doc.
