That's an idea! Maybe I'll try that some time :-)

My point was that the frustration of having wasted your time, is in part
what makes the good days thrilling. To really enjoy success, one has to face
the chance of failure. At least I do. You seem to think that time spent on a
quest that you later find out you cannot (or will not) complete, is time
wasted. I think frustrations like that help me enjoy the quests that I do
succeed in even more. After all, there's not much adventuring in only taking
paths that you know lead to glory.

I'm sorry, I should have made it clear that I wasn't referring specifically
to you or your suggestion. I spoke more generally about all those
suggestions for "improvements" that pop up all the time, most of which
actually aim at making the game easier and more "walk in the park"-like.
Yours isn't one of the worst I've seen.

Unfortunately, SoE seem to listen to their customers and continue to adjust
the game in that direction.
