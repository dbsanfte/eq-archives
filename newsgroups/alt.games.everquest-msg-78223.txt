A guildmate just asked me for the link to download the weapon analyzer.
I checked out my old bookmark, at:
http://www.geocities.com/copelandeq/downloads/weaponanalyzer2.zip

and it looks like not only the download, but the whole directory is
gone. Did this move? Or just get deleted? Would be sad, as it's a great
tool, but a big set of files to attach and e-mail to your friends who
don't have it. Maybe I should just upload a copy to my website so people
can download it. Hrmmm...

Anyone actually heard from Copeland himself in a dog's age?
