}Well, as I recall it he said something to the effect that most people

Yuh, I wouldn't argue that the vast majority does this.  And I would avoid 
addressing the issue of whether or not that is a good thing.  But it does 
not seem like something I, personally, could honestly do.

}My biggest bitch isn't the being left out in
}the cold part, it's the use of descriptive terms like liberal and
}conservative as political labels.  I think of myself as a liberal
}person, but I don't see many allegedly "liberal" politicians whose

}who are quite conservative (in the most positive sense of the word)
}who have a similar view of so-called conservative politics.

Yup.  And hey, liberalism and conservativism, going by what the dictionary 
says they mean, are both good things.  Trying new things is good, and 
being careful not to mess up what you already have is good.  So, um, why 
have we set them up as polar opposites, with both camps calling the other 
one EEEEvil again?

It seems like people need a strong sense of "us", and this is 
greatly facilitated by having a "them" to point fingers at and throw 
sticks and rocks.

With luck, science will find a cure for that any day now. :)
