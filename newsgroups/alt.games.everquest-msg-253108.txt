I started a High Elf CLE because I wanted to do the new tut when starting a
new char.  I decided to do the Noobie armor quest and I have hit a snag.
Giant Sylvan Bat fur.  Does this ever drop?  I have everything I need to
finish it except 4 of these.  I tried Giant Bar fur, but that did not work.
I have been told I could buy the GSBF, but I have not seen any at the
venders or in the Bazaar.

Is there something I need to kill to get more GSBs to spawn?

Thanks in advanced for the help.

P.S. after I get this armor, can it be dyed to a better color?  Awful shade
of green and hard to find when looking for my corpse...he he he
