 Yes. Weapons such as Imbued Fighters Staff (38/40) are very good for
large encounters where you don't want to attract a lot of aggro. They
are also good for soloing mobs with damage shields. Bo Staff of
Trorsmang is nice as well (40/35) but drops in Veeshans Peak so a bit
harder to come by.

 Not to mention Verant just announced changes coming to 2 handed damage.
Will it apply to all 2 handers across the board? I can't say.
Regardless, monks should keep up h2h, 1hb and 2hb.
