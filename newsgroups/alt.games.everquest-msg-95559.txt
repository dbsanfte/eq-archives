Enchanters are in the unique position of being able to be bossy from level
16 on.  More on that in a minute.

Some suggestions:
- Make a macro:  "%t is SLEEPING (mezzed)...hit something else!"
- find out who the main tank is, and remind everyone to make an /assist
hotkey for that person.
- if you see someone break mezz more than once send that person a tell
asking them to always /assist the main tank.  Ask them if they need help
setting up a hotkey.

If all the above fail, make sure that you have root memmed (you should
anyway) threaten to withhold haste or breeze.   If this doesn't make an
impression, say "/g You guys aren't assisting...everything is awake...let me
know when you get your act together.  Until then I'll just sit here."

Don't resort to that last part until you've done the previous steps because,
quite frankly, "%t is mezzed" makes absolutely NO freaking sense to a
newbie...if they don't know what it means it's YOUR problem, not theirs.
