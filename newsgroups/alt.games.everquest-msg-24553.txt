Exactly, and, trust me, if you were putting the cash in to raise
tailoring to 200, and you were a monk, you'd have made your share of
black panther skin.

Wu's trivials at 158.  I have gotten 1 !!!!  Skillup after Wu's doing
Velious armor and its cost me close to 3k.  And I was lucky to get
that one skillup so quickly.

I still think the guys full of it =)
