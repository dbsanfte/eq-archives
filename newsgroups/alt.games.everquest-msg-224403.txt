In another "Breathe does something stupid" move, one night in some zone--Guk
or KC, something like that--my group near the zone kept getting trained.  I
was getting pretty steamed because NO one was announcing them.  I politely
asked in /ooc for people to announce their trains.  We got more.  I did it
again.  We got more.

After another, I shouted, /shout Would the jerks that keep training us
without saying anything please LEARN to play the GAME?  (or some such)

It was at that point that a group mate said, "Um, Breathe...  Did you ever
turn your public channels back on?"

...

I turned them back on, apologized to all, and crawled under the nearest
rock.
