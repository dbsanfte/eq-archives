I have a curious question. I am an agonostic human warrior. Everyone online
made a big deal about a dragoon, and they zoned, but i didnt. They found that
the dragoon wont attack me. They are confused by this and cant figure out why,
im curious too.

Why didnt the dragoon kill me? I mean is there any reason he didnt attack me?
