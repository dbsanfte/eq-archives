    I find that druids fall short during "oh crap" emergencies (this is
post-50 healing). Puller messes up, or snarer messes up, or the mob somehow
resists two stuns and lots of damage and Gates, and you get a wave of mobs
coming to camp. Druids make really bad fast healers - NI is too slow,
Chloroblast is too wimpy once you hit 60+. The druid is also a lot less
likely to be able to handle the hits from healing aggro in a situation like
that - they have to root and back off, or snare and run around like crazy.
The cleric is the one healing class most likely to keep the group alive long
enough for control to be established, especially in the 51-54 and 59+
ranges.

    Now, when you think about the great healers you've grouped with, why do
you call the best ones "great healers"? Is it because they sat there and
cast whatever flavour of CH they have for five hours without going insane?
Or is it because they saved you from a horrific train that you never thought
you'd survive? That, I think, is why groups prefer clerics over druids - the
memories that make you think class X is a better healer are shaped by events
which clerics are better-equipped to handle. Well, that and the odd
experience with dr00ds.

    That would be the thing that leads to the trains that makes them prefer
clerics. ;-)

    It's the exaggeration factor. "Aren't best at healing" becomes "can't
heal".

    Lots don't want to be main healer, either. Healing is relatively high
stress if you're pushing your limits, and games are supposed to be fun. I
know clerics that turn down Hard missions specifically because they want to
have fun during non-raid hours.
