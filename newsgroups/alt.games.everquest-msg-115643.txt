Yeah, you probably got lucky enough to run into the numbnuts that start a
druid to portwhore thinking they'll make a lot of money.  Most people who
play a druid as their main aren't such jackasses, but then again, most
people whose main is a druid have better things to do with their time than
be a portwhore for anybody.

I did ask for a port once on my necro, but I asked for the port from a druid
friend of mine while I was on my druid, just asked him if he could port my
necro later on when he was done hunting or had a bit of free time since I
wanted to get my Necro up to Luclin (which isn't anywhere close to the EC
area at level 12)
