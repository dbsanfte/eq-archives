I completely agree.  My Necro is nearly 51 and I just started
getting him some good stuff.  Had an Oracle robe I got cheap when I
was a bit higher than you because I spent many levels killing
Treants in SK which made me a fair amount of money. Once you get to
around 40 you can solo Hill Giants for money and there are other
options for items to loot at that level too.  Myself I prefer cash
because I hate sitting in auction.
