I've heard the *shuttles* are broken.... the smaller boats such as the ones
that take you to the Maidens Voyage (Kunark Boat) or the one near the Erudin
Docks... But I know the boats themselves still work, because the one in
Erudin Comes and goes without the shuttle bringing you to it. Therefore, you
should be able to make it to FP from gfay.

Just click 'Sit'. You don't need to open the spellbook at all. Just sitting
down turns on Meditate as long as you have a point into it.

I believe you get it later on, though I've never played a bard. My
suggestion would be to go to http://eq.castersrealm.com and look up bard
skills.

I only know of http://eq.castersrealm.com Like I said, I've never played a
Bard :(
