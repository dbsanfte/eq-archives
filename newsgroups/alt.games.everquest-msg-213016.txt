Since they changed the range of what's blue to a lvl 65 (minimum lvl
50 mobs), you can make it to 65 easily with a warrior/cleric duo. Most
of PoP wouldn't work too well but even there you could kill lots of
stuff, just with downtime. I've seen a cleric/warrior duo in Tier 3
PoP but you need a well equipped warrior with AAs to pull that off. 

Check out City of Mist once you hit the mid 40s, it's a nice zone to
duo in (no runners and lots of undead) assuming they didn't mess it up
too badly with yesterdays patch. 

Later on, Old Sebilis. You could duo there till 65 without ever
hitting the bottom floor since Krups are blue to a 65 and it still
might be the best money zone in EQ. Learn the zone, become one with
the frogs! I still head back there occasionally for old time's sake
... and good plat, there's spots there where you can solo for about 1k
plat an hour which still isn't bad. 

Rgds, Frank
