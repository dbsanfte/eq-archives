It happens to me Every time I crash now, but sometimes not until after I 
log back into the game.  I've even logged back in, made pet, and then 
gotten the splash screen.  Whether the splash comes at the server 
screen, the character screen, or in game, though, one thing is certain; 
no matter whether I answer yes or no, I crash all the way down to 
windows when I answer... and no, I can't do anything but punch yes or no 
once its there.

My solution is, every time I crash, I back all the way out to desktop 
and log back into the game.  If you use escape on each screen you can 
back out pretty fast, so you only have to suffer thru logging back in.

Still, I sure miss the day when crashing to server select or to 
character select usually meant I'd be back in the game in under 30 seconds.
