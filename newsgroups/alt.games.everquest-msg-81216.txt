Yes, *never* go on a raid without the best maps you
can find, and a few of the most comprehensive strategy
guides you can track down.

*Never* rely on just being able to follow someone else.
1.  They may be an idiot.  2.  If anything happens to
them (die, LD, they are the aforementioned idiot, etc.)
suddenly you'll be operating without a net otherwise.

And with good advance research, you'll probably be
miles ahead of anyone you could have chanced to
follow anyway.
