Buy this:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004SB92/ref=e_hu_r_ts1_1/104-0016670-7747141

its a Cable/dsl firewall.  You and your friends can enjoy the 4 port hub
(you can connect an additional hub to get more people) while all enjoy
connecting to the net.  All that you need to do is set up the firewall
with the same IP information you friend has on his computer then you set
up all computers to use dhcp.  (make sure dhcp is turned on in the
firewall.)  This will remove all headaches and get you playing in the
shortest time possible.  It took me like 5 minutes to set up...
