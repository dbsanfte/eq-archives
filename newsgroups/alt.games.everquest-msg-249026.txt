I dont think your numbers are correct actually. In any event I agree that
the simple sise of the government deficit is not the only issue. The US
*current account deficit* is so bad you would have to be pretty unwise to
consider increased government expendature IMHO.  Having the largest deficit
on record *and* an out of control current account deficit *and* low growth
figures *and* high unemployment, *and* declining manufacturing base, are not
the evidence you need to support your contention that Bush is a sound
ecconomic manager.  The point I was trying to make was that it is simplistic
to say one political brand knows how to run the shop over there and the
other does not.  The market seems to agree that the current account is cause
for major concern which is why your dollar is being devauled by it. America
has a major crisis on its hands with its ecconomy only it seems to be
discussed overseas more than in the states.

The point I was trying to make was not that tweedle dum or tweedle dee in
the US were better or worse than each other. My point was that if that US
foregn policy is bad, and aims to replace dictators or leaders of other
countries with dictators, then America cannot claim the high moral ground.
It cannot claim to be the "good guys". Hence my curiosity over the
justification for the "shit list". Why is the "shit list" good if it does
not serve a decent objective? You do not seem to argue that it serves a
decent purpose, and appear to be content that its only purpose is to serve
America's singular geo political interests rather than that of humanity,
democracy etc. The shit list, its purpose and everthing done under its name
is what makes America along with all the other bullies the bad guys. You can
argue over degrees of seperation if you like but you still end up with a bad
guys versus bad guys conflict.

Given that cluster bombs were droped over densly populated civilian area,
you appear to accept therefor that the American armed forces have done lots
of collateral damage which is the point I was trying to challange you on.

If your leadership is telling you to do bad things, is it an excuse to say
"But he told me to do it"? I guess it may be to some extent if you are a
conscript as many of Sadam's troops (and now inmates) were. But if you
*choose* to join up and do what ever the dickheads at the top tell you to
do, then I dont think you have an excuse.

As for your earlier point that there was no torture taking place, I draw
your attention to the following statement by Amnesty :

"Coercive interrogation methods endorsed by members of the US government
amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and violate
international law and the USA's treaty obligations, Amnesty International
said today.... These techniques of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment are grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention, amounting to
war crimes, and violate the Convention Against Torture to which the USA is a
state party," Amnesty International reiterated."

The debate has moved on from the original spin that your government put on
the pictures. They were not pscyops. They were pictures of torture.

I think its sad when any body thinks they are justified in killing anybody
where its not self defence. The original excuse for the war was self
defence. Everybody now knows that was BS.  You seem to now accept that the
victims were in the main conscripts (non volunteers) not terrorists, and
that the torturers were volunteers. I dont understand why you feel sorry for
the torturers and not fussed about the tortured.

Ooops it was me that got this one wrong. It is Saudi Arabia that kills more
of its citizens per capita than any other country.

Ok lets look at the math my friend given that you seem interested in it.
According to Amnesty, the number of countries with the death penalty number
48. The countries without are 76. America is in the minority. Just like it
was when it lied to the rest of the world about why it was going to invade.

Nation states are not football teams. They should not be supported
irrespective of their behaviour simply because its "your team". The
implementation of America's foreign policy over the years and multiple
administrations has been a tragedy for America and the rest of the world.
