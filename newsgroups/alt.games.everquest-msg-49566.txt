Well, the area most people comment on is communication... but in
addition to that there's the exp system.  Multigroup raids generally
result in one group getting all the experience, more or less stealing
the efforts of the members of the other groups, killing things that
the group could not legitimately have taken without the help of the
others.  Its possible, with effort, to balance things out so half the
kills go to one group and half to the other, but it seems to me that
the game -could- address this by allowing designated "raid" groupings
of groups to share exp out among the entire raid in some way.
Its a minor peeve if you only do occaisional raids... heck, its a
perk if you happen to be a usual member of the KS group... but
if you move to raiding constantly and -aren't- in the KS group,
then your exp climb comes to a sudden halt.
