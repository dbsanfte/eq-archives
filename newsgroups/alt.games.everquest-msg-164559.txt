I am currently level 62, and will probably be 63 before the end of tonight.
I heard that rumor as well, but no verification from anyone, and my own
experiences are hinting that it is probably completely false.   None of the
disciplines that I use regularly,  Defensive, Evasive and Furious, have
decreased even one second from thier level 60 refresh times.

I have not tested aggressive specificly, since it's a useless discipline for
my everyday play, and logging in on my lunch, I found that I still have 14.5
minutes before I can use a discipline, so I'll have to wait until tonight to
test it.   Given the other disciplines, I seriously doubt it will have
decreased by any noticable amount.   And probably not at all.
