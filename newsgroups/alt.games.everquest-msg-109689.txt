I like this bit.

First off, it's not so much about evolution as adaptation.  It seems to me 
that humans have begun manipulating their environment, true, and gotten 
much better at manipulating their environment in bigger, bolder, and 
faster ways.  We're rapidly increasing the rate at which individual humans 
must adapt just to keep up with the environment that they (as a species) 
are manipulating.  So perhaps this will be our next selective pressure, to 
weed out all but the most fast-adapting humans.  Of course, most of the 
ones who fail will probably just go mad and go live in some 
computer-controlled virtual world somewhere and hope things calm down a 
bit later on...

Oh, excuse me, is my psychosis showing?  Eeek.  How embarassing.
