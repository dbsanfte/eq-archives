Ain't that the truth.

But the problem with the guide program wasn't just the lukewarm
support the gms gave it (though of course that was a big part), it was
also with the very rotten core at the top running it. To be perfectly
frank, too many of the seniors and elder guides were people who had no
business being there, or anywhere else where a thinking person worthy
of responsibility was required. They were in love with their closeness
to the Verant/Sony gm CS teams and would not endanger their position
for anything. Like a union boss in bed with management.

And finally the guide program was composed of people who weren't
representative of the playerbase and so made very poor in-betweens.
Way too many of them were completely clueless about many specific
situations that might have required more than a "book" response. And
finally way too many were only in it to "look cool in front of the
players".

The guide program ended in a dismal failure. There's lessons for
mmorpgs to be learned there, but is anyone listening?
