They killed your pet kitty!?!? Those bastards!!!! No wonder you hate
PvP.

The nice thing about shadowbane, is that the PvP is geared towards
actually affecting the gameworld, maing the whole place more dynamic.
Guilds setup towns, which increase the guilds territory. There is a
global map showing where the various guilds hold dominion. As the
guilds fight, and towns are destroyed, this political map changes to
keep up with current events.
