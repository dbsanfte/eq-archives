What determines it is the fact that KEI was "NEVER" intended to be
cast on ANYONE below 43 or is it 46?

So that Character that IS 5 levels too young because he/she could
never handle the mobs with a smaller mana pool and level determined
mana regen rates.

you are seeming to focus on the Bitching part.... I think that was
more of a sideline issue... The issue is the YOUNG player is taking
all the spawns because they have a buff that was never intended for
them.  
Lower level zones (lets say sub 40) were never designed to 1 person or
group monopolize the entire area...  

Its rather obvious that they were fixing a screw up, that they waited
way to long to fix.  You just happen to be unhappy with the way the
game was designed to operate.
