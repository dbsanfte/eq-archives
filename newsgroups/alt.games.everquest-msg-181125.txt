My opinion is that mages and wizards are pretty well balanced against
each other.

Wizards can quad kite with BoF, they can do crowd control with Root,
and they can evac.  All of these things are non-trivial advantages.

Wizard nukes are also better than mage nukes.  Plus wizards have
access to fire, cold, and magic nukes, which is good situationally.
Several mage nukes require line of sight, which is less convenient.
Mage nuke upgrades often skip a spell level which can be painful.

All in all both classes have nice advantages and seem rather well
balanced against each other.
