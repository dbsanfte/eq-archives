I can give you a rundown of how your CoH experience will likely go:

1) First day: Character creation --
Wow! this is awesome! Man, there are so many options for customizing my 
own character.
2) First day: playing --
Sweeeeeet! This is how combat should be! Man, these guys got it right! 
This is nothing but pure fun. The fact that there is no real loot is 
great. makes everything so simple! You just kill kill kill.

3) During first week:
This game rocks! I've been making all kinds of characters! There are 
just so many options!

4) 3 weeks later:
Ugh. I've tried all the variations and *sigh*, there really isn't much 
to this game. I'm fighting the same mobs over and over and over again. 
There are no real quests. There is nothing to fight for since there is 
no real loot. I do get new powers when I level but, for the most part, 
you use the same powers you acquired during the first 10 levels.

5) 2 Days before your first 30 days are up: (this was me)
Cancel.

Then I found EQ and got hooked in the *real* mmorpg genre again.

Basicaly CoH is a first person shoot. If you don't mind paying 15/mo for 
the depth of a first person shooter then go for it. The combat 
absolutely rocks in CoH, there is no arguing that IMO. But the game 
lacks depth. There is literally *nothing* to fight *for*. You're ONLY 
purpose is to gain levels. There is no item to quest for, there is no 
reason to advance other than getting new powers and, as I said above, 
your core set of powers are gained in the first 10-15 levels.

In the end, you're simply fighting the same stuff again and again. The 
high-level content, from what I hear, is a pure grind. You spend a week 
to gain a level and all that does is give you access to a new skill that 
you likely don't need. Since there is no loot, there isn't much to work 
towards.

Just my take. ;)
