I pretty much Solo'd to 35 as a warrior (after that it can't really be done,
although it is possible to solo thru 43 - 45 in OT with care)

The problem is I wrecked a few factions I didn't care to much about doing so
and hunted NPC's that, maybe, weren't there to be killed. Killed Tolus and
Reskin (Guards in EC) Travis (Bard in Nek forest) and Leatherfoot deputy,
when I could find him. I was actually trading in EC a lot so this suited me
fine. Travis, Tolus and Reskin are 25th, Blue till 33 I think and, since you
are alone, the exp you get is pretty good. I used to hunt (slaughter) the
bandits in WK for sashes, collect 40+ and hand them in. This would make
small amount of exp for the 2hrs it took but, depending on the luck with
Bronze weapon drops, would net me 150 - 200pp (you have to basically take 3
camps to make this work but at your playing time that shouldn't be a
problem) this would make up for lack of loot from the NPC's you are killing
for exp.

This is not a great solution, it worked for me because I don't care for
rushing thru the levels and enjoy trading. Unfortunately, Solo, the Warrior
is one of the weakest classes in the game (the weakest is prolly the Rogue,
I'm talking Solo, before you get up in arms about this) and although you are
considered the best for the job you do in a group there is little versatily
to work outside one, where a Paladin, SK or Ranger would have a much easier
time of it.

I know how frustrating this is, my primary is a Warrior and I often log on
in the morning at the weekends to play, only to find the groups I'm in start
to split up as it's the early hours in the US (or any Euro's I'm with have
actually been playing all night and think it's time to sleep as the sun is
up, lol) This was one of the reasons I started farming in Runnyeye, I had
f*ck all else to do at the time.

Forget about hunting white mobs solo, not going to happen. As the levels go
up so does the power of the Mobs but you don't (not in comparison) you have
maybe 35 hp more than last level to take on a mob that hits for quad 60's,
great. The way you are able to deal with this is the more powerful heals and
buffs from casters to keep you alive. Warriors (melee classes) really need
to be able to Bind to 75% HP (sooner than 50th or whenever Monks are
currently able to) This would give them less down time if they decide to
solo even then it would be faster, by far to group and wouldn't unbalance
the game, but that's just the opinion of someone who does not want to play a
Necro or a Druid but would like to get on when America sleeps <sigh> Oh
well.

Basically, forget solo'ing as a warrior, it can be done, up to a point, it
is really slow and really dangerous if you want to get levels fast OT is the
place (I used it after 35) and yes I know it is monotonous, the same can be
said for Dreadlands...Not sure where I'm off to after I hit 48, suggestions
on a post card, please, need pick up groups, Guild raids/Events only cost me
exp (and sometimes plat) I'm sorry to say.

If the warrior is your primary then you're not really likely to have
anything better than Crafted at 32, I didn't. not until 40.
