I'll sometimes do that on purpose.

After 51 levels, I've collected so much stuff that my
regular "bring with me" gear leaves only about 12 open
slots, and my bank is full (even after sliding most
spare armor/weapons that I haven't gotten around to
auctioning off onto a storage character).

So when I need to do some tradeskills that involve a
lot of nonstackable items, or quests that require carrying
a lot of items (e.g. carrying 40 stacks of Red Wine into
Neriak), I arrange to have myself dueled to death
(which results in no lost exp).  Then when I 
respawn at my bind point I just buy 8 cheap Backpacks
and I now have 64 slots of open inventory to work with
while my corpse acts as a "locker" for my original
equipment.

Then when I'm done tradeskilling/questing/whatever,
I sell off my cheap backpacks and loot my original stuff.
