There is a vendor or two in Freeport that sells them. I'm not sure who but I
think there is one outside the Wiz/Mage/Enc guild in west freeport and I
know there is a lady on the second floor inside the casters guild in
freeport that sells them. not sure of eithers names. Wiz/Mage/Enc guild also
has fish for Enduring breath, and all the gems for various caster spells.
