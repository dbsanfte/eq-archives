I do this all the time. Float in on the barge, step off, levitate,
boogie on over. Now I can track, so I don't have to ask about ol Fay
anymore. Just in case <grin> when I get in the porter room, I cast
bind in the off hopes that it will somehow work....
Can you imagine never having to bind again, and an instant teleport to
most any city with just a Gate?  <droool>
