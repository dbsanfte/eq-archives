That's great for a layperson to say. But its not a case of just not 
finding the sequence... its like looking at a digital watch and 
insisting that it 'evolved' and we just haven't found the sequence. Its 
absurd.

"... many innovations cannot possibly come into existence through 
accumulation of many small steps, and even if they can, natural 
selection cannot accomplish it, because incipient and intermediate 
stages are not advantageous" (Lovtrup, 1987).

The basis for the conflict is on the idea of 'irreducible complexity', 
and many biologists agree that many biochemical systems are irreducibly 
complex, and thus cannot 'evolve in intermediate stages' and especially 
not through 'natural selection'.

Here's an article on the subject...

This is getting a little too convenient.

There are multiple competing theories of 'evolution', darwinian 
gradualism, punctuated equilibrium, neo-Darwinian to name a few all of 
which conflict with each other, each of which explains some particular 
observed phenomena.

None of them can be right, because they all make -different- predictions 
and in each case some of those predictions explain something in the 
fossile record, and some of them -conflict- with the fossil record. And 
of course, none of them deal with irreducibly complex biochemical 
systems.

There is little cause to label this an 'accusation of creationists'. 
Even many 'evolutionists' consider these grave flaws in the theory.
