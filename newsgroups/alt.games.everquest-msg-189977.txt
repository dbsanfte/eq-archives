I'm level 14 and just sold silks for about 800.  Gave me about 850, total.
If I hadn't gone and bought a bunch of stuff, I could have gotten over 1000
easily before I make my next level.  Easy come, easy go.  The point is,
there is money to be made, even at low levels.  Also, let's face it. My
level 14 wizard doesn't need 350kpp, because he wouldn't be able to
effectively equip anything that actually cost that much.  Now, 5kpp, that
would make for some fun shopping. ;-)

Cheers,
Eric
