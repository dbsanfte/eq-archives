Well, there's quite a difference between the Final Fantasy game series and
the movie: one was regularly high-quality and had huge sales and profits,
and other costed a lot of money to make and just plain sucked.  Sony has so
much capital and revenue that adding an extra $1.2 million a month is going
to make no more of a difference than adding a drop of water to a lake.
Expect any extra money made by EQ to go right back into it for expansion
development, and maybe, just maybe, more CS, though I'm betting on the
former. ;-)
