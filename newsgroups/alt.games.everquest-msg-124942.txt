Bloody possums running through the roof most of time, every now and again
interspersed with some solid marsupial humpings. Well, at least summer is
over (here), we have a gum tree out back that has sugary blossums which
ferment in the sun, and if there's one thing worse than a gaggle of possums
in the room then it's a  gaggle of drunk possums....
