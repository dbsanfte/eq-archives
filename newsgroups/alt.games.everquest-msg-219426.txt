Mmm, Lance where DO you get this skewed info from?  I wonder sometimes
really I do.  Rogues have decent defensive skills - far away  the best
of all the chain classes with Shaman MILES behind.  Rogues WILL have
more HPs than Shaman all other things being equal.

So, in any reasonable definition of the term Rogues tank better than
Shaman.  There was a similar thread on the Rangers Glade recently and
many people missed the point there also if that's any comfort.
