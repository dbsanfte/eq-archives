I recently reinstalled Windows XP.  Everything, for the most part,
seems to function alright with one exception: that mouse problem that a
lot of people had when they set up the game to use the system mouse.
As some will recall, the mouse would work in windowed mode but not
full-screen mode.

My question: Anyone remember how to fix this?  Wasn't there some MS
patch you had to download or something like that?
