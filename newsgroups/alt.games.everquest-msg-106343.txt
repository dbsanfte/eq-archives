Few things you should know as a Druid with Porting skills...

1) Anon/RP is your friend.
2) Always ask upfront if you expect people to pay.
3) Never rip off the portee.  You are now a porting Druid...  Your rep is
now on the line.
4) Know and identify the hazards of porting to the portee...  This means KOS
areas, Areas that are dangerous, and areas where you are going to do a "Hot
port".

Why?

1) Anon/RP is your friend for one reason...  To avoid requests for porting
when you are in a group or busy and do not want to port.  If you want to be
left alone, Anon/Roleplay on.  If players can't get the hint you are not
porting, they don't deserve the port.

2) If you want to be paid...  Ask upfront.  Unless you want to be nice,
don't expect to be paid by a person bugging you for a port.  Some players
consider Druids and Wizards their own personal taxi, that it isn't YOUR time
they are taking, you are just a person doing nothing and they are giving you
the benefit of doing something.

3) Ripping off a portee is bad for business.  Most servers have rant
boards...  And when people rant, there is a chance of building a rep that
will stain you and will prevent you from getting into a decent guild, a
decent raid, getting a Rez when you need it, or get kicked out of your own
guild because they are tired of the complaints about you ripping the portee.

4) Know and talk with the people you are porting.  When they show up,
identify their race.  Iksars, Dark Elves, Trolls and Orges are hated by the
Druids hanging out at EK, NK and West Commons.  NEVER PORT THEM without
provisions.  Know your destinations...  Iceclad, Cobalt Scar, Wakening
Lands, Skyfire (Winds of the North), and Emerald Jungle (Winds of the South)
are not 100% safe port locations.  There is a chance of a wandering mob that
will slap you silly before you get a spell to get out.  Great Divide for
Druids is an almost safe zone to port into.  These zones I consider 'Hot
Port' zones for druids.  These are zones you port people to, then get the
hell out as quick as you can, especially Skyfire and Emerald Jungle, because
even having one guy casting Invis/Camo on you will not get off his own in
time before the portal is made.  Lastly, there was a big stint from some
other guy about wanting a port to Gfay, only to be ported to Butcher Block.
Be sure to tell them WHERE you are taking them...  Do not port them until
they KNOW that is your intention, and do not take their money until they
KNOW where they are going.

BTW, welcome to the hell of being a Druid.
