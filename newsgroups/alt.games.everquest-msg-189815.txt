Ask any cleric or druid you happen to see about this island; they'll tell
you all about it.

Fay spawns there, one of the key mobs for the druid epic.

The NPC's by the inn are at the center of the cleric epic.  Every time a
cleric kills an epic mob, he or she trudges all the way to this "secret
island" to turn in the drops and get told where to go next.  After killing
Ragefire, they head back here and do their turn-ins to actually get their
epic.  I still have a very clear image of doing the very last turn-in and
seeing my epic appear on my cursor.  ^_^

It's waaaaaay on the edge of the map, far from where any boat goes.  I
almost always had to swim there.  When I did my final epic turn-in, I was
fortunate to have a bard along to help me run quickly on top of the water.

There are indeed two tunnels you need to swim through to get there.  Some
supplies are sold at the inn, nothing extraordinary.  When I did my final
epic turn-in, the warrior with me went up and bought ale for everyone to
consume.

It's really not much to look at - a beach, some water, an inn, a vendor,
some cleric and duid epic npc's.  And it takes a long time to get there.  No
real point in going there - unless it's just something you want to see.
I've done that before; I heard about the "chessboard" in Butchblock and took
a long boat ride there just to see what it was and what the mobs were like.
=)  One of these days I'm gonna try and make a run to see the Plane of
Mischief, just to say that I've been there.
