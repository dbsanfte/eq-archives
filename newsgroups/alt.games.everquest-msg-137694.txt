Personally I would have a couple different options available to me. And it
alot of it depends on situation. if it's a massive overpull and cleric is in
danger I don't have problem with tank getting agro off cleric. I'd try to
root that mob(s) and get the cleric away and then tell warrior to back up.
I'm also an in your face enchanter. I run up, stun, tash (if I feel I have
time or don't wanna risk a resist/stun/tash/stun/mez routine)

my spell line up is tash, mez, stun, stun, root and has been those for a
long time now (55 chanter now)

run up, stun, root, back up, /g target rooted switch back tank
tash, root, back away
slow (thus normally gaining agro yourself and pulling away from
cleric/warrior), stun, root/mez/tash routine
couple stuns in a row normally gets some good agro on you. with a good
cleric to keep you alive nothing to worry about tho
hell if it's a big problem load up charm and charm the adds. 'WTF aren't you
helping your tank like this nice Target is? Stupid group mates' (probably
not so rough but hey, normally groups need chanters not other way around so
be bosy :) I'm not that mean but I do get pushy :)

as a enchanter your way of playing is up to you. your success depends on
being flexible and comfortable with what your doing. by level 30 ppl should
be learning how to work with an enchanter.

HOTKEYS ARE EVERYTHING. heh I hav hotkeyes that announce everything I do...
mezzing target, rooting target, tashing target, bleh... no confusion
normally... could probably make up a hotkey /rooting target BACK THE FREAK
AWAY heh...

ppl tend to think I'm a little crazy as an enchanter tho so :) good luck
hope this helps I'm tired and babbling atm

Peace
