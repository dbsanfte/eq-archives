Not really relevant, since my mention of ISP was for financial
backing. Try reading and thinking and you can see I'm referring to web
host servers with what you quoted. Game servers, however, are by
nature more "twitchy" than ISP servers, anyway.

Server problems like the recent ones are rare. The server stability
record that they've had has been great overall. Go get a fucking job
at SOE and run their servers better if you think you can do it. Write
them a nice business letter explaining exactly what they're doing
wrong and exactly how to fix them in civil terms, and a guarantee that
they'll hire you. If you know so much more about running servers than
they do, educate them. Whining about what a horrible job they're doing
here won't do any good. If you think they're ripping you off, leave or
help them do a better job.

This is the same old song and dance that comes along when ANY problem
comes up with ANY servers, not just EQs. People piss and moan about
what a horrible job of maintaining the servers is being done, but all
these self-proclaimed "experts" never seem to be willing to pony up
details on how to do a better job. Have you ever run a game server as
large and complex as EQ? Do you honestly have any clue what it takes
to keep it running stable? If you've never run one, you're working off
assumptions and wild guesses, in which case, you're only making a
total ass of yourself.

I see plenty of reason. MMORPGs have to track more players and more
in-depth worlds than other 3D game systems.

How about expenses of employee salaries, regular office costs, a live
dev team, and so forth? Less than half of that 60mil probably ends up
going toward the servers, and most of that is probably eaten by
bandwidth costs. Then there are the servers. We're talking a LOT of
machines constantly running, constantly tracking player and mob
locations and activities. Then there are regular marketing costs and
promotions. Then, above all those costs, EQ has to show a certain
level of PROFIT for SOE to justify keeping it running.

Each zone is NOT on a separate machine. Each machine hosts SEVERAL
zones. It's still a huge task for each server farm to handle.
