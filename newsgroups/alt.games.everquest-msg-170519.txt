Condemn? What condemn? He suggested a way that a writer could imply a speech
pattern or accent effectively. I passed that on. If you chose to call it
"stupid" oh well.

Let me speak frankly. Writing vernacular phonetically in a word-for-word
fashion is not "quite useful" or even somewhat useful if you want your work
to be read, bought, or published. It _could_ be useful if your goal is to
get your manuscript laughed at and tossed in the trash. It's a dead form. To
suggest that it is useful to a modern writer because Twain used it 150 years
ago is as logical as submitting a manuscript written in Shakespearean
English and hoping for a best seller.

That's my opinion based on my experience as a published author who was
trained by best-selling authors. You are entitled to your opinion based on
whatever experience you draw from.
