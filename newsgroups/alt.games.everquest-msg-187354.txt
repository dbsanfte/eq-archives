No, dipshit.

It is perfectly reasonable to assume from what I said I was talking
about a ZEM that wasn't the DEFAULT.

It's not very hard to figure out, though apparently it blew you out of
the water.

Yes. I. Did. And not only that, I can give you google links of me
REPLYING to posts about ZEM before.

Would that make you give up this idiocy? Woud you finally admit you
were wrong?

No, a zero ZEM in the context of what is being talked about is the
DEFAULT.

THE FUCKING DEFAULT, YOU RETARD.

It's been already pointed out to your pea sized intellect that the
precise formula wasn't known! Obviously there's nothing wrong with
assuming a zero ZEM is a default for a zone given that.

No, it's not. Sigh.

Yes, I did, fuckwit. You don't need to know how mass and distance fit
into the formula for gravity to accept you're lighter on the moon.

Man this is so easy a concept a gradeschooler could figure it out. But
no, you wanted to prove how knowledgable you are. Congratulations! You
have proven you know the formula for a ZEM at the price of coming off
as a totall egotistical asshole! Hope it was worth it.

I already knew what a ZEM was, it was the modifier to experience of a
zone. Obviously the question meant "DL has a NON--DEFAULT ZEM?"

Do you get it yet? Do you? Does your fucking idiot brain comprehend
this or do I have to drive it in with a fucking hammer?

Apparently we would, since that was EXACTLY what I asked. Given your
appalling inability to understand common English, I imagine we could
have gotten the same thread if I had commented on how long it takes to
boil eggs.

I wasn't aware of the formula. I see a number that doesn't
particularly look like any sort of default number (one would assume
zero or 100, but 75?) and jumped to a wrong conclusion.

That doesn't mean I didn't know what a ZEM was, you idiot.

Right back atcha. Think you can do it, smart guy? Even other posters
are telling you you're wrong now.
