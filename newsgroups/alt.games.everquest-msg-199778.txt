It's even worse than that.   He says 28 damage, 22 delay.    There are no
swords that even come close to that damage / delay (that are not Paladin /

Actually, Rogues will still outdamage Warriors, even without critical stab.
It's just that they will be doing some ~5% more damage than an equally
equipped warrior, while they could be doing ~40% more damage than the
warrior if they were attacking from behind.
