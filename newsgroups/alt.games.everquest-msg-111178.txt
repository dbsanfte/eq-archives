OK, that's pretty much what we did, though we don't really have enough DPS 
to do a 10-11 minute fight.  We figured we're looking at 18 minutes, but 
that was based on reports of it taking up to 30 minutes to kill him.  I 
suspect we can get him pretty easily with two repops, though if we try 
with the right wall idea again, we'll let the wall group kill the mobs to 
ensure that they can keep up with respawn.  
We do tell the wall group that they are not to leave the wall for any 
reason, though we're mulling over the idea of a wall-helper group that 
will go over and help if the wall group starts to fall behind.  
Have you experiemented with standing behind IV and hoping that the wall 
will keep the knockback from being a problem.  Of course it's tight there, 
and staying at the edge of the melee bubble may be a problem.  Hmmmmm, I 
might try that with DA song and a CoH mage.
