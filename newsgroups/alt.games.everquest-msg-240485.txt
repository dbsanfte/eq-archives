There isn't really a more AD&D-like MMORPG than Everquest - D&D Online
is coming out sometime in the future, but that's 3rd Edition D&D so
while it's closer it's still quite different.  All the other fantasy
MMORPGs are at least as divergent from D&D as Everquest is, and many
of them more (Ultima Online, for instance, which doesn't even have
levels).

Starting over on Firiona Vie is probably best - I'm guessing you're on
Sullon Zek now, and that server is a griefer's paradise, so unless
you're after spending most of your time getting killed by players, or
killing other players, you'd do best to avoid it.
