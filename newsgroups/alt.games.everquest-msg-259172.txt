Dude, I bet you're kicking yourself now. That original Suspended package is 
worth at least $100 on ebay. Most of the other Infocom games are worth a 
decent amount also if original packaging and "feelies" are all intact. I 
once had several Infocom originals but sold them before they became a big 
collector item.
