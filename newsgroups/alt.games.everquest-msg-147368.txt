*Thank* you. That's all the bazaar needs is gamble spam. Of course
it's just my opinion, but personally I think gambling in EQ is pretty
retarded. I mean, at least at the horse track you can do some research
and increase your chances. In EQ the whole game is designed for you to
lose more often than you win or lose more money than you end up
winning. It's a fool's game.

I like my stuff/pp too much to give it away.
