    I see you've done that annoying treant in PoG too! I always bring my 55
rogue to PoG for faction reasons (and so she can get all the rot rogue
armour, woo-hoo!) When we did that treant I stripped off all my buffs faster
than anyone else and spammed for a dispel, and lived. The people who were a
bit more blase about it died.

    Sounds like it would be useful when soloing too, to get rid of stuff
