*comes out of hiding*

> What's your favorite race (overall):

I'm stuck between Erudite and Dark Elves and Iksars.  You can strut, sneer,
and be a pompous and arrogant person.  Sometimes it's just fun to state that
you are a superior life form, and all other forms of life are really just
pond scum compared to your own race.  Being an Iksar presents it's own
challenges.  I like playing them as a cold, pragmatic, and twisted.  Most
other races are good for food, and Halfings are especially tasty.

> Favorite Race group (as in Wood Elf/High Elf/Half Elf,
> Barbarian/Human/Erudite, etc.):

I'll have to go with Dark Elf/Ogre/Troll/Iksar.  Sometimes being evil is
just plain fun.

> Favorite Race/Class combo:

Erudite Wizard.  Pure nostalgia, as it was my very first character.
