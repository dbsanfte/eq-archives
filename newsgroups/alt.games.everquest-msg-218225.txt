Fortunately, he made the original claim, so the burden of proof is
on him, not me.  That makes it acceptable for me to call "bullshit"
without further elaboration.  It's his/her job to supply evidence
along with the claim.

I find it interesting you let *his/her* claim without a shred of
proof slide, but you found it necessary to make snide comments in
my direction.  Are you republican, by any chance?  :)
