*boggle*

If he has a friend with the CD's why not just use them to install the
expansions ?

You can use any CD to install the game, but everyone needs unique Key (which
should not eefect the poster as once the key is used its attached to the
account info and does not need to be entered again)

Or so it seems to work for me (I have 3 machines running eq 3 sets of
expansions, but can all be installed off one set)
