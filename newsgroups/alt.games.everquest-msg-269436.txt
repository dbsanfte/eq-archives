Now that I am playing Everquest II, is it possible to give away my
Everquest Evolution disks to somebody else who might want to play?  My
Brother would like this game and with a machine that has fewer
resources, he likely could not play Everquest II anyway.  Can I give him
the disks and let him setup his own account, or will they not allow him
to setup the account since I have already used the CD Key?  What if my
account is inactive [it will be on Jan 5, 2005]? 

Thanks in advance!
