}In the announcement that executives made at a world-wide AIDS
}conference, they stated that that it was being developed for South
}Africa and was being discussed for the US..
}The justified public outcry caused them to back-pedal on THAT plan
}furiously.  

Now you see, if one executive says to another executive, "Heh, you know, 
we'd never get this to fly in the US.  Let's not even consider it."  That 
would be discussing it for the US, would it not?  And yet, strangely, in 
that remark, they've made no 'plan' to show it in the US at all, so they 
aren't going to have to backpedal anything.  Of course, not being the 
journalist who was looking to break big news and cause a public outcry, I 
have no idea exactly how the 'discussion' went.  But said journalist 
couldn't bring themselves to honestly say 'and is planned for the US'.  
Hmmm.

Look!  A shadow!
*Bark* *Bark*

}NOW their story is that there is no plan, no discussion about bringing
}it to the US at all...

Which may not be a change at all.

Get thyself to a dictionary.  Look up 'plan' and 'discuss'.  I think 
you'll be amazed how completely not the same thing they are.
