Hmm As someone who's played a bard to over 50 three tims I would have to
disagree with the advice given...

The only stats you should be concerned with (in order of priority) are:

Get all stats at (or close to) 75.  From there get:
1) Dex get it as close to 100 as possible
2) Charisma (get it as close to 100 as possible)
(note, 1 and 2 are interchangeable depending on how you plan to play.  I
recommend charisma for anyone who is serious about crowd control, charm or
whatever as a bard)
3) Strength (whatever is left)

The reasons for this are simple.  Even at level 1 our songs are FAR more
important than our melee ability.  With them we can make up for any
deficiency we have in Melee combat.  Without them we're a waste of server
space.

Dex and Charisma are important to a bard for 2 reasons:  1st and foremost,
Dex and Charisma determine your fizzle rate, for every point they are (both)
above 75 that is 1% less chance of missing a note on a song.  2nd is that
Dex is a huge factor in determining the rate at which weapons process and
Charisma is a tremendous factor in many of our songs:
Lullaby (16)
Lament (8)
Charm (27)
Pixie Strike (28)
Fear (26)
Charm (39)

Etc.  Our charisma directly affects how well these songs perform.  Until
level 53 a bard is heavily reliant upon their charisma for crowd control
purposes.

Many folk say not to worry about charisma as it's very easy to raise.  While
this is true it makes getting armor class difficult because very few GOOD AC
items carry charisma on them.  I tend to focus on CHA during char creation
so that I can worry more about AC in items.  (Because most high AC items
carry strength and dex but not charisma)

Hope this helps!!
