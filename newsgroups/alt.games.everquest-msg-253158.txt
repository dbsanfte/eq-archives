"WHERE does it say all his stuff is ancient?  Some stuff that he got three
years ago might be considered that, but what about the movie he downloaded
yesterday?  Is that ancient?  And, what rock have you been living under if
you have been using a Pent 60 three years ago?  Please, if you're going to
flame, get a little better at it...8-)

Sorry if I am being a little abrupt.  Something about that response just
bugged the he77 out of me.  OK, I'll be nice now.

Cheers!
