For the most part you are correct it is true that you cannot own a spawn but
there is also un unwritten rule among players not to steal rare spawns.
Prime example in Ocean of Tears the Ancient Cyclops (AC) spawn is very
heavily camped 1 spawn site 6 min spawn the AC is a random spawn very rare.
I have been on the camp for 14 hours without seeing the AC. I have seen days
go by with out the AC spawning. The only way to keep from having chaos there
is to have a list and use an honor system. Can you imagine having 5 groups
watching the spawn for say 8 hours and the AC spawns who can say was the
first to attack. and the rest petitioning say it was KSed
