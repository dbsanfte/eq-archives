Clarification here: Soloing druids usually go for evok. Grouping druids go
for alteration.

You can change your specialization via a Temple of Sol Ro quest- but it is a
serious PITA. Even if you do not group a lot now at 30, you may later at
50+.

To set your spec after training, sit in a safe place and cast over and over
and over again until that spec goes over 50.
