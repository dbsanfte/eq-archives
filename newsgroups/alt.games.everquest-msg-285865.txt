So I assume the new skeleton/mummy mobs that were showing up in lots
of zones (and apparently with levels scaled to fit the zones) are part
of the "throngs of undead", but I haven't noticed that there's much to
be done with them yet.

And I assume the red skies in most zones are due to the sun withering.
The reddish tint on everything is rather distracting, since the last
time I saw that it was because my monitor was going bad!  I guess it's
an easy way to add atmosphere to the story line.

Anyway, I'll be looking for folks to help me summarise TBS for the FAQ,
since I'm not likely to buy the expansion any time soon.

One item in particular that I noticed is that the Inventory window now
has a new tab for "other currencies" or something like that, but I didn't
see any mention of those in the release message.  Are they like the DoN
crystals or what?

I assume that you have to have bought the expansion in order to use
this "port to banner" facility?  Or is there a new portal-setting
stone that's available to everyone?

This could be interesting, but I'm curious about the mechanics.  Are
the tokens expended when you use them to transport, and if so how do
you get another?  (I.e., from the description, it sounds like even a
pickup group could form a Fellowship, go somewhere to hunt, set up a
campfire, and then if someone dies, or heck if someone wants to gate
back to get something from the bank, they can just port back to the
campfire.  Is this really an infinite-charges "gate to group" function?
Also, what sorts of effects do the campfire upgrades offer and how
expensive are they?

> Fellowships have a maximum of six players

So the Fellowship from Lord of the Rings wouldn't qualify, eh?  Though
I can see why they limit it to the size of one group, it does feel a bit
contrary to tradition not to allow a Fellowship to have 7 members.

> - Energeian Power Source Items

This sounds amazingly complex for what it adds, but I'll let others
comment on whether it's worth the hassle.

I wish they'd included at least a "boundaries of the zone" map.  I went
and located the Erudin and Paineel zone-outs and marked them on my
otherwise blank map.  (Yes, I'm sure new maps are available at the usual
places, but I like to wait a week or so for improvements to fill in
before I download maps for an expansion.)

> *** User Interface Changes ***

Now this was a pleasant surprise, having them list the UI files they
changed so folks who've modified those files in their UI will know they
need to reconcile the changes.
