I did a halfling warrior totally untwinked just after they changed the xp curve to test it.

I have never played a warrior over 15 (not that that would help the 1-10 
experience much)
I did get a couple of unsolicited buffs off people and was given a nice 
ish axe when I was level 8.5

I made ten in about 3.5 hours played.

Having said that I only had one weapon skill worth squat and I had no 
armour.

HTH
