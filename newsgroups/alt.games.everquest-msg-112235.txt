    My monk has half a dozen pulling messages.  All run
along the lines of "Running from %t (yellow) and %s is out
for my blood."  I have five for each of the con colors, and
one generic one in case I don't get a chance to con my pull
first.  I've had lots of people ask what the command is to
get the con into the pulling message.  For some reason, when
I tell them that they are all unique hotkeys, most tell me
that's not worth the time to them to set up for themselves. 
Well, it was worth it to me, certainly.  It only gets
annoying when I group with a person a couple of levels
higher than me, who always follows my message with "You mean
it's yellow to _your_ con. Lol."   Well, yeah.  How the hell
am I supposed to know how it cons to other people?
   But these are the only battle spam messages I have
hotkeyed, with any of my characters.  I tend to get annoyed
when every heal, snare, dot, or nuke is announced.  The only
exception is when something is mezzed... this is truly
critical information for the group to have.
