Except that pure casters can *still* "meditate and engage in
combat in outside zones" after today's nerf.  Only hybrids
(who actually use autofight while "engaging in combat")
have had something taken away from them today.

Wizards/Druids/Shamans/Enchanters/Mages/Necromancers can
still recover mana as if meditating while actively
nuking/DoTing the hell of out stuff from horseback.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, I just wish
hybrids hadn't been hosed.  It was nice (but hardly
overpowering) while it lasted.

Personally, I think that
*everyone* (horse or no) should be able to "med while
standing" at, say, 51, in the same way that they're
able to "lose the spellbook" at 35.  It would reduce
the horrendous downtime, would make it feasible to
actually dungeon crawl instead of having to choose
a spot for the casters to all sit rooted on their
butts 80% of the time, and yet still require people
to conserve their mana and use it responsibly (since
at high levels, even the sit-and-med mana recovery
rate is a slow crawl compared to how fast you burn it off
during a fight).
