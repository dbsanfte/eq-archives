That's an unrealistically optimistic take. In the real world he should 
expect not to make any raid progression at all.

Your suggesting he should be content to play by himself in old content? 
Perhaps hoping against hope to regularly bump into raid size forces of 
fellow bi-weekly offpeakers on their way to <older high end zone>? And 
that he will progress in this way, albeit slower, but at a rate 
proportial to the amount he plays?

It doesn't work like that.
