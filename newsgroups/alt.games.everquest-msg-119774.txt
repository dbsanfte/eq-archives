>troubled gaming addict takes his life

I think the key word in this article is "troubled" and from the sounds of it he
had a lot of problems even before he started.  One thing I find surprising is
his mother was so concerned yet he apparently isolated himself from all human
contact for a period of two weeks before she went to find out what was going
on? Wtf is up with that?
