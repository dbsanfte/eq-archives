I believe it's basically finding a single mob out in the open that won't
have buddies join in then casting darkness on them to dot and slow, sending
pet into attack, fearing the mob and letting your pet beat it silly while it
runs off. Of course you'd be following fairly close behind to drop another
poison or darkness as needed. Rinse repeat till mob is dead.
