I understand being an "old-timer" regarding gaming. Been there, done
that, and still don't recall lambasting someone like that unless they
were asking for a way to steal the game or cheat on realms (which are
suppose to be cheat-free.)

If you (collective you) don't like those posts, just don't answer.

Yes, it's a wonder I was flamed to hell and back. As for laughing, no
one did that as a post until I was covered in flames. Laughing doesn't
bother me. I'd have likely replied with a "well duh, color me
embarrassed, guess I'll take kitchen duty for the next week." Laughing
and humor are fine, attacks are not.

>not very smart. Laugh it off and move on. 

So I need to be paranoid and assume the group is a bunch of trigger
happy flamers before posting, but then get accused of being paranoid
for posting. Yeah ok.

As for moving on, will do, as soon as everyone else does.
