Does not work, and AFAIK, never did.  I have never looked into it that 
carefully, but, I do know that the priest class combines require the LoY 
book that is nodrop, and can only be obtained by a person of the 
appropriate class.  Is the LoY book required for the high level INT caster 
combines as well?  The ones for spells like KEI and such.
