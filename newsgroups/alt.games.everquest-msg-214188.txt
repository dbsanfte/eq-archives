>What are the best spells 
>to use for soloing and what tactics should I be using once I leave Paludal.

For soloing at your level my spell line up was usually something like:
heal
skin like rock
thistlecoat
firefist
flame lick
panic animal
snare
grasping roots
(sow & buffs on top, attack spells on bottom - roots always in the last 2
spaces, I still do it this way at 56).  Keep all your buffs on at all times
especially thistlecoat.
Overthere and Lake of Ill Omen are good for wide open spaces with lots of
animals to snare/fear, and I always use flame lick. Get your skill maxed in
taunt while you are soloing, you'll be glad you did when you are in a group. 
In a few levels go to Eastern Wastes and play over by the bridge to Iceclad. 
You'll use your tracking all the time.  And keep "bind wound" maxed too - your
healing sucks.  You forage Tufts of Dire Wolf Fur in EW.  They sell in the
bazaar for 40 plat.  Gotta love it.  (Other foraged goods that sell well
include vegetables and all berries.  Don't eat em!  Get yourself some stat food
for your first food slot and force feed iron rations and save the vegies...)
Once you get Stinging Swarm keep that on the monsters too.  
You'll also have no trouble finding groups in those same areas because your
tracking makes you the logical puller.  If you get turned around in a strange
place you can use your tracking to lead you back to your group - track the
cleric or enchanter, they stay seated :)  Single pull from the Rygorr camps in
EW using harmony.  South Karana spires and Splitpaw are great if you are in a
group.
Snare the mob if it tries to run away, root adds if there is no enchanter. 
Keep the cleric sowed once you get sow.  If there's a "real" tank don't use
your taunt key unless you are trying to get the mob off the casters.  And if
you are still getting beat up step back and quit attacking untiil the warrior
gets agro back.  He has better armor and hitpoints than you do.
If you are secondary / backup tank it's your job to get the mob off the cleric
RIGHT NOW, enchanter will usually mez him but make sure and ask up front so you
aren't attacking a mezzed mob!!!!!!  
Ok... i've rambled for long enough....
