No, you need to not warp things to fit into your arguments.

What?  You really don't understand the meaning of heal, do you?

Since you're not going to pick up a dictionary, I'll give you a link to
one's definition of the word.

Maybe in your way of thinking of things, but slowing something doesn't heal
something else.

Get rid of the cleric?!  Boot someone from your group because it's less than
perfect?!  If you did this to me, I'd never group with you or anyone from
that group again.  Never.  All of you would be on my No Rez / Let Em Die
list.  That list is one step lower than my No Group list.  Hmmm.  Since
clerics are so wanted in "end game", I wonder if I could get YOU booted from
raids that would like me to join them.  First, I wouldn't want to be part of
anything you would be part of and secondly, it would be rather nice form of
sweet revenge.
