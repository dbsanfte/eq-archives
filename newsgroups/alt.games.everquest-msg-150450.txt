"Wake the Dead
This ability calls the shade of a nearby corpse back to life to serve
the Necromancer. The soulless abomination will fight the target, until
called back to the afterlife some time later. The slave summoned by
the first rank of this ability serves for 60 seconds, and each
increasing rank adds 15 additional seconds. You may train the ranks of
this ability at or after levels 61, 63, and 65. "

That one looks promising :)
Does that mean the necro will have "soandso's shade" as his pet? would 
be funny imo hehe.
