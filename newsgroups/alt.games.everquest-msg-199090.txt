The MOB density in there isn't too bad.

Simplest may be to root the guards, duck in, root any more that you see
(skimming around the inside edge of the fort walls). You can probably
reach the CC door before root starts running out.

If you have a cleric or chanter handy, they can use the Lull line to get
past them.

Or as others have suggested, just use invis.

Go inside, skim around to the other side of the fort, open the door in
the "hut" and click on the gem.

One other option: facing the front gate to the fort, turn right. You
will see a hill. Go to the hill, levitate, invis, face up, and you
can run over the wall. Use an overhead view to determine when you
actually cross the wall. (I would suggest you still invis as there are
still a couple of orcs to get past once you are inside.)

Personally I've used the Pacify and Levitate methods (the latter
using SoE). But haven't bothered invising as the orcs were already
green by the time I first looked into CC.
