No. The group requirement is 4. And the level requirement is +/- 7. With 
a 50th level, you could group with 5 43rds, and get a dungeone that 
would be aimed at 44th-45th level, and then have them all disband...and 
go solo.... but that's a far cry from a 20th level dungeon.

There is no way a level 50 could get into a dungeon created for a group 
of 20's.
