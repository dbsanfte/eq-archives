Almost as much mana as casting a group cheal?  This is a completly garbage
spell

And the hammer.. please.  Why not just let them summon their epic.  Let
mages summon 9/10 500dd lure weapons for their pets.. let druids summon 1000
mana for a spell cost of 20.  No.. even that wouldnt satisfy the whiners
