There's a couple of radio talk show hosts in my area that would agree with
you.

At what age is it NOT ok to try someone as an adult?  Fourteen?  Twelve?
Five?  Two?

And, if you're for the death penalty (I am, of adults), what's YOUR opinion
as the youngest possible "adult" age to get fried?

I think it's awfully easy for old farts to forget what it's like to be 16
and how immature and stupid they are.  Smart enough to know right from
wrong, but not smart or mature enough to ask the question BEFORE they do the
action.

But I've been called a bleeding heart liberal plenty of times, one more
won't hurt me any. :)
