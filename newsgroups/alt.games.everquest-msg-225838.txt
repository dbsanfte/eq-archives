No?  Malxxx is less hate than whatever the puller used to aggro the
mob, less hate than Tash, less hate than HoS, less hate than anything
you can think of no matter which class is casting it, less hate than
ONE arrow.

Faned:

'MaloX seems to have about ten times the aggro for shamans as it does
formagicians.'

Ok, this is horseshit as per several Mages and Shaman here.  Clear
enough now?  Both classes see the same amount of hate with their
respective debuff spells - hardly anything.

Faned:

'That could be pure perception, though, as shaman malo...'

Exactly.  Slow or resisted slow gets me killed.  Cripple gets me
killed.  Which you alluded to.  Had you said Tashxxx over Malxxx you
MIGHT have had a point.
