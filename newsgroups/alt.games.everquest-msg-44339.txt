First off, I must commend you on your post.  You're obviously intelligent.
You're asking good questions.  Most of the time I hear "what race/class"
should I be...like I'm a psychic and can figure out what they'd enjoy. :)

Don't join a Zek (PvP) server.  Don't turn in the Tome of Somethingorother
you get on your new character.  In fact, destroy it every time it shows up
(when you die the first few levels). It looks like a red book.

EQ gives you the option to be PvP but it's very poorly written...the game
was designed to be COOPERATIVE, and they've done a very good job of it.
It's entirely possible to go through 2.5 years (and counting) without being
purposely killed by another player on the PvE servers...and unless you're
dueling (temporary PvP) a player cannot intentionally kill you without
breaking the rules.

Newbies:  EVERYONE that I've talked to in game LOVES true newbies.  They
make the game new again for the many very nice folks who love to answer
their questions or do drive-by buffing (beneficial spells).

However, NO ONE likes a newbie who begs shit off other players.  DO NOT ask
for gear.  DO NOT ask for money.  DO NOT ask for buffs (unless you're
grouped).  Beggars are SLIME.

Be nice & polite.  I think that if you are you'll be surprised at the number
of items OFFERED to you (there's no reason to refuse them...lots of us like
to reward good behavior).
