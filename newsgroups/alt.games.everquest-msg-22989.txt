Using SoftIce isn't hacking, Im not endorsing it at all neither do i know
anyhting about it but i do know anybody can download and run this particular
utility and this does not constitute 'hacking'.
To the original poster whose question, I think i translated to be "Can it be
done and why would somebody want to?" It can probably be done which im sure can
be a disconcerting thought for all you whose credit card details are stored
somewhere on Verants systems, myself included. I was a bit hesitant about that
issue when signing up but you either accept that and play or you dont. As to
why somebody would want to hack EQ i can only imagine the mindset behind such
an act would be "Can it be done?" rather than any unscroupulous desire to rip
off credit cards because there are much richer pickings for that sort of thing
than EQ accounts. It's not something that keeps me up at night and i have faith
in Verants no doubt strict secruity regarding these matters.
