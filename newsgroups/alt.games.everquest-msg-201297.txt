I knew I should have addressed this is my original post. =P  I love EQ
played for over 2 years and will NEVER give away my stuff because i need my
fix of crack every now and again.  Just want to know if anything major
changed these past 5 months as I have been away from EQ and the msg boards.

Although I will be playing SWG when it eventually releases, I plan to get
right back on EQ2 when its available and I want to be able to take advantage
of some of the "loyal EQ player" quests that will be available.

Also, I bought LoY but never ventured there.  Is their hunting for higher
level toons?  I haven't even been back to EQ Atlas, hope Muse had a change
of heart :)

Beside, my stuff is crap anyway  : o
