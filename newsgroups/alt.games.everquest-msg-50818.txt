No really what does it matter ?
You have not bought that sword as an investment.
When it comes time to get a new sword that is apreciably better the one
you are selling eith won't make up even a small fraction of the one you
are buying or the one you are buying will have come down in price too.

The only people that I can see the scued EQ market makes a difference to
is Tradeskillers, who at one point had at least a hope in hell of making
some money back, and now don't (Generaly I am aware that there are
exceptions).
