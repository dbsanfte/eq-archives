I'll answer to this one, as a United States sailor.  I agree that the attack
on the Liberty should have been considered an act of aggression.  I've read
the reports and find them to be .... questionable.  How the Liberty could be
confused for a boat with a quarter of the displacement, while she was flying
the U.S. flag is not even a matter of discussion.  The Isreali military
is -extremely- competent.  The simply don't make mistakes like that.  I also
understand the reason they did so (and no, it's not a good reason, and it
damn well doesn't justify what they did).

None the less, we did not take action.  That was LBJ's decision (and
coverup, but that's another matter).  A third of a century has passed since
then, and Isreal has been a good ally.  It's too late to declare war for
something that happended thirty five years ago.  The chance to do the right
thing is gone, and all we can do now is try to do the right thing now, given
present circumstances.  However, I do think it's time for Isreal to come
clean, we all know the truth.

I wonder if they'll be saying the same thing about the Cole in thirty
years....
