In a similar way I convinced one of my power gaming friends to leave
one of his characters at my level ;)

Iksar are almost certainly the best monk as long as you can cope with
the heavy XP penalty and the atrocious faction. I'm a barbarian shaman
which helps in that at least one of us has decent faction to begin with.

Iksar shaman use different armor, although I believe it's roughly as
good. They can't use the Jaundiced Bone Bracer which some regard as
one of the ultimate solo items. Troll shaman's have the advantage of
going for a snare knecklace (Regent symbol of Innoruuk) which would
be very helpful, although it's a pretty weak snare.

But personally making a decision based on one or two items sucks. And
the hunting in Kunark is superb. So duel iksar has a lot to recommend
it.
