Just logged into Everquest after about a month away
and went to travel. I am bound above the firepot room
and when I levitated down, I noticed a high level PC
beating on an invincible skeleton. Named something
like "a tortured traveler" watched her beat on it for
half an hour, striking BIG blows against it, and its health
bar never even budged. It never returned the attack, but
when I clicked on it, It gave a long message warning of
the impending return of the Water Dragon. Is it just me,
or does it seem suspicious that the Water Dragon's return
coincides with the new expansion. You know, the one
that is rumored to have a travel system between every city.
But wait! Isn't that what the firepot room does? (at least
between most of them) Hmmm, a ploy to take that room
from us and force us to buy the Planes expansion? Could
it be that Sony and Verant are trying to force it down our
throats if we want the "new and easier" travel. Or am I just
a paranoid schizo with delusions of spiders taking over my
bagel francise? hehehe Ahh well. back to watching another
48 hour X-files marathon while playing Deus Ex and listening
to Conspiracy Theory. Hope I don't run out of Jolt cola and
Water Joe.
