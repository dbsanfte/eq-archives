That's basically how ours is, too.  Interestingly, we get more low-
levels leaving than high levels.  Of course, the low levels are the ones 
that get pissy when we won't hold their hands and change their diapers, 
and storm out in a huff (had one like that last night actually - got 
nasty in guild chat, then started sending nasty personal tells and got 
himself /guildremoved by one of the officers instead of quitting as he 
claimed he was about to), while the high level ones are the ones that 
keep trying to get groups together, maybe form a raid or two, then 
quietly give up and rather unhappily find another guild in order that 
they might actually progress. :/
