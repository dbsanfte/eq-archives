Hehe... Sod levelling, I play EQ for the sheer catwalk value. =) So far I 
have the outfit we have discussed on Hanrahan... Parsifal is wearing full 
lambent, but with a bare head (helms look terrible on humans) and dual 
claws (Icetooth and Eitchatka).

My baby necro has made it back safely from Thurgadin, and I have presented 
him with a Robe of Enshroudment (matte black) and Shadowed boots and gloves 
(likewise). The fly on the ointment is the rather camp Water Crystal Staff. 
I wonder if there is any kind of Necro weapon with a black graphic...
