Yes, it went "live"  on Test Server last night.  Players who had
logged on to test in the weeks before Feb 3 were invited to the
"External Beta" as they call it.   Jumping on test NOW won't get you
into the beta, just a warning to anyone who wants to try =)

I've heard it's the full expansion, so I assume that the cartography
system is included....  BUT all testers had to agree to an NDA so you
might not be getting any specifics.
