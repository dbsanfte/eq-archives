I agree that it's necessary for mobs to have some situations in which
they'll ignore a nearby target and try for a different one (such as the
healer or nuker or whatever), or the game is lame.  And I agree its
perfectly legitimate for players to construct tactics that take
advantage of the predictable behavior of mobs.

I also agree it would be more... interesting? challenging? realistic?
if mobs didn't do really stupid things like chase a nearly uncatchable
PC forever while other PCs pound him from behind.  Putting in a timer
would help, but frankly, there's already a sort of timer for this: as
the guys pounding on the mob accumulate more damage, they'll tend to
drift to the top of his hate list.  The kiter has to continue to draw
agro to keep the mob chasing him.  Not having done this a lot, I don't
know how hard that is; if it's too easy, it could just mean that
certain spells or discs generate too much agro?

I could see adding a timer to the mix, by saying that agro "decays"
over time, i.e. if you did something really really annoying to the mob
30 seconds ago, that's might not be enough to keep the mob's attention
if someone is being moderately annoying right now (e.g. by whacking it
on the butt).

Of course, if SOE made such a change, I'll bet a lot of players would
be ticked that the tactics they've practiced and fine-tuned, learning
exactly how much they need to do to maintain (or avoid) agro, would
all be thrown out the window...
