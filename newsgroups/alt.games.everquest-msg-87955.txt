There, there... I've destroyed plenty whiskers. And sold beards.

What is trivial for acrylia studs and boning? My smithing is 110,
which I find sufficient for most things (I was going to work it
higher, but since I now have a high elf future grandmaster smith...)

I'm also 21 JC and fletching (trained only), 170 brewing, 143 baking,
124 tailoring and 107 fishing.

Dull as hell. Have dynamic lights on and look for glowing young
shardwurms at night.
