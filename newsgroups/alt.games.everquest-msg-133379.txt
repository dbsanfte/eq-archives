I've searched Allakazams on ways to raise the Arcaine Scientist's faction, but it
seems there is no way to to this unless you aren't already KOS to them.  Well, the
Rat ear pie quest in QH from Rephas seems promising, if rat ears could be found in
quantity, but I have a feeling that he's refuse to help out an Ogre like Lenny. 
Lenny is dubious to the Knights of Truth, and we can raise this as high as necessary
if need be.  For what it's worth, Lenny is agnostic.  Any ideas?

Annie <--- Crossing her fingers and hoping that someone will pull though some good
news for her.

My main on Firiona Vie:

By the side of Lenny, the Traveling Ogre Warrior.
Members of the Council of Mithril Dreams.
Teapray Oogrog  -- High Elf Cleric, 27, everyday is a new adventure!

Several others played on Drinal, highest is a level 30 Ranger.
