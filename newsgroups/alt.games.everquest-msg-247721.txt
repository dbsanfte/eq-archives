I would tend to disagree with this, provided that you ahve either a Tolans
bracer, or that arrow summoning bag from MMC adventures.  I use Root - n -
shoot to soften targets up when Im soloing my ranger. At 51 the damage done
with a Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt is not insignificant with an Archery
skill of, currently, 202.

On a related note, I started seeing a strange message when using archery
after I dinged 51. I see, quite frequently, a message stating "Your Arrow
did Double damage!".   Usually its a modestly higher damage shot ( Say a
good crit ) occasionally though Ive seen shots in the 190 - 210 range! Those
have been few and far between, but have been most welcome to see :)
Anyways...does anyone know whats actually happening ? Is this just some sort
of intrinsic range ability and Ive just started to see it happen since I hit
level 51 ?

Any info is appreciated!
