Yeah... I finally got my WG bracer last night, after 3 months of fucking
around with faction for the guy MQing it for me. Yay for 4 backpacks full of
giant helms.  Oh, and 2516 hp self buffed. /duck /run

I personally think the green armor looks like poo, and like having full
(well near full, coldain gloves aren't and WG headband isn't, but that's ok
because chain helms look fugly) chain look.

However, in response to your question, for green legs.  Tunarean Soldier
Leggings (BD cultural tailoring, verdant green leather), Rowyl's Greaves of
Nature (thurg quest, green leather), Elder Spiritist legs (kunark armor,
from Venril, green chain), and the utterly craptastic Soft Wicker legs (from
warrens/stonebrunt, green leather, utter poo for stats)
