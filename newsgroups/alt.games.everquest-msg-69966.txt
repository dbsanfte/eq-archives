Well, I must say I like them. Being a caster and robes are what I wear, it's
amazing how good they look compared to the old models. Even the plain
looking Crystalline Robes with the old models are now a lot more extravagant
and worth wearing for looks.

The only thing that really struck me as odd was most of the armor on
Iksar's. It looks like all of them have big flat female breasts or
something.

Also, the barbarian pose with his hands on his thighs makes their weapons go
through their bodies. VI should really fix that one.
