    Without the purpose of the server, it sounds stupid. Once you hear the
purpose, it makes more sense.

    You get points for killing people. At the end of one month, the person
with the most points gets an item named after them and the server is reset.
So you need to balance ganking folks with levelling, since the entire point
is ganking folks. Hopefully there aren't any rules loopholes that will allow
someone to keep killing a friend or something like that.
