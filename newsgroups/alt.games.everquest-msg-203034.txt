<<<<<<I have, multiple times.  Your only response is to stick out your tongue,
hurl a few insults, and go "Nuh-uhhhh", after which you declare yourself the
winner (of what, I'm not exactly sure, but I'm sure it makes you feel
better).

Which, as I think about it, makes you sound a lot like my four year old when
he loses an argument to my seven year old.

Crash>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I must have missed where you explained your side of the argument so please take
the time to retype it here so you can finally get rid of me.  Or you can just
go back and cut and paste it since you've stated it so many times.  That ought
to be easy enough.  Do everyone a favor and make your point so I can finally be
shut up.
