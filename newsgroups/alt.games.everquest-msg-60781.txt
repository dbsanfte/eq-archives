Sigh. I feared that you would not be capable of completing the
exercise.

This is largely an anonymous forum, and therefore all such claims are
unverifiable. Hence, they are irrelevant, because effectively they are
nothing more than cheap bravado. Doubly so when one's own alleged
'credentials' are used for no other purpose than to attack someone
else.

>A news group is a free flow of expression (or whatever...) from all

Yes, and the contributors are judged on the quality of their
contributions, not by what unverifiable credentials they claim. 

>Thus, a person's educational background is every bit relevant,

"I'd put my masters degree up against biz's lack of education anyday."

Right. That's relevant in a gaming newsgroup. Sure.

>The fact you (probably) lack any significant educational acheivement 
>is likely the reason you find education so irrelevant.

And there you go again. 

>Do I threaten you that much you need some assurance you have a victory?

Threaten?!?! No, to be threatening you must at least possess some
credibility. The only credible threat you could currently make would
be to continue to post idiotic messages here, and that's a threat
which is easily countered.

>And second, you're just becoming annoying now.  For the last few days, I had
>fun toying with you

Right. Being shown as a complete liar and idiot is "toying".

>And it's getting annoying now.

Yeah, I imagine it would be annoying to be shown to be an utter moron
over and over again.

>This newsgroup has been your life for the last two-and-a-half years.

No, this newsgroup has been an entertainment. 

>here you STILL are -- flailing your usual self-righteous and 
>ignorant attitude.

Self righteous? Sure, if by that you mean that I don't suffer fools
gladly.

As for ignorant, which one of us was it that was making the false
claims in the DAoC newsgroup?

>Don't you think it's time you moved on?  Maybe do something with 
>your life?

Like get a better job, buy a house, finish several large software
systems for clients, learn new technical skills, and find religion?
That kind of "do something"?

I've done all that. None of it is verifiable, of course, so it's
irrelevant. But it's not as irrelevant as this tired old "get a life"
attack you though you'd be clever and haul out. Don't you think it's
time you moved on? Maybe find a new insult to hurl?
