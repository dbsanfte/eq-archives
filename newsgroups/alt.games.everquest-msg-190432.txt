I've seen a few that have made it through the trial of execution in PoJ 
(after
many painful, death filled attempts. So it can be done. That will get 
you into PoV and PoS.  As for any other flags... yeah. You can pretty 
much forget it unless you find a *really* nice guild letting strangers 
tag along to hail for other flags. You won't be getting them on your own 
or in pickup groups.
