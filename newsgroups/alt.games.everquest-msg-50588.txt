not sure what u mean by spawn scheme but here is what i know ( or think i
know) he FOR SURE spawns under the Elite gnoll ledge in the center of those
barrels his place holders are the 3 gnolls that spawn there and maybe the
elites above. ive killed him 3 times and everytime he has had the barrel.
level 24 you may as well kill everything you see for qeynos faction. the
gnoll fangs for Halas faction and those stacking pelts to work up tailoring
and make your selft a cloak (need 64 assuming no fails)
have fun \)
