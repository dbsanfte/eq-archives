Sorry, you are forgetting the "omnipotent" bit that goes on top of 
"omniscient". God not only knows what you are going to do, but knows that 
you are going to do it because he *has* created you to do it. God *chose* to 
create you in such a way that you would act in a way that displeases him 
(and has already been displeasing him for all eternity, in fact, since he 
has known since forever what you would do once he got around to create 
you...).

You can't get away from it; omniscience necessarily implies determinism.
