So I've returned to the game after a couple of months off (I've had a
new-ish job and a part in a local community theater production that
have kept me busy), and I'm having trouble getting back into it. My
main character is a level 35 druid. The problem is that he's been a
level 35 druid for an ice age or so now. I want to push on so I can
start experiencing some of the higher-level content. The game's
starting to bore me, though--I log on for a few minutes, think "Oh,
god...not The Overthere (or Eastern Wastes, or Dreadlands, etc.)
again", and log off.

What can I do? I've deleted some of the alts I didn't play all that
much so I can focus on my main, and I just got Planes of Power for
easier travel, but I don't know where to go to get over my
ZoneBoredom(tm). What's a place that's off the beaten path that's
interesting and provides decent experience? I'd prefer a place that
offers possibilities for grouping, but I'll solo if I have to.

(Yeah, I know...grouping druid. What can I say? Soloing bores me to
tears a lot of the time. I like the interaction in a good group.)
