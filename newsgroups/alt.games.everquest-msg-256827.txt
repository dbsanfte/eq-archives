Hey folks,

I was wondering if anyone had seen something.  I was browsing around
Allakhazam and even though I've done it, I decided I'd pull up the rogue
epic for kicks.  I noticed something I haven't been able to find information
about.  Allakhazam mentions item lore of the Tainter of Souls.  Anyone know
anything about this?

Thanks.
