The problem is, some people just don't know how to admit they made a
mistake, and say "Sorry, my goof.  I should have looked into this
before I replied".  Instead they go to all kinds of effort to try and
twist there way out of it.  I guess maybe they are afraid they will
look foolish if they admit they  made a mistake, not realizing they
look even more foolish trying to twist their way out of it and not
take responsibility.  What's the big deal, everyone makes mistakes,
there is much more honor in standing up and admitting it when you do.

I was going to reply to him and say something like, "Oh, you are
probably one of those who doesn't believe man ever walked on the moon.
You know you can't believe what the newspapers and tv say".  Then I
decided no.  I do my best to stay out of this trivial and immature BS.
It is such a waste of time.  The sad thing is, is that there is such a
disproportionate amount of it on this NG.  I do find good nuggets of
information here, but you have to wade through so much BS, between all
the attempts at one-ups-menship (no idea how to spell that), insults,
and the constant feeding of the new trolls that have shown up.
