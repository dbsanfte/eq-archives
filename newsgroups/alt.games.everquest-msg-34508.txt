I've not been asked to pay for a port in months, but then again I
rarely ask for one from anyone not in my group... and it would
be hard to find a porter I'd not resed three or four times by now.

I do find "looking for port or push to DL" (or whereever)gets a
response quite rapidly these days.

A cleric, poor?  Its hard to imagine.  Taking money only
from those who won't take "happy to do it, no pay needed"
for an answer I still pull in an average of a hundred pp an
hour resing.  When I decided I wanted to give up on the
whole AC mess and buy TBoots, I did nothing -but- res
(and shut up about no pay needed... I'd say "whatever you
like" instead) for two days and had 6Kpp ready to go.

Ignoring the whole res thing, I group with people ten levels
higher than me more often than not (well, not since I hit
51, of course, but you see what I mean) and therefore am
getting my cut of a substantially better value loot than
most people my level.  Since the low teens, I've had a
better income than most of my friends, and my expenses
are only twice what theirs are (plate and spells)
