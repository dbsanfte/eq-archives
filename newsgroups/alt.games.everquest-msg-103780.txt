I was wondering what classes are the most wanted/needed in Everquest at
different levels. (in grouping/raiding terms, not soloing) ?

I have been playing a Druid as my first char, and found him very easy to
find a group at the teenage levels, but at my current level (29) I can see
a pattern that this "multi purpose" class is not as needed as the
"specialists".
I kinda stopped playing my necromancer eventhough I liked the potential, as
I saw how almost impossible it was for necros to get a group in LOIO at
20'es
And I play the enchanter now, as I see their great potential in groups
throughout the levels. (plus its a fun caster class, crow control is just
so different from buff/heal/nuke)

My question/poll is thus:

If someone is to start a new char, what should it be if the goal was
grouping (my favorite part of EQ) at:

10-20
20-30
30-40
40-50
50+
Raids

I can only fill in the first ones, as I have no higherlevel knowledge

10-20
- There is a need for everyone. Bards shine in groups
20-30
- Anything goes, Enchanters and warriors always needed
- Necro and Rangers never get the invite
- Mages neither (why I cant figure !)
30-40
- Clerics, Warriors and Enchanters are first pick. Wizards come close
- Druids are now surplus, but can get a place if no Cleric or Shaman or for
  porting issues
- Rouges as damage dealers are requested
40-50
50+
Raids

The hybrids (SK, Ranger, Paladin) are difficult to place, as they are not
that common, but I think the suffer a bit in the grouping picks to the
specialists, although SK seems to be more requested than Necromancers.

Interested in your comments.
