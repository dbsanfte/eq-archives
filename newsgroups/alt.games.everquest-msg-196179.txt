Aha, thats the sort of tip I'm looking for.  I've discounted the low level
versions of this line since stats don't generally make much difference, but
here's a situation where the side effect might be perfect under some
circumstances.  If they are a high taunt, then their questionable effect on
combat is of very little importance.  And they don't break root, so I can slap
em on in one of my "soften it up" pulls where I root, slow, and DOT till the
mob comes; put debuff in before starting DOTs to make them even madder at me.
