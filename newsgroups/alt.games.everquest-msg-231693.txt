None are coming to mind.  My suggestion would be to go over to
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/ and do a spell search for regeneration.  If you
click on each of the regeneration efftects there will be a listing of all
the items with that amount of regeneration.  You can look through them and
find out which ones are droppable.  I think you have a pretty good
collection as it is.  Right now you are using call of bones, 16 hp for 8
mana, and I cant imagine that you are seeing much of a dip in your hp
totals.  I recently went from 0 worn regen to 8 and I can tell a diffrence
when using Seduction of Saryrn, 63hp for 50mana.

Good Luck!  May all your regeneration dreams come true.
