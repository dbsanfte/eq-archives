In article <2bj3h2-1j3.ln1@hydra.dagon.net>, dagon@dagon.net says...

I -can- imagine it.

Remember this:

"Another of our goals is to broaden the core grouping roles to allow all 
classes to more easily put together groups.  Similar to how any of the 3 
main tanks should be able to perform that role in a group, we want any 
of the 3 healers to be able to perform the role of a main healer in a 
group."

EQ2 has 3 healers that are virtually interchangable and 3 tanks that are 
virtually interchangable. Everything about this patch message, combined 
with the the fact that they did this in EQ2 suggests to me that EQ1 is 
getting an EQ2 make over.
