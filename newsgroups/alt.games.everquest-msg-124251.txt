    My server's clerics finally said "enough!" and created an informal list.
If you go to the spawn, talk to the person there, and help them camp
Ragefire (covering for them when they have to sleep, etc.) you're on the
list. If you don't, and try and get your guild to steamroll, you've just hit
the shit list of my guild, the other big guild, and at least half a dozen
mid-level guilds that all have been helping Ragefire campers. One mid-level
guild was making noises like they wanted to steamroll, but once they
realized it was our guildleader's second account cleric sitting out there
patiently waiting her turn they backed down ASAP.
