Ok, that makes sense... I though Celaeno was saying her SK worshiped
Erollisi... in which case, I was going to start a SK immediatly, as the only
thing stopping me was that I'm not fond of the dark gods.  Of course, her
censure of Lanys kind of threw me off, since she's Innoruk's daughter.

Order of the Mallet

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
