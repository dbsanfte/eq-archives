When my cleric was 11th, I found that to be about the peak of my soloing
career.  Early on, the magic+weapons+armor makes clerics fairly good soloers
from levels 2-12.

After level 14, the (non-undead) blue mobs start getting too tough for your
combat abilities, and your regular DD spells are too slow and
mana-inefficient to handle combat...at least until you get Holy Might at
level 19 (30pt DD + Stun...allows you to cast your other DD spells).

Also, at 11th, any cleric I've played has been too broke at that level to be
able to afford SoW potions (unless I've sold a lot of CB belts).
