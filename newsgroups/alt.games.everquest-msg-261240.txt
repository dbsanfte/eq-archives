Is there a particular reason so many people are taking the "get my butt to 
70 as fast as humanly possible" approach as soon as they register the 
expansion? Is it because it will make the encounters they are currently 
tackling easier, or are they in a super hurry to get to the bleeding edge 
content? Little of both, probably?

I can certainly see where the ability to level up after being stuck at 
65.999 for so long would be appealing. I just don't know why there would be 
such a rush. I *hate* grinding xp. Levelling up is great, and yes, it's one 
of the carrots that keeps me going, but I don't have too much trouble being 
satisfied with doing so in the normal course of the game.

Gratz to all of you on your recent dings, though. They've been a long time 
coming.
