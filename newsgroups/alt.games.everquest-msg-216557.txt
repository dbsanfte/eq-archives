The paperclipping bug was mentioned in the *next* patch- pathing was *not* 
mentioned in the previous patch.

Let's not forget Monk ID heaven, MR in Velks. If you feared a mob there, 
they would go into a loop, and a small enough one that you could be hitting 
them the whole time by standing at the midpoint and panning back and forth.

Pulling at 20m is needlessly risky.

If you can survive, with a decent pull rate, success in LDON is virtually 
guaranteed(aside from collections, and I think everyone by now knows those 
are more chance than skill).

The CLERIC should be setting the pace. The monk just pulls according to 
that pace.

When the cleric says "20m- hold pulls", do you pull anyway?

"body language"?

You cast your CHs so they land when the tank is above 25%?

The point is it takes a fuckload more mana/minute to heal the ranger or 
rogue. I don't have that mana because you have denied it to me.

Your 20m cleric doesn't have the ability to revirtue either.

Yes, I do.

I disband people like you and put them on the "Never again" list.

OK, say the mob is 100% resistant, my point stands. When his buddies come 
to whack on you, your cleric or chanter is still at 20m.

No, it's not. It's like saying that, situationally, a ranger with 
Weaponshield up can tank better than anyone in the group.

Explain to me what the difference between a "good" and "bad" cleric is when 
they are both at 20m and the party is mid-battle.

What attitude is this that gives me less mana than other clerics?

The point here is that for *sustained* pulling, you will not be getting any 
more mobs per hour pulling at 20m than you would pulling at 40m, aside from 
the one initial mob that takes you from 40m to 20m. So, instead of leaving 
yourself breathing room and taking that one extra mob when the situation 
demands it, you use your safety net frivolously.

Look, it's the "I'm right cuz I say so! Nyah!" tactic.
