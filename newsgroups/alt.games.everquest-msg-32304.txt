Actually you need to read up on the law more and I'd suggest you go
back to school for an elementary reading comprehension course. The
article you point to has absolutely nothing to do with verant banning
for things on their own message board. The article just states that a
judge or judges refused to force a web service or services from
revealing the names of anonymous posters who posted in a critical
manner which seemed to be "in the know" about a company or two (in
other words, trade secrets)

Meanwhile what you are talking about is verant banning you for
inflammatory messages on their OWN BOARD. This is a very different
thing. For example, if the parties above had gone to those companies
boards and posted under their own names then there would be no judge
making a ruling because the companies would have their names. That is
more compareable to what you did. You broke the age old rule of don't
take a crap where you live.

Nope, its not illegal at all. Start up a web board and let me post
something you don't like on it, then ban me. See if I have any legal
case against you. Guess what? I won't.

Now, if you posted some ANONYMOUS postings which were critical of
verant say in this newsgroup, and verant was trying to get your ISP to
reveal you name so they could ban you THEN it would be compareable. 

What you have offered instead is a CONTRAST, which is the complete
OPPOSITE, while you meant to make a valid COMPARISON which you FAILED
at.

I have some apples over here and some oranges over there.
