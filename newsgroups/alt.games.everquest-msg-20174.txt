I did this quest at 31, and did not die a single time.

I came close... real close... in LGuk when I let a Guildie help me, and he
rabbited on me.

The ultimate advice I have for doing this quest is:
Invis invis invis... and pretend you're a rogue.

In my experience, the Gobbies in Rathe and Oasis do not see invis.  However,
an "apprentice" of mine tells me that they did see her.  So, that may have
something to do with approach angle, and/or the presence of Gobbie Shaman.

My approach path, and my suggestion for these two towers is "think Tom
Cruise."  The towers have open skylights, and the rod piece is on the top
floor.  Cue the hero music, and swim straight down, between the Gobbies,
grab the rod end ... [PgUp] full up, and swim straight up.

You will need an enduring breath for the Rathe one, as the tower is in the
middle of an underwater tunnel running most of the length of the lake.  The
entrance to the tunnel that I used is underwater on the west face of the
aviak island... it's long, but a straight tunnel, and keeping your eyes
open, you won't miss the tower.

LGuk: I never saw the hand, but I got an invis vs undead from a passing sk,
I think (do sk's get that spell?), upon entering the zone.  With a good map
I headed straight for the room.  Once you know that invis vs undead takes...
don't hesitate (but have gate ready).

As I said, I did not see the hand, so I can't verify the claim someone made
that it is alive (and thus sees invis vs undead) however that does not seem
likely to me, as it is an essentially undead thing (though it wouldn't be
the first time VI decided to make an invis useless).  Once I got this piece,
I didn't bother trying to find my way out... GATE!

Free Advice: Cast identify on each and every rod piece, and make sure they
are what you think they are before putting them in the box.
