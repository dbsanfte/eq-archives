The outside buffing issue is solved in EQ2, seperate from the locked 
encounters really.  You must be grouped with someone for their buffs to 
stick.  I still play EQ2, mostly because friends do, not because I think 
it's better than EQ1.  I dislike the encounter locking personally, I 
dislike the inability to help others with something as simple as a heal 
or rez.  I am not thrilled with the tradeskill system.  Basically, if I 
were not playing with friends, I'd close my EQ2 account, and who knows, I 
may yet do that, as I also play EQ1 with friends.
