I would say that's sort of true. With a revolver or pump shotgun etc. you
need to reload after a few shots. You can fire pretty fast, but ammo runs
out fast as well. A (semi-) automatic usually has a clip with quite a lot of
bullets and clips are easily replaceable. If you're in a deathfrenzy I would
say an automatic is WAY more dangerous then a revolver.
