Well, I'm not going back there, so it's kinda a moot 
point, but the lag was so bad when I tried even 
*middling* with the clipping, I'd have to run 10 
seconds, stop 30 seconds, run 10 seconds, stop 30 
seconds.

I'm DEFINITELY getting a new graphics card before 
Shadows of Luclin, so hopefully this won't be a problem 
if I ever decide to go back at a higher level.

Maybe they just don't like shamen ;)
