You did fine. The real "mistake" was made by the Wizard. He should
have had an Evac spell loaded and ready.

When the crap hits the fan you want to keep the Cleric alive for the
recovery. Don't be afraid to bail. As the main healer it will be your
job to call the "evac". You know how much mana you have, and how long
you can keep the other party members alive. If you have an
enchanter/bard for crowd control, the duty of calling evac generally
goes to them.
