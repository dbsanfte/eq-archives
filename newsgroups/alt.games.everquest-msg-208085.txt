Ok, so Whirl would have use as a short duration "mez" for dotted mobs,
assuming all the melees and pets have already directed their attention
elsewhere (possibly a very dangerous assumption).  But as an interrupt,
wouldn't the baby Mez (Mezmerization) be better with its much lower
Mana cost, at least in those cases where you don't have pets on the
target?  Also, in your example above, why are you not mezzing the
priest-class mob?  Does Whirl stick to higher level mobs than your
mez?  or is the mob stunnable but not mezzable?   Or does the mob have
a double-secret resist bonus vs. mez?  Heh, enough questions, hope you
answer some at least.  I've never played an Enchanter past 17 or so,
which leaves me curious as to the details of higher level play.  I've
seen them played skillfully at high levels of course, but that doesn't
mean I've been aware of anywhere near all that they're doing.
