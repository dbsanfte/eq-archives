I want second the first poster's advice.

Beg for advice or information.  In the long run, you will end up a lot
better off.  So next time someone begs, I think I will respond with something
like, "I will not give you material posessions, but I will offer advice, answer
questions, show you around, if you like.  Are you interested?"  If they
answer negatively, I can be assured that they are probably alts with
higher level characters trying to get good stuff by looking poor (and probably
female).

Earlier, I was thinking that a good response to a beggar who says something 
like, "u hv nethin for a lvl 1 war?"  would be "Go fish.  Do you have
anything for a level 37 bard?"  Perhaps it would be a better answer
if you had no time, or highly suspected the beggar to be an alt.

Just my 2cp
