THey guarantee to keep the character for at leat 3 months...I know people
who have canelled for up to 6 and still had characters there....otehrs on
this group have reported that they have delete dno characters since the
start.

Sell kit or hand it to guildmates if you think you would either enjoy
getting it again or if you would easily get some more....otherwise it
seems good odds so far to just stop the account billing.
