Something most people are forgeting when testing these new changes is
experience. No i don't mean that bar - i mean the person behind the keyboard.

These changes are designed to attract new players to the game and get them
(dare i say) addicted to it.

I'm guessing that you know your way around the newbie zones and starting
cities, and therefore aren't seeing them for the first time.

A true newbie is going to take a lot longer than you to figure out the lay of
the land, the interface, what to hunt, where to hunt it etc.

Okay admittedly they're not going to have such a hard (if lvl1-10 can ever be
called that) time like the rest of us did as rank newbies.

I do see a down side however your skills tend to lag behind what they
previously would (you put 12 pts in 1hs - a true newbie would'nt know to do
this) and when they hit lvl11 they're going to have a rude awakening to cr's
though they are better equipped to deal with it for first timers - eg larger hp
to get back to your corpse and longer (full 7 days) decay time.

The point is that those of us that have been playing for 6+ months cannot
really be regarded as true newb's and are ill-equipped to test the new changes.

Now if we can get a rank newbie to try what you did ......

I'm guessing it'll still take a weekends play to get to 10.

Just my thoughts :)
