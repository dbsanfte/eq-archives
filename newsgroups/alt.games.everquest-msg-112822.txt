  They're easiest to handle in small groups since sometimes they spawn as
healers.  There's a 2 spawn in Nektulos, which is about as small a spawn as
you're going to find.  It's difficult to break their spawns where ever you
hunt them, because they respawn really quickly.  So if you don't think you
can handle more than 2 or 3 shadowed men at a time, I'd say go with the
Nektulos ones.  Otherwise hunt them elsewhere.

  As others have mentioned, they're not exactly rich.  They drop a few quest
items, coinage, essence of shadow for dark elf cultural armor, but nothing
that's really good to sell or use.
