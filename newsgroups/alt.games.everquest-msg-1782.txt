I find this interesting (the sequence in which you list them, that
is). I must confess that I'm something of an XP junkie... as are most
people I meet (although some see loot as more important).

Are you saying that you'd be happy to roleplay and hunt in areas where
all of the mobs are green?

Pretty normal procedure... unless the place you're hunting is
particularly renowned for phat lewt :)

I loathe alpha-looting with a passion. In my opinion, nothing detracts
more from any roleplaying encounters than trying to remember whose
turn it is to loot. It worked fine during the lower levels, but after
a while it got very boring very quickly. 

At levels 30+ (in my experience and on my server) alpha-looting is
virtually unknown. The norm tends to be honour-looting, roll on
anything good (which more than one person wants). Even that system has
it's flaws.... I'm always nervous of being seen to ninja-loot and end
up looting *less* than my fair share, just in case.... and feeling a
little resentful towards other players who are obviously not so
concerned about such things.

My favourite system is Master Looting (whereby one character is
designated the looter, usually due to available backpack space and/or
weight allowance). At the end of the session (or when a character has
to leave), the master looter splits the cash with the rest of the
group and (if there's anything worth winning) putting forward items to
be rolled on.

This is by far the best system IMO. It has its flaws in that the
master looter tends to get all of the runes/words/pages (small amount
of cash but it can soon add up), but this is a very minor issue when
you consider the benefits:-

Everyone receives an equal share of the cash.
Nobody is able to ninja-loot
Nobody need worry about loot, period. When loot doesn't get in the way
of the "hunt", things go a damned sight more smoothly :)

>So what do you think of this idea?

It sounds like a nice system which might save some arguments, but its
entering the realms of non-fantasy (i.e. having a computer decide
these things for you, which just wouldn't be available to you in a
fantasy environment). This, at least, would (I think) be Verant's
approach to the suggestion... and I for one would agree with them.

The whole loot thing is just another aspect of the game which we need
to learn to deal with. If too much becomes automated, there is less
required of the player, which means (from my point of view) less
interest in the interaction which takes place within the group.

10/10 for the idea though :)
