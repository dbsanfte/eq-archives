An annoying problem i have is any time on EQ my computer totally freezes up,
i tried everything, different soundcards, no on on-board sound, disabling
sound, changing screen res and details.

I have
Athlon 1000mhz
256mb
ISDN Modem line
Geforce 2 64MB

What could be the problem? Anyone else getting this?

When soloing i usually get killed when i enter the game again after
rebooting, because i was in middle of a fight when i froze.

The Geforce I have is a
Excalibur Geforce 2 MX200
Whats the latest driver people are using for this on Everquest?

thanks
Shirl
