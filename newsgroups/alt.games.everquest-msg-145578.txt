Run 1 is faster than almost every mob out there.  Not much
faster, I'll grant you.  But when you are running to zone,
the difference between slower than mobs and faster than
mobs is quite noticable... as in the difference between dead
and zoned out.

Run 2 and Run 3 improve on this to be sure, and Run 3 is
particularly nice in that its so reliably faster than mobs that
you no longer need TBoots... but the difference between
slightly faster than mobs and significantly faster than mobs
is zoned out or zoned out a little faster.  Nothing at all
like the difference between run 1 and no run AA at all.
