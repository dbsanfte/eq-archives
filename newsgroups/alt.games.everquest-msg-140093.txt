I figured im going to finally finish his leveling, so I may as well get him
properly geared up to make it as painless as possible.

Basically looking for any thoughts on item upgrades (especially from higher
level/main mages, as im sure they will take summoned focus items into
account more)

Also on what combination of weapons / shield / book for Primary and
Secondary.   I have a selection of weapons to chose from, so whats gonna be
most effective?

Heres the items I think are shittiest of all -
Crown : no clue..  the DD focus one from CT is ugly as hell, and I can get
the effect in a different slot right. So whats the best choice/s for this?

Earings : Im gonna get him an earing of the solstice at some point in the
near future.. so the other slot?

Neck: Hes currently wearing a different one.. but its equally crappy (4 int,
perma see invis, few other stats.. something like that)

Rings.. I figure 1 shadel bandit ring next time Im bored enough to go kill
them.. and for the other?

Cloak.. not sure.. heiro I guess if i see 1 for under 10k, but failing that,
what should I look for?

Belt.. hmm? nfc what to go for.

Range item.. hmm shrug

I dont want to spend a shitload of money, I don't want to do long ass camps
and factioning (ala chardok).. but I do have a 60monk/60cleric/60shaman to
get the stuff.

I won't be taking him to raids either, so nodrop raid stuff is ruled out
(other than loot on my guilds raids that would rot otherwise.. e.g a dain
crown rots 9 times in 10 for my guild)
