You still don't understand - beyond a certain point more people on
a project can actually slow down the development process.  Tasks 
can only be subdivided so far.  SOE and LucasArts can easily afford
to fully fund these 2 projects, as well as several others WITHOUT
adversely affecting the quality of the team/product.

It simply doesn't happen that a company that size has only
X amount of total resources (programmers, artists etc) to split 
among there projects - as you can see from many of the little
developer letters, many of these people were hired there specifically
for SWG
