Noone is suggesting that raids are impossible without /raid.  In fact, raid
has been used so little since release that its difficult to suggest the
feature is really all that interesting.

Unless you've tried it.

And are now forced to go back to the horse and buggy system after driving a
ferrari.

Raid is great, and its clear that some experience on the part of raid leaders
can make even better use of its potential, and some tweaking on the part of
Sony can make it even more functional.

Going back to raids without /raid is like putting Forest Gump back in his leg
braces.  Yes, you can still walk, but now you know what its like to run!

Your last sentence does not parse well.  I'm guessing you mean that you are
surprised that people who raid NTOV should have the money and will to spend to
buy PoP.  Well there are several problems with that idea.  One, real life
success does not correlate with EQ success, you may find both in the same
person, but there's no clear cause/effect relationship... unless a reverse
correlation comes in to play, where the people who spend the most time on EQ
must spend the least on RL!  Two, PoP is just plain not available yet to a
significant portion of the player base, anyone who doesn't live in the US
either has to go back channel or wait wait wait for the dubious shipping
system Sony decided to use, plus the random actions of various countries'
customs officials and then the arcane distribution systems of their various
retail outlets.  In some cases you'll be lucky to find PoP for sale before
Thanksgiving (which is a US holiday anyway)
