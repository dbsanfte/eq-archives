Personally if there's an enchie in the group, I'll count on *them* to 
get an add off the cleric.  Compare:

MT attacks.  Everyone assists.  Add happens and starts to beat up 
cleric.  Enchie mezzes.  First mob dies, MT turns and finishes off add 
along with the rest of the damage-doers.

vs

MT attacks.  Everyone assists.  Add happens and starts to beat up 
cleric.  Enchie starts to mez.  MT turns to take add off cleric because 
cleric panicked and started mashing the "GET IT OFF ME" key several 
times in a row, flooding the chat screen and making sure we knew who was 
the most important person there (me, annoyed?).  Another damage-doer 
notices and assists tank.  The other(s) continue to beat on the first 
pull.  Enchie tries to mez MT mob but it keeps getting hit.  Enchie 
tries to mez original mob but it keeps getting hit.  Enchie yells at 
people to stop hitting mob.  One damage doer from each team decides they 
were wrong to move and one switches back to the original mob while the 
other switches to the one the MT is on.

...

Get the point? :p  IF your enchie doesn't do his job, move in and get 
that mob off your cleric's butt, then point out to the enchie that it's 
to his benefit to make sure the cleric doesn't die.  If your enchie 
*does* do his job, then the first solution is a heck of a lot simpler.  
Personally, I've grouped with MTs that like to switch fights mid-battle, 
and it drives me *insane* because I'll be happily backstabbing one of 
three mobs when all of a sudden it'll turn around and start smacking me, 
hard.  I can /assist the MT again but meanwhile, I've got a big mean 
thing on me and I'm a rogue.  I can't tank worth shit (well okay now I 
can, thank you AGAIN, bazaar zone...).

Erg, babbling, I'm too tired to make much sense.  But really.  it's SO 
much easier for an enchie to do their job when everybody sticks to one 
fight at a time.
