I can solo quit effectively naked and weaponless. Gear is nice, but not
the definining characteristic of the class.

I took two chars into the EK event. A druid and an enchanter. My druid
made out like a bandit. SOW+Track meant I had a fair chance at just about
anything that dropped that I could use and was /loc'd via occ.

And? Your point? They have to stand toe-to-toe with the mobs they kill.
They NEED that gear. I only do that when I'm trying to get skill-ups in
defense and offense.

We get some of the coolest toys in the game. Not nearly as wide a
selection as the melee classes, but nothing to turn your nose up at
either.

Play a warrior if you want gear to be the end-all be-all of your
existance. Otherwise you should be ashamed of yourself. I wonder what the
last warrior thought when he watched you kill a high-blue to yellow con
without ever once raising your weapon in anger or taking a single point of
damage?
