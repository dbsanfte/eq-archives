It does go up, but it takes a while.  Going from skill 0 to skill 1 can take
forever for some skills.  I spent three levels with Sense Heading at 0 for
one character, before I finally got the increase to 1, then it pretty much
went straight to 25 before I was even out of level 4 (I have SH keyed to my
forward key, so it's pretty much always maxed).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
