I think this is an EXCELLENT idea! Maybe we should all petition them to do
this.
The DVD age is here, and they should make that an option for everyone. The
last
time I had to reinstall after a trashed hard drive was just after Velious. I
couldn't
find my Kunark CD so had to hunt for 2 days. Both my main guys were in ill
omen!
But the main reason they haven't so far is that not everyone has a DVD
player in
their computer! (sounds silly for a company to worry about that when they
just
caused the biggest computer upgrade in the country since the pentium
replaced the
486) By the next expansion, DVD players should be around the $50 mark, and
that
isn't too much to expect for a player to replace! 8-)
Then again, they COULD offer the expansion and then sell the "EQ DVD
collectors
tin" with cloth map, lead figure, handy keyboard template, and blackened
iron swiss
army knife!  Oops, sorry. slipped into my sleazy PR personae for a moment.
