I realize that you needed to vent, but I'd lose that attitude.  It's
incredibly condescending.  

I'm not sure when you started playing, but there was a time in this
game when fine steel and leather was standard kit.  With the
introduction of the 30-day free trial for Old World EQ, you may start
running into it again.  There is no longer a bazaar in East Commons,
and not everyone has access to the bazaar or PoK.

Also, the game is open to a wide variety of players, different ages,
different cultures, and they might not be aware of all the nuances of
the game.  The last thing the community needs is more derisive
treatment of new players.  Treating them as such puts you on the same
level as that Kalshazaar troll.

If the game is not just about you, but the group, then don't force the
other members to cater to your play style.  Take it as an opportunity
to show someone the ropes.

Now, if they come back with a "STFU, this is just an alt, I already
beat Tacvi with my uber guild."  then by all means, go off.  But I
think in the majority of cases this is not going to happen.  They
aren't the ones likely to go the poverty route.  But the people who
don't know otherwise could use the knowledge you may possess.

We were all newbies once.
