Normally I do see the server selection screen and I pick my server (Innoruuk) 
and play as normal.  However if they are patching I never get the server 
select screen and I can never connect.  I get to the point where I put my 
username and password in and when I hit connect I get an error message saying 
either the servers are congested or they are not available.  Only way for me 
to get in is to wait for the patching to be completed.  Am I doing something 
wrong?

Also another question about the Kael Drakkal and Sebelis servers.  If I play 
on them would I be unable to chat with others since I only speak english?  
Would all the text be unreadable to me?  Would I be wasting my time playing on 
those servers?
