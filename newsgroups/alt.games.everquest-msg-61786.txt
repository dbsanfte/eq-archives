This is very important.

I was leveling my monk in FOB one fine day and this lizard came over to me
starting to harass and beg.  He was a higher level even and I had nothing on
me but raw silk clothing.  After about 20 minutes of me and another telling
him we had nothing to give *he didn't understand monks are not known for
carrying around stuff to give away* he started to harm touch/ cast/ and
attack my mobs.  I asked him the first time to stop hoping he was trying to
be "helpful" in some dumb way yet he took my kill and exp.  The second time
he started my partner petitioned as did I (we weren't grouped up my friend
and I so didn't know he petitioned).  He once again Ksed me for pure joy.
The GM advised me to not tell him I petitioned.  Unfortunately the bugger
wandered off and the GM never got to see it.  but The GM was nice and said
the second he does it again to give him a yell.  *he did it again a few
hours later but no gm was on).
But from what the gm said, telling them your going to petition will scare
them off and they won't get caught or for the real rare encourage them to
keep doing it.
