Well, even then, I -still- wouldn't be a gay cop... and it's easy enough 
to get cuffs if I want.  The point is that cops have a 'special right' to 
march around with a firearm.  Whether or not the cop is gay is not an 
issue.  And yes, there were a whole bunch of gay cops in the pride parade.  
Quite a few straight ones there to show support for their friends, too.

And quite a few more there to keep anyone from starting a fight with the 
predictable protesters with big banners with quotes from Leviticus.  Sigh.
