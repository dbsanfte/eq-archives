   You click on logs and rocks all day at a data entry job?  Man.  I had a
data entry job once, and I was typing stupid numbers onto a stupid keyboard
all day.  

   Anyways, I'm also forgoing tradeskills, at least for now.  I know that
in EQL tradeskills can be a good way to get money, but they can also be a
hugh plat and time sink as well.  And you're right about them making EQ
seem like a job.  I quit EQL because it was starting to feel like a job to
me, and my tradeskills habit was a big part in that.
