Did you try right-clicking and holding on your primary slot? The equip
icons were garbled ( As has been discussed in SEVERAL previous
threads. Hey, try reading a bit, it's amazing what you find ), and
some items had "invisible" icons. ( The slot appeared empty, but it
was there. Right clicking for item description found it present )
