How patheticly lame.  Here, let's quote you again:

This was in direct response to my post.  Trying to say now that because
you did not use the words "YOUR statement" you were not trying (and
failing) to summarize what I said is just plain stupid.

Utter bullshit.  The game itself validates the dual view in blatantly
obvious fashion:  the magics wielded by Clerics vs. Paladin are
FAR more similar than those wielded by Clerics vs. Druid/Shaman.

The alternate view I gave does NOT deny that.  It is simply a
different perspective.  Are you so hopelessly narrowminded that you
simply cannot comprehend complexity?

A faint glimmer of comprehension appears, but then...

You misattribute that sentiment.  I never stated nor implied that I want
Paladins to get a CHeal spell.  In fact, elsewhere in the thread I note
that we already get an insta-cast "scaled down" CHeal once a day.  I was
simply responding to your narrowminded kneejerk reply to Dan.

Lame.  This is the second time you have misstated what I wrote, and
it is essentially the same misstatement.  Are you really that dense?
Or is this your "new technique"?

You really don't have a clue what I said here, do you?
