You should give jewelcraft a try. :) It's one of the cheapest tradeskills
to bring to grand mastery. Since you can sell back the items you made
for skillups the only thing you need is a large enough budget to buy
the gems and metal bars stackwise.

Sure it's ok when it is free. But most of the tradeskills don't require
you to run around much for skilling up to 54. The interesting part is
how to skill up after 180. :)
