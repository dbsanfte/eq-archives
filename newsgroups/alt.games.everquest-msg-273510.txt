I agree completely, though maybe not with all the reasons you cite. (Oi, 
this could get ugly...)

You can thank the player base for that one. Remember "The Vision"? 
People can say what they want, but I think it had much more of the right 
idea than the wrong.

I never really thought of it that way. I don't know if that's a big 
factor or not. No matter. By the time the new tutorial was implemented, 
all hope was lost anyway.

Yup.

I have often wondered how the heck Troll Nation could have been overrun 
by frogs. Maybe it was because they had no clerics and CH chains.

Racial penalties made a lot of sense back in the day, but not for some 
time now.

Yup.

At this point it doesn't matter. Except for the true newbie, all value 
the starting cities offer has been lost.

Idiot? A bit harsh there. The complimentary backpack is one change that 
I applauded. One of the most frustrating things I can remember from my 
first few new characters was not having enough inventory/bank slots.

Honestly though, LDoN aside, are there really that many instanced 
dungeons? I don't seem to come across too many others in the middle of a 
battle though, now that you mention it.

Quite true. Still, people wanted new stuff, so what were they to do?

Oh, I think the devs have a very good idea of what contributes to charm 
and immersion. After all, I'm sure many are players themselves. 
Unfortunately when they bowed to too many customer demands, they wound 
up with a situation where they had strayed too far from what made the 
game famous and great in the first place. It's unfortunate in this case 
that people demanded instant gratification over long-term rewards.

That part doesn't bother me at all, really. I don't really connect the 
two that much. I mean, sure, they're obviously linked in terms of lore, 
but the games are different enough to stand on their own just fine.

Perhaps your point is more of a philosophical issue. In that case, the 
characters shouldn't know any of that in the first place. ;)

I agree, but I also have to admit that it's also due partially to the 
fact that you can never go home again.
