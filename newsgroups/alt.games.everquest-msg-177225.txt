The place is only sanity-crushing if you aren't getting two of the
rooms (WR/RR or LR/GR). If you're stuck with one, then even though the
exp is still 'fair' the mindnumbing boringness isn't worth it.

An early Verant effort at dynamic NPCs. :-) They improved on this
later with Thurgadin.

It's always a problem. HHK is on par with Paludal for how fast exp
comes in, but there aren't all that many goblins down there.


> or because some stupid iksar monk is soloing the LR again

People shouldn't really complain about that, but at the same time a
polite soloer should consider giving up the spot to a group.

That faction boost can be helpful.

That should be discouraged in the strongest possible terms. Those are
the kind of jerks who make me want PvP in EQ.

I can handle it to 32/33. :-) You can keep going all the way to 40 if
you spawn the rogue on the roof, but that is THE, yes THE most boring
thing in all of EQ, bar none.
