Since a few weeks back I've been getting disconnected from server just 
as I camp out severeal times. Just as the camp countdown has finished 
and it should camp out to char select I get the "you have been 
disconnected" screen. I noticed my friend had this happen to him too, so 
I'm wondering if we are the only ones, or others have noticed it too?

Most times it doesn't really matter but sometimes it does. Yesterday we 
had too many adds at camp, ench, shaman and I (cleric) were pretty much 
oom so with a few mezzed and a few rootparked we decided to camp out for 
a few mins. I sat down and /camp:ed. Managed to sit for 30 seconds then 
got disconnected. Our SK tank that was still in game told me I got the 
normal linkdeath and started fighting mobs for another 30 seconds which 
was enough for me to get killed.

Anyone else seen this lately?
