Yes, god forbid anyone who isn't a raider feel entitled to play in the 
next expansion. They bought it. Their entitled to feel ripped off if 
they can't go in deeper than the first couple zones while wearing a 
solid kit of 1-groupabble items from the previous expansion, unless they 
have some raiders along to hold their hands.

Seriously. The 1-groupers aren't complaining that they can't kill the 
GoD boss or that they can't kill the ooW boss...or even that they can't 
get the best items in the game per se... they're complaining that they 
can't even kill the OoW 1-group content because they aren't Raid 
equipped from the previous expansions.

Its a legitimate problem whether raid-snobs want to acknowledge it or 
not.
