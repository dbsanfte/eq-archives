Y'know, it's an amazing coincidence that the OP for this thread is Dennis /
spliffeh@hotmail.com, while you are XenonXavier / spliffeh@hotmail.com.


Now Dennis, on 2004 / 04 / 29, 8:11 PM, posted:

OK guys... please refrain from flaming me... But I'm done with EQ &
wondering if my guys are worth anything.... Any advice is welcomed....

"... wondering if my guys are worth anything..."

I've blown 5 years of my life on this, I'm sure you guys know what I mean...
I would appreciate honest input: Are my guys worth anything?

The point I stress is that they are a dual box system, which is unique....
There is nothing like me on my server.... My two accounts will only be sold
as set. All my

"... My two accounts will only be sold as a set..."

guys are twins, named & dressed the same. There are 6 twins in the set, all
above 50, two of them are mains with level 65 and 100+aa. The mains are
druid and enc with dire charms. If you know anything about this game you
know that is a deadly combo, I solo stuff that groups of 6 wipe out on. It
is a dual box dream, there is NO combo that beats dru & enc with dc. (this
is not up for arguement, newbs pls dont respond to that).

THE QUESTION: Where do i ebay, since ebay is dead? Is there still a market?
What is the most popular site for this? Are my guys worth anything? How
much, ballpark?

"... Where do I ebay..."


But you're right.  You, XenonXavier (spliffeh@hotmail.com), didn't post that
you were trying to sell 2 accounts.  This guy Dennis (spliffeh@hotmail.com)
did.  You're right, I'm wrong, I humbly apologize.

(Copy down the above last sentence and save it; you'll rarely see it's
like.)

Y'know, maybe 5 years and 300 days played makes me only a newbie in EQ1, but
I'll tell ya, 4 years playing with Google means... Google is not YOUR
friend.
