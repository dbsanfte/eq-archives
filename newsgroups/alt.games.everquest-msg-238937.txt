}>I wish this kind of information was included in item descriptions!  Arrrggggh!
}Indeed.  Every couple of weeks I /feedback that from the game,
}saying that the item info boxes should include the following information:
}1.  Haste amount of haste items.
<snip>
}But the devs haven't taken the hint yet.  Maybe if we *ALL* do it
}on a regular basis...
}It's lame that we have to run to other information sources for this
}info instead of having it available ingame.

...

OMG! They actually gave us this one!  Put the item in a trader's satchel, 
and do a bazaar search with item stat set to 'haste'.  And presto!  
There's how much haste it has!

Guess that page of my site is kinda obsolete now. :)

Also, be warned if you're used to haste being a choice under item type, 
they moved it. :)
