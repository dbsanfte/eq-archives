I'm not an expert on necros, but I've played a DE mage up to 50 (not an expert 
on mages, either).  Seems to me that necros have a bit less down time than 
mages because necros have ways of regenerating mana faster than the normal 
rate at which a mage regenerates mana.  So faster mana regen = faster hunting. 
Plus necros get some really nice bonuses that mages don't get like root, 
snare, fear and shadowstep.
