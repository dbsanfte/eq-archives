Hello,
I believe the Gnome in the blue house is on the "Gem Cutters" faction.  You
state that your Bard faction is bad, I'm assuming you were hunting the Bard
in SK.  If so he gives neg faction to both the bards and gemcutters.  So
that might be your problem. Or you could just run around the other side of
the buildings :)

Good Luck!
