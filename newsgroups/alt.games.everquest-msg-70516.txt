Just wondering if there's a relationship between those two paragraphs,
Dan? Are you saying somehow the cleric was doing something wrong? (I
mean aside from not checking the web boards. Different issue.) We have
the same rule, or at least practice, in our guild. Big stones (diamond,
BS, BD, etc.) get rolled on, but the rest go to the cleric. The cleric
in our group last night got easily a thousand PP in gems down in Seb,
and certainly spent FAR less on the peridots. But that's our practice,
so we were happy for her. Problem?
