Basically you have to get more RAM no question about it.

**WinXP doesnt like this low of a resolution because of the DX8.1 graphic
basis it requires a higher res to function.  If you have a good monitor
being at 640x480 is a waste of resources.... What I do is run in the medium
res range in full screen works great.

**Oh yes it would cause problems...  WinXP on average uses 110Mb Ram
constantly.  that only leaves 18Mb left for anything else.  I have 256Mb
still a little sluggish but thats because of my processor.  I also had to
raise my virtual memory to START:1.0 GB and MAx to 1.5 GB.  When I am
running XP my system was paging about 600 to 800 MB of virtual memory.

**Again memory issue.  your system cant swap out the info fast enough with
less than 20Mb to work with.
