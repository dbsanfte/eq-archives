}I don't think he's talking about voluntary prayer.

Well, that was my assumption.  But the permission slips would be the usual 
hassle.  Of course, the trick is, we already managed to sneak Buddhist 
prayer into preschools... we just call it naptime. :)

}If he is, I would have
}no problem hearing a muslim saying a prayer, as long as he doesn't pray for
}the death of all us infidels... of course, I also wouldn't want to hear a
}Baptist pray for God to kill all us godless heathens, either.  As far as a
}buddhist prayer or Hindu... why not?  Though, I imagine things would get
}quite loud with all the different religions doing their thing at the same
}time.  Just as long as the Mormons don't get to say anything.  Tunare knows
}what those guys would do.

Ooh! We should lobby for Tunarean treehugging hour! :)  The Mormons do 
worry me, but... well... not much more than the others up there, when it 
comes right down to it.  They might worry me less if I got to see them 
pray, but they don't allow heathens in Temple.

I wonder, if it was structured as a unit in comparative religion... hmm.

}Anything other than voluntary must come from the government, whether it's
}mandated by congress or the principal.  That would be unconstitutional.

Hmm.  But the amendment says 'Congress shall make no law...' Doesn't say a 
darn thing about principals.
