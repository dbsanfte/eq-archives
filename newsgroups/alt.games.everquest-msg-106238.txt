 Sure there is. Better innate resists to things like mob AE, better
damage tables, no more xp camps (before the advent of AA. Or even after
if so inclined). Generally for me I have a lot more time for actually
playing when I don't have to spend time XPing.

 I have much more fun at 60 than I did getting there for the most part.
Retire at 60? No way. That's when things start getting good.
