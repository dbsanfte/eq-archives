This is the heart of the matter. CoH is not EQ in tights.
The concepts of killstealing, camping etc don't exist.

It is not even obvious that people feel they have done anything wrong when 
they follow another hero and kill off the bosses once he has defeated the 
minions.  Perhaps they think of it as specialization, division of labor, 
informal teamwork.  There are lots of newbies on at any given time who 
have never played EQ, DAoC or The Realms.  There is no reason why they 
should find anything wrong with "helping" another hero unless repeatedly 
told so by several people.
It is not something your mother teaches you at home.  It is not something 
you learn at school. It is not even written in the Bible. It is just a 
convention in certain games.
