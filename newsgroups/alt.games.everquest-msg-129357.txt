Actually, for evil types, swim ashore, through the wall, and get bound on
the beach not too far from the docks.  It's a fairly safe spot, sort of like
non evil types binding just inside the Outpost in OT.  To get out of FV,
just swim back out, swim ashore, and go wherever you want to go.
Alternatively, get a bind just inside Cabilis from the LoIO zone.  This is a
bit trickier, requires invis to get out, and you have to avoid the nasty
dude that sees invis and wanders around the LoIO side of the zone.
