    I'll start - hasn't happened to me. I've never been at any camp for an
extended period of time and had someone come and blow it out from under me,
let alone had someone do this then tell me to get bent.

    I've had this happen exactly once. I was talking to a friend's druid
within sight of the SK/Lake zone when someone in puppy form ran up to us,
ran around us twice with an Avocet close behind, then zoned when it didn't
peel. That's it.

    By avoiding being close to zone lines, well-known "hangouts" in outdoor
zones, and just plain avoiding soloists, I've managed to avoid having any
other such encounters. If you aren't near a zone line, you don't get popped
with legitimate trains or unscrupulous trainers that have the mob below 50%
and just want some "help", offered or otherwise. Same with the "hangouts" -
people will beeline places like Docks in Oasis or Windmill in LoIO, knowing
that people will be there that might help. And by avoiding being near
soloists you avoid the class of players most likely to both fail in an
encounter and be able to single-mindedly train you.

    I try and resolve the situation without doing something to cause it to
happen again, like spaz out in an apoplectic fit of rage. As I told the
uberguild twink that shouted "Call ur trains, NEWB!" when he got trained:
"You do realize he now wants to train you for calling him a newb, right? And
that nobody's learned anything?"
