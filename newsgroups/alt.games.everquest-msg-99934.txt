Uh, that's rediculous.

It's not like they're inspecting your underwear or something.

This is all CLOTHES and things you are WEARING/USING.  They can see it
anyway, who gives a flying fack if they wanna know the names?  It's not like
they can even see the stats, they can't see how much money you have or what
you're carrying.  It'd be like somebody coming up to you and looking at your
clothes IRL.
oh NO!  Somebody get this man a super-body-shield!!!
