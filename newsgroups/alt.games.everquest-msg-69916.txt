Which hybrid would that be? Bards are their *most* useful post-50
because they can replace an enchanter in the CC slot for 80% of camps
and pull with Selo's where others fear to tread. Shadowknights and
Monks are needed for feign-pull. Rangers suck post-50, but at least
they've already have 50+ levels to get used to it. The only hybrid
that really LOSES functionality post-50 AFAICT is the paladin.
