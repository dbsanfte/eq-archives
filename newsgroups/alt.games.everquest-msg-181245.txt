I log my bazaar trader on to pick up some stuff one night.  I had not been in
*one minute* and this guy starts bitching about me standing in his way.   And
not in tell, in "say".  So I don't even realize that the JerkOff is talking to
me.  Next thing I know he's actually *calling me names* in /ooc for standing in
his way!  I try to explain to him but he's too busy being a DickHead so I did
the logical thing.  /ignore.
Some people's kids.  Bah.
