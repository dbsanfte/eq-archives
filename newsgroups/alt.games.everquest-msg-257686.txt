That's interesting.  For those who haven't played it, here is a brief
description of how DAoC concentration buffs work.  Basically, there are some
buffs that work like EQ buffs--they take Power (mana) to cast, and then have
a timer.  You can cast as many of them as you want, as long as you have
Power.

The other kind of buff uses Concentration instead of Power.  You have a
fixed amount of concentration, say, 100 points.  If you cast a Concentration
buff that uses 20 Concentration, you Concentration drops to 80.  It does NOT
regenerate.  The buff stays up on the target until you or he dies, or you or
he explicitly remove the buff, or one of you zones, and then you get the
points back.  (They later changed it so your self-buffs don't fall when you
zone.  I don't recall if Concentration buffs you have cast on others fall or
not when zoning).

So, if you have 100 points, and 3 buffs available that take 20 each, you
could give one person all 3 buffs, and 2 buffs to another.  Or you could
buff 5 people with one buff each.  And so on.

These buffs aren't restricted to the group, but note that if someone not in
your group gives you such a buff, you have to take into account that (1)
they might remove it at any time if they need to get the concentration back,
or they might die or zone or camp at any time and you'll lose the buffs.
So, depending on a Concentration-based buff from someone who isn't in your
group can be risky.

Within the group, you still need to be careful.  If you've got some good
Concentration-based buffs on you from a party member, if that party member
dies, your buffs are gone.  So if you find a buff important in combat, you
need to keep the buffer alive.

The Concentration system has an interesting benefit for the game designers.
It adds another dimension for increasing spell power: combined spells.
For example, Clerics get as part of their base spells STR and CON buffs.
Clerics who specialize in buffing get a combined STR and CON buff that is
more efficient than separately buffing STR and CON.  With buffs that work
like EQ1 buffs, a combined buff would not be that big a deal...it would just
be a little more convenient to cast.
