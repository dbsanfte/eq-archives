    To what end? Seriously, Dennis: what do you hope to accomplish by making
the *lower* levels more difficult, by making items more difficult for anyone
to use or trade, by making half the damn encounters in the game need
re-tuning? Right now, balance is fair: you fight the easier mobs of earlier
expansions, you get more XP and less loot. You fight the harder mobs of
newer expansions, you might get loot you'd use and slower XP.
Level-restricting items makes mobs more difficult across the board, while
the same loot continues to drop (but it "feels" better). What does that
change that makes the whole process worthwhile? Is it worth nerfing 400 K
subscribers so the next ones feel a bit better about existing loot drops as
they level up?

    I'd love to hear why. I think I know the reason - you always were a "ban
the Mox, don't keep them around" type - but I'd like to see it spelled out.
