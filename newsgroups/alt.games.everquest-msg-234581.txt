I read somewhere about how you need to be careful what you put in your
ranged slot.  If you happen to be charmed you will in all likelihood lose
that weapon because you will throw it.  My question is if you do not have
any ability to use a ranged weapon will you still throw it if you get
charmed and lose it?  My character is a Shaman and I have a Howling Harpoon
in my Ranged slot.  I do not however have the ability to do a ranged attack.
Is that harpoon safe or do I need to worry about losing it when I get around
mobs that can charm me?
