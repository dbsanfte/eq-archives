Nope, once placed on an item, the augment is comitted.  You can remove 
the augment, say in order to replace it with a better one, or (on 
servers other than Firiona Vie) sell the item assuming it is droppable, 
but doing so destroys the augment.

Thus far, no augment I've seen has been worth losing sleep over 
destroying; I have a few resist augments and a number of Int augments, 
and I've sold off a couple of items with augments still stuck to them 
without a qualm.

I'm probably sitting on an extra 40 int or so in augments spread over my 
  gear, which means I didn't have to sweat buying gear to get my mana 
pool up, could make choices that favored HP, or more often, just let my 
old outdated gear stand rather than camp cash to replace it, and level 
up instead.

But if I do replace a piece of gear, I don't sweat the augment, I know 
that by doing another day's worth of LDoN runs I'll get a better one.  I 
always put my latest int augs on the items I currently think I'll have 
the longest, if I replace a piece of gear, its very likely one I've had 
a long time and have been thinking about replacing... so any augment it 
has is probably from many levels ago when that item was on the "this 
will be with me a while" list.  Higher I level, the higher the stats on 
the augments that drop, so I'll be throwing away a +3 int augment, and 
soon replacing it on the new, better item with a +6 int augment.

Too, I'm already flirting with the int cap, and only the fact that once 
over 60 I can raise that cap keeps me at all interested in more Int.

Splendid One, 58 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
