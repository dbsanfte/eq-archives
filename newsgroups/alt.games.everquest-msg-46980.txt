	People playing Humans did not choose an easy levelling race...they chose a
hard one.

	Easily-levelling races are ones like the various Elves and shorties, the
guys who get high attribute, racial skills, night vision and NO EP PENALTY.
Humans have *no advantage* over any of these races...and one of them
(Halflings) levels FASTER.

	If all you wanted was night vision, you picked the wrong race.  If you
wanted the rest of the Iksar package, you're paying for what you get.
