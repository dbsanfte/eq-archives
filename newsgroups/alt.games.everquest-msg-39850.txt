This is just wild ass speculation here, but I'm going to guess that the xp for
any given creature is a function of its level (for those with a varying level
range) and some "base xp" number assigned in design. Therefore, you could have
one lvl 30 mob in OT with one amount of xp and another of the same level with a
different amount.  I'm trying to picture why the designers would lock the same
amount of XP onto a wildly dangerous Rhino as they would onto a cactus.

Sadly, no. I'm going on my entirely fallible memory here, with no link coming to
mind. So my figures could be *slightly* off. (i.e. plus or minus 30 levels.)
