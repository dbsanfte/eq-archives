They are decent for most folks up until the upper-40s...the damage bonus
really starts to kick in, and many weapons start to seriously out-damage
it.

This is a load of crap, in more ways than one:
1) When not talking about multi-group encounters, RANGERS ARE SUPERB TANKS
ALL THE WAY FROM LEVEL 1 TO LEVEL 60.

2) The wurmslayer, while slow, taunts quite well because of how hard it
hits.

The reason the earthcaller gets rangers killed is not because it is fast,
but because its proc has lethally high aggro value. Proc + Slow + DoT =
massive taunt.
