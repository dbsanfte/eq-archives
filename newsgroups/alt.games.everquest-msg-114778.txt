The damage is down to your skill at the weapon you are wielding and the DMG
stat of the weapon.Until you reach level twenty the damage you do is capped.

Soloing is not the way to play EQ effectively as a melee or melee hybrid.
You should group more often.

Oasis is perfect for your level, the sand giants are a hazard but can be
avoided. Perhaps the one you met was Cazel who is a rare spawn who crushes
lower levels like ants.

Yes, go view the statue in Firiona Vie. Take the shuttles from Butcher Block
and jump onto the big ship in Timerous Deep and it will take you there. he
there is your late teens and go play in Lake of Ill Omen.
