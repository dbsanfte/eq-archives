Hey if you've got any on Bristlebane....

One of my alts recieved a tell in Gfay telling him to find the teller. When
I found him he promptly unloaded 20k of equipment and plat on me without a
word.

I think you should probably hold some kind of contest to worm out twinks and
newbs that dont give a shit about the game. That way your stuff goes to a
deserving person.
