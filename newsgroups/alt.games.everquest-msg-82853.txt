You're right.  You SHOULDN'T have to.  But I have a separate system for my 4
and 5 year olds to beat on.  My 4 yr old daughter manages to destroy the OS
in ways I have never seen nor ever imagined!  What does she do?  If
something doesn't work instantateously she clicks and clicks and clicks
absolutely everything she can.  Turn your head and the damage is done.

I only need some way to child-proof their system, like I have done to all
the cabinets in the house, hehe.

Parents be warned!
