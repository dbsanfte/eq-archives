Aye, but with a tailoring of 54 how much less often would you fail
making those wonderful items? Skilling up on things that can sell for
more than 50pp in the Bazaar doesn�t seem like a good idea, when there
is a way to get higher than that for free. (I say sell for more than
50pp in the Bazaar, and I mean it. On FV the average price for a LQ
pelt if 5pp, with some selling as high as 10pp, same for the
spiderling silks. So a total of 15 to 30pp for each padding, if
successful. Most paddings sell for 15 to 25pp on FV. (People farming
the materials, or buying them under market value.) But I sold
literally 200 at 50pp (In one fell swoop might I add) and I have no
doubt that they would have sold the same at 55 or 60pp. However I've
had 17 in my inventory at 50pp for a week, without them being sold.
It�s a matter of scale. This being said, I can only imagine what they
sell for on other servers.)
