As far as I know mobs that are not being attacked stay rooted much much
longer than ones not being attacked. I dont care if its procs or not but if
you want something rooted *dont anyone attack it* please. In any case
everyone should be assisting the MT so to me that necro was just doing a
piss poor job.
