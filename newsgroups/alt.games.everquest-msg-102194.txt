Most 55+ camps require some sort of evac if things go squirrely or a
porter and necro on-call for possible CR. Without evac, you're pretty
much restricted to Velks's (minus the pit,) OS (NG, Crypt,) Chardok
(Sarge, Observer, Bridgekeeper,) Maiden's Eye, the Deep (entrance
only,) and Fungus Grove.

As a rogue, I'm less interested in a wizard's damage than a druid's
ability to snare, heal, buff, and DS.

I played a necro to 55 and my DoTs hardly ever got me summoned. Of
course, Splurt is amazing in that environment and has almost zero
aggro. Scourge was higher aggro, but also stopped MOb regen. Waiting
until 70% would usually keep me from getting summoned.
