The amount of xp lost on death is a fixed percentage based off of the
amount it took to get through your previous level. Once you pass 50,
xp costs to level take a dramatic upswing. The % of xp to get through
51 that's lost when you died is less, but that's only because it costs
so much more to get through 51 than it did to get through 50. This
effect was also visible during hell levels and in reverse post-hell
levels before they smoothed them out (which caused the illusion of the
level being a "mini-level", and there were those who would argue til
they were blue in the face that it cost less to get through 46 than
47, 48, and 49...).
