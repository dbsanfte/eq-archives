Used to be Sarrin Thunderfoot (30 Halfling Warrior),
now Aluaeia Evangelion (55 Wood Elf Preserver) , unguilded since my last one
disbanded a few months ago (Blades of Tyrra) when I had my most untimely
modem dirtnap ever (guild leader said he was disbanding unless someone else
took over leadership, I was typing out a /tell to him that I'd take over but
went LD before I could send it and when I got back on, he'd already
disbanded) but should be getting guildinvited tonight for Infamous since
Clan of Shadows has an annoying level 60 requirement for druids as opposed
to 58 for everybody else (yeah, I know I'm not 58, but one of their 2 active
non-bot mages is an RL friend and could probably get me in if I wasn't the
'special' class).

Plus a bunch of alts I never play except to dump tradeskill/warrior crap on
one, caster crap on another, and drag corpses in kael on a third.

You might want to visit the TM forums over at www.realpoor.com if you can
tolerate the idiots, morons, flaming, ebaying and porn, and assuming there
was a point to your asking who was on TM on the newsgroup.
