1) Stop tanking.  You are a necro.  Very little should be hitting you and
when something is you should be looking to make it stop, not to suck
it up like a cleric

2) Your AC sucks.  It will always suck.  If you are twinked to the gills
your AC will be credible thru level 30 or so but eventually it will
still suck.  There is little you can do about this and there's very little
reason to care.  Don't pursue AC as a necro (or other "pure caster"
for that matter)

3) Don't buy from vendors.  Vendors make their living ripping you
off.  You want to buy from players.  For 400 pp from a player
you can get a robe that would cost you 4000pp from a vendor...
and that vendor is offering the guy who is selling the robe 40pp for it.
This is what drives the player economy.  There are a few exceptions
to this, such as spider silks, bone chips, crushbone belts... but
even with those the vendor paid the seller far less than he's charging
you, its just that other players will pay even more than that.

4) finding players selling what you need can be time consuming, be
prepared to spend a while on the project.  You can go to East
Commons or Greater Faydark on almost every server and find
a weath of sellers, or you can find the auctions channel on
your server and see sellers from all over Norrath... (on Morell
Thule its
/join auctions:auctions
but who knows on your server)

5) you might also watch for a while to see how it works and
then start auctioning off some of your stuff that others seem
to want, or watch for WTB (want to buy) messages.
