He wasn't aware of any faction opportunities there. I was just pointing
out that there is one opportunity. Doesn't make either of them right in
the camp stealing department, but it is a reason for somebody to go in
there and farm greens. Oh, and an Idol of the Thorned while you're in
the neighborhood I suppose. But slaughtering greens near the entrance
that some lowbies already have camped? No.  Said lowbies training him?
Also no. Sounds more like both parties needed to just go log off and
take a walk for a bit to me.
