It's enough to be functional. I don't kite and know most of the zones I 
pull in, so...

Yeah, Adamantite Stone Band and Crown of King Tormax (I think?) both of 
which are spendy.

Admittedly... But after the epic, it becomes a much better deal.

Yes, I did forget that minor AC bonus.

At the time I made my choice(Pre-Luclin) it was a major concern.

Pulling monks make much better use of Run 3.

No, it does not count as sitting, and FD flat on my back is the one time I 
do wish I was an ikky.

Then again, at level 60 a human monk gets 4 stand 5 fd and 7 seated, while 
an ikky gets 12 stand 14 fd and 18 seated... So 90hp/minute more than a 
human. That's hardly a massive amount.

*really* sucks, if you want to go all the way AA. Keep in mind they will 
end up spending 1.25 (ish) times the amount of exp grinding to get an AA 
point as the human monk.

PoP was but a dream when I started my Monk...
