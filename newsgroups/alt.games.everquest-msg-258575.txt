I'm not really conversant with the things, as far as I know I've never 
played on a server that has them at all.

BUT when I did see them discussed ages ago, the general plan was to use 
them between fights, sucking yourself down to practically no HP at all, 
then letting regen take you back up.  Self only port is pretty cheap, 
and gate very cheap, no heal needed at all; the idea being to take your 
10 minute time to regen a full mana bar and turn it into a three minute 
time to regen say a quarter mana bar and half a HP bar.

OR to use them as I used to use mod rods on my cleric; to suck down to 
near death and then spend a mere 400 mana getting it all back; with mod 
rods the profit margin on this exercise was enormous.  WOuld a druid's 
"incomplete heal" work nearly as well?  Guess it depends on the druid's 
HP total.  I know that was true of cleric, getting HP as high as 
possible was a very large boost in effectiveness of the mod dance.

Your suggestion is closer to the way mod rods work now, where you can 
only use them every so often, as a boost, rather than wholesale and 
taking advantage of high efficiency heals/regen (which is itself a high 
efficiency heal).  My shaman did this too, with cannidance, I guess 
manastones are really just Canni for the masses.

None for druids then, but still, whats the cost to cast a self port
to an old world zone?  Gate costs 50 mana, not counting any MP or
specialization discounts.  Thats a lot cheaper than casting a CHeal, and 
my gain using the CHeal plan was still very much worth my while
