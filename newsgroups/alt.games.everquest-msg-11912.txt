All warrior races can wear plate and crafted, other than Iksar which you
already ruled out.

Among the good races, the "best" warriors are Barbarians or Dwarves.

Barbarians get slam, which is a major advantage for warrior classes up until
level 55, but are nightblind and have some size problems with being too big to
fit in some dungeons without shrink or a crowbar.

Dwarves have great stats and small size (also allowing them to wear lighter
armor at certain parts of the game) and start with infravision, but they do
not have the slam ability.  (I play a dwarf myself)

Your race won't have a huge impact on your game though, unless you're of the
min/max persuasion.  I know very successful gnome and dark elf warriors,
despite any stat problems and lack of slam...  just play what you'll have fun
with.

Actually you should be keeping up all of the weapon skills that you can.  One
hand Slash and One hand Blunt, definitely.   I'd very much recommend keeping 2
hand slash maxed as well, as until level 30 or so, dual wield doesn't go off
enough to offset the higher damage/delay ratio on most 2 handed weapons.   2
hand blunt is very hard to keep maxed, but if you do that as well there are
some very good weapons of that type available in the end-game.   I'm not sure
how many good warrior piercers there are, but I suppose I'd recommend keeping
that going as well, since it's easy to raise.

It's quite a bit of work to cover several of them, but in the higher levels
you will have plenty of time to catch up any that are lagging behind.
You'll thank yourself later when an amazing piercing / 2 handed blunt / 1
handed blunt drops into your lap, and you're able to use it since you put in
that little extra work earlier, (instead of passing on something good since
you don't have the right skills for it.)
