Fond memories, yeah.

There's another problem. In fact, my major beef with PoP. Travel was
too much of a pain in the ass in the early days of EQ. The boats were
just stupidly long rides where you could do nothing but sit on your
ass for 30-45 minutes and go make a sandwich.

SoL, I think, put it to just the right spot with the Nexus.

PoP...PoP trivialized it waaaaay too much. Almost anywhere you want to
go, you have a quick hop there a few zones away at most (with some
exceptions). It stopped being a world and became...a block.
