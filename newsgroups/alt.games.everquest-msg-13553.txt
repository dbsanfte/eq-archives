You weren't at the same x,y.  You can actually be quite a bit away
from the mob and still be meleeing.  When you have something as large
as a dragon, "max melee" distance can be as big as 30 feet away.

Hell, if you've seen the Progenitor in ST, you'll realize "max melee
distance" is somewhere in Eastern Wastes by the bridge.

They were chain rezzing meleers and tanks to keep the rez effect on
them.  This also wipes all aggro of them.  That means it doesn't take
long before the only people on the aggro list are the clerics.  They
*HAD* to CoH these clerics to wipe aggro.  Of course, since it looked
like they had only one mage and at least 6 clerics, given the 12
second casting time and 15 second hold time of CoH, this wasn't gonna
work.

Not melee range.  At the same x, y coordinates as the mob--try it,
it's interesting since the mob will just beat on you, knock you back a
bit and then summon you back to the spot (except it will also summon
you up the z-axis as well).

See above.
Basically the meleers were being "pre-rezzed".  
From the sound of it, they had the rez acceptance box up while
meleeing.  When they gained aggro or res effect poofed, they would
click on the Yes and boom, instant aggro wipe and refresh of the rez
effect.

This was actually a dumb thing to do.  Because it removed from the
aggro list those folks you WANT on the aggro list, the tanks.  Sorry,
but having just one tank attempt to hold the aggro isn't safe.  One
bad lag, one bad proc, one slight mistiming of the heals and the "main
tank" is dead.  Can't switch to a different tank since none of the
other tanks have managed to generate enough aggro--so who gets to
tank?  The clerics.
