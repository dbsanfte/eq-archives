 Yeah, this is what it really comes down to, in my opinion.  Most of the
GM-run events I've witnessed have been pretty unentertaining for the players
involved, though I have heard of a few good ones.  If anything, to me, this
indicates a need for more practice on the part of the GMs and better quality
control.

  Simply spawning and possessing a "badass" mob that's 30 levels higher than
what normally roams the zone and then going on a rampage is not, in my
opinion, a quality event.  I'd like to see things more along the lines of a
GM spawning a "bandit captain" near a normal bandit camp, who may be 3 or 4
levels higher than most bandits with the benefit of the "human intelligence"
of the GM controlling it.  A group camping the bandits may be able to take
the GM character if they keep their wits about them, though one or two
members of the party might die.  However, there should be a reward to
counterbalance it... give the bandit captain some moderate lowbie gear...
maybe a Combine weapon, some bronze armor and 20pp or so.  It's something
the group will probably enjoy and remember.

  Or just have non-combat oriented events, like the one it sounds like the
original poster described... where out of the ordinary characters appear
just to play around and inject some flavor in to the atmosphere, and maybe
present a minor quest, puzzle or game of sorts.

  I don't have a problem with players dying during GM events, but it
shouldn't be about a level 40 skeleton popping out of the ground and laying
waste to all nearby newbies before they realize what's hitting them.
