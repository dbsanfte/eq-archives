Well, the *specific* answer to your question is that you can. You can
*ZONE* out from the entry area. And, in fact, if your evac person is
dead this can be a very handy tool, and I've used it. Clears the aggro
list and the elementals don't ever seem to hang around the zone. Soon as
the aggro list is clear, they immediately turn and head back to their
guard stations. 

Now, however, if you don't have a key, you have a new problem. The zone
tunnel is underwater. On the other side of the zone line is more tunnel
leading to a locked door. If you don't have an EB item, and have no key,
you could be in trouble at this point. Smaller races can, with practice,
wiggle through the gaps near the door fairly quickly, so you might get
out. If you're a barb, troll, ogre, I think you're fucked as to making
it out alive into Paineel without a rogue or keyholder to open the door.

That said, however, you can do the zone twice trick. Zone out to clear
aggro, and upon finishing loading, immediately turn around, zone back
in, swim up for air and climb out into the safe area again. The mobs
have forgotten you and you can bandage in peace. :-)
