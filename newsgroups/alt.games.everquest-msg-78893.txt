Darklet, others have told you the difference between a "light blue" and
a "blue" already. But in case you were wondering how to tell a *low*
blue from a *high* blue, there IS a way. (Well, at least at the low and
mid levels there's a way. Beyond fifty pretty much anything that's not
green will kick your ass. Heh.) You may or may not have noticed that the
specific con message you get when considering a blue mob is not always
the same. Different levels of "blue" will give a hint as to how high
they are with the con message you receive.

Go to this page and print it out and post it by your computer. I *still*
have this printed out by mine.


For example, if you are between the levels of 15 and 24, when you con a
creature you'll get one of the many following messages:

-6 or less, Green, looks like a reasonably safe opponent 
-5, Blue, You would probably win this fight .. it's not certain though 
-4, Blue, looks quite risky, but might be worth a try 
-3, Blue, looks quit risky 
-2 and -1, Blue, looks kind of dangerous 
same, Black/White, he appears to be quite formidable. 
+1 and +2, Yellow, looks like quite a gamble 
+3 or more, Red, what would you like your tombstone to say 

Now the low end of this *might* be outdated with the addition of the
light blues, but I've found it to me mostly reliable and a great help in
target selection, and also in determining Jabober's level for all you
pet classes. These sets of messages change as you go through the levels,
so check back as you level up and be aware of that.
