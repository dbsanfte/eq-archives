Sometimes this is a case of someone who honestly doesn't know an
item's "market value". Other times, it's someone hoping the buyer
doesn't know the value and will offer far more than it's worth.

It's not the "make offer" in itself that I hate. It's the ones who say
"make offer", then bitch at you for trying to rip them off if they
think your offer is too low.
