Jealousy? How comical to think that such an emotion could cloud a technical
issue.

LCD screens aren't as good as CRT's for a great number of reasons, poor
performance in gaming is one of them. I've used both, have the resources to
pick any model I want, and I choose a quality CRT.

You are more than welcome to enjoy an LCD for your usage needs, it doesn't
meet my needs, and I would be doing myself a disservice if I simply didn't
use an LCD for reasons of jealousy.

I notice you don't say anything about the somewhat vexing issue about high
resolution....say 1600x1200. Can your LCD screen do that?

Running an LCD screen outside it's native resolution creates a whole host of
problems, irrespective of the lack of "response time" and image quality
issues, that I have seen first-hand.
