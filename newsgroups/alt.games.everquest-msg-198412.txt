Came back after a year and a half absence because of the free 7 day account
reactivation.

After leveling my guy up to level 10 I've just lost interest.  Just seems like
the same old same old.  Find creature, kill creature, get xp.  I think I could
really get into the PvP servers but with so many people having played for years
I'd get my ass handed to me over and over.  I think i'll just join up for the
next new thing so I can start on a level playing field.

BTW: I dont have anything worth giving away.  Level 10 ranger, all pine scout
armor with some ruined gnoll leather in bank.  10 PP or so total.

Mike
