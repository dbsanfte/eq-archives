Scale of wolf.  It is somewhat faster than Spirit of Wolf, but it drops if
you go into combat.  I assume druids get it, shaman do.  There's also the
super long recycle time, Spirit of Cheetah, which is much faster, but does
not last long at all.  Again, I don't know for sure that Druids get that
one.
