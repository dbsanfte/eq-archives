Well - a kitty BL gets visible pieces
that are equivalent to the quest armor
in Shadeweave - way less AC (naturally)
than bard lambent, +hp on many.  The 
cloak/shoulders/face were all better than
what the bard got.  The belt was way better-
the equivalent of Spider Fur (ac 10 and 
+40 hp).  Same range slot, same ear/neck.

A pair of polished steel ulak lookalikes.

The bard (all extra points in Sta) had
less hp and better AC (604 ac) the BL, who
had 800+hp and 558 AC

The bard has better weapons as far as
dmg/delay - but the ac/mana/hp on the BL
weapons is nice.

Also - the BL does not have his pet summons.

BTW - it's nice to finally see what the
quested BP in shadeweaver looks like - 
pretty cool - I got everything else for
my BL alt (who is 25 btw, and has 
better hp/ac only because of some low
end twinking.  Same weapons, worse range.)

Either they'll fix the missing pet summons,
or I'll just have to farm a bit of cash and
buy the 22 one <shrug>
