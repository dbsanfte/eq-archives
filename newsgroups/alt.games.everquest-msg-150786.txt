This was from the notes.

On the Display tab of the options window you will now find four
options regarding particle effects.  The first three, listed under
Spell Particles are Near Clip Plane, Density and Opacity.  These are
the options for controlling the new particle effects.  They will not
change the old particle effects.  The old particles are controlled
using the Other Particles option.

Note on Near Clip Plane:  This option chooses how close to you
particles cease to be visible.  So Near allows particles to be seen
right up to the character.  Farthest will clip out particles near the
character and only show those at the 'farthest' distance.

Note on Opacity:  This feature works at all settings for cards that
support TnL.  For other cards setting Opacity to 0% will turn off the
effects and any other setting will show them fully.

We'll leave it up to you to discover which spells have the new
particles...

Not sure if this helps.  I can't try it out now, at work. :((
  Seems that not all spells have the new effects but I do remember seeing
SoW screen shots that did.
