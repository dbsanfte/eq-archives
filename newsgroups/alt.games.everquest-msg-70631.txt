I personally think it is silly that people have to pay to use software at
all. The software itself has NO intrinsic value. The money you pay is not
paid to 'own it' and there is no guarantee with what you do get.
Read a Microsoft EULA lately?
I waffles on for a few paragraphs about how you are only paying for a
license to use the software and that it remains the property of MS.
It then goes on to say that it has no warranty of any kind and that if it
works at all its more a fluke than by design.
Strangely some people still choose to pay the license fee.
