}Ok... let me be more spcific about the problem with Beastlords in PvP
}combat.  My pet can attack the player all he likes, but the moment I die, my
}pet goes away.  So all the player has to do is kill me (and I'm not all that
}hard to kill) and he's won the fight.  The great advantage to having a pet
}is that I can stand back and let him fight and keep my hp up, while I heal
}him.  Don't get me wrong... I don't die easily... but I should be able to
}take players at my own level, and I can't.  Maybe I'm playing the class
}wrong.  Maybe my gear isn't good enough, I know it's really not very good.
}Oh well.  I'm going to make some money I think, then I'll go buy myself some
}better gear and try the PvP game some more.

Here's a plan for ya.  When fighting a PC, you know they know that, so 
they'll probably ignore the pet and come after you.  So aggro kite.  Sic 
pet on them and run away while the pet nips their heels.  It would help if 
you can find a way to be faster than them... what level do BSTs get sow?
