There isn't much hardcore Roleplaying done in EQ. There are so many
people playing (up to 2800 on a single server), that very few know how
or are able to properly RP. You can and will find RPers, but
understand that the majority of players you will come into contact
with will not be in "character". 

What you do get is an intense and extremely addictive character
building experience. New skills and powers are dangled in front of you
like a carrot, and the game world is incredibly rich and diverse. I am
an old AD&D player and I love EQ. 

Sony/Verant just released a $9.99US version you can buy of the
original game. I believe it comes with a free month of play. I would
recommend picking up the first expansion (which includes the original
game) Ruins of Kunark and offers 1 month free play. It sells for
around $30.00US. So for $10.00-30.00US  what have you got to lose?

I must warn you though. It isn't called Ever-Crack for nothing. Once
you start playing it may totally consume you. :-P

Cheers
