I know you said you did not like waiting for X to spawn, but killling Cuburt in
the Qeynos Aqueducts is a great newbie quest.  The spawn time for his PHs is
only about 45 seconds, so it is fast killing....reward is nice to, if you get
the bloody dress and it turns in for the earring, it is a +3 Int item...

Regards,
John
