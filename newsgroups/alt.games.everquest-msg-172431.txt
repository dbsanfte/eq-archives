	Or the flip side, allows experienced players with more RL cash then

	very easy to find in the likes of EQ).

	I haven't bought anything on line, yet, but when I weigh my RL time
	vs the reward, it's very tempting.  Paying $30 RL cash for something
	that enhances my enjoyment of the game, but would take me hours or
	days to get myself in game would be a huge bargain.  $30 for many
	people is lunch.

	If something takes me 16 hours to get in game, I've effectively
	payed nearly $1000 RL cash for it.  If I had fun while I got the
	item, that would be ok, but SOE has gone far, far out of their way
	to make the time required to get a particular item as little fun as
	they possibly could.

: <3> It creates in-game logjams as farmers try to monopolize spawns in

	RL cash or in game cash, this is already a problem.  The allure of
	real cash isn't going to change it much.  The worst such "logjams"
	are in places like RM, where two dozen lvl 65 druids all fight over
	10 green HGs, for the pp not the real cash.

	EQ is all about bending over and taking it up the arse.  There is no
	way to avoid that, but at least the RL cash auctions can offer a
	little bit of lube to those who can afford it.
