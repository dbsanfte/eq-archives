It's not uber, but it's not a piece of crap, either.

More RAM and a better video card are probably all you need. I hear
that GeForce2 with 64 megs are absurdly cheap now (absurd to me,
anyhow, who bought mine back when it was over $400), and RAM is even
cheaper. 

I'd recommend replacing the video card first.
