     I am looking to buy a computer to play EQ2 and have been
investigating the different computer companies that will build a
computer for you.  I do not have a high income and so was shooting for
something from $1000 to $1500.  I am curious if people could give me
some information on different computer building companies and if they
have had good or bad experiences with them.

     I have done some research (i.e. read the EQ2 forums :)) and have
read different opinions of Dell and Gateway.  I read where someone  was
unhappy with Dell because they could only replace the parts of a Dell
computer with other specially made Dell parts.

      On the other hand, with Gateway, I have read where someone was
unhappy with Gateway because they would create a computer for them with
parts that were refurbished but were mislead  into thinking they were
new.

      I checked out the Gateway site and liked the prices and the load
of 700 watt power suppliers in their computers but am nervous about how
trustworthy they may be.

     I very briefly checked out the Dell site and their computers seem
to be much higher priced and have power supplies that are significantly
lower than 700 watts, even with those higher prices.

     In regards to Alienware: I only checked out their site briefly
because I read different people's posts making reference to it but I
haven't  hear much about Alienware in general.

     So I am curious if anybody who has had experience with one or more
of these companies can post if they are happy with their computer and
their customer service there.  I really miss EQ2 and would like to get a
computer to play it (not looking for Vanguard-ish specs.)   The only
thing I have really decided against right now is an HP (I checked the HP
store for a HP "Gaming" computer for roughly $1800 that only had a 300
watt power supply ??)

     Also, the computer I was looking at on Gateway allowed an upgrade
to a 7900gt video card and while I have  read negative opinions of this
card in the past on the EQ2 forums, people seem to be ok with this card
now.  Can anybody tell me if this would be a good card to play EQ2 on ?

     Thank you very much for whatever information you can offer.  Money
is tight for me and I would really like to deal with a company that I
can trust.

Thanks !
