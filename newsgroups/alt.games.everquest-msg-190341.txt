One of the top 10 sellers at playerauctions posted a message on their
board last Thursday showing the contents of an email he had just
received.  The email stated that the sender had millions of plat
available on most of the EQ servers.  He provided a list of those
servers.  $150 per 100k in blocks of 500k or 1,000k.  He also offered
to deliver the plat up front on the first purchase.  The email also
stated that one million plat could be generated on any EQ server in
about 1 hrs time.  He warned that one should act fast because  the
patch coming up on April 1 might elimate his ablilites to provide
plat.   That message was deleted within 30 minutes by the admin at
playerauctions.  A second  person posted a copy of the previous
message with the senders name & email address removed.  That second
post was likewise deleted almost immedately by the admin.  

I don't have a level 65 character, but I truely doubt that a whole
guild of level 65 characters could generate $1 million plat in one
hour. 

Looking at both sites where Yantis sells his plat, I've noticed that
he's  been selling at least one million plat everyday on my server for
the last 30 days.  The word out is he's not buying plat from anyone.
It makes one wonder how he managed to get so much plat.  On my server,
there were many days prior to March 1 when he had less than 100k
available for sale.  Now he has over 2 million available everyday.
I'm not saying that Yantis is the only one selling cheap plat.  It
seems to me that 5 or 6 people like Yantis pumping over 10 million of
new plat into the EQ economy on a daily basis has to have an impact.
