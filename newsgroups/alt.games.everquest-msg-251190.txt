> 1. What is/are flags/keys?

Short and simple explination:
Flags - After you kill a flagging mob (PoP bosses), you hail the planar
projection that pops and get a yellow messege. Hurrah, you're flagged.
Depending on the flag you can now enter new zones are do new
encounters... or do nothing because you're missign another flag linked
to that one.
Keys - Typically you run around and collect items, combine them in some
bag and get a key. Keys give you access to new areas/zones. EI: You
need to loot a medaillion off of a froglok hunter and froglok forager
in TT to combine them into the OS key.

> 2 To where should I aim to get flagged first?

First, wait until 65, second, PoJ. Then find a guide.

> 3 How do I get flag for any particualr zone?

For PoP, kill a boss mob of a certain zone, and in most cases after
recieving the flag you can enter another zone. Killing grummus lets you
into CoD, killing Terris Thule AND Bertox lets you into PoTorment.

> 4 A brief explanation of "mini raids"

Small raid, like... 2 groups. EI: BoT flag in PoS. You need to kill a
bunch of 2 groupable mobs and gather some items.

> 5 Any other basic, "next step forward" kind of tips.

Get to 65 =/.

Yeah, that was horrible but it's past midnight, so feh.
