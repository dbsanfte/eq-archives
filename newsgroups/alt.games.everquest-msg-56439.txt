Same here, on "lost" corpse.  and the guide actually was able to tell me
what to do in tell even.  I was an eqnewbie at the time and thought to
drag your corpse you had to target it first.  I died in Crushbone, and
my corpse wound up inside a tree.  I did a /loc before i died, and
looked, and couldn't even get to that location, oculd get close but not
to the location.
