I'm doing AA til run3, maybe get regen3 too for baroness at 56 if I'm
sufficiently bored, but I really don't plan on doing any of the arch or
class AA til 60 (though I really want innate camo and SCM3)

I want run3 though because I spend about 75% of my exping time in dungeons,
and run3 would help my survival rate when the shit hits the fan.

Mostly I'm just tired of the normal exp grind though.

If you're a 'normal' (read: gimp quad-or-nothing) druid, then you probably
have no use for any AA until 60.  Also depends on guild status, if you're in
a more raid oriented guild then keep leveling (or run3 if you get left
behind a lot =p)
