Yeah, LDoN was the reason I kept playing EQ as long as I did.  It
solved so many problems with EQ... no long camps, no "you have to be
online 3 hours to get anything done", no "you have to try to get your
corpse out of impossible spot or lose all your gear".  You have to
keep moving or fail, no sitting in one spot handling boring pull after
pull.

I was with you till here... EQ was fun but just too static.  WoW has
great storyline, great graphics,  fun action, you're always on the
move, never sitting in one camp.  Most of the zones have a great "zone
feel"... you can almost feel the sweat dripping off your brow in
Stranglethorn, and you pull on a coat when you are in Winterspring.  

EQ2... only played briefly.  Liked the voice stuff but that could
drive you nuts after a while.  Played like a slideshow on a 3 year old
alienware box.  The mechanism for "linked mobs" was absurd.  Had the
same "sorry, you gotta group to do anything" attitude that EQ started
with.  

Vanguard... sounds like it's going to be even more "you gotta group to
do anything".  Plus no instances, so enjoy the trainers and griefers
coming thru as you try to do raids and quests. I'm not sure Brad has
learned anything from his EQ experience.
