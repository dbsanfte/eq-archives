Mezzing is great.  When you pull a group of six, or the puller grabs
some adds on their way back, the mezzer could save the group.  Refresh
(breeze upgrade) can keep the group's spells flying a lot longer than
without it.

It is pretty easy for an enchanter to get into a group that is handling
stuff to hard for them.  At that point, mezzes become useless and they
become mana monkeys (tm).  If you don't want want to be a buff-bot for
the rest of the group, conjuror might be a better choice.
