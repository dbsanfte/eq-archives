I would recommend buying a Runed Bone Fork.  Range slot item with SV
COLD+10 SV FIRE+10 SV MAGIC+10.  Cost should be 800-1000pp.  Although
being lvl 46 or 47 mobs are going to land spells on you every time. 
Level is much more important than the resist gear you use.  Also you
are weilding two aoe weapons - that would be a very bad thing to use
in fear.
