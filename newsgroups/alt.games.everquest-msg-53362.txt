Again, how the hell do you know this?  Verant hasn't said anything
about it, and I certainly don't see anymore people going LD than
normal.  (As a point of reference, I go on 30-40 person raids at least
3 nights a week with my guild, and as someone in charge of organizing
the groups, I'm very aware of who is going LD.)  I have seen problems
where the login server is congested, but haven't seen that in at least
two week.  
I have seen NOTHING to indicate problems on Verant's end.  I have seen
several guildies who have started to use their dial-up rather than
cable for raids because they are less likely to go LD.  I strongly
suspect that the problems are in several cable/DSL providers, rather
than Verant.  Before you start saying that they're using different
providers, it would help to know that most dial-up providers buy their
ports from one of three wholesalers, that most DSL companies are
reselling RBOC services backhauled, and that most cable companies
aggregate entire regions.  (Yes, I have some fairly in-depth technical
knowledge of the systems in question, and know where the problems most
likely lie.  Both cable and DSL are severely over-subscribed, and
neither are investing much money in their networks now.)
Generally, if there is a problem with Verant, the entire server or at
least an appreciable percentage will see problem.  Raids will get ugly
due to critical people going LD, zone populations will plummet, people
will start complaining.  In the past week I've seen several raids with
at least 50 characters and nobody complaining.  I've hunted in all of
the main 50+ dungeons without issue, and except for isolated incidents
caused by my ISP, have seen no problems with ping time, packet-loss,
or lag.
I certainly don't want to become a VAK, but just because you're having
problems doesn't mean that Verant is having problems.  (Full
disclosure:  I had terrible connection problems after 9-11, and tried
several different ISPs, and spent probably 20 hours troubleshooting,
fully convinced that it was Verant.  It wasn't until after my main ISP
came back and I was able to access a sniffer that I discovered that my
router has a NAT bug affecting UDP packets.  I apologized to their
tech people who worked with me.)
