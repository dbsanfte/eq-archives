I think its

AC = [(Base AC + AC of armor)* (agi mod)]+AC Buffs
AC doesn't go up at different rates depending on anything else when you
cast a buff, so it clearly isn't being multiplied by some variable.

Defense is seperate from AC, and determines the frequency at which
you get hit.  Similarly, Dodge, Parry, and Riposte also give you chances
to avoid attacks, but these are not relative to the mob's attack score.

I haven't done real testing, but its not a very simple thing.  Again, here
is
how I -think- it works.

Imagine a long line travelling along a gradual slope up, then moving
into a steep climb for a ways, then back to a gradual slope.
           _______
_____/

Length of the first line is dependant on the level of the mob doing the
hitting.. or rather its Attack rating.  The first bit, the Attacks almost
always
land for full value.  Here, your AC just doesn't do much at all.  Then you
go into
the interesting section, where Attacks are thwarted by AC to some extent,
and the further along the slope you go, the better the effect, fairly
dramatically.
Then you pass the steep part, and most attacks do relatively little
damage...
and more AC doesn't do much to further decrease damage rate, even in large

chunks.

So, AC is important if and only if the difference in AC happens to move
you
at least in part within the steep part of the slope.  If your AC is
hopelessly
below the target slope for a given mob, then increasing it by 50 points
isn't
going to matter much at all.  You'll take almost full damage from every
shot.
If your AC is already towering way above the target slope, then that extra

50 points also isn't going to matter much, you are going to be taking
minimal
damage output from the mob either way.  But if you are low but almost to
the
slope, that AC pushes you into the range where you see some protection.
If
you aren't out of the range yet, then the 50 points pushes you to the top
and
along it for a while.  In both these cases, you only get part of the AC
benefit,
in particular the guy at the high end of the slope would benefit just as
much from
say a 30 AC boost.  IF you are square in the middle of the slope, though,
you
get full effect out of every point of AC you can come up with.

See above.  If your caster has tissue paper and is facing a substantial
mob,
then giving him two ply paper isn't going to matter.  If your tank is
wearing
three inch battleship decking, then putting a layer of plywood on the top
of
it isn't going to matter either, nothing is getting in anyway.  But if
he's wearing
a leather jacket and you give him some padding to wear underneath, you
are going to see him taking only half the beating he did before.

Casters facing whimpy mobs get benefit from AC boost.  Hard Core Tanks
facing big meat grinder mobs get benefit from AC boost.  Rangers facing
mobs slightly more dangerous than the whimpy caster mobs get benefit...
Its very situational, really.

Now add to that the fact that casters have very little HP anyway, and
my personal conclusion is that its almost never a good idea to cast this
major mana hog on them.  It might suck away some of the damage that
green to them mobs will do, but if the situation is serious enough to
warrant worrying about doing this, then the mobs are almost certainly
also too high in attack value to be bothered by their AC even if you boost

it up with Aegis/Bulwark of Faith level AC buff.

Even that is a hit or miss situation, twinked out lowbies have AC that
puts them up off the slope already, and why are non twinked lowbies
getting PLed?  Funny set of morals that will let them take your time
and mana but not your 100pp to buy a set of banded
