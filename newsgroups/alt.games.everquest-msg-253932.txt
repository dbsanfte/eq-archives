I think communism is an exceellent idea, too bad its never been tried.

I think much the same of socialism.

And capitalism.

Nobody seems to use these systems in pure form.

Actually, to be really honest, I think capitalism would suck in its pure 
form.  And I think communism overestimates human nature, its little 
wonder its never really worked (but I don't see how trying makes people 
evil).  Socialism, for all people rage against it, seems to be the 
leavening every system needs to come close to working in terms of 
keeping people productive while also keeping them all alive.  The USof A 
is a heavily socialized capitalist society, and as an aside, its also 
not democratic, its a republic with democratic inputs.

Funny how we tell ourselves its a capitalist democracy when a strong 
arguement could be made that its a socialist republic
