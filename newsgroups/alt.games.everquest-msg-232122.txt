Ya the idea of socialist economic theory has been around for ages.
There is a good reason why the political regimes based on those theories
crumble.
A sale only takes place based on the Buyers perceived value.
The buyer could care less about the sellers costs , value of time etc..
A product with high costs and taking a long time to make will never sell if
the buyer has no desire for it.
A product with low costs and high value to the buyer will sell as long as
price is below the buyers value.
A seller that gets a much profit as possible can live off, reinvest, make
new products etc.
A seller that devalues itself goes out of business.
No motive no growth then stagnation and death.

As far as the bazaar goes. I never worry about the price undercutters.
They are never around long.
The ones that do worry me are the one that always seem to have 10,000 units
for sale
