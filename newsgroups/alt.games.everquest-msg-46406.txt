4-5k would be a good price on Bristlebane.
3k should guarantee a sale.
Not sure where you are but if Heavy war lances are going for 1k there, I'm
on the wrong server :ï¿½)

Word of advise, stick an alt in EC (or NFP, wherever the bazaar is held on
your server) and give him the lance. That way you can sit there for as long
as you like trying to sell without having to keep journeying  back there.
I'd say the reason you haven't sold it yet is just time, few things go
straight away, unless they are sold very cheap (sell it for 1k and I
guarantee it'll be bought by a trader whole sell it on for a profit)
