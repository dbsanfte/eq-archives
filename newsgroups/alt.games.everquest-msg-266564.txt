My dog is similar to the dogs that have inhabited the seemier sides of 
the internet since time immemorial, a member of that rare species of dog 
which is capable of burning copies of CDs, of not merely playing EQ but 
using the shark killing exploit to generate vast amounts of pp, of 
selling EQ characters... not that my dog ever did any of those things, 
but he did allow his children to play EQ on his account, in clear 
violation of the EULA, claiming that this rule only applies to humans.

I, personally, would never ever tamper with a fine generic box of wine, 
which would naturally be a crime, if not against man, against Bacchus. 
My dog, as is typical of his species, professed not to care about such 
trivialities nor grandiousities, as a god is no more than a dog spelled 
backwards.

It does puzzle me how he managed to procure the alum, without my backing.
