It's easier to get aggro back with a faster 1hder, big damage does hold
aggro well but it can hurt if you lose it and suffer missing streak at the
same time, this also counts when building aggro, a bunch of slow misses to
start is not going to make you a the friend of any of the big damage dealers
in the group.
I never much liked the Wurmy but there is no denying it's effectiveness in
dishing damage.

I'd say lammy/centi combo for the most part and use a big hitting 2hder when
in the jam role.
Yes he didn't mention 2hders in his post, which is odd as the subject says
2hs :�)
In the case of 2hdr's I can't recommend Felhammer enough if you're on a
budget.
I still use mine and gave up both Zealots Incarnadine and
Doljonijiarnimorinar in favour of it.
You won't proc it till 50 tho'
If you're not on a budget I wouldn't know where to begin :�)
