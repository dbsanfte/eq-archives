For a while, I had an Erudite mage who spoke with a real cornpone
southern accent ("Why don't y'all group with me? We'll rassle those orcs
plenty, sho'enough.") I started my halfling druid Rosewhite with a
Yiddish accent, but she has become decidedly Midwestern (although still a
bit of a yenta.) My ranger... he is the somewhat crazed loner type who
doesn't talk much.
