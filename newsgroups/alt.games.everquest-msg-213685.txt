Why Iksar?  The exp penalty is annoying to deal with, do you really think the
extra regen is worth the tradeoff?  I'll grant you that the other Iksar issues
aren't a real problem; faction is a non issue anymore, and not being able to
wear plate only matters if you are running a plate class.

Unless you are twinking with enough cash to include a Lute of the Howler, Vah
Shir bards have a substantial advantage, in that they can quest a primary slot
equippable string instrument before they hit level 6.  I can't think of any
advantage any other race of bards have, save for the fact that Vah Shir must be
agnostic, while normal bards get the widest range of religion choices in the
game.  Starting non KOS to COV might be a treat...
