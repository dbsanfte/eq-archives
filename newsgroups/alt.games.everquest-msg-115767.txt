A few days ago I was in EC (only LV8 at the time) and I got lucky and
summoned a pet that conned yellow to me (and from how he acted and fought he
might have been 2 levels above me...a high yellow, kind of like the rare
green pets).  We were doing fine with him taking on 1 or 2 cons that were
even to me, while I fought another, or him soloing a yellow and a blue while
I fought the even con.  I eventually started to get low on HP (about 50%)
and almost out of mana.  So I went over to the inns near orc 2 to sit and
rest.
    That's when the problem started, my pet saw something, took off and
attacked it.  He killed that, then spotted something else and killed it too,
being close enough for me to get EXP at the same time.  I didn't mind this,
but guessed he was getting low on health.  The stupid bones didn't
understand /pet calm down, /pet back off, /pet follow me, or anything else I
tried to tell it.  He just kept on his rampage killing anything that got
within seeing distance.  I didn't mind the easy EXP, but was afraid of him
eventually dieing after trying to take on a few at a time (he was having no
problem soloing one after another that were even to me, or even yellow to
me, probably even or blue to him).
    After nearly 3-4 blue bubbles EXP from him, he went on an ego trip and
thought he could take on 2 Kodiaks, both of which conned red to me.  He did
get one of them down to about 30-40% HP before he died.  I decided I wasn't
going to act like him and fight two mobs above my level at the same time,
plus being red there was no way I could hit them anyway, and they'd resist
most of my spells.  I tried to run, but was encumbered (still dubious to
merchants other than the ones in the EC tunnel).  Eventually the two Kodiaks
caught up with me and killed me.
    Later that evening I was in EC at an orc camp, and again kept summoning
even con pets, with a yellow or two.  Problem was I noticed the lower level
pets were the smarter ones.  The even or yellow ones were STUPID.  I
couldn't get them to attack the orcs.  When one would die (because he'd just
stand there and not fight back) I'd summon another, and if they were blue to
me, they turned out to be smarter and would actually fight when told to do
so, and were surprisingly less likely to die.  When I gave a pet (one of the
higher cons) some of the lore items that weren't being looted, just to get
rid of the corpses, the item seemed to have a "pet int - 250, pet wis - 250"
stat effect on them.
    Has anyone else had similar experiences?  Like having your pet go on a
killing rampage WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION, and refuse to listen to you when
you tried to get him to stop?  Or sometimes you buy/sell to a merchant and
then leave and the pet is standing by the merchant as if buying or selling
on their own, then runs after you?
    The only nice part was the nearly 1 bubble EXP (3-4 blue) that I got for
free while medding, and that dieing only made me have to memorize spells
again (about 20-30 seconds) and go from Nektulos back to EC, that and I lost
a great partner (who just had to show off his combat skills, until he had to
show off his ego as well).
