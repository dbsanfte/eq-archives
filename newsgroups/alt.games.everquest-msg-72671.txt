Nah, that's ok .. every caster class has DD's. And grav flux isn't exactly the
class defining spell of a wizard, not? As far as I know, all chanter nukes also
cast dogslow and taunt more than a wizards normal DD's.

That was stooped and I ignore that. Shit .. I didnt :) let's not go down there.
I did not ask for an *enhancement* of the classes. More of a cleanup. Both,
regrowth and direct heal are a big plus.

Nobody said this. The VERANT thing is just because *some* at verant do
read newsgroups .. I hoped to catch their attention. Sometimes you do that
best with something as boring as 'VERANT'.

: Anyways, Druids get UV in one of their upper level wolf forms, and shaman

That's something I missed.

That's total blah. Slow is a class defining component of the shaman. If you
brign up that, then I'd have been asking for teleportation for shamen, yet
I have not (and would not .. that's a druid thing).

I'm not much about fair .. it's more about sensible.

Yeah, and shamen are living in high tech computer offices. Read a few books
about native red indians or any other old folk with shamen. You'll be very
hardpressed to find them in extremely domesticated, high civilized
civilisations :) Shamen are as earthbound as druids with their trees.

: has to do more with druids than Shaman. Not saying it doesnt have anything

Just because they named it eagle? Name it Spirit of the Earthghost and it's
more shaman. BTW: the name itself 'Spirit' is way more shaman named thatn
druid. The spirit world *is* what shamen devled in :)

: to do with them, but druids make more sense.

Disagreement.
