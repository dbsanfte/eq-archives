Perhaps a wizard (IMHO easy because of just using spells, and thats it)
Or a druid (IMHO girls like treehugging hippies, so a woodelf dr00d would 
be fine :-) )
Or even a cleric, just let her concentrate on healing others, and hiking 
along for the XP, and getting to know the game)

Hope this helps (a bit),
