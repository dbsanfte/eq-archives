    They are making that change, so some luck there. Although I can't see
anyone that just wants XP settling for anything less than PoP-level XP. I'm
hoping the next expansion, the dungeon-based one, comes soon. That, if done
correctly, would really help things tremendously.

    Oh, god. The stairs. That'll be just crazy. For those who haven't been
to Tactics, imagine a huge staircase with landings. At the bottom, there's
another very short staircase up to a dead end alcove. In Tactics, the
"out-of-pit" zone out is in that alcove, and the zone-in area is on one of
the landings. So not only does every train to zone nail people at zone-in,
but even after the train has been zoned, all the mobs in the train start
slowly walking back home - up the stairs and right through the zone-in.
Given that each of the mobs in the area hits for 800+ and usually quads,
it's one awful surprise for someone that's zoned in, been there a minute,
and actually feels safe.
