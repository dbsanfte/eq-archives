    Melbourne, Australia actually. In fact, Brunswick, where such behavior
is quite acceptable.

    I agree with that - if I had the time again I'd sign up all over again.
I just think it's... unfortunate... that one bad corporate decision can mean
I lose contact with a couple of friends. If I were designing a MMORPG today,
it would have to have as much longevity built in as possible, and naturally
sort people into geographically coherent groups. I know it's kinda cool to
be in a group with one guy from texas, one from dublin and one from japan,
but ultimately I think people would be better served by meeting people
closer to where they lived.

    Maybe I was just spoiled by the old local BBS thing...

Cheers,
James
