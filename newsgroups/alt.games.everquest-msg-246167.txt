Personally I think trolls should be rarer than most races - who in a
sane state of mind would willingly associate with them?  They're big,
stupid and would sooner eat you than help you.  Probably smell bad,
too.  Ogres are of course much the same, and Iksar not far behind
(they're not as stupid though).  Dark Elves also ought to be rare,
since it's a rare Dark Elf who can be trusted even by other Dark
Elves.
