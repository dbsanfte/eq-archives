Well, except that they dont stop developing once the product is out the
door. Theyre always cooking up something - not counting expansions, which
you'd think would be covered by the expansions purchase price.

EQ doesnt use much bandwidth, you're correct. Multiply it by 450k players,
and thats a lot of bandwidth... I havent played Diablo 2, only 1. But
Battlenet probably uses *much* less bandwidth. Much of the bandwidth for D2
is passed peer-to-peer, that is, Battlenet doesnt do much beyond setting up
games. I understand D2 has some sort of play mode where your character is
stored on their servers. Even then, I doubt Battlenet does much beyond
spawning mobs or something. Probably much is offloaded to peer-to-peer data
passing.

But even if I'm completely wrong with how D2 works (quite possible), its
still comparing Quake servers to, uh, EQ servers... :) From checking ot
Blizzard's site, I know that only 8 people play D2 at once. Thats peanuts.
You'd be lucky to find only 8 people in most zones...

Now I'm not saying EQ doesnt make a profit on our monthly fees... They
probably do, and its probably quite a bit! But with ongoing development, CS
(ha!), GMs (haha!), servers capable of handling 3k simultaneous users in
dozens of different areas all while keeping track of bajillions of mobs and
such, you should be able to see how it shouldnt just be free...
