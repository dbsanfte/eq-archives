Well, in general, it's not merchants who pay out the big bucks for cool
items, it's players. So look for the stuff *players* want to buy.

Excellent Sabertooth Hides, used in cultural tailoring, go for ~25-50pp
each. "A Sarnak Courier" drops an insta-click invis to animals ring, goes
for about 10kpp maybe. But he's kinda rare, and the ring is his rare drop,
so don't count on it, but don't ignore him if he's up.

If you're xping in Kurn's Tower, save all the bone chips. You could easily
get 3 or 4 stacks of bone chips in no time. Not big bucks, but it's still
cash.

If you just want to farm greens, you might think about the spiderlings
in the Bonebinder Warrens of FoB. Spiderling silks go for a few plat
each.
