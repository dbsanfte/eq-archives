Anyone outside your group can't kill steal and take an item. Within a
group you have the lotto option to randomly award items but you still
get people asking for something.

When I logged on last night the survey came up asking me what I thought
of Station Exchange and if I wanted to participate in it. Funny thing
is the survey is bugged!! Only two of the 6 answer boxes had text in
them. Still, the viable answers were "I am against it" to the question
"What do you think of Station Exchange" and "No" to the question "Do
you want to participate in it" I filled in the survey anyway!!
