    Well, I've always been a HP cleric. The funny thing is that while almost
all the other clerics in the guild now use Khura's over BAotR for the extra
150 HPs, I still use BAotR for the 6/tick mana regen. Whether I had Khura's
on or not I'd still self-CH after munching three mods (when I'm able to
self-heal), so I don't see why they need it. Then again I also have yet to
die when two Zethons come to camp at once and everyone takes 3000 AoE
damage. ;-)

    My mana preservation focus (Obsidian Necklace) will reduce the cost on
EL, and not on CH, so the cost comparison for me becomes 400 on CH versus
479 for EL (10% reduction). EL casts exactly in the time it takes me to miss
a bash when the plant starts to cast its unresistable 450 DD spell, and when
the spell lands. So it never gets interrupted, giving me more time to
actually kill the thing. The damage output of the lotus is weak enough,
between slow melee, interrupted spells, and fully resisted spells/spells
that do no damage (Immobilize) that I can wait until just under three bubs
of health before casting. At that point it's almost a complete heal, and a
lucky crit on the heal would make it a complete heal.

    Huge HPS at relatively fast speed. When some of the mobs we pull come
in, a bridge heal is needed to keep the tank alive against an unslowed mob
until a CH can land. This is the best spell available for that job. It's
just ungodly expensive mana-wise. But we have T-rods anyways, right?

    Keep looking. Right now it seems to be a drop only off one particular
Ssra boss. You're far more likely to get the 58 hammer, which is a standard
random spell drop in places like Ssra where you could have gotten BAotR.
