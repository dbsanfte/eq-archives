I never ever use this one.  Annoys the hell out of me when others do,
it's just so unnecessary.  Warriors don't send the group a tell
everytime they hit something, do they?

I do however use a /gsay macro for Complete Heal & Celestial Healing -
in both cases, other healers need to know I'm casting those (and the
spell recipient likes to know for his own peace of mind, since those
two don't make their effects known quickly).

Definitely never for the quick casting heals though.
