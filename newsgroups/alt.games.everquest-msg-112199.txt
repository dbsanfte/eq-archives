	In the pre-Soulbinder era, if you offered me $1,000,000 for the name of
the character who last bound me, I would not have been able to answer
truthfully.  The same is true for everyone I have ever spoke to on this issue.

	*NO ONE* formed friendships over Bind Affinity.  It was annoying for the
fighters, who had to waste playing time every time they changed where they
played, and it was annoying for the casters, who got bugged by /shouts and
/tells from fighters pleading for binds.  There were days when I had to log
out Venture because I'd moved from one continent to another and couldn't get a
bind -- that's unbelievably annoying, especially in a game you're paying to
play.

	Never mind the fact that since fighters are completely dependent upon
their equipment to function (whereas a naked caster retains 90% of his power),
the bind rules are completely unfair to begin with.

	You are completely off in the Twilight Zone on this issue.
