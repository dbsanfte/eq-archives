On a further note, as its always so frustrating for newbies (aren't we
all in some ways :-) when hearing acronyms constantly:-

KEI (or C3 a.k.a Clarity3 as I believe it's also known as) is short
for the name of the Enchanters level 60 spell - Kodiac's Endless
Intellect. Others have said some of the benefits, but it raises a
casters Mana pool and increases their mana regen rate SUBSTANCIALLY
:-)
Definitely level restricted, but I'm not sure what is the lower level
limit.
