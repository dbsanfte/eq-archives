You wouldn't believe (or maybe you would :) ) how many
groups have said 'Uh, no thanks' after I've explained to
them I don't kill 'real' animals. No bears. No wolves.
No elephants. As a ranger, I believe I shouldn't. And
I've never had to worry about being taken out by the
DSP wolves even when I was less than level 20.
