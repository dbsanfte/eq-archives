Semi true...

I plan on doing research, because I'd like to be able to research spells 
easier at higher levels, but I'd be a fool in my own opinion if I'd just 
let those training points go to waste, and start from scratch training. I 
WILL pump in 20 training points into research, but then I'd like to go 
for the training runes, to make my lvl 24 pet spell for instance......
(There have to be SOME players with high research skills to do the thing 
for other players ;-) )
And indeed I'd like to make some good money as well, since I'm only an 
lvl 13 necromancer with almost no money on my name, and still running in 
clloth gear, with a snakefang. (Thankfully my pet can hit for magic 
damage, so I can harvest wisps; Eruds crossing is REALLY deserted these 
days, I haven't seen a single other player on the Island or boat the 
entire wEek!! (Not that I'm complaining, heh)

But basicly I can go to the evil Gypsie's camp, sell off the Greater 
Lightstones, get the book of research from her, keep one, and sell the 
rest back to her for 8PP a piece?? And save four lightstones and hope 
She'll give me the other two research volumes ??

And the main book of research is a container, so it won't fit into a 
backpack?

Thanks again in advance,

Khalistro
