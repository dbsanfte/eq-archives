** Planes of Power Pre-Order Bonus **

If you pre-order the PoP expansion you will be able to purchase the
Planes of Power original soundtrack CD for just an additional $4.95.


*** Important Notice about Alternate Advancement ***

- When a character has 30 or more AA points, they will receive a red
message stating:

Warning: You are currently over the earned Advancement point limit of
30. Please spend some of your stored AA points. You will not be able
to earn further AA points until you have fewer than 30.  On October
21, 2002, all points over 30 in your AA pool will be deleted.

It seems appropriate that Advancement points earned prior to the
release of Planes of Power be used for abilities from earlier
expansions.   In addition, many of the Luclin abilities are
pre-requisites for Planes of Power abilities.  When the servers come
up on October 21st, all unused Alternate Advancement point pools over
30 will be wiped.


** New Spell Effects **

We are implementing a few new spell effects using our new particle
effects engine with this patch as a way of easing into the new system.
The new effects are faster and give you more control over how they
look.  We have changed the Display Options menu to accommodate these
new options.

On the Display tab of the options window you will now find four
options regarding particle effects.  The first three, listed under
Spell Particles are Near Clip Plane, Density and Opacity.  These are
the options for controlling the new particle effects.  They will not
change the old particle effects.  The old particles are controlled
using the Other Particles option.

Note on Near Clip Plane:  This option chooses how close to you
particles cease to be visible.  So Near allows particles to be seen
right up to the character.  Farthest will clip out particles near the
character and only show those at the 'farthest' distance.

Note on Opacity:  This feature works at all settings for cards that
support TnL.  For other cards setting Opacity to 0% will turn off the
effects and any other setting will show them fully.

We'll leave it up to you to discover which spells have the new
particles...


** Alternate Advancement **

- Beastlords now have access to the Mend Companion ability.
- Beastlords now have access to three unique class alternate
advancements.
- Permanent Illusion used with Wolf Form should no longer result in a
wolf tinted by the Enchanter's robe.
- Updated Finishing Blow - 
 "This ability gives you a chance to finish off an NPC that is below
10 percent health and fleeing with a single blow. The first level
works on NPC's below 50, the second on NPC's below 52, and the third
on NPC's below 54. (Non-Warriors must first train one level of Combat
Fury to use this ability.) "
- Improved Combat Fury for non-warriors to give more value to the
points spent after level 1.



** Spells **

- New Druid and Shaman heal spells are available.
- The "Your XXX Spell Has Worn Off" messages for DoT spells will now
go to the right character.
- Illusions that are of a character type that can't wear armor, such
as werewolf, will no longer cause the character to be naked when the
illusion drops.
- Fixed the Illusion wolf form swimming animation.
- Shaman and Beastlord Shrink spell has had its location restriction
removed.
- The outcasts of Echo Caverns have deciphered new magics that allow
Dark Knights to channel the essence of terror into their enemies
minds.  While their initial findings have proven very powerful, rumors
exist of even greater magics that might channel the nightmares of
Terris Thule herself into the minds of mortals.  Where that power
might be found is not yet known.


** Items **

- Items that grant bonuses to bandage skill should be working now.
- Guise of the Hunter no longer makes the user appear to be naked.
- Validus Custodus Battle Axe no longer looks like a bard mandolin
when equipped by a pet.  


** PvP Servers and Gameplay **

- The recent resist changes have been adjusted for PvP.  They will not
be exactly as they were prior to the resist change, but they should be
reasonable now.  Please let us know if you feel they need further
adjustment.
- Player characters will no longer lose experience in the Arena areas
on the Sullon Zek server.
- A player character can no longer tell his pet to attack another
player's horse when not on a PvP area or in a duel.
- Kael, Skyshrine, and Thurgadin on Sullon Zek no longer have the
newbie protection code active.
- Players should once again be able to use level-restricted clickable
buffs on the Sullon Zek server.


** Pets **

- Improved Beastlord pets to scale more reasonably with the level of
the Beastlord after level 40.  This also puts them into line with the
last round of pet balancing, which did not improve beastlord pets at
the time.


** Horses **

- Locate corpse songs/spells should now work on horseback.
- Detect traps should also now work on horseback.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing manipulation of inventory items if a
character died with coins on the cursor.
- Invisibility on horseback should now make your horse invisible to
NPCs as it does the rider.
- Zoning with Levitate/Levitation and horse no longer causes the
levitation to fail.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the horse 'buff' to disappear when
zoning in some zones. 
- Player characters on horseback can now be hit by various missiles,
such as arrows, thrown weapons or the various bolt spells from PCs and
NPCs.
- Call of the Hero should no longer put people under the world when
the caster is on horseback.
- Dragging a corpse while on a horse will no longer cause the corpse
fall under the world.
- You can now right click on spells to arrange your spell book when on
a horse.


** Zone Specific **

- We believe that we fixed the major source of lockups caused for
players in certain zones such as the Great Divide and Shadowhaven.
- Hierophant Oxyn in East Cabilis will be showing up again.

** An Ancient Arises **

Deep within the recesses of a cave yet unknown to the world at large,
a dark, menacing figure parts with the slumber that has kept him
silent for ages. The eyes of a magnificently ominous beast pierce
through the darkness, his memories flowing freely once more. In the
depths of this beast's mind sparks the knowledge that his prophetic
savior has been released from the ancient magiks of time, let loose
upon an unsuspecting world where the kin shall once again reign
supreme.

"My master's shackles have been trounced, and so it is written that in
this world that has been so deftly overrun by pitiful mortals, he
shall bring power back to those of the scale." The deep rumbling voice
of the beast lingers throughout the cavernous hideaway, the barely
distinguishable figure of a mighty lizard moves through the stone and
dirt and dust as if to leave the gloomy surroundings and find his
place once again upon Norrath proper.

"For far too long have I been a prisoner to the overwhelming might
that kept me in a state of secluded sleep; for far too long have I
been victim to the ancestral elemental forces keeping my master at
bay. Now I awaken and bring life back to the disciples; now shall the
lifeblood of the Four once again spread the word of prophecy!" The
footsteps of this great beast are slow but sure, moving through the
depths of the gaping mountain retreat towards the surface. Along the
walls, pebbles and stones that have remained dormant for years crumble
and crack, falling to the ground as the immense beast walks past.

A maze of dead ends and broken paths twists and turns in the expanse
beyond the figure's resting place.  The skeletons of those who had
tried - and failed - to make their way to him in the years he spent in
forced slumber remain, tumbled landmarks of heroes long lost. Slowly
he moves, his reptilian eyes darting back and forth looking for any
meager meals that may still be available. As he proceeds, he steps
atop a mighty echelon, overlooking the bodies that could not defy the
magical properties of the cave; fools of mortal thought, incapable of
fathoming the power that lay beyond them. "Time has been good to you,
my faithful warren... let us both pray that I no longer need you. The
time for the revival is at hand."
