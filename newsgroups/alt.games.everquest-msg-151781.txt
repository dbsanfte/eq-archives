Whereas, the Netgear router is EQ friendly out of the box.  For those that
are worried about figuring out how to configure it, the Netgear is a better
solution.  The cost is basically identical.  The only things you need to
configure on the Netgear are the same as you will need to configure on any
router.  At least, that was my experience.
