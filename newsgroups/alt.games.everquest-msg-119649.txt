A good necro almost makes a cleric superfluous.  Once you get good at
fearkiting (using a darkness spell and fear) you can keep your group
members from getting hit at all.  The SK can also help with the fear
kiting, but his spells will not be as good as yours.

A chanter would be a good idea to help with crowd control on bad
pulls, but the 4 of you should do fine in most instances.  Eventually
you as a necro can actually do crowd control with the Screaming Terror
spell.  I like your no twinking, no PL approach.  Just work at your
own pace and have fun.
