Nonetheless, that is the legal reality, at least until demonstrated 
otherwise in an actual court.

If you spend 6 years building a sandcastle at a beach on my resort and 
one night some kids come in and wreck it, that's life. It doesn't matter 
that you paid $5 bucks a day to park in my lot, or $100 bucks a year for 
a pass to enter the resort... the sand isn't yours, and what you made 
from it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to me. And if one day its gone 
nobody owes you anything. If you wanted to make a sandcastle to own 
and/or sell, you probably shouldn't have done it on my beach.

The money you paid was entrance to the resort and access to the beach 
for your leisure (or access to the game). The time you spent there was 
your own leisure time, you only have yourself to blame if you thought it 
was an 'investment of labour for profit'. If that is what you wanted, 
you should have done things quite differently.
