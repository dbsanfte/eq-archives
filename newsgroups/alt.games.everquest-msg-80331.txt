Ok.. FYI...  its  not a bug its purposely done by VI as a incentive to
stop people from using the /quit command as a escape hatch to get out
of a bad situation gone worse. If they know they have a active
character still on server battling away with no direction.. and could
possibly die even quicker if they had stayed.. maybe they won't use
that. At the very least if you stay there.. you COULD pull some rabbit
out of your hat trick and manage to escape (in game) by the skin of
your teeth.

I remember the days when you use to be able log back in real quick and
sometimes still even be in the group you were in.
I really miss that.  /me cry

Here is a prime example of the /quit command gone wrong!!
I was trying to get my 19 Beastlord through Paladul caverns so I 
could get bound at Shadowhaven and go on to Nexus.
Well I died that first time.. way too many way fiends started taking a
bite out of my ass.  So I  thought I would get smart and use my 51
ranger to clear a path.. (hehe.. all this cause I couldn't get any
help from anyone in zone or guildmemebers at the time).
I would load ranger and clear a stretch then load BL and move up... 
Then load ranger and repeat process all over again.
Well this sequence worked great.. that is till I almost got to zone on
other side.  I didn't time it too good and a couple fiends spawned  on
me and then a couple more wandered in., I let them agro on warder and
I backed a ways off then used /quit command. I thougth I would be ok.
So I load ranger again, intending to clear out that area and Lo and
Behold, there I see my BL's corpse laying there!! CRAP!!!
