Ahh, this is a new one for me, hadn't heard this before. But it's puzzling.
How would the game generator know which kind of adventure this ad hoc group
had previously taken? Even tracking that information for the group leader
selecting it would impose some additional database overhead for every player
in the game. I bet this is one of those rumors that build up based on
someone's anecdotal observations that suggested a trend that's actually the
RNG at work. Or, maybe it really is part of the SOE policy. Where'd you hear
about this one?

/agree. When people ask what type of adventure to pick I tell them I have no
preference, go with whatever comes up. I do believe that Rescue are more of
a challenge because of the requirement of pulling what is sometimes a
temperamental little npc across the entire zone without getting him killed,
but that just makes the success all the more satisfying.

In my case it wasn't explicitly what got me back into EQ (that was more of a
departure from SWG than anything else). I just kind of poked my head back
inside EQ while looking for the next MMOG to occupy my time and I discovered
this LDoN thing. Wow, am I glad I did...
