It is apparantly possible, though, to do something with outside the game 
tools, for example a programmable joystick, which might be set to use 
your hotkey number for its autofire button.

I haven't actually tried this, don't know anything about the ins and 
outs of it, but apparantly rangers use such a tool to allow them to fire 
arrows which would otherwise require clicking every half second for a 
half hour straight in some cases.

Bards can just set one song on and leave it run overnight in a zone like 
POK where there's no danger at all; you'll come back to find that 
instrument capped for your level.

Melee characters can apparantly find someone with the Pet Hold AA and 
duel them, leaving themselves beating on an opponent that never hits 
back overnight, and return in the morning to find that weapon skill 
capped... but like casters, they can't cap out their other skills like 
kick, dodge, parry, block, defense, throwing, archery, etc. in an 
automated way without recourse to some outside the game tool.
