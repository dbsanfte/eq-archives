Ask any old Morell-Thule (now E-Marr) player abour Sunmoon.  The guy
regularly 12-boxed.  I don't know if he ever tried to play more than
just 6 at a time but he often had 2 groups logged in.  He had his own
guild: Evil Raiders.  (E-Bay Raiders).  People often speculated about
what their guild chat must be like =)

Sunmoon spent a lot of time farming in BoT before he got in real
trouble.  People complained about his incessant training and ganking
for well over a year.  He finally quit when a few of his toons were
banned.  the guy was a real piece of work.  He once screwed up a ring
war by killing all the Dwarves apparently just out of spite.

I could go on and on about what a punk this guy was.
