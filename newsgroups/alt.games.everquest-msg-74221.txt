Well there's a quest to register yourself as a trader in Shadowhaven,starts
with a guy in the warrior hall in Shadowhaven.I imagine you'll have to do
this quest before you can become a NPC trader.Once Verant sorts out the bugs
& exploits in the Bazaar hopefully they'll implement this
feature,speculation is that you stand under the canopies in the bazaar,set
up your prices and go to bed or work,then come back and count your
cash.Luckily the Bazaar is a safezone from PKers so those of us who play on
PvP servers won't get killed & looted with several thousand plat on us.
