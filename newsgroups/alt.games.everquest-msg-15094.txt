I must protest!  Those limericks have nothing to do with EQ!

And now you must pay the penalty.  Your punisment: Gnomish Poetry. by Farghen.


Kedge Keep:
Concentration was lacking for sure
When disaster in Kedge Keep occured
Ambushed and waylaid
By a bare-chested mermaid
And I couldn't cast mammary blur
        -Farghen


Halas:
Halas is a town most gnomes love
As well as the citizens thereof
For the lasses all flirt
As I walk 'neath their skirts
And proclaim, "Heavens Above!"
        -Farghen




If it happens again, I'll be back!
