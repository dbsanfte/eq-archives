>1. What does AC stand for?

Armour class. The higher it is, the better.

>2. Is it possible to get a list of my group factions?

Unfortunately no. All you can do is /consider the different NPCs/monsters 
you see in the world. You can't even tell who belongs to which faction 
until you already have damaged your relations with them.

>3. How do I check my weapon stats?

Click and hold the right mouse button on the weapon icon in your inventory, 
the same way as when checking the stats of any other object.
