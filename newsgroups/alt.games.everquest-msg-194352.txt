I've been using groups.google.com as my primary "newsreader" until 
recently.   It's great for using when at work.  However, when contrasting 
with a real newsreader, I notice that bizbee's posts don't make it onto 
google.  The only time I ever saw those posts are when someone replied.

Bizbee - what exactly are you doing that prevents your posts from appearing 
on google?
