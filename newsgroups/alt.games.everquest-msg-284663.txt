I meant to reply to this when I first saw it, this is exactly what I was
talking about when I said "in an AOE group".  The PB AOE spells are 
given to several classes, and are pretty much useless for anything but 
this tactic; combining PB AOE damage with PB AOE stuns to kill dozens of 
mobs at a time while preventing them from killing you.

Its possible to run a group like this with  no healer at all, after all 
in theory the mobs are stun locked and don't get to deal any damage... 
but resists tend to make exceptions to that theory, and a healer 
increases the odds of success.  Any healer could do that job though, its 
not a CHeal critical mission; clerics get faster bigger heals and nice 
group heals, so they have the advantage to some extent...

But the principle reason you'd want to include a cleric instead of some 
other class is another popular function of the cleric that people are 
overlooking in the "nothing but heals" theory.  Clerics have the best 
Rez.   While they are present as healers to back up the total stun lock 
being laid down by the enchanters, they can't do anything if the 
enchanters get stunned themselves and stop laying down the lock.  30 or 
40 (actually the most mobs I ever killed in a group like this was 70) 
mobs out from under stun lock are a fast wipe for the party, and  anice 
96% rez really helps make up for that.  When you're getting exp for 
killing 40 mobs at a time, and occaisionally losing 4% of what you 
normally would for a death, you just shrug off the deaths and get back 
to work.
