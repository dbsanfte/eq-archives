Well it may have been a nerf if you were one of the folks sitting down 
midcast, but for the rest of us it was a boon.  Ducking used to cause 
your spell to not complete,  but the entire cast time was still run 
through and the spell cancelled if you were ducking at the end.  With 
the change you get an immediate interupt which is much more useful as 
far as I am concerned.  The ability to duck out of a CH and immediately 
start healing the enchanter is worth a lot more to me than a chance to 
sit down midcast.
