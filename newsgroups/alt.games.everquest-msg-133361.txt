no you don't

if you're creating it, just create some names . .. the truth is that most
qeynos npcs are not popular anyway, so you won't get a lot of "Hey, the
lowbie standing at the sewers by the INT caster's guild is named 'luton,'
not 'eric' !" (or whatever)

but why copy the map anyway? qeynos is nothing special

really, you trying to make more work for yourself?
