Relative closeness depends on how you're viewing the classes.  With
few exceptions, Paladin spells are drawn from the cleric list.  Also,
Paladins and Clerics come from the same organizations and their NPC
guildleaders often share the same buildings, or even rooms within
the buildings, so RP-wise Paladin and Cleric are about as close as
two classes can get.  Not to mention that the Clerics share several
lines of spells, including the class-defining "rez" spell line, with
Paladins alone and not with the other priest classes.

Still, I have to agree with the poster who said that the correct fix
is to remove CHeal, not spread it around.
