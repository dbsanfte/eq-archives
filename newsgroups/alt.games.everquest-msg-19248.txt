Although you -could- do this, and probably should
for training purposes, when you actually -need- bash
you want to have it manually controlled.  Wait
for that nasty caster to start a spell and -then- bash
him one good.  I did the same basic thing with
Stun for many levels, although when I finally got
my third stun I eschewed that in favor of the
chain stun hotkey which drops whichever the
cheapest stun I have available on the target so that
he is -constantly- stunned.  There are just certain
mobs that can never ever be allowed to cast anything,
and I'm sorry if you die but I have no time to cast
anything but this stun until that thing is dead.
