I have come across an odd problem here.  First off, I have a lvl 30
human necro that follows Innoruk.  I decided to go wandering as I have
done alot lately and I come across a map of SB mountains that I printed
out a while back.  So, off I go.  I get to Erudin and they are all
dubious and noone wants to sell.  No big deal, Paineel is the evil city,
right?  Walk in and the little green guards are scowling.  No big deal
since Warrens is right there and they have plenty of fodder for me to
take out to get the faction up.  Here is my problem.  After 2 days and
just short of 600 kobolds, I am still scowling in Paineel.  What's the
deal with these guys?  Is it a race or God problem that they will never
like me?  I am up to amiable in Erudin even though they still don't like
me for being a necro and won't sell or buy.  I am going to go nuts if I
have to keep going to Qeynos to unload all that copper I get off the
kobolds(cleared the whole level including the named ones and not a
single plat).  So for now I have resigned to making my pet rich off the
coppers and moving myself out to SB where I get the occasional exp off
the camps out there.  Any ideas here or previous experiences with this
race/god combo would be greatly appreciated.
