When your sites popularity requires you to pay for multiple T1's
you have to make some serious choices. Since we are all immune
to banners and pop-ups .( I can close most with the mouse before
they load) It's going to be pay to play for the good content they
just have to find a price the market will bear. If they could get
a package together that had a network of good sites for one yearly
fee I'd pay but the nickel and dime stuff will fail IMO.
