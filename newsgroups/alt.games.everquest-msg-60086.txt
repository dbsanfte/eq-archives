Not really sure of which animal types (if any even, my highest is 42,
and my druid is only 32) are of sufficient level, but I would think fear
kiting animals would be a better bet for you, dot's do full damage when
the mob is running away, plus you as a ranger can be dishing out the
full amount of damage that you can pounding on the critters back.
