This is possible, but it wasn't so around a year ago.  I had friends that
would group with me, but high raid groupings would advertise for clerics,
fighters, and enchanters.  Somtimes they would allow along a shaman or two,
maybe a ranger or other fighter hybrid, but Druids were conspicuously NOT
invited.

I've been gone for about six months, maybe this has changed.  If so, I'm
surprised.

Still, this isn't the point.  The point is the making a major part of my
class's utility superfulous without offerring anything in its place.

And you know, I found it a pain as well...  Still, I'd rather be useful and
inconvenienced, than useless.  <shrug>  I like helping out my friends.  I'm
GLAD they don't have to wait for me to get to them now, but I STILL want to
be useful.  I'm not saying I'm useless, I can still help, but I'm a lot LESS
useful, and I resent that they automated of of my major contributions into
obsolescence, and gave me nothing to take its place.

That's what I heard, but only a vague "maybe" not a firm promise.  If that
was supposed to be a firm promise, they're running out of time.

It's been done to us before.  It's STILL being done to us.  Every try to get
"Improved Superior Camoflage"?

> > and won't even do what the old disabled spell could do.
> Nor should it.

Why not?  It's not a sure kill, nor is it a major game balance killer.  It
had restrictions, it could only be used outdoors, some mobs were immune, it
had a VERY short casting range, so anything with a wide aggro radius would
come after you LONG before you got close enough to cast on it.

It WAS a nice spell though, and about the only one we had that was actually
STRONGER than everyone elses.  Even our transport spells were more
cumbersome than the other class that had them, and we were supposed to be
THE travelling class.  Still, that ONE spell was stronger than lull, even
with it's restrictions it was nice.

The fact is that there was NOTHING wrong with that spell, it just got in the
way of some of the things they wanted to do in the new POP expansion.  In
other words, it became INCONVENIENT to them for us to have it, so WHAP.  Say
goodbye to one of the few nice things our class has had for four years.  VI
didnt' want to bother dealling with it, so it's gone.

> Funny, I've never seen this happen to a Druid.  Ever.

I have.  Still, I'm only 44th level, and haven't done any planes stuff.  In
addition, when I saw it happen a lot was around a year ago, things may have
changed.

Even if we retain some utility though, it doesn't reduce my main complaint.

Now this is insulting.

Actually, I'm inexperienced at grouping, but have been told I can handle
myself.  I've learned some of the main pitfalls, which spells agro, when to
burn, etc.  I still have a lot to learn before I'll feel free to go on a
plane raid, but I'll get there.

The accusation however is downright nasty.  What the hell did I do to you to
cause THIS?

Are you just in a bad mood today?  If so, go take it out on your boss, not
me...

Just don't beat the dog, he doesnt' deserve it.
