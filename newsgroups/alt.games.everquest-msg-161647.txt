Here's the LoV system as I understand it:

Points are awarded for any "raid" with 18 or more people.  Targets taking
less than this are pointless and loot division handled however you like.

For normal raids, a point per hour of raid.

For quick but important targets; FFA dragons etc, minimum of three points.
(we had a LOT of people skipping this sort of raid, because it was only a
point and  the target didnt' drop anything they could use)

No set values at all, all items up for bid.

You may only bid for an item if you are on the raid where it drops.  You
may only bid on items you can and will use.  Alts may only bid up to half
their main's point total, and only if the alt is present.

Items which recieve no bid, but which are MQable or not No Drop are taken
for the guild vault.  No Drop items which are not for MQ are opened to a
random roll if there's anyone at all that will take them for free.

Periodically, items from the guild vault are offered to public guild wide
bidding, and if noone wants them, guild mules attempt to sell or trade them
for plat, peridot, or other basic commodities the guild goes thru
regularly.

I'm not saying I'm a big fan of this system, just describing it.
