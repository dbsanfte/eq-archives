You are really stretching, aren't you? Give it up, eh?

*eyeroll* C'mon, you'd be right on the bandwagon of parrots screeching
at me to "CITE! CITE!" if I made such a ludicrous claim. You wouldn't
accept me telling you to "do the research yourself". Cite or shut the
fuck up.

Both are examples of bugs that wreaked havoc, causing problems to
LARGE amounts of players until they were fixed. The spreading of the
word made them more widely used, and crashing zones was bad for
everyone else in the zone. Neither are even vaguely relevant to some
workaround for imaginary tool SOE uses to shut down EQ on Bazaar
traders.

Cite, jackass, or shut the fuck up.
