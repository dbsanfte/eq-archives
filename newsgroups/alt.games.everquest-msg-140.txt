I wasn't too excited about 3 and 4, but I really like 1 and 2!

I happen to know a guy on my server who does really bad things. Way
back on his first account (before he was banned), he did things like:
He knew a guy had full inventory, and said "Oh, I'd really like to
take a look at your midnite mallet. Would you put it in trade, so I
can look? " And then end the trade, watching the item fall to the
ground, pick it up quickly and run away. Pretty crappy...Well, I
haven't heard from the guy in ages, and recently I heard a zone
shout...Everyone, watch out for Mizfit, he stole my stuff!!! For some
reason, I had a feeling it was the old Jorf I knew. So I asked. He
admitted they deleted his account, so he started a new one.

Why do I say this? Well, I think it might bring some relief to the
many irritated players who get screwed over. You'd have to do it in a
way that there wasn't really any monetary / EXP gain or loss, more of
an event, like once a month you go to Freeport area and watch the
hangings. If the 'to be hung' player wants to be online, he is forced
into the hanging, is not allowed to hunt. If he doesn't want to come
online, they make a replica of him, so that all he's transgressed can
watch him die.

Then, for a week or so, whenever he comes online, his character is
surrounded by a piss yellow aura, so everyone who sees him knows he
was hung for being a jerk. No REAL exp loss, but a near-harmless way
to encourage people not to piss others off.

Also, there could be a limit to submitting someone for bounty. They
would have to either be within grouping level range, or maybe they
would limit how many from the same guild reports the guy. But if
enough people complain, they stage a hanging.
