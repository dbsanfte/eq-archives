hehe, try doing that with a mob breathing down your neck Actually, what I
find annoying is getting half way thru a long message, getting smacked by a
mob and then wondering whether I should send the unintelligible message,
backspace and die or complete it and die. However, now you will tell me that
there is a quick way to negate a message in progress, "Escape" perhaps,
didn't think of that. No I don't think it will, it will probably untarget
the mob that just smacked you. Oh well, I am sure someone knows.
