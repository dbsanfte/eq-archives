Well I finally got a leather BP from kael just last night... I've solo'd,
duo'd, and raided in arena/bank/tormax ramp soo much, it's just always
evaded me.

When kael armour was important to the guild, leather BP's (and HoT) were
druid only items.. not a major issue really (I've had an ancient wyvern hide
bp since about the start of the year).. but now I have the same heal option.

Was an interesting kael group..  we started with just 1 group clearing
Tormax ramp (tormy was up), the third mob dropped the tunic!

Then some monk in a bank group came bitching how bank was HER camp (which is
cool.. we were doing tormy ramp)  I hadn't even pulled a single bank mob so
wasn't really in the mood for it.. she threatened to train us, i laughed :)

I killed Captain Bvellos with a rogue at the zone line (her groups train
incidently) so now the shaman/cleric were there (me and the rogues bots)
there wasn't really much harm she could cause with her pesky bank mobs

Just took 2 groups and 1 puller (was a pain in the ass singling every single
mob though) and we cleared the whole room except wingmen/tormy.   hit 25
people, got the wingmen and killed Tormy in one of our best/easiest kills
(with like half the people and lag on a normal raid)

Can you even remember when you last 10k'd?  In my entire EQ life as a monk I
10k'd in Velks once (bug im sure, because ive done it time and time again
without problem), and once in WW when I was too busy watching the loc, and
ran straight over the edge of the ToV canyon.

I've seen rolan and (whats the WW flux dragon) agro and toss everybody in
the air, its funny as hell watching every "fatty" char take an instant 10k
fall.  I still take 1.2k+ on those fluxes/falls

I heard return kick is broken, double riposte looks like minimal damage
increase, and only when im tanking..  I guess knockback will be my next
skill (tho it seems such a waste of 5 aa levels for something I could get in
a weapon from a western wastes easy mob)

Its more expensive than critical mend (initially anyway)

Is talk of AA skills in PoP just a baseless rumour?  I would hate to spend
levels on junky aa skills if were going to get some new ones which will be
worthwhile
