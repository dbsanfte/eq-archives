That depends...  On who you'll be selling to... If you just sell to vendors,
nope... You'll wind up losing money, or not making very much money...  But,
you could stand to make a lot of money on certain items by selling to
players....  For example:

Take a Backpack Pattern (about one plat), one HQ Bear Pelt (usually sells
for 30 plat or loot for free off bears), and I believe one silk cord (made
from spiderling silks)...  You can make a backpack that has 10% weight
reduction, and /auction for 100 plat.
