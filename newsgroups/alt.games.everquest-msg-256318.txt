    I understand where you are coming from, Jennaii.  I was burning out on
EQ when I started my epic, though I didn't see that at the time.  It was a
bad move for me.  I spent 22 hours over the course of a weekend getting the
ring from SolA.  I spent the whole time thinking "Wonder why the devs think
that forcing me to be bored out of my skull this long, to in effect being
punished for trying to get an item that is considered to be mandatory at
higher levels, is in any way fun?"  Gave me alot of time to think.  I am
paying to play a game to have fun.  I am being in effect pressured to get
this item, and I am being forced to spend a massive amount of downtime to
do it.

    I don't know that if I hadn't started my epic I would still be playing,
but it sure didn't help any.
