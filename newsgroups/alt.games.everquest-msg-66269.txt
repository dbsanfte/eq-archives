Teeth?

What, are you biting things to death?


I haven't seen teeth, but I have noticed that for some reason my
attacks all appear to be using my secondary slot rather than my
primary. I keep seeing the doll that is my Paw of Opolla flash past
rather than my club.

Course, being a druid I could be flailing about with damn near
anything, and it wouldn't matter - I'd miss every time regardless.
