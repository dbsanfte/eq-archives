I agree with that.

Ugh, I hate that look.

I don't look at fantasy art, except if MTG cards count.  (I played
for a brief while until I realized what a money sink it was.)

Perhaps I'm too old to care how the models are designed exactly.
I don't particularly like or dislike them.  I don't think it's
possible to get a good honest opinion on them from a public
newsgroup, because I think the men that enjoy them won't be willing
to admit it, afraid that it'll seem immature or wrong.

On a related note, I've started a new character, a female this
time.  You know, it's amazing how much more attention and stuff
you get, without even trying, by playing a female.
