Hmmm...this is one of those things where context is everything.  E.g.,
if we are talking about where to target a nuke to take out an EQ
server, or whether some natural disaster will take down all of EQ, or
where to buy plane tickets to if you want to spend your vacation on a
pilgrimage to the EQ servers, then they are in one location.

On the other hand, if you are talking about network connectivity
issues, they are in two locations that are near each other.
