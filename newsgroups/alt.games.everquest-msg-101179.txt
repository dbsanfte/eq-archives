You got lucky then: I've since spoken to a GM about my petition.

He has confirmed that the quest appears broken.  At the current time,
the list the NPC asks for is _not_ what he accepts.

Namely, the Cloud Jewel simply isn't the right item.  Unfortunately,
the GM would not tell me what the correct item is, because that would
be unfair to other wizards.  :-(

I got the submitted items reimbursed, and was told to await a fix in a
patch.  Bah.

Tris.

ps.  This was on Torvonillous.

pps.  Three cheers for Chrol, the server GM there - Friendly, patient,
      readily admitted his minor mistake (he thought I had handed in
the
      wrong items, until I pointed out the NPC's dialogue), and got
everything
      sorted.
