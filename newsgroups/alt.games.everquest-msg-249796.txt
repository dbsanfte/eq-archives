Presumably not, if he posed a risk to the other prisoners he would be 
isolated from them.

You could argue that its perhaps against the small but non-trivial event 
he might escape, but you'd be wrong. :)

State executions are justified not as 'self defence' but as a nod to 
some demand for the maximum 'punishment' for truly evil behaviour. 
Prison after all is (in theory) 1 part protection of the public, 1 part 
rehabilitation, and 1 part punishment. The public wants their criminals 
'Punished'. (This unfortunately is at odds with their desire to have 
criminals Rehabiliated, which causes the unpopular perception of 
prisons-as-resorts with libraries computers and classes.

I suppose you could argue there is a nod to efficiency as well, because, 
(again in theory) it should be cheaper to execute a man than incarcerate 
him for life without parole. But currently, at least, that is not a 
consideration when handing out the death sentence.
