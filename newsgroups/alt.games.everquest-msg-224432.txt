Dang - I think I will give up trying to write posts in the morning. I just
tried to read what I wrote this morning and the terrible grammer and
derailed train of thought was a headache to follow. Maybe I need intravenous
coffee to get the old noggin working a bit better ... or maybe it is less
coffee would do the trick...
