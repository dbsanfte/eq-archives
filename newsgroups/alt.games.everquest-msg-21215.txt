Okay, after WAY too much EQ time I was able to get to 46 in time for the
Hate raid my guild is hosting tonight. I'm taking a half day off from work
to get at least halfway into 46 before the raid starts. Yeah, 47 would be
better, but 45 was dreadful, and it took much longer than I expected to get
through.

Any tips for newbie planar people? I know I need to follow directions, and
try not to get killed too often, but other than that I have no idea. This is
a big raid (7 or 8 groups) and apparently they are even going to try for
Innoruuk if it doesn't get too late. Luckily my guild leader has done many
Hate raids, and I know it will be well run and organized.

BTW, being in the right guild makes SO much difference in EQ. I was in a
mediocre guild before - nice group of people for the most part, but little
leadership, and too much infighting. I left them in May, and joined my
current guild just about 1 month ago. What an amazing difference!  Most of
the people in guild are 50+ so it's been a big motivation for me to level
(whereas before I didn't see the point). They are also VERY nice and
helpful - I've gotten some nice gear, lots of encouragement and last night I
even got my Sebilis key! Woot!  (yeah, I'm really too low, but they are
planning a guild "raid" and wanted as many people to come as possible)

Anyhow, any "Hate for Dummies" tips out there? :-)
