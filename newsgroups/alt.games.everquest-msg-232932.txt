The lights are dead on both ends.

Cheers. Did all of the above previous to posting. The lights are down, 
but I still tried pinging the PC from the Mac (and from the router's own 
Ping interface). Not a sausage.

The network card is not onboard, but PCI, and as far as Windows can 
diagnose, there's nothing wrong with it. :-/ I will replace it if it 
comes to that, but I'd like to exhaust my options first.
