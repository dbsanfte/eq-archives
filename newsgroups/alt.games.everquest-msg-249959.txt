Well.. while your kudos is certainly interesting.. I really don't set
out to take the opposite opinion on everything. I really would like to
see Gaming Accounts through your local bank and the ability to use
those to buy in-game items. Is it unpopular.. sure, but i really do
believe in it and having had previous knowledge in both hardware and
software.. i know its not only doable, but will be done eventually.

And its not anything that hasn't allready been put forth in science
fiction. From identi-cards in Babylon 5 to ... whatever.
