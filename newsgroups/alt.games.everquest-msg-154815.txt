Hehe, couldnt agree more Bergh. Manaburn nice as a tool for some fast 
dmg (we used 1 MB in Faydedar once around 10 sec before fight would have 
been wiped, and won), and think this way of fixing is are the best. 
Manaburn still work in the same way, a wizard so a FAST amouth of dmg to 
end critical fights, and all my guilds wizards are still saving up for it.

As i see it, the ONLY things you cant do with the new manaburn are MB 
teams (Bards had a HARD time on epics on Veeshan because of FoHs 
manaburn team killed Gore all the time, SUCK to get 20+ people ready for 
dragon slaying, and have a 5 person group port in and MB her while youre 
buffing), and use the mod rod trick to get a nice MB dmg boost at start 
of fights, which is VERY unbalancing, and in my opinion damaging for the 
game, since enought MB wizards would just have forced VI to give mobs 
even more HP, and make the mobs unkillable for guilds without 10 MB wizards.
