When I upgraded from 128 to 160 with Kunark it made a hell of a difference.
When I upgraded from 160 to 256 I noticed NO difference.

If all you do on your PC is play EQ and some piddly other stuff I'd
definitely recommend upgrading to 256.  If you're already there, take your
girlfriend out to a cheap restaurant instead (faction work is always
important :) ).
