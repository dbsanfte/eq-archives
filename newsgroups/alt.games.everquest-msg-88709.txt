There was a nice post on here the other day about corpse decay/res times and
the new timer added with the last patch.  There seems to be a few glitches
or something strange going on.  Has anyone else seen this?  My sons 4th
level Necro was killed under the Qeynos docks (Friday afternoon).   I met
him with my rogue character to see if I could help him and dragged the body
onto the dock.   I checked the timer and it gave me the strange message that
the corpse had 1193046 hours  33 min 24 sec.  After reading the post I
thought this meant that the time had run out, but that there was some weird
glitch that left it available for a while longer.  He hurried up and made
his way on the boat to Qeynos and was able to loot his body with 7min to
spare on the min portion of the timer.  The hour portion never changed.  He
got everything but his book and the body was left on the dock.  Today I came
back to Qeynos from  Erud and there was his body still on the dock.  But the
really strange thing is that when I checked the timer it has the same amount
of time left on it that it did when he looted it.
