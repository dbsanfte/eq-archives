Have a 54 Barbie War as mule in bazaar, wont make that mistake again
if im going to put up with size problems I want no stuns or regen too.
RP and Zek matters aside of course.

Was considering more the 50-60 game than higher. Really can be a
completely different game. Yes the no stun thing can be huge as can
the size and xp penalty (which doesn't figure for AAs). Will never
forget first time I tried getting an Ogre to UD in velks, man what
royal pain. Still think humans are the best all around but that's what
they were ment to be. 

60-65 don't think there's enough difference to really matter.

The main thing is not class or race its always the player and with
melees the players equipment. Good Luck
