I believe that you take the highest level person in the group and multiply 
his level by 2/3.  That will give you the lowest level of someone who can 
group with them and get full experience.  There are other people here who 
know the answer to this, so, hope I'm wrong because someone will refute it 
ASAP!

Re: Rezzes.  Go to the eq.castersrealm.com site.  Click on SPELL LISTS on 
the left, choose Cleric.  Look at their spells and the descriptions.  When 
you find one that says something about rezzing, click on it and read about 
it.  I don't know level they start to get this, but I would start about 
level 34 in your search.  Look for Revive, I think.
