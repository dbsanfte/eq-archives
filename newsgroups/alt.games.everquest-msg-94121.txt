Big question for me was...WILL they let you move off the Legends server to
ANY other server or simply back to your old one?  They didn't seem all that
clear in what I was reading.

Since I'm already on a good server and I'm NOT worried about a stranger or
two showing up on my server who is dodging their rep, I don't really care
all that much, I'm just mildly curious.
