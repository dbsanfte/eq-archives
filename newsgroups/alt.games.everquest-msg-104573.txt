    For KEI, yeah. Afterlife rolls on other stuff too, though. Depends if
folks are close enough in points.

    You're a good person, though. Even though we screen folks, we still get
the odd lootwhore. One just left us after screaming in an e-mail about how
he wasn't "appreciated" enough. Guess we didn't increase his E-Bay value by
enough dollars per week.

    It's an exceptional item - there aren't many earrings out there. Our
tanks have mostly that one off Yelinak, and it doesn't hold a candle to
this. Other earrings I've seen them wear are the Fingerbone Hoop, blue
diamond, Electrum Black Sapphire - this thing blows them away.

    Remember, we all have maxed WIS/INT. That is the LAST stat I want to see
on a piece of gear. I want HPs, resists, MANA, and some AC just in case.
Most of our casters have black sapphire earrings - this is a big step up. On
my cleric this would be 10 MANA 65 HPs 5 PR/DR and 6 AGI (dwarf cleric, 70
base ouch) in improvements over what I have on now. And yes, I'm a HP
junkie - the more I have the more I can Mod Rod and not get frenzy aggro.
I'm almost to the magic (for me) 4 K with raid buffs mark, and I won't be
happy until I cross it.

    I was happy to see our warrior get it. On him, it's a 130 HP earring
that also has ten points of resists. We're just getting to the point where
all our regular fatty warriors are over 7 K hps in full raid buffs, and it's
getting a lot easier to keep them alive. Our last parse on the AoW showed
that we could go 4 seconds between CHeals and the main tank wouldn't die -
that makes it very easy to construct a robust CH chain.
