Ranger epics are incredible for how easy they are to get - Swiftwind
especially is the best offhand in the game for us pretty much. Its
parsing out as equal to or better than things like the tolans longsword
from Vulak and the Acrylia broadsword... the +30 ATK on it is just
insane.

Earthcaller, well thats a slog to get, and you will surpass eventually
in terms of damage/delay, but its *always* useful to have a 50hp
high resists 50% slow 500pt DoT proccing sword for soloing, etc.
