This is usenet, I don't need permission to dis systems I don't like.

Heck, I live in the USA, where we seem to have forgotten one of the founding
father's mottoes;

"This is Liberty Hall, you can spit on the floor and call the cat a bastard".

That said, I'm not suggesting its the wrong way to do things, just that it seems
to send a certain message to people who only average around 50% attendance, which
is "you aint gettin paid".  To my way of thinking, thats the message they want to
send.  If the OP expects his attendence to come back up over 60% average then its
really no big deal and not a problem if thats fine with him.

I've been in guilds with features I didn't like, in some cases I was in the guild
despite the system because of friendships or other features, and was willing to
take the bad with the good, in other cases, I joined the guild when it had one set
of rules and later they changed to a new system I liked less.  One rule may well
not be enough to make someone leave a guild they like otherwise, and it can still
be a rule they don't like.

Back to the parallel with the USA; I may think that some US laws are a bad idea, I
may think that some things that are legal shouldn't be, I might despise the
current administration, but all in all I love the country too much to leave it;
like Ivory Soap,  99.94% pure... even if sometimes Canada does look like a mighty
good alternative (cough*patriot act*cough)
