I don't have that lance to compair so they maybe the same graphic, but
I doubt I can get the heavy velium lance fer 75 pp like I did this one
:) I was commenting on this item because of the price mostly. It's
like the pendy arm in a way. I always get confused when it comes to
the damage reductions on these recommended level items. I mean, the
wiz int and other stats I understand but the damage never seems to be
nerfed like it says. Like if the new value for your level is 32 delay
2-3 damage you still hit fer 21 at level 4? how is that right? It
seems to me you should hit for no more then 4-6 or something. Anyways,
that's my 2 cp :)
