	Well, I don't exactly agree with that.  Sure, you can power through
the first 60 levels in 2 weeks now.  Good thing, too, because there's no
way you could do it the "right" way.  There simply aren't enough new 
players or even old players starting new characters.  And you can buy stuff
that wouldn't be obtainable to a top raiding guild a few years ago.  

	But the new expansions haven't been "dumbed".  Even with super
gear and all the new spells you have to know what you're doing to, say,
kite treants in hills of shade.  And not because they have 10 million HP
or summon every 2 seconds either.  They're actually tricky casters.

	Same thing pulling skeletons in Loping or splitting the robots
in the forts...  I've had more fun with the Faydwer expansion than I've
had in a long time.

	Maybe it's different if you group 1/2 :-)
