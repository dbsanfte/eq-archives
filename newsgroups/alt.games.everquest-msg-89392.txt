Perhaps before you quit somehow this character stayed logged in and got into
a bind/death cycle all the way down to 22.
That or your brother/sister/uncle/dog has been playing on your account while
you were away and is hopeless at the game.
Maybe you got hacked. It tells me at the login screen how many failed
attempts have been made to access my account when I successfully log in. I'm
not sure if this is something that exists on your older version or if its
just put in with the patch. Thinking that the message goes when you
successfully log in so its actually a useless feature if you are actually
hacked.

Basically there's nothing you can do but collect clues as to how it
happened, see if you have all your equipment etc.

Have fun gaining those levels again.
