Hello again.
    I had posted a request for advice on equipment upgrades about 4 days
ago. Either I didn't even get a nibble, or my NGP just didn't pick up;
anyways, thought I'd try once more, but broaden the topic a bit.
What do people look for in secondary equipment?  Something that you would
put on for an effect while worn, or to cast something then replace with your
regular equipment?  As a warrior I'm AC-focused, but I'll slap on a Frost
Giant beard for a STR buff then put back my Grotesque Alloy mask.  I usually
wear the FBSS, even though I've got two other belts that provide 10 AC.  Is
it wise for a warrior to give up 10 AC (plus stats) to hit faster?
I'm still very unfamiliar with equipment available from Luclin. So unless
something better presents itself I plan on trying KC for its Cobalt Armor
drops and Jade Mace, until I can join a raid to either the plains or Kael.
Here's my current stuff.  Any advice is appreciated.

Velium Shield, Sentry maul
Ranged Weapon: 1-cam recurve bow , or Runed Bone Fork
