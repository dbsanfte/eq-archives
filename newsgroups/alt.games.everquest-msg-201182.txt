Actually the "stamina gear is the hardest to find" is an out of date
notion.  It used to be the case, but when Velious was released stamina
became far more common on newly implemented items.  In fact, I'm given
the impression that SOE has been overcompensating for stamina's rarity
in the early days.

My cleric, who I have never gone out of my way to get stamina items
for, has 132 stamina from my items.  That's far more than any stat
other than wisdom, which was the one stat I had been looking for, and
it's almost as much as the amount of wisdom items I have.

This has been the case with most of my characters.  My cleric is just
the one I found the most staggering.

It's just not hard to come by these days.

This isn't to suggest that you shouldn't put points into it with your
rogue at creation, because as you go up in levels, stamina is probably
the stat that means the most to any melee.  I just don't think it's
really any harder to raise than strength, dexterity or agility.
