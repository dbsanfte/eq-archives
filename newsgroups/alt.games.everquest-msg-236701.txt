Its almost as common a spell as complete heal, at high-end raids nowadays.
As others have said, it covers for lag, damage spikes, fuckups and just
about anything else (and with unfailing divinity, it can be relied on)

For group usage and small stuff it isnt terribly useful (for most)... but
GoD trials and DI go hand in hand.. so if you plan on working up through the
trials, its pretty much a [required] spell.
