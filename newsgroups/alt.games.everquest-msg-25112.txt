Sad? Nah.
I have a leather set, a velious leather set with sleeves, a black set.
I wear gnomeskin boots permanently and can't decide whether I want to
save up for gold (GE) or dark brown (Coldain skin) boots. I have a
runed mithril bracer, but wear my chipped bone bracer visibly since it
gives a nicer long sleeved glove effect with my gnome skin gloves. One
of the reasons I am not currently desperate to get an ES bracer is
that the sleeves would jar badly with my regular leather tunic look;
if I were wealthy I'd be much more likely to buy elven chainmail
instead. My shadow knight is twinked with Ry'gorr primarily because I
think she looks better in that than in plate, especially the leggings
and helm (That skull is sooo tacky)

Oh, and reeed set sounds a bit wrong :)
