All the softskins are KOS to the guards.  Just cammo yourself and get close
enough to summon your corpse.  Move away from the buildings dragging the
corpse the entire time (that won't drop the cammo).

To raise faction requires killing (literally) thousands of Sarnaks and
Goblins.  The faction you want to raise is the Legion of Cabilis faction.
The ones you lowered when you killed the Sarnak, you were KOS to anyway.
