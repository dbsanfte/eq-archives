Low end items (you mentioned bone chips) have gone way up.

I used to sell a stack of leather padding in EC for 100pp.  I thought
that was pretty good.  Now, an individual leather pad goes for 20p.
(i.e., the stack goes for 400pp).

Some equipment has gone down in price because availablity has
increased but also because as the expansions have come in, other
cheaper, easier-to-get alternate equipment has become available.
