Hmmm, I would say the first few levels are about learning
basic game mechanics that are universal to all classes.  Just
not enough differentiation early.  Heck, mages aren't even a
pet class 'til level 4.

Personally, if I start a new character on a server where I
already have a presence, I make those early levels
as easy as possible.
