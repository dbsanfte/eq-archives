Interesting, so did mine. It happened to me after last Tuesday's
patch. I figured "what the heck" and resubscribed - I'm not too
bothered about paying twice for a couple of months but I'll be
checking my credit card statement pretty throroughly when it arrives.

My characters were all still there by the way with all their stuff -
well the stuff that wasn't buried in a wall waiting for a GM to get it
out that is.
