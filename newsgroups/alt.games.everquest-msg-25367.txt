    As LoS has shown, you can never have too many feesh. ;-)

    I hear that line a LOT from top guilds. "We don't want to be mere Zergs,
we want to know our stuff!" But I have yet to see a Zerg guild that has a
lot of success. I imagine Zerg guilds can't be terribly successful because
they can't equip people properly with so many members - I've heard a lot of
stories about loot squabbles in huge guilds. I also imagine top guilds want
to discourage anyone who could even theoretically compete with them for top
encounters, even though Zergs don't scale up against mobs with AoE damage
output.
