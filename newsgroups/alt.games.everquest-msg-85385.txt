Yup, especially for mages, especially now - Chain research is a MAJOR
pita - and you can buy the 39 and 44 pets now in Katta Castellum.  Given
how short a period you need the 49 pets (except for fire*) you don't need
research skill for that one.  I have a couple of high level mage friends
who will do the combine when I get the components.



* You only need your 49 fire if you're part of a guild that needs to
take down that mob with the 2000pt ae fire spell.  I *Want* my 49
fire pet, because fire is my favorite all around pet - and I like 
grouping more than soloing and earth pets are a pita sometimes in
groups (hate it when the root a mob and it can't turn and run).
