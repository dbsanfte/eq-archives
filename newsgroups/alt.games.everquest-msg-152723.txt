    Only the most glaring errors, the ones that people raise a stink about.
The everyday bugs, the "unimportant" stuff like when they broke the damage
healed display, go on being broken day after day. And if the fix actually

remember how long it took before all the "safe spots" in the original game
were removed (assuming they finally got the last one in Cazic Thule)?
