Dont worry about it. When things go south when I'm playing my warrior
I stand and tank and make sure I keep aggro until everyone is either
gone or safely running to zoneline before I (A) die right there on the
spot or (B) make sure I can dash to an easily retrievable spot. Any
warrior worth their salt knows they gotta take the punishment which
will include dying when everyone else gates out. He should only be
pissed if everyone disbands and leaves him to fetch his corpse naked
and alone or if you dont bother to rezz him. (I HAVE been dumped
before after dying.....damn druids nuking when they should heal!)
