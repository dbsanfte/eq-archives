Experience tells me that often half or more of the people who hung
around the gate were travellers looking for a bind and casters who
would hang out briefly to bind a few of them (often expecting a pp
or two in exchange).  On Tunare server, where GFay was the auction
zone, North Freeport was often empty.

Did you bother to read my post?  That is entirely server dependent.
On some servers the only people you saw in NFP were newbies looking
for their NPC Guildmasters 99% of the time.

Both of those options annoy some people, but shouting/oocing was
usually more productive (especially if you offerred to pay for it).

I heard more poor souls ridiculed for begging somebody to come to WFP
from EC to bind them than for almost anything else (when I would play
on Lanys T'Vyl, a server where EC was the auction zone).

Who said anything about spamming?  (besides you that is, speaking from
personal experience are we?)  Getting a melee bound was one of those
things that flat out sucked about the pre-Soulbinder game.  Everybody
knew it was a problem and nobody complained about the occasional shout
or ooc (unless you did it in a zone where you couldn't be bound, like
EC for instance).
