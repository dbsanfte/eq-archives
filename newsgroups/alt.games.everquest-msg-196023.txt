Good choices.

Befallen is always good, traps, trains listen to the people, boss mobs
and loot discipline can be taught there.

I like Dalnir's but its a little rougher of late.

In Droga, I have often dived in there invis in order to get the Fine
cut diamond mask, For training, perhaps you all can do the turn ins
the HARD way. No invis fighting your way in. Little rough but ought to
be fun.
