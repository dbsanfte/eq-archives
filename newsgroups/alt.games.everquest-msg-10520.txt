Well, I scan't speak for being a Necro, as I play a Erudite Wizard myself...
I can tell you about the Warrens though.

They are fun for the first few days, and decent loot for the level... after
that it's time to move on, especially if you want fast experience. My Wizard
started flying through levels as soon as I got off Odus at level 12.

I went to WC and made good money on Wisps and bears, then to Oasis for some
croc action and now I'm in HighPass (good loot, good experience). The
Warrens can be fun, but they aren't the best for leveling, IMO.
