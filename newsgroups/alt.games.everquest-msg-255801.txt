Here Ben, from your own post which I replied to:

the changes were put in for all players, not to "placate casuals", and as
you say, theyre not bad changes, except PC xp.

Lay off the crackpipe Ben.

Are you a broken record? Was faction work so much fun that you would gladly
do it for decades to spite the "casuals"?

You must not have played right after LDON came out, or didnt do any hards.
Hard drops were worth up to 85k for a couple months. Casaul that I am Im a
good chanter so I got inducted into several hard ldon farming groups,
Including a time geared group after HP augs. I took a break at the dx9 deal
& just got back, no idea if it still goes on, but all my raider friends
ditched ldon for god as soon as it came out, so I doubt it.
The fact that raiders can sell trash to casuals is ANTI casual, pro RAIDER,
twit, better deal for the raider. He got it coincidentally, gets to milk the
casual for it.

You were the one ranting how it was a massive conspiracy of the "casuals"
which RUINED the game for you.

I put in quite a bit more time than several raiders I know, and far more
effort during that time as well.
