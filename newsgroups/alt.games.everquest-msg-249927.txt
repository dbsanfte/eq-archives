Then it'd be time to move on and play something else.

Even easier... Make *everything* NO DROP, except for tradeskill 
ingredients and tradeskill items. Make tradeskill items NO DROP 
once they are traded by the original player that crafted them. A 
cheaper, easier and certainly more elegant solution.

Tradeskills still exist, and the economy still exists, for those 
who want to bother with it, but the spectre of players 
perma-camping mobs for cash all but disappears.
