These things are put forward as signs you have played to much EQ.

I have my own signs for this (sorry they're not amusing)

I know I've played too much EQ when I am sick of it and so go and do
something else, yes this happens and probably to a lot of other players, not
just me.

What I don't do is think that's it, I'm cancelling my account, I am never
playing the game again, OMG this is RL, look what I have been missing.
None of those come into my head because, I know I will eventually go back to
it, whether it's weeks or months later and I know full well what RL is, I
may not be as socially active as I once was but I am just as happy now as I
was when I was partying every weekend.

The main thing I found I do irl that came from the net, was from IRC rather
than EQ and I'm sure we've all done it, said (or wanted to say) Laughs out
loud in conversation.
It was when this happened I thought to myself, OMG I'm a geek shortly
followed by an OMG I don't care :ï¿½)
