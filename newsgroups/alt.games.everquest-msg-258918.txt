I finally let go of my Stonekeep box a few years ago. It was the coolest 
box EVAR. I don't really miss the days of the big and weird boxes however.

Yeah, but they didn't go far enough. They should have gone with the DVD 
case and be done with it. I occasionally get DVD-case versions that must be 
imports from the UK or something. I like those far better.

Manuals Schmanuals.  I think a game should teach you to play itself. If a 
game is actually complicated enough that I *need* a manual to play it, I 
generally don't.

That's why we just need DVD boxes. :)
