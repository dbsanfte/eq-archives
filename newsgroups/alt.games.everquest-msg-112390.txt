My guess would be people who have played (eg been billed) continuously
since shortly after EQs initial release.

I am not sure how I feel about the "Legends" players getting in first.
On the one hand it looks like a money grab scheme to get more Legends
subscribers. On the other hand, it might be a bone tossed to those
people that are paying more for legends and not getting the
enhancements that were promised when they signed up. Most likely a
little bit of both.
