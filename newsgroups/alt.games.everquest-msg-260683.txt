1.
As long as no mob in your swarm is faster than you...of course it's
enough. :)

2.
I know at least one mob - Rallus Rattican(sp?) in PoD. He runs slightly
faster than run3 so I have to kite him down using selos. But every
shaman or druid mob should buff itself with sow (horror hobgoblins in
PoN for instance)...even indoors sometimes. And then run3 obviously is
insufficient. :)

3.
For myself I think it's very convenient to have run3. :) It gives me a
usable speed upgrade without going for the full blown selos run. :)
Since I have my epic and instrumental mastery at lvl3 I run at full
speed even without a drum. And I hate circling at selos speed.

4.
Since you are grouping alot you're designated puller most of the time I
guess. So run3 is even a must have. Depending on whether you raid or not
I would level to 56 or even 58 to get the AE resist and regen songs. And
then grinding these 3 AAs. Then further up until lvl63 when you can get
Fading Memories. Don't ignore this AA. It's fantastic!
