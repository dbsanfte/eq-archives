FT makes a much bigger difference than int does. Sure, you want int at 200 or
as close as you can manage, but it's not something I would sacrifice HP for.

In fact pretty much all my gear has been chosen primarily for how much HP it
gives me, other stats add up by themselves. STR and DEX go up quickly without
looking for them, and CHA doesn't make much of a difference until you use
lull in hard LDoNs where it means you don't get aggro on a fail as often
(though bard lull isn't a very good pulling tool in hard LDoNs anyway).
