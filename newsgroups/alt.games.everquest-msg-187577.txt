Seems to me the rats wandering around the first area, close to ZO, stops
assist aggroing at lvl 53.
The normal prisoners in this area stops assisting at lvl 56 and the non
normal prisoner is Sralm Noarmir who seems to jump in on even a lvl 59, so
it is possible he is set at lvl 60, but I have not had a 60 pull in groups I
have been in since the amount of xp for a lvl 60 has pretty much dwindeld
into nothingness.
