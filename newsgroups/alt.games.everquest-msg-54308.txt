I didn't bother logging on my main (was playing my baby necro at the
time) but a bunch of system wide messages came across on Xev last night
indicating that something dire was going down in the Dreadlands. 
Guildmates reported a short time later the the zone crashed. (Typical).
Nothing happened in EC that I saw. I do plan on playing tonight, though,
so I'll see if anything special is up for Halloween night.
