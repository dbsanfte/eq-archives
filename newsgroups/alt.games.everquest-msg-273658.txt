I meant as in a black hole. You cross this line, you can never go back, and
you can't see the line. Good point about the zoning though, zoning out from
the tradeskill instance to graystone, chugging around the terrain and to the
bank and then all the way back (because you have run out of backpack room
and each recipe can produce 3 outcomes that are usable and all may be
desirable) is not fun!

However, wouldn't it be nice if the rewards were usable at the level you
attain them, like as in the tutorial with the feathers and shells? The
butterflies quest doesn't seem attainable within the first 20 levels unless
you twink. The spotted series seem not to drop very much and i've never seen
a spotted yellow, despite a lot of collecting in the t1 zones. Each time,
i've had to buy them, although i've now made a few gold out of
buying/reselling them.

Thanks for the post, this is really useful information. Made me rethink
buying WOW just as i was about to leave for the shop ;-)

I love quests, but i love soloing. I love depth of game, but i don't like
eq2's fiddling with inventory space and overflow all the time. I think i
might like the wow art but i also like eq2 interactivity. It's a hard
choice. Maybe i'll trial it and make my mind up that way.
