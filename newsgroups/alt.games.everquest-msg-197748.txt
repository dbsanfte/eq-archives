You did the extreme diet then.  I did try that for 10 days, lost 15 pounds, 
it worked great, I was miserable.  I am on a low carb diet, not a no carb 
diet.  As far as sugars go, fruits are good, just in moderation, stay away 
from refined sugars, and eat only very moderate amounts of high starch 
foods.  It works well, I slowly lose weight, and am nowhere near as 
miserable.
