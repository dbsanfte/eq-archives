http://everquest.allakhazam.com is your friend.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=153 is a link to the
list of quests in Shadowhaven.  There are several that are good for faction,
Traders of The Haven, Hardam's Goods, Steaon's Deliveries.  I repeated
Hardam's and Steaon's quests 20 times or so, and can now shop anywhere in
Shadowhaven.  Not sure about Echo Caverns off hand, but I'm sure there are
similar quests for that.
