Alright,  I've seen this mentioned often enough, by Monual, Sean
Kennedy, James Grahame, et.al (wooh, namedropping!!), but I was
wondering what exactly it is?

I was on an LDoN assassinate mission the other day, with a higher
group, bringing the average level up over 50, and we got a message
that the target did this at around 15%.  So what exactly does it mean?

(The target's name was Leviticus, some large werewolf dude who handed
us our ass the first two tries at it, mostly due to some adds that
weren't as lulled as the bard said they were.  Not that that means
anything)

Thanks in advance for any information ,
