Yea, the rod itself is cheap, but being about level 12 back then, I didn't 
know that.  Plus, swimming 15,000 /loc units in a straight line might be a 
bit more difficult. :) I think one time when it happened, I luckily bumped 
into a rich necro who insisted on summoning, and the other, there was a GM 
standing on Sister Isle summoning everyone else's corpse when I got back 
there, so I just had him add me to the list. :)
