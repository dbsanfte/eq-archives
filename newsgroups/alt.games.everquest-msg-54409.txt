Once I hit level 8 I gave-up on mele with my Necromancer.  I went
with Erudin as race just for that shorter trip to 200int and then
started swapiing out int gear with resist or HP stuff depending on
situation.

Flayed skin arms are better than gatorscale if I remember right.
Trouble is not all races can wear it. For the money difference I
went with the 4int 2str earrings over the 5 int ones. Also a flayed
skin boots and bracer should not be hard to find (humans can wear it
I think).  Robe of the Oracle is a dime a dozen and 5int 25mana.  It
only looks like hell (not in a good way either).

All that said necro's are a fun class to play for sure.  Loved mine
until I hit 50 then got a bit bored with him. Started a Bard and got
him to 49 and got bored now I have a Ogre Warrior that will likely
live as long  =).
