I get it, even if a lot of other people don't.

I'm a founding member and officer of a raiding alliance on
my server, and although we get a lot of newcomers on our
raids, I've never once begrudged loot to someone just because
it was their first time raiding with us.  If they're there
donating their evening to us, they deserve consideration for
it.

That goes double for cases like you describe, where someone is
doing *us* a favor by coming along and filling in a "must have"
class slot without which the raid probably wouldn't have
gone off at all.

The "longtimers" get more loot simply by virtue of being on
more raids and having more chances at the drops.  We don't need
to turn newcomers into slave labor for X weeks in order to
reward the longtime members for their service.

I've not only been an officer since the beginning, I've been
main tank on 90% of the raids.  Even so, not only do I not mind
other people getting an equal chance at the drops, I'd feel 
highly mortified at ever trying to claim I had more "right" 
to a drop than anyone else.
