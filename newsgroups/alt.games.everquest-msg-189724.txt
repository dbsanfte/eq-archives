Eric Lund vandalized the alt.games.everquest bathroom wall with:

EL> Okay.  I sold a bunch of silk.  Even bought some low priced silk and turned
EL> around and sold it at full price (5pp).  Made a mistake on some purchases
EL> (deity issue), but got them resold and got a bunch of new equipment.  My
EL> wizard is now stronger, quicker, sturdier, smarter, wiser, has extra mana
EL> and hit points, better armor, better weapon, and mostly better resistances.
EL> Cool.
EL>
EL> However, it seems I don't get the same experience I was getting before I
EL> bought all this stuff.  Wandering Greenbloods don't give me experience with
EL> each kill.  Only occasionally (1 in three, last night).  Does all this
EL> equipment change how the game awards experience, or was this some sort of
EL> abberation?

Equipment should have no effect on kill provided you are the same level.
It is possible you happened to get really low level MoB's, thus not giving
you XP.  What was their /con?
