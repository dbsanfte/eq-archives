Actually, I'll go one step farther.  I'm glad Verant decided to make the
most of the technology available.  Instead of going with a half-arsed "It's
on par with what everyone else is doing," they at least decided to do this
part right.

Didn't realize the had gotten -that- cheap.  Dang, I may have to build a
second computer now...  Tunare knows that's gotten easier these days.  No
more jumpers and hardware configured IRQs.

Add to that the fact that not all cards work like they're supposed to on EQ.

Which makes the odd situation that I could go build a near-top system for a
quarter of what my 8088 cost me in the '80s.
