    Don't wander far from the port-in spot. The maze has raptors in it that
are damn-near even cons to your paladin, which see invis. There's also mobs
that cast AoE slows and poison rain AoEs, three waves of 350 damage. And the
usual hitting-fast-for-190 nonsense. I have seen some loot reports, though,
