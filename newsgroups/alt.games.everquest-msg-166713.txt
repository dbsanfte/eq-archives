Hi

Using Wingate 4 I was ok, but since upgrading to Wingate 5 I cant get
Everquest to stay working, it gets tremendous lag thats unplayable. When I
close down Wingate 5 Everquest works ok.

Has anyone got Wingate 5.0 and got Everquest to work ok with it? I really
wanted it to work so my 2 computers can share a line.

thanks
Shirl
