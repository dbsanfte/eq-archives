[Rune assumes a ranting posting style. (Don't I always?)]
Because gnomes RULE, and you know it! There is no cooler player race,
except maybe trolls, of course. BOW DOWN TO MY ARMY OF GNOME AND TROLL
TWINKS! BWAAHAHAHAHA! ... ... ...ahem. Sorry.

But look at them: Gnomes are inherently sexxxy! Admit it, girls, when
you see your favorite gnome, you are overcome with primal urges! I
think it's the receding mullets that attracts them, personally. And
gnomes are dead smart! My warrior has 23 higher Int than Str! Put
that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr. Oooh, I can't be stunned from
the front, have 5khp unbuffed, dumber-than-a-post Ogre!

Of course, as sexy and smart as gnomes are, trolls have them beat.
Just look at Mr. Blackheart over there; he always has that cute
little dwarven cleric following him around, getting him out of
sticky situations. And Lenny, who got hitched to that pretty
shamaness! Trolls get the chicks!

The less said about the barbaric practice of "Offering a gnome
to appease the Raid Gods" the better... Grrr...
