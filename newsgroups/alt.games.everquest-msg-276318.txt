If the buyer hits the hide traders button, he will have no difficulty at 
all picking out the one trader he is interested in.  Seriously, it's just 
not that difficult, and not a problem.  Sure, people are idiots, and feel 
some need to try to crowd out the other traders, but, hide traders 
completely alleviates any problems this can cause, other than for 
browsers, and I never really understood them anyway.  :b
