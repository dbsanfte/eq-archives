Fact is, you can swim invis all the way to Phinny's ledge with no aggro,
and fighting on the ledge won't aggro anything else. Whether you single
pull him or clear the guards first, if you can't even manage that much
do you really deserve to be killing Phinny? It's not like he wasn't easy
enough for a "boss mob" as it was. A totally modest guild just beginning
to work on epics could take him VERY easily with three groups levels
fifty to sixty. (or less). These days he's regularly being done with two
or three people of more ubah flavor. I haven't talked to anyone who's
solo'd him personally, but I wouldn't be shocked if it's been done.
