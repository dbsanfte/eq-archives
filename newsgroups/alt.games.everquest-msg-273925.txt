Here's a cite, just as you asked. Of course, whether you gracefully 
acknowledge it or just continue to deny is still up to you. I'm curious 
whether you'll have the courage to admit you were wrong...or whether 
you're a pussy?

/quote:

The association between women, homosexuality, and cowardice is a very 
old one in our culture. A number of other words show a similar 
conflation of ideas. Sissy was originally a familiar term for sister, 
then a name for effeminate men, and can now be used of cowardly people, 
even if they are women.

Wimp has a similar history. In its earliest use, dated to about 1920, 
wimp was slang for 'woman', and within a few years was being used for 
men who were 'ineffectual, spineless, or feeble'. To wimp out carries 
the idea of failing to take some risk and is pretty much the same as 
being a pussy.

Of course, Miss Poubelle probably does not need to point out to readers 
of The Guide that there are a lot of sexist and homophobic assumptions 
behind these words. The idea that women and gay men are cowards relative 
to straight men is obnoxious. Taunting someone by calling them a pussy, 
wuss, wimp, or sissy always ultimately involves comparing them to a 
stereotypical frightened woman and generally plays on insecurity about 
masculinity. "

Have you ever heard a mob referred to as a "fluffy kitty cat"? No.

Uh... no.
