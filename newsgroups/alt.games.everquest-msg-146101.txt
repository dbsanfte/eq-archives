Oops!  re-read the original post 3x and did NOT catch that "instead"
word.  me bad!  I "read" that he hated Clerics meleeing at all instead of
endlessly sitting and medding between heals.

Yes, hell! I'd leave the group too if the Cleric wanted to ONLY melee.
That's just insane!

I'll have to more carefully read certain posts before I react to them.

My primary role as a Cleric is healer, no question about that!  I just melee
