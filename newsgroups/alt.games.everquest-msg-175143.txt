Ya, but that negates the need to heal people.. so you wouldnt need to find a
way around the silence

Btw, zerging AD: the times we've been succesful, we've had maybe 5% of the
raid killed.. when we did a "kill him before he kills us" zerg, we'd end up
wiping at a painfully low point.. like, 5%

I think all "zerg" mobs have a strat, maybe not obvious, but most certainly
makes it easier..
