Yeah I saw these as low as 1000p recently in the bazaar...oh how times have
changed.  Centi LS + Lammy would be a good combo for a few more levels.

I am using a Bloodpoint (10/21 +proc Siphon) and a Blood Fire (11/24 +proc
Boiling Blood) at L58 that holds aggro nicely except up against some of the
more exotic types...(20k+ weps)
