Oh, yes, tell! tell!  I could do with a good such book myself.

"He's going to tell!
  He's going to tell!
 He's going to tell!

(Sorry.  Was just watching the Holy Grail again the other night. :) )

I'm not a specialist of the study so much... but I did spend quite a while 
hawking tarot decks.  It seemed to me that the satisfaction of the 
practitioner with the experience depended on whether they thought their 
deck was pretty, more than anything else.  So finding a pretty deck may 
influence somewhat which books are most appropriate.

Of course, Rider-Waite and Thoth both have a nice weight of History and 
Tradition standing behind them.  I have some memory of a revised 
Rider-Waite that maintained the symbolism nicely but had less 'cartoonish' 
colors in the art.  Oh, here we go, the Universal Waite deck.  It was just 
re-watercolored, basically.
