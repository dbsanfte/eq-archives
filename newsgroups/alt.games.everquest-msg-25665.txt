What race are you?  Brownies hate everyone, but they hate some more than
others.  I think Erudite are the only non-KOS race to them.

How I got the spells at level 12 as an agnostic Gnome:

1. Cast Alliance on the guard.  This rendered them dubious to me, so they
wouldn't kill me.  But the merchants won't sell to dubious people, so...

2. Walk into the compound, stand next to the merchant, and cast Minor
Illusion.  This set me to indifferent so I could buy.  Why they'd sell to a
talking canopy, I have no idea.

3. Gate out.

Depending on your race, you may have to cast another race illusion before
casting Alliance.

When they added the other mana spells, I was able to do illusion wolf and
just walk in and buy them.
