You could have blown the whole raid by pushing the issue.

Its not just the young and impatient who do these kinda things either...  I
recall a story of yours a while back, where people were hailing an NPC and
told to stop; but you still hailed him, "just incase".

Not only does it cause major spammage!  In some cases it can hinder or end a
raids chances to progress for the day.  The raid leader should be telling
everybody as you progress, what you can expect from each mob/room/portal,
and also how to progress.  If they didn't do this, its bad leadership.

If they delayed in doing it, its more likely because they wanted to fully
recover before starting the portal timer.

As you saw, porting to the next room triggers mobs to start appearing from
the portals (portals are killable btw, to slow down the number of adds), but
it also sets the timer on the portal being active.

Once a portal has reached a set amt of time (of being open) it permanently
closes, no more late comers, no CoH, no more transporting between levels..
imagine if the portal closed, and only 1/4 of your guild was in the room
with Agnarr? :)

Grats on your kill, but remember, each person and moment of impatience takes
1 week off your raid leaders life span :(
