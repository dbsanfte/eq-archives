Tonight on Prexus, I'm cruising along in BBM, typing a message to a
friend, and I ran up the wall near the Dagnors zone. Took about 15
points of falling damage, and was in a uniformly grey area, where the
rain was falling UP.

So, I'm outside the world, obviously, and while the inverted rain is
amusing for the first 3 or 4 seconds, it doesn't really have the kind
of entertainment value required to hold my attention long.

No worries I figure. I just ported into the zone, still have the BB
ring spell memorized, so I cast it. First thing I notice is that the
spell effects are blazingly fast. Second thing I notice is that I'm
looking down on a corpse. Third thing I notice is that it's mine, and
I've just taken 10k falling damage.

Lost my level, port back in again, can't see my corpse anywhere
around. And my graphics are very washed out looking - probably related
to the fast effects somehow.

/petition
/report (to send them the 10k falling damage message)

Run around whacking green goblins with my fists and low end spells. No
point wasting the time, might as well work on faction, after all.

20 minutes later a guide shows up, tells me the /report was decisive
in his decision (take a note of that - if you get killed by a falling
bug, /report yourself with the appropriate text showing). Without it,
I think the fact that my untouched corpse was several miles down would
have sufficed, but it would have taken him longer to make a
determination.

He drags my corpse out of whatever alternate universe it had fallen
into and gives me the full rez. Less than half an hour from start to
finish. I think that's excellent response time.
