    Empty's point is quite a simple one. They've had bugs that effected, for
example, all users of a Creative sound card, or all users of an Athlon
processor. These aren't obscure hardware components, or hardware
combinations. This is stuff that's pretty damn mainstream. Heck, when I got
the first computer I played EQ on, Sound Blaster was the recommended sound
card for EQ. To have a bug that effected SB users at a later date was pretty
crummy testing on their part.
