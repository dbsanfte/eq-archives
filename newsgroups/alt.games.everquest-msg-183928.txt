we don't get them in the UK but I get the idea from GU Comics piss take of
them.

Doubt this kinda of stuff ever happens. Peopel log on at raid times and see
whats up through course of play. No one sits in an office and starts calling
people onthe phone "Hey lets kill the dragon"

The very most we do in our guild is send celluar text messages to people if
we short of a key class.

Be good to see an mpeg of them, anyone got a link?
