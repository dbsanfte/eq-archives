Continuation of your epic quests, exploring new areas, etc. Getting uber 
lewtz like in EQ :)

Actually they do, to an extent. I don't play a caster, so the only 
example I can think of is insta-mez and insta-stun for healers that they 
get at around level 30 (if they specialize in pacification)

They get upgrades to evades/protects/guards/etc., in addition to getting 
new weapon styles. New weapon styles actually can count as new skills, 
since they can possibly create new chains of special attacks

Same reason as why play EQ at high levels -- get uber stuff, get into 
uber encounters, see more monsters. Well, in EQ you can also make an 
army of twinks

Oi, hell yeah

Next epic quest, I'd assume. For me (skald, closest to EQ bard I could 
find), I get evade, and get to wear chain armor, as well as getting 
upgrade to my regen song. 
Healer types get upgrade to their armor. This is actually more important 
than it may seem, since they get to look exactly like tanks, hence 
lessen their chances of being singled out as a target in RvR

In DAOC though, you get something just about at every level. Upgrade to 
a spell line, for example. In EQ, what's there for most fighters between 
20 and 51? Casters get new spell round every 5 levels, and most, if not 
all of those are also upgrades to existing ones.
At 20 pure casters get specialization, which (by level 50) reduces mana 
cost of spells by what, 2-5%?

Oh, by no means am I saying that EQ is bad. There are aspects of it that 
I don't like, and ones that I outright hate. But if it kept me for 2 
years straight, putting over 100 days /played into my characters, then 
there's gotta be something good about EQ :)
