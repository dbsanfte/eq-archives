Its not so much where your running it from... Its more of How much
traffic are you gunna have..   If your going to have a large volume,
your general ISP will have a tissy.   Lets say, your serving movies
from your Home Web site.  each movie is 300 mb in size.   now if you
get one hit a week, it may not be an issue, but lets say you get 300
hits a day or even more..   That will cause the tisssy mentioned
earlier.
Thats why somone earlier in the thread mentioned no graffics, and just
a text based page.

sales rep's always know more than you know... even more about yourself
then you know.  (in case you cant tell... I despise sales people, well
know it all sales people.  One reason I  will NEVER shop at Fry's
electronic's again)
