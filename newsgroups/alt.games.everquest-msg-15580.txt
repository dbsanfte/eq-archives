And it gets worse too. One brilliant group required me to play the mana 
song ONLY. No melee, no healing song "Because it reduces the 
effectiveness of mana song". Mmm-kay. You have druid for your only 
healer, ranger and two warriors, you are fighting giants outdoors, what 
do you fucking mean "no fear song"?! Stupid nimrods kicked me out of the 
group too, to see me solo the bloody things while their poor overworked 
druid was medding for his lil 300 point heal
