Ignored?  Yet you can log on, start killing, get xp, and log off, within 
moments, without having to do anything else?  You asked 'if I want to 
solo, why can't I...'.  As I said, you can.  That appeared to be the 
substance of your post.

Heaven forbid you should argue against the point, and not the person.

Nothing in the game prevents you from soloing now, any more than it did 
when you first started playing (you get less XP in PoP than you used to, 
but the same XP everywhere else that you used to).  I solo'd my 
Necromancer on the beach in Gunthak far more easily than I could have in 
any other zone in the game, at the same level, and that's 'new content'.

What kind of statement was it? My own view, my opinion, my belief, the 
view I hold and put forward when asked.  My belief is that forming 
groups and holding them together takes effort, that effort is rewarded 
(as others have reminded me) with better performance and also, with 
better XP.

But it's a choice, and you're free to choose either way, the 
consequences of that choice have not changed.
