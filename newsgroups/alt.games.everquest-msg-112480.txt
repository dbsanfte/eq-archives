Bah. a.g.e is a very civilized newsgroup in that respect. I used to be a 
regular of rec.arts.sf.written, and there *every single thread* would 
become eventually a gun control flamewar, usually by way of a random "was 
Heinlein a fascist?" post.

In fact, the reason I don't even read that group anymore, in spite of the 
thrill of sometimes having your posts replied to by a few famous writers 
who are also regulars there, is that I simply couldn't cope with the 
eternal flamewars. In fact, that put me off Usenet for years, until I 
subscribed to a.g.e, which remains the only NG I'm in.
