AoF was up last night on CT so me (47 sk) and a 47 druid went on in

went up the temple and kill the static spawns at top, invis'd and went into
the AoF area, went up on the wall and was about to pull a justicar (only mob
in there with aoF and pet) when the AoF agro'd

he HT'd for about 400, stunned me quite a bit, but with a couple heals I
managed to kill him quite easily

he did "not" run, the justicar was still there and did "not" engage in the
melee at all

only dropped the claws, but was a cool little battle :)
