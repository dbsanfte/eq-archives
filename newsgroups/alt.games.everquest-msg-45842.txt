What I did was to hang out by the lake in front of the sarnak fort.
Park the pet by the lake "/pet guard here" and then go and pull
something using darkness so it arrives slowly. Run back to the
pet. There are less mobs by the lake shore so it's a bit safer.

Also, you're not far from the frontier mountains zone like there so
if an extra joins in the fight, just bravely abandon the pet and
run for the zone. 9 times out of 10 I made it.
