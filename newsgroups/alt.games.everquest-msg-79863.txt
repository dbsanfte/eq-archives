I'm suddenly having the same problem with one of my three EQ
systems.  I've tracked it down to a problem with the texture
caching files (over several EQ runs they get truncated to
zero length).  This works for me, see if it makes a difference
for you:

  Go to your EQ directory and erase all *.txc (texture caching)
  files.  Then go to the Options screen and turn off the
  Texture Caching option.

I'm trying to figure out why this one system has that problem,
it's nearly a carbon-copy of one of the other systems which
is having no problems at all, and I've done CRC checks only
file in the EQ directory to ensure that they're running
the same EXE, DLL, zone files, etc.  The eqclient.ini file
options are all the same too.  Strange.
