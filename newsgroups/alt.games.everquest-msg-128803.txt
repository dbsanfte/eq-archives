so the killing of 1000+ palestinians is justified?  the major U.S. networks
seem to disagree.. they refuse to show the total number of Palestinian
deaths.

There is no excuse for killing 1000+ people, and oppressing many more...no
matter what history says.
The chain of war has to stop somewhere.... and isreal is doing a lousy job
by oppressing and violating the human rights of the Palestinians (according
to the U.N.).

As far as ignorance is concerned, i'm not the one who ignores teh deaths of
1000+ palestinians and offers arguments without any kind of support.
