Its a right click, but doesn't work till after you can cast
the spell, IIRC, something silly like level 45.  If the cast
time wasn't so long it would be handy, not ever having
to use a spell slot to mem atone.  As it stands, I've never
found a use for the thing, really need to remember to sell
it someday.
