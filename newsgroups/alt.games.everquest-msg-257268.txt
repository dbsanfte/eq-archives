I think it has been an interface problem more than anything else. Other 
games have been much more engaging with their text dialog. Stuffing NPC 
dialog into the same scrolling window as everything else was probably a 
bad idea.

You only have to hand in some 5000+ bone chips, 4 at a time, to faction 
in cabilis. Let the good times roll... 

Important NPCs, and Epic quests; they can have a voice overs... but if 
every goblin and orc has a death message, or if I have to listen to 
Trooper Mozo taunt me 1000s of times about my ability to kill skeletons 
I'm going to be ill.

I am going to miss NPCs that know my name though.
