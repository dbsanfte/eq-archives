Head - Don't know the helm you mention, but when I was growing up, Skull
Shaped Barbutte was standard equipment. 

Rings - Depends on funds, but 2ac isn't worth it. Either get Jagged
Bands or Plat/Velium Fire Opal rings, as your bank account allows

Ears - You're pretty well set with cougar

Face/Neck - smithed Fine Plate is always good for these slots. Could
probably do the collar of the storm quest in Kael with a few friends too

'Body' armour - Lots to list here - best let someone around your level
give more insight, as the playing fiend has changed from my 40s pre-
Kunark/Velious. I'm pretty sure you could get loot some decent things
while exping, as well as pick up some absolute bargains in ECo if you
have a little cash
