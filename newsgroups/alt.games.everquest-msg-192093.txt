The chance to get hit didn't change, but previously the monk had the
ability to mitigate damage naturally.  This means the monk could
naturally reduce the amount of damage he/she would normally take from
the attack.

Problem with that is they were taking less damage overall than the
tank/plate classes, which isn't right.  Don't get me wrong, I loved it
(got a 55 monk myself) but it never should have been that overpowering
in the first place.
