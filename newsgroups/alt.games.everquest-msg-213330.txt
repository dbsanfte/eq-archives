Cleric purify (targetable) was originally better than my monks purify (self
only)

With the re-use change, the gap has increased yet again.  With the so-called
melee-balancing still not here, melee is STILL falling even further behind

You think celestial is still an "get it when I have everything else" skill?

From the few raids I've done since this change went live, the new celestial
heal has gimped every single AE encounter I've come across. From wise to
blazz to PoP gods.  The change is huge, and it is a better spell than Sotw

How about the classes who DO need balancing, and their useless AA's.  They
are still useless.

Ohh AC!!  DS!! Come on James, you know neither of these matter for shit
versus AE-casting mobs
Do clerics even mem EE anymore, let alone cast it?  They won't anymore with
this AA change.  Torpor isn't going to be used in this situation anyway.

As for SE/Quies - yes its a pain, but the main use of these is healing
against the AE damage anyway.  So, 6 casts of SE/Quies, or 1 manaless MGB
that does the same job?

They had a great AA skill, now its second rate versus your longer duration,
faster re-cycling version.

Im not one to whine about others powers and my weakness bla bla.. but this
change was totally un-needed IMO
