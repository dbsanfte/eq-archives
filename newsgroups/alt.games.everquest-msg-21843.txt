I actually had him following me around, and when I got bored I attempted to zap
him with some of Brell's holy Wraith.... Didn't take, it was almost as if he
was someones pet.   On the flip side, I saw some rouge take him down just fine.
 I wonder if it's some sort of code sneaking over from Sullon Zek.  You know,
Evil's can kill the little bugger, but goodies can't?  
   I'm sure that I'm wrong, but I KNOW I tried casting on him and couldn't.  I
even tried to Atone the little bugger to make him forget me and it didn't work.

Regards
