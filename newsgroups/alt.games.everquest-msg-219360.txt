Well, trade skills are valuable in that they allow you to create
valuable items from other items.  Apparantly it offends the gods
of EQ to have this work in terms of sales to NPCs, which makes
sense in a way as it becomes an infinite wealth generator if you
allow it, any time one gets discovered that -is- profitable SOE
eventually finds out and "corrects" it by killing the
profitability somehow.

So if you still want to create valuable items, they must be
valuable to players instead.

But if skills are extremely easy to get, then there are no
customers, because anyone who wants an item made can simply make
it himself.  Even if they are merely slightly difficult, so that
only 50% of the population bothers (see magician research, as an
example) then there is far too much competition selling items to
make it worth while... unless the "while" is so trivial, as in
the case of Research, that its just another curiousity.

Ideas that I find interesting are ones where you put exp into
trade skills a la AA points; that way you'd be sacrificing
-something- to be a trade skiller.  Or make the trade skill items
worth money to vendors, but only ones based on drop items; that
way you turn drops into something more valuable and then sell
that, locking in a floor value for items thats missing now; at
the moment anything you make is in danger of becoming obsolete as
better and better "mudflation" stuff drops as the game matures. 
Or give you free trade skill points as you level, but you have to
pick where to put them, so you can be a jack of many trades or
master just one; then rely on other trade people to get you all
the different trades.  And adding in something to every trade
skill that is made at low and moderate skill levels thats useful;
like SOW potions or Leather Padding etc, giving people a reason
to work at the low end as well as just at the very apex.

I don't know that any of those would really work all that well, I
just think they are interesting compared to the current
situation, where you slave like a dog for weeks of real time,
spending tens of thousands of pp before you can finally make the
few items that are currently in demand... and then hope they
-stay- desirable while you spend more weeks clicking away
insanely trying to not only make your initial expenditure pay
off, but also make actual profit so you don't feel like you
wasted all that time.
