    You are cordially invited to attend my wedding 
Sunday the 26th of August at 6 pm Pacific Time in
Nro at the docks near the pirate (Frankle?) on 
Drinal server.
   Tealeef the Barbarian will be marrying Lennaman
the Troll.  All characters, good or evil, are 
welcome.  Wedding presents are not expected; we
just want people to have a good time.  Level 1
wedding mules are certainly welcome.  This spot 
is near Freeport, and not too many MoBs wander by 
the beach so all should be safe enough.

Annie   <--- Now has to go /auction for some Cake.
