They won't be. The lowest one will be about jboots speed for 9k (level
9 sow speed basically)
There will be at least one a bit faster but you can bet that neither
is as fast as even a level 40 sow. They said somewhere they won't be
as fast as players with speed as part of their class. 

You are mostly paying for the horsie graphic ;)

Oh and the answer to the other question, about how a horse is
different than sow, is that my druid doesn't get paladin abilities.
Sow is a part of the classes who get it and that is the exact reason
verant has more or less stated as to why all other means of speed such
as jboots are no where near as good and why as a druid I don't get an
item that clarities me even if it cost 10 k plat from some gnome
vendor. Verant has just never liked to do that, giving one class the
abilities of another.

I guess if only the pally and sk get the horsie and it takes a bunch
of xp at 50 plus its still kind of balanced though, as long as the
horse is not that fast. I wonder if their horses get a slightly
different texture also? That would be kick butt if the sks horse
actually looked evil.
