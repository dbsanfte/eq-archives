A common complaint from certain people who post here is about people
who truncate or abbreviate certain words such as "PLZ" rather than
"please" etc. The (almost) universal conclusion that these
complainants arrive at is that the PLZ merchants (for want of a better
name) are cerebrally challenged.

If you are one such person, has it ever occured to you that the PLZ
merchant is accustomed to using such abbreviations elsewhere online
such as IRC or even text-messaging on mobile phones? Does this
instantly make them an idiot? 

<hint>The answer you're looking for is "no".</hint>

To me, "Can I have a SoW please" and "Can I have a SoW plz" are
identical and interchangable. They are reducing the number of keys
they press in their request. Does this make them somehow less polite?

<hint>The answer you're looking for is "no".</hint>

I have been using computers since...hmmm... 1981/1982, and in that
time, I have come a long way since my 2-finger-typing days. Does that
mean that everyone interested in MMORPGs should be able to rattle off
a complete sentence in 2 seconds before being allowed to log on?

<hint>The answer you're looking for is "no".</hint>

If you disagree with this line of thought, tell me why it is so much
more allowable to have people say "SoW" when (by your logic) they are
being impolite by not saying "Spirit of Wolf" each and every time?

Person A: "Can I have a SoW please?"

Person B: "Can I have a Spirit of Wolf plz?"

Who is the more polite?

Personally, when I feel the need for a SoW (for whatever reason) I
will approach the shaman/druid and say something along the lines of;

"Excuse me, kind sir, might I trouble you for a SoW? I am a weary
traveller with many miles ahead of me ere the end of my journey."

The exact wording will depend on which character I am playing and what
class/race I am asking. This is largely because I enjoy roleplaying.
That is my choice. I don't enforce my idea of correct wording on
others who approach me.

For instance, my shaman will happily SoW someone who asks "Can you plz
SoW me?" whereas she will steadfastly refuse to SoW someone who
*demands* to be SoWed or assumes that it is my purpose in life to
serve them. This type of person doesn't say "please" and they don't
say "plz".

It is the *thought* behind the words which matter, not the actual
wording. If you insist that others stop using "plz" simply because
(whilst being polite) they typed 3 characters less than *you* would
have liked, try putting yourself in their shoes.

If everyone you asked for SoW refused because you didn't spell out
"Spirit of Wolf", would you thank them for putting you on the straight
and narrow or would you think them an anal-retentive twat and go
elsewhere?
