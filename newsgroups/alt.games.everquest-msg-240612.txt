I hear what your saying but....

If I die deep in Seb, shortly before my ISP goes down, 2 days before a
2 week business trip to Europe gets rescheduled and moved up because
the Ambassador to Germany won't be available the original planned
weeks after all...then I'm a whiner pure and simple? Oh ... right... I
shouldn't be playing in Seb a few days before an unplanned 2 week trip
to Europe... because of the possible lasting consequences an
unexpected ISP snafu could have...

Or perhaps if I die deep in the PoFimmediately prior to being summond
for active duty overseas because Pakistan has just elevated
hostilities with India... Oh right.... I shouldn't be playing in the
PoF when there is political instability in the world...

Ergo I deserve to lose everything I have.,. and am a whiner pure and
simple if I disagree.

I think a GY corpse should be non-rezzable, and GY spawning should be
at least a real-time day. That doesn't dumb down the game
significantly, and isn't really abusable.

I can't beleive anyone would really advocate that its right to wipe a
character clean, costing a player years of progress, simply because
the Real World got in the way for a couple weeks.
