After I was more than a death into 54, I put 100% into AA till I got Run 1.
Then I put it all back into real exp, and pushed hard for 56 level, that 96%
rez seemed far more important than any skill other than outrunning the mobs.
At this point I'm well into 56... maybe I need to take a look around and
start towards doing more AA now, but then there's 57 spells and hp and
lower mob resist and higher level based spell effect, all sitting there just
9 blue away :)
