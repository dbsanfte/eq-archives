This is my first post and basicly its just to say hi and to introduce
myself.

I am new to both these groups and everquest itself, i have only been playing
everquest for 3 months and i am enjoying it, yes i am a newbie and as such i
dare say there are things i have done that are probably not the best wasy
but on the whole i belive that i do my best and to be as helpful as i can. I
play a wood elf druid and this weekend manged to get him through to lvl 32.

I have been lurking on this newsgroups for about a week and decided that it
was time for stop lurking and come out into the light.

My experances of everquest have mostly been good, yes there have been people
i have meet and thought that if that is what people are like then i might as
well give up, however for each one of those i have meet i have meet at least
5 that are helpful and willing to show newbies around or give them a hand.
As such now i have reached a good level if for any reason i am in a newbie
area i will buff and heal anyone arround that is see. As well as the odd
drive by sow/buff.
As a druid yes i get a fair number of tells asking for sow's and port and if
i am not doing anything i will gladly port people and sow them, i rarly
charge for ports and if i do its because i need the pp for spells. I dare
say we have all meet the type of people like the one earlier about greedy
looters but for the most case i find 99% of the people that i have grouped
with are helpfull and quite willing to share loot, one group i was in were
doing free for all looting with auto split off but understod that as the
main healer/buffer i was too busy medding to worry about geting to the loot
and arranged that no matter what other people were looting every 6th corpse
i could loot and they kept track for me. It is this type of people that make
the game worth playing, and now mean that my friends list is full and i am
if i go to an area i have been to before looking for a group i nearly always
get tells from people i have grouped with before asking me to join them.

Anyway to sum up, i have had some good information of this newsgroups and
have decied that it is time i put something back into them. I will help out
where i can and with my limited knowledge but i will try my best.
Thanks again for all the help you have been
