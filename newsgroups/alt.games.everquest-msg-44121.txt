I did, back when the loot there was something a level 30 would actually
want. 

That's the way things used to be, before the more or less inevitable
mudflation destroyed the value of almost all the drops. It wasn't as
easy to get a group there as it was in frontier mountains, but it was
possible. Required a bit of a learning curve (non aggro healers never
run out of mana, if you don't know what is healing the mob you are
fighting, move it to a wall with nothing on the other side). Was as much
fun as anything I ever did in EQ.

Verant, presumably, recognises that the main advantage EQ has over DAoC
is that it already has 2 expansions full of zones out there, whereas
DAoC will be barely bigger than original EQ even if they add all the
planned zones by launch. This means that a few months after launch, if
it is remotely successful it will be as crowded as EQ was back then
(maybe more so, as the anti-camping code will mean that a group will
need a lot more space to operate).

But that advantage is lost if noone ever visits all those extra zones,
and just squeezes into the one or two easiest ones per level.

So Verant want to restore the status quo by putting in good level 30
loot in places like Kaesora. They know that if they just upgraded the
drops, they would be farmed by higher levels until they were no longer
desirable, with no net result except further mudflation (i.e. everyone
level 30 would have a 8/21 or better weapon instead of 7/21, worsening
the problem it was trying to fix).

So they come up with TCC, a flawed solution to a real problem.
