Honestly, I'm not sure.  Server consolidation comes to mind immediately,
but that seems like treating the symptom rather than the disease.  SOE
needs to identify and cure the disease, but honestly, I'm not sure that's
possible in EQ anymore.  Between the Bazaar, the PoK, mudflation, loss of
players, abandoned content, broken expansions, broken upgrades, etc...

I'm hoping WoW can capture some of the old EQ magic, or maybe even EQ2,
but I'm wary of EQ2 because it's being run by the same people as EQ.  I'm
afraid it'll have the same flaws, but with luck, they've learned a bunch
from EQ...
