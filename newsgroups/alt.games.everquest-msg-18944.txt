Save up. You should be able to get enough to buy a Velium weapon from
someone for 10pp or so, and it *is* possible to save up that much at
level 7. Kill some wisps and sell the greater lightstones (you need
magic to hit them so if you can't do it with spells, get a mage to
summon you a norent weapon), or hunt animals and sell the pelts, sell
stacks of bonechips and batwings etc...

All these fetch next to nothing from vendors but OK money from players
(eg, on Morell Thule they go for about 7pp for a GLS, 2pp for a stack of
bones/batwings, 1-2pp for a quality pelt, 15pp for an HQ bear skin).

When you have a few pp, try just auctioning to the zone in Qeynos Hills
or somewhere - 'Newbie Barbarian Shaman would like to buy a weapon
better than a rusty mace - I can afford up to x pp' - someone will
probably take pity on you and just give you a bronze or fine steel
weapon that they were going to dump on a vendor. I know I would if the
person seemed genuine and wasn't just begging (i.e. looking to buy
something rather than '/ooc Need good weapon. plz!!! give me stuff!!!')

Velium weapons have the same stats as fine steel but are magic so you
can hit wisps, ghouls etc, and they also have a 12point direct damage
proc (this doesn't go off until you hit level 25 by which time it is a
pretty crappy spell, and you should have found something better, hence
they are junk to anyone high enough level to actually get them as loot).
Most players are happy to offload them for anything more than the 5pp or
so they'd get from a vendor. The catch is finding someone who has
actually bothered to cart a bunch of heavy weapons back from Velious
rather than just dumping them on a vendor there - hanging around at
druid rings/wizzy spires may be a good bet - Blackburrow/Qeynos and
environs are a bit out of the way with regard to teleport points so
they're not exactly a travel hub for high level players...

If you happen to be on Morell Thule, give Elidar a tell and I'll try to
help you out.
