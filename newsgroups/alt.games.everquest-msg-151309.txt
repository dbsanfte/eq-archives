Instead of watching the civilisation develop, get a keyboard cover.  You 
  buy a form from your favorite electronics store(I went to Office 
Depot) and it asks all kinds of questions about your keyboard, what 
kind, what are the numbers on the bottom etc.  YOu send in the completed 
form and a few days later you get a custom fitted keyboard cover.  Only 
took 3 days to get mine and it fits perfectly.  Doesn't change the feel 
of the keys at all.  I went through 3 keyboards before I bought the 
cover,my computer is set up in the living room in a high traffic area, 
we get alot of spills from my 12 year old.  Sure wish I had bought one 
for my first keyboard.
