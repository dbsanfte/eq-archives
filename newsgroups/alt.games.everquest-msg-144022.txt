If you don't mind taking big faction hits in HPH/HK/Freeport (I think
Qeynos too, not sure), take out the guards in HK.  Find a tank to duo
with and hunt the guards.  They drop good cash (8 gold to 4pp each),
and each drop fine steel short swords that can be sold for about 4pp
each.  I did that from 30-39, and it was awesome exp.  Captain Bosec
spawns fast and gives the best exp of them all.
