Ok... quite frankly I thought the first one was a *lot* better.  That's kind
of a letdown because I went into this one thinking it would be better than
the first.  But they *really* mangled the plot, and not for the better,
IMHO.  They make out Faramir to be something of a self-serving bastard, not
to mention cruel to Gollum (I mean, you gotta feel sorry for the little guy,
ugly and nasty as he is), when actually Faramir was one of the best and
coolest characters in the book.  And they made the Ents a little too dumb,
though they did well with them otherwise.  I mean, look.  The Ents are the
spirit of Fangorn forest.  It's utterly ridiculous that they would have no
clue what the orcs were doing to their forest until da smart li'l hobbit
went an' showed 'em.  Otherwise they were cool though.  And they had all the
elves going away to Valinor *before* the war, like they were running away
because they were scared or something... instead of sticking around and
trying their damndest to save the world they helped to make before taking
off, like they did in the book.

Also I've got a sneaking suspicion that they're saying bye-bye to Arwen for
good so they can make Aragorn fall in love again and have some more
tear-jerking plot twists with that (not very pretty at all) girl who plays
Eowyn.  And all that stuff Elrond was spouting about how she'd have to watch
Aragorn die and live forever miserable... well, I guess you have to read the
book to dislike that part, but anyway... Arwen is halfelven, just like Agent
Daddy.  Halfelves get to pick whether they want to live forever and go to
the Halls of Waiting (Mandos) if they get killed, or be human, have long
lives but still be mortal and then go do whatever it is humans do when they
die (JRRT was never very clear on that point, he kind of implied it was
something humans aren't supposed to know, which I guess he figured to
include his readers :) ).  And how exactly do they explain "I choose a
mortal life" with "you'll live forever and be mizzible, come be with Agent
Daddy, please, please!"  I mean, I kind of thought "mortal" means you die...
right?

Speaking of which... Galadriel, Arwen, and Eowyn, in that order, were
supposed to be three of the most beautiful women in the world.  So, to play
these three beautiful women, they pick:  Cate Blanchett, sometimes pretty,
more often plain, and occasionally downright ugly.  Liv Tyler, mildly
beautiful but not particularly stunning.  And
whatever-her-name-was-the-actress-I've-never-seen-before who's really plain,
kinda peaked, y'know, I worry about the lass sometimes, but she ain't no
Eowyn, I think she killed th' real one an' took her place when th' king was
possessed an'all (another thing that did not happen in the book, btw, though
I suppose I can live with that particular mangulation).

Oh, yeah, and by the way.  The guy who plays Haldor (the elf who first meets
the fellowship in Lothlorien and who brings the elves to Helm's Deep) is, to
use Neil Gaiman's expression, "gayer than a tree full of monkeys on nitrous
oxide."  Yup, folks, in case ya didn't notice... the guy's FLAMING.

Ok... whew... had to get all that off my chest.  But now I should point out
that it's really an awesome movie nevertheless :)  Yeah, a few cheesy parts
and not as good as the first... but still awesome.  I'll be seeing it again
and I'll definitely be seeing the third one when it comes out :)
