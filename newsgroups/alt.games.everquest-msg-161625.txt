Actually, we've also tried a complete libertarian style, hands off
government as well.  It led both the UK, and the US to the excesses of the
Dickens era industrial revolution.  A complete Laizze Faire attitude toward
social problems and commerce gives free reign to ONE equation...  Power gets
you money, and money gets you more power.  The result is not democracy, but
plutocracy, with almost all of the country's wealth concentrated in the
hands of a few, and everyone else basically in one giant service industry to
wait on them.  We're almost back to this already.

Of course, you could start slinging names at anyone that wants the
government to interfere at all for the good of its society, calling it
socialism or communism.  The same could be done at your views, aligning them
with the social darwinism and elitist plutocracy of their times...

The REAL answer lies in the middle somewhere, and should be judged by
results, not labels.
