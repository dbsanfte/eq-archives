Best to do so near your bind point in case the falling damage is
greater than you anticipated (and you die).

As an Erudite Mage bound in Toxxulia Forest, jumped off the upper
teleport platform in Erudin near the zone line, did 174 points of
damage (I had 178, I was a bit surprised, LOL). Bind wounds up to 50
percent, then nuked myself back down to near zero -- easier to
initially get below 50 percent by jumping rather than nuking myself --
which was safer<G>.

If you're 10 or under, you don't lose xp for miscalculations.
