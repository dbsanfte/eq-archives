Your thought exercise for the day. How do you work this combination in 
two different scenarios. Necromancer Cleric.

First situation, the two are the same level, or very close to it, 
starting in the low twenties.

Second scenario. Cleric is low forties, just barely able to group with 
big necro, who is low sixties.

How do you set up to make some solid xp with this pairing?

I'm thinking, for the first, that the cleric pretty much buffs the crap 
out of the pet, and heals it, letting the pet tank while the necro tries 
to keep the mobs rooted, dotted, and lifetapped. If things are going too 
easily (since a necro can solo that way anyhow) the cleric can toss in 
some nukes to speed up the kill rate as mana allows.

Second scenario.... I honestly haven't a clue. I don't know how 
effectively a cleric twenty levels below the pet could help it. The 
mobs, in order to be blue to the necro, would likely be red to the 
cleric and shrug off his nukes. Healing never hurts though, I guess.

I'm sure there's some brilliant strategy for this pairing that I'm not 
seeing.
