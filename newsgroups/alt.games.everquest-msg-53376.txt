Heck, you don't even have to technically GO on the raid. Hang around
when a larger guild kills the ubergiants, find out who their main
assist is, and plink an arrow or low-aggro spell at the giants, and
try to avoid drawing aggro of your own (ie. do not piss off the wrong
giant at the wrong time, the right giant at the wrong time, sit at the
wrong time, that kind of stuff)
