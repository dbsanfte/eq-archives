/agree LB.

The one area I think you do *benefit*, however, is the fact that you
can kill many more mobs without the risk of running OOM = more
increases in xp and less setbacks from dying = faster levelling.

Not that I give a giant plague rat's a** about faster levelling, but
there are those that do. Personally, I hate it when my skills lag
behind my level. PL'ed a WE druid like eight levels once (to get to 14
for SoW) almost exclusively on CB belt questing and ended up deleted
the char before making 15.
