I have not had a single crash on my Linux box in the 6 months it's been 
running.  I have restarted it 3 times, twice due to power failures in the 
building, and the third time when I replaced hardware.  In that time I 
have had quite a few crashes on my XP boxes, which are much, much more 
stable than my XP boxes were previously.  
If it were not for EQ, I would have been running Linux on my primary box 
long ago.  Unfortunately, my damn EQ addiction is strong, and I accept 
that I have to have at least one good Windows box.
I get the strong impression that you haven't used Linux at all.  It 
certainly has the reputation of a difficult and arcane OS, but the reality 
is that it's no more difficult to run than whatever flavor of Windows you 
use.  It was damn difficult a couple of years ago, but it really is a 
different beast now.  If you have a spare computer, or even a spare couple 
of Gigs of HD space on your regular computer, buy the latest version of 
RedHat at your bookstore and install it.  (This assumes that you can 
install Windows, if you can't install Windows you need more computer 
skills.)
