Bryan,

Nevermind it.  It's now abundantly clear that you live solely for the sake
of arguement.  -Nowhere- had I defamed or insulted you (unless you have an
ackward interpretation of words), however, you decided to rebut and insult
me.  <shrug>  Doesn't bother me in the least, since you mean absolutely
nothing to me.  You are just another person of -many- others.

Arguing is one thing Bryan, but, put-downs and name calling is another.
Perhaps I should rephrase what I said.

"Non-Intellectual (the put-downs and name calling type) arguements will
break down the moral and through of one another in this world, let alone the
US.   Intellectual (the non-put-down and non-name calling type) will keep
this worlds moral, let alone the US afloat."

How's that?  I hope it will suffice, since I will not be checking replies
from you.  Not because I'm "stubborn" or believe that "I am right on
everything," but because you choose to go into the "intellectual" stab's and
name calling.  I haven't the respect for you that I do for others.
