I haven't been following the Annie vs. Ben debate, so I can't comment
on that.  However, as a long-time mostly-lurker on a.g.e, I can easily
recognize that some of the regulars hold a kind of special status, and
Annie is one of them.

Therefore, Ben, I recommend you allow this thread to expire.  Annie is
one of those folks you can't win against, because regardless of whether
you're right or wrong, or whether Annie is right or wrong, this weird
debate will turn into AGE vs. Ben, due to Annie's special status here.
