Actually, you're propagating a myth here that I'd like to refute. How
many L60's do you know? Most of the ones I know have at least one if
not more twinks they play when they aren't doing high level raids. It
was the same when the cap was 50. In fact, I'd say I know way more
people who quit EQ from the tedium of leveling to 60 than that quit
after attaining 60. 

The whole finish the game and quit thing is a myth propagated by Verant
to justify the difficulty.
