I'd put up a Mac versus a Wintel any time for stability. Esp if I've
done the configuration of it. Whilie I WILL say Win2K was a HUGE
improvement to stability, it has it's own issues. Esp as a game
machine, which you have to take into account since this is an EQ
discussion forum. :) It still isn't as stable as the Mac overall. And
don't even start me on any of the earlier Wintel iterations. XP is
good, but still bothered by the 16 bit legacy of Win95. I personally
have XP on my system because I feel it grants me the greatest
flexibility. If I could get the software availability on either
Linux/Unix or Mac, I'd be running one of those for the stability. But
I'm a game junkie, so I'm on Wintel. It's the Ford Escort of the
computer world. Sure there are millions of iterations of it, but that
don't make it best. :)
