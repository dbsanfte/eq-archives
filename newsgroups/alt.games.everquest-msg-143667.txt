Theres a spot to the east of large raptor that is safe to med on. There are
8 spawns on large raptor... 4 static raptors, 2 static big raptors, and 2
wandering raptors. I wait till I can see the one wanderer near the east end
of the island, as well as the static on the se. ensnare them both. Ensnare
the one near the druid ring, watch you dont get to close to the big raptor.
I usually get the fourth raptor from the sw of the island, giving me 4
normal raptors. They wont help one another at 56, but they will agro on your
still.  I usually go out to sea, south of the island and around to the sw to
pull this one. brine them up to the east end of the isle and quad them
around there, and keep your eyes out for the other wanderer. Once youve dont
the first quad, there are 4 left, so its easy. 2 of these are big raptors.
Its easier if you keep the 2 big raptors in the same quad.

One annoying thing they do, is when theres only one left, it will appear
back at its spawn point, but still damaged. Just dot, and repeat.

Small raptor is pretty easy. There are 5 static raptors, a wandering raptor
and a big static raptor. Just try and get the wanderer in your first quad.
One of these static raptors is actually on the NE of big island, but it is
considered part of small, since large already has 8 spawns.

Get a KEI first, even at 100p a shot it makes sense. Not only will you kill
faster, but youll be able to keep the spawn broken and not have to bother
with adds or kiting in tiny areas. 100p is only 2 ports or 20 mins in RM
afterall.
