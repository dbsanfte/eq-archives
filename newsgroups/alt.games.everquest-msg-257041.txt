WHile I haven't done this as a macro, it should work, I used to use much 
the same strategy to loot mobs as a mage.  Note the pet doesn't have to 
be yours, as long as there's a pet in the kill.

Loot Macro
/Target pet
/assist
/loot

This works because unless you've moved on to a new target, a pet keeps 
the corpse of the last thing it was attacking as its target.  You have 
to change the  name of the pet to the correct name, I think, because I 
don't think there's a macro command for targetting a pet generically.

If you're a beastlord its easier because your pet's name never changes. 
  Same is true if you regularly group with the same beastlord.

Might need a pause in there before the assist so your target has time to 
change to pet.

And as far as I know you still have to click the loots off the body 
yourself, no way to automate that step.
