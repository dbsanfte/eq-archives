I suggest trying it some more.  I just tried it (home today) and in 7
out of 8 tries the counts agreed (with classes where you would expect
high-level anons, such as clerics and druids).  In the one that
didn't, when I ran the first query again the number was greater,
meaning more people HAD logged on.  A lot of people can log on in a
few seconds when you have thousands on a server.
