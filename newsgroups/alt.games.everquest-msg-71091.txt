Actually, Fungi Tunic DOES reduce downtime significantly to those who
know what they are doing.  My twinkie was running around with a Fungi
Tunic until he got his cobalt.

Keep in mine the health regen is constant.  Fighting, sitting, binding
wounds, whatever.  It's always healing mana free.  

Think of it this way, say you're a melee class.  Have someone cast
regrowth on you (15hps/tick), now go fight.  Then do the same thing
without regrowth.  See if that makes any significant difference.

Even at level 55, there is a very noticeable difference in terms of
downtime.
