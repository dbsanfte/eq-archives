well, in retrospect it would have been better if they'd done it like
it is now done in FFXI. It should have all been auction "dumping" of
items under your name so you did not have to really be there at all to
sell, with any stall letting people get to the auctioned items (like
in FFXI where you click on the auction area to access it.)

That also fixed the lag problem. FFXI just did it in a real smart way.
