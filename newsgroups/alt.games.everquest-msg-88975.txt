LOL I thought the idea of wedding settings was some idyllic setting...not a
ruined castle like Crushbone. Oh well maybe it was where they first met.
As for expecting everyone to shut up, just demanding that is a sure fire way
of getting the channels spammed by someone. I've yet to see an EQ wedding so
I don't know how they'd normally go down but I am certain those involved
normally don't expect the rest of the zone to stop just for them.
Looks like you run into a bunch of idiots (easily done in Crushbone, as I
have now seen) I hope you just ignored the fact they were there and got
about your business (btw crushbone is a poor choice of place to p/l anyone,
as I also found out)
