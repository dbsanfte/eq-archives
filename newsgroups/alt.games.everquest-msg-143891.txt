Could someone explain to me about Critical hits and how they work. I have
fought in groups and seen the message XXXX scores a critical hit for *****damge
(or words to that effect).
I also came across a reference in a guide to critical hits for Paladins. I play
a Paladin and have never seen a message to say that I have scored a critical
hit.
