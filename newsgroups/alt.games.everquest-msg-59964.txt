No, those people have absolutely NO fucking idea what is important for
a tank to tank mez a mob.

Instead of opting for a pair of AC6/65hps rings, fucking idiots will
get rings with +STR/DEX/AGI or whatever the hell except for what
matters.

THOSE are the reasons why they can't tank for shit.  Not because there
isn't an abundance of solid equipment, but because morons don't know
what stats ARE important.

For those, I have *ZERO* sympathy and the faster they die off the
better off everyone else is.

Level 51 is average tank you see in Velk?
What crack are you smoking?

The average tank in Velk is level 54/55.  Against those spiders, the
tank could be in banded and still be able to tank them.

You think that's unusual?
Generally on most servers, there's only two or three top end guilds.
Those are the guilds that can clear ToV, kill Tormax, kill Dain, kill
all first broods.

This is the same on my server.
