When Hooked on Phonics first came out, a friend of mine got it for her
kids. Imagine my surprise to find out that our school used the same
system in 1st and 2nd grade, at least. I'm having a brain dead morning
now and can't remember what it was called then, but if you remember
doing reading lessons and going to a box that had plastic booklets
of one or two pages that was sorted by colors, that's what Hooked on
Phonics is (or at least was a few years ago.) You read the booklets,
answered the questions asked and moved on to another booklet or the
next color.
