Could you elaborate a bit?

Even if it meant that my weaponsmith would need 10 sandpaper to make a
lumber and another 10 to make a staff, it would still be 10-20 times cheaper
than to buy them from a woodworker or carpenter on the free market.

In theory, that upper limit should be decided by a free market. The problem
here is that it's too difficult for sellers and buyers to get in touch with
each other, because they have to be online at the same time and because only
sellers can advertise efficiently. Buyers are left to begging on the chat
channels, and often you'll have to take the deal you can get because only
one seller makes an offer.

It makes it easier to craft what you want, yes, but that doesn't necessarily
mean that it makes life of a crafter easier or more fun.

Although weaponsmiths are among those most dependent on other classes (and
at the same time a class that can produce very little other classes need),
the biggest problem about being a weaponsmith is that there isn't enough of
a market for what they produce. Making it easier to produce weapons will
only makes matters worse in this respect.
