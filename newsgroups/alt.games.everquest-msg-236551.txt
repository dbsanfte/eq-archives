Hello All;

Speaking of fishing.  I tried fishing when I first started playing EQ and
the novelty of it quickly wore off.  Vary rarely do I ever see anyone
fishing. Now in the new GoD zone in's I see tons of people fishing. It looks
funny to me to see "fancy dressed" people lined up on a river or canal bank
fishing.

My question: what quest is it and what is the reward for all this fishing?

Thanks All and have a Great Day
