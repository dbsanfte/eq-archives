If you want a definitive answer, the best way is to parse the damage done. 
From my experience I would say that if the additional haste is more than 
10% or so that it is going to equal far more damage than can be provided by 
the additional ATK buffing. To be sure what the "cut off" point is, though, 
you would need to parse several hundred fights each way against identical 
MOBs and I haven't done so.
