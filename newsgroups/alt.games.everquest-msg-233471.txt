	!!!!!!

	Clericing is NOT easy.  Stressful usually.  Tedious sometimes.
But NOT easy.  You have to pay constant atention, you have to have your
timing down perfectly and that timing varies with each group and zone,
you have to watch messages - who's poisoned?  who's diseased? - and swap
spells in and out...

	Why do you think being a cleric is easy?  The only easy part
is that it's easy to get a group :-)
