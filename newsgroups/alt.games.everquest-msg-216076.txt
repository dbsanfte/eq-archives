I don't think its possible to get 6 songs out before Cantata fades, and thats
what you'd have to do in order to keep cantata up constantly while singing amp
and 5 manas.  And amp lasts longer than 6 songs, particularly if you are singing
them so fast that cantata hasn't faded.

Here's what your twist would look like (assuming you have the herculean ability
to sing that fast)

Cantata (cantata mana)
Amp
Mana (cantata mana, amped mana)
Mana (amped mana)
Mana (amped mana)
Mana (amped mana, cantata mana)
Mana (amped mana)
Cantata (cantata mana)
Amp (although amp would be expected to run another six songs more or less)

Well thats not as bad as I thought, basically you are throwing away one mana
pulse every cycle in order to keep your cycle nice and clean, costing about
1/12th your potential mana output.  If you can't sing quite that fast then the
cost is a larger ratio, I think in my case it would be about 1/10th my
potential; on the bright side I'd only have to remember to sing cantata, amp,
then mana till cantata starts to fade, so it would also be self adjusting
insofar as how fast I can cycle thru mana songs thru the varying lag.
