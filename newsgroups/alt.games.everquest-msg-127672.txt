Yup, you start the ring and at time_index01 wave 1 spawns, time_index02
wave 2 spawns, etc. regardless of what you have/haven't killed

Exactly - your raid DPS dropped and you were overtaken by poop

Yeah.

Then you can also kill AoW. If you can do Idol unslowed smoothly, you
can do AoW comfortably too using the same strat with a little luck and
practice.

Never found the need for that, but if it works for you, go for it.

OK, I think I see your problem. You're using a static list of ???
warriors? Your good tanks do fine, but by the time it gets to the
'second string' tanks (no offence, being realistic) they don't have the
tools/skills that the primary MTs do? AE taunt is good if anyone has it,
and make sure everyone knows how to agro - dual primal doesn't cut it
for getting AoW agro I'm afraid. Depending on the gap between your
tanks, it may be beneficial to put ressed/rebuffed MTs back into the
rotation. Another major point on AoW specifically, is that he's hugely
prox agro. Tickling his balls while everyone else hovers at max range is
the key to keeping agro. If he jumps the wrong person, make damn sure
they know to flip DA or autoriposte and charge between the MT's thighs
so he can regain agro. A ping-ponging AoW means failure every time.

You do - AoW is one of the least 'forgiving' mobs when you're first
killing him - you need everything to go right, and a little luck on your
side. Any slight mistake usually results in total wipeout. Once it
starts to go bad, it goes real bad, real fast. Once you get the hang of
it, it'll become a farm and you'll wonder how you ever had problems in
the past. Once you've done him a few times and got some +hate weapons,
he'll become even easier.

Sounds like a nasty server. I hope you petitioned each time (not that
I'd petition accidental training, but this sounds deliberate and
malicious). AoW isn't a mob you 'accidentally' train.

Meaning more healing and less taunt. I've always believed the highest
level, best equipped member of a group should be the MT for maximum
efficiency.

In CT, everyone who can cast root, should have it memmed at all times,
as much for agro management as crowd control. If you get caster adds,
kill casters and root melees. If you have multiple casters, unload on
the lower level casters, and med back while the last one dies to melee.

Nope -  right through the maze and out the other side. Huge pyramid with
levels, and 3 mobs in each corner with 4? wanderers. We called it 4c (4
corners) but other servers call it different - had a named Tae up at the
top back in the day, now has the Amys.

I pulled that once while camping the maze. Luckily I was smart enough to
/loc and die, rather than bring them back to show my group what I'd
found hehe.
