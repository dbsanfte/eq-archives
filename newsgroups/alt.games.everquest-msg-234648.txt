Curious. What makes plat different than any other currency that isnt
backed by redeemable physical assets? Its a long time since I could
go to the bank of England with my pounds sterling and claim gold
for it. Now, I could trade it at its current market value for gold,
or other produce, but then I can do that with plat too via ebay,
etc.

I dont argue its not less useful, less valuable than a very widely
accepted currency like the dollar, but how is it not 'real' where
a dollar is?

Well, yes ;) So if its used to represent the relative values of real
world labour.. .then... ?

Well.... Anyone can specify which of their assets are for sale, and
to whom. And sony claim ownership of all the assets of everquest, 
virtual and otherwise.

Its more effective against an individual player wanting to play the game
for whom a banned account is significant. Its irrelevant to a money
making entity using free trial accounts to farm cash, or buying new
accounts and viewing a 50$ writeoff value per <X>$ generated as entirely
acceptable.
