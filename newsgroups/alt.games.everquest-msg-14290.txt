They could ask the person who claims to have bought the account for some
kind of proof-of-purchase, an ebay link to the auction, etc. If they can't
or won't provide some sort of evidence in their favor, Verant should err on
the side of caution and restore the account to the original owner. Now you
may say that the buyer has no incentive since he will be out of an account
either way, but I personally would do it so the scammer would be banned
also.
