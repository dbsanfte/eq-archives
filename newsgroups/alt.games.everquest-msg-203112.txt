And I probably wouldn't be able to run my XP1700 at XP3200.  You can't
beat 3200 for only $60, heh.  (I hear the 1700 has even gone up to 4000.)

We do have a special heat sink installed, though. (We avoid the loud
fans, but we do have all these fancy gold-colored devices throughout our
system.  My graphics card looks like a trombone.) I have no idea if that
is essential to the 3200 rating, though likely it is.

Gods I love that XP1700. :D  My husband mumbled that they artificially
limit the bus speed (I think it was) to 200MHz, but then mumbled something
about a razorblade fixing that fast.  Guess AMD knew it was a good card
too. :P

He handles the drilling, razors, rubberbands, and thermal goo...I only go
in for stuff that requires a screw driver.  Otherwise I'd have something
much more edifying to contribute than "F0xeR0x0rz with her b0x0rz!"  (And
that's my CPU box, not boxers, just fyi.)
