I suggested this a while ago(also sent the idea in to verant) but thought it
would be good to pose it again,just to see if its still a "liked" idea.My
idea is to have a mail system.The bard mail quest helped my point.To have a
mail system much like a in-game email system.My idea would  be to purchase a
mail bag for 1p for a 2 slot bag ,it would be a bank purchase and all mail
would be accessed there.The letter you can put into it would have a limit on
the content.Then you could later buy a 20p 4slot then a 60p 6 slot bag(The
pp is just to make that the higher level you are the more mail you can
get).But the uses for such a utility is great.A. a friend you don't see on
line so much..."how is it going?If you need any help with that quest item my
mail bag is at Rivervale under Persival 23234"
B. a more detailed guild message given to all guild members that have a mail
bags saying where when and what the next raid will kill(hopefully).
C. just saying "Hi" to an on line friend that's off line at the time.
What do you think?
