The other day my son's necro jumped off the boat in Butcher Block.  He
decided to swim down as far as he could go.  When he did that he ended up in
the air.  When he looked down, he saw rain , an when he looked up he just
saw air.  His air meter was not running, so he was definately in the air,
not the water.  He couldn't figure out how to get out of the air, so he hit
his gate spell.  Funny thing though, the gate spell dropped him from high in
the air and he died from falling.

I spose we could have petitioned, but he didn't seem worried about it (GASP!
does this mean he's maturing??) Anyway, no particular reason for posting,
just thought it was strange and kinda funny.
