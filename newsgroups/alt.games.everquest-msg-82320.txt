I use to believe this, but you get to a point where you'll actually suceed
more times making the more expensive gem and cheaper metal, and more sucess
in going up also.  Maybe in silver its not super worth it if money is really
tight (more of a short term instead of long term look), but when you get to
gold or going to plat, definitely consider to work with the gold all the way
up the chart.
You really shouldn't be going to electrum and malachite until your at least
trivial with the silver and emerald (like 17 plat).  The main reason for
this is because of the sucesses you'll have will pay you more in the long
wrong, versus using the cheaper but more failure prone electrum / malachite
combo.
