For the hell of it, here's my 2cp.  I don't like "mob" precisely *because*
it means "mobile object".  I play EQ as a roleplay game where possible, and
while I know that view is in the minority, calling animals or people "mobs"
just goes to reduce the atmosphere of the game.  It just reminds me that
they're nothing more than objects.  After all, my friend's cat isn't a
"mob", nor is the girl behind the counter at the video shop.  Yes, I KNOW
there's a difference in that the non-player-controlled critters in EQ are
controlled by simple (though still beyond me) programming routines, and my
mate's cat and the video shop assistant are real life-forms, but you know
what I mean.  I don't have much more interaction with them than I do with
your average Freeport merchant.

Similarly I don't much like "toon" (although I can't say I've heard that one
much).  Firstly, it once again erodes the role-play 'feel', and secondly, as
has already been addressed, they're not toons in any case.

Probably preferring a roleplay approach makes me one of those 'too serious'
people, but I guess I'll have to live with that!
