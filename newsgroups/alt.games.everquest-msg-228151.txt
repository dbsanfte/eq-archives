You play your character, your character does not play you. I'm sure my 
character would have cleaned me out buying himself nice upgrades if that 
was a possibility ;)

So go play the Sims if you want a game the lets you do that, or at least 
put a bazaar trader up... :)

But I said a place in the hall of fame not a trophy, you don't get 
inducted for owning a team.

If you want a trophy I'm sure someone out there will sell one to you, 
and that raises an interesting point... if you buy a trophy it doesn't 
mean anything. So why buy it. That what top end gear is ... trophys... 
if you bought it there is really no meaning to it.

Sony could live without you because the people who get pissed off 
because of people like you ... wouldn't get pissed off. It is my 
contention that if SOE legitimized buying plat they'd lose far more 
players who were disgusted that the game now had now meaning then they'd 
retain because people like you could skip playing most of it.

Not at all... just as in hockey there are leagues for everyone... but if 
you have a full time job and play in a community league on Thursdays you 
are off your rocker if you think you deserve to be inducted into the 
hall of fame... no matter how much you make per hour as a 
lawyer/doctor/ceo...
