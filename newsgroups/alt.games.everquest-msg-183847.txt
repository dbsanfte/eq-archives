I don't mean the skill it took running to the zone, I mean the skill it 
took getting the whole lot of them ensnared, rooted, re-charmed and dead. 
Zigging and zagging among a bunch of PoP mobs, one of them hasted and 
all of them pissed off at you, took serious Quake-style movement skills. 
Of course, it did not require good aim, admittedly, but I doubt I had 
survived that day if I hadn't learnt to circle-strafe long ago.
