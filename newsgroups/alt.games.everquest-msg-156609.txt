I think what would make even more sense would be to release and
ship the game boxes a week or two *before* the zones go live.

That way, everyone has a chance to track down a copy and install it.
*And* this would spread out the PoP patch downloads instead of
having everyone try to do it in the same hour.

Then on the official release date, finally make it possible to
enter the new zones.

But I guess that would make things go too smoothly...
