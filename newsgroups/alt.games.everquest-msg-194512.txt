All I know is this:

My wiz can get a group, no problem.

My cleric can get a group, no problem.

My ranger can get a group, no problem.

The only time my druid can get a group is when there's no one else available
and the folks want the full group bonus.

Druids do a little of everything, but none of it as good as someone else can
do it.  The only thing druids can do well is quad, and they get bitched at
for that.

my 2cp, fwiw.
