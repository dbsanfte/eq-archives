Sure it is, in the subject line he called it
a summon moster [sic] spell for all classes.

taken literally, this would be a pet summoning
spell useable by all 14 classes.

so, does he mean monster summoning?
(the nearest translation of summon moster
I can think of, and not everyone knows it
came with Velious, or that only mages can
use it)

or summon companion?
