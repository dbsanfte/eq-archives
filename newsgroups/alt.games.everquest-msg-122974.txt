Just a suggestion on this part.  Make sure that you are SoWed and get a map
of the area so you know exactly where the zone is when you run through the
newbie area.  There is a very nasty caster named Azzar Habib who has taken
out two of my characters on that short run.  If he hits you, you will not
have much time to get to the zone.

Good Luck
