Having a knight class as the MA allows us casters to operate at full 
efficiency, killing the mob faster, allowing the next one to be pulled 
sooner, raising the speed at which xp is gained.  With a Paladin or SK as 
MA, I Malo on incoming, slow while the mob is chain stunned, or still 
walking in slowly snared.  Then I toss a couple of DoTs on it, all 
without having to wait one moment, thus, getting maximum efficiency out 
of my DoTs.  Nuking casters can be a lot less wary about tossing their 
nukes without fear of agro.  End result, mob is dead faster, and the next 
one is pulled.  Noone goes oom, we don't stop to "recharge".

Another situation where it's damned handy is when I am the healer and 
slower in the group, did IC in PoV a couple nights ago, and I was very 
glad to have an SK as the MA, because I had to debuff and slow the mobs 
on incoming in order to be able to keep the MA alive.  Had to toss an 
immediate heal on him as well.  If a warrior had been the MA, I can 
guarantee you we would have had downtime, as I would have been waiting 
for good agro to be established before I slowed them.
