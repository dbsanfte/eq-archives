How can KEI cost ANYTHING to be cast?
It uses up no reagent's and the spell can be gotten as a drop or researched.
The reason some sheisters (sp?) are charging money for it is because:

a). People are stupid enough to pay high amounts of pp for it there by
creating an inflation of prices.
b). Some players think it's thier right to charge for it because they pay
extorsionate amounts of pp to BUY the spell.

I myself is more then willing to donate a few pp's for getting it by a non
guildie but I refuse to PAY, there is a diference.

Hmm you complain about players leaving group to get "refills" yet you want
the duration LOWERED?
Where is the logic in that? It will only make those people leave their
groups more often.
