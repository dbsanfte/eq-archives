Don't see why it's "sad" to want to keep a distance between the two. I 
haven't so much as given my email address to my guild, and it's 
certainly not because I'm uncomfortable with my identity... after all, I 
use my real name and email address here; I just think that the game is 
the game, my life is my life, and the former has already more than 
enough of an impact on the latter due to consumed hours.

On the other hand, I wouldn't have a problem having a drink with most 
people in this newsgroup, including those I've had thunderous flaming 
arguments with.
