You need to be 8 if you are a dark elf enchanter; 12 if you're any other 
race enchanter. Other pure casters would probably need to do faction 
work one place or another to finish it.

Yes, it can be done alone; it's an easy quest.

Necros *are* pure casters, and yes, they can use it. The stein itself is 
all/all; so a druid could equip it; but I can't think of any reason they 
would want to (unless they need poison resist for some reason.) Quite a 
  few druids do work up their ogre faction sufficiently (wolf form 
brings you up to at least dubious from starting level, so it's not that 
big a jump) to be able to perform the quest as a money maker though; 
it's easy but requires a lot of travel which is much easier for a druid 
than for a chanter.

Stats on stein are 10 int 5 dex 10 hp 25 disease resist, 3 charges light 
healing, and it's a light source.

As to whether your necro could do it, that would depend on his faction. 
You need to be able to go into qeynos (or surefall and al'akanon 
alternatively) and erudin  to fetch no drop quest pieces, and lay your 
hands on a kiola nut (bought off the druid girls on sister isle; but 
droppable so someone else could get one for you), and your ogre faction 
needs to be at least indifferent.
