For your main skills it is as you wrote: skill cap = level*5+5 = (level+1) *
5

For secondary skills (like weapons for a pure caster) it is sometimes
another modifier than 5. I have seen 4 for piercing with my chanter for
instance.

Some skills have hard caps for different levels, like 149 for kick with
warriors (can anyone confirm please?). 200 on most skills until level 50,
etc.

Trade skills have no cap.
