While it's impossible to prove a negative, and this isn't much of a
sample, I killed a couple of those widows while waiting for a Hole raid
to start recently.  And yes, they only dropped the woven silk for the
newbie armor. If they do, in fact, drop regular spider silk, (which is
entirely possible) I haven't seen it.

I tend to think not, though. They seem to be part of the "revamp
generation" of mobs that were added in for the newbie armors. They tend
to have their own loot table. Another example is the giant yellow
recluse in Steamfont. Drops quest specific yellow recluse silk (also for
newbie armor quests) and no regular silk. I've killed a metric buttload
of those and never seen a single normal silk drop.
