I am at 149 skill and make them and there is indeed a market but if
you arent willing to spend a lot of time in EC like I do (Level 30
Warrior with 109+ days played=>) you will most likely miss the
calling.

On Morell Thule when I was younger and really wanted to get a Birthday
Cake for my sweetie of the time I saw someone auctioning them and
asked how much.  The response was "100pp, or 50pp if you provide your
own chocolate."

Personally I thought that was insane, even knowing how difficult it
was to obtain brownie parts so when I was able to make them I cut the
price in half and wasnt seeing much action at all.  A few inquiries
here and there but mostly they were put off by the price.  So I
dropped it to 25pp, sliced or unsliced and started getting bites.

I had one sale that was 300pp.  A few that were around 100 and many 25
to 50pp sales.  Many people will indeed celebrate thier personal
birthdays for 25pp=)  For those who are celebrating thier own birthday
I will usually give them one that is sliced and one that is whole
along with some Brandy or the like and eat the whole cake with them
and have a few drinks.

For Weddings I usually get a handle on how many people will be
attending and then work out something and it includes the Bride and
the Groom getting a whole cake for free for each of them, sort of my
wedding gift=)

Just my 2c=)
