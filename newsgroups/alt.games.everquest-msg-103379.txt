I have not played with enough of them to make a comment in that regard,
however, there is at least one exception I ran into last night.  I am one
drop away from getting my Shield of Bane Warding, I need to loot an Amulet
of the Burning Priest in Scarlet Desert.  I went to SD last night did a camp
check, a Barbarian warrior answered he was camping the priest.  I sent him a
tell asking if he was after the Amulet, he said yes. We talked a bit about
it, I mentioned it was the last drop I needed.  He offered to give me the
camp, as he still had some other drops to go after.  I eventually accepted,
after talking with him some more.  I arrived on the Plataeu, the rest of the
group that was going to help me had not yet arrived, so he invited me to
join his group, and helped with killing the PHs and other mobs in the area
while I waited on the rest of my group.  When the rest of my group arrived,
he gathered up his group, and headed out to get some of the other drops.  I
wish I could say that it ended well, and I got my amulet, however, no such
luck this time.  It was a real pleasure to run into someone that is that
nice and helpful in the game.  He is not the first such person, and I'm sure
not the last, that I will run in to.  Needless to say, he, and the guild he
is in, are on my list of people who will always get any assistance I can
reasonably offer.
