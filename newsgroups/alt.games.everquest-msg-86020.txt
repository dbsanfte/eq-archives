It really looks as though Ebay is coming down hard on anyone trying to sell
accounts, PP, items etc. there. Almost EVERY single auction concerning one
of those things has been deleted.
Just being curious, is this sort of transactions being taken somewhere else
now? Or have people given up on that type of selling? ("Selling the time it
took me to...")
