If I cast aego on them, and then they handed me a peridot, then yes, that would
make sense.  But these are people I don't know who are coming to me, hat in
hand, to ask a favor.  One that costs me a substantial amount of "sitting on my
buttocks" time, mind you.  In the case of the lowbies, a very substantial
amount.  Only they don't do it "hat in hand" they come over like its their god
given right, and like the only reason in the world I wouldn't do it is the chump
change a peridot represents.

Group mate asks for Aego, I give it no questions asked.  Guild mate, same
thing.  Friend, no problem.  Stranger on the street, though?  Here's a peridot
Mr. Aego Vending Machine, chop chop and make sure you put that amulet of insight
on I see poking out of your backpack first?  Ask nice, ask polite, but wait, now
you are just begging and I don't want to feed that either.  So offer to pay,
offer a real amount of money, or don't ask at all.

Its not the money, mind you.  I'll never get rich doing aego at 100pp a pop.
Its the message: I understand that this uses up your time and energy, and is
something that is valuable to me.

People offer to pay for a rez, which cost me far less mana back when it cost
mana at all... why do they think, nay assume, that Aego should be free?
