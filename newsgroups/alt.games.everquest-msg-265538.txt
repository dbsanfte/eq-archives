  Actually, he's responding to Mary Poppins here.  I was never in the
original beta.  Mary Poppins thinks there will never be a server merge, I
on the other hand do.

   And it is populated by people who either knew it would be a low
population server, or figured that out real quick and decided to stay
anyways.  People from more populated servers, that is, pretty much all of
them except for the zeks and possibly FV, will start to notice the drop in
population and become demoralized, I believe.

    Well, since he is responding to MP my quit time isn't as critical. 
But, just for the record, when I played on Test I had all the available
expansion, including LDoN and LoY.  And I quit after GoD, but before OOW.  

   I agree with MP that some servers can, and do, exist just fine with a
low population.  I just don't think that everyone on every server will be
happy playing in that kind of an environment.  I think that the crisis will
come when more and more people are finding it harder to reach the raid
required content because guild populations have shrunk (or even fallen
completely apart).

   Funny thing about this thread.  I don't recall seeing anyone argue
against the proposition that there will be a somewhat drastic, game wide
reduction in player population sometime in the near future (within a year
or two).  There's a fair amount of disagreement about how SOE will deal
with this in regards to server numbers, but no dissension on the original
assumption.
