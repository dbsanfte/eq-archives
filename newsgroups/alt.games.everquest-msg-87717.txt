At level 1 our guild had a race.  We all created level 1 *PVP* gnomes (so no
buffs or ports possible, realistically speaking) and raced from Ak'Anon to
Erudin.

While most of us died at least once (hard not to with 30-40hp) the winners
(a couple) made it in 1:15 hours.

Now tell me again how exploration is heavily limited. :)
