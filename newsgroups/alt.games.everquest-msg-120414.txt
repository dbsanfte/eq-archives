Um, pardon... How are Clerics Way too powerful?  They cant solo? their
only task in life is to Heal and Rez.. oh and some great HP AC
buffs....   so where do we become way too powerful?
Druids are still screwed.... Please elaborate
You get port?, Sow? Damage Shield? Snare? evac? buffs? very useful
heals no matter what you think?  oh that's right .. you don't get to
REZ and Complete Heal...     yep your screwed again...
