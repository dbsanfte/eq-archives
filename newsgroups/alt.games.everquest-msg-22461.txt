A very common outlook now.

Expect somewhat of an exodus once DAoC comes out. People will then
come back for Luclin if DAoC is not up to snuff (some will anyways).

Its not a matter of DAoC being better (though imo it will be in quite
a few, though not all, ways), its just a matter of nothing being new
to the high level EQ player. DAoC, on the other hand, will be
completely new.

The same would have been said for AO if it wasn't a buggy laggy PoS,
and Shadowbane if it was more than "l33t dewdz here plz".
