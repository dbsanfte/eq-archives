If you are looking to make -instant- cash then I would recommend
leveling/looting.  Once you hit 29, whammo, the druids most usefulness
trade.  (no flaming on that one, I've got a 55 druid and at times it appears
this way) ;p

If you aren't looking to make -instant- cash, then I would suggest in this
order:

- Foraging (get that skill up, you're gonna need it for your "hardened
mixture", which is part of your EPIC anyway)

- Brewing (with the berries, vegatables, etc that you foraged)

- Tailoring (easy enough to get pelts, snare fear animal, kill, loot pelt,
make something)

Everyone has a preference, but, these are the steps that I had taken.  Then
again when I created my druid I had already had a "main" character and could
afford to do just about anything I wanted.  This may or may not apply to
you.  I'm assuming it doesn't though. :)
