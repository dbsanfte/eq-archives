dwarf rogue would have better phsical stats than a gnome, and a better home
city loc. I wasnt even aware that gnomes could be rogues... oh well.
Also, once u get guise (mask?) of the deciever, u can have dark elf form,
and enter evil cities. just a matter of going down to lguk and hanging
around the spawn. Most people camp him for some other item (banded belt?)
and they wont mind u looting it, so its effectively free for rogues. (and
bards)

If youre new to EQ, i recommend a druid (yes another one), as its an easy
class, with a smattering of all sorts of magic so you can learn the game.
Also you get teleport at level 19, and can learn the geography safely (with
sow). You'll have a more informed choice then, ans the druid is great for
earning some money for twinking the new char, if youre into that.
