I was under the impression this game was going gold / live in mid-October.
They just added a new class or line of spells that define a class?

-If- the above is true, that's just crazy.  There's no way to get out bugs
and get -in- balance in that short time.

I've been waiting for NwN since it was first mentioned publicly, and it
doesn't bother me a bit that they keep pushing it back, as long as they are
doing their best to make it as flawless as possible.  I -much- prefer
quality over a quick release date.
