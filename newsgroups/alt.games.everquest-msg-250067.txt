Hi don't blame the "ubers", thanks.

As somebody in a very high end guild.. I can tell you this, I saw the list
and thought it was a joke too.  Not that I thought it was a hoax, just.. the
list is so fucking stupid, its beyond belief.

Its toys, minor things, stuff that makes you think "ok cool.. but who really
gives a fuck?"

What a farce.

The only question is.. was anybody really surprised?
