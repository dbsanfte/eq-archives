If I ever won a huge lottery (which will be hard, since I almost never
play), I would set up trust funds for a handful of friends, with the funds
designed to generate enough income for the friends that they can live very
well without ever working again.

The idea is that it would suck if I wanted to do something with my friends,
and they had to say "no" because they had to go to work.
