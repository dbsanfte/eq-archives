 Nope they know nothing DT thought that would have been obvious by
now. Sony would never take action that could cost them serious money
without some sort of possible gain. Going after Yantis is lose lose,
first thay could lose the case THEN suffer a counter suit that Yantis
would almost certainly win, second they shut Yantis down at great
cost. And no I have no benifit from yantis I just hate morons.
