Thats the interesting point here, if you look at James' message.

From the details mentioned, the guy wasn't suing Sony at all.   Just the
person who hacked him.   If the story is correct as stated, Sony would not
have ended up in court.   They took steps to avoid a judgment against
someone else.

And it does make sense, in a way (1).   Any judgment found against the
perpetrator would have to value the damages done.  Which would be setting
precedent for an account having a monetary value.

While this wouldn't really effect the selling accounts argument, it could
enter into a lot of other possible suits. Like for instance a server crash
losing an account.   If the person wanted to sue Sony for the loss of the
value of his account...  any previous decision that did assign a value to
the account would be a point against Sony.  Or even a stupider possible
lawsuit..  Sony makes a change or a nerf that arguably reduces the value of
the account.   Someone sues to recover the loss in value. (2)



(1)  - Standard disclaimer, IANAL.

(I Am Not A Lawyer)

(2) - Yes, it's a stupid example that would likely have no chance in court.
But it still costs big money to defend against lawsuits, even stupid
frivolous ones.
