Is there a way to disable this? I think it is used for the windowing 
features, but I already use EQW and thus do not need it. I use the 
keypad Enter key to jump, since I use the keypad to move (I'm a lefty), 
and I often am using Alt while running around as I move the camera 
around. This can result in a quick (one second or less) flashing black 
of the screen as it tries to do whatever Alt-Enter was designed to do in 
the game. I didn't see anything about it in the Options, is there a way 
to diasble it?
