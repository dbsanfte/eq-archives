On this same line of thought... in the Nexus there is a dwarf at the
end of one of the paths that is digging his brother I belive out from
a cave in... there is a Elf or Human (cant rember) with him who says
to leave him alone, that there are workers on the otherside in Pauld
Caverns digging there way through....   
I wonder when they will open up that pathway?...

just a little side note..
