Well I think you've answered your own question. 2 unstacked silk swatches 
and a pattern would take up 3 slots, so you're right - you can't make them 
in a small sewing kit. That is why people buy large sewing kits. Some 
higher end items use even more than 8 slots (wu tunics etc), and you can't 
even use a large sewing kit. If you can't afford a large kit, or need 10 
slots for some reason, there are looms in most towns - click on the top of 
the wooden frame to open (note that only the ones with the white cloth in 
them seem to act as sewing kits - the tartan ones are just scenery).
