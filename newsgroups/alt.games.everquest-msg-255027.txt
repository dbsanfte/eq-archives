I am just stating my observations from over 500 LDoN adventures
across 16 toons on 4 servers. My characters have been Killed by
these traps all too often; and usually the person who gets the
whole party killed does a /q very fast.

Rudely Arrogant would be the asshats like you who decided they
could risk my xp (and every elses in the party) to MAYBE get some
piece of trash worth 5cp; when you could have simply played nice
and let us exit the dungeon. What I choose to risk my xp on is my
decision, NOT yours or anyone elses.
