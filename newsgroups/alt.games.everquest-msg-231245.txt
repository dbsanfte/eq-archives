Bah - he's made me miss my Game Developer subscription.  I used to love
those post-mortems.  I wonder what else they would talk about with EQ?

Gameplay design decisions (stuff that led to kiting, camping and the like)?

What was the network code like to write/debug?

I remember they were criticized for requiring 3d hardware - a move which
I think payed off for them - what were the internal discussions on that
like?
