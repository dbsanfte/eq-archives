i've been playing eq at home for about two years. i finally
got a new PC at work with a 3D card, so i thought i'd see how
eq looks on a nice fast machine (mine at home is kinda slow.)

when i try to run, i get this error:

  Connection lost.
  EverQuest file update failed.  If the problem persists, contact your
  network administrator or internet service provider for assistance.
  [patch.everquest.com:7000TCP]

  * ERROR *: A request to send or receive data was disallowed because
  the socket is not connected and (when sending on a datagram socket
  using a sendto call) no address was supplied.

  If this is your first time playing EverQuest, refer to
  "Troubleshooting Your Connection" in "EverQuest_Manual.txt" in your 
  EverQuest folder.

however, there is NO mention of "Troubleshooting Your Connection"
in EverQuest_Manual.txt!  i'm pretty sure the problem is with the
firewall at work, but i don't know where to begin trying to solve
the problem...
