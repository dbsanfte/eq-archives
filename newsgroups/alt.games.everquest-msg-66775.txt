I would have reimbursed the difference, but not giving him all of his money
back.  If he threatened you, tell him go ahead because your guild obviously
knows you not to be a thief and I think the GM would have asked you what
happened and you could explain your side and they would have seen it was a
simple mistake.   I dont think your a thief due to the way you wrote your
message.  Mistakes happen.  He should have checked himself and contacted you
right away to let you know that it wasn't what he had wanted.  If it ever
happens again and they threaten you, reimburse the difference and tell them
to piss off.  I am sorry for your loss.  Good luck.
