I don't think I'm understanding your question correctly...  

The only time you need to input an account key is the very first time you load
the new expansion, you would use the key that comes on the CD.  If you download
an expansion, no key is needed.

After that, anytime you install/reinstall EQ on any computer, as soon as you
put in your Station Name and Password, your previous registered expansions are
automatically approved.  

If you bought a new expansion in the store, and you input the key and it says
it has been previously used, then that is an issue to take up with Sony and the
store you purchased the expansion from.
