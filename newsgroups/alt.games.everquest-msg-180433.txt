    As a programmer I feel qualified to tell you that the only "adequate"
test is running the program in the real world (in this case installing it on
all the servers) and letting the shit hit the fan. Eventually all the bugs
get ironed out. You can test things 40 flavours of backwards in the lab and
find nothing, and as soon as it hits the real world and real users, kaboom,
problematica maximus.

    Which is why the test server is there in the first place, but the
biggest baddest bug we've had recently from EQ was caused by insufficient
population on the test server.... And can the test server ever be as big as
a regular server? Or have the same uptimes? Maybe, and probably not...

    Almost all computer games are full of bugs, some of them could have been
fixed by a tiny bit of testing in the lab, others can only be discovered by
playing the game to death and back. The really awesome thing about EQ and
bugs is that the developers are constantly fixing them... constantly
applying patches in a relatively convenient fashion.

    EQ probably only seems majorly buggy to most people because the bugs and
fixes are made very public - not hidden in some version.txt in an obscure
folder but brought to EVERY user's attention after every patch. I've played
up to 49 and can say I can't recall being seriously inconvenienced by a bug
yet, except the delays in patching them (they tend patch at 10pm my time at
the moment :P).

    That score is staggering considering the amount of new content that goes
into the game every few months... If you dont want to suffer from bugs, do
what I'll do and leave the new expansion well alone for 3-6 months ;)
