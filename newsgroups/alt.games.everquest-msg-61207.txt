Well lets see, I played Halflife TFC for 14 months straight. Hours and
hours of it. So for me I think it's last a while.  In 6 months if the
game is still the same as it is now then there's a problem.  I fully
expect however there will be realm rewards, a ranking system, more
rewards and penalties for lost forts, more PvE content, many more
spells, etc.
