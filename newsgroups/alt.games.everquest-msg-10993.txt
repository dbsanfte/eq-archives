I think the original poster said that the pieces would cost a maximum of
15pp per attempt.. worst case around 5pp/AC for the lesser items (using very
round numbers). So, 8-10pp per AC is quite a bit over cost. One poster on
eqtraders.com said he/she would likely price the armor at 5pp/AC going by
the ingredients cost. I could see 300pp per suit, but 600pp seems like quite
a lot. Isn't plate armor sold for 10pp/AC?  Some of the pieces, the boots in
particular, might be worth more because they're better than what's out
there.

Anyhow, I'm glad the tailors out there will have something to "bridge the
gap" to the higher Velious tailoring recipes! :-)
