    I should have modified the header - she's a blue server Necro, not on
Sullon. I was just talking about not having enough cash after having gained
levels in Paineel. Perhaps the other 60 necromancers cherry-picked the
newbie garden, although given that at least one three-spawn of skels is
instant repop I can't see that happening TOO badly....

    I don't care if Laverne never leaves Odus. I've still only scratched the
surface of The Warrens (just started regular clearing of the Pit Fighters,
Foodmaster/Smithy, and Trainer), I have yet to attempt Kerra Ridge, and
Stonebrunt is coming out soon. Nothing says "evil" like fear-kiting panda
bears. And considering how many times I've done the Molar quest, and killed
that named Erudite prisoner, I imagine half of Erudin would zone to come get
me anyways.....
