}i want a mana pres 4 item

Here are your choices:
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemswitheffect.html?id=3537

}i can't find one for sale or one purchasable with ldon points
}i'm assuming i can't buy one? or droppable ones are too rare?

Droppable:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19058

Most of the items are from the ornate crafted armor for your class, 
generally sleeves for int casters, boots otherwise.

}i'm also assuming it'd be more common to find an item that works as mana
}pres on certain types of spells, rather than on all of them?

There are four -basic- lines of those, Enhancement Efficiency (works on 
buffs), Affliction Efficiency (works on dots), Summoning Efficiency (works 
on pets), and Reanimation Efficiency (works on necro/sk pets).  Each line 
has a comparable number of items, but some of these are easier to get than 
the overall mana preservation items.  These also provide a greater savings 
in mana than the 10% of mana pres., within their paricular spell line.  So 
if you're a buff class, pet class, or dot class, it may be worth having 
both one of these and an MP item.
