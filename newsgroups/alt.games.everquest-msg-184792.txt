I don't have the video game, but I've found a way around the Sense Heading
thing.  Bought a compass.  Right click on the compass and it gives reliable
headings.  I keep it in my "essentials" pack.  Not sure how common these
compasses are.  I bought the only one I've ever seen on Luclin.  I still
keep my SH practiced up, because the compass is somewhat inconvenient when
you are running for your life.  Need a secret decoder ring version. ;-)

Cheers,
Eric
