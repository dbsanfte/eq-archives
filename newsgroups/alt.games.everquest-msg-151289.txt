That's half your problem - every single incident of harrassment is worth
petitioning. Assholes like this run on hate - never ever bite to any of his
crap, just silently report it all. It's just a matter of time before his own
stupidity hangs himself.

But having said that, if you don't act then your wasting everyones time. The
CS guys have to move slowly and surely to ensure they themselves aren't a
favoured tool used by the griefers, but if they don't even *know* it's going
on you can hardly blame them for lack of action....
