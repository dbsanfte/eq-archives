Commodities (vendor sold items/food/spells/armour/etc) should be 
droppable)

Another variation... perhaps just 'equipable' items should be all no-
dropped (with the exception of summoned items)??

I'm concerned with the impact of 70th level GM tradeskillers transfering 
in though.

No x-fers is probably the better way to go.

Maybe it could be opened up to character transfers once the native 
population started to reach 65.

Ideally:
I think drop rates would need to be generally increased a bit.

or otherwise, at the very least:

I'd think I'd like to see no drop gear be moveable through the shared 
bank slot. For mule purposes, for 

Maybe have no xfrs but have new characters start at 30th or 45th or 
somehting if you have a high level character on another server??? The 
other responses seem to be repeating the theme that people just don't 
want to play the low end game longer then they absolutely have to.
