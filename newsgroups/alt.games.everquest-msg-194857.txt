I last played on FV six months ago so can't comfortably make
any recommendations nowadays, but: any answer would have to 
depend on your character's race/class. A lot, though not all, 
of FV guilds are roleplaying in nature.

Unless by "good guild" you meant "good-aligned" instead of 
"high quality". :)

Anyway, you might find some info on the Firiona Vie ezboard,
http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie, in the Guilds & Associations 
forum.

>Also does anyone know what the top end guild are / are like ?

The highest end raiding guilds are Resolution and Fire & Fury. 
They both require new members to be 60-ish (varies by class). 
Neither of those have any RP-based restrictions.
