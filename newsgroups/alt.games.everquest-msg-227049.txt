I think in 56 levels [have temporarily stalled in levelling a couple of 
times on purpose] i have probably lost people about 75-80 times. that is 
my group, or my group in a raid, not counting anybody elses groups in a 
raid situation...

hm, in 7 levels in dreadlands, i hunted about 7 hours a day always 
grouped and IIRC i lost very few group members. 1 entire group wipe to 
that nasty monk, and 7 miscellaneous deaths - mostly the puller getting 
rooted to far for us to rescue him/her. only 1 robewearer from a bad 
pull agro situation. more than a few times i sweated out a bad pull with 
low mana or with hoping my healing spells would cook off in time. In 
that time i did 8 or 9 raids, and in the raids i lost 3 people in my 
group, and was part of 1 raid wipeout, and 1 failed ringwar of 4 played 
in - nobody in my group died in any of my ringwars.

I will admit to a certain visceral enjoyment of the tension of hoping 
that the spell will cook off in time, or that i wont get OOM on that 
multiple add...and i will admit to a couple of my own deaths because i 
chose to finish casting a CH rather than ducking out of it because i 
know that keeping the Mt alive long enough to protect the druid evacing 
people and that the rogue in the corner hiding will drag my corpse out 
and a 96% rez fixes just about everything=) *binding right outside a 
dungeon is good*
aru
i dont mind if i die in the course of a good fight, but i HATE dying 
because someone is an idiot and trains on me, or i get trained on 
deliberately.
