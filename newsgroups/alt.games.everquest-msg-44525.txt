Farm the Giants in the Frontier Mountains.  First it's important to get
some spirit pouches from a shaman so you can carry a good amount of stuff,
then start killing.  The Giant Grub Diggers (pickaxes) sell to vendors for
30pp or so, Giant Lord's Tunics for 50pp.  Many of the other drops, gems
included are often 10+pp.  Another benefit is the slight chance of getting
a Forrest Loop.  It's boring, you won't get much xp and you might piss off
a few people, but you can make 100-200pp per 3 hour session, maybe more if
you're lucky.
