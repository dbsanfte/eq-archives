You obvoiusly have a somewhat selective memory regarding the humble beginnings 
of EQ. When I started playing, 3 months after official release (!), Voodoo2 
users (at that time a valid 3D card choice) had to use a particular driver 
(NOT the newest one) to have it run without crashing all the time. Even if you 
used this driver EQ crashed everytime you switched resolutions. There were 
numerous sound related crashes, and the suggested fix was turning down the 
realism, or turning it off alltogether. Regarding features, it took Verant 
more than a year to implement such a simple thing as gamma control for the D3D 
users.

Yes, the client crashes often (about every 30 min for me). Yes, the lag is 
often unacceptable. But they claim the servers run in debug mode and that this 
causes most of the more serious problems. Let's hope they're correct. But AO 
is NOT unplayable. In fact I think it's fun, even in its current state.

EQ's quests in the beginning fell in three catagories: 1) Not working at all 
(a huge part of them); 2) Boring and not worth the effort (the biggest slice); 
and 3) Just boring. Yes, today there indeed ARE interesting quests in EQ, but 
there was not very much content at the start. AO has only very few quests 
right now, and quite a few of those don't work (this may also be related to 
lag), but at least the remaining ones are worth your time. Add to this, that 
AO's dynamic quest system is principally far superior to EQ's static system, 
and I think AO will beat EQ easily in the quest catagory.

>        Trade skills? Nope.

Didn't try, they are not working at all right now ? That's indeed bad, they 
should be beta tested before release. However, don't get me started on trade 
skills in EQ. They are just making them worthwhile now, years and two 
expansions after release ...

>        Vehicles? Nope.

Oh well, this seems to be a minor concern... I can wait a few months for 
those.

No online game with subscription fee will ever ship complete. That would be 
just stupid, considering the format. Yes, it should be playable and it should 
be fun the day it hits the street and I think AO will meet these req's on the 
26th. But one of the best things about this kind of games is that there is 
money for further developments for months or even years after release. Look at 
EQ's first release version and look where it is now. And AO has so much more 
potential !
