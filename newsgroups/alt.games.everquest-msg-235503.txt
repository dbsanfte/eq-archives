Can't find anything semi-legit to bitch at today DT?  You pathetic
clueless pos.  It's pretty sad when a bit of mild sarcasm can get
you so worked up.  Or perhaps you'd like to cite past instances
where I complained about SOE being a for-profit organization?  Oh
wait, you can't.  Not only that, but if you actually bothered to
fire off a second or third neuron today you might recall instances
where I flamed morons for whining about it.  And yet, you, in your
infinite lack of wisdom, project your pet bugaboo onto my post.  You
have turned yourself into the saddest excuse for a "flamer" this NG
has ever seen, you are so utterly predictable that I could program a
fucking mindless robot to emulate you and nobody here would notice
the difference.  Get a fuckling clue asshat.

Listen up Mr. IgnorantlyJudgementalSelfabuser, Stromm was tremendous fun
for months, more fun than the prior 2-1/2 _years_ of EQ taken together.
Of course, a stupid ignorant fuck like you, apparently believing that
imagining others's to be as pathetic as yourself makes you a creative
genius, wouldn't ever be in a position to learn that though, would you?

You really are having difficulties today, aren't you junior?  Please,
oh sad pathetic thrashing wannabe, cite for me the dictionary where
hope is a synonym for assume.  After failing at that, go take a course
on reading comprehension before you make a fool of yourself again.
