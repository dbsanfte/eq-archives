What are the new prayer and portal spells on the Test Server for?  Are
they just playing around or are they part of the caster rebalancing
project? 

The 'Portal' spells are another project and won't be castable by
players. 

The 'Prayer' spells are associated with some new trade skill work
we're doing.   I've just added over a thousand recipes to various
tradeskills, and expect to see those go live in a couple weeks.  These
new recipes expand on various cultural tradeskills, fill in some gaps
in tradeskill progression, and raise the bar significantly for
grandmaster tradesfolk.  Many of the new recipes create items of a
much higher quality than previously available, and I expect they'll be
in high demand.    

In addition to the recipes I added, Yakatizma has plans to smooth out
the skill gain progression and make some adjustments to the trivial
levels of many older recipes. 


bout time they made the skills updated and more worth while.
