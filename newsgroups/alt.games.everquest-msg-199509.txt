Preface: I am topposting here, to make a point before you read my
comments. I am breaking a rule of mine, don't encourage idiots.

I usually ignore this guy, but I dont want him to suck out the fun
from an aspiring wizzy. I think he is a class A idiot with something
stuck in his craw. I think that something is MANABURN.

"The Uber Nuker" <***> whines like a little girl in message
news:<bailtr$478$1@news.dataguard.no>...

Wrong, 29. Unless you define for real some other way that actually
quadding. Succulents in OT are good to quad until you get to 35.

Is a nice ring.

WAAAAH WAAAAH

At least he had something right...

Sure, play a halfing druid if you have no imagination, and want to get
a small edge on the game.

Better advice, try all kinds of classes and play what you like the
best. A class and race you like, will get you farther, because you
will actually ENJOY the game MORE. Maximizing and minimizing may get
you levels, but playing what you like gets you entertainment. Tell it
to my Human Mage. Use the limitations to make the game fun!

I contest that. I think its a blast...

Think what? Are you saying the CEO of Sony is holding a meeting about
nerfing wizards again? Maybe he is holding a Six Sigma project on
Nerfing wizards. Perhaps the Stockholder report says, "We will nerf
wizards another 20% to increase revenues...."

Maybe an Uber whiner.
