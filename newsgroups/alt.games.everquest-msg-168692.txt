And rogues can simply 'vanish' with escape and SOS. Bear in mind
my perspective is from the high end game, but also bear in mind
that at lower levels 'root and run' as an example hasnt a huge
success rate; roots dont last long, and rangers dont have many HP's.

Additionally, it is not uncommon for rogues to simply 'hide' by
default, and reveal only once a pull has been shown to be a sensible
size. I cant count the number of times idiot pull has wiped a party
only for the rogue to be left chuckling saying 'well, better consent
me'.

Its simply *not* very very slow once you level up some.

They do very large amounts of damage with very little downside.
Compare them to, say, a warrior. Quite simply, rogues rock. And
they can solo just fine, although I will agree they do far better
grouped - that said, this is a grouping game, no?

Well, it depends how you define 'overpowered'. If you take 'desiribility
to a high level guild' as a good metric both shamans and rogues are
waaaay up near the top of the list as important classes.

Well. Perhaps. I'm not kidding. Druids really are EQ on easy mode.
They're not great raiding, but they frankly dont suck either.

I think the class I feel sorriest for at the moment is the warrior,
just because of their godawful taunt ability. For a class whose
saving grace is meant to be being the supreme tank requiring serious
items to have any hope of holding aggro fast is just sad. In POP
XP groups I regularly see hybrids being asked to tank in place of
equal level warriors just to save the clerics mana spot healing the
debuffers as stuff comes in.
