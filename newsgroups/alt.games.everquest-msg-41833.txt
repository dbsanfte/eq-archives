you are under the damage cap.  After level 20 you will do more damage.  Not sure
of how twinked/cash situation you have.  People have trouble giving away harpoon
of the depths any more, Slime coated harpoons are relatively cheaper now (600pp
or so) Bladed Thulian Claws are a horrible weapon choice for a rogue after level
10 due to backstab.  You should be using a piercing weapon in your main hand. 
10 to 12 damage per hit is not that bad, but it depends on the delay of the
weapon.  the lower the delay the more damage over time you will do.
