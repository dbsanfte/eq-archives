It is in terms of goals, especially if you're not interested in
raiding.   There's only so many times you can go back
and kill the same mobs before it's boring.   Once you
hit 50 doing the heritage quests doesn't take long (except
for the high-level ones, of course.)

Lots of people will be more than ready for an increase in
the level cap by then IMO.

You'll be able to bypass it until you're 50, of course.  But I
highly doubt the tiering system ignores it.    They can add
three T6 zones and six T6 dungeons and have 'leftover'
zones to add to T3, T4, and T5 (and new T1/T2 zones
don't make sense until/unless they add a starting player
city) to hit their dozen 'target.'    There's little reason to add
an expansion that's entirely targeted at the high-end IMO.
