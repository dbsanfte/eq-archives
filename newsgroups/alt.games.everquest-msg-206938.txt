Generally, if it gives you an ability your character doesn't otherwise have,
it's an exploit.  If you find a place to stand where you can hit mobs
without being hit back - you're exploiting.  Doesn't matter if it's caused
by a geometry bug or not.  In this case, if his zoning is allowing him to
heal himself from 5% to 70% without using any mana, it's an exploit.
