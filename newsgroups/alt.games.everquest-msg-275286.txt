You can make the subcomponants but it uses more fuel than the class
that specializes in them. What it does do is put an upper limit on
what is charged because if you charge too much someone can make them
themselves. It also makes it so even if you can't get the
subcomponants because you can't find another crafter or the other
crafters are busy you can make them yourself if necessary and continue
to level. I don't see it as peoples first choice for subcomponants.
