As a newbie, i was handed stuff that i had no idea how valuable it was;
sometimes i'd ask someone else if it was any good, and they'd say, no, throw
it away... i wasn't until ages later that i realised that they were
incredibly twinked and jaded and couldn't remember the day they didn't want
to throw away copper coins..

I remember being insulted because i was wearing patch armour by a level 3
woman in full plate. Now at least i have a character that can make his own
banded and is working on chain, and is not sure whether to go down smithing
or tailoring past level 200, and if my gear doesn't suit you, fine, i'm not
asking you to wear it ;-)
