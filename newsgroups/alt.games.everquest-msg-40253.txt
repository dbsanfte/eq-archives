>Hmm.. well 90% of the people I talk to in the game disagree with you. 

Then why do "this game is boring me to tears" posts appear in the beta
forums on almost a daily basis?

>And
>compared to EQ and AC and UO.. hmmm, well their IS no comparison.

See how people feel about the game 2 years after release, then come back.

Or, for the UO comparison, see how people like it after 4 years. If it is
still around then.

>In the last two weeks that I have played the beta, I have had ONE crash -
>how many other games can say that - even long established games?

I'd rather have an interesting game that crashes sometimes than a 100%
stable, but put-me-sleep boring one. DAoC has the stability down pat (at
least, for now...lord only knows what will happen in release), but that is
not enough to make me buy it.
