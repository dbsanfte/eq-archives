A 57 has to kill a LOT of level 38 mobs to level;  a 39
doesn't.  So, yes, logically your XP bar should move
pretty well and hers very little.  After all, you're
duoing high blues, almost even cons.  She's duoing very
low blues, almost green.

All they've done is change the person with the motivation
for grouping.   Before, a lower-level grouped with a
higher-level player (or group) wouldn't get much XP and,
other than loot and the (non-leveling type of) experience,
didn't have a whole lot of reason for being there.  The
higher-level player(s) had the motivation.

Now, a higher-level player grouped with a lower-level
player (or group) won't get much XP and, other than
the loot and the (non-leveling type of) experience,
doesn't have a whole lot of reason for being there.  The
lower-level player(s) now have the motivation.

And, purely from the motive point-of-view, a higher-level
player is going to group with a player at the lower-end of
the group spectrum for a couple of reasons:  he's either
power-leveling a friend or going after loot where he doesn't
need a "real" group but can't (or doesn't want to) solo.
It's in everyone's interest to take a 52 cleric with a lower
level group to go get the early epic pieces now;  before the
lower-level group had little reason to want to go:  the cleric
would take almost all of the XP.

And, of course, if he's power-leveling, he doesn't want to
that to take forever.  For all the "purists" who scream about
twinks or power-leveling, the game mechanics sure make it
easy and recent changes are making it even easier.  I doubt
that's unintentional.

Yeah, the fastest way to power-level a whole group is to
throw a level 60 monk into a group in a dungeon where the
mobs are going to be low-blue at best.  A 60 monk, assuming
decent equipment, can fly through 40ish mobs with even a
druid healing and, of course, has all the pulling advantages
inherent in both a 60 monk and a level 60 anything.  Imagine
a 60 monk grouped with a 40 warrior/enchanter/cleric/wizard
and rogue at the entrance to the Hole, for instance.  Of
course they'd run out of mobs too fast but the XP would
still *fly* past...

I'm under the impression that bards don't stack well, at
least not in that way.  (A couple in a group can complement
each other, of course, but I don't know if more than two
is worthwhile...)   I don't know much about bards, though,
other than I like having one around.  (Except for crowd
control;  any place where I've *needed* crowd control the
bard was always overwhelmed sooner than an enchanter
would be.)
