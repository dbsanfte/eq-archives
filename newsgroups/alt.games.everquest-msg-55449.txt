As it is with a majority of the things that players want changed. The vocal
minority is usually what gets things done. There will always be a vocal
minority because one thing about human nature is they take the easiest path.
One of conformity. If they have no totally negative or totally positive
feeling on the subject then they will not spend the time to pursue it.
Just because a vocal minorities pleas will not directly affect you then why
should you care? You would still be able to inspect when you like "if" a
player wants you to that is. Give and take both sides having a choice and
not just one.
