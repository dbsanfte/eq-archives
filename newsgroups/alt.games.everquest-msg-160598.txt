I try not to do more than one client at a time when I'm doing ports so I 
don't have anybody stranded in an expansion they don't have.  At the 
very least, if I have one person wanting to go to Lava and one wanting 
to go to Luclin and they both must be there NOW!!!, I go to Lava first 
and drop off there and then go to Luclin.
