I didn't see anything in the petition stating that having a sub-par
system and the expansion putting the game out of reach was the reason
for it. The method of the complaint is futility personified, I agree
100% with you there, but I didn't read anything about 'You raised the
system specs! You bastards!'.

I was arguing against the "it works for me, so it must be your fault'.
Lots of people with 'ahead of the curve' systems are also having
problems, and dismissing all the problems as a result of sub-par systems
is as ridiculous as the standard 'It's your ISP' excuse when the servers
crash.
