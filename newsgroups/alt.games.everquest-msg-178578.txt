My Char is level 43, so I should be able to advance to 200. I neglected
to mention that brewing is 210, and I noticed no appreciable slowdown as
I approached 200 with it, and that was back at level 24. Swimming did
slow a bit as I approached 200, but nothing like the fishing skill. It
was about half again as long to get a skill up. It took about 40 minutes
to go from 195 to 200, and my WIS was then only about 107.
