    Ayup, and HPs. Gold BS is 35 MANA 25 HPs, the Plat BS neck is 55
MANA/HPs, the Vel BS neck is 65 MANA/HPs.

    I felt that same bit of annoyance, because I was deliberately keeping
WIS low to max out other things, anticipating the 18 WIS my epic would add.
Now I just add overall pool and don't worry about hitting 255, as it'll be a
while before I reach that.

    Heh. Remember, you are talking from the perspective of someone who is
maxing TWO ability scores (CHA and INT) at once. Look at the items the
wizard listed - I count in the neighbourhood of 90 INT on what she has now.
For a human WIZ, that puts her in the 180 range for total INT. And that's
before adding things like GEBs. Even a human wizard will hit 200, and then
you really have to think in terms of total MANA on an item and not just the
INT. Take the plat BS neck versus her neck (INT 5 MANA 15) now: at level 40,
they both give her 55 mana until she gets over 200 INT - THEN the plat BS
will be better.

    Now imagine she'd been a gnome WIZ, or Erudite, or pretty much any
non-Human race. Her base INT would be a lot higher, and she'd already be
making choices based on the reduced MANA per INT on INT over 200. My baby
gnome mage twink is sitting at 185ish INT, without many of the big ticket
INT items. She has no GEBs, Runed Cowl, SMR, something other than her Stein
of Ulyssia in Primary, she does have HP/MANA ears, etc. She'd gain 35 INT
from those changes. Saying there's no need for damned near ANYONE to go mana
over INT right now ignores the reduced mana per INT over 200, and just how
easy 200 INT can be to get for folks like mages, wizards, and necromancers.
( My 35 ENCH feels your pain - she's up to 165 INT/CHA, and while there's a
few "soft slots" the upgrades are gonna hurt the pocketbook. And her resists
are in the crapper. )
