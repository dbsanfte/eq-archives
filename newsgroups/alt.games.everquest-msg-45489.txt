maybe, but you should be laughing from the above reply.  personally I agree
with you that ass grabbing in this context is a personal affront, taking
liberties that wasn't in the name of seduction, but more along the lines of
molestation.  its a form of roleplaying, but its obviously meant to be
disruptive / disturbing.  The guy who posted above was definitely using
satire.

appearantly the god just ignored that event, instead of acting on it.  like
blushing or smacking the phat lewt grabber.
