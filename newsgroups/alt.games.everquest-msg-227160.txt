Hard missions when your group is average level 65 suck a lot more. You
really *need* a chanter, warrior, and cleric to do them and everyone has to
be well equipped with nearly 100 or more AA's. When you have that and a few
DPS classes hard missions arent that much harder than normal missions. Mobs
die just as fast, perhaps faster. You only get one mob in camp or perhaps
2-3 on occasion like normal missions. The only difference is that with
normal you can have double that amount of mobs in camp uncontrolled and
survive. On hard if you have 2-3 adds you risk total wipe.

I dont know how much easier hard missions are under 60 but im guessing they
dont require warriors with 8k HP and no one to have any AA at all so it must
be a lot better. I prefer normal missions because you succeed at them 99% of
the time. Hard missions can be touch and go where most the time you will
finish with 10 minutes or less left. Most people I know who do hard missions
regularily only do it for names and dont even try to finish and that way I
get zero points so thats not good for me at all.
