for a 51 cleric, it should be pretty easy for you to PL the warrior in Lake
of Ill Omen.  Follow the stream and hang a left when you hit the lake.  stay
near the mountains and don't go past the windmill.

I think everything will be red for a few levels to your wife for a while,
but with a 51 cleric...that should be no problem for you to keep her alive.

pull the mob back to the mountain, don't stay on the flat part.
