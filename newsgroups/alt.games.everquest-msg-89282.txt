Once a char has accumulated all the items for a quest that the NPC
involved in the quest requires, ie, Big Gut says bring me  etc,  etc
and etc and I will give you a Helm . How does the char present them
(read give) them to the NPC? Say there are four different items
involved this fictious combination: Maybe two snale fangs, one flawed
ruby and an orc belt  Does the char give them to the NPC one at a
time? Is there a way to give them all at once?
