Except, it doesnt attack another mob until the chanter tells it
to, and if they're doing it to annoy they wont until its obvious
you've stopped wasting mana.

Last time I fought a charmed mob there *were* no messages. In the
spam of battle and chat its pretty easy to think "I missed the
fizzle/hit/resist message" rather than "Oh, it didnt say anything
at all, it must be charmed."

And if you're /assisting on a critter, and that critter gets
charmed, /assist has helped you how? 

Darren, it sounds to me like you need to either learn to read
or come back in a better mood.
