Who knows if that was the read Brad McQuaid??? With this on test I think we
will see sooner rather than later. (Looks like someone using @home posted
this, not someone at Sony, unless they use @ home.)

I don't have an account on test but I just did a test download and it is one
of the patch files on test... If anyone has some info please let us all
know.
