I did not suggest that the style of play was in any way wrong, however,
I think I made it perfectly clear that completing an LDoN is in no way
something that the world needs to be informed of.  Last night, I with
the help of 53 of my closest nonguild allies completed ikkiniz 4, I
topped that off by soloing an Ukun Packmaster who dropped a muramite
rune.  I woke up this morning and soloed Ridgerunner Droongar.  If this
was my blog, these things would be interesting and worth commenting on.
 but its not, its alt.games.everquest, and its not all about me, or
chorkie.  In my last 12 nonraid playsessions I've completed a few
LDoNs(in a full group)  I never once felt that it was anything that
needed to be commented on here.  Perspective is important.    If you
want to impress, do impressive things, and start your first post here
with a tirade about how clerics are much more important than druids and
necros.  Neither is more important or more useful.
