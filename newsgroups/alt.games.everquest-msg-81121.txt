<shrug> it's an easy and convenient starting point. Like
most other newbies I don't know the ingame trade values
for every item.

Person was selling for 800 plat, using the fact
it was common and 450 plat on Allakhazams I got it
for 600 plat. So checking the site saved me 200.

And yes, I consider it an excellent weapon that
should carry me upto L40 at least. By which time
I might have the cash to afford an upgrade.

However your numbers simply enhance my argument. For
anyone playing a rogue as main, or only moderately
twinked, the affordability of the pick is its main
advantage.
