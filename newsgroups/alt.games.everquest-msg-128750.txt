so the loss of life isn't very important to you?  of course it isn't.  its
ignorant fucks like you that give Americans a bad name.
quit your blind preaching and lift a finger to do the research.  then do the
reasoning.  The oppression of any people is wrong.  The bombing of any
people is wrong.
it doesn't matter how long talks last as long as people aren't mistreated.
Isreal is oppressing the Palestinians and the Palestinians are reacting with
bombs.
No matter what peace deal is cut, Isreal has NO right to violate human
rights set forth by the U.N.!

inform yourself (again!)
