Yes, my main is a cleric and I have little experience with anything else 
yet but that's soon going to change and I am looking forward to it very 
much too.

I would disagree the cleric had nothing useful to do there. Sure, the 
tank starts with a lot of hitpoints but fighting bandits they must have 
worn him down in time such that he needed heals. Yes, that cleric was 
not going to CH him back up 800 hps or whatever, but he could keep him 
up against them I would think.

And I would never feel embarrassed if someone was buffed up. Goody for 
me! I'd just break out the trusty hammer and melee for what little it 
was worth then so I could build up my offense, 1hb and most importantly, 
defense skills. I always took advantage of any opportunity to melee as 
long as it wouldn't adversely affect my group. I particularly liked 
those times when we might have two clerics because I found most other 
clerics had little or no interest in fighting as I did. In fact, I had 
so much fun with this that I realized I'd really like playing a melee 
class later on and so just recently my Ogre Warrior was born. I'm sure 
he'll be a lot of fun to play.

Anyways, as a result of playing my cleric this way he has maxed out his 
offense, defense and 1hb and actually does pretty well as clerics go in 
soloing. I've soloed a lot in Natimbi and have it down to a science, 
taking advantage of every spell I have for this along with the skills I 
worked on and my trusty Hammer of Damnation, which procs almost 
constantly when I Yaulp. It's a lot of fun for something different and 
maybe one of these days I will finally get a Talisman of the Spiritseer 
to drop.

Excellent idea! I wish I had thought of that. Actually, my warrior is 
still in there so I think I'll do that with him. Thanks for the tip :-)

I agree. It's a great first experience for a new player with a little 
bit of many things they need to know. I think the new tutorial is quite 
good. It will be kind of fun to see what my best friend thinks of it, as 
I got him EverQuest Platinum for Christmas and will be there when he 
first tries it out I think.

The two of us were planning to jump into Anarchy Online this week but I 
think when he opens his present I will talk him into playing EQ first.
