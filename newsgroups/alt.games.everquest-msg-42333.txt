I have Black and White but I don't play it often...It is a really cool game
and all but as of lately I haven't been feeling the need to play any offline
games. (I like playing with my pet/creature, I was curious why it kept
saying the villagers are scared of em until I watched him one day eat one,
needles to say I slapped him silly.)

Dunno why I don't play it more...probably cause my computer sucks
