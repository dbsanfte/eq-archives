Assuming I were in your spot, and assuming you're an officer in your
guild as I am in mine, these would be the actions I'd take:

1) Due to his bragging about it and thereby showing that it was quite
a deliberate action, I'd hunt him down and deguild him.

2) Due to the *lack* of disapproval shown by the other officers, and
thereby showing their own lack of moral fibre, I'd then deguild
myself.  It's time to find a better guild.
