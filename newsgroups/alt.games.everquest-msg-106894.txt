True, but trained is trained, and when it rolls over you it hardly
matters what level the person who started it was. Any player worth a
sneeze knows to be on guard at all times in Blackburrow.

In addition to his obvious problems, Freds complain seems to stem from
jealousy of the horse, though I wouldn't care to speculate what part
of the horse Fred is jealous of. Certainly he's already a well
developed horses ass, so it must be something else.
