On 2 brother mobs in the 'Iceshard Keep' in the south side of Kael.
Also called the chanter house.  1 hour spawn, both have the last name
Iceshard.

Note that it is TRIVIALLY easy for rogues to sneak in and pickpocket
these off them, so chances are if they have been up for a while they
are already cleaned off.

PS good luck with the shawl, love mine.
