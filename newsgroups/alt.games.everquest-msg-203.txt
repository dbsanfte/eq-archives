I've never seen or heard of anyone finding the port to GD.  If
anyone did have it, though, the place would still be safer to port
to than iceclad.  Only people that have already been to the zone
can use the port, so you don't have a group unable to get their
bearings or normally deal with the odd drakkal wolf or giant. And
its the odd one that you are going to see.  Yes, there likely -is-
one in aggro range, but unlike iceclad there is no ring wall to
concentrate them and restrict your flight path.  Fight the one that
aggros on the spot and you likely won't get an add.  Run, and you
will almost certainly be able to steer to Thurgadin or the EW line
without running into an add.

Get SoW before porting.  If you aren't a druid and have none
handy, take a drink from your tenpack.  I know, at 10pp a sip,
you reserve that for dangerous situations...well, porting to
Iceclad (or hypothetically GD) is dangerous business.  If it
isn't dangerous for you, then you won't be complaining that it
is!
