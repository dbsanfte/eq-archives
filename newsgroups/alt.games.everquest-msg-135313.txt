The character select screen looks great.

The new interface looks nice for the most part... few niggling things though

Why is the pet window open by default?  Theres more pet-less classes in EQ
than pet-classes

Why don't the settings apply themself to all characters on your account (or
at least have an option to toggle).  I spent 30-40mins customising my window
for my monk, then logged onto another char (same account, same computer) and
it was the default screen again.  Grrr all that work needing to be re-done.

Right clicking an item for stats.. if you dont hold the button down long
enough, the stats stay on the screen in a permanent box

Fding.. but the height is still the same.  Surely if i FD I should be
looking from a very low perspective

How the hell do you close a window fast?  I don't like using mouse much.. in
a laggy zone or raid using the mouse is unbearable.  I want the escape key
to close all these new additional windows.. or Alt+F4.. i dont care what,
just an option to do it.

Bazaar... love this, still buggy though.  It says just set prices for the
items you wish to sell. If the item has no price associated with it, it wont
be for sale..

Well this is a lie.. if you dont give EVERY item a price in ALL your trader
bags, it says in red "you must be in a merchant npc area in order to offer
your items".. such a misleading error message to try and fix it.  I ran all
over the damn zone with the lag of 400 people, clicking "trader" a zillion
times, before discovering the solution.

Now it is working though, it rocks.  I sold a ton of stuff in the first
night (which worries me that i messed up with my prices and sold WAY too
cheaply) but it was just junk cluttering my bank right?   The 30 item limit
sucks.. I've got 65 items for sale on my mule atm, but unless I am at the
screen and they /tell me, they are unable to buy anything past item number
30 (And i wont ever be playing/looking at the screen while in bazaar mode)

I dont like the layout of the armour slots now.. it doesnt make any sense
like the old way did.

The Exp/AA bar is worse now too.. I find the new blue bar at the bottom so
much more difficult to calculate exp than the old system (thin blue bar
through the middle of the yellow bar remember)

Zones like GD and EW are still a bitch to read certain chats.. if i was ever
in a lengthy conversation in these zones, I would always F10 into small
screen mode.. not a possibility now.

Chat windows..  I never used the hitsmode thing before, and it sure is nice
to have fight spam out of the chat window.. its a pain having to look at
both screens during pulling though.  Id like mobs agro messages, mobs
faction messages, and the exp messages all in 1 window with my damag
done/received.

Percentage HP is pretty nice (tho no real use).. i like watching it on big
mob fights

Currently I have to watch the main window to check a mob hasnt given his
agro text speach (a vital early warning sign on some pulls).  I also have to
check the melee damage window, to make sure a silent mob didnt sneak up on
me.. the "cannot see target" and "target is out of range" messages don't go
into the same box either.. which strikes me as weird.

Buff icons..  dear me, these were supposed to be improvements?

Chat windows also seem buggy to me.. on my bot computer (cleric) I have 2
windows,  "general/main" and the raid healing channel.. if i type a command
in the raid healing channel, it still gives the output in the mainwindow -
thats cool.  If i type a message in that window though, it sends it as
/say.. wheras typed in the main window, it sends it as /group.    Its going
to be confusing, and cause some embarassing moments of mistells.

Its certainly very different.. and I think it will take a lot of getting
used to..  with this many critical points of it, im sure some people will
think im never satisfied :p   Overall I do actually like it.. would love
some of the above changes tho.. above all, A QUICK CLOSE WINDOW KEY PLZ!!!!
