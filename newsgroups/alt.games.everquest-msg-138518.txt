Many mages have seen more than 4 summoned pets hit a mob,
you're not alone.  However, several of us have seen a 
charmed or direcharmed pet avoid engaging a mob with 4 pets
on it already.  Given that summoned pets are no longer
NPC's (see changes to Sword of Runes) and more PC like,
I think that is the distinguishing difference.
