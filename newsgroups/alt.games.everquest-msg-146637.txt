I don't believe this, so don't get pissed at me... but here is how I
understand it.

Basically, by quad-kiting you exploit mobs by stacking them (rounding them
up tightly, and they tend to be on top of each other) which is not how they
were meant to be killed.

Once again, I do not believe that - I'm just stating how I understand it. In
my opinion, it's a perfectly acceptable way to kill things, and people that
bring that exploit argument are people that are simply annoyed that they do
not have that capability.
