You know I think you may be headed in the right direction with these
theories, but I just don't think you've quite caught on to the evil plan
yet.  My theory is that soon there really won't be on line servers at
all.  The front end will create the illusion of logging you into a
server, but really the entire game will be played on your local PC.  All
other character actions which appear to be random acts generated by
player input will in fact be simulated by the client based on previous
actions of that character.  Random new chars will be generated by the
client to beg for pp and sow plz to provide the illusion of a dynamic
player base.  With this system in place they resolve all connectivity
issues, server load issues, bandwidth issues, as well as many others
without actually resolving them.  Why would they do such a thing you
might ask?  My theory is that alien space babies have taken command of
their brains.
