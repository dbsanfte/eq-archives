The dungeon will be exactly the same regardless of whether you have 6 or
3 when you accept the mission. I'm not sure why they've changed this,
maybe for people who just want to have a private dungeon dispite little
hope of actually finishing it on time.

Nod. Unlike some others, I don't see this as a big deal. It makes more
sense with the map tool now that sense heading is a pretty obsolete
idea, and I don't particularly think it was a very good one in the first
place. A lot like the original spell book, it's one of those things that
may have sounded good in the design document, or was thrown in because
the diku muds they were copying had it, but other than that it really
was tedious to raise until they added /doability. Even having to have
the button on the same number hotkey in every bank was a dumb workaround
that shouldn't have been in the game to begin with. I think originally,
having a compass in your inventory should have just thrown a compass
window like the current one up on screen, and that would have worked
fine and been much more "realistic" than the magic skill of knowing what
direction you were facing which would still fail once you had fully
mastered it.
