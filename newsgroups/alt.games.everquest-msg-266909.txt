   Well, well all have to wait for at least a week.  InsaneChicken.com just
wrote a very polite letter to let me know that while they try to ship
within 24 hours, they ran out of the Mad Dog Revenge and won't be able to
ship till Thursday morning. 

    That's ok. Gives our thief another week to take his/her taste buds for
granted.
