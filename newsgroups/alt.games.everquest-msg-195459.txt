I've played my Kitty Shaman up to 34, so here is my perspective on
your questions...

>Stat boosts.  Do any of these have much effect at low levels, or
>are they really just "ooh its a buff, that must be helping"

Personally I think they are a waste of time and mana at the lower
levels. They don't last very long, only bump the stat a little and are
murder on your mana pool (especially if you have a buff hungry group).
By your mid-20s your buffs will last longer and bump the stats up much
better. 

>Currently I can boost
>
>Dex.  Proc rates (not many people at this level have proccing
>weapons, I sure don't) and maybe skill ups?
>Agility.  A tiny bit of AC and nothing else?

Dex and Agil had no effect as far as I can tell. The low level buffs
do not push the numbers up high enough to matter.

>Strength.  More damage per hit?  Not a lot more, but perhaps it
>adds up

I only used it when encumbered or near encumbered.

>Stamina.  HP boost, mostly.  See HP buff below.  At least this
>one stacks on top of everyone else's HP totals

I always cast the Stam buff on myself (and group members)

>AC boost.  Damage mitigation.  But AC in small increments rarely
>has much effect at all, as a cleric at 65 I'm pretty convinced AC
>boosts are useless 99% of the time and "mostly useless" the rest
>of the time.  Plus this one costs a component!

Yup, I agree totally worthless.

>HP Boost.  This is good, sadly at my level Inner Fire is good for
>10 or 15 hp worth of boost.  5% of my pathetic HP total, maybe
>half of that of an actual tank or half decent twink (was grouped

>doesn't stack with cleric/druid buffs, but on the bright side,
>its the most mana efficient heal I've got or will have till
>somewhere around 20.

InnerFire rocks! :-)

>Resist Buffs.  Another set of pretty useless buffs, at low levels
>the amount resists are boosted by are low, and the number of
>caster mobs you are facing also tend to be low. 

Yup, I didn't even buy the low level ones. I learned how useless they
were with my caster and druid alts.

>Nukes.  These are painfully tiny so far, useful for pulling and
>getting evocation up but thats about it.

Yup, good for pulling and skill training.

>DoTs.  These seem to be effective.  Irritatingly, though, they
>have a DD component which can break root. 

Pull with the DoT, then root. Slows and DoTs are your true strength.
Once you've softened up the mob, you can easily finish with melee.

>Heals.  At my level, Light Heal, which is pretty much the same as
>a cleric heal... that will change at 14.  I won't get the next
>one till 19, so for the next several levels I'll be dropping well
>behind the healer curve I suppose.  Looks like that race goes on
>like that all the way up the ladder.

14-19 SUCKS! bigtime for a Shaman. Some of the toughest levels for the
class (unless hunt in Paludal :-P).

>Slow.  I mock the slow.. 

Never "mock the slow"! It may not look like it's doing much, but it is
the most powerful line of spells in the game in my opinion.

>At 14 I'll get the next slow which will start at 23% (almost
>doubling amount of slow... for three times the cost!).  

The biggest advantage to slowing the mob when soloing is the ability
to get more spells of (especially root!) when the mob is beating on
you. Never underestimate the power of slow.

>Canabalize.  Not till 24, thats a loooong ways off. Something to
>look forward to I suppose
>
>Regen.  At  24, which is also a long ways off, but not nearly so
>far as the druid regen was.

Great combo for getting mana back fast. Very powerful tool.

>Befriend Animals.  At 29... but wow, why don't I ever see shamen
>using this one?  

I spent most of 29-34 grouping, so I never really got the chance to
use it. At 34 I now have a real pet.

>Haste.  Not till 29, and vastly inferior to chanter haste at that
>level.  Still, without chanter handy, for 80 mana for 5+ minutes
>of 30% more DPS from a melee, this has got to be a good deal most
>of the time.

Haste is always good.

>Invisibility.  Not till 29.  Man, thats unbelievable, 29 levels?
>Could be worse, a cleric gets it never... but wow, not even a
>self only version till here.

Like you mentioned better than no invis at all :-P

>Pet.  Not till 34.  And I thought 9 levels for a beastlord was a
>long time to wait!  Still, unlike clerics and druids, this pet
>seems to be effective from 34 on.  Cleric pets are effective for
>4 or 5 levels, druid pets seem to be effective never (well, for

>further down the list, it seems you get a new pet every spell
>level from here on, so this is less mysterious than it seems.

Dog-Dog is EXTREMELY fragile compared to the true pet classes. You
need to use the proper strategy to get the most out of your furry
friend.

DoT/Root/Slow/Melee/Tank/Heal
