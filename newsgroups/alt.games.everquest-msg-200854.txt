Believe it or not every single game I've had that has been unstable in the
last year has had that instability fixed with a driver update to my pos
onboard sound chip (not soundblaster).

Check seating of the sound card (you never know), I'd wiggle your ram in the
sockets as well

I've got 1 gb of ram, had it for nearly 8 months now, not a single problem
in EQ. Also had Direct X 9.0 since release because the beta I was in at the
time upgraded to requiring it a week after release, no problems either.

Something that has been successful for me (I work at a PC shop) on unstable
machines sometimes:
Pop the case and get a can of compressed air (or air compressor). Blow the
case out (best if you can do this outside, can generate a lot of dust). Once
you have it blown out once, including all the vents/fans and Powersupply,
pull all the ram and cards, blow the slots out (you want it fairly clean
FIRST).
unplug and reseat the hard./cd/floppy cables (power and data) and the
motherboard power cables. If you can do it without 15 min of work (some AMD
fans are a pita), pop off the heatsink/fan, and just work the lever up then
down on the ZIF socket.. no need to remove the processor, and put the
heatsink back on, put all the boards and memory back in, and give it another
shot. I've cured 30 or more machines with a good cleaning that were
unstable, but we could never find a real problem component. People at work
still say it's BS, but it works.

If that doesn't fix it, try swapping the dimm positions and running your
stability tests. Those other programs might not be getting into the 'bad
ram' segmants as well as EQ is.
