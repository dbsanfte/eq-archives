ROFL

Neither troll nor flame Roj, just a pointed observation on the
state of the game.  The OP asked for advice and I stand by my
response.  Don't bother playing a class whose primary strength
is completely worthless in forced single-group content.  SOE's
"solution" is a handful of "short bus" encounters, it wouldn't
be funny if it was a joke.

SOE farmed out caster level aggro generation to Warriors, thus
eliminating the _only_ reliable Knight tanking advantage that
balanced the enormous raw tanking survivability advantage
Warriors have over all other melee.  In addition to that, they
_increased_ the Warrior survivability advantage.  And now,
Knights are left trying to be useful with tank level DPS, DPS
class survivability, and "utility" that is deliberately
rendered useless or near useless vs. non-trivial content.

Knights will be ok short of the highend, for a while, because
their spellcasting still has real value in most settings short
of GoD.  But already their ineffectiveness at the highend has
begun to affect player perception of them in the rest of the
game, just as it did during Kunark.

Shaman are in a similar situation, with their signature slows
severly mitigated and their heals inadequate even as the #2
healer in a group trying to cope with mobs in forced single-
group content that are doing 2k DPS.

The only thing more amazing than SOE's oft-demonstrated lack of
understanding of the interplay of their own game mechanics, are
players I've encountered whining about Paladins playing in
"god-mode" _after_ the Warrior aggro changes made them about
equal in attractiveness and effectiveness for groups doing
single-group PoP and LDoN.  It takes a special sort of nitwit
to whine "A is too powerful compared to B" and then, once "B"
is made equally powerful to go on whining "A is too powerful",
especially given changed circumstances that have completely
emasculated "A" by making "B"s unique strengths an absolute
requirement for forced single-group content.
