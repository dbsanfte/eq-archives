I have experienced this as well...  My main is a lvl 22 Ranger (I began
playing the game at the beginning of October and she was my only character
up until last week when I made a Druid alt who is now almost 6th level.
Gnoll Pups, while light blue, no longer give my druid xp.  Nor do Bats,
rats, snakes and other newbie zone light blues...

However, when my lvl 22 was in EF killing Mammoths, she would pick off the
occasional Lt. Blue calf (at lvl 21 I should clarify) and the lt blue calves
would give her xp.

I think that there are still some little problems needing to be worked out
with the coding eh?  hehe
