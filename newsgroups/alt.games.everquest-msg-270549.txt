I once worked for about 18 hours straight on an extremely difficult to 
reproduce bug in a product that was being developed for IBM. And at the 
time the IBM contract was dependant on finding and fixing that failure 
as rapidly as possible or a major source of revenue to the company would 
be lost. Needless to say, there was more than a little pressure to 
isolate and reproduce the problem. Given that experience I can imagine 
the atmosphere the EQ II crew is working in to fix this problem.
