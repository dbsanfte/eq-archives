They may have been green to you, but not to them. I am seeing lower and
lower level groups invading CB these days. Lets face it, until you get
to level 10, corpse recovery is not a problem, but you get great
experience. 

The major problem is that these group don't have the continual fire
power to continually kill the mobs and have to take significant Medd
time outs and/or generally fart around wasting time. 


The rule of camping as I understand it is "first in-best dressed" until
your group dies/flees, then it is open slather again. Not a lot of
people like this last bit, but it is the only fair way (hold your place
or loose it).

In this case and place, I'd ask why they were not killing. If they were
up for a while, then I would ignore their complaints. CB is a rather
quick respawn anyway. If you camp, then you kill, you don't hatch/horde
it.


<flamebait> 
Frankly, you have little to lose (sp?). 
Maybe your guild might be anal retentive and turf you if a complaint is
lodged?
Unless you are in an "uberguild", there is always another useless guild
around the corner.[1]

Or worse, {:-) you go on the "ignore" list of someone who would never
help you anyway.

People who get abusinve in the game are not worth being in the good
books of anyway. There are so many others to help before them.
