Funny thing is, prices on a lot of things have shot UP since the
Bazaar. CLS's were starting to drop, Bazaar pushed them right back up.
On some prices, Steins of Moggok have *doubled* in price because of
the Bazaar. Bone chips easily sell for a plat *each*. Items that were
previously worthless because they were too much trouble to stand
around and /auction all day sell easily, giving them actual value.
Pay more attention, Dennis...

Yes, some prices have dropped. But, just as many, if not more, have
risen dramaticly.
