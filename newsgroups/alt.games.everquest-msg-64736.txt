Hi guys, here is the deal.

Computer is a EQ box, there's nothing else installed beside Everquest.
Computer specs is:
P4 1.6 ghz
256 DDR PC800
W2k with SP2
Gforce2 GTS 64
SoundBlaster pci 16
DX8.1

Prior to the patch (12/4) everything works fine. I didn't have to mess
with DX7/DX8 thingy in the eqclient.ini.

Right after the patch, I logged in and noticed crappy lines going all
around the screen. I thought it was a driver issue with my Gforce and
went ahead to download the 23.11 detonator drivers. Installed it but no
good, same thing.

I took some screenshots to show the issue. Here is the link:

There is also my DxDiag.txt and Eqclient.ini.

Does anyone got the same issues here or I am the only one?

I am thinkng about re-installing the game and re-run the patch, may be
some file got corrupted.

Thanks for any input on this matter
