Its spell haste. If you have a high level shaman bot on a seperate account
I suppose thats not such a big deal - for me, though, its still great
when soloing or grouped without a 'real' haster.

If you go to www.zymurgy.org/~pingu and click on 'Stuff' you'll see
my gear. While the worn stuff isnt going to be terribly helpful for
you, the bagged stuff may well show some utility items I dont recall
off the top of my head that I consider useful enough to carry around
with me. 

There are also some nice quested items you can get if you
like; Spirit wracked cords, the Chardok ring, Coldain ring, Coldain
prayer shawl, are all still pretty decent. I suppose LDON may have
changed the nature of time investment though; I'm not sure if you 
could just buy and augment up similar items with a similar time
investment now. Not as much fun though ;)

Yeah, if you dont want to get the key for your ranger. They're kind
of nice things to have though, it means you can always go help your
friends get the cloak and such ;)
