I don't know what your talking about? Everytime I've seen a PKer take
out a lower level "newbie" there has been a slew of higher level players
hunt them down and kill em. Maybe I just got lucky. But I have notice
that alot of the "Newbie" Freeport humans go PK crazy when another
player from a different team shows up. Oh well. I've yet to have problems
with my halfling rogue and iksar warrior. I've never seen a PKer near
Cabilis
pickin off newbies! That would be suicide!
