Since there hasn't been much new in EQ lately, I'm sort of curious.  What
other games do people here play?  What games to they own?  What games do
they own, but never play?  :)  For myself, I play EQ off and on.  (I'm
almost infamous for my tendancy to vanish for several months at a time.  Or
I would be, if anyone could remember who the hell I am when I return.)  I
also tend to rotate through a distressingly large number of other games,
both for PC and Playstation.  Currently, I'm only really playing EQ, Diablo
II, Starcraft, Sacrifice, and Emperor: Battle for Dune.  I also play Bloody
Roar or Darkstalkers every now and then, if I have a half-hour to kill and
can't think of anything more constructive to do, like reading or washing
the dishes or bludgeoning away at trying to learn how to draw or how to
speak Japanese.  I'm part way through Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment,
and Icewind Dale, but haven't actually played any of them for about two
months.  Ditto for Black and White (it's basically on hold until Lionhead
releases a few more patches, and until I've gotten a computer that can run
it at more than three frames per minute.)  And I've got saved games for
Final Fantasy 5 through 9, Legend of Legaia, Lunar: Silver Star Story, and
Chrono Cross, but haven't played them since December or so.

For non-computer games, I've got RoboRally, which I haven't played in about
two years, and a big pile of pencil and paper roleplaying stuff.  Most of
the books for Mekton Z and Big Eyes, Small Mouth, most of the hardcover
books for D&D 3rd Edition, and just about every add-on for the Monstrous
Compendiums ever printed.  Oddly enough, I've never actually played a
pencil and paper RPG.  I just like collecting the monsters, I guess.  :) 
And of course, I have a few classic board games like Mancala, Chess, and
Checkers.  (Mostly because these are the only games I can actually coerce
family members into actually playing.  My last attempt at teaching someone
how to play RoboRally almost resulted in a double stroke - one for me due
to frustration, and one for them due to confusion and boredom.)
