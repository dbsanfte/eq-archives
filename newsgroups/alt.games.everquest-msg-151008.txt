Hehe..depends how experienced you are ?
Ive got a friend that when they are in CT they dont use a chanter..YES i
know that some say you must have that there cause of adds and someone who
mezz em.
But you actually dont !
You can aswell use a bard for mezz, but when they play ( 1 group ) bard
turns into fireform ( you know when they look like a Mage pet ) and gets all
aggro cause of AE song and the others..usually 1 shammi, cleric, 2 rouge,
War finish the others.
And i never seen em wipe..ok they are from an Uber guild on my server ( AB )
but they dont use a chanter
