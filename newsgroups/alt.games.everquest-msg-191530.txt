I don't know the exact formulas, but it's all relative to what you are
fighting.   Your weapon skill and offence skill vs the mob's defense skill.
So low skill doesn't mean much at level 10, because the mobs have such a low
level needed to hit them.   But at higher levels, a skill that has fallen
far behind the max for it's level will produce a *lot* more misses, and when
it does hit, those hits will usually be for minimum damage or close to it.
