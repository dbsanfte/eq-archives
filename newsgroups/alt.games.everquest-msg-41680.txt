So, we should lock them up in jail? And then their brothers
(or some other un-branched member of their family tree) will
take airplanes/schools/<you pick it> hostage and demand the
release of their "unfairly treated" terrorist brother and BOOM!
Now you have both of them out on the street and the released
terrorist looks all the more heroic and you've created a
second hero in his brother.

This same scenario has happened before (although the terrorists
were held in other countries).

No matter what you do, they are terrorists -- worthless cowardly
scum of the earth who do NOBODY any good AT ALL.  Wipe them out,
make them extinct (if it were possible, of course) and you've
done nothing but better the world.

Options:

1) Process the terrorist judicially.  Outcome: we are evil satan
loving pigs and they will continue to terrorize us because we
have "wronged their holy leader" and want him released.

2) Do nothing.  Outcome: we are evil satan loving pigs and they
will continue to terrorize us because we are "spineless."

3) Kill the terrorists and their friends.  Outcome: we are evil
satan loving pigs that they *might* think twice about fucking with
in the future.

I'll take #3.
