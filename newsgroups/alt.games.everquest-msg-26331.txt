Well ya, you might think that <G>.  Personally I think Brad was here all
along reading and not posting.  From past experience (and I know this is
gonna make some folks laugh) I would say he is a reasonably intelligent
person and it would make good sense to read not just this group but many
others, the more you know about players and what they are thinking the
better off you are, both in terms of controlling what you don't want
them to do and encouraging them to do what you do want.  Of course if my
supposition regarding him being reasonably intelligent is wrong then the
rest of my theory goes out the window <EG>.  I mean how many times have
I offered to let him give me a big salary to tell him how I think games
should be made without a response?  Maybe I am giving him too much
credit hehe, or maybe that is the proof that he is smart enough to not
be associated with me.
