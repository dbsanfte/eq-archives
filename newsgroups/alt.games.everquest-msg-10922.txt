I haven't had very good luck with using charm to solo.  But I find it
works wonderfully in a group where there is someone to cover my back. 
If the group pulls a couple mobs and one is a green or blue con caster I
often charm the caster, assist main tank, and /pet attack.  

I generally warn the group that I might be casting charm, and try to let
them know which mob is charmed.  Otherwise they might waste quite a bit
of effort on it.  

I've heard that higher charisma makes charm last longer.  Boosted mine a
bit and it seems to help.
