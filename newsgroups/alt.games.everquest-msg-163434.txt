Picking up my copy of McVaxius's Berserker Cresendo in the PoK
library, I happened across a song I'd missed somehow.

Sionache's Dreams
Level 40, Wind

From the icon, I'm guessing its a mez or mana drain or something
along those lines, red box around a red profile facing left, like
pixie strike at al.

Had to log right away, and for some reason I'm unable to log onto
the web although mail and newsgroups are working fine.

Is this new, or did I just miss it somehow (or even blatently
decide not to bother getting it, its so useless)

For that matter, anyone have a description of what the cresendo
does?  Looks like a stats boosting haste, brass based though, not
sure I'll ever want to use it.
