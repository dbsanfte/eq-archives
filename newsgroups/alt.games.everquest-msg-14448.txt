I'm assuming you have plenty of cash, as this approach is the fast/expensive
method.

The best place to do this is EFP as everything you need is close by.

Train to max (25).
Make sheets of metal from metal bits. When these trivial:
Make banded gorgets. When these trivial:
Make banded sleeves. When these trivial:
Make banded cloaks.

You are now at skill 175.

From now on it gets hard ! Basically you have two kinds of armour you can
sensibly make:

1) finesteel for profit and skill-ups. A pain because mq ore can only be
found in Steamfont or Rathe and it weighs a ton.
2) Your cultural armour. this is a pain because the metal is expensive and
the temper you need requires pain-in-the-arse to get components. Oh and
you'll need a master brewer to make the tempers. Personally I would always
make the enchanted version (imbued in the case of iksar) as this results in
some usable armour despite being *much* harder to make. unenchanted simply
isnt worth the effort. This requires help from a level 49+ enchanter - but
then I am one so that makes it easier for me - or in the case ok Iksar a
level 49 (I think) shammy to imbue the gems.

www.eqtraders.com is a great sight for all this kind of thing.
