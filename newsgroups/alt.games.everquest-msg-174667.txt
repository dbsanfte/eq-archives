I agree completely, the only good terrorist is a dead one.  I just don't
happen to think that taking out the entire muslim population of the world,
as some have advocated here, is the way to go about it.  Religion has been
twisted by people of just about all faiths in order to justify whatever it
is they want to do.  All that I, and some others here are pointing out is
that this is the case with Islam as well.  Islam itself does not advocate
the types of actions these terrorists are taking, it is just being twisted
and used as an excuse.
