Well, his 'puckish sense of humor' gretly interferes with my roleplaying 
suspension of disbelief.  And in that case, at least, my snap decision 
turned out to be spot on.

Well, yes, you _can_ always make snap decisions.  But you'd be wise to 
consider revising them if they prove to be erroneous.

}and as long as its not used for other porpoises.  

Wow, where do porpoises spawn and what do they drop? :)  Most of my 
special-purpose only gonna be around for 3 levels characters end up with 
name generator names.  But I've been naming a fair portion of them 
'Trinkle' lately for some reason... I have Trinkles on two servers camped 
underwater in the Qeynos pond, in fact. :) I really don't think "I'm only 
gonna exist in your world for a few hours" is a good excuse for having an 
inappropriate name, especialy since the name generator makes it so easy 
for the creatively challenged.  If you're only gonna be there a few hours, 
it shouldn't matter much what you're called to you, either, and then 
_nobody_ gets annoyed.

Sure, deranged sense of humor, whatever.  I might even have laughed at 
'gottanyseafoam' for about 12 seconds before it started to irritate me.  
But 'canusparemesomepp' hit all the wrong buttons absolutely 
immediately...  First, it's begging rather than buying, second, there's 
the degree to which it violates the naming policy (Rule 11), third there's 
the effect on my suspension of disbelief, fourth, the usage of 'u' for 
'you'... and ultimately, that the guy immediately started confirming my 
preconceptions of him.
