Thanks for all the flames, much obliged.  Anyway what I was trying to
say is that STA for STA, Warriors will have more HP's.  But there are
cases when Knights will have more.  If you all don't remember, they
PATCHED SK/PAL and gave them increased HP's.  They are on a HP scale
EXTREMELY close to that of Warriors.

Lets take some examples of small race Warriors and starting STA.  The
starting STA ranges from 75-85.  Now lets take some large race SK's,
the starting STA ranges from 114-127.  Now lets add 0 STA to both
large and small races and both classes to make this more fair since
Warriors have + HP's and the SK's I picked have more STA.  I can
almost guarantee the Large race will have more HP's than small race
warriors level 1-60.

I am not saying Warriors aren't the best tanks, I play a small race
Warrior and enjoy it.  All I am saying is that there are many cases
even with STA distributed evenly between races and classes that the SK
will still have more HP's.  Hell my friend has a 54 SK and he gets 6.5
hps per STA.  That is way close to what a Warrior gets per STA.  I
originally thought of this while reading the EQ developer's forum that
SK's were complaining about lack of HP's.  Since someone asked who the
heck were "they".  Go read the developers forum for yourself and see. 
And also as the reply that WARRIORS will always have "way" more HP's,
and that CH will ALWAYS be more efficient on a Warrior, which is
usually the case but there are certain times when a fatty SK will have
more HP's.

BTW thanks to the defensive discipline, I think even small race
warriors are the best at tanking the uber mobs.
