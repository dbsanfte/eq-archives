OK, here is the entire post by Alan:

"I'm not really sure where this rumor started, but there is talk about town
that we announced something called Exodus at E3 or that someone heard from
someone's brother's roommate's third cousin.
The rumor is that we'll be making one expansion after Planes of Power and
then folding up shop.

It's not true. Not even a little bit true.

Sure, we're known for our interesting expansion names (and acronyms), but
this isn't one of them.

We do not plan to stop working on EverQuest until you folks decide it's time
for us to stop. It's your participation in the endeavor that will keep us
going. For as long as you want to play our game, we'll continue to do our
best to entertain you."

He is saying several things here.

1.  There is no expansion called Exodus in the plans.

2.  Everquest will continue to be worked on for as long as people want to
play it.  (Assumption here is that means enough people to support it)

He did not outright say there will be more expansions, I will grant you that
much, he most certainly did not say there will not be any more expansions.
He said work on EQ will continue.  Generally speaking, this has meant
patching up problems, patching in new content, and releasing new expansions.
One can reasonably assume that when he says work will continue, that there
will likely be new expansions.

Where in his statement did he say there will be no more expansion after PoP?

The only thing he has ruled out as far as expansions is one that is
specifically called Exodus.  Nowhere does he say that there will be no more
expansions.
