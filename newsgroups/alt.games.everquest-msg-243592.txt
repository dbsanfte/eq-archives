Really? What are we talking about then? Assuming we call it a game..
is the game not played on planet earth with live human beings? If I go
down to the market to buy a shirt or go to the bazaar to buy a
breastplate, how is this different? The only change is the interface
into how each is accessed and what you can do with it. My feeling is
this... if you construct items that subsist over time in this
universe.. whether out of dirt, steel, or bits of electronic memory
sitting on a server and allow people the ability to trade, buy, and
sell it.. you have the same dynamics for your economy if it exists on
an Everquest server or Wall Street.

I've been thinking about this thread the past day or so. What really
struck me is why SOE doesn't cut IGE off at the knees? I mean.. they
did it for the most part with EQWindows, they've now posted recipes in
order to minimize the access to EQTraders, at every turn they seek to
incorporate features into their game that other sites have grown up
around filling. So why not IGE? I propose the following.

All that needs to happen is that Sony needs to create an in game
currency which will always track 1-1 with US currency. Lets call them
'credits'. Wrap a little story around the credits and wayfarers with
the rules being this. You may transfer one US dollar off your credit
card and get one credit in game. 1.01 credits is $1.01 and so on. Once
you have credits, the only thing they can be used for is to trade for
items from other players or it can be transferred back on a 1-1 basis
to US currency. If it is to trade for something ubiqitous like pp the
pp seller turns in a specific amount of pp to an NPC for a token.. say
a 10K token ala the weight bag tokens, and then transfers that. Now,
the caveat is this.. any transaction using credits is subject to a tax
meant to both penalize the player for not earning the credits/items in
game and to pay for upkeep on the system, the security involved, etc.

Once that system is implemented and sound, you basically remove IGE as
the middleman and can do fun things like adding a credit cost to
bazaar items, a current credit amount to bank windows, etc. One of the
stupidest things Sony can do in my opinion is to partner with IGE when
they can just create their own and leave them with no customers. As
easy as it sounds.. you would basically end up having to create an
interface to a bank within Everquest to support the system, and all
the problems with security that entails. But its nothing that won't
eventually have to be addressed at one time or another as these worlds
become fully functional in relation to and with our own.
