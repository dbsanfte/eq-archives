That's the approach I take too. I don't feel that I have a particularly poor
memory, but we ain't none of us getting any younger now are we...regardless,
there's little chance I'll remember specifics about someone I put on /ignore
weeks or months ago. So I take a conservative approach to it and then just
trust that they made it on there for good reason. Seems to work out fine in
practice. (I haven't found such a clear system for the /friends list yet for
some reason.)
