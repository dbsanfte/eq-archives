What in god's name was *that* 

Your character needs more skill at 1hb to get a better attack stat.
If you train and practice (i.e. use) 1hb it will go up.
Then so will your attack.

If you are looking for general efficiency then look at the ratio of
Damage to delay.

If you are looking for high damage then look only at the damage (and any
damage bonus)

Now go and wash your mouth out.
Do you kiss your mother with those fingers ... errr
