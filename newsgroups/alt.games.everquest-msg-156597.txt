Have no experience with this whatsoever, but this is what I've heard.
There's a program out called EqMacro (or something like that) which
basically lets you automate trade skills. I beleive the idea is you find a
tradeskill that makes a small amount of money. Set up the macros to automate
it, and leave it running while you're at work, sleeping, or just let it run
on a second account. Result: unlimited platinum.

At least that's my guess as to what's going on. And I'm also guessing that
anyone caught doing anything of the sort will be instantly banned from the
game.
