After killing more ulthorks than I care to count, getting stacks of
meat, a nice number of tusks, armor, weapons, and random junk, last
night an Ulthork warrior dropped Ulthork Whiskers. First time I saw it
drop. Didn't come up in a search on alakhazam or in quest items by
zone.  Anyone know what this is for? It's tradabl and not lore, tiny,
all/all so I figured either trash or a quest item, but fairly rare.

I kept it because I'd feel stupid to destroy it, never see another, and
find out it's the missing rare component for the player tailored, wizard
only, "Pointy Hat of the Stereotypes" (AC 1 with three right clickable
charges of true north, plus 3 CHA)
