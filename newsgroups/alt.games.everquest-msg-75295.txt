Indeed, though that pisses me off even more.  EQ has a great back story that
they don't utilize like they could.  I really wouldn't have known how
fleshed out the EQ world is if I hadn't downloaded a help file with all the
background.

Same could be said for EQ.

That's not being fair to Richard.  If RvR is what he's looking forward to,
then don't discount it.  That's like asking "what do you like about
Toyota's, other than the fact that they're amazingly reliable?"

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
