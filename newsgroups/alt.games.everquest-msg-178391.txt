    If I made a chanter stop what they were doing, come find me, then cast
KEI I would expect to pay a lot more than 10pp.

    I'm talking about donations to people who sit in nexus and buff full
groups of donaters with it.

    Assuming they only buff one group every 5 mins (ha ha) and everyone only
pays 10pp, these guys haul out 720pp an hour with no risk. The real figure
I'd say to guess would be *somewhat* higher, being that most people gasp
when i tell them I donate 10pp and im usually rushed in and rushed out of a
full group of buffees when i get the buff.

    Well, I guess at very high levels money doesnt mean as much to you. I
pay 20pp for rezzes atm, but then again if somebody's got a 60% im over the
moon <g>

    Crafts are a very different kettle of fish. A lvl 60 chanter would've
levelled himself to 60 whether he could make cash off KEI or not... I'm not
paying for anybody to level their own character - people have plenty of
motivation to do that on their own. But tradeskills, being almost completely
a separate time investment of their own, fall into a different category.

    And if we're talking about prices and market forces, the simple fact is
that there are chanters who will buff me for 10pp, hence, that is what the
service is worth, at least in that situation.
