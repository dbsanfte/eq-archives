I was playing my level 19 Sk near the windmills getting twinked by my
friend the level 35 cleric. 
you have been hit for 125 (dual) by a Tainted Sturgeon.
I died in perhaps 10 seconds and my friend had to run for the zone and
barely managed to escape with sow on and healing herself.  Someone had
tried the epic for the monk and apparently blew it and the tainted
sturgeon was running around on dry land slaughtering people. 
Yuck.
