Pottery.. Pottery Pottery.. Sniff Sniff.

Working my way up to 250 on Pottery Right now.  Using Stiens as the
logical choice (3rd GM).

I would recommened with these and many other items.. go to your home
city and simply turn in the completed items to the Tribute Master.  I
get about 24 points from an Opal stien.  Better then the 10pp I get in
the bazaar or the 4.5pp from an NPC.

Then use the buffs as you like.  I currently have about 7k in points
doing this.  Im sure that will be useful one of these days.
