Because it IS serverwide, it spans all zones of your server as opposed to
the /auction that only goes in your present zone.

Then VI came along and added the GLOBAL chats and called them serverwide to
add to the confusion... A more fitting name for that would be global or
globalchat so the command would be something like /join globalchat.age:age

But then again I am but a user, what do i know :))
