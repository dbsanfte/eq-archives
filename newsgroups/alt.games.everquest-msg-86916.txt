Yes

Just like Sebilis key.  Everyone needs one.

Yes, and to top it all off you *must* have a rogue, or some incredible luck,
to even have a chance.  Verant, in their infinite idiocy, made it so you
have to fight through three wings (north, west, then south) before you can
zoneout, and *then* made the boss mobs that drop the key to the next wing a
rare spawn, and *then* made the keys to the wings no-rent.

Yeah, Verant encourages "crawling" and discourages camping.  Right...  and
about that bridge.

Two mobs will jump you.  There's a pretty good chance that they are two
harm-touching mobs.  The HS mobs aren't terribly difficult, made up for by
the frequent harm-touches.

Two hints for HS.  1) Don't step on carpets (they are often pit traps), and
2) There are *no* stairs to the east wing, I don't care what your eyes tell
you.  I'll add 3) snare the golems (you'll see them) because they, of
course, run to the east wing (*no stairs!*).
