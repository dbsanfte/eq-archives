If he hadn't hit them yet it's not his mob - he has no claim to it.

No nothing like it at all. If someone is kiting it he has hit it therefore he
has a claim to it.

Now you have a claim to the mob it's a legitimate claim of KS'ing

You died - now you personally have no claim on the mob. Your friend however
does have a claim on the mob but only if your grouped - if not grouped no claim
because he personally hasn't cast on them yet.(see above)

Unfortunately the only thing you can do is retry it - it might suck but that is
your only real option.
