> 
> A:  EverQuest Legends refers to the Stormhammer server, a premium service
> server which costs $40.00 US a month to play on.  The special features of
> this server include Character Pages, which are personal homepages featuring
> all the character's statistics and items.  Also included is a personal
> journal, Legendary Items, Interactive Maps, Guild Halls (a website including
> a guild calendar, message board, member roster, and pages for guild news and
> history), and increased dynamic content and customer service driven by a
> great presence of GM and support staff.

Wasn't this turned into a normal rules server some time ago?
