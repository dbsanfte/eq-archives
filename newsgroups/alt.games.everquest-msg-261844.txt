Cap for Pally is 225 and for Ranger 250,so the difference is 11% and
not  25% ,not to speak of "significantly more".

Not much high 50s Rangers around with 9/22 weapons,not to say
none,when a  12/20 weapon(Razor edged Shan Tok) is around 500p.

So a knight with a WMBS is *NEARLY* as good for damage as a
dual wield class.(in mid level game)
