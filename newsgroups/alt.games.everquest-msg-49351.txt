Keep at it. According to the faction table, the gap between "dubious" and 
"apprehensive" is a lot wider than afterwards to "indifferent" and 
"amiable". Then, you'll be stuck at "amiable" for a long time until 
"kindly".

Otherwise, I've heard that giants in Kael give you much bigger faction hits 
than giants outdoors, you may want to try that.
