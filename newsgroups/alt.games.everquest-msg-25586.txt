But armor class is certainly important! don't forget that. I can stand and take
quite a few hits, not attacking, and still be in control of the group and
healing, thanks to my armor class. It will always take a little extra time for
the tanks to notice your getting hit, then move to protect you. Hopefully your
druid is watching and ready. hopefully the chanter is mezzing him and you have
the comfort of just standing there and not worrying, because you have the ac to
just take hits.
