So, you get that second account and use the main to PL the alt, having the
alt kill and loot the pharming materials for the main if they are too low
for the main to loot.

The RP server sounded like a good idea when they first announced it, and
some people had good ideas for it, but nothing they are implementing really
promotes roleplaying.

EQ isn't a RP game, and I don't roleplay in it, but I feel sorry for those
who planned on going to this server to roleplay.  It will seem nice at
first, until the "newness" of the ruleset wears off and they realize that
nothing was really accomplished to help them roleplay.
