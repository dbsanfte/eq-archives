Ok, this is actually for *any* Warlord out there, but by the sig lines,
Ben's the only one that comes to mind as a regular poster in this group.

Got a couple questions, Ben. Speaking as a bonafide Warlord, throw all
of us wannabe's a bone and tell us:
What's a typical "day in the life" for a Warlord like? I mean, you're
already sixty, so I can't imagine you spend much time "leveling". <g>
Are you in an uberguild that just raids all the time? (I know nothing
about DH since I'm not on Zeb, sorry.)
Do you ever just get in regular hunting groups and grind xp with them?
If you're not raiding 24/7, what are you doing? Working on finding stuff
to upgrade your kit?
Helping guildmates and others to level and catch up?
Or do you play a bunch of alts and just break out the big warlord when
it's time for the guild to raid something tough?

Many of us are still far down the ladder looking up, but having finally
hit a level with a "5" on the front of it, I get to wondering.
