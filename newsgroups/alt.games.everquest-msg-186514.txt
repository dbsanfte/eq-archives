At the cost of nothing.  There will always be creationists.

Personally, I think software evolution is a good thing.  I'd much rather be
doing my work on my existing box than using FORTRAN on an OS/2 1.3 box and
documenting myself with WordPerfect 5.1.

Or playing EQ instead of playing Zork I on my C64.  Not that I didn't love
Zork .....
