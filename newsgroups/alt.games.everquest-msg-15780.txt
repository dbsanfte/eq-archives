The other day I was fooling with my screen chat and tell colors with a
client editor.  Well, I made the settings and went to play the game.
I was sitting in ec tunnel trying to sell some junk and watching a baseball
game on TV.  No offers for anything...sigh...Logged for the night.

Last night I was in game and saw a good friend was on... Sent him a
tell...nothing...sent another thinking maybe he was afk without having afk
on.  After 5 min I sent "HELLO!!!"    This time I noticed a blank line
appear in the midst of all the scrolling auctions...

DOH! "I couldn't have" I thought.

I sent him a tell saying to respond with 3 tells... Sure enough, 3 blank
lines...   I told him I was a dumbass and screwed up my tell colors and went
to fix it.

So...the moral of the story is, "dont set your chat colors to the same as
the background!"

P.S.   If you tried to buy something from an unresponsive Ahole on xev, I
probably still have it.  ;-)
