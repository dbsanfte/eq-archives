Druid is the usual "newbie" soloer class.  Resonably powerfull for 55
levels, can port, usually good faction over most of the world.
Having said that, this is also the reason why a lot of druids get
abandoned at the end game, and why druids have the worst reputation in
the game.
Play your druid till level 30 or so, learn the mechanics and make some
cash.  Then use the cash to twink yourself a necro, shaman or SK,
depending on the degree of solo you want to go.  These three classes
are rather weak to start out, but become great soloers later on.  In
case of shamn and SK you also have group desirablilty in case your
playstile changes.
Necro is very hard at the beginning since you need to not only learn
the game mechanics but also need to learn how to control your pet. 
Plus necros are notoriously short on cash due to their lousy cha and
the tons of spells they have to buy. So you'd be better of to play a
druid for a week to get some cash, and then start with a more fun
class.
