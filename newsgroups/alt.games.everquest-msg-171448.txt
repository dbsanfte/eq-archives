He's still there, but he's a rare triggerred spawn.  You have to kill
all six of his PH's, in the correct order, between the hours of 1am
and 3am on a Tuesday.  This gives approx. a 50% chance that Assist
will spawn at noon the following Thursday (approx. 170 min. real-time
later).  When he spawns you have less than 20 seconds to engage or he
will warp into agro range of the L93 named giants Talldork and
Severedlimb who will promptly kill him and then poof, whereupon the
zone resets.  The zone reset, of course, forces a reconnect of Burned
Woods to a randomly chosen zone, probably in a different expansion (you
did buy all the expansions, didn't you?).
