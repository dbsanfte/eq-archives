I'm honestly not sure who on Rodcet is at the Vindi/HoT stage (which is
where you want to spend some time if you have zero raiding experience).

Get into grind groups.  Grinding at 60 isn't so much different than at 40,
especially as a necromancer.  See who you meet.  The people you grind with
will probably be the people in guilds you might be interested in.

I actually remember grouping with Eros once...  :)
