The people who are leveling faster probably are both playing more hours
per day, and have higher level characters, so they can equip their low level
characters with powerful weapons and armor.  Unless you are trying to keep
up with a friend, try not to worry too much about how quickly someone else
is leveling.  

The same thing happens to me... I meet someone 10 levels below
me, and in a month or two he's a couple of levels above.   I try not 
to worry about it  :)
