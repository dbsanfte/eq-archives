No no no!  Berserker spirit.  And Rune III, if you feel like burning
jaspers.  Seriously.

I was wandering through Field of Bone, and saw a friend of mine on with his
level 18 Iksar monk.  I killed about 15 minutes casting berserker spirit +
sltw on him.  When spirit wore off, I'd cast it again.  In that 15 minutes,
he took almost no damage, and went up two bubbles.

That way, he got to work on his offense/defense skills, too.
