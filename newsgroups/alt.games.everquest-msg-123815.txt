You have to reinstall kunark, velious, and luclin. Luclin only updates
the textures of the older areas IF you let it. I noticed it giving me
way more lag than I even have in luclin zones, so on reinstall I
selected NO to that option. The EQ patcher now limits the amount it
will download to you, so you can't patch up all missing files via it
anymore. 

You will have to install them. For future reference, do like I did if
you have a burner. After deleting all the *.txc (texture cache files)
I burned the entire contents of my EQ dir to about 3 or 4 cdroms pre
luclin. Then I reformatted my hard drive, dumped all the cds into any
DIR, turned off read only in that dir and installed luclin. Since I
had no registry info luclin was well behaved and prompted me for the
dir EQ was in. Now I should back up the whole thing again since I
installed luclin.

You can use up to 2 gig of ram in 98/me or 95 and mostly be fine.
Most other things you hear are old 95 plus myths, usually associated
with hardware limitations.

You only need something like this in your system.ini:

[vcache]
MaxFileCache=96256
MinFileCache=65536

That insures that your vcache can only get so big. Vcache is 
the system memory cache of recently used files which might be used
again. It is helpful for general windows use to a degree, or for the
editing of moderately large graphics files where you jump back and
forth opening them often. For a game like EQ, it doesn't really help
at all and just ties up system memory and memory addresses. The hard
limititation is limiting that to 512 meg, since if your vcache plus
your agp apteture = 850 meg or so or greater, you can run out of mem
addresses and crash. EQ behaves rather badly and will in part cause
the vcache to get huge, so I limit it quite a bit more than 512 meg.
The above setting works great for me in 98 with 576 meg of ram.
I never crash in 98, or in EQ.

Memory rumors about 95 got started because older pentium boards 
could only cache 64 meg of ram at the most. They could recognize more,
but could not cache it. This is where the win 95 64 meg memory limit
got started. A later kind of pentium board could only cache/use
another limit which I've forgotten, perhaps 512 meg. All of these
somehow became the fault of win95, though any OS used on them would
have the same problem. Any pentium 2 board, BX or whatever or above,
can fully use up to 1 gig of ram. My own board is a p2bx 440 about 4
years old, can use up to 1 gig of ram but only can accept 3 256 meg
dimms giving it a hard max of 768 meg ram.

Setting a min/max paging file to a set size seems to help also, to
decrease disk accesses. Mine was set at a max of 650 meg and the  most
I ever used in EQ with all luclin models and LOW textures was 450 or
so meg of it.

>Thanks to anyone who answers this, or even thinks about it.

Cacheman can help with ram management and also is interesting
to use to see how big your page file gets and how big your vcache
can actually get with Everquest.

I ran EQ in 98 with 576 meg ram and now
do in both 98 and XP with 576 meg ram (multibooting)
Both run so well without a hitch that I often forget which
one I'm currently in. I plan to get another 256 meg dimm to 
make it 768 meg ram.
