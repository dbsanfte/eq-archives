  Just because you don't see the GMs disciplining the KSers, doesn't mean
they don't do it.  What action they take against a person is against them
and the person, and they don't, as a policy, share that information with
others.

  As for what good /report is, it's the best proof you're going to be able
to provide.  If you can sucker the KSer/trainer/whoever into admitting what
they've done (you'd be surprised how often they do), you can /report this
easily.

  Granted, none of this does anything for you.  A GM won't spawn a mob or
give you any items that dropped even if they're right there and they witness
it happening.  The logic being, (for example), if a level 6 warrior first
engages the ancient cyclops in South Ro, and somebody KSes him, does he
deserve the ring drop?  My personal opinion is that they should give the
dropped items to the person who was KSed, even when those situations
(rarely) occur, but I can understand the reasons behind their policy.
