It can happen to guilds who are lower level and doing fear for the
first time without the needed people or the knowledge of the zone. 9
hour would actually be good, the worst I've heard is actually losing
corpses. 

The first time I went I spent about 13 hours in a chat room during an
elongated CR. By the time we finally got it I looted my corpse and
said I'm sorry but Im exhausted and just gating out and offered to
port any others feeling the same. 

Now with most of my guild 55 - 60 and being old hands at fear its cake
and any cr is more like minutes rather than hours (if there is even a
cr).

You more or less HAVE to for uber raids. Even if its a good raid and
you are all high level I think it still takes like 2 hours plus to get
up to fear and clear the zone. I've been on tov raids that lasted for
6 hours in the halls of testing where we just kept circling and
redoing it over and over and over ;) Of course often some people just
go for 2 hours then have to leave, it more or less depends on your
guild. 

I'd never belong to a guild that DEMANDED I spent like 8 hours on a
raid. I'd just say "sorry you guys are too uber and dedicated for me,
demand this!" (then make some appropriate emote/gesture) I would not
care even if they were the only uber guild on a server (much more
unusual for that to happen in this day and age)
