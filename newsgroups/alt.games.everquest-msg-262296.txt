Bardbots already exist. Even one song is better than none.

Precisely. And clerics aren't running around crying that bots are 
costing them group invites, costing them slots on raids etc. Nor are 2nd 
box shamen, wizards.. etc killing the game for real shamen, wizards, 
etc...

Even though bard bots will exist, real bards will still be more 
versatile, so the paranoid whining is just silly.

For bards at least, good two boxxing is extraordinarily unlikely.
