Well, I've played both, and I like EQ  alot better.  Mainly because in UO,
the lag was horrendous, and all that ever happend when you try to leave
towns is that people try to PK you.  That gets really annoying.

In EQ there is no PKing, unless you want there to be.

The thing about EQ is in general, its all about sitting at the same spot,
killing something, recovering, killing something... rinse, repeat, ect....
Its fun, but it could also be seen as very boring by some.  In general, 99%
of the people are just in it to level as fast as they can, and make money to
help them level.  I'm definately one of those.

Its a good game, but you'd have to like that sort of thing.
