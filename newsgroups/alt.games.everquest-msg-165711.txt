There are many ways of making camps not a hell-like experience.

The cleric epic solb camp (for old-style rage) used to be many peoples
definition of HELL, but I remember one particular guild who turned it into a
guild "party".  They took most the guild there, old guild members and
friends etc who "played" various games, told jokes, shared stories etc.

How better to pass the time on a shitty camp than to be surrounded with all
your in-game friends?

Like I said, it was a huge exception to stay up sp late for 1 particular
thing, but that is known for being the PITA of camps.   Really, im
struggling to find other examples of mobs/quests/named that require a 12+
hour camp.

Well they can be as long or as short as you want them to be.  Most quests
you can just spend a few hours exping/killing in that zone, log off at your
normal time, log back on at your normal time and carry on.  I'll list
exceptions to that further on, but really, they are the massive exception.

Well, try not to mix the whiners (e.g who started this thread), and genuine
complaints about drop rates.

I'll try to list various camps now.. and if they require 1 mammoth sitting
session or not (which is in no way a full and conclusive list.. add to it at
will)

Haden:  Log on for 10 mins at his due time, you now know when he will next
pop.

Scout (WW benev quest): Ditto for Haden

SSRA Emp key:  Just spend a few hours exping in the right place now and
then.  There is no time whatsoever on the Commander pops, just kill a few
each day/other day until you get lucky.

Vexthal key:  Broken into 12 parts.  10 shards, a frame, and an orb.  Every
luclin mini boss and above drops an orb.  The frame is easy to get.  The
shards - 9 of the 10 can be obtained by just killing them in your normal
schedule.  Only one part of the quest usually involves a long camp (Maidens)
but thats a seriously fucked up camp

Monk epic:  Rasta.  This just sucks.  A long ass camp that should be changed

Coldain rings 1-9: Some (such as the 8th) are fairly highly contested, but
they all have well known pop-times so no huge ass "sit for 15 hour sessions"
are required.

I can't really think of other examples..  but honestly, other than generally
1 shitty camp for your epic, how many people here encounter camps where they
HAVE to sit and wait for 15 hours to have any chance at all with the piece?

Sure some quests suck.. getting bane weapons in Ssra for the emp takes a
long time.. but there is no time on the named popping who drop the piece.
You can exp for 4 hours today and 4 hours tomorrow, and your chances are no
different to somebody who sat for 8 hours killing.

Can't hack the Haden "camp"? (Which is only a camp if you force yourself to
camp it) then go exp in the grey.  Kill some snakes and get an EB necklace
as the reward.

Some quests can take a long long time (e.g mage epic) but your not sat
"camping" PoH for hours and hours on end without being able to take a break.

Anyway im struggling here to think of camps that DEMAND a mammoth length
camp.  Even the 2 I listed above could be done as 4 hour camps over many
days/weeks (reason I listed ME is because on my server at least, its majorly
contested.. so doing 4 hours today, tomorrow, next tuesday etc might not be
possible due to the camps being claimed)

Maybe so, but its a common thought of bigtime players or "uber" guild
members (just look at opinion of furor)

My intentions and expectations?  Well im pretty broad-minded and not much
gets to me.. I see flame wars as cheap entertainment.  I don't mind
participating in them, heck, yeah, sometimes its even fun to.

I don't use a killfile.. its easy to skip over spam and people who's posts
are seriously against my morals (not that anybody here has, the only time I
skip people/threads is on a time basis)

If somebody asks me for help/questions then I will do my best to answer it
(or point them in the right direction.

If somebody is being a greedy whiney fuck, well my reply won't be subtle :)

Im sure its easy to confuse the 2 at times, but thats the price you pay I
guess.  I don't worry too much, I think the people I'd call "friends" here
know when im flaming and when im being serious.

A lot of people seem to have the opinion flaming = trolling.  I think of it
more as flaming = bored mind at work.

Im sure a lot of people use the posts here as a basis for "whats right and
wrong" in EQ (players, not devs).  If whiney dr00d posts went unchallenged
then I think people that didn't know better would get a warped impression of
EQ.

Not everybody here is a regular enough reader to know who is who, and who is
reliable etc.

Just think what some people would think if Hughes made an un-challenged post
that "monks are completly crippled, magicians could outdamage them with
melee!"   Not challenging it seems to imply you have no argument against it,
or you can't disagree etc.
