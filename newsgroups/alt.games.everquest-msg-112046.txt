First off, let's keep in mind that I never said the cleric epic was
"easy" or even "among the easiest". However, the OP is airing his/her
complaints about the ragefire spawn and how it needs to be "fixed". It's
still a damn site easier to get Rage on (apparently) any server except
M-T than it is to get *several* of the drops for the warrior epic. So I
don't agree that it's an issue that "must be addressed". It's an epic.
This is one of the hard bits of the cleric epic. What can I say? Deal.
Cleric epic is a royal PITA. I've helped with a lot of the camps for it,
and none of it's any fun.

And also, since, when you finally joined a guild, you went all out and
joined a seriously fucking uberguild, I see you've very quickly settled
into the uberguild attitude. Try to remember back, oh so long ago, (how
many weeks has it been now?) to the type of equipment that people who
*aren't* in those top 2% guilds are able to get. It's very nice that you
so quickly fell into the "Bah. Who could be bothered with some piece of
shit 14/20 weapon with a 500 pt proc?", but let's keep in mind that what
you have just described is far better than a lot of warlords have. I'm
talking about the warlords who got to 60 in smaller guilds, doing mostly
xp groups and were thrilled if they got a quest armor drop in Kael. Good
friend of mine on Xev, Ceneen by name, has been a Warlord since last
Thanksgiving, roughly. Know what he weilds? Dual Lammies.

The warrior epic certainly isn't required, or even desirable, in your
guild. It would be a massive upgrade to the weapons that any of the
warriors in our guild have. So let's try to jack down the uber 'tude a
notch or two, shall we? You were hanging out with people living with
worse crap than that not too long ago.
