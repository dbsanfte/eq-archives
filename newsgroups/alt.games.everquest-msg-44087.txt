Think key is no drop, but if you want one you could run into Warrens
and spend an hour or so killing stuff until your faction is good
enough to buy one.  I guess you could also have an enchanter/bard
charm the merchant who sells them, then gate out, but that's a bit
risky.  You can squeeze through I think, we have a troll in our guild
who did it, but he's a shammy, so I assume he was pre-shrunk.  Or you
can have someone pick the lock.  I always just squeeze through, but a
bard can pick the lock, so it doesn't take that high a skill.

Nope, in and out at the same spot.  I would recommend learning the
exit well though, since lots of people seem to have problem with
underwater zone lines.  Also, if your swimming skill stinks (i.e. if
you've spent you life on those silly little boats), you probably won't
be able to sucessfully escape from an overpull.  It's not a long swim,
but just enough that if you get stunned a couple times you could be in
trouble.

The are close together, and I know that can be single-pulled, but I
think that requires a high-level puller to do it every time.  I
*think* that you can pull them two at a time though pretty easily, so
it shouldn't be that bad, and you can just root-park the second until
you're ready to deal with them.  I have really only raided there, but
was doing CC in the pre-raid exp group for a while and found them easy
and fast exp at 52 or whatever I was then.  One other time I saw a
group 45-50ish pulling these with a bard as CC and they seemed to have
no problems.  
Oh, and there are only a couple 'no enchanter, no pulling' areas in
the game.  A bard should be able to handle 4 adds, and other than
chardok and breaking the planes I can't think of many places where you
get more than 5 without getting slammed by a train.
Enchanter-schmanter!
