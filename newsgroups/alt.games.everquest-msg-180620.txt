Yes pets can be buffed.  I can't say which ones don't hold on some pets
because I only have a shaman as a pet class but every spell I have tried
(HoS, Focus, Haste, Regen) have held on my doggie.  They even get the
benefit of the buff as far as I can tell, by giving my pet two gnoll hide
lariets(sp) with a proc of stun then giving them dex or focus they seem to
proc a lot more than without the buff.
Also, not really for the benefit of the pet but you can cast buffs on the
pet in order to time when the buff will fade and that way you will know when
to recast a certain buff on the rest of the group (I use this for Haste).
