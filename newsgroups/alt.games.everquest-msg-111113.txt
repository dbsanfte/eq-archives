Oh Brell no, not like that.

Delay count isn't all that hard, and you will probably have
to change it mid fight (as slows land and so forth and you
get things under control, again as Defensive wears off, or
for your SA if you screw up on the MA... SA probably has
lower AC and HP after all.

But if you -did- want to build it in you still wouldn't do it this way.

/pause for whatever length
/1 CHeal to %T next cleric Othercleric_01
/cast cheal
/pause 3
/cast cheal

would be infininately better, as it would give a clear
trigger point for the next cleric to start his heal count on
his own timer, instead of relying on your timing trigger
complete with lag.

Another problem with either method is that that pause
time prevent the cleric next in rotation from doing
anything with his time... Divine Light, Remedy,
even Celestial or (crazy as it sounds) Complete Heal
may fit comfortably inside that free time, but with
your autopause you prevent that cast, be it a buffer
for a sudden jump in the MA HP loss, or a side
heal to a damaged chanter or rogue who got momentary
aggro or any party members under a whithering AOE
barrage.
