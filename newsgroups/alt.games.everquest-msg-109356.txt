Sure, they're CRPGs.

They don't have any "role-acting" which is what a lot of people tend
to think of as "roleplaying." But roleplaying is a broad term that has
come to mean several different things:

- living through a story with an alternate identity
- merely having an alternate identity
- acting as if you were actually that alternate identity
- building up statistics that mathematically represent an alternate
identity

MMORPGs happen to do all of those to an extent, but in larger-scale
games is gets to be very hard to do the sort of collaborative
role-acting that hardcore RPers crave. That's what the Law is
addressing.
