My bard is only level 30 right now but Im having a blast, bards are the most

other goodies, if you want to solo you can Charm, fear/snare or Chant kite.

Do they go on raids a lot? I remember with my wizard that I

Groups like you, good races like you, and if you get the masks and some
faction work everybody will like you, so I'd say you're set. Now, I've only
been mentioning all the good things, of course there are also some bad
sides. We don't have too many HP's so tanking is unpleasant, also, bards
aggro the shit outta critters, but with some skill you can manage that. Hope
that helped,
