Howdy and Hail, lords and ladies.

I've just got a few qucik questions that i hope someone can knock out of my
head for me.

1)I play on Tholuxe, in the Qeynos/Surefall/Halas region, and was wondering if
there's any monster or even an npc that drops/sells a passable 1h slash magic
weapon. I vaguely remember seeing a "Velium Long Sword" on a vendor in Halas
once, but can't for the life of me track them down again.
I'm tired of having a little power under my belt(level 14 warrior, and going
strong), but not having the blades to back up my skill.

2)I have a shaman char in the same area i'm using to help a friend level up so
he can hunt with my main, and have his first two levels of spells, but am
missing two spells from each level. I've looked at the vendors in my guild over
and over, and can't seem to fill in these annoying gaps. Are there quests i
have to perform to obtain these spells? Or perhaps certain items i have to
gather and combine somehow?

3)What's the next armor up from banded? I've heard that bronze is probably best
for me, but i've only got 98 str with my magic gorget, and have heard that the
bronze stuff is WAY heavy. Is there any item that gives a good str bonus that
can be found in my area? Or will i have to journey to the East Commons, so
called marketplace of EQ??

4)What spell is generally used for "porting", and who gets it? This is more
curiousity than anything, as i find magic rather dull in practice, if flashy in
a visual sense.

5)Is there any good way to raise blacksmithing at low levels? 
I'm stuck at 25 skill, and using the eq.stratics and eqtraders methods and
recipes, i get the "trivial" message for everything they say i should be
making, and i fail miserably at the stuff i'm not supposed to be able to yet.
I don't really have the monetary resources for the skill at the moment, but
since playing Ultima Online, smithing has been an skill that peaks and holds my
interest.

Thanks to any and all who take the time to answer my questions.
