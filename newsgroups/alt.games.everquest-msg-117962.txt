I have macros set-up. They go something like this:  Line 1=
/stopsong    Line 2 = /pause 10 (this varies you will need to find
what works for your connection)   Line 3 = /cast 1.  I have had
these for a long time so I may not have it exactly right, but you
can figure it out from there.

I have one bank set-up with buttons 1 - 8   working songs 1 - 8.
Button 9 is my SS boots (lev for travel).  Button 10 sense heading
(again for travel).  Different banks are set-up in different ways.
One for solo, one for being mele in group, one for all instrument
attack and one for raids.  That isn't exactly right, but it gives
the general idea.

FWIW I have a cable connection and a ping of under 100 and I very
rarely get 4 songs going constant.  But I have found that in MOST
situations 4 songs isn't going to help anyway.  If you have a
chanter and a shaman in your group 3 songs is really all you need to
keep going so they have things to do.  Don't want them to get too
bored  =).
