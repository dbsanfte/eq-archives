There are sometimes instances in which your corpse will not be visible
to you. Usually, though, either zoning or re-logging takes care of it.
If ever you find that you have something like this occur, one of the
first things you should do is /petition the GM's. They can determine if
it's at least in a wall or not. What it sounds like, though, is that
somehow your husband's corpse ended up at the "safe point" in the zone.
If he still can't see it, though, have him consent you and then you
should drag his corpse a couple feet to see if that makes it visible to
him. By the way, what you are paying (assuming you have two accounts)
amounts to about $0.64 US per day. So, if your husband is getting upset
over paying $0.64 US per day, perhaps you should not be playing the
game. Either way, show me something that costs less per day, and is less
frustrating. Maybe then I could be more sympathetic to your husband's
short-sighted complaints.
