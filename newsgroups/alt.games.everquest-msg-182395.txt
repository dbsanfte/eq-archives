When I still wet behind the ears and in West Commons I remember running into
a werewolf and fled for my life to the nearest zone!  I had never seen one
before and it looked and sounded extra-scary!

Sometime later a chanter turned the puller into a werewolf and when he came
back with the pull, I almost fell out of my chair to see the
incarnate-of-evil staring at me!!

All I do is laugh about it now cause I was frantically trying to target and
kill our puller...lol.
