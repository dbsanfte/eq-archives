I was using a Celeron, 400Mhz
512M memory
Radeon 64
native sound
I was functional, but slow.


Just got a for less than $800
P4 2.4G
1Gig Memory
Radeon Pro 9000
Now I am happy with the detail and speed.

Upgraded the wife's machine and found that the video card makes a LOT
of difference. She went from a TnT 32 to a Rad 9000 Pro, and her
1.2Ghz now runs nice.

Moral is go for best Video first, faster memory, and processor speed
second.
