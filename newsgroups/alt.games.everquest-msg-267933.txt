Heroic opportunities are nice.  They make it  so combat is involving 
instead of the "hit attack and watch tv until dead" feature of EQ 1. I 
have been in many battles over the last 20 levels, both group and 
solo, where the heroic opportunities have saved the day.  The trick is 
learning how they work in groups.  Once you get a group that have them 
pegged your kill rate increases dramatically.

Tradeskills on the other hand are tedious and overly time consuming 
IMO.  They really could have done a much better job on them.
