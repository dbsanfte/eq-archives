On the off chance this person is only ignorant and not stupid, I will give
the "nice" answer.

Everquest is an ONLINE only game. If I were to zip my entire EQ directory
and post it, or heck, even just hand you my disks, you could install the
game, but you COULD NOT PLAY IT.

EQ has an activation code with each piece of software, you use this to prove
you bought the game. That number is good ONLY ONCE. So, once again, if I
were to give you my activation codes and software you COULD NOT PLAY IT.

If someone was stupid enough to give you the software, their activation
codes, AND their username and password to the account THEY paid for, you
could play the game... until their payment plan ran out(usually 30 days).
and then once again, you would have to PAY to play online.

Dang, that was nice of me <pats self on back>
