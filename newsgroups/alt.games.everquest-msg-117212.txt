For me one of the great beauties of this game is that certain milestones
will bring back that same (or very similar) sense.  I was one proud Dwarf
pup to have found my way out to Butcherblock, and immedeatly set-to on the
first skeleton I saw. Right afterwards i did my very first corpse
run...about 50 yards away.  A couple of bats proved to be more to my
challenge, and after coming back to the haven the guards provided I sat down
to regain some lost health. I hear a voice ring out across the land "Dwarf
Check!" , and I very happily replied with "Valkir level 1 Warrior here!"  To
this day I still wonder what caused all of the 'LOL's afterward )

Started a Dwarf Cleric as well.  Once again, in Butcherblock, I saw a fellow
Dwarf with axe in hand slowly walking away from a large skeleton that was
harrying her.  Seeing her life was so low, I stopped to cast heal spells
upon her to at least aid in her escape. Alas, it did no good, and she
succumbed to the onslaught.  Then the skeleton turns to me and says "LOL!
You tried to HEAL her??". I knew i was dealing with the worst kind of
sentient undead, so I dropped my largest damaging spell upon it!  The
creature acted as if it never even felt it.  So I took the next best course
of action and fled to the nearest guard, then beat-feet back to Kaladim, in
case the skeleton gave chase.

I remember the overwhelming anxiety of watching orcs running at me through
the mists of Greater Faydark.
I remember running blindly through dark forests and stumbling onto a village
of very angry brownies (never saw that corpse again).
I remember the first time seeing giants in the Oasis of Marr, and almost
crying in anguish when I first encountered 'ghoul-root'.
I remember looking into a well in Befallen, and actually finding the
concealed door on the 4th floor before 'ghoul-root' took me again.
I remember sending a tell to someone looking for a great piercing weapon
that I would sell him my Fine Steel Spear. (Why did he LOL?)
I remember being the lowest level person in the Great Divide, at 34th.
And i remember gaining 45th Level, and just an hour later being given a tell
to come on a Nagafen Raid.

There are so many places I have never even set foot in. I hope to know that
wonder-eyed sense many more times in the days to come.
