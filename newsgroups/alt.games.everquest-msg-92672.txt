I am a level 26 Bard....and I hacked and slashed my way there.  I
would like to learn more about twisting songs, as I usually group with
many melee, they don't need the few blows that I get.

I was wondering if there is a way to twist songs with different
instruments.  Is there an easy way to switch instruments??  The only
way I know is to call up the inventory screen and mouse around to
change instruments...easily a 5-7 second job..which does not allow
much for twisting songs while doing it.  Is there a faster way
utilizing hot keys some how?

Thanks
