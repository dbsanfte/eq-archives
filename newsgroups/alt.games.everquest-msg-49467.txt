     I could easily see myself getting too into EQ,
so I do take occasional days off.  One or two, 
here or there.  I kinda make it a point to not 
play on Fridays, since I get off work at 7pm and
have to be back at 5:30am Sat.  I could play for
a couple of hours, of course, but I find it 
refreshing to have a "time out" day.
    I should point out that since I live in San
Diego, and my husband lives in Washington state,
the only time I "see" him, except for when he's 
on leave, is when we play EQ together.  Ok, 
its not a perfect substitute.  We can't have
sex, of course (I don't count typing at a sexual
act), but we can dine together, visit different 
cities, and run around and kill things just like
in real life.
   Should also be noted, I never had a real life,
and never will.
