me too, I hit level 40 Friday night and Sunday afternoon I was level 41 :)
I took the cougars to level 39 or 40, then a nice spot for dire wolves is
along the north ridge of the island with the great span.  remember no loot
on the wolves so make you plat elsewhere.  I'll probably stay here until
level 42 then head over to CC for a new belt, then stay in GD a re-work on
my group skills (been soloing for over 10 levels) until 45, then quad-kite
my way outta hell.  Now is also when you want to be working on getting your
WIS gear.  Soloing HG's is the way to go if you have the mana.
