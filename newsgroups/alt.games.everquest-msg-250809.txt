No, there was a heavy nerf, just like the Grey was nerfed shorly after
Luclin came out. The zem was newbie zone 130 on release. It was dropped
to 60, then at some point restored to 75. That's direct from both zem
charts I've seen posted and direct experience. I leveled an alt warrior
in LoIO in early Kunark days and could see the exp bar move. I think I
got 5 levels over a weekend. I never went back until I moved to a new
server after quitting for 5 months, and by then, mid velious era, while
leveling a new character, I went there and it was painfully slow, and
the zone population reflected it.
