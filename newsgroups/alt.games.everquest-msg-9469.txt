I would suggest only using large races such as Trolls Ogres and Barbarians
for Warriors, they have superior stats and dont look stupid like halfling
warriors. Iksar Warriors are very cool due to thier regen and ac bonus and
once you get to plane lvls you'll have no trouble getting a complete set due
to the fact that thier will be no competition for the Legionaire pieces that
you desire. Just remember that Str and Sta are the only real important stats
for a tank. Dex and Agi should be kept around 95 or 100 but dont worry bout
getting it any higher than that. The str cap is around 250 and the stamina
cap Iam unsure off. You really cant go wrong with a warrior if you pick a
large race or an iksar. Good luck and have fun its a great class.
