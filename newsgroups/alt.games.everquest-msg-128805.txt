wrong... your senseless pride is depriving you of reason.
evidence - how many times have you seen the Palestinian death toll (1000+)?
none.  and the Isreali death toll (about 100)?  numerous times.
how was the coverage of the areas devastated by Isreali attacks?  close to
nothing.  Body count was totally absent.

i listed a direct link to an article in a reply to one of your other posts.
there are numerous articles... have fun reading.

isreal would continue the oppression of the palestinian people...

if isreal stopped that oppression... the suicide bombings would stop...
Palestinians could start developing their state.

if Bush was truely neutral... negotiations about disputed lands could
resume.  unfortunately, he's pro-isreal.
evidence - how many times has bush met with sharon in person?  6+.
how many times has he met with Arafat in person?  0.
and that's all in 1 year!
