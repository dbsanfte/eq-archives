Off the top of my head I have:

Springwood Club
Charred Guardian Shield
Shroud of Nature
Platinum Jasper Rings
Platinum Ruby Veil
Batfang Headband
Chipped Bone Bracelet
Kobold Hide Boots

All purchased from the bazaar. But I reckon all the really good stuff
is nodrop. Aptly named as i've never seen any of it drop :)

Can't remember the rest... I have 192 wisdom, mana preservation 2,
affliction efficiency 2, extended affliction 2, extended enhancement
2.

It's not that I don't have decent gear, it's just that mobs hardly
ever drop any magic items, and when they do they are crap for their
level. It's always a great excitement looting a monster and finding a
really great item on it. That hasn't happened in the 5 months that
i've been playing and it's kind of a letdown. Monsters are nothing
more than money containers. I shouldn't have to wait till i'm level 55
or whatever before items start to drop.
