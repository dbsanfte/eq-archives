  Eh, I don't really buy that.  A melee isn't very strong in combat
without their gear (monks perhaps being the exception) and most of the
caster classes have spells which assist in CRs.  Some of these spells,
later on, are shared by hybrids, while rogues have a distinct
advantage with their hide/sneak abilities and monks with FD... but
overall, many caster classes are very well suited to doing CRs and in
many cases can perform CRs that would basically be impossible for a
melee class.  Invisibility spells, movement buffs, illusions, roots,
snares, pets, Gate, temporary invulnerability spells and damage
absorbing spells all may be of great assistance in safely performing a
CR.

  I have played primarily casters in my time in EQ, and never have
thought I had it particularly hard when it comes to CRs.  The only
times I've really had much trouble was those times I died in zones I
was unfamiliar with.  So I don't really feel that casters need a
special handicap for CRs over melee classes.
