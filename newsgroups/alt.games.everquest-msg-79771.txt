How does the grouping work with exp and other levs in group.  Such
as.......a lev 25 grouping witha 30....and so on........What are the
limits of getting exp with groups?  Is there a website that shows this?

What types of rezzes are there and  what do each do?   Or a website that
tells this info.



Any suggestions on better gear?
