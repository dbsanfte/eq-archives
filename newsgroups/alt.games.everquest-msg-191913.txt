Crashing is one of OE's major problems. There are far more stable
newsreaders out there, and those that are easier to use and don't need
to be user-configured away from non net-friendly default settings.

Also, the list made no mention of user-end ability to choose not to
view messages in HTML. It also makes no mention of the default
top-post habit of OE.
