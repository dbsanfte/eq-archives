I'm confused... you can think of a better type of file to store text in?

It's not like they ever need to underline or boldface anything.  Text 
files are small.  I wish more people would use text files... Especially 
since, given that I don't see any of those files in my EQ directory, it's 
a safe bet they've compressed them all, making them smaller still.  
Shorter patching! yay.
