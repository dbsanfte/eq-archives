Another problem I'm affraid.

Since installing Luclin I am unable to play with the sound card
installed. I have DX8.1 (W2K) and all the most recent sound and vid
drivers from the manufacturers sites. The system locks up during the
load process after the server selection screen.

I have 2 modems, one PCI and one is USB. When connecting with the USB
modem the PC just locks up, when using the PCI I get a IRQ message and
an error in ntoskernel.exe; blue screen.

With modem drivers uninstalled EQ runs ok, if a bit choppy (need to
upgrade memory and graphics). It seems like a hardware conflict but
this only happens in EQ. I have tried reinstalling the card in another
PCI sot, but it didn't help. DXDIAG checks out ok.

How do I reassign IRQ's in Win2K? Alternative suggestions as to what
the problem is would be greatly appreciated. Anyone else with a
similar set up having problems?

System.
