Oh man did I call it!

Got to the log in screen... and my login name isn't there.  Its been 5 
months since I was last on, more like 2 years since I last actually 
entered my login name, I can't remember what the hecate it was!

I remember the password, mind you, because I spent 9 months a year 
typing that password in an average of twice a day.  But the login name? 
  That just sits there, no problem... and no reminder.

They apparantly changed the login screen as part of an upgrade while I 
was gone, and blanked out the information on it for me.

No problem, they have a link to the Sony web site where I can get the 
information.  Lets see here, all I need is the email address I set up 
the account with... oh, like I haven't changed email addresses about 
five times in the past couple years.  Well, I run thru them all till I 
find the right one, fortunately I happen to have entered the truth on 
their other question so thats no problem.  After a few false tries, I've 
got it... so they send the information to that email address.  You know, 
the one I haven't had in two years, in fact that ISP is no longer in 
business!

Course by now its too late to contact anyone at SOE in person... so this 
little glitch has me still offline till at least tomorrow.

Hmm, checking my bank account.  Yep, they've been sucking the cash out 
like clockwork... but no luck, it doesn't say for which account!

Bah, tomorrow it is I suppose... and if I can't get the info out of them 
I suppose its cancel the account, its bad enough they've been sucking 
the cash out when I haven't been using it due to my real life, but if I 
can't get back in at all, well, thats further than even I'm willing to go!

(I think I'll throw a few dozen attempts at likely names at that space 
and see how it goes... heck if I can't find my account, maybe someone 
else is using the same PW as me!)
