It really depends on you.  My first character was a warrior for the same
reason you mentioned but I found it boring.  Then I tried a caster and found
out that - after learning how to memorize the spells <easy enough> - it was
easier than being a warrior.

Good EQ sites:
www.allakhazam.com (if you don't mind pop-ups)
http://eq.castersrealm.com
www.eqatlas.com (maps, obviously :) )

At least the first two have lots of links to other EQ sites.

Have fun!  Remember to play responsibly.
