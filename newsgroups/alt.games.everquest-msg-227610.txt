Compaq has a very nasty history of using proprietary technology . I.E. parts
that cannot be upgraded or replaced at fair market value. This means in
effect that it is economically inadvisable to ever fix or upgrade a compaq
machine. Since most people dont know how to fix or upgrade a machine in the
first place, and tend to buy completely new computers every few years this
is not nearly the problem it used to be.

Dell used to be the gold standard for reliable technology and customer
friendly service (second place going to IBM ) They have engaged in a
proactive market share war for the last couple of years . Customer service
is not nearly what it used to be and there parts are no longer completely
reliable.

I hope you get good value for what you paid but I would have never bought
either one :) Did your dvdr come with a nice movie copying software bundled?
