So who among us are currently playing on Firiona Vie; not "I have
a character there I haven't touched in a year" but "I play there
every couple days, or at least I would if I had some people to
pal around with"

I've got Splendid, 30 Gnomage
There's Teapray, 44 Milk medic
Lentea, 28 ogre tamer
Koscha, 17 Lizard monkey
Kreskin, 10 Milk chanter

Auxiliaries (people we pal around with that aren't also on AGE)
Lenny, 44 ogre basher
Rzantha, 17 lion tamer

Anyone else?  Thats not quite a guild worth of people, but I
don't think any of those are currently guilded.  Guild or no
guild, it would still be fun to get everyone on my friends list
for possible grouping

Splendid One
