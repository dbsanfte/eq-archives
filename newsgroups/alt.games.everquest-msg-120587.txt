OK, I logged on briefly before the patch to check out
my gear for focus effects.  Only item my cleric has
is Supple Scale Armband, with Improved Range III.

I checked this out by selecting a stationary target, backing
and cast/duck cancelling till I got an out of range message,
then put on the armband and was able to cast.

Then I went over to my bard to look around.  One
item he has is an Enshrouded Veil, with the new
focus effect Summoning Efficiency III; absolutely
useless to a bard, of course, and he hasn't been
wearing it recently anyway, so I'll have to find
someone who needs it or sell it sometime.

At any rate, the other Focus item he has is Azure
Sleeves, which now have Improved Damage I

Funny thing is, as a bard he uses low level songs
a lot, his only DD is level 12, Bellow.  Engaged
a skeleton, without sleeves on doing 16 damage
per tic.  With sleeves on.... still 16 damage per tic.
Amplified, 24 damage per tic, with sleeves on...
still 24 damage per tic.

Is the Improved Damage item:
1) Broken
2) Doesn't work for bards, only real casters
3) Works only for the bard songs that spend mana
4) Works only occaisionally (as I understand the
Reagent Conservation ones do)
5) such a small improvement that it doesn't show
over 16 or 24 points as a single point gain?  10% would
be either one or two points for 16, and two or three points
for 24...
