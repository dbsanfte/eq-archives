My guild was getting them constantly in ToV last night.  I'm not going
to say that nobody would be using bind wounds in ToV, but I suspect
that it's a rarely used skill in that zone.  We were getting 1 to 8
lines of gibberish at a time, then started getting waves of LD.  The
zone went from 130 to 70 in about 2 minuted, and we had at least a
dozen who couldn't get back in.  The guild doing pulling the north
wing had similar problems.  Of course we figured it will take 2-3
months before SOE finds and patches the problem.
On the other hand, one of our clerics now has the Ale symbol, so I was
well stocked with whistle-wetters the entire time.  Rez effects are
much more bearable with about 20 Brell's Blessed Stouts in your belly.
