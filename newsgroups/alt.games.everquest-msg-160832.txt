That's exactly the way I am with my 60 mage - I have 4 slots
that are summoned focus items.  Only 20hp/mana on each, but
the benefits (IMO) outweigh the costs.  I only have 202 int
un buffed, and around 310ish +mana.  I just can't see losing
the efficiency on my nukes, the speed on all spells, and the
duration increase on my buffs for the ~6mana/int I'd get for
int items in those slots.
