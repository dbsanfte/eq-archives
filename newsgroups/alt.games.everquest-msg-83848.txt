I have the same on my Athlon 1.4ghz, 256mb DDR ram and a GF2 ultra
64mb graphic card.

Game totatly stops for up to 10 seconds while it goes crazy on my
harddrive, did a quest in shadowhaven last night delivering stuff to
the bazaar but the game was so choppy i gave up, not as bad in the old
world but even there it can be nasty from time to time, not fun during
a fight to get one of the lockups for 5 seconds :(
