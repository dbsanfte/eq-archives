Only 24 people can get keys, and only then as long as no
one is stupid and despawns the key mob.  (We had one PoA
newbie despawn the key mob after two keys once...)

For raids bigger than 24, you leave the group leader on
the island where you just got keys, necro and rest of raid
goes to next island's safe spot, everyone else attacks the
key mob (Sirran?) and dies, wizard ports them back in,
group leader invites them back into group, necro targets
as in CotH, summons corpse, cleric rezzes.

It's CotH with coffins and corpses, in general.  The only
problem is making the corpses and getting people back into
the zone to have their corpse summoned.  Dying is pretty
easy, of course, and getting people back into the zone isn't
an issue as long as you're willing to spend the money for
the ports.  Just keep everyone bound in the same zone, usually
Nexus or Nek.

One player in my guild has a 46 cleric and his necro camped
on the 7th island.  Both sign in, necro DoTs himself, dies,
appears at his bind spot in Nek, gets ported up to PoA with
a raid, group leader stays on island one, his cleric rezzes
the necro back to the 7th island, everyone in raid commits
suicide on the key mobs, gets ported back, gets invited to
group, necro summons to 7th island, and clerics rez.   Instant
7th island raid without ever getting a key and it costs just
two ports.  That's a lot easier and faster than fighting all
the way through when your guild wants a few mage epics and
it's relatively painless, especially when the summon is
coffinless and manaless...
