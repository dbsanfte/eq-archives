It is Fear, don't practice it during combat unless the mob is snared
and your party knows it is going on. I have practided it and get
skillups by spamming it while running. I used to skill up in it while
on a boat, by fearing the boat. The boat never runs away either.

It required you to kick the mob, and it is the only kick you get. At
the end of intimidation, if you suceed, you kick the mob. If the kick
lands, you intimidate it. It is then feared. I use it when I am duoed
with a snare class, and often we are both fearing the mob.

You can solo well, if you intimidate after snaring with a crystylinne
net, or a Dark edged dagger. It works like fear kiting, you kep the
mob feared, while BSing and smacking it's back.

When your HHK group is taking a med break, or when you are waiting for
a group, spam the intimidation skill on a far away mob. You will get
raises pretty quickly if you practice a lot.
