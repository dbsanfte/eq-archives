Good grief man, do you live to argue? or argue to live?  Has it
never occured to you that not only does the world not revolve
around you, but maybe, just maybe, it's not supposed to?

EQ is a game, not a pacemaker, not a critical avionics system
for a jetliner, not a program to put a woman on Mars (I do have
a sister-in-law I'd like to voluteer to be first for that), not
even a piece of accounting software.  There is no money to be
made in the flawless design, development, or maintainance of an
MMORPG, nobody's gonna pay for it, it would be a recipe for
financial disaster.  Your expectations are beyond unreasonable.
