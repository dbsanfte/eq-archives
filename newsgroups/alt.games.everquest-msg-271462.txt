You generally seem pretty bright, but this time, either my joke went
right over your head, or you're an offended Christian.  I'll assume
the former, and explain.

In a nutshell, the exceedingly stupid Flash movie bizbee linked to was
of a ranting, small, obnoxious, potty mouthed thing trashing people
who don't share his/her/its opinion (no wonder bizbee liked it).

The rant seemed to trash people who believe in things like, oh, the
separation of church and state.  No, I don't particularly like it when
my tax dollars fund public schools which turn around and push religion
on children in the form of having children construct nativity scenes
and sing religious songs.

My joke was an attempt to show how the separation of church and state
actually is a good thing, otherwise, some day, some public school
teacher might think it's perfectly okay for them to push *their*
favored religion on people, which might be based on worshipping Satan,
or something else equally toxic.

Do you get it now?  I apologize if it wasn't funny/obvious enough for
you.

Since it was all a joke, and I've written no such song(s), of course I
can't give it away, Einstein.

Hmmm, maybe you *are* just an offended Christian.  If so...good.

Sorry, but anyone who agrees with, or finds any fundamental truth to
what that stupid Flash movie says, is just a fucking moron.  The
separation of church and state is a good thing, not a bad thing.
