You do.  But Verant owns the items and account, and you
don't have the right to sell them or sell access to them.

Just how many times will this have to be explained to you
until it sinks in?

If you want to sell your time, go get a job.

So far so good, because Verant allows you to do that kind of
activity with the Everquest bit-patterns on *THEIR* servers.

WRONG, because you agreed not to engage in such behavior every time
you got on to play.

That's what it really comes down to -- Verant gave you the opportunity
to play on their servers if you agreed to abide by certain rules.
You did agree, you did play, and now you want to weasel and whine
and lawyer your way around to find a way not to have to abide by
YOUR promise not to sell in-game items or accounts.

You're acting like a spoiled child, and it's not pretty.

You agreed to the rules, now follow them, or move on and leave
Everquest and your accounts behind.

But stop the crybaby "I don't hafta!" nonsense, will you?  It
gets old *really* fast.

Your EULA promise does not become any less binding just
because you were crossing your fingers when you clicked "accept".
Be a man and stop trying to do what you agreed you
would not do.  Anything else is the behavior of a dishonest brat.
