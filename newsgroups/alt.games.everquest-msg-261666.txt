Your logic is lacking; if you get a minimum of one point of faction per 
kill, and can never move your faction upwards by more than 3500 points, 
then you'll never have to kill 7000 mobs, at most you'll have to take 
down 3500.

+/- 3500 means you can never raise it more than 3500 or lower it by more 
than 3500.  Its possible for you to drop it 3500 points first, then 
raise it 7000, I think, since I believe that designates a divergence 
from your original start... but that wouldn't be from your start 
position, you'd have to first spend some effort really really alienating 
the FV folks.

If you start at -3500 then doing so will take you to 0, which I think is 
indifferent but heck, might be dubious for all I know, its a long time 
since I saw actual numbers.

If 42 is correct and the maximum divergence is +/-2000 then its just 
2000 hits, at 100 an hour thats 20 hours... which would still be a week 
for most players, but not weeks or months.

Or one day for the way some people play, although its hard to imagine 
anyone being that driven just to faction.
