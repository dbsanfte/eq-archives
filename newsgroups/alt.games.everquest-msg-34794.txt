Herein lies the problem...a burst of bad energy from someone in the NG. When
does the mob stop with the one liners considering he hasn't kept up the
fight? They don't...they keep bashing away like the little kids they are and
anyone that steps forward and tells them that that is enough receives the
same treatment just for saying so. This has snowballed from the original
arguement into a bunch of adolescent name calling from the mob that jumped
on him for calling people names in the first place. See the irony? The same
people that got pissed that he called someone a bad word...are now using the
same tactics against a person that told em to knock it off. Albeit they may
not be using the word "fuck", but calling someone an
idiot...stupid...moron...etc is just as bad IMHO. Same flame...different
fuel.

How am I not having a "relevant position" in the discussion? Oh that's
right...I'm standing up for someone that's NOT in the lynch mob...so I
deserver the same treatment as him. Whatever...you people are the biggest
bunch of hypocrits...and are blind to your own misdoings.
