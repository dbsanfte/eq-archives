For the life of me, I can't visualize this.  Heh - don't suppose you have a
digital camera handy...  I've been in a lot of IBM, Dell, Gateway machines over
the years...

So.. the 'thingy' that the monitor plugs into in the IBM - that's a card, right?
When you hold your new AGP super-duper card next to it, do they even look
related?  Do the slots line up?

Is the monitor out on a different edge in the IBM?!?

Better yet (and I'm sure you've done this before...) want to post the model
number(s) of your machine (most likely again)?  I'd cheerfully go look it up. 
I'm quite curious.

Dunno.  I could see you have the video on the motherboard in the IBM - that
wouldn't be all that unusual.  But a 'weird' card just sounds... err... 'weird'!
