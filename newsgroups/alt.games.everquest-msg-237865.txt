try this...  time is a matter of degree, the closer you look the more 
you perceive it, if you operate on the scale of the universe then 
everything is one big moment, everything is happening all at once so its 
not a matter of preordainment, it just that everything has already 
happened and its not that someone or something has decided your destiny, 
its that what you have decided helps make up the universe.  You and the 
universe are one and the same... magic. <fizzle> <fizzle> fizzle>
