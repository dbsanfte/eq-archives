Well I'm not sure I really get what you're saying but I don't deny that 
different people are going to have different reactions to the game, that's 
pretty expected behavior. And since I'm one of those who liked CoH, I guess 
there's something to what you say (at least in terms of mechanics, certainly 
not even close in terms of content).

By the way, that auto-facing you're talking about is dumb, I hate it too. 
Fortunately, it's one of a half-bazillion options that you can control 
completely in Options. I turned it off right away.
