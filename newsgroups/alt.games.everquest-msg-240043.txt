Well dark, Id disagree... I personally think he was speaking to the
Emar people to start a thread over here.  Welcome peeps, would be
directed to the mass of people coming here for the first time..

If its hard to see... well think... why the hell would he be welcoming
us to our house?  He Wasn't... or of course I am wrong...  been there
done that before.

and if you would take a few deep breaths, this "spokesperson" has been
rather civil considering the condescending attitude he has received.
But you know thick skin and all ... its usenet, no need for us to have
manners, patience, self respect....

By the way, Dark and Bizbee both do post useful information... they
can be helpful as well.  They also can be quite full of venom and
waiting to pump it into a victim... new or old.
