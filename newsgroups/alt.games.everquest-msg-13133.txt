: You probably are. Does the word "root" mean anything to you? Always

: them the same courtesy they show you, which sounds like zero.

I have run into this numerous times and can only say, if the mob seems
to be acting strangly take a second look. Sometimes a stationary mob
-looks- like it is full health, but get up close, after a few seconds
the health bar falls rapidly.

Usually if I engage a parked mob and a druid runs up and says its theirs
I'll back off and see what it does, if it comes after me I won't take a
beating.

Sometimes I have a problem -where- a druid parks a mob. I don't know if
it is first time druids in FM, but you will often see giants parked in the
valley leading to the LOIO, where people are running, sometimes badly
wounded to the zone. This is also the place where giants will stand
around if they have chased someone out of the zone, it is impossible
to tell the difference, and I don't like loosing health to find out.
