It's fake you noobs!

The gear is obviously faked. A L55 warrior couldn't even taunt the mobs
they drop off. If that wasn't enough, the starred Yttrium ring is the
giveaway. Drops of Lord Seru, FoH has the only known one in existance,
and if you think an FT5 all/all ring would go to a L55 warrior, I've got
a bridge I could sell you for a good price...
