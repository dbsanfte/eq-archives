SoE is a huge company, running multiple games.  I would have to think 
that as they add more servers, etc they are getting a better deal on the 
overall bandwidth that they need to purchase.  Furthermore, specifically 
to EQLive, I can't imagine they are actually investing MORE money in it 
now than they did before.

I don't think anyone who is questioning/decrying the price increase is 
trying to say its too much money or that it's breaking the bank.  The 
problem people have is "hey, what is that extra $2 doing for me?".  The 
obvious answer is that it's not doing anything for any EQLive customers.  
Service is the lightest its been in ages (I remember years ago when 
guides and GM's were commonplace) and if I had to guess, I would say that 
your extra $$ is just going to fund/subsidize other SoE projects.
