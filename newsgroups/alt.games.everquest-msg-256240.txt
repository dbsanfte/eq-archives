Oh, it's definitely a short cut alright. One of my favorite ones.

In my opinion the low end game is the most fun. Plenty of places to
go, lots of very scary places to have to move through. Being
under-equipped isn't a disastrous problem. etc.. Lots o' fun.

However that being said, if you are looking to speed up your
progression a little, I wouldn't wory about your skills much.

I just PLed a warrior from level 1 to level 47. Well, not quite true,
he's been an equal member of the group for the last 3 or 4 levels.
However, all your important skills as a warrior go up with use, and
you will be using them constantly. My warrior had no problem maxing
all his important skills. The only important skill that is not maxed
is defense, and right now it is 3 points less than max. (It has gone
up incredibly slow since 200, I put it down to fighting only slowed
mobs since 40) Other than that, my 2HS, 2HB, Kick, and Archery are all
about 50. That's not because I could not have gotten them up while
focusing on the other skills, but rather that I just have had no
desire to do so. Archery is not really useful to a warrior, because
when pulling with a bow, actually hitting the target isn't all that
important, (though I can see the use of doing some damage on the
incoming) and I use my incite line for pulling anyway as it gives me
really good agro. I'm a large race, so kick is fairly useless to me,
and I don't intend to use a two handed weapon. I'd rather dual wield,
or use a shield. (Though people posing about the disc that makes you
riposte everything, makes me reconsider.)

You should have no problem keeping all your skills maxed. My warrior
was going up more than 5 levels an hour during the 20's, and he still
has all the ones I wanted to max, maxed. If you start having trouble,
seek out a shaman to buff you with dex and agility, they get those
requests so seldom, that I doubt they will refuse.

This all assumes that you don't want to actively hamper yourself,
which is exactly what you do want to do, so feel free to ignore me. =)
