Never did it as a bard, but did it as an enchanter trying to get robe of
the foci - died alot, I died something like 10 times trying to recover
my body once from the 3rd lv.  Not sure if you can but the dwarves and
erudites both make great pets.  The dwarves are clerics, and the
erudites are necros.  both kick some serious ass, but the dwarves are
harder to deal with if you can't charm em because they always heal up -
they do run out of mana eventually but it can take awhile..  The zone is
megga dangerous, but it's really fun.  It's best if you get a smart
group to come with you though.  

Also the entrance is a bad place to pull too, stuff is always wandering
around.  The exit on lv 2 is probably the best spot, and there are some
relatively safe spots on the 1st lv as well.
