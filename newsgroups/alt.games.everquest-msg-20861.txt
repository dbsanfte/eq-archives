While I personally disagree about it being too strict, even I won't
argue that it's not too open to interpretation. That's about the only
real problem I have with the naming rules. I wouldn't want to be the
poor slob given the task of finding phrasing that wasn't open to
interpretation, though!

I think it'd probably be very eye-opening to see what their
operational costs are, broken down into categories like machines,
maintenance, power, pipeline, and so on.
