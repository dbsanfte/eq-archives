Not sure what you mean by "later levels". If you mean the 50+ strata on uber
raids, then I have no idea. But in the late 30's I can tell you that I've always
got my eye open for a good, similar level rogue to group with. That massive
extra damage makes the fights go by much quicker with less damage/mana sucking
for me.
