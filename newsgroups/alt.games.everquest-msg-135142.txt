Not a lot of 60 shamans are missing this spell anymore, at least not that I
see.   They really upped the drop rate a few months ago.  Any Kunark level
dragon can drop it.  In Veeshan's Peak, more than one per clearing.  Gore,
Talendor and Sev drop it as well though, as does the Protector in Sebilis.
I'm not sure if the normal juggs have a chance to drop it or not.  Super rare
if they do though.

I guess it's not *everywhere*... but it is down from a 75k pp spell to about
30k.
