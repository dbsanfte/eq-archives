Well, if there is anyone else wanting the item you looted, it is only
fair to roll for it. All rolls I have ever been involved in were /rand
100, highest roll wins.

Need before greed is customary in guild situations and/or where nodrop
items are concerned. In pick up groups, I think everyone has a right
to any non-nodrop items. Naturally, nodrop items should ONLY be looted
by people who can use and need them.
