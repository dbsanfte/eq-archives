It really depends on how fast you level. Even soloing, I think I went 
through the whole level 16 in no more than 2 hours. And you can't lose 
more than 1/10 of the level's worth.
In EQ, there's an addition of corpse recovery. In most cases it's 
trivial, in others it's a major pain in the ass.

1) I've seen people crying in EQ as well. 
2) Level 40 in DAOC is comparable to 50 in EQ, since everything after 
that is taking 4-5 times more experience
3) Maybe it changes at 40 dramatically, but at 35 it may take me from 0 
to 30 minutes in a group, or triple that solo.
4) People may be crying because the penalty is more noticeable than it 
was before, but not because it's worse than it was in EQ
