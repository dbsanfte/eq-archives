I'm kind of upside down to most people, I take a night off screwing around
to level vs take a night off leveling to screw around.

Charmed a bull elephant in SK and couldn't find anything close that would
give me experience, so I ran him into the undead ruins and had him wreck
havoc. Pretty pointless, but I found out you can put /pet kill commands in a
stack. You just walk around while your pet is killing monster #1 and target
another 3-4. The pet will go to the next target in the queue after it kills
the current.

I honestly like it best when I screw up. Adds some excitement to the game.
Nothing quite like having charm animal break 2 seconds after you give a /pet
kill. "Hmmm, maybe better change view and use mouse look to see how far they
are behind me." "A rabid Griffene hits you for 60 damage." "Hmmm, looks like
I ran over a Griffene when I was looking behind me." "Feet don't fail me
now!"
