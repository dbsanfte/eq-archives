The "key ring" is just an abstraction, not a physical item. The idea is to
give the players something to hold their keys so we don't have to go jogging
around carrying umpteen no-drop soulbound boat anchors using up precious
inventory space (uh, I'm a Monk...)

Once you've used a key that is able to be put on the ring you should see a
message right after you zone that says "... has been added to your keyring".
Once at least one key is on your keyring, you can type the /key command to
see what keys are on your keyring. If you don't have any keys on the
keyring, typing /key will give you the generic "not a valid command" message
(unless they've since fixed *that* bug).

However, the keyring is currently pretty buggy. I've had it work, seemed to
put keys on the ring just fine, and seemed to work fine with my keys banked,
then one day it didn't work. Ended up having to go all the way back to the
bank to get my key. Key was still listed on my keyring, just wouldn't
acknowledge I could use it.

So, don't rely on the feature working 100% of the time, and do *not* delete
your keys yet! (I'd suggest not doing so for a while even after they claim
it's "safe" - getting GMs to replace a half-dozen keys might prove a
daunting task.)
