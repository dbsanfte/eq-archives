There's also the cases where I'm in some gawd awful zone like GFeymart or Lake
of Ill Manners where my lag bar will suddenly start spiking up and down and
turning red.  If I've just made several transactions, kills, loot, etc. and it
looks like I'm going to crash in a minute, I'll stand up, sit, duck, open a
merchant window (if available) or whatever it takes to see that "Jakugg saved"
message before I black out.  Provides some comfort that the crash isn't going
to cost me everything I just did.
