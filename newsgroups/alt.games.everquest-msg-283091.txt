From what I can find WinXP HomeEdition may have a 4Gig limit.  Limits are 
also related to the motherboards and you will get slower after 2 gigs, since 
takes more time to address the memory.  So check your motherboard specs to 
see if it support beyond 2 gigs.  Just because it has 4 slots does not mean 
4 gigs.

Also check the memory timing of the new chips and if lower than others ones 
change setting in CMOS to match.  Example.. Old use 2-3-2-6 but new chips 
2.5-3-3-7 change system to 2.5-3-3-7 to match the slower memory not the 
faster.  Memory can alway be under clock but will fail if set higher or even 
overheat.  If your memory does not have heat spreaders think about adding 
them (my case temp dropped 3c)

these are cheap one but example
