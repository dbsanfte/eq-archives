My feeble old brain can't dredge up what class you are. Which class and
which spells are you using on the chromas? I've given up loading my
level fifty stun in Skyfire. When I've cast it on chromas, wyverns,
wurms or drakes, I get the "The creature is immune to the stun component
of your spell" message. The only things in Skyfire I can stun with my
wizzie spells are the sperms, and they are so trivial that it's not
worth stunning them. (Generally, my wife's necro pet stuns them so much
they barely move away while feared as it is.)
