It is also pretty much impossible for Verant to know you're using it 
unless you're incredibly, mind-numbingly stupid* about it.  It's a packet 
sniffer that runs on a completely seperate machine, and works by decoding 
the EQ packets that are broadcast on your hub.  For Verant to find it the 
would need to run an agent on your computer that would send broadcast 
messages out on your LAN, notice who responds, then actively probe the 
Linux box to determine that certain ports are listening, which are ports 
that are listening on boxes running ShowEQ.  It's possible, but it's not 
gonna happen.

*  The way that some people get caught running ShowEQ is attacking mobs 
that don't show up on track, can't be seen normally, and are only visable 
on ShowEQ to allow the GMs to catch the really dumb ones.

who doesn't run showEQ, but does have a linux box handy
