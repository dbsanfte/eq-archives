But isn't the biggest part of Eq who you meet ? I have had a ton of
aquaintances and a few friends come and go over the last 4 years Some of the
endeavors that took months to complete are cherished. What I miss are not
the "gaming" parts of the game. I miss friends that no longer play or are
doing hop skip from game to game.
EQ ties a game and socializing and even being off by yourself while
listening to a noisy chat entertaining.

I don't think i will desire to load up the old version of a MMORG.
I am confident programmers ability to improve the magic of EQ will continue.
I am sure lots of speed bumps will be encountered on the way ensuring the
journey is fun indeed.
