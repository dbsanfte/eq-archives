My friend got burned by a scammer.

Account name: sanfranfan007
old secret question: birthplace.  old secret answer: juarez

Has numerous characters across a few servers but the main are Aamlord
and Aamaam both on Maelin Starpyre.

Luis Garza sold this acount on eBay, waited a few months to make
payment reversal impossible, then changed the secret password and
won't return any message.

I wouldn't be surprised if you see a 70 beastlord with 600+ AA on
Maelin server showing up on an auction at one point in the near future
to rip off another buyer.
