"You tell the group, "Hi guys, thanks for the group.  I really
appreciate it!" You tell the group, "Just so you all know, I suck.

"Now when I decide to scream obscenities across a zone, then run
from the GM when they show up, I won't petition when the DA fails to
save my ass."

"Annie <--- Would keep playing anyways, unless Sims Online turns out
