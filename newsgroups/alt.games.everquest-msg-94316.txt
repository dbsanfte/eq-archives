$10/hour to spend about 6 hours a day hanging out in a game 5 days a
week. True, they're doing CS there, but still... Most likely they also
get their play EQ account(s) for free. Possibly there are other
benefits to the job (health, etc?), but I have no signs one way or the
other on that. The few GMs I've talked with on the subject have been
on the job for over a year.

*Shrug* Yeah, it's not great, but considering the line of work... It's
not tech support for a highly technical piece of equipment. It's
mostly looking over logs, handing out warnings/name changes/etc,
reimbursing equipment, and such. It's closer to "nanny" than tech
support.
