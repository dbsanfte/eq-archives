The way I understood the patch message when they made that change was that you
automatically get an itme of the appropriate type, either food or drink, depending on 
your condition. I wouldn't know from experience becuase even though Iksars are 
capped at 50, I have never been low on either item.

The trick, for my fellow scaled ones and those of pointy ears who are neither ranger nor
druid, is to foarge whenever you have downtime. As soon as that button recycles, you 
click it again. Xiser forages while pulling sometimes. Since I started aquiring for nourishment
entirely by foraging I have always been around a full stack of drink, often above, and have
only gone low on food once or twice.

The day you can forage heady kiolas is the day all Iksar monks will rejoice.
