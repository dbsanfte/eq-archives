With the exceptions of Karnors, Sebilis and Velks, pretty much every dungeon
is a BYOG zone.

If you want my honest opinion, your best choice of action is hinted at by
your response...  You've got a ranger friend that will go with you anywhere.
Find 4 more people that you enjoy spending time around, and your hunting
styles are compatible... and start taking them everywhere.

Right now my "regular hunting group" is around 8 to 10 people... we all sort
of play the same hours, are competent players, enjoy each others company,
have a good variety of classes, etc...   and we've gone pretty much
everywhere.   I think it's really the only way to play the game.

If we hadn't started playing together, would I still be 64 and a half now?
Probably (or maybe that should be eventually)...  but if I had stuck with
pickup groups or even guild groups to get there, I wouldn't have seen one
quarter of the amount of the game that I have, or had one tenth the amount
of fun doing it.    Just the same 4 "easy grouping" exp zones....
