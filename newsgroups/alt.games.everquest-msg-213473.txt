You weren't counting the pet procs? ;) Sure, damage doesn't show, but
if you look it up you can estimate it in.... Also, the first couple
spell levels, the pets do lag behind a bit, but power picks up
relatively swiftly...

The faction, as far as I know, can only be raised via a quest that
involves a turn-in to NPCs on that faction. Perhaps buy one of the
shaman racial illusion potions for a neutral/good race and look up the
quest on Alakhazam's....?
