I could duo (paladin + cleric) in Vermin's Snye from, IIRC, level
14, and probably solo too (definitely at 15).  The same should hold in
Blackburrow.  Just go for the green, and maybe blue, group mobs.  Or
you could go for green group mobs in Antonica, gnolls or scarecrows or
crabs or stags or whatever.  Generally speaking green group mobs are
still viable for a soloing paladin up to level 21, so for a duo it
should be fairly effortless.

Oh, and make sure to pick up all the tome quests from the librarian in
the Three Towers, they're decent exp and great coin if you sell the
books (62.5 silver each).  And of course all other quests having to do
with wherever you're going, as well.  Levelling will still get slower,
but that's the way it's meant to be, and levelling in the early levels
is way too fast anyway, IMHO.
