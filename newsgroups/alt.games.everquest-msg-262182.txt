    And slowing. Slowing is a huge ability, too.

    Most GoD mobs are flagged non-charmable, mainly because mobs that hit 
for over 1000 are stupidly overpowered when charmed.

    This is the OoW solution. The mobs don't hit terribly hard to begin 
with, and when charmed their max hit drops by a significant margin (50% in 
most cases). So you can charm a mob, but it won't do stupid damage when 
charmed.

> And the combination of single-pulling of mobs in OoW and mez resists

    My group in WoS this past weekend was pulling six mobs at a time and 
letting the enchanter mez them. If she'd been having difficulty, we would 
have been dead most of the day. As for why you'd do that, look at XP rate 
when there's a steady supply of mobs in camp and the puller spends most of 
his time adding DPS in camp versus single pulling with a mostly absentee 
puller.

    Most of the mobs in WoS summon, many cast. There's no replacement for 
mez on summoning casters.

    And slowing. Not hugely exciting, but important. Compare the role of the 
ENC (slowing, CC, charming if desired, weak DPS, buffing) with that of 
shamans (slowing, weak DPS, buffing) and tell me who gets it worse.
