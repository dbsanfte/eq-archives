Sounds like they lost a raid controller(s), and that they didn't have
a complete and current (within the last 24hours) backup.

From the description of their restoration method it looks like they do
a periodic full backup, then an incremental for more recent data. In
other words they load the last full backup (which could include old
characters), then begin loading each incremental until they hit the
most recent. 

It's not a bad method of recovery, but it is only as good as the last
increment. Which is most likely  why Prexus lost 24+hours. I would
hazard a guess that the timing of the hardware failure could not have
been worse since it fell so close to a major patch. It is possible
that they skipped an incremental backup due to the patch, resulting in
a greater loss of data when Prexus crashed.
