Well - the announcement and the dev-chat are almost certainly
on coincidendental.  OTOH - I really doubt that the threat of
a stand down caused them to suddenly come up with this idea.

Caster balancing took over a year - and many of us saw nothing
for a very long time, and no indications of what was coming down
the line.  I'd wager they've been hashing this out, designing it,
and probably running some simulations for quite a while before
the warrior strike.
