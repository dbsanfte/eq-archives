Hi there,

I suppose you are interested in the $75 at PartyPoker.com that I am
willing to offer you, and I also suppose that you don't believe it is
actually working. Well, surprise! You are WRONG my friend!

I am impressed that you had common sense and pressed the button, and
entered this topic, because you will also get rewarded. You are
probably thinking right now: what the f***, I am here for the free
money. Well, some people needs these fancy introductions to believe in
me.

Lets cut the bullshit and start all over again.

--- About the offer ---

-	Just simply press this link: http://www.partybacker.com/?bonus=715
after you have read the rest of this post
-	You will get $75 totally free at PartyPoker.com if you fulfill the
requirements below. No risk, no deposit, no credit card needed!
-	First you will get $50 dollars instant and then $25 after 250 raked
(every hand you put money in) hands.
-	You will also be able to play the new player $5000 freeroll, and the
other new player freerolls available everyday.

--- Requirements ---

-	You cannot have an account with PartyPoker.com at this point. The
offer is only valid to new users. That's just how it is, and you can't
get around it, if you don't ask a friend or a family member to sign
up. This is to prevent fraud.
-	You have to provide Partybacker and PartyPoker.com with REAL account
information. That's pretty obvious.
-	You must follow instructions given by Partybacker during
registration the be eligible to receive this offer. If not, you will
simply not get the money, and you can't try again, unless you mail
support or ask kindly in their forum.
-	Only 1 IP / mailing address per person, to prevent fraud as well.
-	This offer is only valid for residents coming from: AUSTRALIA,
BELGIUM, CANADA, DENMARK, FINLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, ICELAND, ITALY,
LUXEMBOURG, MALTA, NETHERLANDS, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SPAIN, SWEDEN,
SWITZERLAND, UNITED KINGDOM

--- Recommendations by me (have done it myself) ---

-	Simply put, do what the tell you to do and don't rush, it won't make
you get the money faster.
-	Understand the requirements, and be sure that you fulfill them
before signing up.
-	If you have problems just mail them or write in their forum under
the topic: testimonials.
-	Play conservatively after you have got the $50 so you can get the
extra $25 nice and easy. I recommend many tables and low blinds and a
tight aggressive style of playing.
--- Still don't believe me? ---

-	Check it out yourself; it is worth a try if you are not sure? And I
promise you it will work.
-	Here is some evidence that it works... should not need it, but some
people are stubborn as hell. Ex. 1:
