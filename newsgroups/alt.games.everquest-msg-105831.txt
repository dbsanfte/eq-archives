Whats funny about the drop rate is that it is true!  Before they nixxed the
"be a creature", i played as a lion a few times.  I checked my inventory and
low and behold there was a medium quality pelt.  Too bad the zones I were
put in were so empty no one wanted to kill me :(  But yes loot is determined
before kill...or more succinctly at spawn time.
