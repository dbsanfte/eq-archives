Well, the problem is that a warrior isn't really built to solo at your
level. I'll give you some ideas for hunting grounds though, maybe one or
other of them will be a viable spot to pick up a group at the times you
play. Not sure you could really solo at any of these spots...

Splitpaw (Tesch gnolls at spires or inside - Lteth will be green
probably, but nothing else will be)

Overthere (wildlife etc - you can get non-stop pulls going here)

Iceclad (cougars)

Eastern Wastes (Ulthorks etc, maybe a Rygorr or giant group, or dwarves
I guess if you're that way inclined, with plenty of support)

Crystal Caverns (Rygorr, spiders, etc)

Mistmoore (yard trash should be blue still... watch out for trains here
though, and don't go inside unless its with a mob of groupmates in tow)

Highkeep (there's often a long waiting list to get in a warrior room
group etc, but if you play in off hours this might be the solution)

Dalnir (Kinda bring your own group)

Rathe Mountains (Hill giants - MAKE MONEY FAST!!! Hope that hasn't made
too many folks' newreaders plonk me...)

I'm guessing places like Kaesora, Droga, Nurga, Tower of Frozen Shadow,
etc would be doable to some extent in a group of low to mid 30s, but
they're all bring-your-own-group places and I haven't been there, so
check them out first.
