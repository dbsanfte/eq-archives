Actually the levitate effect on the cloak can be damn useful to non-mages,
so he loses out on that point. Not that mages own the quillmaine spawn
anyway. Farming quillmaine to MQ to a mage seems perfectly reasonable to me,
especially when no mage has said they are camping him.

I was incredibly lucky, my necro just happened to run into him at KFC when I
was about lvl 28. I just managed to kill him, and he dropped the cloak.
Necros dont get levi till level 44 (dmf), so I has 18 levels of levitate I
would otherwise not have had. In the days before you could bind in TD, this
was incrdibly useful for using the firepot room. Someday ill mq the cloak.
They go for 10k on our server.
