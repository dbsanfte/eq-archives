    Oh, no, you're going to tell every druid on the server not to port
someone, and they'll listen and stick up for you! They won't just ask for
payment up front, what few that care what you have to say - not after you
educate them! And the wizards, too, don't forget the wizards!

    There's nothing sadder than a porter that thinks they can get someone
boycotted, especially on flimsy grounds like this. Hell, I couldn't get a
"no res" order enforced on someone if I tried and there's fewer res-capable
players than port-capable ones. Maybe YOU wouldn't port him ever again, but
given you don't know the difference between GFay and Butcherblock I don't
see that as a bad thing.
