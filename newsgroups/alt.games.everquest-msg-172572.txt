Yup, but dont forget, you don't have to equipe the SoTF to get the
right clicky effect.  Just keep it in an inventory slot and hotkey it.
That way you can still carry another staff with stats.

Another useful use it has is to blind your friends.  It can be chain
cast as fast as you can click it.  If they have thier spell effects
turned on it can be very annoying.  I did this at a 'just for fun'
arena bash in my guild.  It was about the only thing I could do to the
level 50+ tanks to even bother them.  It is mean though, so make sure
your friends have a sense of humor.

By far it's the most useful hardware a wizard ever gets.

Also, if you want the Ice Comet spell, you need to have a staff of the
wheel.  Spose there is a multiquest method too but someone will need
it.
