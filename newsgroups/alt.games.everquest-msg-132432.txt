My friends all love to drive around with me, They alway ask if I'm
going to take the 'Time Machine " out. Everything is original, but I
do have a cd player in the trunk and the acutal player in the glove
box, with an original AM radio in the dash that works. And the car is
a pleasure to drive, a it does kinda feel like your back in time
driving up and down the coast with the top down and the beach Boys
playing. ( korny yes, but it feels good) . The thing is it runs better
now than it do new, those Stangs had lousy steering and suspension,
but with what you can do to it today the things a road hugger.  I love
it when some kid pulls up next to  in a  new Stang and starts to act
all stupid by reving up his birthday gift. I've got a 302 under the
hood that no computer will ever regulate Ya gotta love the look they
give you when you take off, hehehe.

nice indeed.
