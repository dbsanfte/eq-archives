Had this happen before as well, no idea how to replicate it, so I
never bothered with it anymore.  Logged in once, I think it was north
ro..  actually *over* north ro, by several hundred feet.  Fortunatly
for me, I had Levitate still on from the night before, so I was able
to float safely back to the ground.

Upon zoning again (into East commons this time), I found myself with
the message "Player under the world, at (whatever loc), moving to a
safepoint now.  Safe point, of course, turned out to be somewhere in
orbit in the middle of the planes of East Commons, nowhere near the
tunnel.   Again, I was able to safely float down to the ground.

I actually would have played around with this some more (after all, it
was pretty neat), but chances were levitate would wear off in the
middle of the next zone, or worse...  So I simply logged out, came
back in, and had no further problems.

I've heard this kind of problem can happen to AMD processors (it was
apparently a regular occurence in Rivervale), although they supposedly
fixed the bug quite some time back.
