I don't own a horse (never had enough pp for one), but.....

In my opinion, if you're high enough level, do the Journeyman's Boots quest
and forget about a horse. The cheapest horse is supposed to be just slightly
slower than Jboots, while the fastest is close to a Spirit of Cheetah spell
in speed. But they're vastly overpriced; I'd rather buy some great Int and
Mana gear for my casters or weapons for my Warrior that spend much than a
horse.

Unless you're filthy rich, don't bother.
