I hate quoting a lot and not adding much, but I also have a suggestion.  If
you plan on taking off for a while, but you definately plan on coming back,
I'd suggest selling ALL of your gear that you can.  Get to your auction zone
and get rid of everything.  Armor, weapons, packs....lose it.  Why?

EQ's economy (such as it is) means that items never increase in value,
except a VERY FEW rare exceptions (manastone, pre-nerf Circlet
of Shadows, etc.).  If you sell your full set of Ry`Gorr and two Lammys
now, and just leave the character in your auction zone, the day you
come back you'll be able to buy even better  armor and weapons, or
at least get back to where you were with some extra cash on hand.

I know somebody that left EQ right before Kunark came out.  He
sold everything, including some top of the line for the time gear.
This was back in the days when Serrated Bone Dirks were a
standard 1000 pp across many servers.  He had two, plus a full
suit of Ravenscale armor, back when the armor was still new and
rare.  He sold it, too.  Let's just say that when he finally got done
with his tour he came back to a very different economy, re-equiped
himself BETTER than before, and still had some major cash left over.
I mean, if you can sell a FBSS for 20000 in straight cash, and
come back online when they sell for 8-10000, I think you see my
point.

I guess I did add more than just a little.
