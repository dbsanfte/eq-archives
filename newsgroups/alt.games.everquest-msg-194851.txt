The Burynaibane Spiders are also around L3-L4, but it's not easy
for a non-iksar lowbie to get to FoB w/o PoP, nigh impossible for
a "light" race lowbie w/o PoP I'd guess.  Not that it's all that
easy to get to Shadeweaver's w/o PoP unless you are a Rogue or can
cast Invis (Camo can't be cast indoors).  A halfling might be able
to sneak thru PC even if not a Rogue, not sure, but if so it's one
more thing to hold against the little jerks.

Of the new lowbie quest weapons I've checked out, the SF Glade
Druid quest scimitar is one of the best and might be the easiest
to get (usable by half-elf or human Druids, no diety restriction).
The SSoL I mentioned in my previous post can be done at even
lower level, any "lightie" with Invis and about 6pp can do it
easily without PoP, gets a droppable CLR/PAL usable magic mace
that is also a light source, very handy for night-blind races.
