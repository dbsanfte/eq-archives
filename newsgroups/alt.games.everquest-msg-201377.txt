You never indicated that the use of LS was for the sole purpose of
estimating the total HPs of the Zelniaks. The reader is left to assume
that you were still talking about level 28, since you did not qualify
the statement, leaving only the context of the post to work with.

Without a qualifying statement nesting your use of the level 34 spell
in your calculations appears to indicate that you were hunting with
the spell at level 28.

The statement you quoted above is only correct if it is NOT preceded
by "Okay, at 28...." 3 paragraphs above. Reread your whole post again,
You jump from using level 24 spells to 34 spells, and then back again
without any qualifying statements. Someone unfamiliar with the Druid
spell line-up would be mislead into thinking that you were describing
two different ways of killing Zels at level 28 (DD-Quad and Root/Rot).

You gave no indication to the reader that your inclusion of the level
34 spell was for the sole purpose of estimating the total HPs of the
Zels. Therein lies the confusion.

Obviously this is the result of a misunderstanding. :-)
