I'm not sure how much I'd pay. From spot-checking a few items, it appears to 
be 1AC more than cured silk. I've been looking for +AC and +STR items rather 
than +AGI, but maybe I've received bad advice. :-) I'm wearing mostly cured 
silk now, with a Foreman's Tunic (AC10 STR+3) and a few other odd pieces. 
Now 
I'm looking for "big" upgrades like Azure Sleeves (AC12), and probably 
wouldn't spend a whole heck of a lot for only 1 more AC per piece. You might 
be able to sell full suits to people looking to outfit newly created monk 
alts. Then again I'm a tightwad monk. :-)

But that's just my 2cp..
Anita
