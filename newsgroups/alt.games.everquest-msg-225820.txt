Currently, about 90% of my play is LDoN. In my experience, the key things
that people look for when forming groups are:

1. Healing - this is probably the only non-negotiable of the three
2. CC - Some way to manage adds when pulling.
3. DPS - Gotta be able to take them out fast and efficiently

Reasonable people make powerful arguments either way on which of 2 or 3 is
more significant (I think 3 is) but I see more people willing to sacrifice 3
than 2. If all these melee changes go into effect AND warriors were to get a
better taunt than Knights, 2 assures that Pacifying Knights will *still* be
preferred or at least welcome on the same basis as Warriors.

This sounds like a good time to ask for a read-out on how taunt and hate
work and how they interact with each other. Some of the discussion here has
left me feeling that there are probably many subtleties that I don't fully
appreciate. Please elaborate.
