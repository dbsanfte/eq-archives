LOL...running out of ideas so try playing on people prejudices.
Next you'll be insulting peoples mothers.

Of course, you might be serious and living proof that Darwin was wrong.
In which case. Guilds are in game alliances not online social clubs because
all the members are, in RL, Gay Teenagers (of course you meant us to read
between the lines there) or all ride Honda Fireblades or all have a fetish
for plastic house hold containers.
So no, GM's would not be impressed with real life prejudices as part of it's
charter.

I think troll but I get this nagging doubt that it just maybe the shallow
end of the gene pool.
