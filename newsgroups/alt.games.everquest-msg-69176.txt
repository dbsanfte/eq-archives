It should be playable, provided you turn some options off. I'm on a AMD 450,
384 MB, GeForce 2 Pro 64MB.

Old world is fine with most graphics options on and clip plane out to full,
even with the recommended 20 new models loaded and the retextured zones
installed. Only complaint is that fogging tends to come on and off at will
when I zone.

Luclin gets awfully choppy until I start turning off options and pull the
clip plane in to at least half.
