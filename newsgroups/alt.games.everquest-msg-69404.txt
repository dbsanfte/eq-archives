I don't know about those particular critters, sorry, if one gives more
faction points than others.

However, I DO know that it doesn't matter if they're green or not.  Hell, it
doesn't matter if you KILL them or not.  All you have to do is be on their
hate list when they die.

If there's a party in there hunting stuff that's green to you, offer to help
them out (a few swings, or maybe buffs if you're a caster) without taking
their kills and with no interest in loot.  They get more xp, you get good
faction hits...it's win-win.

If there's no group then yes, kill kill kill greenies.
