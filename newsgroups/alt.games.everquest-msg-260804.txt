Something I have noticed though. You get significantly fewer skill ups
the closer you are to the trivial. I don't know how the geerloks
factor into this but, When making Patty Melts, I got a skill up about
1 in 5 or 6 even when I was failing 3/4 of the combines, but once I
got up to within 10 points of the trivial, the skill up rate dropped
to 1 in 12. For Alchemy and Smithing it was even worse. I was getting
1 skill up in 15 on Smithing (doing the Karana followers arrowheads,
Yay FV!) once I was within 10 points of the trivial. Alchemy got down
to 1 in 20 skill ups within 5 points of the trivial for Titan Potions.
(At something like 16pp per combine (IIRC) that was quite painful.)

I'm a firm believer in skilling up on combines well above my current
level, and not using the geerloks until I'm making something
specifically for sale.
