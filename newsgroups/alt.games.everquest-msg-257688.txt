Well this thread has gone way off topic... so this is NOT directed at the OP,
who clearly stated already that he has decent gear.  I'm going to go even MORE
way off topic.
I'm really straddling the fence on this one.  I totally understand someone
being gear / plat impaired.  By that I mean upgrading themselves is beyond
their means.  I can remember a time when someone asked me to pick up a stack of
rations for them in town and I thought: "jeez, do you think I'm made of
money"???
VENT:
OTOH, I can remember being frustrated *at lower levels* when I would take the
time and spend MY hard earned money to get a KEI and reagents and run down and
join a group full of people and the MT was still carrying a fine steel sword
wearing leather armor.  And then that person would proudly announce that he had
looted everything he owned.  DUH?  YA THINK WE COULDN'T FIGURE THAT OUT AFTER
FIVE MINUTES?  Just because you are roleplaying doesn't mean you can't kill 50
spiders and get yourself some Ry`gorr armor in the bazaar for cryin out loud. 
You still earned it!!!!
I'm all FOR people taking the path less chosen.  But find a group of friends
with similar mindset please!  OR, at the very least, don't be surprised and
whine when you are unable to find groups and say EQ sucks because *you* have
chosen to walk a different direction and have 10 year old gear when you are 30
years old.  
Roleplaying is fine.  My friends have a group set up for just that.  Sometimes
its nice to return to your roots.  But the *majority* of people don't want to
wait 5 minutes between mobs because the cleric AND druid are OOM, especially in
a LDON where TIME MATTERS.  Some of your groupmates really WANT to win the
mission points.
Last but not least:  This game is not centered around *you*.  I'm sorry. 
That's just a fact.  So grow up and start acting like a team player if you want
to play in *groups* in a GROUP oriented world.  
Final disclaimer:  This is NOT directed at the OP.
OK I'm done now.
