They already pretty much said no in a release about CS.

Really it only takes a few more GMS to take up guide slack. You have
to remember that guides were volunteers and on mostly when THEY wanted
to be on, for that 10 hours a week. Though guides could help with
simple things, like explaining when a person could not get GM help for
something, they were useless for things they had to accelerate to GMS.

Many customers, myself included, know the game well enough to know
when we need a GM or a guide. Anytime a guide would have been enough,
I could solve the problem myself. The roughly 6 times I've petitioned
in three and half years in which I knew I needed GM help, I had to
wait for Bobo the flunky to pass me on.

Decentralizing GMS was the first good step. I've been telling them to
do that in dev board messages for three years. Users complain at
first, but the good part is when you don't have to worry that no GMS
are around on your server in particular. I once had to wait 3 real
time days, as told by a guide, for the GM to return on the server I
was on to fix an issue. This is inexcuseable. Imagine getting customer
service at your cable or phone company and having them tell you that
you had to wait three days for "real customer service" to be there to
fix this problem for you.

Price increases don't come willy nilly. When they did the move to
$12.95 they already knew a lot of the things they were going to change
and what the additional money would be used for. Companies like this
don't decide to overhaul CS on Monday and implement it on Tuesday.
