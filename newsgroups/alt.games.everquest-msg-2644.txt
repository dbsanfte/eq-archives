I can vouch for this. Since the hybrid changes in a recent patch,
whereby spells don't interrupt your melee attacks quite so much. I
spent several levels hunting in City of Mist and I frequently cast an
undead DD spell between swings. The 94dmg every few seconds
helps contribute do your damage output, especially as SKs are prone
to missing. ;)
