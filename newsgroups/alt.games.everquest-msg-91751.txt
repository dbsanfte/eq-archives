You use Outlook Express...they have a decent message filter, you might try
fiddling with it.  I usually knock out about 1/3 of posts before I even see
them.

MY filter gets rid of any post with the following words in the subject line:

Hmmm, recently cleaned it out...all I have are "fuck" and "wtf" 'cause you
know both of those will be whiner posts.  I also have no problem adding
folks to my Blocked Senders List if I know that they're unlikely to ever
contribute anything I'll want to read.
