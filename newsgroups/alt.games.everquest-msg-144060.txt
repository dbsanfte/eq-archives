Vext Thal has been buggy for months, amd it seems after all the player
feedback Verant has done little or nothing to fix this zone. Risk versus
reward is not as good as ntov. Also the zone has become buggy pretty bad
now, with mobs have 10x the hp they should.

As reading on the foh website mobs taking half an hour to kill are now
taking 1 hour and 40 minutes. It would be nice to see Verant to actually
start working actively with guilds like these to improve and fix the content
instead of suspending/banning them for exploits.
