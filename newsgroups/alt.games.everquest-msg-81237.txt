All halflings hate you because of your heritage. Welcome to the
realization that some people will try to kill you on sight. (KOS)

You can, after a few levels of hunting in Runnyeye, and then giving
stacks of bandages to a certain merchant in Misty Thicket, convince them
to like you.

But otherwise, look up the recipe for hot and spicy toelings, and hunt
them down when you are bigger. Currently, you are too small to attract
their attention for anything other than target practice.
