I dont , it was stupid . I could afford a fast horse but would never spend
that much for one . A horse is not as good as jboots in that you cant zone
with it into a dungeon where the buff will still be good , and mobs aggro as
if you are always sitting (which you are) . The aggro thing is annoying . I
would put the price of the slower than jboot horse at maybe 3k and the
fastest horse at 30k. That way you may actually get some people to buy them
. Right now I regard them as a stupid person tax.
