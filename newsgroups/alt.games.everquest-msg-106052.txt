Umm druid started to suck for me at about 40.  Still recovering
emotionally from trying to be main healer in chain pulling group with
no mana pump. /shiver

Seems like I got my cleric to 50 faster than soloed druid from 34 to
41. But Kunrark came out when cleric got to 20's, so had lot better
hunting areas too. Had helluva lot more fun anyways. Plus had lot of
stuff from get go. Got a naked 41 druid still to gate friends but
thats it  :)

Besides everyone knows Mage is the de facto soloing class. muhahah
