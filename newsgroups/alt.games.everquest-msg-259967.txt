This is exactly what it will be like for the first few weeks of
release.

ALL the quest mobs are camped. Heck as far as I could tell every
single spawn in the entire newbie area of the game was camped. You
don't seem to be picking up on this. It's not a question of doing a
popular quest. Every single quest is in the same boat.

Another fool. Btw, you'd be surprised how many of the antisocial types
are drinking age and older. You don't understand the battlenet
population very well. Or at all.

No, it's you.
