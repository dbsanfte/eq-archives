Well, not sure if i did the right thing today-have 2 quick stories
about clerics 'never rez' list and  vengance, first story i'm happy
about, 2nd, i kinda happy but maybe think i shoulda handled it diff-
story 1-in rm with partner (we 50/51), this 59 wizzy or mage routinley
KS's everyone, and is the type to mock u out loud, or threatens to
train others, covered as 'just humor' of course-so anyway he Ks's my
partner 1 day ( a real bad ks, not the common, marginal ones that
happen all the time) and then snears ooc when confronted-a week later,
he dies, and then has the stupidity to give me 'tell', asking fer rez,
and whats my % ...ect-  but since he made my 'never rez' list i ooc
respond exactly why i will never rez him-he shut up and several others
in zone congratulate me, obviously we not only ones that dislike
him-ahh, felt good-than several weeks later, i run into him in KC-this
time he is  in big bitch fest ooc argument with several others in zone
over him training them ect  -i jump in and  ooc the RM story,  and all
the others laugh and he logs-  :)
story 2-in KC, good group doing hand room-only bad thing is a greedy
rogue, that kneels on everything (over 3 hr period), bitches when he's
forced to roll 0 101 on the few good things we get, whines how he
'needs' the kunar cloak for its fire prot LOL (he 58lvl), another guy
wins a charged item, and he has the balls to ask a charge be spent on
him (had nothing to do with combat)-and finally when we get in
trouble-he bugs out and hides before leader calls run-then when we all
zoned from train-with one dead-he quits group with no explanation and
lfg's to zone-others pissed as much as I-so we sort it all out, get 2
new peeps, but one short-and the dang group leader reinvites him back
in!!-says guys explained he left group by 'mistake'-so i'm fuming
since i asked he not get back in-but i shut up, and go along-we try to
retake room, but get massive jumped in LCY, this stinking thief
dies(not my fault-honest! :)
, rest of us fight well,at least  4 minutes more, finally kill all
mobs-through fight he bugging for rez, asking for %,- all the others
politly tell him quiet, we still fighting-so when all done, i'm really
fuming at this guy, heal rest of group-and tell them i have to go-1
says ok, and they advertise fer new clr-i quickly disband and gate
(obviously i dont rez him)-then stinking thief 'tells' me & is pissed
that i didnt rez him, soooo...we get into it, call each bad names,
that sort of thing-he clueless about why i pissed at him which i would
expect..., but then other guy from group(one of new ones) 'tells' me,
asking if i rezing thief-i say no, he a jerk, and camp-SO..., i'm glad
I chose not to rez the little prick, but i feel kinda bad i did not
rez a party member and did not tell others why, or perhaps there is no
good why-i choose to stay in party with him (i think that was my real
mistake)-I feel a maybe let THEM down, and shoulda rezzed jerk, not
for him, but for them?-what u guys think?-I'm starting to think that i
let my group down, and now i look like the jerk-sigh--this game would
be so simple if folks just tried a little bit to get along :)-thanks
for any feedback, positive or negative-Ironeyes-52 clr dwf-Rathe
