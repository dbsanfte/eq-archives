6. We may terminate this Agreement (including your Software license and your
Account) immediately and without notice if you breach this Agreement or
repeatedly infringe any third party intellectual property rights, or if we
are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us, or
upon gameplay, chat or any player activity whatsoever which is, in our sole
discretion, inappropriate and/or in violation of the spirit of the Game as
set forth in the player rules of conduct, which are posted at
www.everquest.com. If we terminate this Agreement under these circumstances,
you will lose access to your Account for the balance of any prepaid period
without any refund.  We may also terminate this Agreement if we decide, in
our sole discretion, to discontinue offering the Game, in which case we may
provide you with a prorated refund of any prepaid amounts.

7. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we hereby grant to you a
non-exclusive license to use the Software solely in connection with playing
the Game via an authorized and fully-paid Account. You may not copy (except
to make one necessary back-up copy), distribute, rent, lease, loan, modify
or create derivative works, adapt, translate, perform, display, sublicense
or transfer the Software. You may not copy any of the written materials
accompanying the CD-ROM.  You may not reverse engineer, disassemble or
decompile the Software except to the extent that this restriction is
expressly prohibited by applicable law. The Software may contain license
management software that restricts your use of the Software.

rights relating to or residing in the CD-ROM, the Software and the Game. The
Software is a "commercial item.

9. You may not use any third party software to modify the Software to change
Game play. You may not use our intellectual property rights contained in the
Game or the Software to create or provide any other means through which the
Game may be played by others, as through server emulators. You may not take
any action which imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on
our infrastructure. You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters,
items, coin or copyrighted material.

<snip>

13. WE PROVIDE THE CD-ROM, THE SOFTWARE, THE ACCOUNT, THE GAME AND ALL OTHER
SERVICES "AS IS."  WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Without limiting the foregoing, we do
not ensure continuous, error-free, secure or virus-free operation of the
CD-ROM, the Software, the Game or your Account. Some states do not allow the
disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply
to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have
other legal rights which vary from state to state.

We are not liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from any
causes beyond our reasonable control. Further, we cannot and do not promise
or ensure that you will be able to access your Account whenever you want,
and there may be extended periods of time when you cannot access your
Account.

14. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE, OUR PARENT, OUR AFFILIATES OR OUR SUPPLIERS BE
LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE)
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCOUNT, THE GAME, THE CD-ROM OR
THIS AGREEMENT. OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IS LIMITED TO
$100. Some states do not allow the foregoing limitations of liability, so
they may not apply to you.

15. You shall comply with all applicable laws regarding your use of the
Software, your access to your Account and your playing of the Game. Without
limiting the foregoing, you may not download, use or otherwise export or
re-export the Software except in full compliance with all applicable laws
and regulations.

16. This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of the State of
California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be
performed entirely within California between California residents. The UN
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
disclaimed. Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction in California and
further agree that any cause of action relating to this Agreement shall be
brought in a court in San Mateo County, California. If any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Our failure to act
with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act
with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. You may not assign or
transfer this Agreement or your rights hereunder, and any attempt to the
contrary is void. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and
agreement between us and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Except as provided above, this Agreement may not be amended except in a
writing signed by both parties.
