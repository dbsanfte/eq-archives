My guild wants to have a nice ceremony for the promotion of one of our
members to officer. The trouble is that we can't think of a nice, remote,
location where there is not to much spam and wandering players.
It has to be a good-looking place prferable a temple or such. No npc's is a
pre, but not required. No mobs which are KOS though.

Does anyone know of a location?

thanks

Kilmir
