The more I think about it the more I've decided that the player I'm playing
wouldn't auction it.  I'd either sell it or since now I know who needs it,
I'll give it to a poor monk next time I'm in qeynos.  I'm there a lot since
I'm a newbie ranger.

I wish I could get a lot for it because the stupid thing took me down to 1
bubble of health and gave me somekind of disease.
