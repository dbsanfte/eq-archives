Apparently, the actual effect is the same. For instance, the improved
damage gives you a shot at 20% additional damage on a DD. Thing is, they
don't want sorcerers immediatly being able to get an additional 20% on
Sunstrike simply because they have an orc pawn pick in their backpack.

So it would seem that you have to have an item that *VI* thought was
appropriate for the level of the spell. (Note: Some of these are just
whacko and I expect them to change. Stuff that drops in LGuk has a level
I effect while something that drops in Najena has a level II. /sigh )

But remember also, it's the level of the *spell*... not the level of the
caster. I happened to have one of the items that gives spell haste for
level I. Useless for a 41 wizard, right? Nope. When I cast gate the item
glowed and my gate went off faster because it's a low level spell. I can
picture this being useful in a GET OUT NOW OR DIE situation.
