I don't think you can put that genie back in the bottle.  The monk nerf 
didn't really cripple them as much as you might think; it didn't make 
them that much worse as pullers for exp groups.  It didn't affect their 
pulling ability at all, in fact, what it did was damage their ability to 
survive hard pulls, where they used to be able to withstand a beating 
getting things set up, and with their mitigation nerfed, they no longer 
could do this as well.

It was a nerf to their ability to solo, or to function as main tank; 
they used to (potentially, with the sort of AC they were never intended 
to have) be so good at not taking damage that they were actually more 
efficient than plate classes if you weren't using a CHeal plan.

I don't think even a full restoration of that degree of mitigation would 
change things for them now (other than the soloing) because the exp mobs 
people go after these days are not the light hitting mobs of those old 
days; now you need someone who can take thousands of points of damage 
over a short period of time, and that spells tanks.

Since their ability to -do- damage wasn't nerfed, and their ability to 
split pull wasn't nerfed (except in cases where they now get killed 
trying it) putting back their mitigation won't help much.

Whats happened that really kills monks is that we've been forced to 
learn other pull methods; SK take a beating better, so they started 
trying pulling more even though their FD is inferior to monk... and 
turns out that with snare (a tool they had all along) they can do the 
splits more reliably, faster, easier than monks.

Further, Lull was fixed; back in the old days it failed 75% of the time 
and aggroed the whole room 75% of the time when it did fail.  Now its 
usable, quite reliable (still the occaisional disaster, but rare enough 
to just write in as part of the plan).  Need for FD splitting drops 
dramatically.  No matter what you restore to monks, unless you rebreak 
lull, its going to be used far more than FD splitting, which simply 
takes longer.

Once upon a time, monks were known as -the- pulling class.  Now, there 
are SK, bard, paladin, cleric, and even Necro pullers, heck, given how 
much outdoor action there is these days, ranger and druid pullers too 
see a lot of use.

Part of the claim you'll see time and again is that monks are the best 
pullers because they know best -how- to pull.  But thats old school 
thinking; there because those monks were created by players who wanted 
to be pullers, and who spent lots of time refining their pulling skills. 
  If you wanted to be a puller, you made a monk, and if you were a monk, 
you pulled all the time, so you learned.

But now, so long after the nerf, there are tons of monks who haven't 
been serious pullers ever, because they aren't as effective at it as 
other classes.  And someone who wants to be a puller has probably made a 
SK or bard or paladin (the latter doomed to dissapointment at high 
levels)  and players of those classes have had the same sort of "of 
course I'm the puller" experience that was once the unique province of 
monks.  Heck, I know former monks who have rerolled as SK so as to be 
better able to apply their knowledge with a real puller class.

Give monks back the ability to survive pulls, and you still don't get 
the old situation where they were the only ones likely to know -how- to 
pull.  Can't put the worms back in the can.
