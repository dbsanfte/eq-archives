I know this fellow is a 55 SK, and that he harm touches for approximately
1k, and that it is important to clear the room of possible healers before
you spawn him...but I still have to ask the all-time-favorite
question...do folks think that a 58 ranger and shaman can take this
fellow?  I don't remember any other vital info on him, such as HP, max
hit, whether he quads, what spells he favors, and summoning...though I'm
assuming he summons. I do remember folks saying that he's "gimpy once he's
slowed", but I like something more concrete than that.
 
Because it is a nasty camp for the angry goblin, I was intending to wait
until we were 60, but I'm starting to think it'll save some hassle if we
can just nab him before the change to Droga goes live. 

And FYI, I typically have about 3300hp and 1100ac with combined ranger and
shaman buffs.
