Ohhh, the uber guild member.  We're sooo impressed.  So you can solo with 
a completely decked-out, level 60 and AA, cleric sitting off to the side 
to heal you character.  Big flaming deal!  If you can't take an uberguild 
character and solo low blues, you're pretty worthless.  Now take a level 
40 warrior, with level appropriate gear, and solo.  Compare that to a 
naked level 40 druid.

I would say that most soloing is done for experience, at least until 
you're able to farm sellables.  Of course I don't have the patience to 
spend an hour killing a yellow mob for a possible drop, I would rather 
kill 20 low blues.

And a 45 bard can keep them all dead too.  It's a specific, non-typical 
mob.  Giant mobs in the old world have tons of HP for their level, hit 
very hard, but drop very nice cash/sellable loot.  They are NOT something 
that anyone would farm for exp.  I hunted them in my 40s.  I was the only 
bard I ever saw there.  The only under50s I ever saw there were druids, 
shaman, and wizards.  Not many wizards.  So of the 14 (at the time) 
classes, how come only 4 classes were represented there?  Maybe because 
most classes couldn't solo there for exp if it were the only open spot in 
Norrath?

Now it gets better, you're describing classing kiting, and you seem to 
think you're describing some new and innovative soloing technique.  You're 
also advocating root/nuking as effecient, when nukes often breaks root.  
Are you sure you didn't ebay these accounts?

Nobody said that druids are the only classes that can solo.  In certain 
very selected instances other classes can solo better than either druids 
or necros.  However, over the course of their career, 1-60, druids and 
necros solo much better than most classes.  In either case a completely 
naked, unbuffed character can solo for exp easily.  No melee class can do 
that.  Most casters have trouble doing that.
