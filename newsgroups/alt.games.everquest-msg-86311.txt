Subject: Luclin loot level 39-45... sucky or is it me?

Netherbian has great loot for its range.  Dawnshroud, Grimling Forest, and
Tenebrous is all very blue to me.  But the loot reallllllly sucks!  Who needs
all those runes the grimlings drop and the beasts in Dawnshroud don't drop
anything worthwhile... 
Anyone found spots in Luclin that have decent loot and exp for 40 - 45 range?
