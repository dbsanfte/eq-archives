Good point.  But I'd say that for most of EQ's history it's been a
good plan to avoid playing a Knight, SOE's disfavor seems to be
quite a bit stickier than their favor.  Paladins in particular have
been and still are cursed by misperceptions fed by eye-candy (LoH
and SU, especially SU, are wa-a-a-a-a-y overvalued by the ignorant).
The really sad thing is that these misperceptions are shared by
the people who are supposed to know better by definition, it's just
pathetic how poorly the dev team understands their own game, judging
both by class balance problems and problematic content design.
