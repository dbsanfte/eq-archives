Actually no. One particular reason why every expert says that a separate 
entity should be used is that the TCPIP stack of the firewall and of the 
application machine should never be the same. This is one one of the basic 
targets to get a backdoor into the TCPIP stack. And having a combined one 
makes it easier to get one of those backdoors in (via applications which 
are installed on the machine)
