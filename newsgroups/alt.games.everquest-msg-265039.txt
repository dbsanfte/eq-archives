Heh, unfortunately I've "caught" more bugs in EQ2 after today's patch than I 
had the entire week prior since I first started.  A number of the changes 
they implemented today don't quite work right, and it looks like some of the 
quests may have been broken (though I don't know that they weren't broken 
before - such as the end of the Qeynos Citizenship quest... can't read the 
last page of my book for some reason).

Overall, I think I like the changes, though the new tradeskill icons took a 
bit of getting used to.  On yet another bug front, it appears two of the 
woodworking events have the same icon :(

And though the patch notes say that the skills should now increase upon use, 
they are still flakey.  If I use my brawling skills, I get the message that 
they have improved all right.  Along with individual messages that swimming, 
etc have improved as well.  As I commented before, this was one specific 
change they should have made more than a week and a half out from release so 
that there is time to fix all the bugs with the implementation.  It 
definitely doesn't seem to be working the way they intended.
