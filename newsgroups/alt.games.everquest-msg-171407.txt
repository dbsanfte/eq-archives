Current minimum level is 47, which allows new members to participate in a
significant portion of the raids we do.  We recently raised that from 40, as
our membership is mostly 50+ at this point.  If you do decide you want to
give it a try, you would be more than welcome to apply, if, or when, you are
47.

All that being said, it is far from perfect.  We have our squabbles, we try
to deal with it, and keep most people happy.  A couple days ago, we had to
deguild someone, first time that we have ever done that.  There have been
others before that we would likely have deguilded, but, they figured that
out on their own before it came to that, and left of their own volition.
