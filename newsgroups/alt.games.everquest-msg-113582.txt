Wish I had more luck on those rolls for loot rather than less pestering for
sow/ports now that I've basically downgraded my dru to port bitch for
moolah.

The only reason, other than luck, I can possibly think that I don't get as
pestered as some say on this NG is that my name is more like a monks.... you
know the type, jusakafistfury, whipawa, fungwhoopi etc .. (gawd 'elp those
Druids with 'treehugger' type names )
