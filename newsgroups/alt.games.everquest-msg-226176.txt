Some differences of note:

(1) +HP items affect both max HP and current HP. +STA items only affect
max HP. Non-healing classes will often take off +HP items when binding
wounds, then put them back on afterwards to get over the 50% limit. Can't
do that with +STA items.

(2) Maybe warriors get enough bang for the buck on HP from STA, but my
necro can buy a +40HP belt or a +65HP ring fairly cheaply. How much would
it cost me to buy a similar +100STA item to get the same HP out of it?
Shyeah, right!
