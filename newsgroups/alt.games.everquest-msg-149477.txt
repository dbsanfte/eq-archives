Ok I know most people just get a few points in most of the languages
just to get one more thing on their skills list but my question is if
someone like me was a master at Gnomish language listening to someone
who only has one point into it, why would it sound like giberish? I
guess since they suck at the language so much I wouldn't know what
they're trying to say, but that's the logical explaination and I'm
much more willing to believe it's a bug than Verant making sense.
