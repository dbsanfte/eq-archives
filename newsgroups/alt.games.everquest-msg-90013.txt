On my 36 druid, whenever I try quadding these things I tend to get major
problems because one or two of the four will try running away (just stopping
with snare of course) when they get low on health while the other two or
three keep chasing me.  Obviously that's not good for the AE spell, and I
never have enough mana left to just cast combust on everything left (178
wis).  I have had much better luck with cougars in Iceclad because as long
as there's more than two still alive they keep chasing me.  What did you do
to get around the problem with the runners?  Also, do you happen to know
what your played time was at 35 and/or 50?
