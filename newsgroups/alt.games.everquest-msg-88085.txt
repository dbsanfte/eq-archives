 Just the snake moving.

 It's like water drops falling off it I think. Blue sparkling mace
looking thing.

 Wizard has the sceptre thing that leave little colored dots trailing

 Mage epic is a pet

 Shaman epic is a spear with a 'halo' around it

 Beastlord hasn't been completed as of yet I dont think

 I don't think Rogue epic has an animation. None I can recall.
