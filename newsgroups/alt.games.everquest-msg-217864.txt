I assure you sir it was not an effort at a guilt trip. that did not occur to
me at the time of posting but I can see how it would be interpreted as such
now. (however it looks like you're trying to get some sympathy too judging
from your last post)

As far as you buying it or not, I could care less.

Computers are amazingly cheap these days and you dont have to try very hard
to get a decent one, and considdering how far i've let my original point get
away from all of this I wonder why im even replying to this at all.


My original post was stating that those of us who *do* have the higher end
line of computers would like to see a program that actually takes advantage
of it. right now the only thing that truely takes advantage of my processor
is video encoding.

So if you would like to continue the thread on what it was originally (if or
not the people with fast computers deserve the option for better graphics in
oldworld zones), then by all means, reply.
