And from the description... the stress test is to test the systems
under load. Don't believe it refers to stressing out the participants.

Ahh.. a WoW apologist... nice to meet you.

From what I understand.. the approach is the same, just instead of
needing 51% damage... all you gotta do is get the first tap in.

I repeat.. its way cheaper than a babysitter. $13 a month? That's what
some parents pay in a night of babysitting. They spend more than that
on groceries. Plus.. if WoW follows EQ's model... you should be able
to buy a game card for it soon enough. At which point, any argument
you had becomes a moot point.
