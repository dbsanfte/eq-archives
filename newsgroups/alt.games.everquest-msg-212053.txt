I've been back playing a couple of my high 40's low 50's twinks to relax
lately, and on my server at least, I've found the groups on average in
PoJ to suck worse than the worst KC group I've gotten. PoJ, like
HighHold before it, seems to attract the cautious players who haven't
really learned much in thier journey up in levels due to it's close zone
line for escaping when things turn bad. Post 50 my rogue leveled much
faster when he got a group in KC than even the fastest pulling PoJ
group. This may only hold true for my server though, who knows.

However, experience in KC is totally dependent on crowding, so I urge
all who don't like the place not to return.
