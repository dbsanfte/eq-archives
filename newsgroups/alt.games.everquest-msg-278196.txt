I'm no economist .. and I didn't sleep at a Holiday Inn Express last night. 
But this, in concert with the fact that they're not raising the rate on the 
All Access Pass, leads me to the belief that they're doing this to cover 
operating losses due to shortfalls in income from EQ2.

They most likely budgeted this year based on projected income from EQ2 that 
will not materialize.  Since EQ2 didn't quite pan out as expected, they're 
making up for it from the original fanbase.

At least that's my guess.
