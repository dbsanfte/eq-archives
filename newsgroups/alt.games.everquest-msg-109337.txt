Instead of waiting for Verant to release a client for linux, why not a few
developers get together and write one from scratch....To some this might
sound like a hard task, but most of the work would be redrawing all the maps
and models, the programming part shouldn't take that long.

1) The engine i propose either one of the quake engine (sense there is tones
of tutorials and map editing utilities) or really start from scratch and use
Crystal Space, the first would be faster.

2) To get the login stuff going, someone would need to convice the guys at
eqemu.org or hackersquest.org to write a dll to be loaded (sende they dont
want to release the source due to accounts might be stolen).

3) The programming part would be done by looking at these emus and seeing
what commands are sent to the client and the new client would execute them
appropaitly. After the commands are in, any mud coder should be able to add
just about anything to client and server.

4) If the first choice was used there are plenty of map editors for quake,
so than the worlds would have to be mapped, unless someone could figure out
how to extract the maps from everquest and convert them to quake format.

5) Models same as above.

6) Drag and drop menus should be added, for equipment shops, etc, icons
would need to be redrawn or extracted somehow from everquest

That should be it, and walla a working everquest linux client. The advantage
of this also is graphical improvements can be added sense it would be
opensource, so the client would never be outdated, and you could use with
the emulators to make your own game out of it.
