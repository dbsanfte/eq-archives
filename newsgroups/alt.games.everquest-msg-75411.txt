Had to buy....

GForce3 Ti Card.
Extra 500+meg of ram

Next up is more HD space/faster.

No lag now at all due to GFX etc but I do notice a weird thing when moving
using the mouse to view, all is fine looking at complicated scenes but say I
spin on the spot when the view fills with just a wall/mountain side etc. The
frame rate crawles. Only happens in EQ all other games are fine.
