Except that my HP goes up 2 points, then 5 points, then pause, then 2 
points, then 5 points, pause... there are apparantly two different 
checks being made.  Now it does turn out that both these bumps occur 
like clockwork, same interval apart every time, so there's still a 
"tick" based amount you are regenning, easy to calculate.  But it is (a 
smidgeon) trickier than you describe.

Splendid

ps yes, thats 7 hp per tic.  And those numbers aren't accurate or 
current, just an example.  I frankly haven't looked at my current regen; 
I'm a 61 gnome with 3 points in regen AA and keep the spell TPP on at 
all times.  So... 10 standing and 13 sitting?  Just guessing though.
