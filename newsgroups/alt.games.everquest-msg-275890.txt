I *really* like the Mentoring idea.  I guess it has already been done
in City of Heroes with their sidekicks...but if it were implemented in
other games too I would be ecstatic.  Not having to worry about level
differences would make it so much easier to play with my friends who
I've outleveled (or vice-versa).

It's not something that will get me back into EQ2 (although the rest of
the patch message sounds pretty cool...they need Beastlords for me to
come back)...if they added it to EQ1 though I'd probably resubscribe.
Although if WoW ever adds it I'd probably never leave.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
