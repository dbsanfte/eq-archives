MIx the two - tell group leader or whoever invited you in...'XXXX in on my
ignore list so Im afraid I cannot group, they were here first so I'll
disband now' and disband.

If they didnt tell you who was in the group before you joined thats the
first you'll know so its hardly unresonable on your part. You aren't
dropping the ultimatm of him or me....you are acting nicely. If the group
takes notice and prefers you over ignoree maybe they have saved themselves
some hassle.
