My girlfriend plays on her laptop at the moment (waiting on a motherboard
RMA to complete) which is a 512mb 1.6ghz pentium mobile with a 32mb
ATI card. It plays fine, with all the whistles turned off (very high
performance), but she takes significantly longer to zone, and suffers
'quit to desktop and restart' syndrome far more frequently than
I do on an XP3000 with 1gb of ram. 

EQ2 has a notable memory leak of some kind that means after zoning a
few times in Qeynos it starts swapping to disk like crazy. With only
512mb this happens very quickly. It takes longer for me.

One thing worth noting is I have a 256mb 6800GT and, to be honest, while
I play with all the bells and whistles we have pretty similar frame
rates - the game is no less *playable* on her system, and the core
functionality (character graphics, spell effects) are all ok.
