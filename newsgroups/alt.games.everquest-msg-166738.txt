Not at all.  My definition of a rant is "an emotionally charged and
verbose expression of opinion".  So, while fanatics are the source
of many rants, and most of the rants I have encountered have expressed
disapproval about one thing or another, neither is a requirement.

Some of my favorite rants are pure entertainment.  Take the old Church
of the SubGenius rants, at least one of which reminded us to be mindful
of: "that mysterious Pipe, able to burn through ten-foot thick Fort
Knox titanium steel doors!".  These are the words of men who wanted
nothing more than slack.  Fanatic and slack are not particularly
compatible words.  :-p
