Wow.  That's basically what my boy-droid has, though his clear visual range
ends just before his feet.  Fortunately, we've got a really good optician
here in town, and his spex rock.  He's also not big into swimming pools, so.
.  .

I'm dreadfully about the new glasses (I get them on the 30th).  Apparently,
I'll be corrected to the point that I'll be able to see 20/15.  TWENTY
FIFTEEN.  It's horrifying.  I'll be able to take down snipers with rubber
bands, see through walls, and read microprint.

I wil be a tiny human god!  MWA HA HA HA!

*ahem*  Sorry.  8)
