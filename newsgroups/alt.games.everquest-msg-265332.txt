   Darned you, Bob Perez!  Now you're got me thinking of trying it again. 
My real problem is that, well, I am really torn about buying it or not.  

   On one hand, I really like the idea of getting in on the ground floor of
the Next Big Thang.  The descriptions I have read sound intriguing, and
I've been very curious about this game since I heard about it.  Plus, it
would get me back into Norrath, after a fashion I guess.  I miss not having
that connection to my friends here in this newsgroup.

  But... I left EQLive for what I felt were very good reasons.  I had
simple burnout from playing the low to mid game so much, and didn't much
enjoy my glimpses of the high end game.  I really have a low tolerance of
"work hard to get decent equipment so I can pull my weight in a group"
requirements.  I didn't like the near constant churning out of expansions
without fixing bugs and broken quests that have been in the game since I
started.  SOE's evident "Get the most money we can from the playerbase,
while providing as minimal CS as we can" philosophy started to grate on me,
and frankly I think the folks of EQII are starting to show the same mindset
(I've thought this since they started selling the beta slots).  

   Another factor... I'm still very happy with CoH, and I have my doubts
about being able to fit two MMORPG into my life.  Aside from just plain
being fun, CoH doesn't have the strikes against it that SOE does from my
point of view.

   Hmm... yeah.  I did live with the one character thing on FV, though we
did break down and buy a third account.  But still.. I could play as many
characters as I wanted on other servers.  I hope they listen to you,
because this might still be a deal breaker for me.
