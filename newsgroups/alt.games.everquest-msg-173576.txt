This is something a lot of people can't seem to understand.  I've heard a
lot of people say, "The terrorists only attack you because you're messing
with them!  Stop doing things they don't like and they'll quit blowing shit
up!"

While this is probably true, it's (1) weak and pathetic, and (2) extremely
shortsighted.

If you just let people do whatever they want, no matter how wrong, just so
they won't hurt *you*, you're being pathetically self-serving, you're doing
precisely what millions of Europeans did when Hitler was in power, which of
course just made him that much more powerful.

If someone blows you up and you immediately do what they want so they won't
do it again, well, sure, they'll quit blowing you up.  But the *next* time
you do something they don't like, they'll think, "Well, we know how to deal
with these people!  All you have to do is blow them up and they'll do what
you want!"  And you'll get blown up again, idiot.  Now, of course, you could
just spend all your time figuring out what to do to make everyone happy, but
I for one don't want America to be a slave to terrorists.  In any case it
wouldn't work because no matter what we do, we're going to piss someone off
simply because we're so big and powerful.  Unless, of course, we take
Malcolm's ingenious advice and blow *ourselves* up!
