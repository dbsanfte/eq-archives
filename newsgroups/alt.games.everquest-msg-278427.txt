Up to level 60, Druids get Shield of Blades, 32 DS, and the ancient spell, 
Ancient: Legacy of Blades, 36 pt DS.  (Mind you, the number of people with 
the ancient version is rather low.

Mages get Aegis of Ro, 33 pt DS.

So, while Druids did have a better DS available in theory, in practice, 
mages had the best DS.

With OOW, Druids get a 55 pt DS, Circle of Nettle (group) or Nettle Shield 
(single).

Mages get Circle of Fireskin, a 62 pt DS.  They also get an AA for a huge 
very short duration DS (3 ticks at 400ish as I recall).
