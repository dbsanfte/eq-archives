Nother option if you are light race and class, is find an empty bandit
camp or 3 in Karana's.  They are never "all" camped.  They are pale
green to you, they drop sashes and bronze,  can make upwards of 350pp a
night, hit the Bears too, skins are good loot, go till you are
encumbered, carry 1 stack each muffins and milk.
