Lately, our guild has been tearing itself apart over 1.5 epics.  Everyone
wants to get three groups together to take down some epic fight, and
spamming our guildleader about getting help.  He's about ready to give up
the game over it, and meanwhile people are either irritated as hell over the
people spamming guildchat for epic help, or whining about how unappreciated
they are because of the lack of help they're getting.

I myself have given up on my 1.5 epic for now just because we simply don't
have the resources to deal with everyone's epics and I don't want to be part
of the problem.  I'm willing to wait a month of two - but many others are
not.  It's a nightmare for our officers who have to deal with stressed out
people on both sides.

They're trying to put together some sort of plan now.  While they're doing
that, I wanted to pose the question myself: how is your guild dealing with
the many many people who all want help with their epics?
