Please state WHY it couldn't be done in this case.

You didn't state your PC specs, or how much the vidcap software gobbles
up system resources. Eq run in a window allows a LOT of room for
multitasking. I didn't suggest a shutdown scheduler because I didn't
deem in necessary to close down EQ, based on experience of seeing EQW at
work.

You were being pissy. You presented a result you were trying to achieve,
I offered a solution. It wasn't doing it YOUR way, but it held a strong
possibility of achieving the end result. You dismissed it without having
the faintest clue whether or not it would work, and being completely
unwilling to look at alternative solutions other than your clumsy forced
crash.

Your intention was ultimately NOT to simply shut down EQ, but to run
VidCap a certain amount of time after leaving the PC with EQ running. I
came to that conclusion BY DEFINITION from reading the entire post,
rather than simply the first line. Where did you come to the conclusion
that it wouldn't work?

Sorry, I've been busy. Didn't think that trying to help would tie me
into 24/7 customer support ):o/

Or maybe they figured that the person would actually TRY the solution
they offered?
