Wow prices really vary in EQ.  I did manage to find a compass at a tent type
merchant near the docks of Oeynos, and paid 1gold, 2 silver, and some
copper, thought it was a good deal, hopefully it will come in handy when Im
lost, I generally go out the gates into the wild, and turn towards the gates
and check my compass, if it says north, then I know that I have to go north
to eventually get back to the town, though I would imagine that if you go
really of course say to the west or east instead of south and then return
north, you could miss the town all together.

Whats this about binding the sense heading  to the forward walk/run key? How
does one do that?
