Finally, after half a year of doing tradeskills (mostly tailoring), huge 
piles of pp spend on getting my tradeskills up, and a LOT of time spend 
on getting the quest items, i finally managed to make the 7th Coldain 
Prayer Shawl.

So if you see a happy wood elf druid in Veeshan running around asking 
people to inspect her to see her shoulders, its just me.

And for the ones of you who dont know the Coldain Prayer Shawls, here 
are the stats on the 7th (and so far last) one:

Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl: +7 AC +7 Sta +7 Wis +7 Int +7 Cha +7 Save vs 
Fire +7 Save vs Cold +7 Save vs Poison, Effect: Flowing Thought I
