Yep, finally petitioned a name.

Chanter calling himself Mezzmer.  Why, cuz he's a jerk that's why.  Am I a
petty SOB, you betcha!  Do I feel bad?  Nope.

Here's the story:  the server is Firiona Vie.

I'm in a group of orc hunters at Highpass, he comes and joins the half group
that we were sharing the place with.  We fight, he charms.  Charm breaks,
his folks kill it.  He did that a few times, this not only makes our casters
waste mana, its KSing us for the kills.  Our wizard dispells his next pet
and they get two orcs pounding on them.  They survive -- darn the luck.

He threatened to petition the wizard for trying to kill him.  So fine, he
wants to play that game, we petitioned that he was KSing and got one of our
members killed when he charmed one an orc we were fighting and our casters
ran OOM on his pet.  Nothing happened that we could see.

From then it got nasty, fights turned into a FFA on every pull, he charmed,
we broke charm, everyone started bitching.  Our chanter (who didn't charm
anything) decided he's had enough and disbands.  The wizzy disbands in a
huff and gates.  The rest of the group still wants to stay, but since we
already had the halberd for our warrior, I didn't want to.  I left also.

I get on today and while medding for a fight, sees "Mezzmer casts a spell"
on text.  GRRRRR!!!!  /Petition...
