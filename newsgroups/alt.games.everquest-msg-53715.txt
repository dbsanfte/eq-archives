I have never seen one but I know others that have. Any knight of high enough
level has a chance to weld the sword. When I got mine we had a group of 2
SKs and a Shaman. The Shaman and I were around 45 and the other SK was 39.
We went to the room where the zone in is for Chardok and there was a level
55 monk that helped us or we never would have been able to pull it off. Got
2 swords from there in about an hour.
