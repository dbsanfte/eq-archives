Well I was asking for a port (my warrior has a hard time getting one, KOS in
freeport and no guild at the time) and some level 50+ druid or something was
camping something or another in WC. I gave him a tell (yes I do it when I
dont get a responce from a /ooc) he said he would do it if I gave him
50plat. 50 Fin plat? For god sakes, the most any mob at that level I fought
was about 5 - 10 plat. Split that with my group...He then said I normally
charge 70. I told him that was a lot...He said "Time is money man."

People like that make me sick, like its REAL money. I think it can be
annoying so go /anon if it bugs you that much. Its only mana am I not
getting something? Is it that important to casters? *sniff* warriors have it
hard when they have to travel on foot with no j-boots =p
