that's you and a few others.  in my experience (three years of playing
on a variety of servers) you are in a small minority.  the overwhelming
majority of casters ignore public requests, while only a tiny minority
ignore a politely worded /tell that is:
1) sent to them when they are not engaged in combat, and
2) includes an offer of compensation (complementary buffs, pp, peridots,
& etc.)

for you.

The best way I have to gauge what other people think is by observing
their actions.  /ooc, /shout, & /auc are mostly ignored.  /tell to a
toon I can see is resting produces favorable results nearly every time,
and occassionally introduces me to a new friend.

You few who rant here about "unsolicited /tells" are only a tiny
minority, even if the those who ignore a direct tell (usually due to
being AFK, or so they tell me in the apologetic /tell i usually get
10 minutes later) are added to your numbers.
