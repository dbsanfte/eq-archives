You know how it is, take 2, 3 ,4 5 etc groups to a raid, only one group
gains the exp off kills.

in the eqstr_en.txt file and RIGHT next to the new petition command lines is
this:

5059 %1 joined the raid
5060 %1 is already in a raid.
5061 You formed a raid.
5062 You were removed from the raid.
5063 %1 has left the raid.
5064 You invite %1 to join your raid.
5065 %1 invites you to join a raid.
5066 %1 is currently considering joining another raid.
5067 To join the raid...
5068 %1's name changed to %2
5069 You are now the leader of the raid.
5070 %1 is now the leader of your raid.
5071 Your raid was disbanded.
5072 %1 was not assigned leadership.
5073 Only the leader of the raid can invite someone.
5074 To invite someone to your raid, you must first target them.
5075 Only player characters can be in a raid.
5076 You cannot invite yourself to the raid.
5077 That person is already in your raid.
5078 You cannot join the raid because %1 is either linkdead or is not in the
zone. 5079 You notify %1 that you agree to join the raid.
5080 You declined the invitation to join %1's raid.
5081 %1 rejected your offer to join the raid.
5082 %1 is not in your raid.
5083 You have joined the raid.
5084 A member of the group of the person you are inviting to the raid is out
of range. The invite has failed.

looks like this is going live soon

Be especially good for 2 groups mini raids to Deep or SSra for drops and
spells )
