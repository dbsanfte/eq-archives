I've had a few times when people disagreed; usually we went with group vote,
and they'd be sports about it, but sometimes it gets ugly.

Oone time, this guy we added to a pickup LDON group was dissenting, and he
was *so* persistent about it that we dropped him before getting an
adventure.  The other 5 agreed to NBG, he said he'd give in, but then
everything out of his mouth for 5 minutes--in group and in PM--was about how
NBG was bad.  Even after we disbanded him, he kept sending PMs!  We put him
on all ignore.

He does not represent all those who're GBN, though, we know, but the GBN
people seem to be more...fanatical about it somehow?  Really, really intent
on driving things home about how GBN is more fair?

What gets me is when people say NBG is selfish.  Yeah...  It's really
selfish to say I only want to roll on the items that are an upgrade to me.
Which may be none.
