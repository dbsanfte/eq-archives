You'd be surprised. Consider cases where you are killing n mobs in a 
cycle. Adding one extra mob to the cycle often involves breaking the 
next room or something, and allows a room you'd been holding to repop, 
forcing you to re-break it... further slowing you down.

If your doing LDoNs in a 5 hour play session and can do 5 of them in 5 
hours including recruiting, travel, and split etc. Getting a 2% boost to 
your output isn't going make the least bit of difference... at best 
you'll finish the evening 2% faster...that's 6 minutes. What are you 
going to do with the extra 6 minutes? Rush to WoS to kill one mob?

In fact, the only time you'd really see anything is in a scenario where 
someone is pulling from unlimited single pullable mobs over a long 
period of time. (e.g. like spending a day in an OT group) There if your 
killing mobs 2% faster you might see 2% more mobs over time. However, 
even there its not gauranteed..... if you get, to use your example 45 
minutes of killing before someone goes AFK and you need to break to add 
someone etc... and you were killing one mob a minute. A 2% increase in 
killing power doesn't even get you one extra mob before the group breaks 
down!! No xp gain at all.

Given how few AAs translate to straight % increase, and considering that 
even good AAs are only situationally useful (e.g. Adding even 1000 hps 
to someone who isn't tanking could make no difference at all)...

Of course.

Consider this: you'd typically gain more by swapping in a shield between 
2hs swings for the extra bash attack. Its rarely worth the effort 
though. And its a far bigger boost to your effectiness than getting some 
AA a couple hours earlier.

Perhaps they just don't want put up with grinding and the mind numbing 
tedium that "playing the game effectivly" entails.

Anyone that argues against a split because its "more effective" has no 
business outside of a PL group in a hotspot. If being "more effective" 
is the pinnacle to which you strive, your damaging your "effectiveness" 
orders of magnitude more by leaving your PL spot for more than 10 
minutes than you would ever gain from picking up some AA a couple hours 
earlier.

Not understanding the game has *nothing* to do with your attitude 
towards xp progression.

1) You can not understand the game and be fixated on moving your xp bar 
(and presumably be terrible at it and likely end up with the power 
levellers because it seems safest).

2) You can not understand the game and not care about xp progression 
(and spend 2 years not cracking 35th level as you wander around 
exploring and dieing). 

3) You can understand the game and care about xp progression (now you 
are one of those powerlevellers mentioned above. in a safe place where 
mobs only melee, don't hit hard, have lower than average hitpoints, back 
to the zoneline in a zone with a good xp modifier, preferably with a 
tank who is twinked and buffed to the hilt....)

4) And you can understand the game and not care about xp progression. 
(These are the people doing 3 man ldons at 45, duoing the fire giants at 
50th, half grouping the depths of Acrylia Caverns or The Deep at 55... 
etc etc... they do things most people haven't done, at levels most 
people wouldn't try doing them because "There's better/faster/easier xp 
elsewhere"...be it OT or BoT or WoS or Fire or whatever

> The "dangerous" encounters in the game aren't being done by
> the "laid-back" players, right?

That might be true if "laid back" meant "inept" that isn't the case so 
this is wrong. "Laid back about xp progression" doesn't mean "failure to 
understand the game".

FWIW I'm not saying you are wrong about the theoretical advantages of 
not splitting. They do exist. I'm just saying its practically 
irrelevant. And its noteworthy the types of personality that make a big 
deal about minmaxing such a minor advantage.

Like I said, if your concerned about minmaxing to the degree that you'll 
actually critisize or mock people who split then you better be in your 
PL grouping swapping your shield out every other swing, because those 
are much more effective at boosting your effectivness than where you've 
set your split at...

If you don't want to run a split, fine. I have no issue with that. And 
I'm not even saying it says anything about you. Its only when you making 
a *big deal out of it* that it becomes ridiculous. And declaring that 
players who don't care about a miniscule effectiveness bost must not 
understand the game is even more so. 

Particularly given that racing up to 70 as effectively as possible and 
then grinding out AAs as effectively as possible skips so much of the 
game that calling it the most effective way to play is outright silly. 
By that token reading the chapter titles and the final pages of a book 
is the most effective way to read a novel.
