 Emperor key farming in Ssra is good for this. General/Advisor/Arbiter
in particular. Single pulls but normally a few extra clerics around so
losing mine isn't a huge setback. They hit rather hard so most times
tanks can't get them off the cleric before the cleric drops.

 I don't hate my clerics. But they do need to learn how to handle
healing while in a pull group. Ssra is a good place for a quick lesson.
I'd rather them learn there then on some other raid where the same
mistake could cause a wipe and possibly a blown spawn. For example,
getting us AoW before we're ready.
