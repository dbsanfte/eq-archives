It's my understanding that with all skills there's a possibility that a
critter will win a roll.  I'd say that if you're indiff then you've got a
100% chance of being indiff for a few more seconds, then they get another
skill check.  I really haven't heard of cases where sneak has been seen
through because of skill checks, but ya never know.  Critters that should
have conned indiff to me with no reason or way to have gained See Invis have
attacked me before.  Not often, but once every couple months probably.
