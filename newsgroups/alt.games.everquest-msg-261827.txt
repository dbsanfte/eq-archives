Haven't played for a week or so and log on and download a lot of files.
Starting the game i get a message saying that my videodrivers for my
Geforce 3 Ti 500 (driver 5672) need to be updated to version 6177.

Ok - then i go to Nvidias site and get the driver - but when i run install
it says that the drivers has not been approved for Win XP.

So, is it recommended to install or not ?

Kim
