Oh, but I *love* halflings :) Got one myself! I do actually have a bigger
and probably better map, in the book I bought about the movie. In fact, I
know one is there, and I also know I need to look at it, it just isn't
"handy" when I'm reading the paperbacks! Ok, will go to the local library
and see if no one has pinched the other Tolkien stuff ;) (just ribbing you!)
and see if I can't find that scene, as well as read up some on "local"
history  :)

thanks!
Dark
