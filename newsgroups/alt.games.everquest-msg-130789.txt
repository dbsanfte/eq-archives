I think it's wonderful !! After a certain level friend  Druid,  porting others 
at their request or demand, becomes very very annoying.  It may be a  slight
money maker for you  when you first get your group port spells but that will
last only for a few levels.  Remember the time spent porting otehrs is time
spent NOT getting experience or getting those nice loot drops in, for example
CC.
