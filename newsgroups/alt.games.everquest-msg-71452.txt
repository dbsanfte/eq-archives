What I did was hit track, see the BM up and /ooc asking if anyone was using
her, and that if they weren't, I was going to begin the leggings quest in a
few minutes and to please not attack the BM or named giants, then I repeated
the warning that I was about to start the quest every 1-2 minutes.

Then, when my guildie got into the zone  (she had been off killing ry'gorr)
I /ooc'd that I was handing in the harness and BM on her way, then I /ooc'd
again when she got out of the caves, then again about halfway to the fort
(BTW, don't worry if it looks like she's headed up the wrong side from the
valley with the broken spires in it, she has some odd pathing there).

A couple people sent me tells to ask if they could hit it for faction, I
told them all sure but to stand back from the fort until the BM gets engaged
and we start killing Fergul, to avoid bugs.

BM starts on Grakl, we yank Fergul, druid starts root rotting, I try to hit
him with Fury of Air, get 2 resists and say screw it, hit my guildie with a
Gheal and Regen, just in case,  let the guys take their faction poke,
including a level 60 shaman that poked it with his epic.

I notice Grakl died and the BM wandered off down to the wizzy spire valley
and is just  hanging down there, Fergul is at about 33% health, bugs cross
my mind but don't seem to be happening, root breaks on Fergul, but he's
snared so me and my guildie (who already has Kromrif Leggings) just go up
and beat on it with our Dark Embers, she procs like mad and I don't (too low
level for the useless proc), he falls right over on top of me, I right click
and loot them (even get exp =P) and thank the zone.

The warrior that poked him for faction advises me to camp out real quick to
save them just in case, since a guildie of his lost skyshrine leggings when
he went LD right after questing them.

I camp out, and back in  (45 seconds total on my new computer  =P)  run to
Thurgadin since I had been at the giant fort, SoW some naked barbarian
standing there, and hit him with a regen, he thanks me and then the GMs spam
the world with a broadcast of  "WORLD COMING DOWN EVERYONE LOG OUT NOW!!", I
camp.

That's it.  I have my pretty new leggings.  Which for some odd reason have
more AC than my BP (Ulthork).

And now, 200 wisdom without my old expensive boots.  All I have is cultural
on my feet now.

Although now I want to get a Nightshade Wreath just to get rid of my nasty
looking bicycle helmet.
