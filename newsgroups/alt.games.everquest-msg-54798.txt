Heheh that sounds like it would be fun, though had more than enough
downtime as it was in the EK events as KS was so rampant that i found my
druid playing more a ranger/wizard role in that i was going toe to toe
with the mobs in melee as well as nuking them as soon as my dd spell
ungreyed.  Was running out of mana usually after two kills sometimes
more depending on the mob in question.  I never went to the Rathe
events, as it sounded like everyone was saying the mobs were so tuff
that i wouldn't have been able to kill anything.  I had already eaten
one death earlier in the day when i crested a hill only to run into the
Werewolf overlord.  I also got lucky late last night when I got jumped
by dragoon Zytl in WC.  I did a who to see if any clerics were near by
as I had gone from 4 blues to level out of 31 to less than two yellows
into the level after dying to zytl.  I sent the only non anon cleric in
zone a tell asking if I could donate for a rez.  He wouldn't take a
donation, got a level 56 rez for free.  Thanks again Dryn of Kreiglords
on Erollisi Marr I really appreciate the rez.  That rez and the Wisdom
belt I got made my night for me.
