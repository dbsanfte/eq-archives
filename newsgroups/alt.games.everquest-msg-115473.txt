I'm sure they do want that ability in there.  It's handy for ToV and
DN raids and the few people that actually hunt in WW, of course.
That doesn't mean I'm not surprised that they made it easy to
bypass a zone that's an obvious bottleneck on the ability of people
to easily get to those zones or that they haven't 'nerfed' the exploit
simply by moving the safe spot to the CS side.

Siren's Grotto is obviously designed as a bottleneck on people
moving easily to WW, DN, and ToV.   There's simply no easy way
through it except for those spells unlike almost every other
pass-through zone in the game.   I'm not saying I think it ~should~
be changed, just that I'm surprised they put in a bypass for
getting through it that's trivial for any raiding party moving through
it.  After all, it's not like the people going through it won't have a
port class around anyway...
