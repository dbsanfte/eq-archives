Anyone know anything about this quest ( The Sword of Nobility) Just
wondering cause my 23 RNG was running through NK the other night and found a
new beach bum (NPC).  Talked to him a moment and gave me info on a Sword of
Nobility quest.  I've asked around a group of friends and have heard little
from them regarding even knowing about this quest.  Any help as always is
appreciated.  Thanks again.

Fred
