hehe been there... solod specs before and broke frenzy with group of 5 when
i was level 39
was lucky to get in there, and I didnt see that place again for a few
levels.. We held the room up with magi for over an hour though, then
everyone went to bed
Grouping does get boring after a while though, Im only having fun when there
are overpulls, other than that I pretty much just buff every 15 mins and mez
every now adn then
