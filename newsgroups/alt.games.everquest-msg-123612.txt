Stun is a non damage spell.  Holy Might does damage. Do damage break
mez.  Don't do damage don't break mez.  Unless the change you
speak of has gone in in the past three days or so, this rule is still in effect.

You can Stun, Root (non damaging roots, druids need not apply) remove
buffs via Cancel line, apply negative buffs such as Slow...  All these will
get you aggro but not break mez.   For young paladins working as MA
I highly reccomend stun and flash of light as incredibly short cast high
aggro non mez breakers, or if you are more desperate Root, which costs
more and has some freaky effects, but usually wears off before the
mob gets around to running.  High level paladins do similar things with
their spells but I"m not privvy to exactly which ones work best on a
limited mana budget.

As a cleric, I now have what, 7 stuns, but only Stun and Stun Command
are non damage producing... guess which two get memmed the most
often?

Aye it is conceivable that the MT (or Sponge) is not the MA... but I
wasn't introducing such rare and improbable tactics to the discussion
at the time

Heh, been on more than one raid where we run clean out of designated
tanks and the cleric channel is full of "who do we CHeal?" shouts.
Unfortunately
this is usually sign of an approaching Wipe.
