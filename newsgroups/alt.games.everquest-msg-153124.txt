It was explained in a thread I read somewhere, that if you are grouped with
higher level players that they will take the higher percentage of the
experience if they are fighting MOBS that are dark blue or higher
(yellow/red to you), but if they are fighting greenies (dark blue and up to
you) then the lower level player will get a high percentage of experience.
This may also be true for light blues but I'm not sure.
