Yes, many people note a sharp increase in proc rate with a large increase in
dex.  This doesn't address the issue being discussed here, though, which is
that some people report more procs over time with haste, and others report the
same procs per minute rate regardless of haste.

If there is a seperate proc timer, then this might, perhaps, explain these
results.

Well the simplest models don't account for some of the odd effects people
report, which suggests that there is more going on than we are identifying,
although the quirky RNG can easily account for some of this, until a large
backlog of test results are compiled.

This is interesting, but as you see elsewhere in the thread, could be explained
within this suggested proc system if the proc timer resets, and then you get to
check proc on both your regular and double attack.  You'd have to hit the
lottery for this to happen; normal proc, double attack, and double attack proc
all working same time.

If this is the case, then you'd have cases:

Normal attack procs, double attack fails, no check for double proc
Normal attack procs, double attack works, double proc fails
Normal attack procs, double attack works, double proc success
Normal attack proc fails, double attack fails, no check for double proc
Normal attack proc fails, double attack works, double proc fails
Normal attack proc fails, double attack works, double proc success
Plus you might have times when proc isn't ready yet, so no check on either
normal or double attack.

If procs are infrequent, then you'd logically get double proc pretty rarely.
If this is the case, handing the weapon to someone with the same attack values
but no double attack skill would see a reduction in proc frequency (say monk
hands proccing weapon to same level beastlord) as there would be no double
attacks to check for proc.
