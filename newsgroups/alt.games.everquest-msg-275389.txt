I think the new bazaar is terrible. One reason I've heard from SoE for
changing it was to lower the lag in the zone. With the hide traders option,
lag was almost non-existant already. Not only that but the fact that so many
people have quit EQ, the lag was lowered dramatically from that already
also.

Back in the day I remember Karana hitting the cap of 500 and having to keep
trying to get my vendor up. I think they upped the cap to 550 or 600?
Anyways, lately there might be in the neighborhood of just over 200 vendors.
