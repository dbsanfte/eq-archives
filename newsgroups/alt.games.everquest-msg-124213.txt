Hill Giants in Rathe Mts. Great source of Plat soloable for a 50 pally I
would think no exp. Genoids in Crystal Caverns also Soloable some exp. Ice
Giants in Everfrost decent exp good Plat but for a Pally I don't think you
can solo. Also side note Iksar BP and Devine Purpose is almost as good as a
Fungi and a whole lot cheaper I personally don't like the neg stats on the
Fungi and only use it after the fight while healing.
