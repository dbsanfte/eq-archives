I agree.  My 12, soon to be 13, year old step-daughter plays with me.  I
started a char just to play with her.  When my char died below 10, it was
just a "oh, well".  I she died, you would have thought I slapped her (of
course , it was all my fault).  She hated it.  Now, she almost refuses to
exp hunt because she's afraid to die.  Also, her priorities are a bit odd in
that her whole goal is to get a horse.  To that end, she saves every piece
of trash she finds to sell to a vendor (even rusty dagers and rapiers for
their few silver), which weighs her down and makes it easier for her to die
because she can't get away and can't keep up when we run.
