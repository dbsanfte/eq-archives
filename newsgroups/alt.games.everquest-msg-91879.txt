Simply applying the standard requirement that the burden of proof lies
with the positive claim. Since you don't seem to grasp the concept,
I've been trying to couch it in very simple terms for you.

What is it with you simpletons who take so much umbrage at the fact
that you're not the first participant here?

We're not "self appointed" regulars - we're regulars. By definition.
No appointment necessary.

The only ones who ever pretend there is any authority attached to
being a regular is you mopes who decide you don't like the regulars.

As for our "precious territory", we're well aware that it's a public
forum, and no one owns it. That means that when some idiot (like you)
says something stupid, anyone else (including the regulars) can point
out that you're an idiot. Free medium, and all that good stuff. 

If you can't cope with the realities of Usenet, maybe you should go
back to your Blue's Clues web board.
