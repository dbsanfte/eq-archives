I was in Runnyeye the other nite and a weird thing happened to me. There was
a L22 SK that had gotten charmed by something down below, a Mindripper
maybe. His partner got killed in like 45 seconds and then he got charmed.
After getting charmed, the SK came and started hacking on me, L27 pally.
Well he wasn't really hurting me. I saw that he was LD and so I knew this
was not an attack on purpose. I rooted and lulled him for a good 2 minutes
I'd say. Never once hacked him back. I could have zoned, but I was able to
keep him on me and from attacking anyone else who may not have been able to
fight him as well. Finally he logged back in and was back under the control
of the player. He apologized profusely and was really sorry that happened. I
told him not to worry about it. I wasn't in any real danger and that it
happens.
My question is this, in that situation, should he have disc like that or
should he have stayed in and waited for the charm to wear off? When I have
gotten charmed down there, it never lasted more than a few seconds. Due to
the fact that he went LD, did the game keep the charm going longer as is
normal for a LD person to go on auto-pilot? He really didn't hurt me over 2
minutes, but I can see how he could have been trouble for others.
Thanks in advance.
