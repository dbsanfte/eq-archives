That's all fine and dandy, but what's wrong with taking in lower
characters and newer players as well and mentoring them between raids?
You would have the same uber-characters as you would without them, and
a lot more potentially great contributors, given a little time. I'm
not talking PL and twinking them, I'm talking training them on the
lower raids along the way so they'll be more competent by the time
they get to the uber-raids. A guild that balances "playing to win",
"playing for fun", and "playing to help others" *IS* possible, and
would be a better guild than one focused on just one of those goals.
