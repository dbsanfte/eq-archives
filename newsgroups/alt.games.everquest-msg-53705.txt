    Of course you can. But leaving a necro parked at the entry to the zone
works for most places, whether there's full spoilers or not. That is what I
meant by planning - planning for failure. "If we get smoked, um, what then?"

    Bind the rogue in GFay, he can pull all the bodies out. Make sure you
have at least one cleric who is revive-capable either camped at zone, or
