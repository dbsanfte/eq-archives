I see you were wise enough not to dispute any of what I posted.

That is to security as a biologist is to a Dr.

You mean,"thrurough".

Your lack of knowledge is showing through. This has nothing to do with
"script". And the reason it is not being done more is because the majority of
internet traffic is boring to others, coupled with the fact that to most
hackers, someone's game account is as "valuable" as their hotmail password--not
worth the effort.

However, to someone who focuses on EQ accounts, it is easy for them to download
the software from a cracker site and snatch away.

OK, clarify what you said--is it easy or hard for someone to hack your
Everquest info? If you claim easy, then we are in agreement. If you say hard,
start refuting that long and detailed post I wrote instead of merely insulting
and snipping it.

True. I have always had problems with people who tell others false information.

Clarify as I asked above, then we either have the debate spelled out, or no
debate.
