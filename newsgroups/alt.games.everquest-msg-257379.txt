Blazing elementals is a long camp (or can be). If you are just waiting
for the BEs to spawn, you can occupy the waiting time by making a
circuit and whacking all the goblins in the tunnels nearby. It will
fill the time and get you stuff to sell to the gnome merchant -- might
as well make up the cost of a KEI, etc. -- and keep you occupied.

Since the elementals qualify as summoned (right?) you can try and use
the Sense Summoned spell to identify all summoned critters (when the
BEs are dead, I usually got some gnomish conjuror's pet) and you might
pick up if the Lava Elemental is up. After going around and around
wiping BEs and goblins, I picked up the LE with the spell (or was it
hearing something through the rock, anyway I was working up Divination
anyway) and when I whacked it, it dropped the Power of Fire.

Good luck.
