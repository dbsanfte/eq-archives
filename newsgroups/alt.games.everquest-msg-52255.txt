Scowling = Mobs will go out of their way to kill you once in agro range
unles they're VERY green

Threatening = Mobs will kill you if you stick around for more than a few
seconds. Very unsafe and unpredictable. You can sometimes run right past
them, but it's a large risk. Can't buy/sell/quest

Dubiously = You won't get attacked, but you also can't buy/sell

Above that you can buy/sell at increasingly better prices, and more
quests will be available, right up to 'ally'
