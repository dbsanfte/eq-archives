depends on the class you're power levelling.

melee = hands down, Shaman. you don't need the damage shield of the druid
because you can dish it out yoruself and you NEED to be doing that because
as a melee, if your skills are not kept up, it's gonna be real hard when you
stop PLing.  Tha shaman buffs are second to none, and with their SLOW and
ROOT, it's easy as 1,2,3.  having a druid with DS would probably be faster,
but then once you get higher levels and start taking a real beating the
druid will have lots of downtime because of healing.  I'm doing this now
with a shaman, and thanks to 3 spells, there is virtually no downtime at
all - and that is WITHOUT the shaman having KEI.  Those 3 spells are the
SLOW spell, chloroplast (regen) and quickness.

with those three, I rarely get hit and when I do, the chloro keeps my health
up.  plus the shaman has a pet that can handle adds if need be, as well as
some NASTY DoT's for those (unexpected) trains.

with the PoP books, travel isn't an issue either, and that;s another thing
the druid kinda loses in the equation.

BUT, if you are playing a class that can't hit the broad-side of a barn at
point blank range and IS going to take a pounding regardless, I would say
Druid - simply for the damage shield.  high level druid pulls a group of
monsters and stands there while you AE damage the mob to death or if they
turn on you, the druid can DS you and heal you.

if you had to choose one though, I'd go for Shaman.
