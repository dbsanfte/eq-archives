I've never done much hunting in the Hole, but my understanding is that
you'll still need to use Sneak/Hide.  Some mobs hate you no matter what.

The latter.  Nice feature if you ask me; it's possible to save someone's
like by mezzing the mob they're attacking while LD.

Well, my recollection is fuzzy, but the story is that this was an Erudite
city that opened up a doorway to the Plane of Underfoot, releasing all those
earth elementals and whatnot that destroyed the city.  Deep in the Hole you
find a locked door that leads to the the Plane of Underfoot.  There is no
key for the door, and there was much speculation that it would become
unlockable when PoP came out.  Alas that this hasn't proven to be the case
so far.

There's another story about how exactly the Hole was created, but I don't
remember it.

Cool story.  I love reading that kind of stuff.
