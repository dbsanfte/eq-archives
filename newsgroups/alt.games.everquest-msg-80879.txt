Yep. That's helpful advice. Took us a while to get used to it. Tiru's
messages is something to the effect of "Complete heal incoming for %t.
Please be patient."

Of course my patience, on occasion, will last longer than my remaining
health. ;-)   But that hasn't happened in a long time. Once a cleric
masters the art of the CHeal they are Gods in post fifty xp grinding
groups. Particularly with some lighter, fast casting heals available for
emergency measures and to keep the dress wearers alive.
