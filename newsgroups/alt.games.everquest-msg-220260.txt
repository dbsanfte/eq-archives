Aha, now I start to see what really happened.  Of course Annie is
too high level to get exp off kittens.  But if she was PLing
Lenny 2.0 and happened to see a batch of green to her, red to you
mobs... probably didn't even have to lull to single pull, just
use her level (and a can of tender vittles)

Did Lenny 2.0 level up, is the real question!
