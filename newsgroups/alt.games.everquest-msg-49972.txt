Your weight affects you at 15 and over.  So anything 15 and over is bad.

Personally I wouldn't drop points into mend, safe fall, sneak or any of your
monk special attacks (except for the one point you spend to get it) Just use
those all the time.  With safe fall, find a small ledge that if you fall off
you don't take that much damage and run off it then repeat. (like the entrance
to Befallen or the e commons tunnel ent.)  while you're doing that, just sneak
and sense heading and use mend when it pops up.  If you have a really high dex
those skill will start going up fast.  (I'm level 14 with 104 dex and i believe
my skills are maxed out for my level already)
