Well, if nothing else I'm learning a lot of things I didn't know
about the high-end game from all the outraged responses to VI's
plans.  It'll suck if Mages end up as "undesirables" because of
this, but from some of the other posts it seems like that is far
from certain at this point.  Also, I agree that it would make more
sense to "fix" AC and add more Plate gear that is superior to the
all/all stuff instead of "fixing" Monks.  But these changes haven't
gone live yet, so perhaps VI will alter them somewhat before the
patch.

[hmmm, here's another bad idea they could screw up:  items with a
"Recommended Class" that provided lesser benefits to others, like
plate armor that worked best for Warriors, not quite as well for
Knights, and least effective for Cleric/Bard... or blunt weapons
that were a tad faster in a Monks hands, or ...]
