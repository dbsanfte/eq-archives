Well for one thing, one of our most infamous and annoying former guild
members from the Terris-Thule server moved there and has a 55 warrior (he
hops on our allied guild channel every now and then to cause tension).  His
name is Fliznax.  No idea of race for the character on Venril, but unless
he's changed his attitude or severly improved his game play I would suggest
avoiding him.  Unless you really like rude, perverse comments and general
my-equipment/race/class-is better than yours-penis-waving.

Sorry, just saw what server you were talking about and HAD to make that
comment.  Wondering if Fliznax=Martin and I'm about to put my foot in my
mouth.  :)
