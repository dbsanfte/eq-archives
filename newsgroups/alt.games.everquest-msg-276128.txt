EQ1 - played since before the release. I liked the game, still do, but I 
never thought it was 'exciting' to lose my corpse. Combat (at 11 like you 
are talking) never had any real excitement except from adds, you pretty much 
knew within the first 15 - 30 seconds if you were going to live or die as 
well.
EQ2 played it for the first month (wife did not like it and WoW came out and 
she liked that) it was more exciting battle wise with the HO's as you 
explained, but again I could usually tell if I was going to win sans adds 
within the first 15 - 30 seconds as well.
WoW still playing it, warrior & rogue more exciting that EQ2/EQ1, building 
up rage to do that move to save you, building up combo points to do that 
move to save you, you really don't know how it will turn out (well 11 and 
under you usually do, but if you get some luck shots in on the rogue, or 
lots of rage on the war you can change the out come).

I disliked the sharing of exp loss in EQ2, there are too many boneheads out 
there, and yes I could play only with people I know, but then I never meet 
anyone new. EQ1 I hate naked corpse runs, they just suck, they are not fun, 
and they do not make the game more fun (if they required you to get to your 
corpse before you could earn xp, but you had all your equipment, THEN it 
COULD be fun). WoW's death penalty is more monetary in nature, you have to 
repair your equipment, never any xp loss.
I think there could be a nice compilation of all 3 of these models.

For people that started EQ1 they will always remember the good times, and 
tend to forget the bad. People may think that loosing there corpse in the 
pit in Blackburough somehow was fun, but I can almost guarantee at the time 
it happened they were pissed off.
