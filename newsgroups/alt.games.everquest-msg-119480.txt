Exactly - and as such, your post was utterly meaningless to the debate
in which DT referenced it.

You were even more careful to make sure it was clear what guild he was
in, after you spent some time vilifying the guild.

What's to refute? The comments you made in your first post may well be
100% accurate. It doesn't matter, since they don't in any way relate
to the topic of "did a GM kill Tunare to spite a player".

Except, of course, to small-minded people who are only interested in
cheering at the misfortune of others.

>>>Does that make my opinions less valid?
>>Under the circumstances, yes. 
>You mean the circumstances of you disagreeing with me?

What makes you think I disagree with you? As far as I recall, I
haven't made any statement regarding the actions of Stasis.

I've already explained the circumstances under which you are less
credible than Martin. Sorry if you missed it.

When an unrelated post is used to support someone's argument (as DT
did by using your very first post ever to attempt to undermine
Martin's position), I'll consider it.
