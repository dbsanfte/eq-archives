Well, the one that occurs to me would be any of the various bard 
quests.  With these, you go to a mob at a fixed location, say a stock 
phrase, get an item, then go to another location, find another mob at 
another fixed location, and give him the item.  Then you return to the 
first guy and repeat.

Since none of those steps changes at all, if you can figure out how to 
set up to have your program run the whole thing, it could loop at that 
part and do it again and again and again.

Sadly, eventually the exp you'd get would be so tiny that it might take 
hundreds of repeats to level.  I guess if you left it run overnight or 
over a long weekend you might squeeze another level or two out of it 
when any human agent would long since have given up.

This would also generate gold in large quantities, in fact, I'd be 
concerned that eventually this would actually overload you to the extent 
that your macro -would- stop working, since you'd slow down and then you 
wouldn't be repeating the exact same course after all, pressing forward 
for 10 seconds would no longer get you as far as it did before.

Figure out how to move to the same spots even while encumbered, and 
leave it running long enough and you'd instead end up dead, because 
zoning with very large amounts of encumberance causes "falling" damage 
sufficient to kill you.
