/agree - I also find it ironic that to play a bard well it is essential to
have at least a basic idea of what other classes can do, yet all too few
other players know the strengths and weaknesses of bards.

I never led groups until my late twenties - now I usually end up the leader.
A classic example is what happened in OT the other night. I joined 3 other
players, WAR, SHD, MAG. We were joined by another WAR and a CLR. After the
MAG left I took over the group, and 4 hours later we were still chain
pulling, only the group consisted of MNK, SHM, SHM, DRU, ENC and BRD. I
changed songs and stratagies several times, starting off in a Tank heavy
group Buffing AC/HASTE and slowing the Mobs down. I ended up meleeing whilst
twisting STR/MANA and STAMINA REGEN songs. Now I don't know if that was what
I 'should' be doing, but it works for me.

Just get ready to be more popular when you hit 20 and 32, there is no
getting away from it - and trust me Enchanters dread getting to Breeze and
Clarity levels almost as much as Bards do :)

Above all ENJOY playing a bard!!
