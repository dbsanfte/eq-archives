There is skill in doing fights so that your mana use is minimized - a
skill handy for groups as well. This isn't a factor when it comes back
nearly instantaneously anyways.

The fact people aren't even realizing this is another indication
player abilities are atrophying. I was noticing a growing number of
clueless newbies in the 50s for a long time, and I think KEI is a part
of it. Frankly, a lot of these KeI junkies would never have made it to
50 prekunark.
