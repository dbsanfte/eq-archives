My ogre shaman happily did several levels killing guards in freeport.  I can't
think of any reason at all that would be frowned on, though, they weren't out in
the newbie zone, they either roam or static spawn inside the city where they
aren't protecting any players from newbie mobs of any description, further they
drop helms needed for the NFP paladin quest; its pretty clear to me that these
are meant to be hunted mobs by some.

In fact, continuing this line of thought, I really can think of very few
instances of guards that shouldn't be killable by one person or another; the only
ones that deserve some special consideration are the guards in newbie areas which
will peel off and kill mobs that are pursuing newbies.

I happily killed dark elf guards (and those stone things) in Nektulous with good
oriented characters, leaving alone only the ones near Neriak which might have
been used as a defense by hapless newbie DE.  I then happily killed halflings in
that same zone with the help of those same guards as an ogre shaman... and went
and killed halfling guards in Misty Thicket with the same character.  And my
Dwarf Cleric killed bouncers inside Ogguk, because ogres are the enemy and again,
its not as though those guards were serving any defensive duty for players; there
are no ogre killing mobs wandering around in there that those bouncers will aggro
on.

While I've heard this "the exp nerf was to stop guard killers" idea expressed
before, I really don't see it; either thats not the real reason for the nerf, or
else that reason doesn't make sense to me.

If its a ZEM nerf as some have said, then its not evenly applied anyway; zones
like Kelethin, West Freeport, and Paineel, which have extensive newbie fighting
in them would be different from zones like Ogguk or Neriak which don't have
fighting in them normally except for occaisional guard killing and now the rodent
quests.  I certainly didn't notice any nerfing in GFay when leveling up my little
gnomagician recently, killing the bats and skellies and orc pawns seemed to give
just as much exp as ever.

If this is the case, then running the mail from felwithe to kelethin should give
different exp than running, hmm, can't think offhand of a mail quest that ends
inside a town thats not also a newbie zone.  Oh wait, Erudin to South Qeynos;
there's no exp mob hunting normally in SQ.

If its not a zone based nerf, but rather a systematic nerfing of quest exp, then
the exp for the two quests should still be identical, should be easy enough to
test with fresh made newbie characters and ten minutes running around with POK
for transportation.
