My first character, a dwarven paladin, did the LoIO thing, and yes, he 
leveled quite fast there. I wanted to do something different for my new 
character, who is a druid. North Karana beetles are easy to kill, good 
xp, and if you are hunting away from the griffs, pose no danger 
whatsoever. You can always outrun them with sow. I was charming a 
Highland Lion, sending it after a Borer beetle, dot and nuke the borer 
twice, and med, the Lion finishes it off with very little health left, 2 
xp for the price of one. Charm breaks too early, take both to the guards 
near the gypsies if you have too. The scythe beetles are rather easy to 
kill as well. I went from 14 to 18 in 2 days hunting in the Karanas. The 
port in NK means the ocassional Enchanter will be passing by, trade sow 
for Clarity and you are Set (yes, with a capital S). 

Fear kiting Gators in Oasis is another option you might consider, but on 
Terris Thule, every gator spawn is usually aggro'd within about 10 
seconds. Very popular hunting, it seems.
