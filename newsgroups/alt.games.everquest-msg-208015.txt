Ignore them.  I always figure if I yell TRAIN and people are camping at a zo
they better just look up from what they are doing to see if something is
coming their way.  Even if you do everything in your power to help prevent
train deaths people will still complain.  There are just too many idiots.
The other day I was trying out my new extended affliction item on the undead
in the grey.  I noticed that a couple people were camping *inside* the zone
out to mons letalis.  So I adjusted my train hotkey to make it clear where I
was going.  These guys suggested instead of training I should just die
instead.  So next time I moved to the scarlet desert zoneout area so I
wouldnt bother them and adjusted my hotkey accordingly.  These guys still
complained.  So I announced to the zone these guys are morons for camping
inside the zoneout and then compaining of trains and put the guy on /ignore.
How can people get to this high level of game and still be so ignorant?
