That guide is full of errors. DEX plays no part in recovering interrupted
spellcasting - that is purely done with a skill check vs Channelling.
The confusion arises because DEX _is_ a factor in how fast you _learn_ the
Channelling Skill. But once you have maxed Channel for your level, DEX makes
no difference.
