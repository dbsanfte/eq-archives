Never sat right with you ... that's fine and dandy.  Frankly, it never sat
too well with me, either.  But that's your belief system.  If others choose
to believe that the bible is the "inerrant, infallible word of God", well,
as far as I'm concerned that's okay, too.

It's not my place to tell the literal believer of the bible that they're
wrong.  They're right, through their eyes ... your earlier example of
believing in an irridescent green sky makes my point better than I could.
