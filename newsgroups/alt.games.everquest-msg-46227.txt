AHA!  So THAT is how it got to be where I live!  It's a CONSPIRACY!!!!  
I ought to know about WNV, given that it's hit my state twice already.

Okay, it's also not entirely true that there have been no cases of pink 
pixies.

It is not some sort of semidivine being.  It is merely "smallpox".  No 
capitalization needed.

Where do they get it from?  Where and how do they grow it?  I've grown 
cowpox virus, myself.  It takes some specialized facilities.

Let me explain what "of dubious effectiveness" means:  It means that 
it's a "vaccine" only in theory.  And we haven't the faintest idea what 
negative side effects (including death) could be.  You going to 
volunteer your children for the experimentation?

You have to be wearing the mask BEFORE inhalation to prevent problems.  
Closing the barn door after the horse gets out won't help.

*I* am slacking?  What the hell do you know about me and the work I do?  
What the hell do YOU know about the difficulty of the task.  Since you 
know ALL answers, you tell ME how to make the breakthroughs and tell me 
RIGHT NOW!  How many long hours have YOU put in in the lab?  How many 
nights have YOU spent in the lab?  How many years have YOU gone when 
your only "vacation" was the week you took to get surgery?  Do you have 
the faintest IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS TASK.  EVEN THE 
*****THEORY***** OF MASS PRODUCTION OF ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE AS WE PLAN 
TO DO IT DIDN'T EXIST FIVE YEARS AGO.

What work have YOU done in this field?  Come on, what lab are you in?  
Where do you work?  What materials have YOU produced?  Come on, how will 
YOU break through on this and set us leaping decades ahead?

Come on, I'm waiting for your answers!!!!!!

Thank me?  But I'm just a piece of worthless shit that has been doing 
nothing but slacking off!!!!  Shouldn't I just be shot?

A vaccine can be produced for ONE of the diseases--and how many of the 
poeple who read this newsgroup do you think is the CEO of Eli Lilly?  
The anthrax "vaccine" is almost just a "vaccine" in theory only.

Because it sounds monumentally stupid to warn about "nuclear" events 
occuring at "nuclear" power plants.  It sounds like warning about "water 
falling" at a hydroelectric plant.

And it may not even work in the first place.

You are the defeatist.  You are the one advocating fear and terror.

I know exactly what the situation is, and your methods are as effective 
as "duck and cover".


> I spread methods to give a peace of mind, your words have simply painted

You spread methods that give *false* peace of mind and you spread them 
using the most panic-laden language imaginable.  Gas masks don't work if 
you don't have them on.  You going to live your entire life wearing a 
gas mask?
