I got sucked into this. Have an untwinked character started April '99, few
months after release anyway, with ~30 days played and only level 24. Took a
day off of screwing around and solo'd them to 26 in what I would guess about
8 hours of a saturday. Hard to tell the exact amount of time I was doing it
since I got distracted a few times while selling junk.

Two 'mid levels' of camping and PL'ing my chr is about all I could stand.
Now back to my regularly scheduled program of attempting every broken and
worthless quest in the game.
