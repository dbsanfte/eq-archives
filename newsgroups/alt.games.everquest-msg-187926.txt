I almost said something, then read this.  What Martin
said.  Well, one more thing.  I'm a 61 mage, and I almost
never mem FoT - the only nuke that really approaches
high end wiz nukes.  Why?  Well, like most mages that level
I'm Conj specced and FoT is Evoc.  Also, it's LoS.  Try
and get unobstructed LoS for 7 seconds sometime in cramped
quarters.  Nothing like losing 500 mana into some one's
back because they moved a second before the nuke went off.
