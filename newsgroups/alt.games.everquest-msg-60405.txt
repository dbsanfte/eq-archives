Yep, and the single player or party kill ones are the easiest to get
out of the way first (which the overking is not of course.. ;) )

Similar to this the druid one you can get all the foraging out of the
way first but you really don't need to, kill the aqua gob, kill the
baracuda, kill the gorilla, kill the mammoth, kill the corrupted hill
giant, doing all of those solo. Next get the kedge one, ulump (more
tank centric), corrupt cyclops, in small groups. Kill venril sathir
remains in a few more groups when its up, get a jade reaver in a
similar groups composition. You can do all of those kills before even
beginning the quest actually and in any order. It just makes it easier
in the druids if you do it order since you can turn in 3 or 4 pieces
at a time for one piece you later need.. well actually you don't even
have to have done the earlier parts to have the npc combine the 3 or 4
drops. Mainly its just easier to get people to help you with the later
parts from your guild if you are up to that step.

I currently just have ulump, kedge and then the spawned fayd left in
the druid one. The first two are of course easy its just getting the
people to want to go in this lean time post DAOC and during the
holidays when usually if we have the people on we go and do tov or
such. It does smart a bit as a druid like this when you have such
trivial things such as Ulump which take less than a half and hour yet
if a cleric is doing a part of their epic such as ragefire or an
enchanter is waiting for shishar to pop in fear those take precedence
though you are so close to blowing leaves.
