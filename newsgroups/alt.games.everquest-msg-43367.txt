I'm starting to lose my patience, I have been getting the 1017 error message
for 5 days now and cannot get any help from Verant. Their Tech support
channel just tell me to try later. I have e-mailed them also but they have
never returned any of my e-mails before so I'm not expecting a reply. Does
anyone know if there is something I can change from my end that will help. I
have tried repatching, I have direct x 8 and the latest drivers for my video
card. I have changed nothing on my system at all for a long time. I have
even tried un-installing and re-installing EQ, and have also installed EQ on
my wifes computer but still get the same error message.

How a company that has such a great game like EQ and such shitty customer
service is beyond me.

Any help will be much appreciated

Regards
Dave
