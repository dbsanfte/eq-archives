Please, the only time consuming part was getting to the npc with 2
dozen people gathered around spamming the world.

The EC tunnel is a zone away from a PoK book.  From start to finish
it took 15 minutes for my mage to go from PoK to Qeynos-south to 
Freeport to EC and complete this.  Since I'm bound in WW and couldn't
use gate, this is about how long it would take a melee starting from
PoK.
