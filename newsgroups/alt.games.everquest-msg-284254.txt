There's at least one full write up on how to trigger the pegasus on the 
web, but what it boils down to is being able to spot a mob on a really 
short respawn (like 30 seconds or something, it's been a while) and 
killing it until it triggers some kind of cycle.

The method which most people employ these days works just as well, bring 
20 friends, kill every-single-mob in SK.
