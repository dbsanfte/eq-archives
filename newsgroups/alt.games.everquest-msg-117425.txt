Or anything besides warrior/cleric?  I am thinking of playing (a lot)
more on FV, regular server play is getting pretty boring lately.  I'm
not too fond of the 15 druid I have on FV now, I'd "reroll" him in a
heartbeat if I knew of a guild worth trying to join, even if it means
I have to go beyond role-"play" and adopt role-"speech".
