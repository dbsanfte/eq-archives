I didn't see it, this was bits and pieces of conversation overheard on the
bridge.

Still could - NK is usually practically empty. The downside to running two
chars is my chanter is always looking for his next sow and my druid is
always looking for crack ;-)

*sigh* The reason I put my enchanter into storage for a bit was to finish
getting up to 20 on my druid so I could get me one of those. Camping the
GBS as a non-tracker is inefficient. I got her to spawn only once while
working it as an enchanter and was promptly KSed by a necro that got to
her before I did. (He said later he had spotted her pet on track,
sense-the-dead, and had just been curious to see what it might be)
