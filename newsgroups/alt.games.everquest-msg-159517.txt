    Spiders are sub-50, or at least the ordinary ones are. Frogs vary by
"name" as to what level they are - see the Bestiary at Allakhazam's to get
some idea how they vary. I've seen mobs at the front of Sebilis be light
blue or even green at 60.

    Actually, he says that 50 is light blue at 62. There's no contradiction.

    If anyone wants to experiment, that's the way to do it. I don't use the
new UI, or I could have done a /who level in the Bazaar to find Traders that
were the correct level (/who 54 still finds all level 54 traders), and used
the /bazaar function to actually track them down to /con them. Dan Day, if
you want to do this some time with some of your guildmates I can be your
level 64 person. And in the near future (sometime this weekend or sooner), I
can also be your level 65 person. ;-)
