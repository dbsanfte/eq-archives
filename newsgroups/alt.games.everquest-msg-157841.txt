    XP'ing is a separate issue, for me at least. But on raiding old content,
this is my perspective: every day you spend killing stuff from SoL is one
less day you'll have to farm the end-game content in PoP. This makes the
assumption that the drops you get from farming old content will not
significantly hasten your exploration of the new content, and I think that
assumption is a fairly valid one for some of the mobs on your list.

    This depends on what your definition of "solid XP" is and how much your
players play. If the members of the guild are eventually going to get every
AA they want anyways because they play enough, then you're likely right - it
won't make a difference. But if every caster in the guild at 260 INT/WIS got
two AA points through solid XP (Juggs, AoE etc.) and put those towards the
"expanded INT/WIS" AA, would that not add more total mana to the guild than
those ten drops? If all the tanks that could got Planar Durability with
their AA's, would that not add more HPs total than the drops you got? If
your melees get to 64 one day sooner, won't the increase in primary hand
minimum damage outdamage all the weapons you got in those encounters?

    We're having the exact same debate in our guild. What I've proposed is
we do Emperor until our competitors have sufficient rifts to enter and
compete in Vex Thal (we're in a rotation with people that, until recently,
hadn't killed him - don't ask), and do Vex Thal until two other guilds enter
(right now we're the only raid force there). Anything else isn't worth the
time compared to what we could be pulling out of the Plane of Time months
from now with time saved from skipping the old stuff. Oh, Seru isn't on my
list because we haven't killed him yet. Yeah, we're slow. =/
