Depends on what zone you are in. Mostly, the expansion gets you new images
for items, weapons, armour and characters. Biggest complaint I have heard is
how big the foreheads on erudites are now. Going to take a lot more
sunscreen to cover that melon. ;->
And the lag on Luclin maybe a problem for you. Many people report that the
lag on Luclin makes Luclin itself unplayable. Luclin makes ALOT more demands
on your video subsystem than pre-Luclin. I had to upgrade from an ATI Rage
Fury 128 to a Nvidia GeForce 200MX.
You can still play your old character. It's an expansion.

Horses at this point are still very expensive. I *think* they start about
10K and go up to 100K. Don't buy one of the entry level horses if you are
looking to improve your travel speed any. Apparently, the entry level ones
aren't much faster then some classes own native running speeds or are very
comparable to Tboots or Jboots, depending on how much you spend. But you
said you are a druid, so I don't suppose you will have much problems
traveling anyway. Mostly they are still status symbols.

Hope that helped.
