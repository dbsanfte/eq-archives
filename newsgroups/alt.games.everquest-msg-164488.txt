Im currently at a point in the game where I am torn between wanting to
level up my charater (ala XP Grinding) and being bored of doing so.  I
LOVE to travel, adventure and see new things, its why I started/kept
playing Everquest.  The problem is that not many other people seem to want
to do so, for most its XP, Loot, XP, Loot, ad nauseam.

So I still do my thing, I wander around seeing new things (Just got my
first glimpse of Lavastorm and Najena the other day, quite cool looking :)
And I do have alternates I play to help counter the bordem of grinding.
So my question is this: how did/do you guys get past this point in your
EQ life?  Did any of you get to this point?


Now I also had an idea:
Perhaps giving more XP for quests.  Which is not that big of a deal
considering the items now that you usually get from quests, well, are
mostly sub-par and not worth getting.  Granted most quests require that
you kill Mob A, loot it; kill Mob B, loot it; hand in item to complete
quest, so there is SOME XP gained from doing the quests.  But not nearly a
quarter of the amount you could get while grinding, so whats the point?

I think that if quests gave more XP, it would give people more desire to
perhaps do the quests, see the world a bit, and get some XP in the process
(sounds like a Navy advertisement).  Or perhaps start some new quests with
no item gain, but a decent chunk of XP, maybe a few plat and some faction.
Maybe it can be worked out that a timer starts and for every 5-10 minutes
an amount of XP equal to killing a blue mob is put into a pool.  You
finish the quest say in 2 hours, you get the XP in the pool.  Of course
there would be a limit as to how much XP you can get, where more time
makes no more difference (to stop exploits).
