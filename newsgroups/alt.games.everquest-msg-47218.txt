* disclaimer: I haven't learn the fine art of chain-casting pets yet*

Well, being only a lvl38.5 soloing mage, I don't know about FG's but...

I have been soloing almost exclusively with the fire pet since lvl29 and
have had great success.  I only have trouble keeping him alive against very
high blues that hit hard (70's) and fast (too bad we don't get a slow
spell).  The main reason I use fire is that awesome dmg shield. And the fact
that I don't have to waste mana casting it.  I most heartlily recommend the
fire pet for these levels.

Supposedly the air pet gets hit a lot less because of it's agility...I have
not found this to be true with the ones I have tested.  It seems to need
more healing than the fire pet and dies a lot more often.  I haven't noticed
it *not* getting hit as much as the other pets. *shrug*  That is only my
observation...don't take it as fact.

The only reason I would ever use the earth pet is on fleeing mobs that might
cause a train.  It has a lot of hp's but takes a LOT of abuse.  I have no
problem keeping the mob's aggro on my pet so that would not be a reason for
me to use the earth pet.

The water pet would be my second favorite soloing pet.  All-around good
stats, hits hard, nice spell dmg, etc.  The only thing that puts it in
second is the fire pet's dmg shield.

Once again, I know my fellow mages out there have their *favorite* pet for
varying reasons and these are only my observations.

On a side note, I have noticed the lvl34 water and air pet hit for max 34
while the lvl 34 fire pet hits for max 32.  Anyone know the max hit for
lvl34 earth pet?
