Two books a day...now there's someone I can respect. ;)  I'd read about
one a day if I didn't have to work, even as it is, I manage to read during
the 20 minute walk to and from work.

Incidentally, if you are fortunate enough to have a good library, or
library network, reading *is* a cheap hobby. The selection of decent books
where I am is really quite amazing...they might not always have the exact
book I want, but they'll always have *something* worth getting into.

I know not everyone is blessed with good libraries though.
