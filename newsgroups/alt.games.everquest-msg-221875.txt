The Gnome quests are now a piece of cake as the drop rates have been
increased tremendously. We must have done the quests back when the
kobold items were rare indeed, as I remember my Wizard's quest being
very frustrating. Now they are common drops and kobolds no longer agro.

The GFay quests are as difficult as any can get. In 3 weeks playing our
"fun" newbie chars on Stromm, myself and 3 friends have seen ONE Giant
Sylvan Bat Fur drop. Add the fact that most items are nodrop. In
Feerrott, Yellow lizard scales are infuriating to get. Our guild killed
the zone for 3 hours for a beastlord and 3 dropped. Beastlords need 8 I
believe. Barbarian quests involve visiting the vendors, buying the items
and off you go.

Balance? The word doesn't seem to exist in EQ developers' vocabulary!
Too easy is no fun, to difficult and mobs are green long before armor is
complete. I applaud newbie armor quests, but please Sony, have a look at
them as a whole. Why such a divergence in difficulty?
