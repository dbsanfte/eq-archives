Well, if you create a man who is weak, and surround him with temptation, 
it's quite self-evident that your intention is for him to sin. This is 
compounded by the fact that, as an omniscient being, you *know* he's going 
to sin.

Absurd? Not at all... Sit back, and think about what omniscience means and 
implies. God already knows what everybody who is yet to be born will do, all 
the way to the extintion of mankind, if it ever happens, and what's more, 
he's known since *forever* what every man, woman and child who has ever 
existed, or will ever exist, will do, trillions of years (hell, an infinity 
of years, in fact) before he actually created them.

That is what omniscient means. Think about it, and see where the absurdity 
lies.

How can he allow them to determine the course of their lives? He's known 
what every one of them would do at every juncture of their lives since 
before they even existed. What free will is that?

Of course he does. He knows fully well (has known for all eternity, in fact) 
who will succeed and who will fail.

No, that's not the argument. An omnipotent God can create imperfect beings. 
An omnipotent God is the ultimate 800-pound gorilla, he can do whatever he 
damn well pleases. Asking "why" is just trying to second-guess him, which 
neither of us is in a capacity to do.

What you cannot do is exonerate god from the responsibility he has over his 
creations. If he creates cancer, and he creates tobacco, and he creates a 
man who is weak of will, and he places him in an environment that does not 
allow him to grow stronger of will, and he has known all this since the very 
beginning of time, how can you say he has no responsibility?
