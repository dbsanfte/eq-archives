Guess they just caved and finally decided to pacify the "no one wants
me in their group, whaaaaa..." crowd. IMHO, anyone who can't find a
use for a druid in a group isn't someone I care to group with anyway.
It's not like you have a pool of any players you might want to choose
from when you start a group, "Uh, let's see, I'll take 2 warriors, 1
chanter, 1 shaman, 1 cleric and 1 wizard. Yeah, that ought ta do it.
Everyone else, go away."

How about this one, "I'm a chanter and no groups that already have a
chanter want me, whaaaaa..."

Again I'll say, druids, of which I am one, have plenty going for them
as it is. They don't need this. At least when they *can't* find a
group, for whatever reason, they have the option of soloing quite
effectively. Therefore, they *always* have the option of utilizing
their time in an xp-generating fashion. Ask a rogue what *they* think
of that.
