Agreed, 100%. But in this very group, you're still going to find a
hardcore section of players who are on the other side of the fence. I've
never understood it, but then again, I've never understood anti-abortion
terrorists either.

I used to be one of the ones that, when some idiot_01 was selling
something I wanted and auctioning with no price, would say "how much"?
If they responded with the "make me an offer" fucking bullshit, I'd
offer them five plat for an FBSS (for example). But I found that this
only leads to even *more* long, drawn out, unproductive conversation
with these morons. Now when I get that answer, I simply answer "No
thankyou." and move on. If they keep sending tells, I just use /ignore. 
It's a pity, because if it's a high end item, I might be the only *cash*
buyer in the zone, as opposed to all of the buy-low-sell-high traders
there, and they just missed a chance at a good sale because they were
trying to be greedy rip-off fucks.

Yet still, you'll get those here who will go on and on about the
"honorable tradition of haggling" and "let the buyer beware" bullshit,
etc. etc.  Pathetic, really.
