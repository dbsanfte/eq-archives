Guess I wasn't paying attention! But, you have to admit that necros 
seem to get top billing when it comes to soloing! :-)

Yeah, that'd be him. He killed me 3x in rapid succession as I tried to 
retrieve my corpse. Finally I was able to get help from a passerby to 
drag my corpse out of his usual path of travel. After that, I was always 
really on edge when I had to go to the bank with poor ol' Raniele!

Does anyone know if Iksar Necro's are KOS to anyone in Cabilis?
