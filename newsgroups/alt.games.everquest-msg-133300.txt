    He feels it's unfair for a few reasons. One, Furor is under the
impression that on Stormhammer mobs are repopped for players by GMs. This
means that those tradeable items are entering the game faster than they are
on regular servers, giving people on Stormhammer an advantage. He also seems
upset that people are being allowed to move at will between servers, despite
the promise that people could only go to Stormhammer and back to their
original server. This isn't speculation on his point - I've seen players do
exactly that, what amounts to a server transfer with all gear. Furor has
encouraged people to transfer to Veeshan to join FoH, and always has them do
it legitimately - so I can see how this would infuriate him.

    As for upsetting the toybox? Heh, he shouldn't have made so many pot
shots at Krurk after he left I guess. No matter what Krurk did (the rumor is
he sold guild funds and items on E-Bay).
