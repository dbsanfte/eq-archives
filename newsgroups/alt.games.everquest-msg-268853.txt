Please don't toppost here.

Do not get the 5200, you will regret it.  It is actually slower than most 
of the GF4s.  It does have better DX9 support than the 4s, but that is 
it's only advantage.

The ATi 9800 Pro is a decent card for EQ2, the 128MB version works fine, 
and it's far better than the 5200.
