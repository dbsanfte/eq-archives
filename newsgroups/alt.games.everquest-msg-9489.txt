Not a bad one, but they're not all that common, and there's always
competition for them.

LQ are a pain to sell. Be prepared to /auction for them for several days.
And HQ are so rare as to me nigh-mythical. I was killing bears non-stop for
a week, and I got one every other day.

> 3. Kill wolves and cats. LQ, MQ, HQ pelts sell for around 1-2+ pp.

Fat chance of getting that much for them.
