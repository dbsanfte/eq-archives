So did my newsgroup server. I am pretty sure the original had no subject at
all so got canned, but the repply ended up with the subject of <re:(no
subject)> which was a subject of sorts so got through.

In answer to Jazz, I think it is continuation of an existing stalker rather
than a new one. New ones normally attempt to "diss" directly first, but once
the collective NG diplomatically points out that they happen to be utter
fuckwits, they beat their little hands against the ground in a crying fit,
then decide to stalk.

I think Biz has a few stalkers in lurking mode, because whenever any new
aspiring one attempts the ill fated "direct diss" route, you always see a
few of the same old names pop in for a guest appearance to lend moral
support  to the latest addition to their fold.
