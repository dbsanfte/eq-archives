About to ding 55 real soon and looking to upgrade my equipment.  I'm a paid
subscriber to allakhazam.com and use their nice equipment search engine.
However, when reading all the stuff that's better than mine, it looks like
almost all require me to join a raid to get it.  What I'm wondering is if
there's gear that I can still get by soloing or where pick-up groups are
common.  Now that my wisdom is at 200, I'd like to raise my resists to 100
each.  However, people have said that resists are situational and that I
should work on two sets of gear.  One for resists (and still gives me at
least 200 WIS) for raids where it is needed, such as Temple of Veeshan.  One
for regular use (again, gives me at least 200 WIS) and focus on raising my
mana, AC, and HP ... in that order.  Oh, and a third set of CHA gear for
buying dots and selling loot ... though WIS level isn't important in this
case.  Additionally, I have about 4,000 plat in the bank and I'm a Halfling
so weight is an issue.

Suggestions?
