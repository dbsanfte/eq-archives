OK< I know we discussed this already, but

/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion
of combat. We want to add an option that would work much like an
instant messenger. Each time you get a "tell" from a new
character, a new chat window would open. That window will only
display "tells" from the particular character, and any message
sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a "tell"
to that character. Obviously this would be an optional feature. 

I set up a seperate window where all group and tell chat goes. 
This means I have conversational record recorded serially as it
comes in, easy to scroll up and see what I missed.

Popping up a new tell window for each person seems crazy, why on
earth would anyone want that?  A window for all tells, sure, but
as I note, thats easily done with the current system.

And popup style?  Is there anything anyone hates more about
modern web surfing than popups?

In fact, is there any way I can turn off the multiple item popup
thing?  I used to be able to go thru a vendor's wares, clicking
on each one I was interested in looking at, and it would turn off
the old popup and turn the new one on.  But now, I get multiple
iterations clogging up my screen, bunch of old stuff I already
saw.  And I used to be able to click on the item again to close
the window, now doing that opens another copy of the window I
already have (can't think of any concievable use for that one, at
least multiple items in their own windows are good for
comparisons.)
