You could try out Echo Caverns.
Underbulks, stonegrabbers and fungal fiends give xp up to 51.
There seems to be an xp bonus here too, but I'm not sure how much.
The loot is ok, up to 6 plat off the stonegrabbers, and the underbulks drop
claws (stackable) that sell for a few plat each to vendors.
There is a room at the back full of mobs that has a zone to "The Deep" just
off it. I have never had to use that route to escape, so I'm not sure how
safe it is on the other side (maybe someone else could input here)
