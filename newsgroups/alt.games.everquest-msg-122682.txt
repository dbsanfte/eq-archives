I don't remember seeing any heat comparisons.

As a rule the newer cards tend to produce less heat. The GPU (Graphics
Processing Unit) is made from a smaller silicon die. So it requires
less power to run the chip which means less heat produced as a
by-product. The newer chips are clocked to higher rates, which does
make them run hotter over-all, but not enough to offset the heat
savings gained by going with a smaller die.

As a semi-educated guess I would say that the newer cards do not run
any hotter than what you are using now.
