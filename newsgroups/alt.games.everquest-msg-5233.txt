OK, I had problems with routing to the EQ servers recently - doing
tracerts to Morell-Thule showed I was getting big packet loss halfway
between me and Verant. This doesn't necessarily mean there's nothing you
can do about it - you may have problems with your TCP setup that are
only manifesting themselves now because a router at some ISP a few hops
away from you has started acting up, whereas your less-than-optimal
setup is fine when everything on the internet is running smoothly.

I used the online tweak tester at http://www.dslreports.com/tweaks to
check my system over and discovered I had my RWIN (TCP receive window)
set way too high - this is a registry setting and is often set wrong for
your system - by default it's set appropriately for an analogue modem,
and when people get a cable modem or DSL they (or some software
installer) often just bump it up to the max setting, but really you want
to set it *just* high enough for you. Too low and you limit the amount
of data being sent to you when you have a nice broadband connection
capable of much more, but *crucially* set it too high and you get more
data chucked at you than you can handle and end up dropping packets.
After adjusting my settings using the recommendations at dslreports.com,
I stopped having packet loss problems, even though the tracerts showed
the problem router to be somewhere in the middle of the chain, not at
Verant or my ISP.

I'm not saying that your RWIN setting is the problem, just giving an
example of the sort of thing this could be, and the sort of thing that
would get picked up by the online tweaktester.
