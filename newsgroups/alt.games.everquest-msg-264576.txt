There aren't as many, but they are around. For example, enter Forest Ruins 
and run around to the left side of the castle. Just as you cross the river 
there is an entrance on the right to an underground passage of waterways 
beneath the castle. There are some lurkers there with double down arrows. I 
remember these because I fought them when they were blue to me and with the 
double down arrows they still yielded good experience but were a cakewalk to 
take out. It was a fun find.

I didn't get that familiar with runes in EQ, did they work the same way in 
all respects as Wards? For example, did they have a timer on them and they 
would expire whenever they took enough hitpoint damage, or the timer ran 
out, whichever came first? And if they ran out of time and still had 
remaining HP, did that HP transfer to the player Runed? It's a neat system 
and I remember druids using them on the tanks in EQ but I guess I didn't 
fully understand it.
