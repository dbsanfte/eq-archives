    snare: a spell that slows a monster's running speed
    dot: Damage Over Time spell
    Nuke: direct (instant) damage spell
    Kite: The word kiting describes the practise of running away from a mob
while it chases you. Because you appear to be towing it after you as though
attached on a lead, people decided to call it Kiting. Fear kiting is the
same thing only the monster runs away from you and you chase it... usually a
lot closer.
    Mob = mobile npc (an old mud term I think, not sure though never really
got into muds)

Hope that helps,
James
