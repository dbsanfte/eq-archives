Just a question for all you out there. What do you consider to be a fair
price for the Wu's armor? While cost wise its relatively cheap, about 15 to
20pp per piece, it requires a high tailoring skill (which is not real easy
to raise) a enchanter willing to make Vials of Mana, a master brewer willing
to take the time to make a lot of headies and someone to hunt for all the
silk needed, so time is a real factor. I've seen it as cheap as 50pp per
piece and as expensive as 200pp, but then very few people seem to be making
it, or at least I haven't seen to many.
