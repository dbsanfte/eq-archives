Mitch,

  Regretfully, EQ cannot be downloaded (legally, since the -only- legal
means would be from Sony themselves and they do -not- have it for download).

   Your only legal option is to contact EverQuest/Sony and tell them of your
situation.

   Now, on to the curiousity part.  What happened to your installed version
of EverQuest?  By saying you broke your CD without stating that you either
A. Got your computer stolen, B. Formatted your hard drive, C.  Got a virus
that wiped out your hard drive.. we are left to believe that you migh have
thought EQ was played from the CD itself and wish to download it illegally.
However, I dont think thats the case, is it?
