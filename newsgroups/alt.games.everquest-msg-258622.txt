The simple answer to your question is that Item and Buff haste stack; 
you add them together to reach your total haste, noting that if this is 
over your haste cap any remainder will be lost.

Thus, case 1: 71% haste
Case 2: 109% haste, cut down to your cap, in this instance 100%.

BUT the haste situation is more complex than that.

First off, your haste cap is apparantly based on your level; I don't 
have figures for this, but your cap at level 1 might be as low as 25%, 
and its possible that its actually higher than 100% over 60, which was 
the old level cap, at any rate it was said back then that the full 100% 
cap wasn't reached until somewhere in the 50s.  More educated heads than 
mine can probably point you towards more detail on this.  The effect is 
most noticable on very low level highly twinked people, and might be 
harder to see now that very low level people can't be hit with very high 
% haste buffs.

Second, there are more than two kinds of haste, the ones you mentioned,

Worn item haste
and Buff haste (whether from a caster or from a proc/clicky off an item)

but also

Song Haste 1) This counts as Buff Haste, won't stack with it
Song Haste 2) this is also known as Overhaste, not only does it stack 
with the other two kinds of haste but also ignores the haste cap; the 
amounts of haste from this song line are pretty tiny for their level, 
they generally shouldn't be used unless you already have Buff Haste or 
Song Haste 1) (which is really the same thing)

If, however, your haste cap is 100%, and you have the item and buff you 
mention in case 2 above, then someone singing the 5% overhaste song for 
you will still put you only at 105% haste, not at 114% haste as you 
might think from the "breaks the haste cap" description many people 
bandy about.

Then there are some "burst of speed" effects such as Berserker's War Cry 
line which are supposed to stack with all of the above, and I think to 
go over the haste cap, so this is sort of like song haste 2), except 
that it should stack with song haste 2) while other song hastes won't.

You'll note, observing your buff box, that much of this is not at all 
obvious, because several different hastes and song hastes will all give 
you their icons, although others will overwrite each other.

This is not, however, an indicator that the Haste on those buffs is 
stacking, rather, its that the buffs are doing something in addition to 
haste, and they can coexist to provide those other effects; you'll only 
get the haste effect from the best haste you have in each category.

There are, to confuse things further, some items which provide song 
haste 2) type effects...
