Its been a while since I did this quest, but I think the answer might be 
that you don't actually need to kill a "Krag Warrior", but rather that 
the item you want drops randomly off any sort of Krag mob rarely.

Then again, its possible that this is one of the items I bought off the 
vendors in the windmills, without knowing that it dropped off an ultra 
rare mob.
