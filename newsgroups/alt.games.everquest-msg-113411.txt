I just checked it out.

Invis, Invis to/vs Undead, and Hide all prevent you from
initiating a trade with an NPC.  If you try to "hand" the
item on your cursor to the NPC, it simply does nothing
(i.e., does not open a trade window, nor give any message)
until you break your invis/hide.

But I'm not sure why this was a change worth doing.
All along, the act of initiating a trade with an NPC caused
your invis to drop automatically.

So I don't see a real difference between:

1.  Old: Walk up to NPC invisible, start a trade transaction,
    invis drops automatically.

2.  New:  Walk up to NPC invisible, click off your invis
    manually, start a trade transaction.

Either way, if the NPC is KoS to you, you'll get pasted if
it's high enough to aggro, or nothing will happen if it's
green enough not to aggro.

Other aspects of item turn-in, including pre-existing
behavior in response to actions you take after
initiating the turn-in, remain unchanged.

The only reason I can think they changed this is to head
off what must have been countless /petitions by people
who complained that they were indifferent to an NPC but
their quest turn-in failed, leaving the GM to explain that
if they started invis (and thus indifferent), the turn-in
didn't end that way since the invis drops automatically
(which is generally unnoticed).  And/or players who got
creamed by a KoS PC while turning in items invis, and
then /petitioned about getting attacked (not realizing
the invis would drop).

Now, at least, players have to purposely click off their
invis, invis dropping won't take them by surprise, and
will see their *real* faction before the turn-in.
Or if they don't check, it's their own fault.
