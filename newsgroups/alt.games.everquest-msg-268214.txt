While I'm out and about, I try to do some gathering along the way. It keeps 
the skill up (not that I have much reason to do so at this point, but you 
never know), and I thought I might make some of the basic food and drink 
items for myself at some point.

When I stepped up to the stove to see what I might be able to throw 
together, I was not able to find a single use for any of the 15 or so types 
of ingredients I had gathered. I'm talking things like carrots, spices, 
jumjum, cabbage, tea leaves, etc. These are certainly food ingredients, but 
I went through many of the available recipes available to me as a level 8 
artisan with all my basic artisan books and couldn't find any of these 
ingredients listed as part of a recipe. I ended up just deleting the 
majority of it to free up some room, as little can be sold to a vendor.

What gives? What does everyone else do with all the stuff they gather? Does 
is sell for much on the open market?
