I often wonderred why the colour of the cons was not configurable. 
Would make it a lot easier for color blind people and for people who
(like me) have (well had at least) a monitor that used to display the
dark blue so dark it was almost unreadable.

As for the others bemoaning the appearance of the rings just go to the
options panel and turn it off ... how hard is that?????

Cheers.
