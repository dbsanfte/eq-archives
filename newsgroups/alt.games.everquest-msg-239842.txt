From the shadows, the mysterious Ogmuk
<Ogmuk.139x0y@erollisimarr-dot-com-forum.com> (if that IS his real
name) conspiratorially whispered:

Welcome to usenet. You probably noticed usenet tends to be inhabited
by a rather hardnosed cynical bunch.

Personally I don't give a crap how someone accesses usenet. Gateway,
OE, proper newsreader... knock yourself out! Use whatever makes you
the most comfortable. Just make sure to follow usenet's established
etiquette and avoid its taboos and no one will even notice, other than
the sig.
