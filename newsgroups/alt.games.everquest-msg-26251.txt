Made me think: Would people rat out someone they knew bought and account?

Considering the diverse player base, everything from anal retentive to
blackmailing scumbags...

I mean there would be people that rat you out just because you broke the
rules.

There would be people who blackmail you "Rez my level 6 or I turn you in to
Verant." or "PL me or I rat you out."

I have no intentions of buying someone else's account or characters. If I
did I would look for a social leper with no friends yet, then try to change
the situation. I mean nothing quite like a level 60 cleric giving rezes to
make friends and influence people! Yeap, give me the obsessive compulsive
loaner with a level 60 cleric that was solo'd all the way and 14,000 pp in
the bank and I may be in the market.<grin>
