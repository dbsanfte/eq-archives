Where you can be bound. Any city zone, The Arena zone, the Gypsy camp in
North Karanas. There are some others but you shouldnt be needing them, and
those locs above should do you nicely for most hunting in newbie zones.

As to being ported, essenitally ask where you want to go and ask the
porters...or indeed any players on the ooc channle and you'll be told
where the nearest druid ring or wizard spire is. Essentially each
continent has a druid and a wizzy port somewhere reasonably central, and
there are I think 3 for the main continent of antonica, one pair in the
east of the continent, one pair in the west and one I think in the south
though Im not 100% percent sure.

Druid rings I know of Butcherblock, West commons, Surefall glade, Toxx
Forest (dunno about Kunark or Velious I walk)

Wizspires, Gfay, North Karanas, Toxx forest, I think there is one in the
commons or desert of Ro.

Essentially they are big enough and important enough features that they wi
be listed on EQatlas maps. look on www.eqatlas.com and find such features
as close to where you want to go as possible.
