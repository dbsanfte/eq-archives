Monks, Necros and Druids. Since the other two have been espoused, I will 
take up the druid soapbox.

Druids are the masters of travel- we get invis, sow, and ports. We have the 
ability to live off the land(forage) and healing spells to keep us alive. 
Add to this a swiss-army-knife assortment of spells, leather-class AC, and 
roots/snares/dots and you have a class that can solo for a loooong time 
without seeing a soul. And then, he can solo halfway across the world 10 
minutes later.
