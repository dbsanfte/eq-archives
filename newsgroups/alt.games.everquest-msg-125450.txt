You can get into the sewers in Qeynos without Gather Shadows but you need to
be very careful.  Get a map of the sewers and so you can get around.  It is
a hole in the water, located under the smaller dock (it will be the first
dock you see when the boat arrives-but not the one the boat stops at)  Swim
down into the hole and you will zone into the sewers.  I really recommend
this zone for newbie necros because the exp is great and it's pretty safe.
Very few MOBs are agressive. There is a bank and a guild down there so you
can get your next level spells when you need them.

There is supposed to be a place to buy food down there, but I have never
found it or seen it on a map.  I did find a place in the sewers that you can
get to from the rogues guild, but have never found how that area connects to
the rest of the sewer area.

You can then make your way through the sewers up to the secret entrance
outside the city.  It is best to get a bind there. You will need someone to
help you with that.  You can solo all the way to about level 15-16 in the
sewers in your little necro home away from home.  If you prefer groups you
are also very close to Blackburrow.

Also, if you kill bandits in West Karana it will raise your faction in
Qeynos.  They drop red sashes that can be turned in for faction.  My sons
Erudite Necro by 16th level was able to enter Qeynos safely.

Hope this helps.  Good Luck with your Necro-they are a lot of fun to play.
