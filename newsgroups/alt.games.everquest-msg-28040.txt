   I've often run into another varient of the "begging"
without being super obvious about it.  I'm talking about
people who want you to stop doing whatever it is you're 
doing, and show them where something is.  
   I was killing polar bear cubs by the 3 igloos in
Everfrost.  A Barbarian guy comes up to me.  "How do you
get to the plains?"  I tell him to go East.  "That's not
very helpful, now is it?"  I tell him sorry, this place
is a maze.  Ok....he knows its a maze.  He also knows 
that I'm high enough level to have a last name.  He knows
I can't just point him in a direction...I have to show him
to be useful.  So he wants me to be his personal guide, 
and show him how to get around in his own damned starting
zone.  Um, no.  Sorry, not even.
    I hate it when people come up to me when I'm in town,
obviously busy at a forge or brew-barrel, and ask me where
their guild, or the bank or gate or whatever, is.  I hate
it in Freeport, which is large...what?  You want me to run
you over two zones to get to whatever?  And I hate it in
Halas, which is small...what?  You're too goddamned lazy
to look your own annoying self?  I even get annoyed by
people who ask me how to do trade skills, though I will
usually give a starting recipie if they asked using full
words.  I took the time to do the research on the web, 
they can bloody well do the same.

Annie  <--- Was very annoyed this very morning, in fact,
            by some guy who first asked me for free cleric
            stuff, then asked me where the west gate in 
            Freeport was, then asked me how to brew, then
            tested all his /em with animations on me (I was
            good.  I didn't tell him to get his fucking 
            hands off of me when he /danced with me), and 
            the immediately locked me out of the barrel when
            went to the brewer and bought more bottles.
            I just wanted to finish that one stack of fish
            wine before I went to work!
