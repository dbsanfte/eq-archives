Its a nice idea but largely moot. There are so many hit and run scam
attempters in EQ that naming them is just like you having a board on a
street of Detroit that lists who is a crack head criminal. As you can
well imagine, soon that board becomes filled with so many thousands of
names that its purpose becomes moot since no one is going to remember
them all as scammers. Besides that, all scammers do the actual scams
with disposeable twinks and either partners or two accounts. You'd
have a board of now erased characters. 

Besides, anyone who bothers to go to such a page is more easily helped
by just outlining the ways to NOT be scammed:

1) When selling an item the person with the item always hands that
over first, since items have no drop confirmation (although verant is
making money no drop anyway I guess soon = (  bleah) 

2) Never make a trade based upon a phantom third party object. This is
the oldest scam in the game and in fact also in real life. In this
scam you are auctioning that you want to trade an idol of the thorned
for something else and a person overhears you in the zone you are in.
They say that they have this third other thing, but that if you buy it
for (insert unbelievebly fortunate price here for the item you'd be
trading it for while its the REGULAR HIGH PRICE of the item you are
actually buying) that this other guy will trade you the thing you want
to trade the idol of the thorned for in exchange. So you buy the third
thing from this "disinterested third party" at about its maximum
market high price (but which would seem like a very good deal for the
thing you want) then when you go to contact either party they are both
gone. 

There are various variations of that scam but its always the same and
involving some third party. Never, never, never ever complete a trade
like this assuming that someone else will then trade you a thing for
what you just bought. Also it makes no difference if the one party
introduced you or not, since another way of doing it is the third
party being in the same zone as the other guy and suddenly auctioning
to trade (the thing you want) for the thing the other guy wants to
sell. 

Basically what I'm saying is that listing all the scams is more
valueble than listing names of scammers, who are almost ALWAYS
disposable twinks anyway (no scammers scam with their main) The rule
is if it ever involves a third party don't do it, always exchange the
item first, never trade in bags, etc.
