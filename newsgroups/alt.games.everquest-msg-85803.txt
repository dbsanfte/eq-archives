Most groups would still rather have a rogue or monk.  Mana damage,
even if a show-stopper, can't be sustained, clarity or not.  Monks and
rogues don't have that problem.  Other than raid-type situations
where you don't care about efficiency ("we're going to pull this mob
when everyone is buffed and FoM, kill it, divvy up loot and go home")
or places where evacs are needed, wizards are going to have a very
difficult time finding groups.

Wizards are great at damage/second.  Monks and rogues are the
masters of damage/time.   That leads to a very specialized role
for wizards, partially offset by the gain a group gets in travel.
Except for the planes (obviously) and a few other "gotta have an
evac or we're not going" locations, a wizard can expect to LFG
for a while.   And since none of the LFG places are in the planes
or in places where evac is required, that ends up with a lot of
time LFG and/or soloing.
