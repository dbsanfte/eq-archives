Actually, I am a newbie. Brand new with a number of level 1 characters 
all just about to start on on Stromm. But I am wondering now if it 
wouldn't be fun to reroll them on this new server. Then again, maybe I 
should just stay on Stromm.

Anyone have any thoughts on this new server vs. Stromm for somebody who 
really is brand new? Thanks.
