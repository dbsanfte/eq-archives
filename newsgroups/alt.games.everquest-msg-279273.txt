Heh :)

As a corporate Systems and Network Scurity professional, I can say this
is actually the correct way to do things: lock everything down, both
ways, then poke holes as neccessary.  This gives the proper authorities
the ability to say what services may or may not be used on the company
(or school) network.  Approved activities, such as web-browsing, go
through, while dissapproved activities, such as file swapping or game
playing, do not.  Likewise, it also prevents unwanted incomming
connections, such as worms, from infecting the network, or in the event
a worm does somehow become introduced, greatly reduces if not
preventing it from spreading across network boundaries.

There's more to it than that. ssh (port 22, not 443; 443 is https, but
properly configured either will work) tunnelling only supports and
forwards TCP packets, not UDP.  This is fine for the patcher, which
uses TCP, however EverQuest itself uses a wide range of randomly
assigned UDP ports.  I ran into precisely this problem when setting up
my house firewall.  While UDP-over-TCP wrappers exist, using such
wrappers for the purpose of forwarding the EverQuest UDP packets over a
TCP connection, as mentioned elsewhere, introduces such a tremendous
ammount of latency as to render the connection useless for playing the
game.

While it's doubtful that you will ever convince your Network Admin to
arbitrarily open all state-established UDP connections over port 1023
(as this opens the network to being an out-going source of network
nasties), this is what needs to happen to realize your dream.
