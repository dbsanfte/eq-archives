Focus effects work like haste. The best itemeffect of a type and the best
buff of a type stack. Bard Songs might stack but who knows :).

Having an Anger of E'ci item and a summoned bracelet means on ice nukes only
the Anger triggers and bracelet is skipped. Having 2 items with the same
effect means the one in the lowest slot is triggered and the other ignored
(all inventory slots have a number, check the xml file if you want to know
what they are).
