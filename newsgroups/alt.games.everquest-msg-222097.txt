PC is strictly a levelling fast lane. With the average level of twinking 
present, all strategy goes right out the window in favor of keeping the 
body count maxxed. People bind right outside the zoneline so when they 
die (they can pretty much count on it at some point), they just run right 
back into the fray.

That zone has just extended the level max. before tactics become 
necessary to 25.
