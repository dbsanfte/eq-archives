I did not find teen levels difficult at all with my Troll Shaman on
Test.  If you get a decent weapon (say 1:3 ratio or better) and the
best AC you can manage you'll find that you can be quite the "tank
mage" in those levels.  From around L5 on I fought in FoB until the
xp mobs started taking too much effort to kill, moved into Kurns
where the mobs were about the same, but none of them had poison and
the ZEM helps.  Fought in Kurns until 16ish, then moved to OT for
a change of scenery, xp was a little slower but at least the mobs
didn't all look the same and there's a PoK book right there when
you want to sell off, see a trainer, or just go somewhere else.
Also hunted some in EK in high teens, Carrion Spiders dropped more
silk than I had remembered (a lot more) and quality cat skins plus
the silks added some coin to my pockets.  All-in-all the xp and the
pp were both pretty darned easy from L8 (yay Meditate!) on (he's
now 22 and I usually two-box or group when I've played him since 20).
