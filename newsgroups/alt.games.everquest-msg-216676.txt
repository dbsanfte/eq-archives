Rat meat is not "food"

Right click it  and it says underneath if it is food or drink, like
what kind of meal it is.

The biggest kind of food that people "trash" or sell, probably not
knowing it is food is:

Chunk of meat.

Chunk of meat has been around since the beta and has always been food.
Many people have trashed it not knowing this.
