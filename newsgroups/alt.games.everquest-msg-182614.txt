Very nice indeed, great job. Excellent imagery, and a solid, pounding 
beat. Very inspiring. So inspiring, in fact, that I can't help but try 
my hand at it too :)


Pick your prey, choose with care
Don't want it too strong or too hard to snare.
Get four of the same, let them follow you
And get ready to show'em what a Druid can do.

Crumpled leaves, trampled grass,
the quadkite cluster through here did pass.
A snare is resisted time and time again
and this way begins an unholy train.

So close to you you can smell their hate
Too close for Egress and too close for Gate
ten mobs on your tail, so what can you do?
Dump them on somebody, for we do that too.

Hand on the hilt or nose in the book,
With no time to move, with no time to look.
Wrong time and wrong place, victims of bad luck,
In their frozen mouths the words "What the f...?"
