Poor use of the QUOTE feature... WTF? Dont quote the whole post to add one
single line to it. Especially when it has no content.

As to Druids and Kiting and all that crap... let me equate it to the AWP in
Counter-Strike... yeah? It's a "pussy" gun? hahah Well I just shot your head
off with it from 300 yards.  Who's still alive? Woot!

Anyway.. more to get back on topic.  Every class has good and bad.  Warriors
do some lame crap, casters cast some lame crap, necromancers are lame crap..
you know how it goes.  Who cares.  Get a style you like, you're comfortable
with and then pay the consequences. :)
