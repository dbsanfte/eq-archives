I'll let you know today. :-)
It's very doubtful that FedSex (/rude) will get my card here prior to
the servers coming back up at 11:00 a.m. our time.  That being the case,
we'll most likely try to have Luclin up and running on our old 16 MB
cards. It will either work or it won't. If not, I'll shut off all the
graphics, etc. and play that way until the cards arrive, then install
and try turning them on again. If it actually handles it and runs fine,
I'll likely still install the new cards, having already ordered them.
Can't hurt.... much.
