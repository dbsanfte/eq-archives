Inner Circle awoke The Sleeper on Tuesday night

All high guilds had an agreement to not awaken the sleeper to continue to
equip Primal weapons which are essential for high end encounters and would
give the few up and coming guilds a chance to fight the warders.

Inner Circle did this out of spite, just as any spoilt children do in real
life when they have tantrums.

Another guild beat Inner Circle to a high end Luclin mob so Inner Circle
decided to spite this guild (and everyone else) by denying them any more
Primals and gathered forces and awoke the Sleeper.

Sure they have a right to do what they want but there were guilds who could
of awoken him long time ago but didn't out of respect for everyone else.

Inner Circle are now even more the pariahs of Xegony.
