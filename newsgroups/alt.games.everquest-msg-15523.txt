Last I read they disabled that .asp for external use because lots of folks
were using it (it was/is a very nice program) and it became a bandwidth hog.
You could customize it for different servers and skin colors, etc, much like

I've not heard of one that will scan for player names online, though I'd
welcome such a utility.
