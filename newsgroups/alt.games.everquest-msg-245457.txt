What an awesome post. It cleared up a lot of stuff for me. So essentially,
the whole problem could have been avoided by a better programming standard.
Having 255 as the maximum, it seems like it would have been easy enough to
change that to a long int or whatever (been a long time since i programmed)
and export the existing character records into the new format.

Oh well, what's done is done. From what I gather, a monk with really good
gear is still valued, so mebbe I can 'twink' my monk with ornate or
something by grouping with my druid. Some of the pieces (boot and helmet)
are very cheap but the others are painfully out of reach. One day hopefully!
