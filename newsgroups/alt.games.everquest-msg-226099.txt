My warrior has an ornate helm when he is wearing it  , it appears as if he
has no
helm at all.  I would like to have this same look for my Rogue ...but all
the helms
he wears have a graphic.   Is there a way to  dye a piece of armor so it
won't  show
up on the character?  Many of the head pieces are truly ugly and it would be
nice to have
the stats , and yet have the bare headed look.

              Thanks
