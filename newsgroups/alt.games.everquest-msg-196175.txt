I'm in Southern Armada on Prexus. Mostly Aussies and raids at a time
convenient to people in that timezone. Several NZ'ers and we exiled the
guild leader there... or was that his company who did that? I forget.

I remember talking with some NZ app, told him the guild leader was
in NZ as well and a while later get a tell "Damnit, he's just round
the corner, going over for a beer and chat now".

There's also "Jesters of Fate" somewhere, another aussie guild I
think.
