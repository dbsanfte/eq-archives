This post is aimed at non-cartography geeks.

http://maps.eq-toolbox.com

All you do is download the zip file, then unzip it in to your everquest\maps
folder.  Choose "YES" when it asks you if you want to overwrite the file
already there.

Once you're in game you'll need to change the window Normal and Fade levels
to 40 or 50 or  else you won't be able to see the lines (instructions in a
sec).

Also, hit that Height Filter button on the map screen...turn it off,
otherwise you'll only be able to see parts of the map that are at your
altitude (3rd number on /loc) and very very few zones are level.

Regarding the fade/normal level, hit Backspace to open your map, then
right-click on the top bar of that window.  Choose...err...I think it's the
Alpha choice (like 2nd or 3rd thing on the menu) then that opens another
menu for Normal and Fade.  That's what you need to change.

For the cartography geeks I'm fully aware that you can change the line
colors and fully aware that you can adjust the altitude values so that you
don't have to turn off the height filter, but all that's too much work
unless you enjoy that type of thing.

Heh, and I'm fully aware those same cart geeks haven't read down this far in
their rush to "correct" my first few paragraphs. :p
