I can agree mostly, apart from one small thing which I think you yourself
point out in another post.  And that is it shouldn't be required for players
who have played EQ up to now to upgrade, seeing as this is 'just an
expansion'.  You will notice that people who want to play the original
Wolfenstein are not forced to upgrade if they don't want to play Version 2.
Aside from this, there are many people who are having trouble even though
they meet the specifications yet Verant says (oh, and now you tell us),
'ummm, we don't support that type of hardware'.  If you haven't seen the EQ
Tech Support Board recently let me tell you it is VERY UGLY.

Yeah, I think once all the problems are sorted out it is gonna be great, and
personally though I am one of these ones that can't get in without being
bugged I think Luclin will be great.  But unless Verant get it sorted out
quick, and more importantly get it sorted out WELL, then I think it will
cost them.  I have already seen so many people saying they are cancelling
their accounts I have lost count.  It comes down to poor testing, poor
pre-release information, poor support, and in short, trying to get a good
product out too quick because of competitive pressure.
