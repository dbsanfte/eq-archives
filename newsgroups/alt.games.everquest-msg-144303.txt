The cleric AC line of buffs overwrites it, for one, as will
various shaman buffs, and various shaman debuffs will remove
it as well if you're fighting shaman-type mobs.  And mage
debuffs as well, but I can't think of any mage-type mobs that
cast debuffs.

It's pretty much a non-issue if you're an INT caster because
you'll either not get buffed by the cleric/shaman (other than
the HP/AC buffs which don't overwrite it) or you'd prefer to
have their better buffs anyway.

For melee-types, it's great for soloing and useless in groups
unless the only priest class is a druid (none of their spells
overwrite the line except their self-only '-coat' line.)

It's fairly easy to check stacking issues for yourself on Lucy
