I'm really open on race and class. I was thinking that Friona Vie server
personally... That's the new RP based one where there is no common tongue,
and with alignments, no?

Since unfriendly races can't really party up there, I would suggest all
starting as humans with a generally good alignment... But I'm really open to
all ideas. I'd like a serious dedicated party yes... Like from 8-11
Wednesdays, and maybe an hour here and there as we could agree on it via
email.
