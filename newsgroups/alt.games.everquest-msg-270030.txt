    Interesting article.  It did seem seem to have the sorta generic feel
of someone who has researched the phenomena rather than write from first
hand experience, but that doesn't make it bad, imho.  I was particularly
interested that the article ends on the note that Microsoft's Xbox Live
uses a player rating system, and that seems to work well.  Such a thing has
been suggested on this newsgroup several times before, but the general
consensus seems to be that griefers would use that as a tool to punish good
players by giving out bad ratings.

    Seems that it might work, though, at least for the Xbox Live crowd (if
the article is correct).  Perhaps the actual ratio of griefers is pretty
low, and they get weeded out before they can have much of an impact in
their attempts to abuse the system.  If it is correct, I might actually
have to revise my opinion about how a rating system in MMORPGs might work.
