DT, how is it my responsibility that these people create out of thin
air some sort of "pressure to respond"?

Please reread my question and your response and then:
1) define reasonable for me, as it appears that you mean something
entirely different than I do when using that word, and then
2) tell me just where it is that I assert a "beleif that it can't
possibly be rude"?

Tell me, what makes it a "perfectly valid analogy"? assuming such a
thing can possibly exist (analogies are famously slippery beasties).
While your describing its perfection, please be sure to address how
it is superior to, let's say, an open "kegger" party (with a cover
charge <g>), which would be quite a lot closer to the EQ environment
than "a bar" and yet still substantially different.

Um, ok, if you say so.

Glad to hear it.

AFAIK I have not been rude to you in-game.  And I am quite certain that
I have never chosen "to stand there and bark at me that you're no
being rude".

I'm not sure just what you mean here, but I do take care to respond
couteously to most everybody in game.  There are exceptions, of course,
but none of them involve people I'm seeking to exchange favors with.

Tell that to my (or anybody else's) children.  Yes, I am completely
serious BTW.

In your opinion, I disagree.

Excuse me?  Claiming that your attempt to put words in my mouth is
"removing your spin-doctoring" has got to be one of the most absurd
assertions you've ever made to this group.

DT, you're throwing the strawmen themselves in an attempt to
support an argument that is itself at root a strawman.  /tell
ain't ringing the telephone on your kitchen wall, or even close
to it.  "care to trade SoW for an AC buff?" while you're medding
ain't an aluminum siding salesman interrupting your family dinner
or even close to it.  EQ ain't a_bar_01, or even close to it.
I've tried to describe my position and my behavior as clearly as
possible in my last post to the other subthread of our argument.
And whether you agree with me or not, the whole damned thing is
effectively moot anyway, the game isn't gonna change even slightly
because of what we post here.
