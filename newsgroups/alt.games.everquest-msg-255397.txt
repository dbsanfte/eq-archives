I agree James. I think what many people argue is that Joe Solo cannot get
that item if he puts in 50 hours, or 500 hours, or 5000. He simple has NO
CHANCE unless he is also interested in the raiding way of playing the
game.

Actually, not true, since those raiders have gear that make their soloing
and raiding more effective.  Those who do not raid-obtained gear have to
compensate for poorer equipment with better grasp of the nuancse of their
class if they want to be as effective.  If the raiders happen to also
possess such skill...well..the non-raiders are gonna be feeling the burn.
It's just life.

Not saying they (raiders) don't solo or group, but just that your argument
for why they are more adept players is faulty.

You started out trying to be level headed and quickly ended up just
frothing at the mouth and shouting insults like the next guy.

Raiding these days takes commitment and skill.  I believe it. I've read
Monual's reports.  I've followed raid sites.  It's not as "sheople-y" as
casuals want to think it is.

Grouping and soloing takes time commitment and skill as well.  These
work hard as well, and are no way "inferior" to the raiders.  They have as
much right to meaningful content as raiders do. If they want raid-level
equipment without raiding, however, or without 10 times the time
commitment, then they are being silly.
