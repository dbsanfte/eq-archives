Good points there Xevbear:

To answer your questions - yes, I'm able to cast a large amount of
conventional nukes during the encounters that we have. With my 4K mana pool
I can cast 8 Sunstrikes, 13 Ice Spears or 12 Lures of Ice. The Lure might
stick as it should - but the Sunstrike and Ice Spear gets resisted a lot -
way too many times to even bother casting - hence my desire to find out
about Manaburn.

We do manage to kill our mobs, but as I've mentioned we're not a large
guild, and we're currently only fighting what must be considered to be small
mobs these days. VS, VRS, Velkator, Fay and so on. I never nuke until the
mob is down to 80% anyway - I space out my casting so as not to pull the
agro away from the tanks.

It's very hard to know what to do with my points.

Regards,

Stevie.
