Any idea why  the setup program runs another program that wants to act
as a server ?
Strange for an in game colour editor to require this., hmmm.

Well I ran it and I obviously didn't allow it to act as a server, and
guess what it doesn't work. Interesting, any code hackers like to tell
us what it's doing.

To those that run EQ and don't use a firewall, beware
