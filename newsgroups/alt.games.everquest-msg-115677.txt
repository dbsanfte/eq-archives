They don't announce when/where because people would fill up the zone and
crash it.  It a hit or miss situation.  You'll either be in the right zone
when it happens or you may here what zone it is from other players.  And if
it isn't an all-out slaughterfest, there's always some d00ds who ruin the
event by attacking the NPCs.
