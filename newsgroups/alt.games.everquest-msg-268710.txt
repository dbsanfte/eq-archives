You'll probably get flamed as a fanboi for this post.  =)

As I am impervious (damn near oblivious) to flames, and still playing EQ
anyway, I'll toss in that I went to pick up a printer cartridge the other
day at the local CompUSA and did my stroll down the games aisle.  Not only
did they have probably 50 (or more) copies of EQ2, they had a couple dozen
copies of the collectors edition.  I wanted to compare that to WoW, but
couldn't find it on the shelves at all, not even a price tag.  I asked at
the checkout and the guy pointed to a stack of a half dozen copies sitting
behind the customer service desk and he said "Somebody's going to get an ear
full if all the people that preordered come to get their copies and find out
we've already sold all of them by accident."

I didn't ask how many of each they got shipped, which is obviously a factor. 
I'd love to see some sales numbers nationwide.
