Both the Royal Attendant line from Takish and the Melevolent line from
Mirigul's are excellent for Clerics. I've been mixing and matching
from the two sets.

The Royal Attendant stuff from Takish goes for 1492 a piece, the
Melevolent stuff from Mirigul's is 760 per piece. For any particular
slot, there is usually one of the two that is supperior for a Cleric.
Where they are similar (the breastplates for example) I'm going with
the cheaper item. All the pieces from both camps have augs slots type
1, 2, and 3.
