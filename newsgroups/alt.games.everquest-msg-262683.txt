Not really, if the effort to obtain them is removed, the benefits of the
item still exist (such as the damage, stat buffs, etc).

How does what somebody else does cheapen your efforts?  You and your
friends still know that you went through everything to get the Epic.  If
somebody else doesn't have the time to go through all the hoops, but has
$50 to drop on an item, why should they not be entitled to it the same
as people with the time to get it?

Your effort wasn't lessened at all.  You know you earned it, as do your
friends.  The people who dropped money for it either want a nice piece
of equipment and can't be bothered with 'earning' it, or for bragging
rights.  If you talk to the people who have that piece of equipment, it
should be obvious in a hurry which group that person belongs to.

It is not that easy of a problem to fix.  There are people who can
devote the time required to go on raids or camp the appropriate spots
for countless hours, while others simply can't.  The way people in game
are affected is by the parasites camping the spots where those items
drop to sell them for real money.  I think Mary has a great solution -
have the game owner sell the items; that will keep the spawn points
clear for people who can devote the time to the game, while still
enabling those that don't another option to obtain them.
