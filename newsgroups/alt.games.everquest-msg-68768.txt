The past two nights I've spent a total of about ten hours in
Shadeweaver's Thicket, testing tailoring recipes.

There has been a good population of folks in the zone with me (as high
as 75 at one point tonight).

These people aren't sitting around chatting - they're playing. You
know, running around, killing stuff, doing quests, that sort of thing.

The playability of the game is absolutely NOT non-existent.
