I played an enchanter from about low 40s up to 60 via LDoNs.  I saw it
all... people who had no idea what mez was, rangers who insisted on
"off-tanking", cloth-wearers who wanted werewolf or scarecrow forms,
people who had never learned how to assist, casters who didn't
understand that their AoE's broke mez, people who waited until after I
cast a group buff (that I announced several times in advance) to tell
me that I needed to cast it again, etc etc etc. 

So I have plenty of sympathy.  What my wife did was gradually build up
a solid list of firends.  We had a core group that got together almost
every time we were on, and she had a short list of others that really
liked playing with us, so we could usually put most of a group
together that way.  

Of course, occasionally we'd get someone where the "Danger, Will
Robinson" bell went off almost instantly, but even then, group
pressure from the other members could usually bring them in line.

Anyway, good luck, and have fun... I loved LDoNs.  And you can work up
to some really nice loot from the LDoN merchants.
