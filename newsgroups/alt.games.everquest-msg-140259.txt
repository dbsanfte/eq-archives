> 5 - See 2 mobs, go for the pull, get 3 adds and discover that you
> cannot split them, so run to your group instead of the zone.
> 4 - Decide you can zip through a 50+ zone without invis... after all
> the exit is "just around the corner"
> 3 - Wait until you are down to 1/2 bubble of health before thinking
> "hmm, maybe I should run"... splat!
> 2 - Wisely counter 200+ hits with your AWESOME 90 point heal.
> 1 - Stand on the top of a wizard spires and announce to the zone "Hey
> ya'll, watch this!" Then realize halfway down that you never bought
> any batwings.
