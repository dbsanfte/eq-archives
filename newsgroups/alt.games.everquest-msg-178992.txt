Focus Effect  Affliction Efficiency 4 ( and lower ) that use to work on
mezmerizations, roots, and tashes appearantly no longer works for them.  It
wasn't in the patch message, which makes me wonder if this is what was even
intended.
I'm sure I'm not the only enchanter who is pretty upset over this.  Talked
to a GM about this on chat, and according to this GM it was Ninja nerfed.
guides on the other hand have bugged this.  If they are going to nerf
something they should at least make a note of it in the patch messages,
otherwise it makes you think its bugged.
This item now is similiar to the abakular box, first nerfed then changed
back.  I'm not super happy with the item now, and when I dump it, they could
easily change it back.  I know people who dumped the box only to have it
change back.
