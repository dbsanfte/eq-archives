That's an easy one to answer.  It causes the following...
1. Barbarian Warrior discovers just how nightblind he is when trying
something even as easy as leaving Everfrost to Blackburrow.
2. He finds a good 2H slasher and is now unable to hold a very good light
source while carrying his weapon in dangerous caves.
3. He learns of a quest from the Qeynos Warrior guild that gives a bracer
that also acts as a light source.
4. He heads for Qeynos to get the quest.
5. He discovers that he has very low faction and is unable to get the quest.
6. He discovers that by handing in gnoll teeth he can raise his faction.
7a. He tries to raise faction but discovers this is taking too long and he
is not getting gnoll teeth fast enough, and leveling too fast. He kills the
lower LV gnolls, get a few teeth, now they're green so they stop dropping
teeth and he must loot this NO DROP item from higher LV gnolls...process
repeats until he is higher LV, and now that he has increased faction high
enough, he is too high LV to get the quest mobs to drop the needed items to
complete the quest.
7b. He tries to raise faction but after seeing how long it will take to get
enough of these NO DROP items, he learns he will be of too high LV for the
rest of the quest by then, so heads off to Freeport for the belt quest which
raises faction far faster for less EXP gain required. This works, but at a
low enough LV to still complete the Qeynos quest, he either has a hard time
with corpse runs to get to Freeport and back, or has to find a porter to
give him a lift for free or a few gold.
7c. He spends countless hours letting others kill the gnolls, and if a tooth
is on the corpse, pays them to not loot it but to let him wait the 120
seconds needed to allow him to loot this NO DROP item.
8. Either way if he is unable to do this quest, he gets to a higher LV and
realizes how much he really should have done it to get this wearable
lightsource for caves, and other dark areas (and just for at night).
