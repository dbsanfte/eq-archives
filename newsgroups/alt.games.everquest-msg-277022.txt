if you click on the "show details" button just under where the update 
progress bars are it'll tell you what the problem is ... sometimes it's a 
corrupt file that stops the updater ... just find and delete it then restart 
the patcher. If it's just network timeouts then there isn't much you can do 
except keep trying :(
