Klandicar, Sontalaak, Telkorenor, etc.

I know you say it doesn't apply to Talendor, and I've only fought him once
so I can't speak with authority on the fight, but my perma-51 ranger has
fought Nagafen probably 50 times, and keeps a clicky going in first buff
slot, and has never once lost any more than the first 3 buffs.  When I
fought Talendor that one time, I remember thinking "Nagafen part 2".  :)
