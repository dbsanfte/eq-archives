Gonna post this in the meantime while I search google and linksys, but here
is my question.

I have 2 computers (sometimes more) I normally use on my network.  They are
connected by a Linksys Cable Router and I would like for each computer to
have seperate IP addresses so that I can play different online games
together.  Currently both computers share the same IP address and some games
will only allow 1 IP address per online session, which is my reason for
having a different one.  Any hints on how to get this done?

Thanks, Danny
