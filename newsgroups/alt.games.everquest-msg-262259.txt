The scary part is, I have so much experience, and I still run into 
someone once or twice a month that just makes me want to curl up in a 
ball and cry. For example,  I met this presidential candidate in 1999...

ur nevermind.

I think my best one in the last couple of months has to be the machine 
that came in for us to setup the net on. (We knew the guy, we were not 
even going to TRY to do this over the phone). Set his fairly new HP 
a###w machine (the w on the end of the model number, btw, means it is a 
'special' (as in short bus) machine made even cheaper than normal for 
sale at Wal Mart) on the table, reach back and start connecting cables 
blind: Modem, sound should be that jack, power, video... there's a hole 
in the back where the back plane should be....

Look back there:
The entire back plane (little 8x2 inch metal plate that the keyboard, 
mouse, and motherboard junk is passed through. It's setup so they can 
use the same basic case and just stamp out the plate for the specific 
motherboard they have...) is gone. Mind you it sticks in from the 
inside, and is held in by the motherboard. Also, the vga connector is 
just 14 little female board pins (they leave one off), the plastic 
shroud has been ripped from the motherboard. We call the customer, get 
him to bring his monitor in, sure enough, the backplane and connector 
are dangling from the end.

Would you believe he expected us to fix it, rather than adding a video card?

Would you believe we actually did? (fit the little plastic connector 
over the pins, took about 20 min, and superglued it down, unscrewed the 
bolts to make sure he couldn't screw the monitor cable into it. After 
talking to HP it comes out a 'known issue' that the silly thing won't 
work properly with an add on video card).

Would you believe he had the gall to get pissy with us over us charging 
him for fixing it?

I wouldn't believe it either. But it happened. I'm serious... I can't 
make stuff like this up, my imagination is not that good.
