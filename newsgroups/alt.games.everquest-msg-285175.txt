From the alt.games.everquest FAQ:

   7.3    Q: Can I post about EQ II on alt.games.everquest?

   A:  If the post pertains only to EQ II, it would be better
   to post it on alt.games.everquest2, or on Sony's EQ2 forums.
   Posts comparing EQ II to EQ Live are fair game, just like
   comparisons to any other MMORPG.  If you do post here about
   EQ II, it's considered polite to include EQ2 somewhere in
   the subject to make sure people know which game you're
   talking about.  If you don't, you should accept your
   inevitable chastisement.  For a while, some folks marked
   posts about EverQuest Live (the "original" EverQuest) with
   "EQ1", but this practice dropped off once most EQ2 traffic
   moved elsewhere.

To answer your actual question, sure, many of the people who visit
this board play EQ2.  They continue to visit this board because they
used to play EQ1 and want to share their knowledge or just keep tabs
on the community, or because they still play EQ1 also.  But you don't
see much *discussion* of EQ2 here because this isn't really the place
for it.

I admit that alt.games.everquest2 doesn't seem very active, according
to Google Groups, so I'm guessing the Sony forums are a better bet.
But I don't play EQ2 myself so I don't really know.

Ob-EQ1: According to mmogchart.com, yes, someone still plays EQ2. :)
Indeed, that chart suggests subscriptions to both EQs took a nose dive
over the past year, but EQ1 got hit harder, such that there almost as
many people now playing EQ2 as EQ1.  As always, people are free to
debate the accuracy of the numbers presented on that site.
