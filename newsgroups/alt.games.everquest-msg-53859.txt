> One guy offered me 7 Plat if I'd make him a FP breastplate.

Hehe, had 2 gnomes in Steamfont begging me, and when i refuse they told me
i was lying and demanded my FB bracer i was selling.
What a gnome want with a troll size FP bracer is beyond me.

Hehe, your lucky if they only demand material price. When i was doing
heavy tradeskills it happened around 4 times a week that people made fun
of my prices and said that the normal price was actually BELOW the
material cost. Luckily most of the time some other persons in zone know
the price on making it, and start making fun of the complaining moron.
You can also have problems because of vendor prices. If a tailor ONLY
tailoring for shawl quest sell his stuff to a vendor, the vendor sell it
back a lot cheaper than any players would. When a full set of Wu armor
sold for 1200pp on my server, people could still find it for 40pp a item
at vendors if they were lucky.
Even worse for Small Wisdom Deitys. They still go for around 150pp, but if
someone sell to a vendor it only cost 2pp to buy, and for a LOT of people
cheapest price seen on any player or vendor = market price.

Ahh, dont we just love the persons that start callign you names because
you wont take his 22 items in trade for your Knuckle Dusters.

I make for free in 3 situations:
RL friends, Guild, I skill up on making the item, and then only if player
pay all material cost.

It cost a few K in loss to be able to make FP armor, and easily 10K to be
able to make Wu armor. And not to mention the time to learn tradeskills
(especially tailoring)
If people think that the reason my 47 druid have 58 day playing time is
because i learned to do tradeskills for them for free they're insane. You
dont pay, you learn tradeskills yourself.
