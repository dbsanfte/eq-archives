Yes, it works, at home I've got 3-4 computers doing this, and at one of my
friends house we've got 3 computers doing this, both on cable connections.
At home there *might* be one account running, at my friends we've had up to
4 going at the same time (with the necessary 4th computer).   Only issue
with 3+ accounts running at the same time on 3+ computers over one cable
connection is that if we're all in the same zone (particularly Kael) after
about 2-2.5 hours our ISP feels the need to be a jackass and perform a 10
minute "bandwidth excession" disconnect, which it then repeats every time
all 3 of us log back in at the same time.
