   Was it really necessary to quote the whole 100+ line post to add one little
snide remark?  

   For most of EQ, play BST was not possible, therefore no mention.  Now, I
would say that its also appropriate to leave them off.  They are neither "hot"
or "not".  A few people play them, but not scores upon scores making up a large
percentage of the playerbase.  OTOH, they aren't exactly shunned, either.
