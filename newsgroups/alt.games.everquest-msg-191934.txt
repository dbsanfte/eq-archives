err, right. To correct my wording, they all "see" your religion. But
your religion doesn't matter to all factions. Cleric, Paladin, SK, and
Necromancer NPCs are the main ones to look out for. Some are on those
factions, but aren't obvious by appearance that they are. Such as a
random single guard in one of the Neriak sections...
