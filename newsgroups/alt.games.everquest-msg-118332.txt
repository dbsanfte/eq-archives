And the above is called "ignorant bullshit"...

Depends on the area, actually... This is why the "reputable" escort
services will can one of their escorts so fast they won't know what
hit them if they found out any of them got "intimate" with their
clients during a "date".

Actually, they can can your account even without solid evidence. Hell,
they can cancel your account because they don't like the city you live
in...

Then what does it matter whether or not they can prove or catch you in
the act of paying for the services? Oops...

No, the breech of contract with Verant comes when you pay that person
RL money...

Like I said, trading in-game items is perfectly fine as long as that
is ALL that is being exchanged for the in-game goods and services. I
note you conveniently fail to mention the cash you're also paying for
these services. And don't throw that "the money is for their time"
tripe at me, it doesn't work.

No it's not, because exchanging stolen goods is never legal. Having
sex in itself is legal. It's when real money or items are given in
payment for the sex that it becomes illegal.
