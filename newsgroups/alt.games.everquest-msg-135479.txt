Since the Bazaar is open, I'm gonna do some shopping for some cleric
gear. I have under 1000pp to spend...can't remember exactly how
much...and I'd like to improve what I'm wearing in the face, head,
wrist, shoulder, back, and feet slots. I really don't care if I spend
a bit on several slots or blow the whole wad (modest wad that it is)
on one slot, as long as I get decent value for my pp.

I'm not a really hard-core player, so I don't have a good feel for the
equipment available to me and its value. So I'm hoping I can get some
suggestions from you folks.

Thanks.

Daneel
