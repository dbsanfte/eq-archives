Right click "My Computer", then click "Properties"
Click on "Device Manager" tab.
Look for the "Creative" listing (not under "Sound, video and game
controllers", seperat listing.
Right click on "Creative" and there will be a few items there (the live
drive controls), don't remember exact listing, but I can e-mail them to you.
Highlight them, click properties, then click disable.

After intermittant crashing that started on 04 Dec 01, and got alot worse
after 10 Jan 02 patch, I disabled the Live Drive and can finally enjoy
uninterrupted game play again ! HUAH !
