To some extent I agree; there *are* differences
in physical characteristics between the races.
Caucasians are less likely to be lactose-intolerant
than south-east asians (to choose a resoundingly
noncontroversial example).

However, this form of racism only really becomes
a problem when applied as a *general* statement
rather than indicating an average. On average,
perhaps, certain races may run faster, or see further,
or even be smarter.

However, racist attitudes are usually that *all* people
of a particular race are faster, or smarter, or have
better vision. They also usually ignore environmental
factors - maybe caucasians (or asians, or whatever)
average better in exams, but given a better diet or more
leisure to study, or any number of other factors, the
reverse might prove to be true.

In practice the average differences between the races
are swamped by environmental factors and the
regular variation between people - the fact that some
people are extraordinary, some are... not, but most fall
in a big lump somewhere in the middle. And there's
*enormous* overlap in that lump.

Agree, pretty much. Note that you're arguing with a
dictionary defnition, not mine. I would have phrased
that definition a little differently, but doing so could
easily play into the hands of those who think that minor
differences in race make a person automatically superior.

Not sure if I would say "racial [sic] specific" though. Can't
think of a single characteristic or ability over which any
one race holds a monopoly.

I'm not a big fan of PC myself.

However, recognising the existence of racism, and
recognising that oversensitivity is crippling the expression
of thought, are two different things.

There *are* circumstances under which affirmative action
is justified. However, the all-or-nothing approach taken
by many institutions these days in the pursuit of political
correctness is fostering a atmosphere of fear and resentment.

Unfortunately with PC the line has to be drawn *somewhere*
and tertiary institutions tend to draw it somewhere ridiculously
restrictive to reduce the odds of lawsuits and such. :-(

I'm a "call a spade a spade" sort of person myself, which
is one reason why I butted into this debate in the first
place. Affirmative Action *is* a form of applied racism.
Anybody denying that is only deluding themselves.
Ditto anybody who denies that *on*average* there are
differences between the races. However, discriminating
between two people on the basis of race (or anything
else, pretty much) is denying the fact that those averages
are overwhelmed by normal statistical variability when
considered on an *individual* basis.

It's that sort of denial which leads to most of what we
call "racism".

(Side note: my previous post focussed on the second
definition, which was extremely straightforward. The
first is much trickier. But it's not my definition, it's the
dictionary's.)
