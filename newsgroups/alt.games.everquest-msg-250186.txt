Yes.

For Kunark, Sebilis was a massive pain to get to.    Every time you wanted
to go there, you had to find a druid or wizard to port you to Dreadlands,
then run with you across half of Dreadlands to get to Karnors castle, where
the person had to port you a second time to get to Emerald Jungle.  From
there, you had to cross one medium sized zone (EJ) and the entire length of
an extremely large zone (Trak's Teeth).   Then you could enter Sebilis,
assuming  you had done the key quest.

Even during Velious it was still hard to get to.  They removed the
restrictions on EJ port so you could do it from anywhere, but you still had
to pay someone to port you and then run across two large zones.

For the entire length of those two expansions, Sebilis was overcrowded every
single night.   Every Single Night.   Every camp would be taken.  Because it
was the "best" experience/loot single group zone in the game.  Even during
Luclin it was still busy for experience, although by then the loot was no
longer exciting, except for its vendor sale value.

The only difference that being "hard to reach" added was a feeling that you
were locked into it.  The huge travel time added a disincentive to leave,
since so much time and (and often money) had gone into reaching the place.
If you couldn't get a group, you sat at the entrance and waited for a spot
to open or a new group to form.  Leaving and running to Velks, Karnors or
Chardok was not an option, since you knew it would just mean you spent your
entire night running around and never actually killing anything.
