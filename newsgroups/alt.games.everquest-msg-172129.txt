Well, we were an exp group. The item in question is a rare drop from a rare 
mob- it is occasionally camped, but for the most part it is a chance 
occurrence. So we both got our primary objective- experience.

The camp we were in is unimportant. If I were exping in, say, Velks, and 
SCHW dropped, I would easily give them to someone with no haste or lower 
haste. It's not like we were sitting around killing Hadden or something.
