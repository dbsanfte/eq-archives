tell me about it! My druid has been earning her stuff, and I am
getting upset that nothing changes! She bought a Slitpaw tunic, and
her torso color changed. Whoopee. I have been hunting the Warrens off
and on for a bit, as the Wicker stuff turns her green, and ain't too
bad ac. Pretty light too, surprised I haven't seen more monks hunting
it. My level 7 iksar is travelling there now. Good hunting, good bind
spots nearby, good faction with every kill, nice loot. Why not?
