I Don't Believe In Love
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

(Chris De Garmo/Geoff Tate)

I awoke on impact
Under surveillence of the camera eye
Searching high and low
The criminal mind found at the scene of the crime
Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it
she said she loved me
I guess I never knew
But do we ever, ever really know?
She said she'd meet me on the other side
But I knew right then, I'd never find her

CHORUS
I don't believe in love
I never have, I never will
I don't believe in love
It's never worth the pain that you feel

No more nightmares, I've seen them all
Frome daay I was born, they've haunted my every move
Every open hand's there to push and shove
No tie for love, it doesn't matter
She made a difference
I guess she had a way
Of making every night seem bright as day
Now I walk in sahdows, never see th light
She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye

CHORUS

I don't believe in love
I'll just pretend she never was real
I don't believe in love
I need to forget her face, I see it still

No chance for contact
There's no raison d'etre
My only hope is one day I'll forget
The pain of knowing what can never be
With or without love it's all the same to me

CHORUS
