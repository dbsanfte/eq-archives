Clerics can kill single Dark Blue mobs very reliably over the 1 to 62 level range, I
can't say for certain that they can till 65 but I'm reasonably sure that they can
since the extension of 61-65 dark blue range; I stopped soloing at 62 but that was in
part because mobs I could kill went light blue due to the rapid attenuation of the DB
level range post 60 thats since been changed.

We aren't talking a well equipped cleric, either, I was at best in some Kael, some
HOT quested gear with a solstice earring as my only FT.  TBoots would be the only
thing I'd say a really poorly geared cleric might not have that was important to
soloing.  You have three options; root nuke run root nuke run, root DOT sit, and
melee stun heal melee stun heal.  All three options allow you to kill DB mobs,
although the last option really doesn't work in POP zones, where your lack of a slow
makes sucking up the damage impossible without excellent gear and AAs.  Either way,
I'll grant you that clerics solo poorly, because all three options cost substantial
mana, which means a bunch of down time between kills.  But its not because you can't
kill DB mobs.  You mention casters; casters are easier to kill (using method three)
than any other type of mob; stunning and bashing mean you interrupt almost everything
they can try and throw at you, and they tend to have lower HP totals, and waste part
of their melee time trying to cast spells, which you don't allow.

Neither Chardok nor Ragefire require a group/raid to drop what they are doing; they
aren't rare pop mobs.  Chardok mob pops two hours after being killed, Ragefire is
triggered and the trigger mob pops in 20 minutes.  For that matter, Ixi trigger can
be left up so you can do him multiple times in one EQ
night", or if he dies he's up the next night, which is also a matter of less than an
hour's wait.  Interestingly, you do mention the other alternative to planning a raid
on them; its quite possible to do them on a whim.  Scheduled raid target killed by
someone else before you got there?  Lets go do Overking.  Hey, there's 18 of us here
but the raid isn't for another 30 minutes?  I have my fragments, lets go kill
Ragefire.

That last will probably never happen, though, because any guild worth being in will
drop whatever they are doing and come kill Ragefire the day you have the four
fragments and the rest of the quest finished.  An epic cleric is too much of an
improvement over a non epic cleric to just blow it off for a few weeks... and its too
easy for a cleric who has his epic all but finished to find another guild if they
give you any lip.  Getting the other steps done is more problamatic, but if you can
get the force together for Overking and already have your 4 pearlescent shards, a
raid can be formed to kill Overking, Ixi, Ragefire, one after another, elapsed time
about 2 hours if they (/triggers) are all up, or worst case 5 hours if you happen in
just after each mob is killed.

Thats not to say cleric epic is easiest to get, I've never heard anyone say that.
Rogue, Beastlord, at a minimum, are easier; there are several looooooooong random
spawn camps involved in getting up to the parts you are complaining about.  Whats
easy about the cleric epic is that there are no rare spawns with rare drops (real
killer combo) so its just a matter of waiting for the mobs to pop in the early cases,
and rare drops off extremely plentiful (opposite of rare pop) mobs for the shard
part.  And the raid parts are easy because they all come once you are ready for epic
and can all be done in a day, always up or trigger mobs

Sadly, I do know what you mean about clerics not getting groups if everyone goes for
the pally/shaman plan... but just because its a bad thing for clerics doesn't mean it
isn't a viable plan.
