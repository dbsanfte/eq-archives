Not necessarily... While it is true that the number of trees slows down the
framerate, the game is looping through all visible objects and has to figure
out where to draw them.  During that process, it has to animate the swaying
trees, so in the game loop it has an extra animate step.

Simplified no animation:
loop
    compute static object 1 in world coords
    compute static object 2 in world coords
    ...
end loop

with animation:
loop
    compute animation static object 1 in local coords
    compute static object 1 in world coords
    compute animation static object 2 in local coords
    compute static object 2 in world coords
    ...
end loop

I can't imagine they aren't using any techniques to cull the objects behind
walls, offscreen, etc.  Has this been admitted by Verant?  This has been in
existance since raycasting was used in early games like DOOM and
Wolfenstein.
