Maybe Sony should end it all with a sputter.

All characters come down with incurable intestinal issues and when u log on,
you hear lots of gas-passing sounds, moaning and juicy, squishy sounds. All
players leave brown stain marks on the ground as they walk.  Their stamina
eventually tanks and they keel over in their own juice. Seems to be a
fitting end to the game considering they are pulling most all level of
customer support apparently. Hehe
