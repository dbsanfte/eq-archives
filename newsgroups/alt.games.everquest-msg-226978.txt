And what do you WANT them to do?  I carry cloudy potions, and often a 
Larrikan's mask, but they (and the tinkered invis item) use charges up, 
which means they get saved for need, NOT for saving the many many invis 
casters in the game 40 mana or so.  Self invising, while possible, isn't 
something I'd expect clerics to take care of when there are alternatives 
available, just as I wouldn't expect necromancers to take care of 
rezzing themselves when a cleric is handy.

I'm with you on most of this stuff, and am always shocked to find 
clerics who -don't- carry cloudy potions... but then I'm almost as 
shocked to find people with regular invis or camo who don't.  Invis 
fades, sometimes at the worst moments, and if you don't have "never 
fades" invis, then an insta click fix is a steal at 12pp.

But what a waste to burn em when its not necessary... do you drink them 
instead of casting camo on yourself?
