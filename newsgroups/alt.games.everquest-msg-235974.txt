Supposedly this was due to them saving *every* user after *every*
ticket.  Their system wasn't desgined for that much usage.

Not sure what the proper fix would be, but I'm sure they've strapped
another kludge onto an overburdened design.

I can see the appeal of EQ2, and being able to 'start fresh', but I
don't think that's necessarily the solution either.   While they're in
the process of re-writing a new client, does anyone know if they've
actually revised the default server software since beta, or is just an
endless mass of spaghetti code?  I'm leaning towards option 'B' there.
