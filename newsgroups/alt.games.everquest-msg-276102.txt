Well, I do, long before all the changes to make getting to level 10 
trivial.  I did the run from Halas to Freeport at level 9 to buy a spell 
in Oasis of Marr.  Made it to NK, got waylaid by a griffawn, and died 
somewhere trying to run away from it.  Had to run all the way from Halas 
again, naked and blind, it was an adventure just getting into 
Blackburrow.  Finally made it to NK, had to watch carefully for any of 
those red to me mobs, finally looted the corpse, made it to Freeport, got 
a bind, got my spell in Oasis, headed back to Halas after messing around 
in north ro for a while.  On my way back, I found out that Highland Lions 
outrun sow speed, died again.  Had to make the run from Freeport again, 
got my corpse, made it home to Halas.

Another time, at around the same level, it was night, I was in 
Blackburrow, and I fell into the water, started to get eaten by the fish 
and a gnoll or two.  I got very lucky and channeled a gate off before I 
died.  Had I died there at the bottom of the water, I would have had to 
find someone to get my corpse for me, there was no way I was going to be 
able to get it myself.

Sure, nowadays, with no CRs before level 10 or 11, and no xp loss untill 
10 or 11, it's much easire, not to mention the huge increase in xp you 
get.  But, there was a time when EQ1 was actually a challenge for newbs 
at low levels.
