What does it take to convince you besides 220 floors of steel and stone
coming down on 5 square city blocks, killing 6,000+ people and a the threat
of world war 3?

To not live in a world of endless worrying, thousands have sacrificed their
lives before you. Peace demands a sacrifice, ALWAYS. Freedom the same.
Sitting here and simply pretending the outside world won't come crashing
down on you is sad.

You do realize planned targets were Dallas, Boston, San Francisco, and many
other cities?

We should attack, and press this threat with the world, but don't think you
will be able to sit here and not feel any pain. On the contrary, you will
feel it deeply. Unlike any other war before, there will be serious events in
the USA. I hope I am wrong but the odds are in that favor sadly.
