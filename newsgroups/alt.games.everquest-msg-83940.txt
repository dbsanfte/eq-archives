    Below Chef - so Arm/Bar? The Chef wing is a dead end, with Chef at the
far end, so I'm having trouble visualizing where you were. And yes, that end
of the zone gets busy. Any good drops?

    My warrior has sub-100 DEX (thx Jarsath Trident), so I suspect that has
something to do with it. It may also be related to length of fight - fights
in the Dreadlands just don't last that long compared with Dragon Necropolis
fights, I'd wager. :-)

> You hate guilds.

    I think my first guild spoiled me, to be honest. Had a dash of roleplay
to it, GREAT people, nobody asked for help unless it was important, guild
events were planned so everyone could have fun (GRRAAAAAHHHH! FOR BETA
COMPANY!).... I miss Clan of the Underfoot.

    The solution is a radical one: stop raiding for the sake of raiding.
Gear yourself down to exploring one-and-two group dungeons for fun, or doing
specific mobs for specific drops for specific people. Many of the smaller
guilds are this way, and when it works it captures a lot of what I miss from
Clan of the Underfoot. It's not for everyone - I know one rogue in
particular who once told me he'd die inside if there was big mobs out there
he couldn't go after. You sound a lot like that rogue. :-) But it can work
for some.

    I KNEW that one would make you cringe. :-)

    That situation isn't about being smart, per se. It's about being fair,
in a different way than a points system is fair. A loot leader-type system
leads to better distribution for guild needs (usually) and a more flexible
way of recognizing individual effort on a raid. The drawbacks are favortism
and the chance of forgetting about the long-term effort some folks put in.
(I also like to say it rewards the fools who don't manage aggro and die a
lot, as sometimes "effort" is confused with "dies a lot", but I'm a crusty
dwarf.) Points systems reward long-term effort, and don't stress one
person's role over another (more egalitarian). Points systems can lead to
excessive rots, questionable point values for both participation and rewards
(any cleric that gets their epic with Vis Maior goes into a negative points
position for the raids required to do it), insanity in loot allocation, and
a real feeling of being second class amongst new members of the guild. No
loot system will be perfect.

    It's a cleric thing, it isn't specific to any one guild. I don't need
much to do my job, really - level 60, I still have 183 WIS and some pieces
of gear I bought at level 26 (pre-Kunark), and I'm cruising along. So I
don't make many demands on a guild, because frankly I don't need a whole
hell of a lot. But the guild will usually make many demands of me. They NEED
clerics to accomplish pretty much all raiding goals. They NEED clerics to
get back what can be an obscene amount of lost XP after a death. So they're
always asking me to help them, but I never get anything back because I never
ask for anything back because I don't NEED anything back. My buddy's cleric
is a real guild agitator - they've gone a whole three weeks <GASP> without
killing any mobs on his "dream gear" list, so he's lighting up their message
board to ask when the clerics will get more lewts. He has all the toys that
I always dreamed Delores would have - Weight of the Gods, Lodizal Shell
Shield, full Skyshrine, epic, the works. He plays "the game". I don't want
to have to be like that to be recognized for what I do.

    It's not just being marginalized. It's the radical change of role that
can happen. There's a nice thread on Graffe's right now about how the devs
at Fan Faire were all happy that the new wizard spell, Spellshield, gave
them a useful raid buff. The wizards are NOT pleased about this, because it
gives the raid leaders an excuse to make them buff bitches and take away the
role they want, dealers of death. Almost EVERYONE wants to be a dealer of
death, as that's what they were when levelling up (especially solo casters).
Becoming a "support class" when you weren't before is very disheartening.

    What, the attitude that I should be recognized just as much as everyone
else? :-) We're easy to forget about. Elsewhere in the newsgroup I advised
you where to find Lava Rocks. Please, take Tiru on a date there to get her
some.

    Anywhere where the mob can lose line-of-sight quickly, it's a bad idea.
Seb has a lot of turns, and a lot of SHM-SoW'ed frogs.

    Unless you're lucky or in crippling blow range (and it isn't often that
you're berserk AND trying to gain aggro), Charge is better. Charge refreshes
faster, twice as fast or more depending on level. Charge gives you more
hits, and hitting a mob generates more aggro than whiffing. As for
damage....

Charge: 14 seconds x 100% hit percentage x 1x damage modifier = 14 seconds
of normal hits.
Mighty Strike: 10 seconds x 60% hit percentage (long-term against blues) x
2x damage modifier (Crits) PLUS
                        4 seconds x 60% hit percentage x 1x damage modifier
= 14.4 seconds of normal hits.

    Even during the 10 seconds when Mighty Strike is churning out the
damage, you're only doing 20% more damage than Charge. You know better than
me whether hitting twice for 50 each or hitting once for 120 and missing the
second time generates more aggro, so I leave you with those numbers. (Over
the long term, Charge does more total damage, as you're Charging TWICE to
the one time you Mighty Strike.) Using this framework you can also get some
idea how much more damage you generate using Mighty Strike when Crippling.

    BAH! Live and learn. Or, in your case, die and learn. :-) I doubt anyone
on that raid would tell you that you did the wrong thing, and I bet most of
them would have done what you did. We're in a newsgroup, not an emergency
situation - we can sit around and do math to our heart's content.

    I want to take that back now, due to NEW INFORMATION! A palpable use was
found for it! From Graffe's, I give you.... Triton's Super-Secret Strategy
to Killing Venril Sathir!

Get to the kill area.
Have the warriors /duel down to berserk range.
Rune 'em up, pull Venril Sathir.
As the warriors engage, they chain-activate Mighty Strike (like a healing
chain). Because they're berserk, they'll also be staggering VS to the point
where he'll be perma-stunned. As long as the raid can kill him in the 20 or
30 seconds that Venril Sathir will be stunned by one of the warriors, and
that's with everyone pouring on the damage, he dies.

    So my bad. :-)

    Oddly, most of it was gifts from strangers or stuff bought off the
vendors with bone chip / chick talon / crushbone belt / crushbone pad money.
(Yes, you can find these things on vendors, even though turning them in for
the appropriate quest and selling the resulting item nets you MORE cash.)
And yes, these quests are how I was able to level so damn fast - every four
bone chips still gives me half a blue in level eight, so killing decaying
skeletons is STILL worth my time. Well... I also cheated a bit. I gave the
"a greedy beggar" NPC my first copper I made, which turned him into my pet.
Being a cleric with a pet from level one is quite a nice combo. :-)
