Yep, if i dont ask for help, i dont need it. And i dont help unless i 
can see a person need (10% health, running away), or see the person 
shouting.

Had plenty of "nice" people helping my level 52 butt with the nasty 
bixies in Kith when i was practicing begging on them. Had to run out 3 
times in 1 hour to get a new bixie because some moron killed my mob.
