Maybe for some very specific raids.  You're not killing any Velious boss 
mobs without a slower, and you're not landing slow without debuffs, and 
you're not going to keep ahead of the mobs damage output with just 
warriors, especially unhasted.  You're not going to do shit without 
resists against any AE casting mob, and you're not going to do ANYTHING 
against some of the fast-fight mobs (i.e. Queen in Chardok) without nukers 
nukers and more nukers.  
I can think of a couple fights where a warrior does nothing but sit on 
their ass for the boss mob (hint:  think CoM), and I can think of very, 
very few *raids* where you can do ANYTHING with just a cleric and a 
warrior.  No, killing ent mobs in the Hole doesn't count.
You name a class, and I'll tell you where they're required, where they're 
very useful, and where they just increase the lag.  OK, maybe not cleric, 
but I think I know of a couple of those spots too.
