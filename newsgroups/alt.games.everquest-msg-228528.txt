I think you just pointed to why I like the assassinate missions best.
Sometimes they're trivially easy and finished in 45 minutes (which
isn't always a bad thing) and some are truly memorable,
edge-of-your-seat dungeon crawls that come down to the last 5 minutes.
... and you never know ahead of time which it will be. It brings back
the things I've always enjoyed the most about EQ without having to
bother with the BS like a late night corpse run when you have to work
the next time. 

  Much as I hated the thought of a time limit before LDoN first came
out, I'll have to admit that I was wrong. It does add quite a bit to
the adventure, some of our wins (and my one real loss recently)
wouldn't be nearly as memorable without it. 

Rgds, Frank
