One would think that the original servers in EQ are going to be really far 
behind the new EQ2 servers in capacity, speed, etc., and they both are 
going to be delivering close to the same dataflow to the player.  So 
theoretically the EQ2 computers-in-the-servers, aside from keeping track of 
more content in the game, should probably be quite a bit more efficient, 
smaller(?), and fewer in number for the same in-game server name.
