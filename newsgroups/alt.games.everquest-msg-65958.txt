With this program (which I would only recommend over that FRAPS.COM program
which appears to be good enough, if you have DSL/Cable due to download size)
you can compare your systems FPS's with others that have run it on their
system.

On my third system (I play entirely too much EQ) which is a:

Celeron 400 @ 401 MHz
512 MB PC133 SDRAM
GeForce2 MX 32 SDR
ATA-66 5400 RPM HD
Windows 98 (IE 6.0)

I get a rating of 1123 in 3DMark2001.  Not near as high as my P3-866 system,
though, of all those comparable systems in their database, mine does score
the highest.  Woot. <grin>  My guess is that its due to my Mobo using the
Apollo 133a chipset and as I've been stressing lately, running all the
newest BIOS and Mobo drivers.
