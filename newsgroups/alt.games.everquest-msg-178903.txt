Future World
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

If you're out there all alone
And you don't know where to go to
Come and take a trip with me to Future World

And if you're running through your life
And you don't know what the sense is
Come and look how it could be, in Future World

We all live in happiness our life is full of joy
We say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness is always at our side
We love our life and we know we will stay

Chorus
Cause we all live in Future World
A world that's full of love
Our future live will be glorious
Come with me--Future World

You say you'd like to stay,
But this is not your time
Go back, find your own way to Future World

Life can be for living
Just try and never give in
Tell everyone the way of Future World

One day you'll live in happiness
With a heart that's full of joy
You'll say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness will be at your side
You'll say you love your life and you'll know why
Chorus

Scream it out

Chorus
