I disagree with that part, when I was levelling my druid, if my warrior
pulled a green that gave him no exp but was still blue to the druid he
certainly appeared to get, if not all the exp, a lot more than if the
Warrior had pulled a Blue to him and they shared the exp.
I'm sure, last time this came up, someone else noticed this.
