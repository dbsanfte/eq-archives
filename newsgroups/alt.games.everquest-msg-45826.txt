It's useless.
The pulses are too easily resisted for high end mobs.  Lower level
mobs, you're wasting mana by nuking.

In ToV, it's largely useless for druids to be nuking.  Even our weak
healing is more useful when keeping rogues, rangers, monks, etc..
alive to do the damage.

I can garantee you, 332 mana points is much better used in keeping a
rogue alive through the AoEs.  In the long run you'll do more damage.

The only time I can think of loading a nuke to really make it useful
is against dragons where DB is useless--and all of those are gimps
except for the super-Hoshkar in ToV North.

And you don't want to be using a target based pulse nuke on those
since you have to be in melee range for the nukes to stick.
