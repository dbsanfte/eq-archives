I wouldn't be opposed to a direct tell. If they see your situation and give it 
priority to the petitions they're currently reading then your problem must be 
somewhat significant. People who suggest to "get in line" or "wait your turn" 
don't understand that if your problem were not urgent or hadn't been waited on 
very long then the GM would likely tell you to file your own petition and they'd 
get to it. In this case the player has a reason to need to contact a GM and it's 
acceptable to do so.
