    You mean like all the lame, gimpy assed leet boys that avoid EQ because
of the vast amount of knowledge one needs to play it well? Oh, wait - that
just DRAWS THEM TO THE GAME. 'Leet folk don't want to be kings of online
checkers - they want to be the best at something that matters.

    Stop right there. WHAT landmarks? There are zones that have them, but
there's also a ton of zones which do NOT have anything that would function
as a landmark. Use my example from above, and tell me how you'd give
instructions to the ground spawn amulet piece for the Veeshan's Peak key in
Swamp of No Hope without using /loc. Or how you'd direct a cleric to your
corpse in the middle of the wide open plains sections of South Karana (got
jumped while travelling, boo!) There's too many wide-open zones in game with
no real landmarks for that to work very well. That's my point.

    Heh - truth be told, I know a lot of people who can't navigate by /loc.

    Except for all the people with some variation of the name "Legolas"
shouting to be given stuff, or PL'ed, or....
