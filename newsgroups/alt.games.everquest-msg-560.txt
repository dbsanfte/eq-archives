Consider the last paragraph in this recent post, in the thread "changing
account".......

"Well, let's put it like this... a lot of people are stupid, and would
say something intelligent to a GM like "Well, I never had any problems
with this account when my friend owned it...." or call them on the
phone and ask "How can I transfer this account from my friend to
myself so I'm paying the bill?"
Consider, we have Morse Code here who claims to have had his account
cancelled for recording a conversation (of course he fails to mention
that the content of that phone call was probably to convey a bomb
threat or 90 minutes of name calling)... that's the kind of brainpower
I'm talking about."

.......and read the definition again;

To utter a posting on Usenet designed to attract predictable responses or
flames.

Do you really think this lets bizbee off the hook?  What is he hoping for
here?
