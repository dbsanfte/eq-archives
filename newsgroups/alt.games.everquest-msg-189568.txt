Great story.  It's kind of heartening to see *true* newbies; I was afraid
that all level 10's were actually twinks.

It's great that you were patient, too.  I remember when I myself was a true
newbie, back when Velious came out.  Too many times I got into a group with
some folks, only to have them disband in disgust when it became clear I was
a true newbie.  (What, sit and med?  But I can't *see* anything then!)  Only
a few people took the time to explain things to me - most often I had to
learn by observation and good ol' trial and error.

So keep up the good work.  =)  The sooner they learn these lessons, the
better their entire EQ experience will be.  Hats off to ya.
