No. You're omitting the inflammatory part.

I'm amazed that a company in an unstable niche market like online
gaming should cock it's snoot at it's customers lead to believe that
they'll still be able to play EQ post SOL with windows 95, DX 8.0A, were
completely surprised, or are simply clueless. Marginalised or not,
they'll lose months, perhaps years worth of effort for having the
temerity to ask for their money back.

I think it's odd that people who staunchly believe in the power of
self-determinism and the right to make money would want to cheerfully
throw away theirs for no cogent reason, and mock those who begrudge the
penalty for protecting their own interests, or who simply can't afford
it.

They either don't realise how lucky they are, or rarely venture far from
the glowing box that is their sole companion.
