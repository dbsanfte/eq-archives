It sounds as if you were suffering from a guild comprised of people not
dedicated to their brethren. With the majority of the guild members more
concerned with themselves than the guild as a whole, what do you expect?

As I stated above, you obviously didn't have guild cohesion to begin
with. If you wanted to be flagged, yet didn't not have the guild
membership of the quality necessary to make that happen, then yes, you
*should* have found a guild more dedicated to each other. Yes, you paid
for the content, but not on your own terms. You have to be willing to do
what is necessary.

So those people who *did* get flagged couldn't go back through helping
others get flagged as well? If that is the way flagging works, I did not
understand it so, and I apologize. Otherwise, it's just a case of people
using the guild to get them flagged and not wanting to give something
back by helping others get flagged as well. 

Find a guild more interested in the advancement of its members. As much 
as you would like it to be so, your guild is not automatically the best 
option for getting flagged. From the sound of it, the support network 
just isn't there.
