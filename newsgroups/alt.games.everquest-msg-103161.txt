What class and level?

With an RBB I'd guess you are over 50.

Can't speak for prices on AB, afaik they are not far diff from BB and if
anything are cheaper but in the 10k mark you won't be getting the likes of
Argent Protector or Reaver. You can afford used and nearly new weapons ;ï¿½)

If you want to spend all of it I'd go for Bob's Axe (Doljonijiarnimorinar)
33/44 proc 140 pnt Ice Based DD (apparently at 1st level /boggle at Verant)
you should get this for around 8k or less.
Other than that you can get good ratio 2hders for a lot less. The Velium
Claidhmores, Battle Axes and War Lances (30/40 or better) are in the 2k
mark.

Can't see you getting the likes of Reavers or Argent Protectors for that
money tho'
