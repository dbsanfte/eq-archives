Snippy poo.

Actually they are right. There is no "camp" anyway, as far as SOE is
concerned. You lost the camp when you all died as far as many players
are concerned. No one there = no camping. They did not do the "nice"
thing, but no one is under any kind of rule that they have to do the
nice thing. Its weird that She said if you turned over the rights to
the camp she'd rez you, then proceeded to say they were taking the
camp anyway, then still did not rez you.. ahaha.

You could have petitioned about it though, then a GM would come and
say you all had to share the camp. Perhaps the Emerald Stars people
would then get bored and leave.

Even if I was taking the camp, I'd have still rezzed you. Isn't EQ
kind of too big now for this stuff to happen? Those people were pretty
petty, but you could probably also think of better things to do. One
thing to remember is turnabout is fair play, someday you'll have a
chance to also not be "nice" to someone in emerald stars.

Do like I did, I had someone take a camp from my level 34 druid in
butcherblock. Two and a half years later I had them ask me for an sow
in karnors, I was level 55 at the time. I said they had a hell of a
lot of nerve asking me for that when two and half years ago they stole
that camp from me in Butcher. I knew I'd get them someday, and I did.
My friend said, "Dang.. remind me never to do something you don't
like, your memory is too good."
