Yeah, I'd like that too, since I play a Pally...  But in all honesty,
"Meditating" and "Engaging in greuling physical combat, and enduring the
pain of having your flesh rended and your bones crushed" just don't jive.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
