Hehe.  I AM my ISP, I have been familiar with USENET for over 10 years, my
first exposure through the FidoNet USENET gateway.  You seem completely
oblivious to humor.  Since I have not broken any of the "USENET Rules"
(which are more like guidelines and get broken thousands of times every day)
your directing me to get said rules makes no sense at all.

Perhaps I can see if there is a support group named USENET FlameAholics
Anonymous.  If there is, I'll gladly forward the information to you.
