Highkeep and Splitpaw are for groups, Mons Seru is more for soloers but you
can occasionally get groups there

For the Bring Your Own Group (BYOG) spots:
Runnyeye, SolA, Crystal Caverns maybe

Might want to check the zones per level index on eqatlas as well for some
hints.

Steel warriors. Not sure of their current url, but you should be able to
find them via google.

Sorry, tradeskills are a pain but that's they way you make arrows. Group
with mages and let them summon arrows if you feel lazy. When you get higher
you can try to ask rangers as well if they have their Tolan's Bracer.
