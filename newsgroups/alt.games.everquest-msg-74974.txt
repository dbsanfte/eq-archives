simple: start your own group and master loot, split periodically

a well balanced group cutting through mobs shouldnt really care..... keep
track of the amounts and split accordingly. kinda neat when the split is
done and you get that 10-20-30pp (or whatever) split message, and you dont
have to spend time arguing over loot procedures.

as you level up it wont really matter and you'll just want the excess
polygons out of your view to ease the trouble on your video card as well as
targeting issues.
