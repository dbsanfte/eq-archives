Before I argue further, let me clear up some points... As far as I've
understood your beliefs so far, you think we should have prayer and other
religious traditions in public schools... you also believe religion should
be brought into other public and non-religious places.  Is this correct?
This is what I am arguing against, but I'd like to be sure I understand you
right so I don't waste my breath.
