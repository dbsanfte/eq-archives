I have to object to this generalization.   Yes, on mobs that run, having 
them unrooted and snared at the end of their life span can be quite 
helpful, saving you 20% of the beating, plus raising your MA's damage 
output by 10-15% (striking from behind, so the mob no longer dodges, 
parries, or ripostes).  But there are quite a few mobs that -don't- run 
(most undead for example)

Furthermore, if you are "porcupining" mobs, which is to say using a DS 
to do a large chunk of the damage, and relying on 
regeneration/healing/damage mitigation to take care of the damage the 
mob is doing, you may prefer that he not flee, even standing in place.

But the most interesting part of root and tank is that it utterly 
changes the aggro system for the mobs... and in a way that's greatly in 
a ranger's favor.   Rangers are an  odd class, typically they don't 
function as the MA in a group, but instead are one of the highest DPS 
classes.  Problem being, concentrating on DPS, they happen to turn into 
massive hate generators... so they end up having to do less than their 
best, in order to not steal aggro from the nominal MA.   Root, though, 
changes this; root the mob and instead of going after whoever is highest 
on the hate list, it will go for whoever is closest.    This means that 
the MA moves in to where he's stepping on the mob's toes, the ranger 
backs up to where he gets out of range messages on his melee and then 
takes half a step forward... and until root breaks he can go flat out 
using his fastest best and most proccing (assuming the proc isn't one 
that breaks root) weaponry and abilities and never get aggro.

Also, root allows you to simply back up to stop taking melee damage, say 
to wait for a heal, or to cast a spell you are having trouble 
channeling, heck, even to bind wounds on yourself if things are 
desperate... or for the truely desperate, to run away with a decent head 
start.

Root also allows chanters and high level clerics and wizards to step in 
close to get hit once so as to get their pets on the target, but thats a 
fringe benefit.

Problems with root: mob won't run, root breaks randomly, and worse, root 
breaks a -lot- if there's nuking or nuke procs happening.   Arrows, 
druid style DOTs (not the shaman kind with a DD component) and non 
damaging spells are fine, but if your group plan includes a lot of 
nuking then there's no use bothering with a root strategy for melee 
purposes.

ps On many occaisions while leveling up, I played MA with a ranger 
partner, using just this root and proximity plan.  Cleric get aggro off 
a ranger going flat out?  Without root, -you- try it sometime!
