With PoP you have decent transport.  The other thing you're missing
is rez.  But if you're on the ball you can likely survive most fubars
by gating the Shaman and FDing the SK.  So I'll agree with you, SK
plus Shaman looks pretty tough to beat.  Although I have to wonder
how two Necros would stack up.
