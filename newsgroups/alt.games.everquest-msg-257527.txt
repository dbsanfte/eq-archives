I wish they would level-restrict it like KEI, myself. I despise it when 
people don't feel they can function without it. By saying they don't feel 
they can function, I'm talking about when they do things such as run from 
the BB Wayfarers' camp to PoK to get a Temp, holding up the adventure, 
rather than just running without it.

Anyone who ever has the audacity to give me crap about not having it will 
get an earfull about how they need to learn to play their class so they 
don't feel it so necessary.

Power-gamers and gimps (not to say everyone who uses Temp falls into that 
category) are all well and good as long as they keep their chocolate out of 
my peanut butter, so to speak. ;)
