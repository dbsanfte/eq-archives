Given that you should have 250 to have a reasonable success rate for
any of the gifts (200 fishing for the fishing pole), I'd say you
should try to barter with grandmasters and not make them all yourself
unless you're 250 in smithing or tailoring or pottery and near 200 in
all other relevant skills.
For barterers - I like it if you have at least a modicum of knowledge
of tradeskills and read up on the quest. I saw a rogue last night
asking what to do with the 9 parts now that he'd bought them; at the
very least you should know what to do with the stuff.
The first two weeks after the earring was upgraded were kinda
annoying; the tradeskill channel was brimming over with people looking
for a 'quick fix' for their earrings.
