Just wondering if you did any training with either of your characters before
you went to try and find a fight. It's definitely worthwhile to do your
basic quest ( should be a note in your inventory ) so you at least get a
tunic and then train at your appropriate guild ( putting a few points in
your default weapon isn't such a bad idea )

This makes the first level a lot easier. If you try EverQuest again give it
a shot assuming you haven't already.
