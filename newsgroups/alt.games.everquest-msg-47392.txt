For your level (ie. 48):

Red = 3+ levels higher
Yellow: 1-2 levels higher
White (also Black): Same level
Blue: 1 level less (sometimes to 12 less)
Green: 13 or more less

Hoped this helped.  If anyone see's any errors with it, just correct me
please.  As I may be rusty on the system.  I pretty much go by creature now
seeing how long Ive been playing. <shrug>
