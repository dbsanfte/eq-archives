This is true for quite a few classes, after 100 they are mostly fluff, but
do help a little.

Have wondered why they didnt do this in a first place, many people can
completley trash normals, but struggle in hards, militis strength (bot
giant) mobs or slightly harder would be good for mediums.

A reasonable idea but I dont think it is workable.

Not sure if I like that idea, random generated dungeons have no
personallity, not that the current LDoN dungeons are busting with it...(I am
not a huge LDoN fan, have done abot 60 adv on my main since it came out,
probably 100ish total on all characters if that).

Maybe in some cases, but not all, take a look at the HoT quests for example,
the breastplate from grieg, and other examples.  The 'good' bazaar gear is
usually from raid mobs anyway (generally velious non no-drop stuffs).

We field around 3 groups of 65 on our biggest turn out raids (last night was
one group of six, and three groups of 5).

Some pop is doable, but for smaller guilds I think that gearing up through
boss fights, and smaller raid encounters is the only viable solution, either
that or alliance with another guild.
