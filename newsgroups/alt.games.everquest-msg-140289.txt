I hate to bust your bubble but that was I who posted as John Boy, no
one else. I made a sincere apology to John Boy stating I didn't
realize the name was already in use and I haven't used it since. You

terrorist as you like to call people for bashing them with untruths.

Hopefully this will shut you up for a while, Ghandi....

Doubtful, though...  You are simply too stoopid to know when you are
