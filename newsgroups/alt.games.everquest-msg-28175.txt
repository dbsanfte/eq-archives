Ain't that the truth. Finally reported and petitioned one today when he 
stood at the gates to Freeport and:

[Thu Aug 02 22:23:39 2001] Benaneb says, 'can i please have a couple 
platnum please'
[Thu Aug 02 22:23:41 2001] Benaneb says, 'can i please have a couple 
platnum please'
[Thu Aug 02 22:23:43 2001] Benaneb says, 'can i please have a couple 
platnum please'
[Thu Aug 02 22:23:45 2001] Benaneb says, 'can i please have a couple 
platnum please'
[Thu Aug 02 22:23:47 2001] Benaneb says, 'can i please have a couple 
platnum please'
[Thu Aug 02 22:23:49 2001] Benaneb says, 'can i please have a couple 
platnum please'
[Thu Aug 02 22:23:50 2001] Benaneb says, 'can i please have a couple 
platnum please'
[Thu Aug 02 22:23:53 2001] Benaneb says, 'can i please have a couple 
platnum please'
[Thu Aug 02 22:23:53 2001] You have added benaneb to your IGNORE list. 
(who's surprised? :) )

A guide said "guide so and so answering your petition" and I explained 
what was going on - but he never answered, so I have no clue whether it 
worked or not :/
