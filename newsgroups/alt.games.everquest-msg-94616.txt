I never ask for payment for ports, if someone asks me 'how much?' I tell 
them 'whatever its worth to you, free if you want'. That said, most people 
do donate, and I've got far nicer stuff from not asking for money than I 
would if I /auc'd ports at a set price. The occasional person will wander 
off without paying anything, but conversely the occasional bored level 60 
will give you that nice item they can't be bothered offloading in EC...
