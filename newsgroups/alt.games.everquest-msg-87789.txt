He'll run fine even with SoL, I do with a Voodoo 3 3000 16Meg card. Last
set of drivers from 3dfx were stable under 8.1, I did DL the recommended 
upgrade but had no real need to run it. I get the occasional graphic
freeze, but most people I know even with ninja PCs get that if they are
short on RAM so thats where I attribute the loss...Im on 128Meg there.
