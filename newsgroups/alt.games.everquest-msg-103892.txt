    Before I go off on my short rant here, keep in mind I've been playing EQ
since phase 4 beta and still play it to this day. Anyways, how is it that
Funcom can make a graphics engine that does outdoors so incredibly well. It
looks amazing and runs pretty damn well (it didn't at the beginning, but
it's A LOT better now). Yet, you zone into Dawnshroud Peaks or Twilight or
any other Luclin zone, and your framerate drops through the floor and
controls become sluggish. Not only that, but they don't look half as good as
the outdoor zones in Anarchy Online. I'm just wondering what the hell Funcom
does that Verant doesn't. Is it just sloppy coding or what (LOL I never
thought I'd put Funcom on the side of non-sloppy coding)?
