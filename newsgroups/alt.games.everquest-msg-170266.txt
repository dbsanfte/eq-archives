Probably.  There are several different arguments going on right now.  
One is who's responsible for setting up raids, and whose fault it is 
that there are none.  Another is exactly how tolerant one should be of 
newbs.  Then there are a couple people who pretty well snap at anything 
you say that they don't agree with.  Needless to say, it's tense :p  
Still, at least this time around, I've made enough friends that if the 
guild does crumble, I shouldn't have too much problems with grouping, 
and if the guild scatters to other guilds, I'll get to hear what those 
guilds are like ;p
