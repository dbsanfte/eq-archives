Just noticed this on eqdruids; haven't had a chance to check it in game,
but since I hadn't seen it mentioned on a.g.e I figured I'd post it:

---------(begin forwarded post)--------
A recent patch added new commands to allow others to drag your corpse, but
they didn't make it into the patch release notes.

/consent group - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be dragged by all
    current group members.
/consent raid - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be dragged by any
    members of your current raid (including people who join the raid later).
/consent guild - flags your current corpse(s) so they can be dragged by
    anyone in your guild.
/deny group, /deny raid, /deny guild - removes the corresponding flag

When you need to drag someone's corpse, rather than use a hotkey that has
"/corpse" in it, there is a "/corpsedrag" command that you can use to make
things easier for you.. If you target the corpse you need to drag and type
"/corpsedrag", it acts as an autofollow for the corpse! The corpse will
follow you wherever you need to go!

When you get to where you wanna drag it to, just use the "/corpsedrop"
command to release it :)

Now, I'm not sure if you could attach multiple corpses to you or not, as
I've only had to drag 1 corpse since I found this command. But it could be
handy if you could drag more than one corpse at a time.
