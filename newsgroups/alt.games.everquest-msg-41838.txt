Unless something happens up past the mid 50s, aren't wizards
limited to an AOE snare?  AOE in tight quarters, particularly
indoors, is always a risk, and the fact that wizards are constantly
snaring themselves with this makes things even worse.  I'd rate
this at no more than a 6.. unless, as I say, there is a single target
snare at higher levels I'm not familiar with.

I think lack of SOW makes it impossible to rate this at a ten.  Sure,
they can port better than druids... but thats no more than half the
travel battle, unless your target for some reason always hangs out
at a wizard spire.

I wouldn't give druids a ten either, since they lack TL, but would
certainly put them at 9 and wizards at 8.

Why one?  With a choice of invis or IVU, a CR can be made in
quite a wide variety of situations.  Sure, places with a mix of
live and dead are impenetrable, as are places with see invis
mobs...but one?  You give em a 5 for hostile for just this combo!

Why is this?  The point of nuke pullling is that the range gives you
the running room to get back to the group safely.  Further, snare
pulling lets you walk away from the mob and still beat it to the
plate.  On the other hand, your definition of pulling involved
getting a single out of a group, and here wizards rank pretty low
indeed.  Good thing they usually want all four mobs they pull.

There are many places I won't go without either a wizard or druid...
need one or the other flavor of porter since thats going to be the
only realistic way of getting the tanks out, and I'm not going in
without a tank.

> MAGICIAN:
> Damage Absorb: 3...this is an int caster after all

But their pets are some of the best damage absorbtion engines in
the game...and they regen faster than "real" tanks.  Where possible,
let the pets soak up a good portion of the damage... if things go sour,
let em die, noone loses exp over that.

Buyable material component is a plus, not a minus.  Expecially at level
60, would you rather drop a couple pp into a backpack of stacks of
rocks, or spend time in Kurns killing unbelievably green mobs
for their chips?  I suppose if you need a pet during CR the fact that
in some areas you can get chips easily without a bank run counts for
something...

Have invis, can CR in places without dead and see invis mobs pretty
well.  Can also pull you and the cleric out of a one way spot after you
get a res with COTH.

Pets are great for pulling outdoors... unless they are enchanter pets.
Park the pet behind the group, pull from the front, and when you arrive
(if you parked at the right spot) your pet will meet the mob precisely
in the kill zone, every time without fail.  Pets screw up a lot of things,
but pulling sure as heck isn't one of em (assuming you have the room
to swing this, of course)

>
>
> NECROMANCER:
> Damage Absorb: 3...robe, robe, robe

Here I'm talking from a low level perspective, but slapping a
lifedraw on the mob lets me sponge pretty well, as while I'm
losing HP to the fight I'm busy sucking it down off the mob
in a DOT that works as a self HOT.  If this line continues
to the higher levels I'd think you'd have to give em at least
a 4.  Still lousy AC and actual HP totals, of course, so no higher.

> Damage Avoid: 8, like the magician, but they also have Fear

9... they also have FD.  Is there a better damage avoid than FD?
Unfortunately, it fails if you have DOTed the mobs, or I'd pump for
10.  Oh, don't forget shadowstep, either.  Maybe I -would- say 10.

>
> Travel: 2

I'd bump this up for Dead Mans' Float, levitate and EB that lasts
a good long time, quite a few places where this will really help
you travel.  Oasis barge (or BB barge or OT boat or FV boat)
to TD, DMF and a SOW potion/Jboot click and dash to the
firepots in under ten minutes, port to any city in the old world but
Qeynos... if you keep yourself bound in Oasis, you are always a
short hop from half of Norath.  Heck, go to NRo, raft to Iceclad
and run levitated to the bridge in half the time that boat trip takes.

> Hostile Territory Travel: 6, invis, IVU, and feign death

DMF will also let you get up out of aggro range of a lot of mobs in certain
zones.

At level 60, I'd hardly call 175pp a shot "expensive as hell".  Drop in the
bucket, really.

And Fears, and the pet sacrificing itself holding back the mobs.

>

Again, only an inexperienced pulling pet handler (other than an
enchanter with an animation up) will experience trouble with
a pet interfering with a pull.  Pets have a relatively short aggro range,
so its just a question of putting them where they can't hear you
being hit till you are where you would like them to start moving.

>
> CLERIC:

Cruddy HP?  Clerics?  OK, compared to a warrior, paladin, or shadowknight,
perhaps... but assuming that we are considering all classes at self buffed
state only, cleric HP certainly compete quite admirably.  Can also take
some mighty big harm touch slaps by running DA... but not, to my sorrow,
a Death touch.  Fright says BERGH

> Taunt: 6, heals can be used to taunt, and stuns make for good taunts

I'd say lower than this, stuns make lousy taunts, and unless you've
purposefully loaded high taunt heals, post 44 cleric heals don't taunt
much at all.  I suppose it -would- be possible to slap in SHeal
in order to use it as a taunting engine, but I've yet to see anyone
do so on purpose, the spell slots are too valuable for something
like this.

> Damage Avoid: 4, stun and root

And the Divine Series.  Take no damage for 18 seconds, and now
its a detaunt too.

> Root: 6

Who is better at rooting than a cleric?  You rated necro root at
a 6 also, so you aren't thinking that a DOT root is superior.

>
> Snare: 1, innoruuk worshipping clerics can get the snare necklace
> Travel: 2

I'd give a cleric a 4 here...since by the time you hit 60 every porter in
the world has said "any time you need a port just call me" about 50 times.
Oh, and ever since revive, I've been better able to get any dead person
from anywhere in Norrath (-anywhere-) to right there where they died.
If you are going to count COTH as travel I don't think you can not count
Revive/Res.  Try this:  Duel, person dies, hits the bank quick, revive...
port and cross zone COTH all at once.  Five minute limit on what you
do at your bind point, though.

> Melee Damage: 3

Hehe, up to level 44 I outdamaged most paladins my level.  Too
bad melee skills capped there... for a 60 I would have to agree.
it can't be good.

> Mob Debuffing: 5, stun only

And Fear.  Under the right circumstances the best debuff in the game.

> Crowd Control: 3, root only

And Fear.  And Atone.  Root only?  Don't be silly.

> Downtime Reduction: 0...meditating for more heals doesn't count

Heals sure do though.  Try running two warriors versus a warrior and
a cleric, and tell me which group has less down time.  Very mana
efficient heals means less down time.  Too, I have Thurgadin quest
legs, clickable group 100 HP each heal... if you are going to count
the innorurk symbol as a snare for the class, and the annoying DW helm
as a downtime reducer, you'll have to give me this one... I've ended
many a good strong fight with everyone at full health and myself at
full HP due to these little critters.

> Tracking: 0

Sense undead and Sense Summoned.. you'll have to give me a
one at least, perhaps a two, with necros at one for having only
one of the two.

Revive/Res, though, will get you thru a lot of hostile territory real quick.

Or group heal, or a favorite, Wave of Fear (there's your weak spot,

I love to pull!  Have to say, though, that when you say this includes
the ability to get just one from a full spawn, well, I have trouble.  I
can pull one from a pair, by rooting or (uh oh there it is again) fearing
the other, but the lull line is a joke, so I'm getting at best all but one.

Enchanter, Cleric, Warrior, Porter, and two others... thats classic group
construction.

I can't speak to 60, but certainly in the 45 to 52 range I've been happily
soloing

All it does is save you some mana ressing, by 60 you can do the same res
yourself anyway.  If you get it at level 46 its certainly useful... but we
aren't talking level 46 here.  If this is the most useful epic in the game,
that makes the rest of them small cheese indeed.

At least it can be buffed up and kept around.  Also can charm animals

Wolf form (even discounting the running speed factor, which
seems a crazy thing to discount) will make you not KOS in many
otherwise hostile areas.

Although I agree, quite useful, my experience is that this is
an underrated class at high levels... main reason they get
in groups is desire for a porter, and its flip a coin between
druid and wizard for that, particularly since the groups
eager for a porter are often indoors groups.

>
> WARRIOR:
> Damage Absorb: 10...nobody comes close

I don't agree here, I wish it -was- true, but a
warrior has to work -hard- to keep the love, and
everyone else in his group has to pay some attention
to aggro management not to steal it from him.
All he's got is his taunt skill, his quad hits, and
weapon procs.

>

So many people are better taunters that swapping in a slow two
hander and not hitting the taunt key will enable a warrior to maintain
his damage production without getting the taunt... if thats what
the plan calls for for some reason.

I don't see that as crowd control, really, you are still accepting full
damage output from the mob.  Crowd control is reducing the fight
to one at a time.

>

> Damage Absorb: 8, less hp than warriors, but their AC and superior
> defensive skills compensate

Plus the fact that they can FD means that that "just in time" heal isn't
going to be hitting a dead body if the timing is a little off.  For
non-clerics,
a monk is often a more practical main tank, since the same mob
will be doing less raw damage, so less mana needs to be used in healing
(for lower level clerics, this is also a factor...)

> Taunt: 9, monks often taunt a lot more than they want to

Without a taunt key, getting aggro when you want it is often difficult
for a monk.  True they do get it when they don't want it... but when
they -do-, thats often impossible.

Better at bandaging than other classes, and have mend.  Have to
at least give them a two.

>
> Buffing: 0
> Mob Debuffing: 0
> Crowd Control: 5, monks can occupy mobs pretty well

Again, I disagree that soloing a mob is a legitimate way
to "control" it... but a monk can pull one off a ways and
then FD, let it move towards the party then stand and
get aggro again... also, a monk can often deliver only
solo mobs via FD pulling, which is an ultimate form
of crowd control: Making the mob not show up at all!

>
> Downtime Reduction: 4, mend is nice, but self-only

Aye, but again, they are great at bandaging... if they aren't off
pulling.  Particularly amusing is bandaging a necro healer
or necro mana pump.

Not so.  Cleric camps, monk FD's, and watches till the coast is
clear, even pulls mobs away and FDs em to clear the area...
when the shyte -really- hits the fan you hope like heck that
the monk lives.  Also, monk can grab all the aggro while the
rest of the party runs for it, and then FD before he dies once
everyone is clear.

I may have lost something somewhere, who are you rating

Again, no taunt button means taunting to get something

Only in a group... if there's no other target, evade doesn't

Sneak/Hide is so slow that I don't think I'd give this a 9...

Why so high?  When it hits the fan, a rogue can't help himself, much
less anyone else.

I don't think I've seen anyone in the game with a higher taunt factor than
a good dex ranger.  If they hit the taunt button, dual weild dual attack
with proccing weapons and spells generating procs all at once, its difficult
for anyone to get the mob off of them... trick is not to taunt, and to use
Jolt liberally, since tanking isn't a job they do well.

Flash of Light.  Learn it, live it, love it.  Quick cast, back
up and mob loses you long enough for a root or for you
to start running, or for someone else to successfully taunt
or mez it... same with Stun.  Basic simple extremely low
level (and cheap) spells that are a mainstay.

> Downtime Reduction: 5, make good downtime healers, especially with the
> deepwater helm

The DW helm is only practical in a group without a decent cleric, since its
use requires that you throw away hundreds of hp from your total; it isn't
actually a heal, it casts a low level cleric HP buff that serves as a heal
of sorts... but if you have a higher level buff in the same line, you are
immune to the "heal" of the buff.  By level 60, even a paladin soloing is
looking at throwing away a substantial stack of buff hp in order to get
the fairly minimal healing the helm provides.
