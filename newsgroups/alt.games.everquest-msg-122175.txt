I have the same problem on Win 2k and have had ever since I started playing EQ
about a year ago.

Bottom line is that they don't seem to have any intention to fix it.  Learn to live without
the music :)    Also, recently, there's been a reemergence of a sound bug I thought they
had fixed a while ago.  When I'm inside a building, the sound often goes into a whining
feedback mode.  I have to type /reverb off to fix it.  And everytime I zone, /reverb gets
turned on again.

So, for the most part, sound is a big problem with SB live 5.1, and Win 2k, and perhaps
WinXP too.  Sigh.   Maybe I'll buy a different sound card.
