The high level people who favor it are statistically irrelevant. Of the over
100 people in my guild none favor it . We are all high level . Allkhazams
lists respondents as 50% against any attempt at tcc , 35% think it is just
handled badly and 15% like it . 3 times as many people dislike it as like it
and thats over all level ranges .

Try to keep in mind the following as well

15% of the population is pascifist and would just ignore the recent bombings
if they could.
15% of the population is decidely communist.
15% of the population prefer anarchy to goverment .

There is always a significant fringe group that thinks that almost anything
would be a good idea . They tend to be noisy as well. Listen to them at your
absolute peril because you are going to annoy the majority and we have ways
of fixing you good :p
