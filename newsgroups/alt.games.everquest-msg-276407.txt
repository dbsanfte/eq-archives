I quit EQ2 because I didn't feel like I could solo effectively.  Since
then, they have made a bunch of changes, but nothing that has really
jumped out at me as worth resubscribing.  I like the Mentoring, but
mostly would wish it was implemented in WoW.

Personally, in WoW I have 7 characters, so when my main (currenlty 50)
runs out of things to do, I have 6 others to fall back on.  I assume
that if you really are a casual player, you only have one character at
high levels, so...make another one!  Have fun with twinking...or
perhaps try the other side!  I honestly couldn't care less about the
lack of things to do at high levels, when I still have fun at low
levels with new characters.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
