That's great, but the guy I answered was asking about "Root", which is the
name of a specific spell given to Wizards, Clerics, Paladins, Shaman, and
maybe some other classes.  I thought about including a disclaimer in my
post to head off these sort of "corrections", but I was feeling lazy and
hoped people would catch on to the fact that the class in question was
"Wizard" and the spell in question was "Root", not "Druid/Ranger" and their
different line of spells.
