    Heh, I had to check the dates on these posts. ;-) Gang, Velk's was
changed more than a few patches ago. Poison is gone from the spiders, and
they now range in level from 45 to 49. In addition some named spiders have
been added up top with some very nice drops. Note that the damage output of
the spiders has NOT changed - this is one of the easiest XP-to-60 spots in
the game now.
