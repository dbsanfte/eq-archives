It is VERY worth it. Damage shields and aggro are two reasons... the third 
for me has always been:

What happens if an uber 2hb drops in front of me some day... I want to USE 
it. I have neglected 1hb (out of weight considerations- low level ones are 
HEAVY) until now (21) and I regret it sorely. My current compliment is a 
Khaliz Khatar (nice damage and delay, plus some stat bonuses, h2h weapon, 
1.3 stone), Essence of Dol (awesome 1hb, .1 stone), and a Bamboo Bo Stick 
(2hb, 1 stone). Yes, dual wielding does more damage, but the 2hb skill does 
not take too long to max every level, and after that I throw it back in 
inventory.
