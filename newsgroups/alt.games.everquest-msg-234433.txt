For most of my career as a Shaman, a Slow would either land, or get
resisted. You'd either see

"a Valiant Guard yawns"

or you wouldn't and you'd get a resist message.

Occassionally I'll also see a message to the effect that this mob is "immune
to changes in its attack speed" (e.g., the wind mini-boss in BoT).

Nowadays, with High-difficulty LDoN or other BoT mini bosses like Oreen, for
example, I'm getting a different couple of messages.

"Your spell was mostly successful"
"a Valiant Guard yawns"

or this one

"Your spell was partially successful"
"a Valiant Guard yawns"

This, I take it, is the "mitigated slow" I've heard about, yes? The mob is
slowed, but has mitigated your slow attempt to some extenst, resulting in
only a "partial" (or "mostly") reduction. Or does slow mitigation refer to
some other effect that I've yet to see?

Second question: what percentage is "partial" and what percentage is
"mostly"? I suspect that they both reflect some fixed percentage of the base
speed, or perhaps some percentage of the base slow. In other words, if my
Turgurs slow reduces attack speed by 75%, and a "Mostly" is defined as say
60%, does that mean the net effect is the mob's attack speed is slowed to
60% of its original base speed, or does it mean that my slow effect nets out
to a reduction of 60% of the potential 75% reduction?

I've searched the Shaman boards and asked in game and, surprisingly, no one
has been able to answer my question yet.

Thanks,
