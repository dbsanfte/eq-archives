Mine said that since I only had 128Mb I should buy more, especially since I
had plenty of money in the bank and several stocks that were about to top
out. And that I should ask my wife first, after she got back from the
neighbor's house. I especially liked it when they asked how my parents were
doing and whether my mothers foot operation turned out OK. Its amazing the
stuff they find lying about the computer =).
