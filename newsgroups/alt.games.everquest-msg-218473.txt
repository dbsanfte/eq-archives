Other places are fungus grave (mushrooms), maidens eye (toilers near the
lake) which are blue up to 60, but go light blue at 65. We usually aoe in
akheva ruins when we are clearing to the IV. Rocks cant be mezzed but they
do stun. Just dont aoe past the traps, lot of unstunabbles in deep.

I reckon grimling forest and acrylia caverns would work well too (the
grimlings) but I havnt done it here yet. Rockhoppers work well too.

Hmm not sure about 50 or 60. I remember my druids pbaoe not hitting all mobs
in range when i was killing those spider swarms in WK, so even these have a
limit, tho its a lot bigger than 4.

Its good outdoors with a druid, cos you have time to aoe tash them when they
are snared (aoe snare of course).
