As a level 25 Wiz, L23 Mag & L23 druid - I like playing the druid the
best.

My current bit of fun has been doing drive-by SoWs.  I see you, target
you, Sow & run.

You won't believe how many times people have done Clarity & run on me
in response, or mega Cleric buffs.

I get much more out of the game by not trying to haggle over a few
plat, and just give a little bit here and there.
