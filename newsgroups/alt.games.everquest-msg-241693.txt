I really liek what I've seen in WoW with regards to the griffon rides.
Start with a couple open.  Journey on foot to the next town and speak
to the griffon master to 'unlock' that town and add to your list.

Forces players to make the journey at least once, and then seriously
reduce the tedium afterwords.  The travel still isn't instant, but
it's an elegant solution.
