The Goblin's in DC are a much higher level than the AG's in BB!!
I can make 200pp off one AG camp in BB in an hour.

How many do you typically pick up per hour?  I played for about 1.5 hours
last night, in BB.  In that time, I picked up 2 vials Goblin blood, 2 heads,
a greenblood medallion, and one pristine carapace.  The vials, heads and
medallion are all worth 3p, 7g and change.  The carapace is worth 7g and
change, though I could probably sell it for more to a player.
Unfortunately, I was hunting spider silks.  Killed at least a dozen spiders,
but only one dropped a pair of silks, so I still need two more to make a
stack.  With other money from killing goblins, I netted about 22p in the 1.5
hours.  That's not even doing one of the AG camps.  I've not done one of
those, but the last time I ran into an Aqua Goblin, I got my butt handed to
me on a platter (In Dagnor's Cauldron, long story), so I don't know if my
level 13 Wizard is ready for that.

Cheers,
Eric
