We took our (now) level 53 ranger and wiz to Grimling Forest last night.  One
grimling camp was green, the other light blue.  I could single pull those
without pulling the whole village, pretty dull stuff, tho the runes they
dropped averaged 5 PP each.  There were 2 other people in the zone, working on
a beastlord quest if I recall correctly.
Oh, and we invised and ran down to acrylia caverns.  At the zone line on the
Grimling side everything was light blue / dark blue.  2 sonic wolves guard the
tunnel.  Kept getting adds and had to zone.  Gave up.  There was a level 60 on
the acrylia side at zone line playing so we didn't even attempt to play there.
I'm going to take my 44 druid out there later and see how it is for her....
