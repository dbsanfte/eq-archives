1)Welcome to the Wonderful World of Necromancy!

2) You *always* get a warning 5 seconds before Gather Shadows wears off on
its own. That is usually plenty of time to get out of aggro range of
whatever might be near and recast. But sometimes it isn't. Such is the
(un)life of the Deathmage....

3) It is both easier and a bit safer to bolt through Rivervale under cover
of Invis than it is to bolt through HHP. If you wish, roll a halfling and
take a few practice runs from Kithicor to the Thicket first.

4)Bear in mind that you can also get to NK via the southern route. More
running and more time consuming, sure; but it's safer for a Necro, and it's
generally easier to get SOW than a port. You may find it a wiser choice to
take the more time-consuming route than to risk getting nailed in Rivervale
or HHP, and then have to do a CR there too.

5)Keep Harmshield and FD memorized for the length of your journey. If you're
not on a PvP server, you should always have FD ready anyway. But for
Innoruuk's sake, don't ever use it in Rivervale.

You'll find, as you continue to gain levels, that GS will wear off
prematurely far less often.
