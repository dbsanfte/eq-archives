Thanks for that, top poster. We like to hear you tossing on about your 
broadband while you quote the entire message without adding anything 
useful and making incorrect statements to boot.

DSL *is* considered broadband idiot.

If you have a decent hardware modem with decent phone line and decent 
connection to your ISP you will not notice much difference between that 
and a broadband connection. Everquest does not rely on latency as much 
as action games such as Quake do, nor does it need as much bandwidth.
