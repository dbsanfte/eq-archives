LoY gives a new race (Trolls got thrown out of Grobb by the Frogloks). It
also gives a bunch of new zones for 35-55 (at least thats the levels from
my guild you commonly see floating in the new zones). They are accessed
via Stonebrunt mountains.
Other extras are a guild control tool, extra bank space and a cartogrpahy
tool. Also a LFG tool and a group looking for players tool as well.

PoP includes a series of high level zones for seriously high end gaming,
very potent stuff. Its other major additon for everyone else is a series
of pedestal objects near and in city zones that connect to the Plane of
Knowledge. As well as serving as the gateway to the new planes zones it
also acts as a instaporting rapid transit service, which you have
found...the big library in the middle of the zone holds a bunchs of new
spells for casting classes and the portals are scattered.

You see the various portal stones to zones - one of them goes to the Plane
of Tranquility.....thats the way onwards. As to level range it goes on up
to lvl 65 in there and can be horrible....our guild was raiding a bit
in PoJ and was doing it with groups ranging from 58 down to 48 or so....

Thats one of the early planes.

Go to www.eq-toolbox.com download maps there rather than make your own.
Its a lot easier
