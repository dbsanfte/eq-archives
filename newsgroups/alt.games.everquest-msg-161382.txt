Long the among the worst spells in a clerics' lineup, the Lull
line is rumored to have substantially improved, to the point of
potential usefulness.

I've tested it a couple times, and found that indeed, it seems to
be resisted less often (formerly at least 75% resists) and
sometimes does not aggro its target (and the other mobs you were
trying to split) when it is resisted.

However, frequently it still does aggro.

I've got lots of other new toys to play with, and people
generally don't expect a cleric to do the splitting, so I shelved
the line again as something interesting to look into in the
future.

Well thats too much detail; what I meant to bring up is something
I just saw over on Castersrealm;

------------------------------------------------------------------

We don't usually get too far into specifics in favor of people
discovering the
                       usefulness themselves.

                       Unfortunately, with an ability as subtle
as this one, Charisma's impact is hard
                       to discover, and would likely continue on
into the annals of EQ history as
                       "useless."

                       That said -- On the Lull/Harmony series,
which has recently been rewritten,
                       there are two checks, as I imagine most
everyone knows already.

                        Is the effect resisted?

                       If the effect is resisted, will the NPC
get angry and tell its friends that it's
                       time for a BardSnack(tm), or will it
ignore what just happened?

                       Charisma is the sole determinant in the
second check. It doesn't affect the
                       first.

                       As for the in-game justification: If it
likes you enough, it might find itself
                       compelled to forgive you for trying to
pull a fast one on it.

                       Hope that helps.

                       Best,

A later note confirms that this is for clerics and enchanters as
well as bards.

Since my "fighting" charisma is under 80, its little wonder I
mostly got aggro on resist; now perhaps I'll put epic and opal
encrusted stien in hand, and then get a shaman cha buff, and see
if I can get this trick working as intended
