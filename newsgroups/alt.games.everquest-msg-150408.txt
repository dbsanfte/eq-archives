I'd LOVE to have heard you come 'round these parts about a year and a
half ago and to have said that.

That said, Manaburn is an almost unbalancing skill.  I say almost
because I haven't heard (which doesn't mean one doesn't exists) of any
encounter that REQUIRES manaburn wizards.  They help take most things
down, but aren't necessary.
