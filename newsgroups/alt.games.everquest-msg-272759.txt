Aye, but the example presented involved the mobs heading straight for the 
healer without any heals being cast. Basically, the scout got enough aggro 
to pull, yet the mob ran past him to the healer who hadn't done a thing 
yet.

From what others are saying, however, it seems that the AI may have 
actually been designed to target healers first in some cases. Maybe healers 
automatically get a certain level of aggro right off the bat.

Interesting. That would certainly give you a reason *not* to pull with low 
aggro spells/abilities.
