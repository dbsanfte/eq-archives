The last thing the rogue class is more reason for everybody to start up
twinks.

I started a thread on this on our server board yesterday.  A chance to quest
something class- or religion- based.  For example, an younger, more naive
rogue I know once helped a total stranger on a Lucan raid.  She didn't
realize that the Coalition (rogue's guild) was strongly tied in with it and
is now KoS to her own trainer.  While she doesn't give a hoot about doing
Militia quests in hopes of raising some Coalition factions, she would very
much like a way to grovel directly before her trainer and restore herself in
Nestral's eyes.   Something that would have her use her roguely skills (a la
Epic note picks) or skulking into a dungeon to retrieve a groundspawn.
Maybe even see a tiny change in the Trivial Loot Codes so that mobs WON'T
drop their loot UNLESS killed in a specific manner (ie must be poisoned with
a specific (read: money sink) poison).

> Give options for raising far more factions.

Sure, see above.

> Create craft-based uses for many more of the random drops.

Of, if it's basically junk loot on higher level mobs just remove them from
the loot tables.
