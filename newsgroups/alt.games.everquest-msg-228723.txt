Hmmm - I'm lost which thread this is.  I'll assume I simply
wasn't clear.

When I say high end I mean elemental groups and raids (above
me) and that info is from parses on the Tower.  They have many
that show wizards doing the same *total* damage over a time
period.  At my level I have Tier 3 equipped Rangers, Rogues and
BL's beating me (according to the parses our warrior was running).
I'd wager I can beat any comparably equipped wizard in sustained
DPS without effort.

That said, There is something simply not right about a wizard only being
able to drop 2 1500pt nukes a mob and a mage dropping 2 of our
biggest mana hogs per.  I only use FoT against raid level mobs
(usually so I can get oor of ae's).
