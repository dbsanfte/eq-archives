I heard that this was giving people 50% of their mana pool back,
instead of 50 mana back, something along those lines.  More than
intended, indeed!

Gah!  I only know of one quest that improves faction with these
guys, and it looked so tedious and ineffective that I never did
it.  Killing RyGorr should increase faction with them!  And there
really should be a quest in there that takes the rygorr scalps.

At any rate, my bard uses faction song to trade with these guys, as
its simpler to go to all the vendors without having to bother with
sneak, having his faction with them hurt would suck for that... and
going KOS to them would suck even more!
