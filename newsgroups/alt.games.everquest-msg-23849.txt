Fear doesn't take 40+ people unless you're killing the golems.  Our last fear
raid was done with 18 people.  0 deaths on the break, no evac'ing.  Not all
super high levels either, only a few 55 or over.  Other guilds have done it
with 12.

Sang is wrong though.   Fear isn't an experience camp.   It's an item farm.

Fear is much more of an exception than the rule.  With Fear, you can evac to
South Ro and have the survivors back at the portal and ready to go back to the
exact same location within 10 minutes.  On any other raid, evac would cause
more problems than a wipeout... so you're much better off trying to get a
cleric camped for rezes.

Rezing people can be done relatively quickly, compared to getting your entire
party back together in a *very* hard to reach location, while at half
strength, since half of it's forces are naked wherever they died.  It takes at
most a half hour or so to get everyone rezed, rebuffed and fighting again.
(Much less than that if you have a noodle equipped cleric).   It could take
hours to for the survivors to fight back to the location from outside alone.
