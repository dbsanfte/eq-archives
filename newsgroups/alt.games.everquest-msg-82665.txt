You are actually buying the unique reg code on the software. You could
install to all the computers from the same cd but if you have 4 people
who are going to play at the same time you will need 4 seperate boxes
with the 4 seperate reg codes.

You can only create the 6 or whatever characters PER reg coded account
PER server, you can have as many "Accounts" which you play on that
computer as possible since the only "account" is determined by your
login and password, you could play 10,000,000 accounts on the same
computer if you had 10,000,000 purchased everquests so you had
10,000,000 passwords and logins. You could have 4 reg coded accounts
on 4 different computers or 4 on the same computer. Each of the 4 is a
SEPERATE retail purchase, since the reg code on the cd = your account.
If you want your family to have original EQ and shadows of luclin, you
must buy FOUR original EQ and FOUR shadows of luclin for FOUR
accounts. If you know that only TWO people are going to be logged in
game EVER at the same time, you only need TWO original EQ and TWO
shadows of Luclin. You could then copy the software over to all four
computers since it is your LOGIN and PASSWORD which you get with the
REGCODE which determines which account it is that is logged in.

EACH expansion works the same way as original EQ, you need to use the
REGCODE which comes with it (unique, per your accout) on your ALREADY
EXISTING account (which you already used the regcode from original EQ
(or kunark) for) to upgrade your account to also include that
expansion.

You could have all the expansions installed on all the computers, and
if a person with an account with all expansions enabled got on one
they could go to all the places while if another person with only EQ
and kunark enabled got on one they could only go to EQ and kunark on
that account (though the other products are still installed.)

No, each expansion only needs itself and everquest while Kunark comes
with everquest so only needs itself. Scars and shadows both need
either original EQ or Kunark (since it comes with original EQ)

None of the EQ products puts any unique registry or account info on
any computer (except for uninstall info with Luclin). In fact, you
don't even have to install it to every computer, you could install all
the product to one computer then just copy your EQ dir over to the
rest of them and play the same way.
