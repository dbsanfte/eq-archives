*furrow brow* WTF is going on Ben?  I spoke with you in game once cross
channel and you were a nice, mellow person to talk to.  (At least, I
*think* it was you...you mentioned how you used to be in Altera Vita and
we talked about other completely random BS.) Why the sudden insulting
emphasis on my apparent newsgroup naivete?  It's not like you are arguing
or saying anything of value, just...spiteful little jabs.  The kind you
level at someone for no other reason than they've previously irked you and
anything they say annoys the piss out of you.

I'd expect complete strangers to revel in their own superiority by
snarking at others...par for the course on usenet.  But having it done to
me by someone I'd been friendly with outside usenet is throwing me.
