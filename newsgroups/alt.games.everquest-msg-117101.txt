Yes it has worked. Admission in a public forum, of a crime, can be
used against you where you have no expectation of privacy. If you are
arrested, and not free to leave, you must be Mirandized. You always
have the right to remain silent, after arrest you are reminded that
you still have that right.

Of course they have to still prove that you had opportunity. I could
not walk into a Police station and say I kidnapped Lindbergh's baby
and be arrested. I may be Baker acted, but not arrested for that!
