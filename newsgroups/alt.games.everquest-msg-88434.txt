You mother kept telling you, always check the faction. :-)

I zone invis, check the area JUST INSIDE Oggok, cast DE (or Ogre)
illusion, recast invis, and make sure my bind point is in a safe
place, like Freeport docks, where it is when I get the tome.  I have
seen big uglies just inside after zoning.

I usually sell the Stien I have on me after I have the book, then make
the trek to Oggok to get the replacement. Same for ruby/star ruby
veil. I sell what I am wearing at the time, and replace it. Lots of
times lately I use a mule for selling, but for Stiens, I am selling as
I am ready to head for the replacement.

No thats called fun, punctuated by the promise of 100pp from someone
buying it. I guess thats why I am the lowest level guy in my guild...

When I am near a component I take care of the business of procureing
it. Near the dog, I make sure I have a reguratonic, near SF I pick up
a nitrate, in Odus, I get a innoruk's kiss. If I feel like a nut, I
get the Kiola.

I do it regularly, BUT A WARNING, keep on good terms with the dwarves.
I go on a Goblin killing spree and turn in beads in Kaladim to make
sure they know I still feel the love.

Yes, as usual. I always look before I leap. Leaping is tough enough.
