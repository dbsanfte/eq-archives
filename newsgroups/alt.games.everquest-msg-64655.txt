   I made a cat just to see new town. My 384 ram and Geforce 3 TI
500 in a 500mhz machine was not near enough for this zone.  I moved
in SLOW motion.  A buddy was there with a lot more than reccomended
system and he was haviing same trouble.  Oh well my Ogre not
scratching his ass every 2 minutes is worth something I guess.
Though I think I will go back to pre-SoL and see how it all
works/looks,  If it works better in all the pre-SoL zones (which had
some trouble for me too) I will return SoL and just stay with the
ass scratchin' Ogre.  I can't use all of the character modles anyway
and going from 19 to 15 made no difference in performance that I
could see though all zones were nearly empty (hate to see lag when
full now).

   I will give Verant some time to get things going a bit better
first.  This is a MAJOR undertaking and going to have some bugs for
a bit at least.
