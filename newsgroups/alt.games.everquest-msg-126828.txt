They NEVER wipe characters on Test.  ONE TIME like 2-3 years ago there
was an ITEM WIPE but that was due mainly to dev types giving away too
much nice junk with their GM accounts.

As for levels, there is the complete range of levels on test.  All of
the various epics have been gotten on test, and I believe all of the
high-level raids have been done.  There are PLENTY of 60's on the
server.
