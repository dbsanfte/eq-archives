I've often seen a Walrus there, but it has not been hostile.  I don't know
if anything else comes there on its own.  People do occasoinally fight near
the succor point, so you could pop in close enough to a fight to get aggro.

However, the succor point is so close to the WW zone that, assuming you
don't run the wrong way, you should be able to make it even if half the zone
has been trained to the succor point.
