Wrapped in the same spot for me when I read it (see my reply to
myself).  But when I quoted it and when you quoted it it still
wraps in the very same spot.  Now I figured that it would wrap at
the 65th character since thats what I told it to do, and when it
didn't I thought maybe my incoming wrap was doing the job.  But
if you see the same thing, well, what are the odds we both have
our incoming wrap at the same place?  Worse, when you quote me
that adds a character (the ">") so if I'm wrapping incoming at 78
characters then I should wrap your line, 79 characters long, back
at the 78, shouldn't I?

I also recall seeing someone else's nonwrapped text that Annie
was complaining about last week, wrapped at the full width of my
window, which is what I'd expect "wrap incoming to the width of
my window" to do.

Very confusing.
