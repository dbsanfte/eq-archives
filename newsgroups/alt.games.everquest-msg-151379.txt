I'm having the exact same issue.  The EQ game will freeze but the sound will
still continue on, if I wait a few moments the game picks up again but i
have not moved, however, if I had been kiting a mob, it will be where i
should have been if i hadn't froze up.

EQ-all expansions
AMD 1700 Processor
XP Pro with service pack
512 MB Ram
Geforce 2 Vid card.

Any ideas I would love to hear them.  Other games run just fine.  Unreal
2003 demo, BF1942, Warcraft 3, etc.
