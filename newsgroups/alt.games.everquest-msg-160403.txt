Yep.  Most elected offices here have terms of either 4 or 6 years, with some
staggering going on so that only some seats come up for election at a time.

This is what's called the mid-term election, since it's happening halfway
through the current president's term of office.  The mid-terms are usually
considered an indicator of how well people think the president's doing.  If
he's doing well, his party tends to gain seats.  If not, it tends to lose.

This election is important because it will determine who has control of the
Congress.  Right now, the two major parties are closely matched, but enough
seats are up for grabs that the balance can change.

This is also the first major election since 9/11, so it can also be
considered a referendum on how well people think that whole mess is being
handled, and whether or not to invade Iraq.

There are also several state and local elections, as well as state
governorships, up for grabs.

Presidential elections are every 4 years.  Next one will be in 2004, but the
campaign hype machines are probably going to start firing up in 6 or 8
months.
