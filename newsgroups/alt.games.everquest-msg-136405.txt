From the druid ring go SE and you pretty much run bang into the
tunnel.  From the tunnel, head straight east, you'll hit KC, from KC
keep going east and you'll hit the twin Iksar statues, and straight
ahead from there you can see the tunnel to FV.  Zone in.  Use your
EQatlas map to find the right vendor.  This takes all of five minutes.
