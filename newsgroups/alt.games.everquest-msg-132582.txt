Riiiiiight.  Just because I support their efforts to market their product
and wish them luck means I've got something to do with them... you'd make a
good Democrat.  Maybe you missed that I pointed out that I use traditional
media (you know, pencils, paint, etc..?); all I saw on their site is 3D.
Oh, and posting two off-hand responses, ooh, that's alot of effort.

I could care less.  I just wish them luck, while all you want to do is bash
them.
