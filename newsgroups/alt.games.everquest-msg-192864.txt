Up till about level 19 you'll still be using a weapon mostly to kill
things. Get yourself a decent weapon at the bazaar. If your starting
out in surefall glade / qeynos / blackburrow, do the newbie armour
quest to get armour, or if you have a bit of cash (unlikely if your a
complete newbie) buy armour from the bazaar. Everything is fairly easy
to get for the druid newbie armour quest, save for giant field rat
whiskers. Expect to spend an awful amount of time obtaining them (it's
-very- hard without tracking which you don't get till later). 

To get spiderling silks the easiest place is everfrost in the narrow
passages on the west side of the zone. Everything here is low level
and it's a fairly small area, you'll have no trouble getting the silks
you need. Just don't venture out into the open areas as the monsters
there are a lot higher level (stick to west side and narrow passages)
You get to everfrost through blackburrow (check www.eqatlas.com for
maps) 

Once you get to level 8-10 start hitting blackburrow, you need to go
down to the lower levels and kill at least patrolling gnolls which
will drop the ruined gnoll leather armour pieces you need for the
druid newbie armour quests.

Some good sites:

If you need any more help feel free to email me (check my sig for
email address). I was not so long ago a complete newbie druid.
