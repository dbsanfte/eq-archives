I wasn't playing any songs, except maybe Selos.  I do remember another thing
that may or may not be relevent;  There was a player nearby killing the
gypsies.  I saw her root one and nuke it from a distance while I sat there
and waited. I don't know if this would cause the gypsy to turn on me or not.

To answer another question;  No, I'm not on a PvP server.  And I don't know
why she made me kill one of the other gypsies... makes no sense to me.
