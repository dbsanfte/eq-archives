Nope - I use the mouse for movement (if I don't use W to move forward)
and for targetting, after getting used to it after decades of gaming.
(I rarely let go of the mouse other than to use both hands to type to
someone.)  My left hand always hovers over the tilde key and numbers 1
to 3 because I have the attack option keys there, and as I mentioned
above, the W key is always in easy reach to move forward.

Plus, as mentioned, I have stiff wrists and carpal tunnel syndrome in
my fingers, so by the time I leave go of the mouse, and move my stiff
wrists and hands, I could have clicked a button or three already.
I've never bothered with ALT+[gemslot] ever, firstly because I think
it's a crap way to do it (purely personal, no flame intended or
responded to) and secondly because why use two hands to do one action
when I can use a mouse and 3 buttons with my right hand to
point-and-click/move/target, AND mash other hotkeys simultaneously
with my left.
