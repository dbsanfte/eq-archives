Bet he wasn't level 54 though.  High 60's Druid with KEI and his own
mana regen buffs up could probably quad in PoN.  Not sure what he or
she would do if he got a really, really resistant to movement speed
change mob or mobs though [1].  Not sure the mobs wouldn't be light
blue either more often than not.

He isn't tanking them for long that's for sure.

[1] Had six resists on Ensnare on one Raven, root stuck fine though.
