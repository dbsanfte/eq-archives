Well I have been playing for two years, and I know many times I have run
into someplace and pulled one mob knowing I would be getting more, and
wanting to get more.  At that point they are pursuing me, I'm pulling all of
them, and we are in battle.  So what if I have not hit it yet, we are
engaged.  By this theory, I would infer that you think a cleric in your
group should not get EXP if all it did was heal, and not actually cause
damage to one of the mobs as it never actually engaged it.
