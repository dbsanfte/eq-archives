Thanks for the info.  We are going to try to gather up four MB wizards, I
think we can get them.  Add to that a 60 tank, and a 60 cleric.  As I
understand it, with that, what we will need is for the tank to get and hold
agro long enough for the wizards to manaburn, and, after that, well, the
fight is over.  Am I missing something here?

If we can't get the wizards, then we are planning all 55+, pulling in as
many friends as we can to assist, and possibly some friendly guilds that we
will in turn help when they are ready for it.  In that case, what you
described is basically what we understood to be the way to do it.
