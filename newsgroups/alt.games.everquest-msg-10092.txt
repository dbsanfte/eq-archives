Well for starters I'm rather new to this game, 2 weeks now...
Being a crafty and long thinking person I bind my Iksar
Necro on the stairs to the lower level of tower, then pull
a single furry Mob to my party, they proply trash it.
I wander back out to the stairs and its brothers (4) decide
that I was not a nice guy, chased me back to the party
(bad idea, they proply kick me), but I died immediately
then popped back in were the other brothers had just
spawned (3 more, fuzzy bastards). Screaming at the top
of my lungs, I ran for the safe room (and my corpse)
my party is all gone and three plus three means dead.
Respawn, no equiptment, and the fuzzys are between me
my corpse and the way out. Needless to say it took me
three more attempts (with equal results) to recover my
corpse and bind in a safer spot. (hard to respell while
running.) This game should be for mature audiences only.
;)
