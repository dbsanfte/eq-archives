It's not the Inspections really that bother me, it's the "Can I see your
XXXX" while I'm trying to Med. For those Non-Casters who don't know' this
stops my Mana regeneration, but I can still type so if you just ask about
the item I'll be more then happy to tell you about it. Not to mention asking
about it also seems to be more polite and in the spirit of RP to me.
