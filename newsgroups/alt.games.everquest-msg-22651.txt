Thanks to all who chimed in on my original question.  :)

Based on the advice, I've hoofed from Oasis to Unrest.  In my first
afternoon, I've learned four things:

1) This is a *high* aggro zone;
2) I *hate* Death Beetles;
3) The trains run regularly and on time;
4) I think I'd rather stay in Unrest than go back across Dag's.

This is what I'm doing for now ... please tell me if this is kosher or not.
Don't want to have the Unrest etiquette police come down on me ... I'm
definitely going to need to group here. <g>

I've bound myself on the Dag's side of the zone boundary to be safe.
Currently, I'm hanging out in the front yard wasting death beetles and
waiting for the inevitable train to come rolling by.  When it does, I assess
the train ... if there's stuff in it I can take, I'll Root 'N' Nuke the
caboose to lessen the numbers, then wait and catch the remaining mob(s) on
the rebound once the trainees have zoned.  If the mobs are over my head,
I'll gate and med while waiting for the front yard to clear from the train.
Repeat.

Good ... or bad?  Be honest ... don't want to torque people off.

Thanks!
Crash
