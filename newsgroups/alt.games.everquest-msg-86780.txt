Many places to go, but the nearest are Orc Hill till lvl 9 or so and
wildlife in BB. Orchill has the advantage of getting you Orcfist Belts,
which are used in a quest in Kaladim and give remendous exp plus cash plus
patchwork armor to sell. My druid went through lvl 7 and lvl 10 on pure
belts alone. Collecting enough to get my druid out of lvl 12 as well.
