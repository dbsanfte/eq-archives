Ah, but which do you use, the price the vendor will pay you for the item 
or the one the vendor will charge you for the item?

For example, what if there's a tinker recipie calling for a gear 
(vendors sell for 7pp), cog (vendors sell for 2pp), and pully (drop 
only).  The latter is a dropped item which vendors will pay 4 sp for, 
but charge 500pp for.  If I make the Golden Spinning Wheel, do vendors 
pay 9pp (cost of vendor bought items) or 9pp 4sp (what vendors will pay 
for the pully added in) or 509pp (cost if I'd bought the pully from a 
vendor someone else sold it to)

Selling gears back to the vendor you get 2 gp each.  Assuming you get 
1gp for a cog, another possibility would be 3gp 4sp; what the vendors 
would pay for the items, rather than what they sell the items for.

Further, there are many dropped items which can be used in trade skills 
which vendors will not offer one thin cp for, what do you value those at?

These are not unsolvable questions, but they are the sort of questions 
you'd have to ask if you wanted to put a formula in place instead of a 
crazy patchwork of vendor prices for tradeskill items.

Splendid One, 105 tinker (no idea what made me decide to work on this 
skill all of a sudden)
