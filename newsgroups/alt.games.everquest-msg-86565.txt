For classes that get tracking (rangers, druids, bards), the tracking
list will display the color level of NPCs (blue, yellow, etc.).  On a
PvP server, would other players' names also show up on tracking by
their color level (e.g., a level 10 ranger would see a level 11
player's name in yellow)?

Thanks in advance,
