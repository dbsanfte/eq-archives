You resent the rule? OH, you can't spell, neither can I. 

It is not a recent rule. It has been around in different groups since
I have been posting since, oh, July 2, 1990 (first googled one
anyhoo). It is an old rule that we use to respect everyone else's
bandwidth on USENET. Now, we like to keep the "mental" bandwidth low,
so bottom posting is easier to read in context. You simply cite the
text above with quote marks and insert your comment.

Back them a lot of people paid by the minute for connect time. They
didn't even propagate all the newsgroups to save bandwidth. I recall
getting a 9600 baud connection and a 10base-T backbone. My SUN
connection was a 7/8" cable. Bandwidth was important.

Now I must read 100 pages of text and info a day. I don't read stuff
thats hard to read normally.

What a load of rubbish. You post in English, then you post in
Mandarin, you can lef tor right post.

Ask your state trooper. I don't want you going 160 down my driveway.

It is not an internet standard, not technical changes are required.
Thats what standard means. It is a way for all users to get the most
out of this. It is still a rule.

I hope you change one thing, the world does not revolve around you. 

Please save that money.
