While medding at the small raptor island in Tim Deep this morning (and being
amazed at how my quadding skills have deteriorated while I've been spending
quality time with my big ol' ogre), I decided to do a little investigative
research. I went down the line and a '/w all <class> 55 60' for every class,
just to see what the class spread was of player levels 55 - 60.

This was done at around 10:00am Central on Cazic Thule. The given weaknesses
with /w (doesn't catch anons, etc.) apply.

Here's what I found:

Warrior - 11
Enchanter - 8
Wizard - 5
SK - 5
Ranger - 9
Mage - 5
Bard - 4
Shaman - 6
Pally - 9
Necro - 4
Monk - 3
Cleric - 10
Beastlord - 1
Druid - Your request was cut short .. too many players.

Looks like it's not just my guild that's druid heavy. :-)
