simply put, VI is running scared, DAoC is gonna kill eq if they dont do
something.
so simple answer, copy DAoC. move quick to implement all the features DAoC
will have when it ship.
hide the server numbers so no one see the user base drop thru the floor,set
up servers that we for 18 months have said couldn't be done (rp server)
it all comes down to , to little to late...eq was a great game, but it was
given to vindictive childern to run...if you fire brad and his pack of pr
idiots and hire some people that have a CS clue they might be able to
salvage some of the player base.
other than that i predict the first server MERGE inside of 6 months after
camelot ships
