Actually, I did not assume is is still there, although I can see how that 
could be misinterpretted.  If I had actually assumed he was still there, I 
just would have mentioned him and where he is, without putting in the 
"assuming he is still there" bit.  I bought a few spells from him, as, pre 
PoP, he was far easier to get to.
