  Just as going by the number of complaints you read on boards isn't
exactly a way to perfectly gauge how many people are having trouble, I
wouldn't judge by the number of people who are in "market zones" and
city zones either.  A lot of people may be experiencing severe
gameplay hindering problems (frequent linkdeaths, bad frame rates,
crashing/freezing, weirded out graphics) but still can get in the
game.  Those people aren't likely to run off to their usual hunting
area, but they might stick around in a safe area to socialize in
guildspeak and /auction stuff.

  Just something to keep in mind.
