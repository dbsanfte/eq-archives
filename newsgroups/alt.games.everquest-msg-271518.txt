http://plurpage.com/everquest/aug.php is a useful augment generator.  If you 
just want ultravision, the only non-vendor bought items you would need are 
any of the oow augment stones and a Slugworms.  Everything else would be 
vendor bought.  You would need the services of a jewler and either a rogue 
with high make poison or a shaman with high alchemy.
