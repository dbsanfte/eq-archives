    I do it all the time. When you get pickup groups, like the majority of
players in the game do, you don't have much choice as to who you get grouped
with. You can say "Not him, he's a total moron", but try saying "His
taunting skills have me getting hit 15% more frequently" and see where it
gets you. It also allows me to take aggro away from an enchanter when I have
to, which is a situation where the tanks CANNOT help.

    If I choose to do that bit of roleplaying, yep, it sure is. Otherwise it
becomes the pointless gacking of 'toons, and at high levels not even many
'toons per unit time to bring some excitement to things. I've been on raids
against things you would consider "gimp" - Inny, ToV - and really, being a
high level cleric is pure tedium. Either the order in which I cast my heals
is pre-determined, and I robotically hit my CHeal key when my time is up, or
I spend my time /assisting off the active mobs and casting one of
Remedy/Divine Light/CHeal. Oh, and I buff, but not much since I'm not 60.
When I'm in a six-man group, I'm casting MoK, stunning, making MANY more
decisions per unit time about healing, using alternate heals like Celestial,
helping co-ordinate the group.... I'm a CLERIC, not an account with a
high-level cleric on it.

    I don't begrudge you your enjoyment of top level raids, or doubt that
you get a charge when after 15 minutes that boss mob finally drops - but for
me, it's sheer tedium. How has your cleric retention rate been? On my
server, the top guild has lost five of seven Halos awarded to clerics who
either left to a lesser guild, or just plain quit - and most quit.
