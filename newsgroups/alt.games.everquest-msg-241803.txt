Yeah, at least where I was it just sent me to the succor point. I was
in Frontier mountains and running one character through the tunnel to
burning woods while my other character was en route. The second
character impacted on a wall of the tunnel, where normally it would
run in place until I got back to it. Well, since that DX9 change it
instead went through the wall into some void. Then it was falling in a
gray void, luckily it then said something like:

Falling through the world, you are being moved to the safe point

Then I was at the succor point, better than dying I guess.
