You sound like someone ranting after discovering it is good manners to say
<please> and <thank you>.

"I have mannners - but I don't see why I should have to use them all the
time. You people are just _pathetic_ in expecting me to use them..."

Be polite, or be rude. It's up to you. If you find that being polite is
stressing you out too much, then go ahead and be rude. Just remember that
everything has consequences.
