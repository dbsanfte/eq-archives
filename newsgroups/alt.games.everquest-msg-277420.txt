I find it amusing that assistance and worthwhile groups are harder to find 
in Qeynos areas than Freeport ones, in spite of there being a substantial 
population advantage.  At least that's the way it's been on the RP preferred

When in Freeport areas, help's fairly easy to find, but you can't OOC or the 
Qeynosians in the zone will take the mob, even if they're twenty levels past 
grey.
