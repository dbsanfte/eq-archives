Perhaps the last patch changed the dopropertinting line in the eqclient to
TRUE by default. This feature has been around for well over a year now,
where the places your body is not covered by a tinted material can be seen
as intended rather than dyed. However, people have normally had to set this
line in their ini to true in order to make it work, and sadly a lot of
people never heard of it from what I've read on some boards.

It may be that no one else seems to notice the change because they had
dopropertinting on already? Just an idea. At any rate, that's awesome, glad
to hear it's looking a lot better for you now!
