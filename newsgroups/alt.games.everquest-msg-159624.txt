Simply put.  I will laugh my ass off when the support for EQ1 drops to near
nil.  Do I like the game?  Yes.  Do I think they could have made a better
effort to make this Holloween atleast comparible to last years?  Yeah.  But,
do I also feel there will be a day not too far away that will bring forth
the end of EQ1?  Yep, sooner than most WANT to believe.  Denial is a bitch.
