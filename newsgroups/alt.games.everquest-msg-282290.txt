Mana pool around 3000.  Best spell around 4 to 1 damage/mana ratio.  
Mana regen of around 30/tick.  That allowed for killing a blue with 
maybe 5 minutes recovery time.

For kiting more than one at a time with AE, the spells do less damage 
per mob for a given amount of mana, so that would take about 90-95% of 
my mana, giving around 10 minutes down.

Wizards were not fast soloists. :-)
