I have found little use for language skills in EQ so far (other than RP)
apparently they were required for research info long ago in the days before
spoiler sites.
Not sure why you can't train in other languages...there should be some your
guild master can teach you. My Dark Elf has an abundance of languages he can
learn.

The skill system only gives a numerical number after 100 (master) Which is
why common has this figure.
From experience you can only learn a language to the level of the player
teaching you (spamming in Group Chat, in other words) My Wood Elf has
Tier'dal as master, Elder Tier'dal at Above Average and Elder Dragon at Very
Good (these are all the levels My Dark Elf has) and of course my Dark Elf
can speak Elvish Fluently (master) but both characters spamming in ET'D or
ED will not give the other a raise, I need to find someone better in these
languages.
