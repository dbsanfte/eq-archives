Grats on your shiny new Willsapper. Very nice item to have and I know I will 
want to get my own SK one who by the way also happens to be a Gnome. 
Personally I enjoy ingame sounds and music so I always use audible prompts 
for important events to bring them to my attention. I would for a slow so I 
knew to bandolier a better weapon in one the Willsapper has landed a slow 
for me.

This is kind of funny but I always have an audible sound for this phrase: 
"you feel yourself"
