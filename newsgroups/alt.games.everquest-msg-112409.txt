Exactly, too BSable and no point really since ever bard now can be a
dark elf anyway. I'd only believe it if some good race masks were as
easy to get as the dark elf mask on test (all good race ones are only
for prestige (or the stats I guess), since all bard races really don't
need them, and MUCH harder to get.)
