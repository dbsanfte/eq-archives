Rogues can be decent soloers at higher levels.  Just work your intimidate
and backstab skills up.  Sneak/hide to get behind a mob, backstab to start
the melee.  Intimidate, when successful will turn the mob and have him
flee....free backstabs for that.  If you have the plat, get a Myrlokar's
breast plate so you can get some quick 100hp heals in.  My typical solo
strategy is to intimidate, throw the backstab and then clickie heal until
the mob is coming back.  This works great, but make sure you only do this in
zones that are safe to fear mobs in... no point having a weakened mob bring
20 or 30 of his closest friends back to discuss things.....
