MObs spawn with coin on them. The amount is not always divisible by
the number of members in the party that kills it. So, autosplit
divides it up as fairly as possible by giving an even number of each
coin to each party member, then whatever is left to the person
looting. In a full group, this can be a significant disparity. If a
member loots 5 p 5 g 5 s 5 c, they will get all of it and no one else
will get anything.

The best solution to this is to group with people you trust, let one
person loot, then divide it all up as evenly as possible at the end.
