The failure mode I remember, as of the DX9 graphics upgrade, was
that when the boat started to leave the dock, the passengers would
stay in place.  It was actually a sort of Wiley Coyote thing,
because I found I could stay standing in midair as long as I didn't
try to move.  As soon as I moved at all, I'd fall into the water.
(When this happened to my druid I said to heck with that, and Gated
out from midair. :-)  You could sometimes get the boats to work by
running in the direction of the boat's movement as it set off, but
it may well be that the "slide off the boat at the zone line" would
then kick in.

I think the developers must've decided that nobody likes the boats
anyway, so they don't see any reason to fix them.  And I do have
to admit that I really like being able to get from Nedaria/Natimbi
directly to Abysmal Sea without waiting an average of several minutes
for a barge; it puts a bank within seconds of every LDON camp.  But
I do wish they'd put back the boats, while maybe leaving the gnomes
in place as well.  (They'd have to tweak the translocators' speech a
bit.)

As others have noted, there are several reasons why the boats are
still useful: (1) Sometimes the docks aren't safe due to faction
or other issues.  (2) Not all boats have equivalent translocators.
(I think you need to be LDON-enabled, which means level 15, to use
the Magus to get to Abysmal Sea.)  (3) Some of the boats were just
neat to ride, once.  A friend has told me I really should ride the
icebreaker ship just to see it, but I can't!
