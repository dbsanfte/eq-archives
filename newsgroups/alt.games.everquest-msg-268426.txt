I rarely use a spell checker, but I'm one of the annoying people who 
will post spelling corrections for other people's posts.

I didn't type any of what you responded to, that was a cut and paste 
job, I just was amazed at how easy it was for me to read the whole 
thing, as long as I just scanned over it instead of trying to follow one 
word at a time.  It wasn't like figuring out a puzzle, if I ignored my 
natural inclination to stop and wrestle with the words, I actually knew 
what they all were.

I thought sure, I'd get a misspelled word in context, from it fitting in 
to the rest of the sentence.  But these were all misspelled (with the 
exception of a the or so here and there)

I'm sure its been around forever, just new to me...
