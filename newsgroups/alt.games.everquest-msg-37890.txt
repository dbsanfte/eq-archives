Not sure that's right unless they've changed this since release.
Basically, the non-expansion player gets a "zone unavailable" message.
Everybody with the expansion takes off. I was sending people to ice
clad before I had the expansion. The only trouble the porter will have
is that ice clad port spell is the only spell sold outside the
expansion so I hope he has a friend willing to go to WL and buy them
for him.

BTW At the time of Ice Clad, when you did one of these types of spells
without the expansion; there was a bug that left the non-porting
porter's button and spell gems locked up. Attempts to use console
commands to cast a spell or attack would relieve a message that the
port spell you cast was still unresolved (in other words, the program
thought you were still in the process of casting the spell.) The only
way to resolve the issue was to zone or log off/on. Recently I sent
our guildleader to WL on guild business. My dragon faction is
threatening but hers was dubious. I removed the tooth from my person
and cast the port off she went, I stayed behind. The button commands
no longer locked up, very nice. :-)
