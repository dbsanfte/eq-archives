I played AC for almost 2 years, my highest was like level 28. I don't 
play fast, I don't worry about power leveling. I like to explore the 
land, do the quests, just waste time really. One of the last things I 
worry about is the XP grind.

Yeah, I may see how I feel at the end of the 30 day trial, if I'm still 
hooked, then the new platinum edition for $30 is pretty much a no-brainer.
