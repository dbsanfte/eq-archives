OK, let's look at another example of evil:
The merchants of Venice in the Thirteenth Century during the Crusades.

In the Fourth Crusade, the Pope sent troops to crush Saladin's forces in
Egypt as a tactical maneuver.  When those troops boarded the ships in
Venice, the merchants took them instead to Constantinople, the folks the
Crusaders were originally called to help.  Because the merchants of Venice
wanted to cripple their economic rival, the Byzantine Empire, they looted
and raped and pillaged Constantinople...and left it bloodied and weakened,
at the mercy of the Turks.

In the Childrens' Crusade, groups of children sought to use love and
sentimentality to conquer where swords and bloodshed had failed.  When they
reached Italy, the merchant loaded the children onto ships, took them to the
Middle East, and sold them as slaves to the Muslims (except for some of the
girls, whom the Italian merchants kept for their own brothels.)

Now, tell me, do you think these merchants of Venice were acting out of the
ideal of "the Greater Good?"  Certainly, as a class, they weren't all
uniformly insane, were they?
