I read the question, and understood the question. I also read the rest
of the post, and understood the ultimate situation. You want to run EQ,
go afk, and at some point after that, do some video capture without
returning to your computer. I offered a solution to the problem as a
whole, rather than a specific step. No need to solve a problem, if you
can totally remove the problem is there?

I did not specifically answer the title question, because my solution to
reaching the final goal, totally removed the necessity for encountering
that specific problem.

BTW, please stop being so damn condescending in your replies. Makes me
wonder why the hell I bothered trying to help when you talk down to
everyone by pointing out punctuation and comprehension that's obvious.
