Oddly, beg seems to work as a taunt when it fails
not when it succedes (this part isn't odd but the
consequence is) so you want to -avoid- mastery
of the skill!  Use it strictly as a taunt boost in
combat, and even then not reflexively but only
when you -need- the taunt.  While the taunt skill
should be used constantly unless you need something
to taunt off of you, you don't want beg going up
any more than necessary.

Insofar as getting rich off the skill, no, its not
worth it, most I ever heard of anyone getting
is a gold piece, and that's with beg in the 180+ range,
begging from a high level mob.  If you went thru all
the effort of getting your beg skill maxed out at levels
low enough for this kind of cash to matter, you'd still
have to suffer the more usual result of the high level
mob you begged turning around and killing you.

If you want free money, take up fishing.  Won't
make a fortune on that either, but -vastly- more
than on begging.
