Where do you get this?  What's wrong with level appropriate equipment and
buffs?  Makes it too difficult?  No one ever said that a level 60-plus
warrior should still be wielding rusty short swords, but should a level 1 be
wielding anything other than a Short Sword*?  Why do they have to have a
Wurmslayer?

It's your argument that's a "LOAD OF CRAP".
