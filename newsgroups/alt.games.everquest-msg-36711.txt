The biggest train i ever saw was in unrest.  I was 17 at the time and was
asked to join a group that needed a healer.  No problem i thought.  There
was me, 2 18 tanks and our idiot puller who was a 16 ranger.   I should have
figured there was a problem when everyone in the group was talking about
"having fun with a hag"  Our ranger goes in and and comes back out.  "i
dunno guys i shot 3 dry bones with my bow and none of them agroed on me."  5
minutes later after beating up some yard trash and i was oom we hear shouted
across the zone "Why is the house empty?"  Then the back door of the house
opens and everything rushes our group.  We had hags, the undead knight,
every type of skeleton imaginable, the ghosts and a special guest appeance
by the Priest of Najena.  The ranger lasted for about 30 seconds max, long
enough for the rest of us to run.  I proved once again why Divine Aura is
one of my favorite spells.   Feel sorry for anyone who got caught in that
mess, but seeing the whole house come out those backdoors was pretty funny.
