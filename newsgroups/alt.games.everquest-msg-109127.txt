Nope. Its a microsoft game so its hosted by the microsoft gaming zone
(god i love cribbage) and it just requires that you make a user id. In
DS you can make one right from the multiplayer select. Online games
are handled the way open battlenet is on diablo2...no gms or one
single server like im used to in EQ now.....people host a game and
other people join. Its a lot of fun and for 29 bucks i thought the
sheer eye candy was cool.
