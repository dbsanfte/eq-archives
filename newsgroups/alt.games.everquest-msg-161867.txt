Welcome then....

If you buy PoP, you'll get the "classic" everquest (pre expansions) plus
Planes of Power. As a noob, this means that the Planes will serve as little
more than a way of getting around (very much worth it though).

You can download a free copy of the classic and a 30 day trial. You'll find
that you still need to give credit card info if you're not buying the game
cards (which aren't returnable), but that's so they can ding you with those
ongoing charges beyond 30 days.

My two bit advice: Download the classic, and try it out. Stick with a
character class that starts in the Greater Faydark area (Kelethin or
Felwithe) or Freeport, as these are where you will find a decent number of
people willing to help you out as a newb. The learning curve in this game is
STEEP at first, so be patient, but this is a low cost way of trying it out
some.

Now, having said that, realize that the classic game is what it sounds -
dated. The graphics are not nearly as easy on the eyes (very sharp edges to
everything - including the people), and you won't have any of the "prettier"
zones available to you (including the bazaar, which is the hub of commerce
in Norrath these days). So, what you should be focusing on to see if you
like it is the general character and grouping concepts as well as general
game play.

Give it at least a week - if you're going to stay with it, then I highly
recommend going out and buying the PoP gold collectors tin at around $69 -
it has all expansions. You'll see the new graphics, have all zones
available, etc., etc., etc..

One more thing: As a newb to the game, I would strongly suggest staying away
from PvP for your first server and play experience. Also, avoid a few
classes that tend to be just too much to play well at first - in particular,
I would stay away from Bards (was my first toon and still is, but I had no
idea how masochistic I was being doing that as a first toon), necros,
enchanters, and beastlords. Avoid "evil" races too as a first run if you ask
me - it's hard to get to know the game when 80% of the "people" on norrath
want you dead.
