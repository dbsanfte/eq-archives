You got a souped up version or what? Aren't normal ones 30s cast? ;)

I believe meditate is capped at level 60 so +5% there will not help you 
one bit. I prefer my hiero cloak, but this isn't bad either.

Unfortunately I have this too.

Hmm that's a nice one, perhaps I should get one too so I don't have to 
swap in my SCHW when playing with the hammer.

Oh no! You could probably get a shadel bandit ring solo (use WoT to 
single them, I've done that many times). Or just find a partner and do 
it faster. 6ac 55hp/mana, 10vsdisease 5vscold. For second finger 
(unfortunately shadel rings are lore) I don't really have a good 
suggestion. I have a jaded velium ring, 5ac 30 hp/mana which is quite 
sucky (although a little better than wis7 rings IMO ;).

Manafree water. Don't leave home without it.. :)

I keep this in a bag and swap it in sometimes. Most of the time I use a 
crystal chitin shield 20ac 9wis 40mana. Got it for a few k in bazaar.

This is what I want to upgrade to, not bad at all.
