No.  It doesn't.  The combat effect of Str is only to increase the
maxumum amount of damage you can do.  It wont' effect how many times
you hit for max damage at all.  You'll still be hitting for your magic
number the vast majority of the time.  And seeing as how maximum
damage hits are so very rare in the first place, the effects of high
str are trivial to your average damage at best.

dismiss...
