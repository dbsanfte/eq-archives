Well, if you have the SoL disks... just install the game with the updated
textures (or old ones), then run the patch (there will be no shortcuts
created for you) and try to log into your old account, it SHOULD still be
there... if not you will need to get the original or kunark cd to start a
new account
anyways if you get in, register SoL and youre all set. you just wont be able
to travel to Velious or get the interface "enhancements" it gives
