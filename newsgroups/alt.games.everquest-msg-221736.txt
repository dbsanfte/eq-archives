It's been a while since I took statistics but as I remember, "runs" of
one particular result are more common than people usually expect.  We
were looking at the likelihood that you would flip a coin and have it
land heads, 10 times in a row, or something like that.  This might be
much more likely than for a 1:20 result occuring 6 times in a row. 
However when you consider that you can end up doing hundred or
thousands of any particular combine, sooner or later you will have
what appears to be an impossibly unlikely "run".  Remember that you
have probably hit that combine button, just for making leather
padding, a few hundred times.  Add to this the fact that you have
probably done hundreds or thousands of other trivial combines.  Sooner
or later you will get 5, 6, 7 in a row.

Out of curiosity, I tested the likelyhood that you would fail 6 times
in a row, using the best statistics that I could remember.  Given 1000
tries the chances were still impossibly low.  (0.01%)  However, I
don't know if I did the stats correctly.  So take that as you will.
