I noticed a lot of these were spawning in lake rathe, which is where I'm
working on my epic 1.0 druid. I didn't get close enough to find out if i was
kos, having been summoned as an innocent bystander one too many times, and
was wondering if anyone could tell me if they are kos to everyone, and what
the best tactic to get epic 1.0 is when people are getting 2.0 around you?
