I got digital cable recently and there is a channel called G4, its an all
gamming network (I hadn't heard of it).
They had a commercial promoting the network that was amusing.

They open on a guy applying for a job at a suit and tie type of company.The
employer is looking over the guys resume and he likes what he sees .He
rattles of some of the impressive things on the resume then he stops and
looks confused at a certain point.
he looks up at the guy and says:
"What is this?What does this mean,..39 level beast lord?"

I thought it was funny ,thought I'd share it.
