Peridot is a minor gemstone. It is also the reagent (casting component) for
some Cleric spells in EQ that increase hitpoints.

To prevent this happening (and also to avoid my investment getting dispelled
by random caster mobs), I would usually cast symbol as the last buff on a
group (or a new groupmember). AC is the most expendable, so I usually go:
Aegis (or Bulwark), Hero, then symbols.

As to one-liners, it really depends how mean you want to be. It could be
anything from:
"Hey can I at least get dinner and some cuddle time before you run off with
my symbol?"
to:
"Any other buffs you want me to waste my mana on before you leave, Your
Majesty?"

But as a Cleric, really no revenge compares to just adding bad or flaky
people to the "do not res or help" list that all Cleric players keep next to
their computers.
