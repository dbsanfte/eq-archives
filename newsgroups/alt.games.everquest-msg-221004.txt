    Knights have always been able to get and hold aggro, even in the days of
low mana regen. I remember the only thing they couldn't do that a warrior
could do was both pull and tank, as they needed some rest time if they
weren't in a group with a proper cc class (all of which had mana regen
boosts). What has changed is the casters. They now have sustainable DPS far,
far ahead of anything they used to be capable of doing. They can draw aggro
off a tank by merely nuking at what, for them, is an infinitely sustainable
level. So when someone tells them "control your aggro", what they're
actually saying is "stop doing as much damage as you're capable of doing".
And no DPS class will accept that.

    You're a rogue, Davian. Imagine that Evade greyed out your Backstab key.
Would you be terribly thrilled being with a tank that required you to Evade
all the time?

    James
