Yeah, my account expired, but yesterday I logged into my friends to test
DX8... its working on my card now (Radeon VE). It seemed smoother, but at
the same time choppier... the choppiness came in waves but besides that the
rest was better. my friend I logged in was a barb shammie, with a plate type
helm, only thing I noticed was the horns had a few black spots on them, and
all the corpses on the ground in LoIO and FM were naked... but that might be
just from a patch *shrug*
I'm happy theyre releasing Luclin with working out most of the DX8 bugs
though... I didnt think they would make it
