Worst to best...

Scowls at you ready to attack (as KOS as you get)

Glares at you threateningly (still KOS but not as much, can RUN by them and
not too close and you're usually OK from what I've seen).

Dubious (they hate you, enough to not talk or deal with you but not enough
to want you dead)

Apprehensive (they still strongly dislike you, but they'll still talk to
you, and the greed of the merchants doesn't prevent selling)

Indifferent (don't really care either way, they'll talk to you as normal,
but you could still get better with them)

Amiably (they like you, not a whole lot but some)

Kindly (they like you allot now)

Warmly (consider them good friends now)

Ally (the ultimate in goodness with them, total opposite of KOS)

Consider it a scale of 1 to 9, 1 being lowest and 9 being highest.
If you really want to get accurate, its a scale of 0 to 10.
0 = You're so KOS your faction can't be lowered any more (I believe you get
the message that your faction can't possibly get any worse, for a true role
player, this might be what they want)
10 = You're liked so much you can't possibly make them like you any more
(Also I believe at this point you see the message that your faction can't
possibly get any better).

As you get farther to each end of the extreme, the margins from one /con to
another are far greater.
