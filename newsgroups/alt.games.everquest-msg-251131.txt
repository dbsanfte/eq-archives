These classes get a new pet every new spell level, more or less, so they 
have viable pets over most of their lives

Classes with powerful controllable pets
Necromancers (level 1)
Magicians (level 4)
Beastlord  (level 9)
Shaman (level 34)

Classes with powerful pets they can't control (until high level with 
lots of AA points)
Enchanters (level 1)

These classes get a pet at a certain level, and never get a replacement, 
so its only good for a few levels (if ever)

Classes with a pet which they can't control and which commits suicide 
when their target dies
Clerics (level 54, useless by level 60)
Wizards (level 58, useless by level 60)

Classes with a pet which is incredibly wimpy
Druid  (level 56, but its the same pet that shaman got at 34, more or 
less... useless by level 40 or so)

So yes, all casters (and beastlords, which aren't casters really) get 
pets... but they vary a lot, and most of them don't get -really- count 
as pet classes; only the first category would count as that for me.

Splendid One, 62 mage, Firiona Vie
Bergh, 65 cleric, Morell Thule
Matte, 30 enchanter, Morell Thule
