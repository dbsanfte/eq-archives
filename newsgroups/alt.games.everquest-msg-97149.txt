At level 20, I headed out to the plains of EF to group Mammoths.  The tusks
have a good resell value with the merchants and if you can find a Shammy to
summon you some Spirit Pouches you'll be all set!  Mams are great xp...

Also, soon you will be able to group at Split Paw too.  Again, great xp and
fairly good loot considering how many fine steel weapons drop there.

Remember that in the case of Spirit Pouches, they will disappear with
anything in them if you log for 30 min or more.  That may sound silly to
say, but I've heard lots of people who were upset at logging and finding
that their bags of tusks and or FS were gone upon relogging.

As for weapons, I have no clue...  My Ranger has a BALS, a Wak of the Frozen
Skies, and Morin's Short Sword.  Certainly not top weapons, but they do the
job for me...

Take care!
