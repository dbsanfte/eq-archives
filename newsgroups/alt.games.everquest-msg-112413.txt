I am no expert on the zone - but through a little reading got the impression
the status of the war is decided by player action. By enabling a particular
faction to occupy three spawn sites then it triggers the war, and by killing
certain critters you can end it. It would be wort reading up about it if
there is an extended war on your server as that is when the good stuff drops
off the named - and not necassarily just owlbears. there are named grimlings
and sonic wolves too.
