I'd love to see it.  I'm NOT disagreeing a single bit, it
just always seems to me that Block absolutely destroys
Parry if you're comparing effectiveness, EVEN THOUGH
I have better AC and more HPS than one of our guild's
main "tank" monks.  It's not parsed data, but I swear I
think that when he tanks a mob, he comes out better
through 'em than I do.  Again, this is maxxed skills,
all the damage avoidence/mitigation AA's, and against
the same mobs (crit a drake for 4000 damage in
a double-tap and see if evade helps ;-)  ).  It just seems
that he doesn't get hit like I do, and again, I have both
a higher AC and more HPS than he does.

I guess I'll have to parse to be sure..but I usually leave
that to him.  He grumbles about my damage numbers
when I parse (because I always highlight his and mine
;-)  ).

Hmmm...I see no problem with this...
