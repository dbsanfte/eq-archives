There are no true, hardfast rules aside from what your ISP sets up for
posting on Usenet. There ARE, however, rules of etquitte, which will
get you severely flamed if you break them.

Oh, yes, and there IS one *BIG* rule against selling characters
anywhere. Ever read that little list of terms that pops up every time
