Soooooo......... let me just say that we owned wherever we went.

There are some obvious shortcomings to this type of group:

mana efficiency flies out the window; the mobs just die too damn fast
for dot's to be effecient
everyone want's the same drops; there wasn't a skeleton to be found in
FoB except 'ol Bones within 5 minutes.
you've got 6 people grouping with a class that is completely
self-sufficient up to 65

There may be more but we've not expereinced them yet.

On the other hand, there hasn't been anything so far that even had a
chance of standing up to us.  Average level of 9 and we took out 4
Burynai Excavators in the FoB pit simultaneously.  All were very red
to us.
XP flows like water in that group even far away from PC.  It's as if
there just aren't enough mobs to kill.

We have another group of all melee DPS that we also play; we're
somewhat flighty that way.  Personally I think the melee group is much
more effecient in the basest sense, at least until 30-35.  At that
point the mobs have enough HP's that several stacked DOT's may
actually run their course.  Along with 6 pets beating the tar out of
the mob.  I almost felt sorry for some of them this week....

In any case, somewhere within the 6 pets, snare, fear, conversions,
taps, dot's, FD, and summon corpse is the Necromancer Death Squad (aka
Death from Below and Three Feet Under).

Did I mention they're all gnomes?
