Most 1H weapons are better...they are generally faster, and faster means
more applications of the primary hand damage bonus. Also, it allows pallys
and SKs to bolster themselves by adding a shield, something you don't find
any warrior past like level 10 using.

That being said, if you have any chance of getting the epic, keep your 2HS
up...both of those weapons are quite good, especially since they allow you
to bash with no shield. Unfortunately, they are both quite difficult to get
(The SK one in particular), so have to decide if it is worth the bother.
