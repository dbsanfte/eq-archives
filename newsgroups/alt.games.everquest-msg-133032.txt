It could be.  I read your statement as, 'They lack the tools! This is an 
insurmountable problem!'...  My response, of course, is, "well, give them 
the tools".

}It probably doesn't have derivations, either ;_;

Actually, it might be just the ticket.  It basically lays all the 
groundwork for figuring out where derivatives come from.  Doesn't really 
get into doing derivatives and integrals, but it might give you a good 
footing to tackle it from.
