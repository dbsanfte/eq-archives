Always carry components and keep it running on yourself whenever you
are in danger.

Also keep it on the main tank, but more importantly on your chanter
if you have one.  Chanters simply shatter if looked at funny, without
all the HP buffs you can slap on them you'll be spending all your time
resing them... and likely the rest of the party if having a chanter was
part of the operating plan.

If money is an issue, announce the cost of the gems you are using
and expect to be compensated out of the loot fund for those two
(hopefully three) targets.

Anyone else who wants symbol might be expected to pay for
it privately, but -you- -main tank- and -chanter- are all getting
it for the good of the party.

If money isn't a big issue, just carry the stones and cast at will.

Here's a trick for the whiners: carry stones for your next lowest
symbol, and mem it alongside your best.  Buff the real targets
with your best, and the rest of the group with your second best;
that one costs a tenth what your "real" one does, takes less
mana, and does from half to two thirds what your best would.
As far as the message you get goes, you'd be unable to tell
I didn't buff everyone with the same spell.  I"ve -never- been
called on this directly, although a few "secondary" targets have
quietly handed me peridot and recieved the "better" recast.
At lower levels I did this for the savings, but these days the
issue is actually the mana; its much cheaper in mana to only
jasperize the people that -shouldn't- be getting hit anyway.
Heck, I often Jasperize myself... I shouldn't be getting hit
in most situations, either!

Stones are light in weight and stackable.  I go thru them faster
than water, but I simply buy accordingly.  Its rare that I go
thru more than two stacks of peridot and two

Yes, everyone -should- carry stacks of their own.  And of
bat wings, pearls, and components for any other spells they
might want.  Sad fact is, most don't.  But most people do
carry cash, or at a minimum loot it.  If you are using ML,
its a simple matter of keeping track of symbols cast and
gettting that settled up when loot is split.  Other methods
I've seen are having the cleric loot all the bodies and keep
all the cash, giving the cleric the gem loot, splitting the
cost and having each player pay the cleric... and the ever popular
ignore the issue and let the cleric foot the bill... as you note,
once you hit 39 you have an alternate source of income.

will res for ale... but often find people giving me peridot in
its stead, as though I can drink those!
