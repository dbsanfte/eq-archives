OK, so as a followup to this:

Is it killing the king/chief/whatever that triggers the war? I've heard that
there are some nasty faction hits if you don't successfully defend them -
any truth to that? I would presume that, even if there are such hits, that
they could be avoided by zoning right away (though you might want to use the
BB zone out).
