I love dungeon crawls.  On Friday night a group of six of us went over
the floating walkways in Plane of Torment.  No one seems to hunt in
this zone but it is wicked fun.  Reminded me of the old D&D planes,
big scary mobs, powerful magics including mobs that silence.  It was
excellent.  We wiped out trying to go into one of the buildings, but
the graveyard got us back on our feet.

On Saturday I led a crawl of Kaesora down into the library.  This is
one of my favorite dungeons, I know it like the back of my hand now. 
Two groups of 30s and 40s, myself and a 55ish ranger all went down. 
The ranger killed Xalgoz and got a howling stones key.

On Sunday we crawled through Veskar but a lot of it was taken so we
had to go pretty far in to kill any mobs.  Another excellent dungeon,
great lighting, great artwork and excellent looking mobs.

Dungeon crawling is one of my favorite activities now that experience
grinding has lost its appeal to me (level 65 with 125 AA points). 
Unfortunately, dungeon crawling is significantly harder than it should
be.

If SOE wants to improve dungeon crawling they should add graveyards to
the many of the mid to high level dungeons including Guk, Dalnirs,
Nurga, Droga, Dragon Necropolis, Sirins Grotto, Crystal Caverns, Tower
of Frozen Shadows, Velkators, Kael, Akheva, Sebilis, The Hole, Howling
Stones, and Natox.  It makes no sense that level 65 groups should have
it so easy in Plane of Fire but the level 30s group risks complete
disaster in Dalnirs Crypt.
