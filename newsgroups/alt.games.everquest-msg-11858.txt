I have a DE Warrior and though she may not be as strong as some of the other
classes, she fights very well.  As you get older that dual weild/double
attack is very helpful.  I've all but given up my 2hander but still have it
to keep the skill maxed.  My hubby just started a Dwarven warrior and he
levled him to 3 in no time.  Stay away from the night-blind races, they are
good warriors, but I sure would miss being able to see in the dark no matter
what.  Just my 2cp worth.
