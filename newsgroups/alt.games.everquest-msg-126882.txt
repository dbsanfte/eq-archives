You realize, of course, that typing out a url is going to be
ultimately slower because it's not as "intuitive"...

Also, you are counting just the additional amount of typing required
by typing the latter paragraph over the single lines given as examples

Even 10-15 seconds longer is trivial. At least in my opinion. Then
again, I'm not one of those people that freaks out over every lost
second of my life...
