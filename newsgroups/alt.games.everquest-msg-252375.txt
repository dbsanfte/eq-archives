I actually found the movie very faithful to the book in flavor, if not in
all details.

The reason for the bad reviews, in my opinion, is that people were expecting
a 21st century science fiction movie, and got a 1960s science fiction movie.

Doogie isn't in it much.  =)

Dina Meyer, thankfully, is.
