Because not being good enough to raise your skill on it doesn't by any
means mean that you're perfect at it. You need to work on other things
to find new methods to apply to the lower combines that work better.

And, again, that's YOUR opinion. Obviously, it's not shared by the
creators of the game (who's opinion in the end is the only one that
makes any real difference) or by apparently the majority of players.

Your opinion is based off of assumptions, which makes it flawed.

No, there's no indication of what they "should" be. It's completely
random. Pick up, say a 10-sided dice. Rolle it 40 times and see how
many times it lands on 1. There's a chance it could hit it all 40
times or never at all, even though statisticly the chance of hitting 1
is only 10%.

Yes, random numbers will streak.

And NOBODY said that your fail rate on metal bits is 1% at "high 30's"
skill. I used 1% as an example.
