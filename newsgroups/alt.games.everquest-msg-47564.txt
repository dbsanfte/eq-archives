I would choose:

Druid Shaman Rogue Warrior

If I had to drop one of those I would drop the rogue and drop a monk in.

Between the casters you wouls have healing sowing porting and  buffing out 
the wazoo. For a small group, Wizards are too specific to have much 
flexibility, so the druid is necessary if you want ports. If you wanted to 
replace the shaman do it with a chanter. Breeze or clarity makes the druid 
a better healer, and speeding up the musclebound types, on top of druid str 
buffs and damage shields, would make short work of most yellow mobs.
