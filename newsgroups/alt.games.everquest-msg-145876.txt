    Answer: very slowly.

    There's more exact analysis on Graffe's and Monkly Business, but this is
the upshot. At level 60, the XP from things level 46 or less is about half
what it was before. Things in the 47 to 49 range are at two-thirds XP. 51 is
the breakeven point - same XP now as before. The XP then scales up quite
dramatically. The top XP seems to have a three times or so modifier to it,
based on experiments a guildmate did on a soloable level 70 mob (don't ask).
I would GUESS, but cannot confirm, that these level ranges scale down to
level 51 characters. So at level 51, you'd want to be killing level 42+ mobs
to get good XP (they did say the changes would be to level 51 and up
characters, not just the mobs).

    Combined with other changes, it's really made clerics look like a
"favoured class". Here's hoping the backlash isn't too bad against us. =/
