Enchanter, shaman. (haste, slow, pet, maybe clarity). Save yourself healing
by letting the pet tank a bit, they regen really fast.
Cleric would work to, but not as well. Without slow youll be using a lot of
mana to heal, and cleric doesnt contribute much (any?) dps. Druid is even
more of a problem for mana, but might work with downtime.
Bard,necro and SK would work, in the sense that they can fear kite things
and you can just be dps. Ditto ranger if you hunt animals.

so...


Good: enchanter shaman
Medium: Cleric, Bard, necro, SK
not so great: Druid
