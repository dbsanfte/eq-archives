Ooooooh. Earth pet, I choose you! I have mastered aggro management!

Still. When grouping with only-soloed-before mages, group-friendly
aggro management is often less of a problem (in my experience) than for
beastlords or wizards. But you can tell the difference in other ways.
Sending the pet to intercept the mob on the pull, instead of letting the
puller drag it all the way to the tank's lap. They never bought Summon
Arrows/Shuriken/DotFocusBracer/etc. They use earth pet (or worse, fire
pet) all the time.

[the mages who group exclusively, OTOH, seem to never have bought Summon
Bandages. oh well]

No, what we're trying to say is that being an expert in soloing doesn't
make you an expert in grouping, any more than it makes you an expert in
raiding. They're similar. Many skills transfer over. Many skills *don't*.
