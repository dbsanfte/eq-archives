These quests are a pain in the ass. My Vah Shir shaman spent a large
percentage of his 30s and 40s hunting in these zones, collecting all 
those quest parts. The result: not a single damn item, for shaman 
or otherwise -- just a few dozen mismatched quest items. There is 
virtually no market for the quest parts, either.

The armor is pretty mediocre as well. There were one or two pieces
which I would have worn at the time.
