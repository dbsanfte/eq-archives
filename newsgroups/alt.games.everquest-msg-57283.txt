EQW  sounds like your only fix.  Either that or go (back) to paying out the
ying yang.

Though VI doesn't seem to like it (what DONT they like) it's really the only
choice for people such as yourself.

So, the chance of using it I leave to you.

BTW.  I've looked into this program extensively and cannot find any network
calls or otherwise being used to send ANY information to anything via the
web... however, that is not to say I didn't miss something.  If I didn't
have 2+ computers, I would use it myself actually.  I consider it an
"enhancement" to Windows. <grin>
