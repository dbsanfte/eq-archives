Yeah, I've been on tonight.  Not a happy thing.

This really, really makes it hard to raid.  I don't own a non-proccing 
weapon.  Hell, I don't own a weapon that doesn't proc once a fight.  At 
least you can clear it by clicking an illusion mask.  With my mask 
hotkeyed, I can almost keep 2 songs up.  
I hear rumors that it will be addressed in tonight's emergancy patch.  I 
really hope so.
