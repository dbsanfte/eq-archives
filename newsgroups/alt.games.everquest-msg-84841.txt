We use a SBLive on our 900 mhz Athlon machine with no problems.  Sound cards
can be an issue. I have a Philips on another machine and it works fine as
well.  It was on a PIII machine. Random freezes could be heat as well, EQ
does push the graphics which increases heat.  Of course I originally bought
the SBLive since our on board audio was causing a problem. To make sure,
disable the sound card and play. If it still freezes, likely heat if not get
a Philips very cheap but good.
