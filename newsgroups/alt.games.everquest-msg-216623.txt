I have noticed that as time goes on the quests are getting harder. This is a
trend accross all the quests . Slaughter 55 has gone up to slaughter 65 .
Collect 20 may now be collect 25 .

If you had a hard time at the start you may be suffering now. What used to
take 40 minutes is now taking 50 , still well within the time allowed.

What I dont know is whether it was designed to be self regulating towards
harder or whether they are playing with it in progress. Could easily be
either.
