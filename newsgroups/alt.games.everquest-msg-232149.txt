There are far more options than that, my friend.  It's just that most people
in the US (don't know about other comparable countries) only want to do
white-collar work.  Which is why a skilled mechanic - even an honest one -
can skin your white-collar worker alive when he comes in to get his
transmission rebuilt.

In a way, though, that's the market correcting itself.  Since fewer kids are
willing to become blue-collar workers; skilled, reliable laborers are
becoming more and more scarce, and employers are having to pay more to keep
them.







Rise up, my blue-collar brethern!
