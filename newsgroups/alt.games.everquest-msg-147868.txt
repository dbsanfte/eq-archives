It's not an exploit; it's just unintended consequences.

An exploit is something that takes advantage of a flaw
in the game and/or zone.  A pathing bug, for instance,
that allows you to kill a mob without any risk because
it can't attack you would be an exploit.  Moving someone
through a wall or a /camp trick, like the way some people
moved across Siren's Grotto, would be an exploit.

This is just using the spells in an unintended manner.
It's like Feign Death:  the designers didn't foresee the
way it'd be used to split mobs when pulling.  Using it to
do so isn't an exploit; it's tactics.  Same thing here...

If they wanted to make people go through the content, they
could do so fairly simply.  All they'd have to do is boot
anyone off an island if they didn't have a key...
