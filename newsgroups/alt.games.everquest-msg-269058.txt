Yeah that's a fucking brilliant solution, you must work for Nasa!

....You need to learn more about the system, and EQ2.... Low level members
become high level members, it's unavoidable.... You cant stop the dings....
Within a week or two patrons are level 15.. then 20..... then their bitching
about having to kill grey cons, and we're back where we started.... So now
what? Take off their patron flags and give them to the next lowest members?
Nice try... If you know -anything- about this system you know why that wont
work...
