OK, so I finally got on after turn it on-leave it on for the patcher
overnight

Its so unbelievably choppy that its pretty much unplayable

With the game options on Dragon Raid settings (everything off, clip
plane minimum) I was able to wander around, but sure wouldn't have
wanted to fight anything.

Then I got a bright idea:  I went in and turned the textures down to
low, all character models off... hey, now it works nice and smooth.

Course its not the shiny new game engine I've paid for...but heck, at
least I can play.

Before anyone comments on memory or CPU speed, thats with 384MB of
memory, a 32meg graphics card, and a 1.6 gig CPU P4.  OK, so its not an
uber machine, but its sure as Brell well over their specs.
