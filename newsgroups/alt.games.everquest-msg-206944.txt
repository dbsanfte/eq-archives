Not sure off hand on that, someone gave me a Larktwitter I think, 
somethign like that.  I'm sure there are better available for a twink.

The weight reduction that the quiver shows is also the haste it provides.  
I believe that the Fleeting Quiver is the best player made one, maybe 
best in game, don't know for certain.

All I can say is that rangers always go for as much ATK buff as they can 
get, whether meleeing or using archery.

The most uber ranger I personally fight with does not ask for or want the 
Agility buff.  It raises AC, but his is likely at cap anyway, and it 
takes up a buff slot that could be used for something more important.  
One reason they may not care if the haste is 70% is that they have a 40% 
plus haste item, cap is 100% between spell and item, so why take 70 when 
you can have 60+stats and still be at cap?

I don't believe so.

No clue.

No clue, except that they always want the mob not touching a wall, as 
archery misses 100% of the time when a mob is touching a wall, or so I am 
told.

Depends what you are up against.  I see rangers tank up to 65, just 
depends on the mobs.  For that matter, I have gone to PoV and done the 
wall camps with a 65 rogue as the MA any number of times.

You mean the map window?  I would be very surprised.
