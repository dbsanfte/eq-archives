You set yourself up on autorun across Dreadlands (been a long time for me,
but I still remember it being a hard run at the appropriate level) and
instead of outrunning stuff that you aggro, you get beat to death at 10 fps.

You autofollow someone in a raid/group at low FPS and get killed, lost, or
(I've seen it happen, hell I've caused it) wipe the raid by veering off at
odd angles and rubber-banding back to the raid with aggro.

I picked specific things where 10 or 20 fps would most likely not "work
fine".

EQPN's "sleep" function is the big CPU help.  The difference in CPU usage of
a 10 FPS change isn't remarkable (as shown in their own info).  The
rendering thingy is a neat trick, and can really impact CPU usage.
