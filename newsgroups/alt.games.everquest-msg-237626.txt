Humm!

I to got your last one last night for the first time. I was in PoK when 
all of a sudden the Lag meter would got to around 95% out and 95% in and 
stay like that until I camped. It was weird I could run around but not 
interact with anything in world. I /camp 3 times but each time the lag 
jumped after a few minutes. The modem lights were threatening to burn 
out.

Eventually I /camp desktop. The Internet and email worked fine, until I 
went to shut down then Rnapp refused to close and I had to do a 
Ctrl+alt+delete to close down.

I rebooted and started EQ again and the problem reoccurred.

Because the fact that the modem lights were on full I suspected an 
infection but my machine was clear.

So I risked it and ran with my firewall up. The log record shows that 
the light activity was all EQ related. Multiple resends from both my end 
and the server.

I haven't got a packet capture programme and my old abacus couldn't run 
one and EQ. But I am suspecting a router somewhere on route was 
corrupting the data causing both end to keep asking for resends.

Also I haven't seen a repeat tonight. So I am guessing it was a net in 
general problem and it's been fixed (Fingers crossed)
