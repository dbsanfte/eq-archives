...and they have done this with movie trailers. Did you have a problem
with movies making a big deal out of the fact that they were going to
be the first to run the trailers for SW EP1 and EP2 back at those
times? As I said before, I had a friend that worked at a theater. He
said that there were tons of people who paid the $8 to get in, watched
the trailer, then left right after.

If people want to pay that much for something they don't want just to
get the promo, that's their business. It would be stupid of a company
not to take advantage of someone's willingness to do that...
