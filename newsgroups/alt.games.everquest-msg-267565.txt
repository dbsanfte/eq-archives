    I'm on the side of "Nay", though I don't have terribly strong feelings
about it.

    I think it is likely that talk of EQ2 will die down the same way that
talk of CoH did.  The CoH newsgroup is now a low traffic group.  I think
that anytime a new game comes along there is going to be alot of talk about
it, then it will trail off. 

   Of course, this might be a different situation.  Many think that EQL is
on its downward slope, and that EQ2 will take its place.  I dunno if I
believe that or not, I'm not terribly impressed with EQ2 as of yet.  And I
do agree that EQ2 is an aspect of EQL and thus belongs in this groups. 
Plus, well, I like the community here for the most part, and I don't think
that an attempt to split it going to do much good.

   But then, since I don't play EQL anymore, so I'm pretty much not
inclined to be affected by the "off topic" EQ2 posting.  I can see how this
whole EQ2 situation could be mighty annoying to the EQL folks.  It doesn't
help that I don't really see this as a "Them Vrs Us" situation, since for
so long, and until recently, the "Thems and Us's" were part of the exact
same crowd.
