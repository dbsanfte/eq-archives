That's speculation.

It's not as though the person in question is standing in a spot where
the orcs *cannot* get to him - that would clearly be an exploit. What
is actually happening, instead, is that the orcs are running to the
bridge instead of jumping in the water.

I would be very very surprised if that were the case, especially since
people have been using this tactic since the game was released, and
I've never heard of anyone being warned over it.
