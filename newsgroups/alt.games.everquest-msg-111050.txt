I have been told that you can exercise skills like Sense heading, or
Foraging by binding the skill to a specific key. A friend of mine has told
me that he has got sense heading, AND turn left  bound to the Left Arrow
key. I would like to do somthing similar, however I can find ZERO
documentation on how to do this.

If anyone could shed any light on this Id be HUGELY grateful :)
