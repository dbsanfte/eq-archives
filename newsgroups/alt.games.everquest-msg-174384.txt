My guild was already bleeding out before PoP - PoP just exacerbated (sp?)
the problem.  The guild imploded about a month ago and no longer exists,
at the same time some of my RL friends had increased RL time committments
(my buddy got full custody of his son, stuff like that).  Add to that the
fact that I played for a lot of hours in the Tier one zones (start of 59
nearly through 61 with a few aa) with only 3 parchments to show for it, and
no spells I actually need (Magicians got screwed - 18 trade in spells for
61/62 - makes getting useful ones like the 61 pet much harder) and I've
been on a bit of a hiatus.  Wrestling with whether or not to come back
to my 61 mage, or start another character or cancel.  I've taken breaks 
like this before, and my interest was renewed by the time off - so it's 
hard to say.
