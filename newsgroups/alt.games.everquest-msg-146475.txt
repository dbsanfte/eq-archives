Been there, had that done. (Soandso tells you, "I have the whole Warrens
camped. You can just leave now and save yourself some frustration. If you
attack anything I'll report you for KSing.")

Turns out it was a guild trying to get the WHOLE GUILD enough faction to buy
their own Hole keys in Paineel.

But yes, tell the pally that you would like a few spawns, and if he doesn't
like it he can petition that you are taking 3-4 of a couple dozen mobs. I've
seen guides kick high levels out of a zone because they xp wasn't good for
them, and the item they were trying to camp the zone for they could just as
easily BUY after three hours in a good high level xp/money zone.
