Warders protection is "ok" without the stacking bugs - it still stacks with
natures precision and FoN or wolf naturally.

It sucks as a 60 spell when compared to the alternatives, especially as its
self only, but its "ok", and still a nice boost in raid situations where you're
short on buff slots.

It only becomes "good" with the bugs though. If they fix them, and dont upgrade
it, I hope they make it castable on others or.... hohum. who cares?
