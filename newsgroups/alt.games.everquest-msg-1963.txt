I feel that it's not fair to make the game harder for the newer/casual
players than it was for the older players at those same levels. 
Removing multiquesting would make some quests more difficult than they
were before.

/agree ... many quests were designed by people who expected
multiquesting to be a feature of the game, I'm guessing.

Certainly it's not fair to change the way the votes are counted during
the election.
