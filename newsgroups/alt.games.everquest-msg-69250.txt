Speaking of good hits with no bad
   if you give the derv ear rings to the named orc in "Southern Desert of
Ro" the in the (MW of the zone) the name is Ortallius or Rathmana this will
give you good hits from Paladin Guilds. Just so know the guards in NFP are
Paladin and HATE the guards in EFP and WFP. So giveing the orc belt to the
guards in WFP you take Bad hits with the Guards in NFP. and giveing the
belts to the Paladin Guild in NFP will give you bad hits in E&WFP.
