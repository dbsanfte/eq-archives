This news is from Blizzard:
The World of Warcraft Class Panel was the second major panel of the
day, and included both  Tom Chilton-Lead Designer，and Greg Street-Lead
Class Systems Designer.
Greg Street took the microphone for most of it, as he's become known
as one of the more vocal developers on the Wrath of the Lich King beta
forums under the nickname Ghostcrawler.
Now we know why:  Ghostcrawler is the Lead Class Systems Designer for
World of Warcraft, and is one of the people responsible for many of
the positive gameplay changes you're seeing in the expansion for
classes.

No one knows the destiny of all the classes in the Wotlk, let’s see
what will happened in the 13rd Nov. check: http://www.thecheapwowgold.com
