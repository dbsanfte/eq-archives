I (as a shaman) was grouping with an iksar monk quite regularly from levels
10 through 20.  Helping him out with melee certainly slowed things down and
I learned quickly that it was much more efficient to buff him, debuff mobs,
and heal him.

When I would try to help him with melee it would; 1- cause more downtime
than necessary because he'd have to stop pulling to let me med for heals to
keep him alive, or 2- We would both end up dying because we would get an add
or a particularly strong mob and I didn't have the mana for all the heals
necessary because I'd been swinging a spear instead of medding.

Yes, its true that at level 12 most classes can still melee fairly well, but
that doesn't mean they should.  Especially in this case where the shaman
would be more effective in using his spells as opposed to swinging his
weapon.
