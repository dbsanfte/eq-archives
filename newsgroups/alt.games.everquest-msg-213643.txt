I can't remember which level you get your improved charm song, but you'll
have to twist the first one with something to keep from getting toasted.
With the next one, you can charm one, the when it breaks, charm the other,
and hopefully have two mobs that can be easily killed.  Play real
aggressively but make sure ae fear and selos is up, heh...
