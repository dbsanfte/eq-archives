As I understand it a failed skill check is less likely to get you a
success than a success. This means at lower skill for any particular
difficulty of skill you over time are going to advance slower.
Weaponskills go up fast because they get used a lot. Taunt is slower. Like
sense heading you should eventually notice it picking up, mine on my
ranger went very slow till about 50 by which time it was noticeably
faster.

Sort of though by a different paradigm. Tradeskills block you getting
skill ups on simple items by having the trivial level where it becomes
simple enough that you can learn no more. Weaponskills etc are limited by
requiring you to to be fighting monsters that gain you xp to get skill ups
Spells if anything works the other way round....every spell has a fizzle
chance and if it fails I dont think you can gain skill ups in that field.
However if you cast enough easy spells your skill will increase to a level
where the hard spells with higher fizzle rates become easy to cast.

Taunt seems to me to be a fixed chance skill based on your taunt stat - so
Id assume it doesnt have this need more difficult target to gain skill
ups. However to be honest I havent investigated this hugely and my ranger
is now capped out on taunt anyway - so if someone turns round and tells e
how the difficulty for taunt to work scale i set up then Ill beleive em
