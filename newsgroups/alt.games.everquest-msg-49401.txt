Not really an answer to your question, but if you are going for a server
transfer I would wait till the european servers are release. VI said
that they were making these and entered an agreement with telewest to
host them. With luck they will alow transfers on to some of these faster
than normal. 

Unfortunatly I don't think that there is any information on when they
are going to come up.

HTH,

Jim
