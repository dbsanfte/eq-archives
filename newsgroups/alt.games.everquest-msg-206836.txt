Lance, I wanted to thank you for your math lesson and ask a few more things.

I've always been a little confused about the exp itself but I think I have a
clearer picture based on your postings.  Feel free to correct me where i'm
wrong.

A mob gives out "x" experience "points" no matter who kills it, right?  If
it cons yellow to you and blue to me and we each kill one, we would each get
the same number of "points", the points would just mean a little less to me
than you based on our respective levels.

And if we were grouped (and still different levels), we would split 120% of
these "points", with my share being larger than yours based on a straight
ratio of our levels.

Just for example, a level 40 and a level 20 walk into a bar and kill the
bartender (assuming the lv40 gets exp for the kill), they would get 80% and
40% respectively.

But, for my big question, if we were grouped and killed a mob that was blue
to you and green to me, would you again get a percentage based on the ratio
of our levels while I would get nothing?

Again for example, the same lv40 and lv20 kill a different bartender who is
green to the lv40, does the lv20 get 40% while the lv40 gets nothing?

Thanks.

Clayton
