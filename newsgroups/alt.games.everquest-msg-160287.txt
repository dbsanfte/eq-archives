    Thank you, but this isn't a case of my not being familar with the
commands.  This is a (frequent) case of my having to conversations at
once, and typing so fast that I just put the opening command in pretty
much at random.  I do this with /r, /1, /gu, and /gsay pretty much all
the time.  Keeps me honest.

   I think the worst example of this was at a guild meet last month,
when we almost imploded.  I was having a conversation with one of the
soon to be defectors, whom I was thinking of joining.  In the middle of
a long session of very carefully chosen words on both sides, I suddenly
chime into open chat with 

"Well, if I leave, Lenny will too.  You make three, Jaya makes 4, and I
see some other unhappy people here tonight as well.  Might even have
enough to form a guild."

There was stunned silence for a second, then a flurry of words.  What
could I say but "Sorry, guys. I meant to plot that BEHIND your backs?"
