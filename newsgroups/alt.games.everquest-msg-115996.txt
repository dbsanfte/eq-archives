why are they?  Would they still be assholes if the reavers were given away
free?  Or if their guildies/mom/twink needed one to finish their epic?

Does the same apply if 3 people are doing kael arena?  After all, thats a
"raid" zone too.

With me botting 3 chars (60 monk, 60 cleric, 60 shaman) I can kill any mob
inside the arena (except Vindi obviously).

Why would I?  My girlfriend needed a plate bp... my mage/wiz would like some
silk pieces.. it was much needed faction after several weeks of pharming
SS/ntov..  it was also my choice of exp zone to get away from other dipshits
(any place another group can pull near to you I have no time for anymore)

If I wanted to get the arena, I had to get there early.  If an asian guild
was doing arena (as they often do) then tough shit for me.  If I beat them,
well tough shit for them - i was there first.

Or are you refering to the selling of epic pieces?  Like the chanter who
made me pay over 10k for my chardok pipe (and the only way i could afford
it, was selling my fungi).    And no, my twinks aren't dressed in thousends
of pp in gear (virtually all of my wiz and magis gear is what I spent weeks
pharming for in SS)

If I liked CoM.. found the reavers a good exp camp (with the possibility to
reward random_druid_friend with a jade reaver) and didn't hate being
blinded, I would go exp there.. and whoever bitched at me, would be told to
kiss my ass.
