IMO grouping shouldn't be required but there are a number of options
out there and you take your pick based on what you like.  The fact that
WoW doesn't require grouping is bad if you really like to group.  It's
good for me though as I like to solo a lot and as a minimum requirement
I need to be able to solo whilst looking for a group (and for me to
feel that I'm achieving something - I didn't get that feeling in EQ2)

This is, probably, my biggest gripe with WoW and EQ2.  I just don't
feel that death is penalised enough.  With EQ I fealt a big thrill when
I narrowly avoided death - I never got that feeling from EQ2 or WoW.  I
think that this is due to the fact that you don't lose experience in
either of them (experience debt didn't have the same impact for me).  I
also think that the fact that you reappeared at your bind point with no
gear and then had to overcome the difficulty of getting it back also
added to the thrill of a near miss.  In WoW, sometimes the easiest way
to overcome a problem is to die and I have seen posts recommending it
as a tactic.  I just don't think that is a good thing.  In EQ I would
never have even contemplated doing something that resulted in certain
death even if it did put me nearer my goal.
