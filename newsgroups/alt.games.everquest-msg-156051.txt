Nope thats why i was so eager to test Statue..  its damage from the front
(and you cant avoid the hits)

Its not about tanking, its about having the ability to pull mobs like monks
have been for the last 3+ years
Its about being able to take melee damage better than a dress wearing caster

You still get hit a LOT when pulling.

Thats fine, how about at least give us defensive abilities to get the mob TO
the plate wearing tagger?

Its not just about being good at monking, im sure the best chanter in the
game would still be great if he had a capped HP of 1000, but he would sure
die a lot more, thus end up being less effective.
