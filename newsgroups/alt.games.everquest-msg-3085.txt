Yes.  It's hitting most players.  There was 20% packet loss for a long
time, with the Verant GMs in chat saying the usual "it's your ISP".
Finally, when we started calling out our locations and connections, so
they could see it really was from all around the world on a variety of
connections, they said, "we're looking into it".

Now it is taking a long time to get to the server screen, and if you
select a server, you get a message that it is not responding, and get
booted out.  In chat, there are a bunch of general chat rooms full of
annoyed people, and Verant just took down the "All servers are up!!!"
banner that was drawing a lot of ridicule.

Meanwhile, over on the network status page at www.everquest.com, all is
normal: the patch completed a couple days ago and all servers are
running.

The good news is the packet loss seems to be gone.  Pinging assorted
world servers is given 0% packet loss now, whereas it was giving about
20% earlier.
