I would like to transfer one of my characters from my main account to
the newly aquiered account. I updated all the expansions on both
accounts. Did my app on EQ's website and a few days later got a reply
from Customer service telling em that it can't be done. The reason is
that I was not the original owner of the new account. I sent them a
reply informing them that it was my friends and I had all the
information they needed. even my friend said he would e-mail them and
give thme any information needed to make this happen but still
couldn't get it done.

Fix your line breaks first of all.

Now then, first thing you should know is that transfer of ownership of
accounts violates the EULA. As such, SOE will do nothing to support
such an action, and that includes transferring a character to an
account you weren't the original owner of. It's not likely they'll ban
you for it, but there is no way to do what you want. Your SOL there.
