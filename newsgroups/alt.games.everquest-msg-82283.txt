That would depend on Server (Older servers with more ppl buying/selling,
younger server with more ppl needing etc) demand (How many other ppl are
farming the skins? and how many ppl are buying those skins) luck (finding
the ppl to buy is sometimes time consuming. part of building a success is
getting return customers)

I know that on Tarrew Marr the price can vary a bit. During evening hours
(Us time) The server count puts Tarrew marr at or near the top of the
'Population' list. When I wake up in the morning normally it's near the
bottom of the list. So on my server it would probably be easier to find
someone at evening. but also there are most likely gonna be more ppl selling
so prices will probably be lower. at night/morning when most of ppl are
work/school prices will inch up as the suppliers will be harder to find and
more likely to be able to set their own price on what they sell. etc etc.

I know HQ Bear Skins sell for 30-40pp per on my server. HQ Cat skins...
maybe 1-5pp per skin is a rough guestamate...  I've never done
buying/selling personally but I do know a couple good friends who do
buy/sell (Got a couple in guild workin on tailoring for Shawl quests for
example... gonna need to do myself soon hehe :) I'll ask tonight and find
out prices on HQ Cat Hides for Tarrew Marr.

What server are you playing on? time of day? Anyone know the prices for that
server?
