I can't be bothered to flame as that is likely all your post is meant to
achieve and you already know how well you are thought of here.
In case you are serious tho' here's some advise;
No one is going to do this and if they say they are for $400 then they are
either BS'ing you  or haven't a clue what you are asking.
A character with those items would sell for more than $400 dollars, I
suggest, if you are serious,  try offering a grand for these items or look
for a character with something similar, if you have money to burn then
changing your name isn't that hard and with an abundance of spare cash that
you say you have it shouldn't be a problem, personally I think you are
trolling because no one can be that stupid as think they need this sort of
equipment at level 1 (you haven't stated a server so you must just be
creating a character on that server) to enjoy the game.

Oh, btw, there are only a select few that post here of the sort of levels
that would be required to get in the raids to achieve this and I can't see
any of them here helping you, try elsewhere.
