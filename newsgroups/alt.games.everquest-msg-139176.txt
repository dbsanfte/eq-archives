To really kick things off..

If you say that you are a thief if you find money on the street.. i think
you are a tad off..
Finding a wallet is somewhat another matter.. IF that wallet has some kind
of way to find the person owning it.. (drivers licence.. or similar), you
should feel guilty for keeping whatever of value in it.. IF you find
something of value at e.g. a trainstation.. You give it to "lost and found"
at the trainstation.. There is no such thing at all in EQ.

So.. Lets say that your mom wanted you to give her back the 100$ you
borrowed from her last week.. Oki you say.. but i am at the mall right now
and got to go.. Your mom says.. Just leave it on the corner at the
entrance.. ill come by and pick it up in 10 minutes..
Think about it.. Would you really leave the money? And if you did.. and
someone took it.. would you say to everyone that someone "stole" 100$ from
you??

Be real!! If you are so insanely stupid to drop-trade items worth 12K in the
BAZAAR with 300+ peeps in there.. would you really expect to find it at all
when your alt is logged back in? I think not..

Would i have stood around a bit.. checking if someone asked about it? Yes i
would.. would i shout that i found a bag of gear.. come get it whoever lost
it? No i would not..
Would i ever drop-trade at a place with so many peeps.. ever? No i would
not..
