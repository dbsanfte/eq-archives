I breezed thru all the replies & didnt see the following suggestion...
this is what I had to do to get EQ to run on my wifes machine.   You prolly
already tried it...  you seem to be knowledgable.  Maybe not exactly like
this though.

Download or have rdy:

DX8.1
Nvidea's XP drivers
Latest sound drivers.

Install them in THAT ORDER.   Try EQ.   If that dont work, disable the
onboard sound & try it.  If you find that EQ seems to crash less with the
sound disabled, disable the sound in EQ, or go buy a SB 128 OEM for 24 bucks
& try that.   Seems that most crashes in EQ appear to be sound related.
