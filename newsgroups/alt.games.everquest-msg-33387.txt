*jaw drops*
*cries and tries to steal boots*

Get a shroud of nature for chest (3-4k on my server), black alloy
medallion for neck (500-1.5k)
Any other upgrades would be in the truly uber realm and probably not
attainable until you're 50+ 

*sniffles and hires a rogue to pickpocket Hiper*

Oh, I forgot one thing... coldain skin gloves for around 10k.
