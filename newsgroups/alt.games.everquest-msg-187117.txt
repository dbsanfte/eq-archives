Should have been more specific... He received *all* the items off a
character that was reported hacked. The situation was that the
original owner had quit and given the account to a friend. Eventually,
the guy decided he wanted to play again, so the friend handed off all
the stuff on a character that he had earned to my guildie to hold and
transfer. Few days later, the original owner logged in (after getting
the account back, changing the PW, and seeing everything was okay) to
find that all his characters had been stripped completely. He reported
it hacked, and got an email back that the "responsible parties" had
been dealt with. Since my guildie had received the whole
kit-n-kaboodle from one of the characters on the account so recently,
this was seen as evidence that he was involved in the hacking.
