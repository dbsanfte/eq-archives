I would totally agree with you, except for the fact that he used an insider 
character in the Dwarf guild. Disrupting the wedding was cool as all hell, 
and good tactics, and I have no problem with that; but using a traitor (and 
a fucking **paladin** of all things) for the purpose is pretty damn 
dishonorable, if you ask me.

If I had belonged to that guild, and heard of the plans, it would have been 
a case of an immediate /guildremove.
