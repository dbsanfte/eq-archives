A player guild (which is what I assume you mean) is just a collection
of players generally with a common goal.  As a member of a guild, you
get another communication channel (/guildsay) to talk to all your
guildmates.  To join one, you get an officer in the guild to invite you
(/guildinvite).  To do that, you make friends with people in that
guild, make sure you agree with their philosophy, and convince them
that you'd be a worthwhile addition to their guild.

As for levels - well, guilds are player-run, so level requirements are
entirely up to the players in that guild.  Guild philosophies and goals
are also entirely up to players: some guilds are just a bunch of
friends who want to play together, others are uber-guilds who kill the
toughest mobs in the game (but don't expect to join any of those at
level 7 :-)

Don't sweat it at level 7 - go out and meet people and remember those
you get on well with.  If they're guilded and their guild looks really
good, get to know them better by hunting with them more.  Sooner or
later you'll find a good guild if you really want to.

As a druid, all of your spells can be purchased in various locations
around Norrath.  Don't worry, your spell book has plenty of room.  The
meditate button is an artifact from earlier times - you used to have to
press it to meditate, but it automatically activates now as soon as you
get the skill (at level 8).  Yes, you will regen mana quicker.

Spells each belong to one of the above schools.  Specialisation in a
school slightly reduces the mana cost for all spells in that school.
Not sure what the best course is for a druid, I mostly play a cleric
(where Alteration is the best course, for healing spells).

Halfling tailoring - requires a fairly high skill.  Selling them to
players is a good idea unless you're planning to take up the skill, and
it'll be a while before you're good enough to make Vale Armour.

I can only think of one quest offhand where they're needed and it's
not a very high level one.  Maybe there are others.

Fishing is good when you're low level, certainly, if time isn't at a
premium.  Later on it's more of a diversion than a seriously useful
skill (although a few quests need "special" catches, I believe).

Pretty much, yes.  You can also make bandages with them.  You'll find
that later on, spider silk is much more sought after for making various
kinds of silk armour.

Tailoring is one of the toughest skills to raise since so many of the
components needed drop from mobs (rather than being easily bought at a
vendor) - as a druid though, you will have an advantage when you get
the Tracking skill.  Some very desirable equipment can be tailored at
high skill levels.  If you do decide to take it up, doing so at a low
level is a good idea - that way you can also get XP from the mobs you
kill for the materials (cats, wolves, spiders primarily).

Can't remember :)  101 and above is Master.
