Excellent point... I *really* wish that I couldn't cast harmful spells on
myself. THANK GOD they recently changed the druid AOE lightning spell icon
to GREEN(AOE color go figure) from RED... When it was red, it looked EXACTLY
like SoE.

Snare(offensive) and SoW(buff) share the same icon also... not such a big
deal most of the time since I know where I keep my SoW and SoE, but once I
move them to hotkeys, anything goes :)

Shield of Thorns (buff) has same icon as Root(offensive)... not good there
either :)

Maybe we should ask them to change player buffs to a different color from
offensive spells.
