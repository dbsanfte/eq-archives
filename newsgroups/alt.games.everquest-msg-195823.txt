My point was totally lost on you.

Re-read the first sentence you quoted, followed by the second, and process
them through the filter of the author (myself) being around when staring at
the book was required (i.e., a member of the old folks home).

Okay, never mind.  I'll draw a map.

The point is that only the folks who have been around since the requisite
was staring at the book for 35 levels will have the patience for the
increased amount of time spent dying and retrieving corpses.

Remember, back then you had to retrieve every corpse, even at lvl 1, if you
wanted your stuff back.  For the most part, the folks who have started
playing the game since the change you so deftly alluded to in your witty
response are more into instant gratification mode, and will flock back to
their home servers when the going gets tough.

The ones who stick around and tough it out are the wheat ... all others are
the chaff.

Unless, of course, it turns into the type of dick-waving bitchfest Kaev
describes Lanys had become.  Then all bets are off .....
