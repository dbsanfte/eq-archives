Look for these:

HidePlayerWin=FALSE
HidePartyWin=FALSE
HideTargetWin=FALSE
HideSpellsWin=FALSE
HideBuffWin=FALSE
HideHotboxWin=FALSE
HideChatWin=FALSE
HideMainMenuWin=FALSE

Also, you can "lock" the windows so you can't resize or move them- use alt-l

Other fun EQClient hacks-

Log=TRUE

Logging always on, handy

ServerFilter=1

VERY good thing to have on, when you filter stuff (like auctions or 
whatever you have blocked in the Options window) this makes it block at the 
server, instead of your machine... IE you are not choking your pipeline with info you are never going to see anyway.

RunMode=TRUE

Always have run on when you start. Also handy.

You can also find another .ini file in the same directory- 
charactername_##.ini, where ## is a number relating to what server that 
character lives on(I think).

This file holds interesting things, namely your Friends and Ignore lists. 
This makes it easy to make sure you have a healthy list of buddies on all of your 
characters :)
