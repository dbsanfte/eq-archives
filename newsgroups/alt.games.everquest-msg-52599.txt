my first character was a druid . I soloed levels 49 and 50 using the ogre
bouncers . I could keep one bouncer cleared. A necro , mage , shaman ,
enchanter could not only keep both clear they will be sitting on there ass
80% of the time and not even medding while doing it . Its just stiupid silly
how much easier those classes are to solo then a druid is .

For another example go to the icegiants outside perma . see who does better
.

For another example go to the ocwan of tears and count mobs . Hell I catch
necros and shamans here all the time soloing seafuries that are green for
cash not exps.

There arent any more necros anymore precisely because they all leveld to 60
in 2 weeks in skyfire then decided they had won and quit :)
