There are a couple reasons the Wurmslayer is sometimes considered less
than Uber.

The main one is the weight, which eats your Stamina fast. If you group
with someone who can fix this, it's not really an issue. Just mention
before hand that the weapon is a stamina hog and ask them to memorize
a sta restore. It is not often an issue, unless you are fighting
multiple mobs at once.

It has a long delay, so it isn't as effective a taunt as a much
quicker weapon. This is true, however the high damage output means you
get well up the mob's hate list. It is very rare for a primary tank
with a Wurmslayer to lose a mob's aggro. In addition, the high delay
means less level damage bonuses, so overall damage isn't as high as
the ratio indicates. It is still higher than most weapons around
though.

The plus of the Wurmslayer (huge damage) more than outweighs the
minuses. It really is one of the best 1hs weapons around, short of
planar/named dragon drops. If your guild is willing to help you get
one, you should go for it.
