Except, they haven't. Its all negative. Its things that dont spawn
any more.

Vox and Naggie wail with orgasmic glee that they can consumate their
union and breed another kerafyrm... but dont.

Kerafyrm screams he will purge the world of Dragonkind.... and it
repops and he is never heard from again.

This is why people get pissed at waking the sleeper; theres 10 minutes
of scripted giggles and then its a PITA for everyone. Now, if the
script did what it implied, and permanently, for example, changed
SolB and Perma into *real* high level zones as Naggie and Vox ascended,
stuff like that, that WOULD be good.

I.e....

"This server is ripe! Mature enough to keel sleeper! Activate transition
from mid-level targetted content to high level-content!"

I am SO not commenting on this one.

Pffft. More easily more shmeesily. Drop rates plummet.

Agreed. And I'd MUCH rather verant started hooking "dungeon transitions"
in in the manner I described above; dont make Cazic Thule high level on
all servers; new servers still need lowbie content. Hook it in to defining
server events and make the players actions *matter* to the world
at large.
