Icetooth claws might fit the bill 11/29 or maybe a Black Alloy Long Sword
10/29 sv poison. both of those a very reasonable or you could go to runnyeye
for the Black Alloy. Another consideration would be the Walrus Tooth 6/22
with 3str 3dex (I think been a while since I have seen one). You will find
most if not all 1hs with 10dam and a low to reasonable delay weapons with
stats will be on the expensive side and a little out of your reach to camp
with your current group.
