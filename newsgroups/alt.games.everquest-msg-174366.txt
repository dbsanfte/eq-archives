If you want proof, you just have to look at the news or at Wal Mart's
advertising.  Look at the article David Sparks referred to in his post, 
search any news site for articles on Wal Mart and censorship, or listen
to the Wal Mart ads on Paul Harvey's radio show where they brag about
not selling any games, videos, or music CDs with excessive violence,
nudity, or bad language. Their ads brag about the fact that they are so
big and powerful that they can "force" publishers to edit their products
or Wal Mart won't sell them.

This is from Wal Mart's web site:

"Wal-Mart restricts the sale of "mature-rated" video games to customers
17 years of age and older. We also have taken measures to exclude
mature-rated games that are sexually explicit or overly violent."

In other words, they tell the publishers that they have to either offer
edited versions of their products or Wal Mart won't sell them.  Buy a
mature rated movie or album from them, and you'll find out.  The nude
scenes are clipped, the language is bleeped or changed, and the most
violent scenes are edited in the same way they would be for showing on
network TV.
