You need cure poison potions to get rid of ebolt, which is part of why
its so nasty. Not to mention it does all its damage very very fast.

Part of the reason I picked a necro is because I hate relying on other
people to keep me alive. Each to their own though, some people love
grouping and killing stuff in dungeons and all that, which is fair
enough because imo, eq is what you make of it yourself.

Aye. If I'm medding and I get double backstabbed without the disc I will
be left on 350hp (based on my friend's 58 rogue bs'ing me for 650+ once
when I was medding).

Keep in mind that rogues get owned fairly hard for most of their lives
though. Its really only in the high 50's that they start to become
ridiculously powerful.

A lot of the time I don't know that initially. I was having a fight in
sro with a 54 wiz who actually knew what he was doing (used lures after
he realized IC didn't do any damage, clicked off all his buffs then
dispelled splurt and ignite blood after I filled his dot slot, kept
recasting manaskin to stop me from getting hp back from lifetaps), was
very fun until a druid decided to lay winged death on me, which combined
with the fact I was getting nuked for a little over 400 every 4 seconds
was taking a serious dent out of my hp. I bailed at that point
(shadowstep -> gate).

This is always something I wondered. I have always been under the
impression that dot's last 2/3's on ALL pc's because that is how VI
decided to nerf dot's to 66%.

However I have killed people with just 1 cast of splurt. I was plvl'ing
a friends bard in OT, saw a full health mage with pet up so I rooted the
pet, splurted the mage and he gated to his bind point in zone. So I
waited, and waited, and waited....and on the last tick I got the slain
message. That particular mage learnt to dispell dots in every fight I've
seen him in since :p

You'll want to use real low delay weaps though. Sk's and paladins are
easy to channel through, except for bash which is annoying.

Most rogues have low delay weaps anyway, their epic looks pretty quick.

Sro is a battlezone on RZ. A druid port, a wizard port, and theres
always lotsa high levels camping the AC there. Also not many mobs that
will get in the way of a 50+ fight.

Yep.

I've often wondered what it would be like to bet let lose on a blue
server with the same rules applying to me as RZ (ie can attacked anyone
within 4 levels, 1 item loot + coins). Can you say "pay day"? :p

Pet doesn't need see invis, and doesn't rely on you having it. If the
person is nearby the pet will go hit them and drop their invis, so you
can target the person. I always have dmf up (as well as about 6-7 other
buffs and 3 dot slots).

Also, once a pet is agro'd on an in-range person in the zone, I can
/assist my pet and the person who the pet is agro on will be targetted.
Even though they are 10 minutes walk away. Good for if you know someone
is going to try to kill you soon, so you just stand there with pet
agro'd, hitting the first offense spell hotkey until they get in casting
range.

There is class balance to an extent. If you are a persistant person, and
can handle being at a handy disadvantage in PvP for the first 55 levels,
then pick an SK or rogue.

Wizards are a competant pvp class from level 12, (shock of lightning
kills level 8 casters in 2 casts).

Necro's are a competant pvp class from level 12 also, (engulfing
darkness, heat blood, lifetap at that level).

Druids aren't anywhere near good until 19, and preferably 29. Their
snare line of spells is the least resisted of all movement debuffs, with
decent mr they will be resisted, but even with 70-80mr it sticks a lot.
Keep in mind most people wear all no-drop armour on PvP, so they rarely
have decent resists. (i have well over 100 in all resists, I have never
even max'd my int because I feel resists are more important).
