    Specifically, they're sprites. They maintain orientation relative to the
camera angle. There's a very nice screenshot over on FoH's site (where
they're picking the new particle effects apart) of a mage being skewered by
the beam of light from the self-buff Shielding line in an overhead view.

    If anyone wants to see angry, and in some cases overblown critique of
the new system the FoH site is the place.
