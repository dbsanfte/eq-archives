I want to return to my original premise.  I understand that some people want 
to group with friends and that it's difficult if you don't all start in the 
same city.  (Why didn't you all start in the same city? -- nevermind)

The point is that I, and many others, but not all, enjoy the challenges.  I 
find fun in graduating from West Freeport to East Commonlands or from 
Kelethin/GFay to Crushbone -- it's a sense of accomplishment.  Along the way 
there are quests and things to do that the power levelers miss entirely.  I 
am not into powerleveling and, to be honest, I don't care if I ever reach 
level 50 or higher.  The real point is I enjoy *playing the game* and not 
just grinding out levels or getting together with thirty or more friends and 
strangers and killing ubermobs.  I still enjoy killing dervs in Ro.

For those who say "well why don't you just do that?"  The answer is that the 
game is so distorted by the expansions that it's really no longer possible. 
East Commonlands is nearly empty and you end up trying to solo the orc 
camps.  The other once-popular zones are simply deserted.  It's impossible 
to find a group in any of the classic zones that were once full of people. 
Go to LGuk and you'll probably have the zone to yourself. (Good luck with 
that.)  Even killing dervs in N Ro is difficult because there's no one to 
team up with.  Everyone is off in Paludal power leveling.

I know there are other people like me out there who would play on a classic 
server and that would return to the game after quitting (like me).   I have 
found the thread on the SOE forums and it sounds like there's hope for such 
a thing, but I don't know.

One thing I don't understand is why some people are so vehemently opposed to 
this idea.  If you don't want to play on such a server that's fine.  Why do 
you want to argue against someone else doing so though?  I don't get it.
