I think my tolerance level has recovered to the point where I will go
work on my Troll's smithing skill some more. I had moved to the moon,
not finding a better place for him to do banded armor. The banded molds
and (I *hope* /em crosses fingers) stacked sheets of metal are sold in
the Stouts section of Shadowhaven. At least I know the molds are.

Problem is, those folks don't care much for me yet. I did the trade
commisioner quest a few times and got up to amiable with the generic
merchants, which include the shop where the forge, ore, etc. are sold.
And I can get the water nearby. But I'd like to be able to get it all in
one zone if possible. I'm willing to go do the Stout faction work, but
what experience have you all had in raising that? There are several
quests available that benefit the shorty faction, but which one worked
the best for those of you who did it? Remember, I can't gate/port etc.
so I'll be hoofing it the whole way for whichever quest I have to do
endlessly.

TIA
