You're right...I think it's a part of leveling...to be considered "grown up"
as a caster.  A rite of passage.  Something to look forward to, something
that makes the hell level not QUITE as bad.

Bad coding or not it's a part of the game that a lot of people would rather
not do without.  Probably not the majority, but hey, tough luck...if Verant
went by a democracy, you'd be able to prevent people from inspecting you,
but they don't, so quitcherbitchin'. :)
