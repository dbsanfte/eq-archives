America has interests.  Israel has proven to be a very good
ally of the US.  At the time of the sinking of the Liberty,
the US decided that the downside of fighting Israel was 
greater than the upside. At the time of the Libery, the Arab
states were firmly within the Soviet hegemony; no matter
what we did, they would not have suddenly become our friends,
and would have worked against our interests.  In contrast, 
allowing Israel a face-saving way out -- the false claims of
misidentification, the abject apologies, etc. -- was in
the intermediate-term and likely long-term best interests
of the US.

Regardless of what action the US took wrt the Liberty, there
was almost all downside and almost no upside.  Choosing the
path that provided the greatest upside is not a "double standard,"
it simply means you are measuring actions by the *wrong* standard.
