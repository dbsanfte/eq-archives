Well its been damaged on Test again.. I can't run two windows
effectively anymore, one of them's framerate is unbelievably bad and
stops completely if I turn to face certain things like corpses and
structures. Then when I zoned the GROUND was gone... though the
framerate improved immensely at that point interestingly.

It's better than it was after thursday's patch but still much much
worse than it was before that evil patch.

Sigh.
