> Beastlord: The New Druid? Discuss.

Scoring was on a 5 point scale, and this is how they stacked up.

Shaman-4.23 (this score was skewed because there were only two responses and
one of them was all 5's)
Druid-3.78
Bard-3.74
Wizard-3.55
Necromancer-3.49
Shadow Knight-3.40
Cleric-3.26
Beastlord-3.07
Rogue-2.95
Warrior-2.75
Mage-2.73
Monk-2.73

I also did not poll Paladins
