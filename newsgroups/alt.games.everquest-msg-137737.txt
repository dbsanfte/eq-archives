/agree

I played NWN's single player campaign non-stop for about a week and a
half after I picked it up from the store. I loved every minute of it.
Great story and a lot of fun. Once I finished it, I fired EQ back up
and haven't touched it since. I will go back to NWN someday (after
I've forgotten enough of the storyline to enjoy it a second time), but
SP RPGs just are not dynamic enough to hold my interest for very long.
