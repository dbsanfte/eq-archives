Heh, that's if were lucky.  The last event I saw personally was a gang (yes
that term works  hee) of GM's looking like desert madmen, with full
speed-hack in effect running around oasis slaughtering people for no
apparent reason.  Complete sadism if you ask me.  Just the GM's flexing
their "god's of norrath" muscle.
And in response to Dan's question "when was the last time they played
slaughter the newbies" this was about 6 months ago, if I remember right.
Recent enough that I approach these "events" with caution, personally.
And actually the LAST event I saw was the Halloween stuff last year, and yes
that was a blast.  The Oasis killing spree was a while before that.
Oh and then there was the apperance of Cazic-Thule near Cabilis, on Sullon
Zek.  He was passing out prezzies to his loyal followers 'til some high
level asswipes came and "owned his ass."  Ruined it for everyone, and the
loot sucked as far as I heard.
Hmmm, now that I think of it, I don't really blame the GM's for venting on
players.  Seems like I've heard more tales of events ruined by players than
complaints about the GM's.
New question, is it better on the rolplaying server?  Do the Iksar slaughter
their own god looking for uber loot or do they let the scenario play out?
I'd be interested to know....
