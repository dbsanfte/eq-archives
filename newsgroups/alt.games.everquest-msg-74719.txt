	No, the range is reduced.  That is according to Rowyl (the guy who coded
the current version of Tracking.)

	I'm a 56 Ranger with skill 200; I have an outdoor Tracking range of about
3500 feet (measured; Rowyl claimed that the range per skill point is different
for Druids and Bards but that is unconfirmed).  We have a guild Cleric camping
Ragefire now; I can't track the contents of the Nagafen chamber from the
Lavastorm entrance, and that's only about 1100 feet.  On the last patch day I
had to move up to bats1 (roughly -775,-250) to confirm that Nagafen was indeed
up.  That's more like 850-900 feet from the chamber.

	There is a Z-axis difference but it's not that large; certainly not enough
to triple the range.
