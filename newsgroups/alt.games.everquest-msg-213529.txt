I've been trying to get my Druid better faction for CoV.  I've never killed
a Drake or anything that would give a negative CoV faction hit, but when I
go to CS, they still scowl at me even after killing many,  many frost giants
in the past.

I decided to go to GD and kill at the giant fort for awhile and work on
faction.  After about the fourth or fith quad, I got a tell asking if I was
there for XP or faction.  I replied mainly for faction, most were LB with
the random DB for XP.  Got a response that they were faction hunting too,
and would I mind if they helped.  Well, result was I grouped with a 65
Cleric, 63 Enchanter, 62 Wizard, 55 Ranger, and me (53 Druid).  It was early
yet, and none of us had anything to do, so we killed literally non-stop for
about four RL hours.  I lost track of how many giants we killed, will have
to go check my log.

Anyway, after the 4 hour non-stop giant slaughter my standing with Kromriff
could not possibly get any worse...I popped over to CS to con.  Not scowling
at me anymore, but glowering apprehensively.  How many dang giants do I have
to kill to max faction with CoV?

TIA
