I haven't actually tried this with an evil character but I have seen iksars  
etc running around the moon. As I understand it, the Nexus Scions are 
neutral, so anyone can get a TP shard from them. And, like in Velious, 
everyone starts out with similar faction in the Bazaar (they're indifferent 
to everyone, so you can sell/bank), and Shadowhaven (most folk dubious, 
only a few will sell to anyone until you do some faction building).

Now, there are other places you might have better or worse starting 
faction, e.g. there are evil vendors in Echo Caverns who sell 
necro/sk/rogue stuff, then there's the whole Katta/Seru thing. There are 
two cities with a big sets of factions, Katta Castellum (goody-two shoes 
Paladins etc) and Sanctus Seru (Dictatorship/Police State) who are at war 
with each other. Seru does still have paladins etc, but they're all 
religious zealots, and evil factions tend to be allied with Seru and 
enemies of Katta (e.g. the Coterie vampires, who even have a couple of 
quests for evil folk I believe).

I would bet you'd be KOS in Katta, possibly not in Sanctus Seru, and 
possibly not KOS to Coterie, or at least not very KOS, fixable with a bit 
of faction work.

Shar Vahl, the Vah Shir city, seems to have a similar view of factions to 
Halas (i.e. they aren't too religious, but are ostensibly a good race - if 
you aren't KOS by default in Halas, you probably won't be to the cats 
either).

You don't mention your necro's level, so I have no idea if its realistic to 
suggest you go kill Katta guards for faction, etc.

If you are KOS in Sanctus Seru and too low level to kill stuff in Katta, 
you can always just base yourself at Shadowhaven/Bazaar, and run the 
'register for trading' quest a few times to be able to use the Shadowhaven 
merchants and bankers.

The zones directly off the Nexus/Shadowhaven are the same for everyone I 
think - full of mobs that hate all and sundry.
