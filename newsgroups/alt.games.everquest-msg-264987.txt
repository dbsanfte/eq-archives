I thought the Jedi FPS's were worth the price of admission, but most of 
what they make recently has been total dreck.

Another reason I think them taking over swg is a baaad idea.

(the first is, if the 'we taking back' rumors are true, a couple of the 
'what we are changing' rumors may be true... /wave all jedi stuff for 
pc's... taking out player cities, changing housing to be restricted 
areas, getting rid of pvp because it's not nice... etc)
