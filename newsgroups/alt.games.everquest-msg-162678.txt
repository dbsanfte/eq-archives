A level a day is certainly a sustainable goal.  Under current monk
constraints, unless you are exceptionally well twinked, I wouldn't try it
solo.

Duo or small or even full group doesn't matter too much, what you need is
someone that supplies the tools you are missing; heals, haste, slows,
ideally.

Looking at that list, a shaman or bard is probably your best partner, but
there's no reason not to add more members above that if they all
contribute fully; a real tank would save the healer mana, and more heavy
hitters would mean mobs die faster while not increasing the rate at which
your healer spends mana (it would increase the rate at which your slower
spends mana... unless slower is a bard, in which case no problem.  This is
why bard/cleric makes a powerful group core)

At any rate, the key to leveling up fast is to find something that you can
do that makes good experience and is sustainable, and then stick to it.
Moving from place to place, trying new strategies, things like this are
really enjoyable... but they cost exp per hour even if you don't die
trying them.  Find something thats really hard to do, and you can do it
for several levels before it becomes too low exp to bother with.  Moving
once every 5 levels will really not dent your leveling rate much at all,
compared to moving several times in one level.

The same is true of your group.  People who stick around for the long haul
are much better than people who are there for a half hour and then leave.
Constantly having to re buff, teach people whats going on, rework
strategies to accomodate different capabilities and so forth, this all
costs you exp you could have been making.  In fact, its this arguement
that is most powerfully in favor of soloing; solo, you never have to worry
about the people you are with, since its only you (and pet if you have
one)

At 43, I don't think you really have to move at all to reach 51, go to
City of Mist with a good small group and just stay there, moving a little
deeper inside as your group becomes more powerful.  I've rarely seen the
zone overcamped, its monk friendly, has a good zone bonus, is outdoors (if
you happen to have a sower/seloer/horse/druid/ranger where this matters)
A benefit of this plan is it is flexible, since you can duo, or ramp up
what you are doing if more people come to join you.  I suspect you can
even solo there at the entrance, perhaps not at 43 but in a couple levels,
leaving you even less susceptible to the whims of others.

Another possibility is The Hole entrance, but this is only a single
location, often camped, and you might find yourself having to do something
else many times when you show up and its taken.  This means travel time
and different plans, which as I said, will slow you down.  Maybe Hole with
COM as your constant backup plan.

I don't think this is the most enjoyable way to play EQ, but it is One
enjoyable way; set a goal and work to fulfil it; setting the time limit
makes it more of a challenge to overcome.

Have fun
