Dosent matter what you do the resell with just find good prices o gems or
whatever and resell em.
Before there was a bazaar many bought like Giang milita LS in GD/Kael and
took em to EC tunnel and sold em for like 150pp, dosent work nowdays but in
bazaar ive seen prices at Donals Vamb from 350-900 soo if you get thoose for
3-400pp you prob can sell em for 5-600 at least.
All is just a matter of time too seek out the right time to buy the thing..
I Recomend INT/WIS gear have been easiest to get rid of for me.
