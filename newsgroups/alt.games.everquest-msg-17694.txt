Hi,

Should one always give a weapon to the pet, as it is now
he hits for more then the weapon would, or will the weapon
add to his damage? i have played in lavastorm for a short time
and have used a pet with no weapon, that has worked fine, he
can even hit the fire elemental, but that may be because he is
using magical attack on stronger summons.

Thanks for any advice

/Berth
