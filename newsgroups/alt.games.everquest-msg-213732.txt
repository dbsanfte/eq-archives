Getting a group is simple.  The first day after my
main was copied over I walked into the tunnel in EC,
broadcast "65 non-betabuff mage LFG" and had one within
2 minutes.  10 minutes later we were running across
N. Ro headed for a quicksand pit.

Unfortunately I only got to do a few adventures before
RL made it so I wasn't able to play EQ for a couple of
weeks.
