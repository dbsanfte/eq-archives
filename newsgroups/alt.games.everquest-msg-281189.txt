First off, you've known me for some time as Rumbledor. I've just decided 
to drop the alias is all. No interesting reasons. /wave

I've got a pretty good idea where the OP is coming from. It has nothing 
to do with any sort of perceived obligation. I kind of feel the same way. 
I played EQ for a few years, getting bored with it, leaving and going 
back on several occasions during that time, until I just decided there 
was no use trying to rekindle my interest.

I tried City of Heroes and, while it was great fun for a while, I just 
found it ultimately lacking in depth. The story was there. It just didn't 
have enough of a game to do it justice.

Went back to EQ for a while. Tried playing some alts. It didn't work for 
long, though it was a nice diversion.

I tried DAoC, even though I have little interest in PvP or RvR. The skill 
system was interesting, but I just didn't care for the graphics and found 
the combat and spell effects kind of cheesy. It just didn't offer enough 
to pull me in early.

Went back to EQ for a while. Tried some more alts. There is really 
something to be said for the wide range of classes that game offers. It 
kept me entertained for a time once again.

I tried WoW as well. That one was *really* fun...for a while. The 
graphics are just incredible and the art direction superb. However, it 
seemed like it ended up being too much of a good thing, as far as the 
game itself went. While I always wished EQ was more true to its name, 
offering more quests, WoW seemed to just go overboard with it. I just 
felt like I was following directions all the time, and the travelling 
required in doing so was extensive and often a bit too transparent in its 
timesink design. Like I said though, it was fun for a while.

I actually bought EQ2 before WoW, but I ended up splitting my time 
between the two for a while. I was blown away by EQ2's graphics and its 
approach to tradeskills. The gameplay was very interesting as well with 
the heroic opportunities, upgradable skills and such. What I *didn't* 
like were a vanilla archetype system and locked enounters

Went back to EQ one more time. Tried some new things. Same old game 
though, and just getting worse for me. I don't want to get too far into 
it, but IGE/the like and obsolete content played a big part in my 
completely losing interest.

Time to get to the point. Where does that leave me? It leaves me a MMORPG 
gamer without a game. I'm basically stuck in a holding pattern while I 
wait for Vanguard to pull me in next year. For that reason I find myself 
just killing time on games I've already put down at least once for one 
reason or another. It's not that I can't fathom doing anything else. I 
could be watching television, reading a book, playing tennis, basketball 
or just going for walks. Fact is, I already find time to do those things, 
but I still want to get my game on, so to speak. In the past month I've 
renewed single month subscriptions to three different MMORPG's, just 
trying to find one I've already played that might keep me entertained, at 
least for a while.

Right now I'm back to EQ2 to check out the steps they've taken to make it 
a bit more EQ-like. I guess you could say I'm giving it another chance. 
No, I don't owe it to them. I still feel that SoE is blatant in their 
fleecing of their customer base. I still feel that the Station Exchange 
is a shameless manafestation of that philosophy.

I still feel it has the potential to be worth $15/month. It may serve as 
a nice change of pace, anyway...at least until Sigil hooks me up with a 
Vanguard beta invite. ;)
