Which is strange, because wasn't it Sony that was shipping laptops with EQ 
installed not too long ago? Not to mention the fact that it's their own 
product.

I am able to play EQ fine on my Toshiba Satellite. It's a couple years old 
now, but I don't have to throttle back too many settings to play. That 
said, I have not tried OoW on it, but it handled Luclin and PoP pretty 
well.

It is a P4M 1.7GHz, 512MB RAM with nVidia GeForce4 440 Go 32MB graphics. It 
gets pretty hot underneath, as most gaming laptops will, even with the 
mobile pentium processor.
