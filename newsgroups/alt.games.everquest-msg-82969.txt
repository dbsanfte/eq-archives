Let me esplain.. no there is too much, let  me sum  up

Both Grimrots and Lord B within 24 hours real time, not even making much
of an effort.  Was headed to Lake Rathe to begin camping Lord B with
cleric and druid combo.  Druid notices Grimrot on track, but just as we
got there another group shouted for a camp check on him and pulled dead
version.  When they finished my cleric noticed they had neither cleric
nor paladin with them and talked them out of the drop.  Headed on to
Rathe in time to watch a guild turn in the Lord B crown they'd just
picked up so I figured that was a dead camp for a while.  Picked off the
Grimrot PH before bed and called it a night.  PH was down when I logged
back in next morning so druid headed off to Lake to check on Lord B
which was a shame cause live grim popped shortly after and refusing to
be rooted managed to off the cleric who was bound in Nexus heh.  Managed
to get back down and meet the druid before someone else nabbed him and
Grim went down much easier with the help.  Some quick faction work and
the dwarf was wearing the nifty shield on his back.  Couple hours or
less under Lake Rathe later and Lord B arrived to meet his fate as
well!  Of course now Lord G will hide from me for the next six months
but for one day it sure was all falling into place.
