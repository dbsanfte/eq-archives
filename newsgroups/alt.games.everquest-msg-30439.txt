I had to do no tweaking and jerryrigging whatsoever to get EQ to run under
2000.  In fact I had it running under a W2K beta without issues (I think I was
still using a Voodoo card then, and 2K came with DX compatible drivers).

The problems most people run into are drivers.  Many video card manufacturers
have bad DX support in their W2K drivers.  nVidia has gotten much better, but
I still have issues using the latest detonator drivers with W2K and EQ, so I
stick with drivers that are a little older but stable.  But the fact is, if a
game is written "correctly" (i.e. never tries to talk directly to hardware,
doesn't automatically reject non-Win9x OS's, etc.), and you have good drivers,
then it will run under W2K out of the box.

EA's Triple Play Baseball specifically states that Windows 2000 is not
supported.  Yet it ran on the first try, without any issues.  *shrug*  Windows
2000 was originally going to be geared towards home users, but MS chickened
out and decided to do one more spin of crash-happy Win9x (a.k.a. ME).  My
guess is that they realized they needed to get developers a little more in
line before making the jump.  I've been very happy with W2K as my gaming
platform.  The key is definitely drivers--the OS itself supports everything
just fine.
