Here's something I came up with during my wyvern-quadding days. Enjoy!

Living In A Quadder's Paradise
by Whittleberry

As I walk along the beach near the point of egress
I take a look at my life and realize there's lots left
'Cuz I've been blasting and grinding so long
That even my guildies thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never killed a mob that didn't deserve it
Me be beaten like a monk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch who you snarin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your mobbies might be trainin' the block
I really hate to log, but I gotta go
I hope one day I'll see myself as a Heirophant, fool
I'm the kinda D the little newbies wanna be like
On my knees day and night
Medding up for the next fight

I been spending most my life
Living in a quadder's paradise
I kill bulthar once or twice
Living in a quadder's paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in a quadder's paradise
I sell hides at discount price
Living in a quadder's paradise

I know the the situation
I got good faction
I can live with those who kite
I was raised to place nice
So I gotta be good to the guys in teams
Too much Allakhazam readin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm an educated druid with xp on my mind
Got my Paw in my hand and a veil o'er my eye
I'm a buffed-out badass c2-seekin' halfling
And the drakes are around, so dont arouse my anger, fool
Linkdeath ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm living life quadding mobs, what can I say?
I'm 53, now but will I live to see 54
The way things are going, I hope so

Tell me why are we not filled with glee
'Cuz the mobs we hunt give great xp

I been spending most my life
Living in a quadder's paradise
I kill bulthar once or twice
Living in a quadder's paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in a quadder's paradise
I sell hides at discount price
Living in a quadder's paradise

Loot and the xp, xp and the loot
Yellow after yellow, blue after blue
Everybody's quadding, but half of them ain't watchin'
What's going on with the wyverns, 'til they grab Yvolcarn
They say they've got aggro but nobody's gonna help 'em
If they're too dumb to con, how can they be leveling?
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess they're fooked
That's why I know their life is out of luck ... fool 

I been spending most my life
Living in a quadder's paradise
I kill bulthar once or twice
Living in a quadder's paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in a quadder's paradise
But you'd probably think it bites
Living in a quadder's paradise
