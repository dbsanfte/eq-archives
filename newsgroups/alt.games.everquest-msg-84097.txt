nothing helps. I got him once by hanging around outside getting bone
chips until I finally saw him on track. I've never seen him since
then. Its just a rare chance mob and not at all worth what you get in
the quest which is basically junk. The most I ever spent specifically
tracking for him was about a half hour at a time which is pretty much
my strategy for any rare spawn in EQ. If the thing is not around or up
in half an hour, I'm not waiting. That strategy has got me 2 jboots
for twinks in oot, 3 wiltins for ivory legs, countless oracle robes
while hanging around for a few minutes for the former things, the rare
bear in everfrost for the shaman helm once (now on my vah shir kitty..
whee!) and that grizzleknot tree in south karana. I'd count the
ancient jarsath on that but really can't since my 46 druid got him
about when kunark was first out and no one knew of that quest yet so
he was up fairly often (so glad I saved what he dropped all this time)
