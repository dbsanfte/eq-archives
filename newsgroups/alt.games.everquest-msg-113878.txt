The other night I was just inside the zone in crush bone, when a few
characters came running through and zoned out.  They were being chased
by an orc or two, one stayed. Don't remember the designation, trainer,
slaver, whatever, but I thought I would take a shot at him.  At first
I thought it was a glitch, there seemed to be a dwarf warrior or
ranger type blended in with the orc ?  It was like, here is this tall
orc, who from the ground up to his stomach, has a built in dwarf
morphed into him.  Next thing I know, not only am I registering hits
from the orc, I'm getting pounded by the dwarf punching at me?   When
my health got really low, since I had my back to the zone, I tried to
back out of the zone...didn't work.  Dead.   Was this infact a glitch
or is there such a wierd Mob or spell  that gives this appearence ?
