Shrug. One of my favourite memories of EQ was accidentally selling
my ebony bladed longswords in Oggok after a very long day in Cazic
Thule with my bags full of the identical graphic fine steel longswords
(4pp each or so, that was *money*). After mournfully trying to buy
back every single item on the vendor to pop the swords back into
view, I despondantly told my group what I'd done. Oh Crapsticks.

5 minutes later one of them turned up minus his efreeti boots and
with a pair of ykesha shortswords and a big smile. The consequence
of the game, the difficulty, the long downtimes lead, for me at
any rate, to lots of time making friends, building genuine 
camaraderie, and a genuine empathy when things like that happened.

It wasn't 'FFS stop whining and come to outer caves to grind it out',
it was 'Oh, OUCH, what can we do to help?'. I remember generous druids
porting me to corpses half way across the world and making my friends
list forever after. I remember guarding a naked caster across velious
with SOW and invis for much the same reasons and being offered groups
by them for a fortnight after. I remember the difficulty lending the
game depth, and meaning, and requiring players to help and support
one another in a way that lead to real friendships.

But thats what *I* remember ;) I can see others might remember having
to walk 45 minutes without a peep from anyone ;) I certainly remember
shouting obscenities at my monitor after dying for the third time in
Guk bound in freeport in a night ;)

But it was exactly that threat that made the successful completion of
traveling from Qeynos to Freeport at level 8 such a thrill. Of creeping
through Oggok with invis and sneak to explore. Of all the other stupid
crazy fun things we did. Really, who gives a crap if you die with
instant 96% rez? its not like thats raider only.

Well, competent raiders, maybe, in todays game. It wasnt as simple
as you imply if you wiped deep in TOV or Fear. No Graveyards. Long
travel time to the zone. KOS creatures everywhere. No SOS. Watch
monks try and FD drag your entire guilds bodies to a safe spot while
the druids ferry everyone to cobalt scar then watch them try to run
naked through sirens grotto and the western wastes and tell me
theres no penalty.

But EQ isnt doom. The core difference in philosophy, and the one that
seems to have won out in EQ design ethos, is that it *is* doom. That
unless you're fighting and pushing the xp meter up you're not *playing*.

I always used to think Sonys greatest scam was successfully making us
pay to provide one another with content while they sat back and raked
in the cash for providing a few props and theatre backdrops. They
seem to have lost sight of that approach and imagined we (I ;) )
play to play the *game*. The game of EQ is *boring*. Its turning on
autoattack and watching two red bars decrease. Its easy, and it 
doesnt change from 1-70, raiding or casual, substantively. A few
interesting pulls + crowd control, a few close heals, thats it.

Ok, so thats an exageration, but my point is - the interesting bit
is the other people, and the obstacles you overcome together. If you
remove all requirements to work together with people, smooth the
obstacles out entirely for the worst and most antisocial players,
reduce the game solely to a constant stream of click-killing, then...

you've removed what made everquest an interesting game, and turned it
into a crappy Doom. People say EQ doesnt start till 65 nowadays. Or
70 now, I suppose. Thats because raiding is the one activity left
that requires group cooperation, has a difficulty level, and ironic
as it is given your post above, incurs significant downtime in terms
of prep, travel and wipe recovery , that leads to people actually
getting to know one another and build shared experiences.

By removing those things that make raiding attractive from the 1-70
game, by turning it into just a constant 'grind' they have removed
the *game*.

In my opinion ;)
