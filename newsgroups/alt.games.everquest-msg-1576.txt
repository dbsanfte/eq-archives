Weird. You SHOULD be able to get in fine. I once wondered that, and I
made a sample level 1 human shadowknight of Innoruuk and ran him over
there. He was glowered at, but I had no problems.

In fact, my Erudite Shadowknight of Cazic-Thule was also only glowered
at in Neriak, so I can go in at will with that one too. If I can get in
(I dont even worship the same god, and I'm an even weirder human subtype
than you), you should be able to. I was even able to safely go to 3rd
gate to do the wine quest (which raises faction with most all the
neriak groups). I am now considered warmly.

So, maybe dorn has some other faction in addition to his dark elf ones
that triggered you, or maybe you have accidentally lowered some dark elf
faction with a quest, or maybe I am just wrong.

But I am pretty sure you can get in. Try it with a new temporary human
SK of Inny and see if an untainted level 1 can run over to neriak and
get in. Then you will know for sure. If you are out of character slots,
just try on a different server.
