So when does Instill Doubt actually begin to work? What skill level?

I'm not being snide here, really, I tried using this with my rogue and it
NEVER worked, not one single time.  The only time it ever worked was on
greenies when I was practicing and even then it only worked about one in
forty times.  I got the skill to about 140 I think before I shelved my
rogue.
