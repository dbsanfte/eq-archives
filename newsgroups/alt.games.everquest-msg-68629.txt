I'm running the new one.  The other program DxWindows kept crashing.  All it
does is set me on the same level as the thousands of other players that have
more than one computer on their desk.  I can post a message to a board, send
an ICQ, etc.  It doesn't give me an advantage over any other player with
multiple systems.  In fact, since I'm in a window, my game is slowed a
little by it.
