In Highkeep, the erudite enchanter spell merchant on the main floor is on a
separate faction - you can sell to him.

And 'pet weapons'? You have no reason to give your pet fine steel weapons
past level 29.  The fine steel weapon drops are the reason that this camp is
good money!

My personal philosophy on necros and faction is this: If I'm not feared and
despised in every town but my own, then I must not be a very scary or
intimidating necro! That philosophy is somewhat easier to maintain since PoK
came into being....

You definately, definately, DEFINATELY need to learn to agro kite.  Mobs
past level 55 cannot be feared, period.

Easy runthrough here for you:

Cast snare (use NOTHING but DOOMING DARKNESS until level 63)
Cast high agro dot (like Venom of the Snake or Envenomed Bolt)
Cast another dot (maybe ignite blood or asystole)
Cast lifetap dot.
Sick pet at 90% of mob hp. (with pet taunt OFF)
Pick your path, and sit at every opportunity.
Keep snare on the mob!
Reapply dots as mana and agro permits.

Ideally, you want to finish with full mana.  Dont' waste dots either... you
want all of your dots but snare to fade just about when the mob dies.

Don't play into the idea that more dots is better - stick with 2.  Sure you
can kill faster if you stack a crapload of dots, but then you're sitting on
your ass regenning mana.

Don't cast the lifetap dot until you are missing the exact amount of hp that
it will heal. It isn't very mana-efficient anyway, no reason to make it
worse.  (of course that goes out the window when you get saryrn's kiss, as
you'll use that for damage as well)

If you kill the mob withing the initial snare's duration, you're probably
killing mobs that are too easy.  2 snares is just about right... just keep
aware of the % the mobs hp is usually at when the first snare fades. If
you're taking on tougher targets, like say the gargs in PoN from 56-61 or
so... you'll need 4 casts of snare per kill.

 At that point, it becomes pretty tricky to time your snares. You can do 2
things to help with that.

1) each time you cast darkness, start counting aloud to 90.  That way you
know how much longer snare has left.  Gets a tad annoying after a few hours
of kiting though

2) Download a UI timer.  I got one that lets you customize it to the
duration of your choice. You just need to slide an arrow to the point on the
timer where you cast snare (on mine at least), and you're golden (would get
you link, but can't find it atm.. will try to find later)

For resisted snares, keep SoW'd at all time, whether by potions or jboots.
You'll get good at casting quickly, using the terrain to stay ahead of mobs,
and using 3rd person view (F9 4 times, and use alt-arrow keys to rotate
viewpoint... be sure to get used to that and use while kiting)
