Yeah I understand this. But none the less, the amount of effort put
into  outside sources for referances for this game is staggering. That
this isn't writtin for newbies/starting chars, some place, does
surprise me. Figuring this info out could and would take alot of the
fun away, I mean traveling on a long dangourse run to a city and
getting nailed time after time  just to figure out where you can go
and can't is not cool.
