I have that same LinkSys router but I haven't had any problems. I haven't 
done any upgrades to its firmware since I bought it, however, so possibly 
that's why it hasn't caused issues. For things like this I figure why 
upgrade when it works fine now? My connection can only go so fast and it's 
working fine now, so upgrading firmware on the router isn't gonna improve 
anything anyway :)

On a side note, last night my connection went down during EQ. I was safe 
at the time, so it wasn't too bad. I noticed I was losing like 50% both 
ways at first, but my ping was way down, like 60 or something. It looked 
like it was slowly improving, went to around 38%. Then it finally went out 
altogether. I tried to go to some webpages, and it said 'Connecting to 
blah.com' (or whatever) rather than a nonexistant connection message of 
'Find host: blah.com' (or whatever). I just racked it up to the hours long 
thunderstorm we were having. This morning I came out and tried to go to a 
website, however, and it was still down. Anyhow, I powered down the DSL 
modem and then plugged it back on. Problem solved. I guess I should have 
figured it out the night before when I tried to ping my DSL modem and got 
no response. Stupid me!

:)
