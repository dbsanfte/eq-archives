Ok, this is ridiculous, i now have a full inventory of nothing but
collectables like bone fragments and butterflies, with just a little taken
up by food and drink. I've taken to destroying as I go. Does anyone know if
this will drop in a particular zone eg antonica? I was walking with 3
pristine maple boxes full of nothing but butterflies. A few i got to sell
off as i waddled, but noone ever saw one, or reported it, and the one
selling for 3 gp has gone. I'm guessing they are used to twink alts?
