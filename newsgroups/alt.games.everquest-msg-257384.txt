See, I don't know if I believe it was lowered.  I think it could easily 
have always been low, and people were fooled by the kill rate into 
thinking it was high until someone actualy measured it, back when ShowEQ 
could do that. (Or maybe it still can... I've never used SEQ and can't 
say.)

>(I'd have to borrow a hat, but you get my point).

Aye, I'm somewhat suprised when I see it, too.  But having looked at a 
variety of lists, with differing numbers to suggest they were generated by 
different people, Loio is consistently listed as lower than 'average 
outdoor'.  So I suspect it -is- in fact lower, but I'm not heavily 
committed to how much lower.

Cool.  I like cake. :)
