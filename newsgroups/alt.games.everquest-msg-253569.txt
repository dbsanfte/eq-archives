Except the court would have to interfere in this case, by forcing me
to pay him $1000 for a worthless item.

Oh boo hoo.  Care to throw that example up so I can take it apart? 
You've already ably demonstrated that you don't have much of a mind
for specifics or for definitions.  I'd be willing to bet your
"airtight" example wouldn't apply, *just like everything else you've
posited in this discussion*.

Advice you should take to heart, Faned.

A "worthless pebble" is not of "indeterminate value".  It's worthless.

The word "worthless" here means zero value.

I mean, I suppose we could have a completely disjointed conversation
about what constitutes consideration, but the whole point here is that
if the Court is going to enforce a contract to purchase plat, it's
going to have to find that the plat has some value.

Because, if it doesn't, the contract is void for lack of
consideration.  Which is why we're talking about a _worthless_ pebble.

I'm sure you could find a pebble of indeterminate value.  Heck, maybe
a pebble you find on the street is actually an uncut diamond worth
thousands of dollars!  But that's not relevant here, because that's
not the hypothetical. The hypothetical is about a worthless pebble,
not a random pebble.  You keep trying to give it worth.  That's
changing the hypothetical.  Feel free to keep rambling about pebbles
that are of indeterminate value, but remember, that's not what I'm
talking about.

Yes, of course.  You seem to be incapable of distinguishing the word
"worthless" from the phrase "indeterminate value", so hence there's
nothing to suggest here that you've found something even remotely
applicable in the included caselaw.

LOL.  Let's read that again!

"you at least have a *chance* of arguing that the *actual* value of
the "worthless pebble" is relevant"

But Faned, the "actual value" of a "worthless pebble" is, you know,
"worthless".  I'm not sure why I have to even argue that.  According
to our hypothetical, this isn't even in dispute.

Tell me again how something that's worthless is of indeterminate
value.  Also tell me how a "shipment" is a "delivery" and how
"relevant" is "irrelevant" and any number of the basic blunders you've
exhibited here.  Do it to a waltz.  I saw a neat waltz in a movie
recently.
