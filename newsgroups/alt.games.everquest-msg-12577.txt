Gotta disagree with you on that one, I have run into PD a few times since I
have finally gotten few lvls and they have always been nice. This past
weekend I was in Hate and they had 7 members there. They stayed out of our
way, informed us what they were pulling (we were never trained btw), and
when we got slaughtered they stopped what they were doing and rezed the all
30+ people and stayed with us until we got back on our feet. BTW, they did
mention that we problably shouldn't tell anyone cause it will ruined there
reputation as KSing, training, loot stealing jerks, but oh well.
Don't think this is a recent development either.
It seems that they got that rep when they were able to take down areas and
got frustrated because they would wait on other guilds to do an area that
couldn't handle it. Then when they took the area down others would whine. Um
I have no sympathy there if you can't handle it then get out of the way, its
like that everywhere so planes should be no different.
Besides they don't do much in the planes any longer, they are exploring
stuff in Veeshan's.

After PD I would guess Dealers of Death or Magna Charta as the next in line.

PD is the archetypical wannabe uber guild. They're quite willing to
shit all over everyone when they want something. KSing, training, no
tactic is too low for them. Once they've pharmed what they want, they
whine that they're not given proper respect because they quit KSing
and training people in that zone, but people still remember it for
some reason.

They're kind of a third rate FoH in that regard. At least when FoH
were training people in the planes they were the first to do so.
