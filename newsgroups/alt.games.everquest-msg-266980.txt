Yeah.  Haven't gone to the extreme you describe, though.

I'm going to make a last-ditch effort by being ruthless in cleaning my HD, 
then defragging again, although I aleady have about half of a 120 gig drive 
free.  If that doesn't improve things, then I dunno.  It's certainly odd 
seeing reports of decent performance with systems not really close to mine, 
spec-wise.

The only thing I've ever experienced remotely close to what I'm experiencing 
was several years ago with the flight sim by iMagic, iF-22, which was a 
known clunker.
