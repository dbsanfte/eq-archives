If that's the case and he's *not* selling platinum, why are his prices
graded by how much platinum you're buying from him?

And why does he advertise platinum sales and not the service you claim
he's offering?

Besides, scalping's not illegal in every state in the US.  If you buy
from someone's business located in Delaware, there's nothing illegal
about that transaction whatsoever.
