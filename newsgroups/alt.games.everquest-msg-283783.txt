Silly me, I thought a necro's job (one of them anyways) was to provide much 
needed mana to the casters of the group. After once again grouping with a 
necro last night who does not do this (When I asked him if he could give me 
some mana he said "no offence, but I have NEVER needed to use that spell 
before!)... I am here to ask, what is a necro for then? They have a pet to 
fight... I've heard they are not good fighters. I thought they were to 
assist with the mana. My bad??

Most I've found want to nuke the hell out of mobs, waste their mana... and 
not be supportive of the group. Comments?
