I don't think the "/testbuff" feature is not intended for people who
are unfamiliar with a given class. I think it is for people who want
to play on test occasionally without the hassle of leveling up from
scratch. In other words if you had started a Druid or Cleric (two
classes you seem to be already familiar with), you wouldn't have any
problems at all playing them on test.
