Turning in 3250 gold, a shadowed rapier, and a Ring of the Ancients to some
guy in Rathe Mountains gives pretty good XP...about as much as soloing two
level 60 mobs (before the recent XP changes).  It also gives a nice item.

Giving gold to the mercant in the NW corner of SRo gives XP.  It doesn't
give much, but if you have a billion plat sitting around unused, I think I
worked out once that would get you from 1 to around 60. :-)
