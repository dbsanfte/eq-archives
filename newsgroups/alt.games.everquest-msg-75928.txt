Ugh.  I want to know how to get my Halflings appearance back to what it was
originally - the little blonde guy with the scruff on his face.

No matter what I try, I get every other Halfling male look with new textures
turned off but can't seem to get back to that original face.

After 40 levels you kinda get used to what your char looks like *sigh*

Oh - and for your question, in SoL you should have a 'face' button at the
bottom of your inventory gump.
