Besides, we're fixated on the idea that EQ *can be* a RPG if we
choose, not that it *is* a RPG. He can't even get that right :)

Besides, I've spent way more time of my life as a user/staff
member/admin of a text chat than I have as an EQ player. The
chat was Arthurian themed, but roleplaying was a voluntary thing
there too. I RP much more often in EQ than I did there...
