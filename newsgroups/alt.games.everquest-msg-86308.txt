Ha, I play two chars at once and the cleric/warrior combo SUCKS.

Cleric monk is great. You get nice damage output. Monks have nice high AC
and with heals can take quite a nice beating, and the best part is, if in
doubt Monk FD and cleric DA and run to zone, or Monk get full health and
hold mobs while cleric gates and then FDs. Warriors get in trouble one of
you will die. Monks don't need taunt, I can double hits for well over 200
points per round PLUS kick for 100+ regularly. I've had combat rounds where
I do 500 points in a few seconds (rare as they are it happens)

Adding a shaman or an enchanter to that pair would just be insainly good.
