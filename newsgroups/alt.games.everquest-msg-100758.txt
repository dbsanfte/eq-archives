If it is your first time to Seb and you are doing Juggs,  I hope the rest of
your group has been there (im sure they have).  My advice would be stay
close to your group and take your time getting down there, things can get
crazy fast just getting through the jail area.  Also make sure you know
where the zone out is down there.  A CR down there suxs bad, unless there is
another group down there killing Juggs or froggies.
