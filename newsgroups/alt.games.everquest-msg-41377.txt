Napalm on children that know no better than to oppose your beliefs is a
barbaric act.
What is needed is an intelligence led removal of the instigators of
atrocity-eg Bin Laden.
Also an understanding of the enemy culture.
Every martyr to the Islamic cause is believed to be able to take 70 of
his/her family to heaven with him/her.
Creation of martyrs merely serves to inflame the situation. Justice is best
served by individuals being made to pay for their crimes-there is no justice
in the killing of innocents anywhere.
America has been labelled "The Great satan" by the Islamic faction groups.
It would be a greater strike to them to prove by measured action that
America is not worthy of this title.
