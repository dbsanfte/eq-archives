At that level I made the run up to High Hold Keep and stayed there through
level 30.  The  only down side is you have to wait on a  list at times to
get into a group.  Exp is great and the loot is pretty good too.  From 30-35
I went back to mseru and practiced up on grey hoppers and the rock guys....
35-45 hands down has been DawnShroud Peak one week to accomplish this only
playing in the evenings.  Now I guess I am gonna have to go to Dreadlands
for a while because things are either lb to me including most large zelniaks
or red and yellow Sambata tribesman warriors or Rockhoppers.
