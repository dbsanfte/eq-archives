They are already set up for more than 8 characters per account per
server.  This was illustrated several months ago when The Nameless had
a major crash, and they had to replace the hardware and do a full
restore from backup.  Many of us found that we were missing some of
our current characters, and instead had various old characters we had
deleted in their places.  We were told that the fix to this was simply
to delete the old characters again, because all our characters were
actually there, but only 8 could be shown.  Sure enough, for each old
character deleted, one of the missing ones took its place.

This incident also illustrated some holes in Verant's backups.  First,
they don't seem to be backing up any record of what the current
characters are.  This meant that if anyone on the server had *ever*
had the same name as your character, then you could lose your name in
the restore.  If it restores their old deleted character first, then
yours gets an automatic name change to resolve the conflict.  The GMs
cannot fix this for you, because they have no way of verifying that
you are the rightful user of that name, and even if they could, they
have no way to go and find and rename the older character with that
name.  The best you can do is hope that that person deletes the
character again, and then try to get the GMs to change your name.

Second, they don't backup guild names.  If you were in a guild, your
character was still in that guild, but it had no name.  Guildchat
still went to the right people.  They had no procedure for getting
your guildname back, either.  Instead, after a few days, they
disbanded all guilds, and said we'd have to all go and recreate our
guilds.

So, my feeling about the great Nameless crash were mixed.  On the one
hand, it was only down for about two days...not bad when the hardware
has a major failure on a Friday, and then they replace that with new
hardware, and then *that* has a complete failure a few hours later.
That was certainly beyond what they had planned for, and they handled
it fairly well.  On the other hand, finding out that they don't have a
complete backup of the user-related data is pretty frightening.  Even
if it mean that on a complete restore, we got rolled back several
days, I'd rather have that than having this weird mix of old and new
stuff.
