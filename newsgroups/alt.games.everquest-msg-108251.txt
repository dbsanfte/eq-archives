Ahh victims aren't we all.....

I love the portion of american culture where we privatize personal
gain and socialize personal losses.

So if EQ is the cause for somebody's death and failures in life; does

MMOG; does Verant deserve a piece his financial success or creative
credit for the new game?

lawyers. :-^
