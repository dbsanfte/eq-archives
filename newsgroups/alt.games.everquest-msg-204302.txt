First off, as others have said, PoP isn't the place to revive your
skills. Unless you do PoJ. Velks and KC sound like good options. I
also recommend Nadox and Hate's Fury in LoY. After that, try PoN/PoI
but only with a good tank (~lvl 55).  Avoid PoD at all cost until you
are confident with your abilites. There is really no margin for error
in this zone.

Some tips that might help you...

1) When I don't know my tank's abilities very well or if it's my first
time fighting a certain type of mob, I start the CH as soon as the
tank starts taking hits. After 8 secs into the CH I look at the tanks
health and decide whether to allow the CH to go through, or to duck
and cancel it. Generally, if the tank has gone from 100% down to 60%
in 8 secs, he is losing health too fast and I let the CH land.

2) I generally don't cast CH later than 50% tank HP for slowed mobs,
70% for unslowed mobs. Anything lower and your spell may not have time
to land.

3) As was already mentioned, Remedy is a joke for healing casters in
PoP. If you see a mob go for your chanter, start casting Divine Light
or Ethereal Light right away. Dont wait for his health to drop, just
cast it. This sense of urgency isn't required with
wizards/mages/necros. If they die, you can rez and get back on track.
If the slower/crowd controller dies, it could mean a wipe. I typically
use remedy for small patching of casters after the mob is off them.

4) I would recommend against casting Cel. Healing on the tank at
incoming. I've had it aggro me far too many times. It's best to begin
casting a CH and cancel if it's not needed. By the time the CH lands,
the tank should have enough aggro to keep the mob off you. Use Cel.
Healing after the fight has begun.

5) It always helps to have a SHD or PAL instad of a warrior because
their ability to hold aggro is simply amazing and it will mean less
people for you to heal.

As far as gear goes, one of my best investments was an Emerald
Dragonscale Breastplate. This has +20 WIS and decent AC plus some
saves. If your guild can do Woushi in WL for the scales, you can quest
this for about 300pp. Otherwise they sell on most servers for 8-10k.

Hope this helps you =)
