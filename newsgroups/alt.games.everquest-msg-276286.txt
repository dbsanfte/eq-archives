Google for various answers to this question, it's been done successfully 
in the past, SoE has also denied the transfer in the past.  Pretty much, 
as far as I can tell, it's a crapshoot as to whether or not it will 
happen.  Basically though, change all the billing info to be identical on 
the accounts, then wait a while, and try the transfer.
