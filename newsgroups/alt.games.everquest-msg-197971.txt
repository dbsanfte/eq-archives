    It's a raid spell, for insuring against damage spikes. When mobs quad
for profane amounts, "lucky shots" can flat-out kill a tank. DI covers the
CH chain against that. Considering that once you get the target's CHA above
a certain point it goes off over 90% of the time, it's well worth it. I
wouldn't use it in a group, though - the component cost and relatively short
length of the buff make it undesirable except perhaps when planning for
something big (a large pull to break an area, or a nasty named).

    Without the long recast time raid tanks would become almost unkillable.

    They had messages that told the healer how much they'd healed for. Wish
that had worked out, as it makes for great real-time feedback.

    I don't see this being used except when reviewing logs to see how a
healing strat works. Sort of silly to put this in before putting in damage
messages on nukes, IMO.

    I think it might have been the mem blur component of mezzes that did it.
NPC ENCs would try to mez folks, and NPC spells land on targets waaaaaaay
outside the proper level range. I think I already told the group the story
about the Wake The Dead ENC pet charming Fennin Ro, didn't I?

    It's now cheaper and has a better resist adjustment. They also nerfed
the amount of the reverse damage shield, though (same as Karn). In essence,
it is now made to do exactly what you wanted: remove the damage shield from
a mob.

    Something like 500 MANA. Wizards bumped up against it, and people with
certain special gear. But mostly wizards.
