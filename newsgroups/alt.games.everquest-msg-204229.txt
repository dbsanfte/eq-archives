: The slow language learning was unnerfed maybe a year ago. Ive never heard
of
: being assigned an alignment. Sounds like what you read was well out of
date.
:

"Unnerfed"?  I always thought that a a true "Nerf" would make something
softer or, in other words, easier.  So making it easier (read as trivial) to
learn a language would be a "Nerf".  The KEI fix would actually be an
"unnerf" or making something more difficult.  The new group bonus would be a
"nerf".  The change in the trivials for Blacksmithing was an "unnerf".  And
so on...
