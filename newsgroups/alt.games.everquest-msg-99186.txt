That wasn't my experience.  There was a time that it flat out did nothing.
I stopped playing my bard for a couple of weeks while they fixed that and
other things.  Slowly they restored the bards back to fully operational again,
getting the song effects to look right, etc.

I found that the extra /stopsong is slightly faster than /pause 1, and is sufficient for
me to not get the "you have not recovered" message.  So I don't see how
/pause xxx is better that an extra /stopsong  (?)

In a heavy spell casting fight with a lot of particle effects going off, I do
a /showspelleffects off and that helps with lag considerably.

But I'm still only level 35 and have yet to run a group where there are more than a few
mobs at once.  Perhaps the lag will get worse and I'll need to up the delay.

Thanks
