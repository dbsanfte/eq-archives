Cost me about 14pp, heard of it costing much more if you're not lucky.
Apparently, you can give wrong cards back and receive another, but he just

cost 4gp a time, how can it have cost you 6gp?

Already replied to the ToV nodroppedness, I blame outdated websites.

Oh, and some people were wondering where you'd gotten to a coupla days
