Are they vaugely aware there's something called "Everquest" which
makes them money? Probably.

Do they try to meddle in the design in any way? Almost certainly not.

I used to work for a game companty (GameTek). When management showed
up they asked "When the hell is this shipping?" "How much is this
development costing us?" and "How much money are we going to make?"
(As it turns out, the answers were, in order 'Never', 'Lots', and
'None'. the game, BTW, was "Robotech:Crystal Dreams")

What they didn't say was anything along the lines of "Make the
missiles do more damage!" or "Add in that Zentraedi ship, it's my
favorite!"

And no one at Sony corporate HQ is sending memos fifty steps down the
corporate ladder to say "Nerf wizards".
