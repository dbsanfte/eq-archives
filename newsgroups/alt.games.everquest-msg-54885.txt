This just reminds me, EQ has turned me into a cat hater. It started
with the goddamn cheapo attack-the-sitting-guy lions in east karana.
Then the never-say-die tigers in Ill Omen. Topped off with the most
annoying of all, the almost invisible always aggro sow speed panthers
in WL who would interrupt me while quad kiting armors.

I don't care if I'm a druid, as far as I'm concerned cats in EQ are
*not* animals to be protected anymore.
