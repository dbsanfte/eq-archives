Well I'd say that's pretty much a given, as the knowing what some
arbitrary person means by that would require exceptional skill at
mindreading.

Judging by message board traffic, many "ubers" seem to think that
casual is synonymous with lazy, selfish, "wants everything for
free", and "not cool like me".  (I won't get into what I think of
those particula maroons other than to mention that it's an even
less complimentary picture than their attempted smear of casual
players).

Some folks seem to think that casual means "not in a raid guild",
but I've known powergamers (very non-casual) who wouldn't touch a
raiding guild with a ten-foot pole, and raiders who were very
casual in their playing habits most of the time.

Some folks seem to think casual means "doesn't play as much as a
raider", but I've known many casual players (including myself)
who spend as much or more time ingame as many highend raiders.

Casual means a lot of different things to a lot of different
players.  It's not well defined.  It's not clearly focused.  In
fact, that leads to what may be the best overall description that
fits most "casual" players.  We're not obsessed with well-defined
goals and focused in our pursuit thereof.  Casual EQ play is the
antithesis of serious, focused, goal-oriented play.

One last thing, please don't mistake me for one who thinks that
"serious play" is an oxymoron.  At one time or another I have
been quite serious about music, chess, and bridge, and I had a
lot of fun being serious about those things.  But wargaming and
rpging have always been casual pursuits for me, once I feel I am
able to play a game reasonably well I become far more interested
in the "fun of the moment" than any longer term goals.
