Fortunately, once you get an elysian BP you'll look less creepy (if you were
on my server I'd help you get it, I need to go back and see if I'm l33t
enough to quad elysians;  FWIW I hate quadding, except as a test of "Can I
do this?").

I only wish I wasn't such a lazy bastard that I keep my Elysian tunic bagged
in favor of the Jolly Green Giant BP (thurg quest bp), stats and look on
elysian is superior, but the green bp has clickable group regrowth
(15hp/tick for 9 min).

FOR THE LOVE OF TUNARE, GIVE US DRUIDS ARMOR THAT ISN'T GREEN OR BROWN!
(PoM armor is like pepto-bismol color, but it's unique at least... now,
who's gonna run me through NToV for some pink pants?)

Of course, I only porcupine in a few places (velks spiders, sebilis
froggies, and lame green stuff that's immune to snare, have done a shroom in
fungus grove but exp there sucks anus, so does loot), and when I do I
usually end up casting replenishment and NR instead (replenishment -
25hp/tick for 19 min, doesn't stack with regrowth; Nature's recovery -
30hp/tick for 3 min, stacks with nearly anything), add to that my 38 pt DS,
and my lame 11% haste belt, and I'm flinging those crystalline spiders all
over the place! (my stronghorn's horn proc's knockback, and I've had it land
on nearly anything, really confuses people when that big red wurm in ToV
goes flying 20 feet.)  For reference, unless you're insane, porcupining is
only so-so compared to root/dot, but root/dot doesn't work too well in
velks, spiders break/resist root a lot, so I just DS/regen up, snare, dot,
and melee; if I get down around 30% hp or so I root it, back off and iCH
myself; can usually get the heal off before root breaks.  I disturb people
by doing this, they're like "what class are you?!!?!?!?"  "druid" "why are
you tanking??" "because I can", it's hilarious.

Anyways, if you work on your faction (and bank account) you can buy a
skyshrine leather hat MQ (8 ac 3 str 3 dex 10 wis 15 mana 3 sv disease/cold
5 sv magic) for decent prices (I paid 3k for mine), you really need to get a
thurg or ss bracer MQ though (paid 3k for thurg bracer about 9 months ago,
5k for ss bracer about a month ago), ES arms are so... level 46.

Back on headgear though, there's also Bellow's Crafted Cap from Plane of
Innovation, not sure on price, but it's fairly common, so I wouldn't pay
more than 2k or so, it has no graphic (from what I've heard anyways) and
nice stats (9 ac 5 dex 5 sta 6 wis 15 hp 30 mana)
