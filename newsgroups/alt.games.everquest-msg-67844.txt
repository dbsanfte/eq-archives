My only guess there is that what you're saying is the exception of how some
players can get by on 128MB RAM.  If WinXP uses 110MB and Win98 uses 30MB
then what WinXP feels like on 256MB is probably what Win98 would be like on
about 160MB (64/64/32).

As for me on the upgrade thing, I'm still using my VooDoo3 3500 AGP 16MB
video card with only 256MB RAM (Win98).  I'll soon add another 256 MB RAM
(so I'll have 256/128/128) but waiting as long as I can for the video card
upgrade, or at least until I get a true answer of how the ATI All-in-wonder
Radeon works in the game.
