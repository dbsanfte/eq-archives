Mairelon,

Care to discuss this for a bit?  Not being hostile, just curious - because
my experience is quite different.

Not fighting raid mobs, but in a long-term EXP grind, I find that my mage
friends kick my butt in damage output.  A recent example would be a
four-hour session we had in the Pit in Tactics.  I assume you've fought in
the Pit - there's never a lack of mobs to pull (or walk up!), our enchanter
had at least one if not two parked constantly.  Mana regen was VoQ; I have
FT3, mage had FT5.  Other mana regen included a necro in group using Mind
Wrack on any and all casters.  If she was using Pet Canni, I didn't notice
(and I think I would have).  I have SCM and SCF maxed out; I believe she
does too.  Since Tactics is indoor, no horses.  Our tank was excellent, so
we could sit right after the nuke hit.

I found that I could drop about 3K damage per mob sustained; I fluctuated
between 70 and 90 mana, which is my comfort zone.  I don't know what her
manabar was like - but she hit each mob with two of those 2K bolts mages get
at 61 every time, and had no problem modrodding the cleric when requested.
So she was averaging 4K to my 3K per mob, plus pet damage.  The only time
she didn't nuke a mob was when she went AFK to feed her kids & cat.

I've always believed that when it came to damage, wizards are sprinters
(fast damage) where mages are marathon runners (not as fast, but huge damage
over duration).  What experiences can you relate showing that you are being
outdamaged by wizards?
