I want to reply to the post "Where are all the mobs
in Maru Seru" in "Training Grounds" section.
I click on reply,a window opens asking
for my Station password,I fill it in,a "reply to message"
window opens,I write my reply ,click submit button,but 
message does not show up in thread list!?

In case that matters here is the post,I know its not
too friendly.  :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd attempt to post the message,cant see my 1st post,
I dont know why.

Just checked MS with my Ranger,track shows 90% of the
mobs are below surface,it has been this way for months now,
but it is more important to fix "Plane of Time instancing" - lol.
Not to speak of Mons Letalis,Hoppers there have been below
surface since launch of Luclin, but I guess it is more
important to fix "Plane of Time instancing" - lol.

For me this means,I can NOT play the game the way I want,
this raises the question,why I should pay for a service,
I cannot use.

I am running out of patience,and wonder if they will launch
another expansion without fixing this BUG.
Any official word about this BUG would be nice.
