    Ment has a point. VI has no problem "nerfing " any class at any time.
Yes, I read VI's
statement about these "flaws" going on to long - but there are SO MANY other
game play
issues in EQ right now that should have been a priority.  How many broken
quests are there?
How about the lag in ToV?

Right now it's
all about putting in more time sinks into the game. Every one of the
expected
nerfs is meant to simply bring about more downtime. I cancelled my
pre order on PoP.
