Sigh. Whatever the word, you have my attention :)

Sounds like the information you saw there was based on high hopes, and
has never been corrected. This is unusual at EQTraders - the Den
Mother is usually a stickler for accuracy.

I'm afraid the answer is that, to the best of my knowledge, you cannot
add pigment to tailored items. It does work with certain smithed
armors, but you'll have to look elsewhere for that information - I'm
not about to start a smithing guide!

I say "to the best of my knowledge" because there may well be
undiscovered recipes out there yet.

Sorry, that can indeed be misleading. The Robe pattern that you get in
Velious, well, no one has yet found a recipe that works for it.
Frankly, we don't know what the damned thing is for.

The pattern you need is the Tunic pattern, which is readily found all
over the place. Combined with the appropriate ingredients, this will
indeed make a robe, despite being a tunic pattern.

>And does the same thing apply to sandals (vs. boots), etc.?

The way to approach the patterns is to look at the body part they go
on, not what they're called. For example, the shoulderpad pattern
makes shouulderpads, a mantle, or an amice. The tunic pattern makes a
tunic, a robe, a gi. And so on. It just depends what ingredients
you're mixing with it.

Good luck!
