Its not really that complicated, nor its really so much "RP" as you seem to
think. And this is why its confusing you. Its more accurate to say that
these players refuse to 'exploit' the existence of much higher level
players... for a variety of reasons.

Exploit you say? Yes. Exploit. In what other game can you have access to
equipment from levels and creatures far beyond your own, except by somehow
cheating.

Now the reasons.
1) Ironman players. These people want to do it on their own, with no help
from anyone. Often these people have high level mains... they *know* they
can 'beat the game', and they know that if they gave their little lowbie
some uber crap they could breeze through anything and powerlevel like
nuts... but they want to see if they can actually do it without the help.

2) Purists. These people want to play everquest 'for the first time'. They
want to recreate to the best of their ability the challenges and hardships
that the first batch of players encountered. They're willing to accept buffs
from players their level down, they'll engage in the economy with items
attainable by their level down and so on. In their 'ideal world view' there
isn't anyone higher level to twink them, to buff them, recover their
corpses. They want to recreate the pioneering spirit...

3) Sportsmen. These people don't want to attack Emperor Crush using weapons
dropped from 59th level mobs while buffed by 59th level players because it
simply takes all the sport out of it. These are the people who like to hunt
game with bows instead of semiautomatic rifles... one good way to preserve
the 'sportingness' of the EQ is to play it with weapons and buffs no better
than what they can obtain at their level, from their own effort. (ie Looting
hi-level corpses for items isn't terribly sporting...) These people are also
likely to get bored easily if their life isn't in danger... to them a
perfectly controlled camp is an indication that its time to move on.

4) True RP... These people have their own various visions of their
characters. They'll use 1HB instead of 1HS no matter how much better off
they'd be with 1HS...or they'll use a shield instead of 2H... and a million
other permutations of arbitrary rules (including possibly 'not using
bought/charity' items/buffs). These folks are relatively rare.

5) Other... I'm sure there other categories. And I'm sure there is a lot of
overlap, and hybrids too... people who subscribe to one or more of the above
mentalities, but aren't extremists.

Why do people play like this? Because for them it heightens the fun. They
**already know** they could simply go out and hunt easy blues / greens and
then return to the bazaar another level higher with enough cash for a new
item. But the idea of doing that for 60 levels bores them to tears,
regardless of how 'optimal' it is. Because if they do this they'll never
have a reason to hunt griffons in NK, or take out Najena, or do the great
majority of quests... until the endgame it will always be more 'optimal' to
farm some easy cash/xp and then go shopping in the bazaar.

Everquest is a horridly designed game, in that it rewards players the most
for doing easy repetitive tasks. (Except at the very endgame, where to your
exp is capped and you've got enough AAs to fill a boat, when all thats left
to do is raid extremely difficult mobs for chances at better equipment.) For
everybody else the optimal course of action is to find a hi blue fast
spawning camp that you can control, with periodic shopping trips at the
bazaar.

These so-called 'RPers' are simply taking the matter into their own hands,
and have made everquest challenging and fun by giving themselves events that
are as varied, difficult, and potentially 'rewarding' [insofar as they can
improve their equipment from it] as 'high level raids' at all levels of the
game. I don't think they merit any criticisim for it and in fact should be
encouraged.

Because these are the people that later have long lasting good memories of
organizing a group to take out Emperor Crush with Bronze weapons, or
cracking Blackburrow, or dropping Najeena... not the blip that is 'oh yeah I
took Crush with some uber loots and Chloroplast while a 59th level druid who
was factioning kept our back... hehehe... i didn't even know it was him
until we were looting corpses...'.  Some people have more fun the first
way... others have more fun the 2nd way... both should be legitimate ways to
play. Personally I'd have more fun playing the first way...how you play is
up to you.

Its not RP that makes people play like this (mostly) its simply its a more
fun way to play for a lot of people.
