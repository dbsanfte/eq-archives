I wish I had never seen a cleric who was enough of a space cadet as to
be oor for an assist, but sadly...and yes, the Wonder Bird is a fun
encounter....oy....

No problem.  ;)

I would agree with this under normal circumstances.  However, the
other day we were back-flagging, doing Grummus, and a recruit was
asked to MGB EE when the AOE hit.  Unfortunately, he thought that the
MT's engagement hot button meant that it had hit, despite the lack of
damage message or dot landing. /groan.  He hit MGB EE before anyone
had lost ANY health at all.

With us, we usually have about 7 clerics on.  At least two are left
out of rotation for spot heals and EE if needed.

I admire your guild's philosophy and share it.  My guild got by for a
very long time with a couple of 2-boxers because on my server, playing
a cleric seems to burn a person out faster than any other class, so
there are a dearth of them.  Now we have a decent corral, and my guild
is overjoyed that this is the case.  Two-boxers are mere utility now -
they do things that the single box clerics should be wasting mana on
(buffs for people who died or missed MGB, etc.)

Because of human error, the 1.8 second pause actually takes longer
than that - but that's why it's 1.8 instead of 2.5, to allow for that
to happen.

Our rotations seem to generally have 5 clerics, or four if we're
pinched for some reason.

Xegony is a terrible, endless fight...I can't wait until we get to her
again. :)

We test them to see what they can do.  I will not say that a mediocre
ckleric has never made it through the recruiting process; there's no
way to catch EVERYONE.  However, clerics are the oen class for which
we are always recruiting, so we get a certain amount of freedom of
choice.  As I said above, it wasn't always this way, but if a cleric
doesn't meet standard, he or she probably won't last.

I agree here.  As part of recruitment, a cleric is educated as to his
or her mistakes (at least I was :)  and is given a chance to correct
them and learn.  The clerics in my guild are not seen as being
dispensible - there is a sense of inclusion to my guild that sometimes
lacks in the so-called "uber" guilds, that no one will be left behind.
 If you are worthy to be in the guild, you're worthy of the effort it
takes to get you flagged.

Of course, these days enough clerics are flagged that we don't have to
do the trials with them anymore - just the big raid mobs. :)

I'll close by saying this, and it's all opinion - any guild that would
take a 2-boxed cleric over a single boxer because it's easier to get
them and they're "just as good" will get a rude awakening when they
get to Time and are doing 18-person encounters.  Not going to be able
to afford a 2-box at that point - those encounters are rumored to
require FULL attention.
