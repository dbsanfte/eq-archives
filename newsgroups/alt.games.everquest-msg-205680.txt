Go to Trak's Teeth, where odds are there's someone killing the froglok forager
and hunter to spawn nameds.

Each drops a fairly nice "no drop" bow, which rots, because A) anyone hunting
these already has better if they are interested or B) already has one if they
have the slightest interest, and since they are no drop there's no use picking
up another even if they aren't lore, which I think they are.  The bows drop
-every- time.

While you are there, also get a medallion off each of the two mobs and run it
over to the emperor.  Getting to him is a bit scary but once inside his tunnel
any undead you got on your tail will break off pursuit as though you zoned.
This way you can also have your seb key, which is fun when LFG.

/ooc level 5 ranger LFG, have seb key

While I'd be prouder of the bow you made yourself, I don't think you can really
say "Cheaper and better bow will not be had at low levels."

Under level 10 you only risk a trip back to your bind spot (I'd bind at
soulbinder in POK)... and the main danger will be coming down the cliffs in EJ.
I'd reccomend the stairs.
