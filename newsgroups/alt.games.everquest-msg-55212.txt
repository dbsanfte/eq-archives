Yep, it really installs nothing to the registry which is the way
programs should be ;) What I do is backup my entire 950 meg or
something EQ dir to 2 cdroms every so often, that way even if I format
and clean my hardrive I can just dump all the files back into a dir
for EQ and change them from selecting all to not "read only."

Its far faster to patch up that way than reinstalling the whole thing.
