Balancing risk/reward is something everyone is taught to
do, and there's nothing a game can do to change that, IMO.
That said, I - and most of the people I know - don't "minimize"
the risk.   I've consistently chosen areas where the targets
were at least high blue, and white or yellow for groups (or
high blues where consistent multiple pulls were expected.)
Most of the people I've met do the same.   Do they take on
red mobs, at least intentionally?  No, the "tombstone" warning
seems to be enough, unless you're talking about raid-type
experiences.

Just MHO, but if it's dull, you're not doing something right.
When a location gets dull for me, it's time to move on, XP
be damned.

Well, I'd say the biggest problem long-term is the change in
the game itself as you continue to advance in levels.   At
some point, the casual player simply plays himself out of
the game.   EQ offers enough variation in classes that there's
some "replay" value, but I don't know how long that will last.
