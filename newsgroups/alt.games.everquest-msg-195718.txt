Didn't require a friend teaching you, just a friend to explore the
game with you.  When you're collabarating with somebody else then all
of the "hard" things you work your way past become a big part of the
fun of it.  I won't argue about it being hard, Kaev had a terrible
time just keeping himself in food and drink until about L5, and I had
some sort of nearly insurmountable mental block that kept me from
understanding how to "swim", even when being told exactly what to do
(which part of "look up" I didn't understand remains a mystery to me).

I learned smithing before there were useful guides, learned lots of
detailed tactics that no longer apply (remember when root overwrote
snare?), did lots of stupid things and a few smart things, and
generally had a great time in the months it took to become "high"
level (i.e. L20+ to most of us ignorant newbies back then).  I doubt
mosts players today have half as much fun on their way to 50 as we
had just getting to 20 back then.
