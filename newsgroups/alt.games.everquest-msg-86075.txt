It was obviously account guild sharing.
I'm really sick of people saying "hack" in place of "I was an idiot
and shared account info." It makes it sound like there is some
security danger which does not exist.

Yep, the owners were not wise at all. They also had it coming to them
basically. You don't give some 15 year old kid you barely know the
keys to your house or car in real life so don't give them your EQ info
just because you are in the same guild.

If you share account info with anyone, you are basically saying to
them "fine, destroy my character in anyway you want and even steal it
and I'll have to sort it out later I guess."
