If they actually need the training, they won't know what buffs they could 
have in a PL situation... :)

Well, you don't have to be uber, you just have to be higher level than the 
mark.  Say, a group of 8's training a level 5.  I was also assuming that 
thetrainers were doing it to be charitable, mostly, since it means they're 
increasing the odds of them having a well-informed groupmate at some later 
date.
