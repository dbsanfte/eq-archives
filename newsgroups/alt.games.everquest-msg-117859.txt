No local servers, but the US ones seem good enough anyway. Latency is 
not as important as other action games such as Quake. If you use an ISP 
which routes to the US via the Southern Cross then you would hardly 
notice the difference in EQ from being in the US anyway!

The Everquest Gold pack was released in Australia a few weeks ago. It 
includes Everquest plus all three expansions, posters and a mousemat 
(its a pretty crappy mousemat though).

It retails for $AU100. You can also buy just the original Everquest for 
$AU30.

I would suggest getting the gold pack because EQ is so addictive you 
will end up buying it later anyway!
