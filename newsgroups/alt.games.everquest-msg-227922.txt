The article is very anti EQ and pro pretrammel UO but despite that he
is talking about the very same malaise I've been mentioning that are
plaguing mmorpgs for years now. The seesaw battle between mmorp
"world" vs mmorp "game". And right now the "game" side is winning and
thats causing most the trouble with crap mmorpgs coming out, along
with the "dumbing down" as people put it in EQ - where convenience >
all.
