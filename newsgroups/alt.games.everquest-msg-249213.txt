It would seem that a solution to this would be to use the capability EQ
now has to flag a character and to add "Representatives of the Gods" or
"Planar beings" at the top and bottom of each stone, and in order to get
flagged you can either hail the NPC at the bottom, you can perform a
non-trivial, level appropriate quest given by the NPC at the top, OR
every 5/10 levels you acquire a free flag to the zone of your choice.

Note: I am not currently playing, but I am still actively addicted to
the NG, and am playing ~every 6-8 months just to keep active, I have all
expansions except LDoN and GoD.  I will likely postpone my regularly
scheduled play month until the graphic bugs are worked out... Oh and
until recently my account was on ice for over 2 years... everything
survived..
