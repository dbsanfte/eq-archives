Agree on that one. When my troll was camping the WC Toll Booth (tried to 
tell people in the zone that it was now the Troll Booth and they should 
pay toll to me, but no luck), we saved the newbies that came running.

BUT we only took the mobs the guards would normally help with. Some guy 
saw us helping newbies, and appearantly thougth that this was his time 
to try and kill Kizdean Gix.
He of course shout at us after dying why we didnt help him, and we 
explained that the guards dont aggro on Kizdead (my poor wood elf found 
out by painful experience), and that we would get faction hits (bad for 
us trolles that wanna be able to go into Neriak) if we killed him.


So help the newbies with the mobs that the guards usually kill, dont be 
a buffer to kill all in zone they can drag to you.
