Oh, I must have imagined all the Fillipinos that were working there.  I must
have imagined talking to them, and finding out that they did, in fact,
practice their own religion there.  For the record, that was January of
2001.  I spent a week there while I was waiting for a plane to take me out
of the Arabian Gulf, as I transferred from the Truman to the Reagan.  Ok,
I've been there, I've seen it.  There was a very heavy Fillipino influence
in Manama.  Go ahead, try to tell me I'm wrong.

Taking all the religious arguments going on as a whole, I'm pretty sure Dave
is on your side.
