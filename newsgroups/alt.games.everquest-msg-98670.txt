Yeah, probably not -- after all, it's great to find a
nice item and/or a good price, but what good does it
do if the buyer and seller are on opposite sides of
the "world"?

The nice thing about EC is that you go there when you
want to buy/sell.  The buyer/seller *will* be in the
zone or you won't hear their auction.  It's nearly
immediate gratification.

Except for the ultra, 00b3r items, I would not think
that EC will get replaced by "global" chat channels
simply due to porting issues.  Plus, what happens if
you spend all kinds of time/plat porting and you
get to the agreed meeting place only to find that the
other party "got distracted" and won't complete the
deal?  Ugh!
