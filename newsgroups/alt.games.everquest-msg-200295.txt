ya know, a year ago I started playing this game.  A friend of mine 
suggested that I try, so I bought a copy  (Trilogy) and created my first 
ever char--a paladin.  Got him to level 10 (mostly) solo, with MINIMAL 
help.  And all the help I did get was from people suggesting stuff as I 
died at their feet! :)

To the point:  I hated the new UI when they brought it out.  I despised 
the fact that they eventually MADE me use it.  Then I started moving 
things around, customizing the look, so to speak, and adjusted the fade 
levels of the windows (or whatever you call it).  Got rid of the windows 
I didn't need.  Moved them around a bit to give myself the greatest 
amount of clear area in the center of the screen.

Guess what?  The damned thing has started to grow on me.  I even d/l'd a 
few custom UI files (gotta love that part of the new UI!).  A learning 
curve?  Yeah, but more just getting used to the visual aspect of it.

That pally has long since been retired (only made it to 14 before being 
deleted), and a rogue took his place...until I started a Wizard a while 
back.  I know have 2 active characters and 3 part timeers (mules, high 
CHA purchaser, and a level 1 shaman that never left the guiild hall!).

What's all this mean?  Even if you go solo in the game, /ooc some 
suggestions, try to find a group, and HAVE FUN!  I could have been 
furthur alongwith all my chars, but seem to need to take the time to 
simply, oh I don't know, PLAY in the game.  Kill stuff that I can drop in 
a single hit.  walk up to someone struggling with a mob, let them get it 
to less than 50% health, and BAM! nuke it with my wizard.  Just for fun.  
You don't just have to do the xp grind, ya know.

Final thought:  you get from the game what you put into it.  Want fun?  
Then just have fun.  Want xp?  Then forget how long it takes and start 
taking down the blues and whites (or group for yellows and reds).  Want 
some online friends?  Then be sociable.   Pretty much easy to do.  And if 
you get tired/bored, screw around with trade skills or /ooc some funny 
shit, just to get a response.   Makes it easier.

Or, just leave the game.  The world of Norrath will continue, with or 
without you.  If ya don't like it, good and fine...just don't dog a game 
you haven't given much of a chance.

That's all I got to say about that.
