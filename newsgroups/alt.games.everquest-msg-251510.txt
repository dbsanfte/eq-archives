Could solo dungeons work?  There are many classes that do no solo well.
Rogue, for example.  If a rogue takes a solo dungeon, how would they tune
it to be doable?  Have a bunch of mobs that have low HP for their level, and
are arranged so that the rogue can get to them one at a time out of aggro
range of the others to get a big backstab in, and then melee before getting
hurt badly?  Have the NPC that gives the mission also give the rogue some
special twink gear that is NO RENT and only works in the dungeon?

The same goes for many classes.  Even some that solo well outside (like
Wizards) would be problematical in a dungeon.
