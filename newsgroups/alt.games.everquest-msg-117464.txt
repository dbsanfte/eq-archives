I am a Druid and my Evocation Specialization is 196 (man it goes slow up
there).  I did not get evocation initially and had to do the quest to
Soluesk Ro - easy quest but cost you a ruby which from the vendor cost me
183pp and that hurt like hell at level 30!

It is hard to tell what specialization is winning the race.  MAYBE (my
memory aint what it used to be) if you go to a trainer and select the
specialization he will give the name.  All your specializations should stop
at Below Average (50) except the winner which can go to 250.

What I did after the reset quest was to blast myself with my lowest
evocation spell (Burst of Fire I think) and then med up.  I was afraid to
cast heal - cause another 183pp would have killed me.

Good Luck
Jocund
Druid 41, Firiona Vie
