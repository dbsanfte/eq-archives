One generalization leads to another, Ben, and neither are entirely accurate.

You know, I actually roleplay my ranger as a soloist as best I can, though
the current environment makes it more difficult than it needs to be.  I
don't want stuff handed to me just because I put in the time.  I don't want
solo LDoNs ... if I did, I'd do the same thing in Anarchy Online.  All I
want to be able to do is roleplay the way I choose to.

My way of roleplaying the ranger is as the lone wolf sort of character who
only comes in to town when low on provisions ... usually fletching supplies
... then goes back out and tried to scratch out a living by going places
where he has no business being and trying to make things happen.

Death happens when you roleplay this way.  I don't know how many times the
ranger has died in 53 levels, but I can count the rezzes on one hand and
have four fingers left over.

But now at 53, I'm finding it impossible to continue to roleplay in this
fashion.  The ends no longer justify the means.  So I must abandon my
character's personna, not by choice, but out of a necessity which was caused
by the faceless "Powers That Be".  The once proud, self reliant ranger now
runs around meekly begging for groups.

That just stinks, IMO.
