I've gotten used to having to alt-enter before hitting enter at the
password screen.  At that point, Zonealarm (free version) would freeze
up the computer as it sees the patched program as new.  It would have
a popup box where you would need to check off something, but you
couldn't see that if you were in full screen mode.  I would alt-enter
at that point to go into windowed mode and check said box.

Now, after the 6/11 patch, if I hit alt-enter at any point leading up
to there the game crashes to desktop.  Even worse, my EQMAIN.DLL file
is corrupted, so I have to delete it, the eqclient.ini, and the
eqgame.exe files.

Is anyone else crashing to desktop if they alt-enter at any point
before the login screen?  I don't want to disable Zonealarm, and have
granted full permission to all EQ related files.  I don't recall any
tab that has a "changes frequently" option... must be the pay version
of Zonealarm.

Thanks
