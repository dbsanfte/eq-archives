Come talk to me again after you've done Uqua and some of the other "hellish"
GoD raids, or my recent favorite hellish encounter, Jelvan.  The humor in
this statement won't hit you until you do.  =)

Commonly heard in guildchat before or after a raid:  "Anyone up for a DoN?"

DoN produces upgrades for everyone, not just non-raiders.  I have probably
10 augments from DoN myself.  The raiders have to build up their faction the
same way to be able to do the progression raids.  And, quite simply, as the
newest place to grind it is generally the most popular, and therefore
easiest to find a group, place to grind.

Creator is a simple mission with a high payout.  I do suggest trying others,
as some are rather creative (even the Creator mission is creative...  the
first time).

I did mention that it was an exercise in the highest possible single-group
hp gear.  Beyond that, though, read what you wrote there.  "If not, what do
you need all that HP for anyway?"

Think on that a bit and you may realize that you actually agree with me.

Actually, I think 4 or 6 items, all augments, are what drop in Riftseekers. 
A large portion of that gear is DoN, KT, Ikkinz single group trials, PG
single group trials, etc.  And interestingly enough, *I* could use all the
RS augments on that magelo, because I have none.  I'm just not much of a
grinder.

Another thing I stated in the aforementioned parallel discussion is you'd
have to be an idiot to spend the time and effort to get the single-group
magelo's worth of gear without seriously investigating the option of joining
a raiding guild.  That magelo represents grinding, grinding, grinding,
camping, grinding, grinding, grinding, camping, grinding, camping, and
grinding some more.  At least for me, grinding gets old quick.

Nor with my cheap ass refusal to pay to be "authentic".

Because I didn't consider it imbalanced back then either, when the gap was
much larger.  =)

Maybe I'm just a strange duck (well, no "maybe" about that...).  I've always
been proud of my gear and what I've achieved.  I've never been the best
equipped monk around.  I don't find the two concepts mutually exclusive. 
Hell, I think I was actually closer to being the number one equipped monk
back then than I am now.  The server merger dropped me waaaay down the list,
as my server simply didn't have all that many monks, and the server I got
merged with had tons.

I think they call paraphrasing like that "literary license".  =P

I think we are all aware that loot whores come in all playstyles.  =)

I'd say the majority of players are raiders of some sort, all with something
to look forward to and strive for, regardless of how long their individual
playstyles may make them take to get there.  There doesn't seem to be a
large percentage of people that *never* raid, though I'm sure there are
some.

Someone that raids once a month is still a raider.  Is still working toward
getting multi-group-acquired upgrades.  Yeah, the "hardcore" raiders may
scoff a bit, but that's to be expected.  If you play golf and work your
score down from 110 to 95, there's still gonna be a golf pro snickering at
you.  =)  The trick is, of course, to ignore that and enjoy your own
accomplishment standing on its own.
