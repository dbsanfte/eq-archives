As opposed to doing it WHILE MEDITATING?  When my Druid starts
getting low on mana I stack fewer DoTs and end up getting plus
mana for a kill.  You tell me how a Ranger shooting arrows is
half as unbalanced as Root/Dotting.  Try playing 50 or more
levels as a real melee (most emphaticly NOT a Beastlord) and
then reread what you just posted.
