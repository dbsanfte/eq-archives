What a bunch of jerkoffs. Pull you head out of your asses and go mow the
lawn/ wash the car/ kiss you wife/ do your homework/ feed the cat/ ride
you bike/ call your friend/ walk around the block/ do the dishes/ get a
haircut/ go to work/ or ANYTHING ELSE!! Just wake the fcuk up and live in
the real world. Do you know how lame you are being? How many of you have
spent enough time playing this sh!tass game that you could have earned a
college degree or something real and useful? WAKE UP!!!!
