As I remember from soloing my necro, scouts became trivial at 44 and
greened out at 46. There are several spots to isolate them, even for
fear-kiting, but behind the fort in GD is the best. Pull from the fort
and the surrounding countryside to the flat area between the fort and
the mountain behind it.

47 is a tough level to XP off of giants at. Berserkers will be
reasonable XP and not too hard to kill. Once you get to 49, you should
be able to handle Elites, which are mostly dark blue all the way to
60.
