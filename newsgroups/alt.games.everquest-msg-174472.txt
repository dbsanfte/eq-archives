Er, the US is the single biggest producer of pollution in the whole 
round world. The US reducing, even unilaterally, its own emissions would 
unarguably benefit the world as a whole, but yes, it would hurt American 
interests.

I think that their own core of techophobe eco-taliban extremists are 
much more of a threat to the environmental movement than any connection 
to socialism. And the connection between environmentalism and the left 
isn't clear-cut. It may be working in Germany, but I don't remember the 
USSR or China ever giving a shit about environmental issues....

In this particular instance, I'm not talking about the arms reduction 
treaties that the US may or may not be refusing to sign, to which it's 
perfectly entitled; I'm talking about the ones already signed (because, 
obviously, were considered good at the time), and is getting out of now (
for reasons, in my view, more related to pork and defense contracts than 
security). Sorry if I wasn't clear enough.
