It's different in a very meaningful way.  Sorry, but I just don't see him
saying that it is "insane not to have KEI" as him trying to insult you.
You're just being extremely thin-skinned and taking personal a statement
that was not meant that way.  Then taking anyone who agreed with him about
you and lumping them together to insult really hurts your argument even
further.
