I used real e-mail addy in here for awhile.  I've used newsgroups for quite
some time now, but never used my real addy.  I don't know why I had set it
up to use it this time, probably just foolishly using a little faith.
Anyway, I started getting all kinds of spam from foreign countries.  Get
rich quick schemes, etc.  One that was particularly bothering me was some
scam originating from the Phillipines selling "diplomas" from "prestigious,
non-accredited colleges".  Yes, that is exactly how it was worded.  The part
that bothered me was they were coming in like crazy, I couldn't even block
the sender because they would come to me with the sender field empty.  I
forwarded each one to AT&T's abuse addy, only to get apologies from AT&T
saying they didn't know how an empty addy was filtering through their
system.
Anyway, they kept coming and I dialed the number so I could find out just
who was sending this horse shit.  It was an american phone # though I knew
from the accent and rather odd message that this was merely a remote
answering service.
Then the phone calls started...stupid me!
As soon as I said "I know this is a scam, stop fucking calling me and take
me off your mailing list" the miserable badger on the other end started
trying to explain it's not a scam, yada-yada.  I informed her that I'm not
an idiot and I want to be taken off any e-mail and calling lists they may
have.
"Yes, I will take you off immediately.  Have a good day, sir.", she said.
"OK, right now?  I'll be off your mailing lists?"
"Yes, sir.  Have a good day." she replied.
"What is my email address?" I bitched at her.
She started stammering and said she was only a phone-jockey.  I told her I'm
not that stupid and I've been forwarding all of their e-mails to my ISP's
abuse system and to the Better Business Bureau.
That's what she started swearing at me, telling me there's not a fucking
thing I can do, fuck you American, blah, blah, blah...
I simply stated that at least most Americans are too smart to fall for such
a pathetic scam, called her a dirty Philipino goat-fuck, and hung up.
No more phone calls, but a couple e-mails.  AT&T managed to at least tag the
name this time, but was always different (go figure).

Spam free for 4 months and loving it,
SEAN...
