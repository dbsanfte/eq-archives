So? I can instantly find where I am on a paper map. If they didn't want 
you to know where you were in the game they wouldn't have /loc to begin 
with. I don't care if it IS a carryover from beta or whether it was 
added last week. Verant gives you that tool... they can't dictate HOW it 
should be used. Verant gives you the opportunity to modify the screen 
colors, etc. using the .ini file.... does that mean if I use any of the 
tools out there to do it (besides the in-game tools) that it's 
considered a "cheat"? The same could carry over to parsing the log file 
then. Why give us these tools and turn around and say HOW they can be 
used. Following the letter of the law (in-game and out) is NOT always 
the best course of action.
