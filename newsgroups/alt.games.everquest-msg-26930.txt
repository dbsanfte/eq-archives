I heard someone petitioned it and a GM said, "Yea, that is stupid" and
changed it to "Bigole Titties" to comply with his concept of a fantasy
setting.

Well, actually I didn't hear that. I wouldn't be supprised if I started
hearing things like that. It is the future of MMO.

I have one stupid named character. Wish I had it to do over again. Chose an
adjective as a first name so there is no way to chose a last name w/o it
creating a more perfect stupid. I know it is a stupid name because a dewd
came up to me and said "hehe, kewl name".

You know, you just can't get it right after you give your character a first
name like Red or Early or Hot. You just start going into "Red Dawn" no that
was a silly movie, "Red Scare" no that was a political witch hunt, "Early
Riser" well almost, "Hot Stuff" eww I need a shower.

It is a lesson learned. I be staying away from adjectives from here on.
