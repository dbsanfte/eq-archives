Your raw atk score is the only thing that determines chances of hit
(compared against enemy ac table). And the amount of dammage done by a hit
(percentage table for your classX ratio of weapon + set amount)

A higher atk will cause you to see less misses and when you hit you will do
higher dammage.

Atk is made up primarily by your weapon skill, str, buffs, and equipment.
Equipment atk is the hardest to get and is capped at 250 raw atk from
equipment in the same way ft is capped at 15. Most melee in time will have
atk from equipment capped just as most casters in time will have ft capped.
(Ft actually easier to get I think)

Atk can be deceptive because weapon dammage is hard capped for some levels
and there is a soft floor , ie you can only ever be so bad no matter what ac
you are fighting. Chances are if you are seeing no extra hits from higher
atk scores than you are below the soft floor.

P.S> caveat ! this is primarily from secondary sources and they could be
lying :p If you have seen evidence that only skill and skill improving
equipment effect your chances to hit then share it ! It certainly does not
mesh with what the 2200 atk person told me.
