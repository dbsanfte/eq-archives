Not quite, I was saying it was equipped in offhand weapon slot up
-until- "extreme endgame" (by which I mean up into the rarified
air past tier 3 POP, not necessarily all the way to Time and
back); A) not necessarily as a weapon and B) not to say that it
isn't eventually superceded by some extreme endgame gear, rather
that until you -get- said extreme endgame gear its still used.  

Of course the confusion is going both directions, to me "bag it"
doesn't mean put it in a bag to carry around, it means "put it in
the (trash) bag; to discard or throw away.   Since you meant
"remains sometimes useful and is still carried around" I don't
think I have any objection; if you're in the latter category and
still use your epic in offhand sometimes because of something it
does for you other than haste boost, then you fit right into what
I'm referring to.

Which is lucky, because I personally -don't- know what I'm
talking about here, just referring to things I've heard
guildmates and groupmates and people in various forums say, I
don't really know much about the high end melee game at all.
