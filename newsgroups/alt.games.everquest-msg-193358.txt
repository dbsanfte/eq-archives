PATCH MESSAGE, APRIL 11, 2003
General Fixes

Fixed a problem with "burst" damage causing too much aggro. Attacks that do
a lot of damage in a short time no longer cause more aggro than they should.
Feign Death has been restored to the functionality it had before the patch.
Fixed an issue that caused aggro from damage shields to be assigned
incorrectly.
Removed a bug that could cause certain types of encounters, such as the
Rallos Zek encounter in the Plane of Tactics, to crash a zone.
Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when you tried to bring up the item
display window for bags and notes.


Now... What exactly was the incorrect assignment that was fixed?
