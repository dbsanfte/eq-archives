Walruses on the SW corner of EW are good, though I don't remember if they're
green or not yet, I personally did Bloodgills in LoIO, but they're a bit
advanced and you'd probably die a few times there.  Also, there's some
static spawn tigeraptors in WL near the skyshrine entrance, I quadded those
a bit, the tigeraptors have about 1700 hp, the tigerSAURS have about 2500
and are a bit higher level, you can mix the 2 types in the quad, but you'll
end up wasting mana on the saurs if you have more than 1 at the end and thus
can't root/dot it easily, once again, I don't remember if these were green
yet at 46, I know the saurs weren't, but dont' remember on the raptors.

Go back and do it again, you won't get exp, but you'll get your ooc quadding
skill up (as a player).

Pull with ENsnare, and group them all up, you can even use the level 5 aoe
(heh) to 'test' whether or not they're grouped up tight enough or not, get a
feel of how close they have to be to hit all 4 with the aoe before you go do
it for exp.

DL is the sucks. 'nuff said.

You could probably get a group in Lguk (I did) around those levels, but
definitely purchase some IvU potions first (undead awareness is the proper
potion name), I started in KC around 47 a bit, Sebilis also, but they kept
saying I was too low (and yet they still grouped me... ohhkaay...), might
find a group in Chardok depending on your server.  Velketor's is also good,
started there at 46 (I was the evac ho =P), but I refuse to go there unless
I've got some friends going to dogs (usually lower), because spiders are
just plain fucking boring.

I never did much there, but Dawnshroud Peaks is apparently good also, at the
rockhopper/sambata cave, I only hunted there in the early 30's on the
shrooms (which green out around 37-38), some of the hoppers/sambata are
still blue to 51.

Depending on what clickys you have (IE Warden Symbol, velious bracer/ES
arms, lumi staff) you might be able to solo in various places that it would
be suicidal to try otherwise, many times I've been glad I did the warden
quest and bought ES arms (then upgraded to thurg bracer).  With the warden
symbol and ES arms/velious bracer, basically, assuming you can avoid adds,
and your target doesn't summon (whee luclin), and that root is resisted less
than 50% of the time, you can essentially solo anything, although it might
take a LONG time)

Oops.  I just realized you're a halfling,  no warden symbol for you, but the
ES arm thing still applies.  I can't give you much advice about using a Lumi
staff if you have one though, since I'm too money hungry to pay 8k for one,
and I haven't been back to Seb for a while to see about getting one.
