I actually had to go with the OLDER driver to make me GeForce 2 MX 200 64MB
card work right, if I remember right it was the driver on the
www.everquest.com page. I also had to remove the drivers I was using and set
card to Standard VGA first, THEN updated the drivers w the ones I got from
the EQ link.
Good Luck,
