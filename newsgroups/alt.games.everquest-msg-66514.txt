Whew! Patrick, I'm relieved to read that. I thought it was just me. Yes,
I've locked up with a black screen at that point on several occasions. I
can't alt-tab out, though. I have to power down and start over. Not
every time, mind you. Seems to be a random thing, but I've no clue what
to do about it.

That's the one area where I'm blessed. All last night, Tiru and I were
the fastest zoners in our group by a long shot. I'm getting pretty much
the same zone times as I had pre-SoL. Others in our group took up to two
minutes to zone. Maybe more. We've been hashing it around, and it seems
only those with Intel processors are zoning fast, if all other features
are at nominal levels.

I'm betting on video card, from my experience. I had terrible lag and
stuttering turns until I put in my new GF2 MX 400 video card. (64 MB
RAM). Now the turning, etc. is smooth as ever, even with textures on
high and most character models turned on.
