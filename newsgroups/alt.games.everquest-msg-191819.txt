Logged in this morning to the unpleasantness of a patch.  I know,
its necessary to do this from time to time, but its always
dissapointing to have play time available and see a patch in my
way.  Ah well, knowing full well that it wouldn't be done already
at 8 am eastern, I didn't even try to go further, just waited out
the download and then went on to other things.

Finally just now at 11:12 am EST I gave it a shot.  First off, my
cursor wouldn't move on the "agree/disagree" page, till I
happened to try it with the left button down, this freed it up
from the upper left corner where it was stuck for some reason.
Might be unrelated to the patch of course, but first time I've
seen this happen, so I hope if it happens to anyone else that
this tip helps.

Then I went thru about a dozen tries of the log in, no joy.
Mostly I got the "can't connect" but twice the "server is
congested" message.

So my couple months offline didnt' help, I assume, they -still-
haven't put in a response that actually tells you "we are
currently patching you can't log in yet" relying on their old
false messages about server congestion... worst thing about this
plan is that when the servers do go back up,they actually -are-
congested and it might take a dozen tries to get in... so I'm
stuck with trying this "tell me twelve times" plan to get a good
guess at whether the patch is over yet or not.

Have they put in place any method at all yet of telling when
patch is over?
