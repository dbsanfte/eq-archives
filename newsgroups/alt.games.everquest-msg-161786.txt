The formula changes for trivials 68+.  The formulas are based on a lot of
data collected over time.  Here is what is posted on EQTraders.

Success = Skill - 0.75*Trivial + 51.5 (rounded up, for Trivial>= 68)
Success = Skill - Trivial + 66 (for Trivial < 68)

Minimum success rate is believed to be about 5%.  (I've heard as low as 2 or
3%.)
Maximum success rate is believed to be about 95%.
