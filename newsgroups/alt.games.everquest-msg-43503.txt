I don't know about anyone else but it takes me at most 20 minutes to find a
port somewhere... I don't know if it's just that I'm polite or what... one
word: Location go to local druid rings/wiz spire and shout for a port...
might take a couple minuts but sheesh better than 2+ hours walkin... this is
a fantasy reality... how can you expect to just be able to go anywhere you
want? to much 'give give give' not enough patience... if this game just gave
me everything I wanted I'd quit becuase nothing would be worth anything...
you don't like traveling stay in the zones with porters...
