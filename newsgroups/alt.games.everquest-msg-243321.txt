Im pretty sure the mobs in hate that you pointed out do not do 400dps.

Ya a 60 ranger shouldnt be a wuss vs a 400dps mob? /boggle

Not that it will do 400dps...

Should not have to be that quick on the draw, unless the enchanter is
sitting next to the charmed mob, and it is hasted.

Epic haste = enchanter epic? :) OP wanted drops for mage / ranger.

But yep, the drop rate of SEoC and spawn rate of the named who drop them is
abysmal.  I still dont have mine and have wiped the zone numerous times.
