	That's because there are a few pinheads in the commercial mud business who
are chasing what they see as a holy grail: a mud in which the players generate
the content.  This is, of course, 180 degrees off of what the vast majority of
players want, which is to BE entertained, not to pay for the privledge of
entertaining others.

|You should experience a pvp server,

	I have.  And you know what?  IT SUCKED!

|moreover if you dislike twinks and uber players. Come on rallos zek, it s
|another world. You dont have only to take care of stupid mobs, but vicious
|players. This is a real challenge.

	There is no challenge at all.  A challenge is a fight that can go either
way.  There are no challenges in PvP muds, because only an idiot will engage
in a fight he is not 100% certain of winning.

	Not referring to using your own character to pull your own corpse, just
referring to the fact that there are lots of Rogue twinks out there these
days.

|Ok, next, lets give caster NPC fightin abilities to caster PC. A wizard
|punch you for 124 points of damages ... why not ? lets screw the gameplay !
|You are too greedy, you are not objective.

	No, you are simply overvaluing the bind rules.  Equallizing the bind rules
would not change game balance at all.  It would simply reduce tedium.

|Are you afraid ? You must have balls to play on a pvp server,

	No, actually the one thing you can't have on a PvP server is balls.
Victory will obtain to the cowards who attack from surprise and/or with
overwhelming numbers and firepower, not to those who behave with any sense of
honor or fair play.

|The monster on test server, will be prolly later a new class playable to add
|clever NPC in the environement.

	Nope -- will not be introduced to the blue servers.

|I love that idea, but not you it seems, you
|dont like the challenge, you want everything be easy, quick, painless,
|foreseeable.

	Yes, I don't like challenge.  That would be why I soloed a Ranger to level
49 before the EP penalty was lifted, to 51 before we were given Panic Animal
(which made soloing a Ranger a task fit for a trained lemur monkey), why I ran
around most of Luclin solo before the maps were out and why I was out soloing
in the Grey before they decided they didn't really want people hunting in that
zone after all.  I suppose that's also why I endured five months of signing up
for every Hate raid I could find to complete my epic.

|I never had this problem, you should ask more politely or maybe with more
|humility.

	Doesn't matter how you ask.  I gave up the roleplayed approach because it
doesn't get better results than /ooc PAYING for a bind at the bank!

|If you catch one, hail him, and ask him by tell, he will bind you, morever
|for a sow or a buff.

	That would be rude.  If people want to provide services they will either
advertise their availability or answer a general call.  Targetted requests are
an intrusion.

|You dont use use the good methode, or act like a jerk, because i never had
|to ask twice for a bind.

	If you are sending people /tells asking for binds, you ARE acting like a
jerk, and people are probably binding you so you will GO AWAY.

|After reading your thougt, you look someone hurried, you want instant fun
|(play ?)

	This is a form of entertainment, not a way of life.  It is not out of
order to expect to be able to play on my schedule, and making me sacrifice
half an hour of my leisure time every time I move my character to a new
continent just pisses me off.

|, easy kill, you want to be able to do everything you need, you

	No, I don't want to be able to do everything; I just want to not have to
sit on my ass waiting for a basic game function.

|dislike challenge, you dislike playing *against* other PC, you refuse tactic
|fights.

	Sorry, but other players are poor opponents over the internet; there are
too many who only care about winning and not whether or not the game was worth
playing in the first place.  And there are no tactics in PvP muds, because
picking easy fights is not a "tactic".
