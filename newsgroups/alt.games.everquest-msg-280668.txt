Which maps are you talking about?  PoK and all the newbie zone maps do use 
black lines.  Higher level zones do not have maps provided from Sony.  If a 
player is downloading maps from a 3rd party (like maps.eq-toolbox) then the 
issue is really with the maps others are making and not those made by Sony. 
The mapping system in game would suggest that each person make their own 
maps as they explore zones; in which case a person could use whatever colors 
he or she desired.
