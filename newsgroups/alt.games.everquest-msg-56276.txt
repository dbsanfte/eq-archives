Boy, ain't it so. My enchanter grouped at the sarnak fort a while back with a
druid who insisted on wading in, dotting and taking a swing at the nicely mezzed
mobs on every single pull. The tank played a chanter main and sent me a "make him
/assist, or I will" kind of tell, so I began explaining to the drood in tells what
it is that enchanters do and why it is important that he not hit the mezzed mobs.
His response? "I think it's boring when we only fight one mob at a time and
besides, no one has died yet." (Not entirely true, I had already bought it once
when those formerly mezzed and now unmezzable because they were dotted mobs
decided it would be fun to beat the hell out of the chanter.)  I just kept
thinking that it was no wonder people hate druids so much. =P He eventually got
the message when I went into "mez it, memblur it, and let the moron deal with it
by himself if he insists on breaking mez" mode.
