I've recently joined a guild and I'm wondering if there is a shortcut
for /guildsay. It seems to me to be a pain to have to preface everything
with /guildsay when I want only the guild to hear it. And there doesn't
seem to be a shortcut for turning various chat channels on and off in
full screen mode, nor does there seem to be a way to set a default chat
mode like there is in windowed mode.

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
