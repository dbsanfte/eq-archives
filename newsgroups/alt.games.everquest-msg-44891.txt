If you have to ask, you're not going there any time soon.

This is NOT an elitist slam, or even a flame.  The only Plane
you can zone into is Fear, from the Feeroot, and even then
if you're not level 46 at least the portal won't let you in (much
less dying to the spectres and such around there ;-)  ).

The other Planes are port-only, by wizards.  Again, level 46+
only can go, others will be left behind on the port.  Just ask
my level 9 Ogre shaman who got invited into a forming Hate
raid while exp'ing in S. Ro.   Nobody noticed my level, and
after folks found out _why_ I got left behind, they had a good
laugh.
