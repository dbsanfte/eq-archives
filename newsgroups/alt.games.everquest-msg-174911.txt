Hey all,

I am I fairly new player to EQ, with a few chars in the mid-30's, But I seem
to have a problem ...

I cant find anywhere fun to hunt =(

I have a

35 Cleric
31 Monk
32 SK
35 Bst
34 Chanter

My bst is the only one really capable of solo'ing to any real degree, and
I'm really enjoying playing him, wandering all over the world killing and
exploring, But i'm having a really hard time with my other toons, I would
love to get my Cleric leveled up, but I seem to be stuck hunting in the same
3 zones, Dawnshroud (on the tribals, which is poor exp for the chanter and
Cleric) Overthere (Boring) and  The Great Divide (Takes forever to find
anyone to group with).

I've asked people I know, and in zone but these are the only zones that ever
get suggested to me, I've hunted with guildys in Rathe mnts for a while that
was fun, but I couldnt be sure to get a group if I just popped in.

I have all the expansions, can anyone suggest somewhere I could take any of
these guys to hunt ?
Loot would be nice but its exp I'm really after ...

Thanks for any help you can offer =)
