    Not really my famous last words, but a friend of mine. We were in
Iceclad on the dragon bridge and at the time, I had autofollow on. He then
goes up to the edge of the dragon bridge, and seems to be looking over the
side. He then asks me to come over and look down. Right about that time, I
decide that autofollowing the guy was probably not the brightest choice so I
break autofollow and immediately, he disappears.
    I swear, 2 seconds later, I see an "Oh SHIT!". Which he later informs me
he had the time to type as he was plummeting to his death. :)
