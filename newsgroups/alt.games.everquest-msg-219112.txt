Would be wrong even.  It has a fixed haste percentage, applies only when 
wielded, so, only to itself.  You are correc tthat the stats displayed 
are the base stats, not modified by it's haste.  The Mith 2H was decent 
in that it got the huge damage bonus for high delay, but, with it's built 
in haste was not that high a delay.  It's a piece of crap now 
unfortunately what with mudflation.
