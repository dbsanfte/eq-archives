Sadly, this doesn't include Monual's exciting Bridge stories,
which seem to center around one of his characters playing a card
game with some other characters who's classes, races, and levels
aren't given.  In fact, I'm not certain that Monual is the
character playing bridge, if so, he's adopted an alias for the
purpose.
