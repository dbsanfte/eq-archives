>I always thought the high elves were more like Vulcans from Star Trek,

Thats exactly how I play Kadath.  Not 'logical' but stern, serious,
somewhat bigotted against the darker races and gnomes, and ready to
unleash his wrath when called upon.  Also fiercly loyal, sarcastic and
a punster and wisecracker when the times call for it.

Sam / Kadath
