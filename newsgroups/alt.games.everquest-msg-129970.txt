Not necessarily. I don't know the circumstances that cause it or if it
is by design, but I was killed twice in Kithicor at night. Once about
halfway through as high up on the wall as possible and once almost to
the corner near the WC zone, also as high on the wall as I could get.
Both times were with char's. in their upper teens and it was a caster
mob that nuked me into oblivion with like two strikes. May even be
worse now that NPC are more spell-smart.
