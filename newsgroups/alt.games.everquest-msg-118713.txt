at the time i was level 10 maybe 11. No looting rules were ever
stated.  My whole problem with this situation is the NBG people who
only camp things they need, and then try calling you greedy for
wanting a fair share of the loot.  when in my opinion they are they
greedy ones, expecting other to help them when they will not help you.
