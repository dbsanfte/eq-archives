Probably a troll, since this was discussed fairly extensively last week,
but in brief:
- It's against Sony's EULA. So legally it's dodgy if not outright illegal.
- as far as Sony is concerned the account still belongs to the original
  account owner and they can reposess it at any time. So you can lose the
  account very easily; and don't look for sympathy here.
- If Sony catches you doing it, because it's against the EULA they may
  cancel the account.
- As a game - and if treated as a game rather than work - levelling is
  half the fun. Buying a "pre-levelled" character sort of misses the point.
- For characters - you don't have any experience playing that class/level,
  but those around you can't see that. Your learning experiences may be
  costly to those around you. So it *can* hurt people. Perhaps not
physically,
  but it can cost them time and effort.
- Those who have come to know the original account owner through the
  characters you've bought will suddenly be confronted by somebody who they
  can (perhaps) no longer trust, who may take advantage of a trust
  relationship that means nothing to them.

It's the last two factors that make "character bought on ebay" an insult
to most players. It's the first few factors that indicate that spending
money on ebay for an account says unflattering things about your
intelligence. (And adds to the insult, of course.)
