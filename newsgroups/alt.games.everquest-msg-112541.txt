A computer that has not been invented yet.

I'm not understanding some of you people's NEED to play this game with
full clipping. FULL CLIPPING IS INCREDIBLY GOD DAMN FAR OUT THERE. 
I play with clipping two notches out and its more than far enough.
CREATURES OR PEOPLE are not seen according to clipping, only far off
trees and buildings are. You don't NEED to see a tree or building 75
miles away. Once you become familiar with the lay of the land you
could have clipping all the way down and do quite fine.

Turn the clipping down. I'm on a p2 400, 576 meg of ram, windows 98
and a geforce MX 400 64 meg and I play at 30 FPS often.. I am using
LOW textures, have texture compression and texture caching on, and I
have clipping about two notches up from the bottom. I see plenty far
and play great.

You are about at the zenith of what would remotely help now. Clipping
works hand and hand with the default Umbra of EQ to improve your frame
rate. Let me explain how:

this is you
%

This is you in a hall way with a bunch of crap far away at the end,
lets say the hallway is VERY long and you have clipping at max with
a bunch o' complex crap at the end of the hallway, so this is what you
are rendering getting 15 frames per second:

----------------------- DR&E(*&E*R&E(*ER
%                          FFF*(ER&E(*R&RERIEUREOI
----------------------- F&(*&##RERUEOIRUE

This is what I'm rendering with clipping 2 notches out:

---------
%
---------

By having clipping so far out, you are actually crippling any
advantage that your MUCH better hardware is giving you. Eventually I'm
going to be seeing all the cool stuff at the end of the hallway
anyway, its going to look just as good but my frame rate is going to
be way higher because I'm only displaying a small amount of it.
