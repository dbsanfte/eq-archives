There is probably something in the readme (or whaterver .TXT) file in
your EQ directory.

You can also go into options and look at the keyboard commands, That
is how I found the mapping tool (default is "Backspace"). You can also
download really good maps at http://maps.eq-toolbox.com (I think
that's the right link).

Info on the new zones is pretty much spread across the popular EQ
sites. Browse some of the more active class boards and you should find
decent info. As I understand it, you have to make armor dies (brewing,
pottery), and the components run about 35pp. I am sure
www.eqtraders.com has the info on pricing and trivials by now.

Once you get past level 2-3 it's not so bad. I think they made it more
3-5 friendly, and for a Wizard just starting out it is really brutal.
I highly recommend taking the PoK book to Qeynos or Freeport. The rats
in those locations occasionally drop tails that sell for @1.5pp each.

I have run my Froggy Wizard up to 25 untwinked. (rat tails, and then
wisps funding spells). I have spent most of the exp time in the
Shadeweavers side of Paludal. The exp per kill can't be beat, and as a
Wizard that kills fast and then sits for a while medding it is ideal.
