One of the major peces of opposition is that the warden MAY have spent a couple of
seconds looking for the cleric before bathing him in rage damage.  This is a problem
because something the player did stopped the MOB from attacking breifly.  Anyone who
has ever been summoned knows that skill does the EXACT same thing to the player.
Verant knows it and does nothing about it, why in my opinion, it gives the MOB a
slight advantage.  Yet that is the same thing Verant claims Conquest was able to do
with the Warden.  However, Conquest's counter claim is that the cleric would then take
masive amounts of rage damage, couldn't someone look in the logs to see if and when
the clerics were agro and if they did infact take rage damage?
