The only Troll that I would create would be an SK. The stats are not that
much different then the Oger and natural Regen is a big plus. Iksar have
much better stats but can not wear Plate Armor. A well dressed Troll SK can
do alot of damage and take alot of abuse. With Dots and your Pet (as weak as
he might be) can get and hold agro with the best of them. If you plan on
taking him to 60 and being a major Tank put a fair share of bonus points
into Sta.
