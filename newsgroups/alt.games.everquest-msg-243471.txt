If you were farming, I imagine you were encumbered...
encumberance increases falling damage exponentially.  when encumbered you
can and will take falling damage everytime you zone because when you zone
you are slightly above the ground.. most likely to prevent you from zoning
into the ground or falling under the world.. as you enter the new zone you
drop a foot or two and take damage.
increase the distance of the fall and you're pancake material.  I did the
same thing in my 20's as a wood elf ranger in loio. Some friends and I were
killing in one of the guard towers on the sarnak fort and my friend went out
the window as we were leaving..  looked like fun to me so out I went..
LOADING.... PLEASE WAIT.
as was mentioned once the damage reaches a certain point it's all 20k,
enough to kill anyone as you have fallen too far with too much weight on
you.
