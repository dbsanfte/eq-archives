Looks like a great system!

You didn't mention which OS you are going to run, though.

The graphics work fine on XP or Win2000, but the audio is utter
crap.  And it doesn't seem to matter which audio card you use.. it's
apparently some flaw either in Win2000/XP or Everquest that they don't
work well together.

So if you plan to use this as a Everquest-only machine,
I'd suggest using Win98SE (if you can find it somewhere).  Audio
is great there.   My wife runs Win98SE with nice speakers and such...
very very nice.  If you really need Win2000 or XP, I'd suggest turning
off the music and being satisfied with mediocre audio effects.

You could also consider a dual-boot environment, where you boot Win98SE
to run EQ, and then reboot Win2K to do work or other things.
