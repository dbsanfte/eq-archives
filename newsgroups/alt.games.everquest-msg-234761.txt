Hehe. I have a lvl 16 Bard in Fennin Ro. Once, I was fighting a bear, 
meleeing and at the same time singing the healing song to myself (I 
wasn't all too clued in on what Haste did at the time). This guy walked 
along, watched me for a bit, and said: "Nice twisting, dude", and left.

I think that must have been the last time I logged Parsifal, other than 
to strip his droppable equipment for cash.
