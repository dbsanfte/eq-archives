Definitely build up 2 Hand Slashing, because that is what you use to do your
most damage, it is also what the Paladin epic is, though if you are a
powergamer then there are much better weapons than that now.  Keep building
up 1 Hand Slashing and Bash, because you will want this for main tanking and
interrupting casters.  1 & 2 Hand Blunt are optional I believe but there are
good weapons out there for Paladins with these skills as well.

I also HIGHLY recommend training piercing.  Some Paladins dispute this (some
still don't realise we can now train this skill) but some of the best (and
best looking) weapons are piercing.  Your greatest problem with training
piercing is that there are few lower level piercing weapons that a Paladin
can use.  Messenger of the Queen is fairly cheap (150pp or less even on my
server - looks like a pitchfork though :-p).

As for training skills I would follow this pattern - once you level raise
your 1HS the maximum 5 points per level, then switch to 2HS or whatever you
are raising, and use it for the remainder of the level (you may want to
stick to good grouping to start with though because you may not being doing
significant damage to solo).  It might be slow and take a few levels but
best to start it now.  Also when grouping with a shaman make sure you get a
DEX buff.  Also be aware that the lower the delay on your weapon the quicker
it will raise your skill.

Once you get to level 40 your skills max at 200 until level 51, so that
gives you some time to catch up.  I have 1HS and 2HS both maxed at 200, but
am still raising my other skills - 1HB 185, 2HB 179, Piercing 189 (archery
is maxed at 75 too).
