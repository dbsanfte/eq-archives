When you have a well buffed tank who can hold the aggro of the critter
he's fighting and you either have single pulls, or good crowd control (mez,
roots, fear, tanking off, doesnt matter - as long as they're not loose).

CH will build you a hefty chunk of aggro, so you dont want anything wandering
around getting pissed at you. Make a hotkey to alert your group to something
on the cleric in case crowd control fails so they can keep you alive.

Good advice is to start healing at 2 bubbles or so, provided your tank
isnt being majorly swamped. If you're using CH make sure you've given your
tank whatever buffies (symbol and... bravery at that level?) will increase
his HP total, and get any shamans, etc, in the group to do the same - you'll
increase the HP healed for the same mana cost.

While learning the aggro generated wait a few seconds before sitting down to
med again after the CH, let the tank taunt a few times. Otherwise, you may
find CH, sit, whack.
