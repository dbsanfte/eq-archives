Try World of Warcraft,if your PC can run EQ1 it can run
WoW too,and you get a much better game,EQ1 is dieing rapidly,lost
about 1/2 of its players in the last half year.
Starting out as a newbie now means you are doomed to solo all your
way up to the 60s,and when you are there,you are still doomed because
in the meantime SOE has will have raised the level cap to 80.   :)
You come from Diablo and think soloing can be fun ? - Not in EQ1,all
the good stuff is only available to raiders or looong time players,and
dont dare to think about playing a melee class as a newbie,you will be
doomed more,melee classes are all about gear and you have to compete
with long-time-player-twinked chars for the ultra rare open spot in a 
below 70 group.  :)
