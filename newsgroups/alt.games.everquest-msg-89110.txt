Well, either get a group for geonids (don't even think about soloing one),
or group for HGs in Rathe, it may not be great but it's money.

Or better yet, just level normally, loot what you can get, and then make
money later.

Or my method, buy cheap shit in EC and sell it for exorbitant prices.  (I
love it when idiots sell coldain skin stuff for 1500)  the hot sellers that
I've found recently are: (with prices on Tarew Marr)

Cobalt, any piece, especially bracer and boots for the non-rare pieces (IE
the BP and legs) (approx 3-5k per piece on gloves/arms/boots, 5-8k on bracer
and helm, 60-80k on BP, and the legs are NOT sold due to the invis effect,
thus essentially priceless or pay your first, and second born for one if
somebody is selling)
Coldain skin gloves/boots (3k each)
Eboots (slightly tapering off though in demand in the last week or 2) (can
get 3k but usually offers are about 2500)
Fungi tunics (were up to 27k after luclin "nerf", now back down around 22k)
Jade reavers (epic ripoff bastards) (every time I've seen one for sale it's
been around 30k or more)
Jaundiced bone bracer (JBB)(if you have one, ask as much as you can) (I've
seen them as low as 12k, and up to 30k)
Elder Spiritist Arms (ES arms)(paid 2k for mine, I don't trade these, too
rare to buy regularly and I plan to use mine as soon as I make 45)
Centi swords (long or short) also tend to be easy to sell, although they've
fallen a LOT in price lately

At any rate, my equipment is listed at
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39316
I have no higher level characters, I don't do long camps for rare items, and
the only things that I've been given were the veil and nathsar bracer (the
same person that gave me those items gave an RL friend of mine a sash of the
dragonborn), and I looted the Elder wolf hide and totem of warrior spirit
personally, everything else droppable I've bought in EC. (Granted though, it
does help to have friends who loan you money for quick upgrade buy new
stuff/sell old stuff)
