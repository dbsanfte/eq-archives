From memory, I went straight to plate but http://www.eqtraders.com/ can tell
you for sure. It's not easy past that point. Eventually you hit acrylia or
shadowscreem and I've foudn both awful. Tailoring is easier, and it's
nasty... on the other hand, I've seen level 65's solo every
rockhopper/Tribal in DSP so I'm sure they would find gathering ingredients a
doddle.

Unfortunately, EQ's idea of an artisan is a very high level casting type,
although smith can use str stats instead, so warriors et al can do it as
well.
