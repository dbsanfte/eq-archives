So make a smart-assed remark that only pretends to be on topic.
The discussion was about paying for KEI from an_enchanter_in_nexus01.
If I'm part of a group with an Enchanter in it, I'm <not> in the Nexus,
I'm killing mobs somewhere else.  If I'm in a group with a porter
that's passing thru the Nexus in hopes of picking up KEI and an
Enchanter would rather join us than continue playing KEI whore I'm
sure as hell not gonna be the one to say no.

P.S.  The log parser is great.  :)
