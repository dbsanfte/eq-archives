For me it goes even further... I can't see myself playing anything other 
than Humans, even my INT caster alts. I guess that, except for the red 
hair and green eyes*, which are a bit of a wish-fulfillment trip, 
Hanrahan is, to all effects and purposes, me. 

*and the fact that I can't cast spells in real life either.
