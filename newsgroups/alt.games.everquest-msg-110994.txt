No worse than debates on rec.arts.anime.misc, where I'm also the resident
right winger.  I don't think I ever convince anyone that I'm right, but I
hope I've gotten a few more people to see that we conservatives do have a
valid viewpoint, and we're not just ye-ol'-hatemongers.  I seek not
conversion, simply understanding.

As far as you "fringers" go, I don't mind discussing these things with
y'all, just not from such a defensive position.  Some of the best religious
discussions I've had were with pagans (something I'd really like to learn
more about), and a buddhist (it was fun looking at the compatablity between
christianity and buddhism).  It works better on a one-on-one basis, though,
that way both parties are on equal footing.

Not a problem.  It's good to have a little light conversation every once in
a while ^__^
