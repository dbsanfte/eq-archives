Nice try.

Effort:  7/10
Validity: 0/10

Your analogy fails because no one in the theater would 
have any way of knowing whether the threat was real or not.

Loki knew the guy wasn't a GM, and therefore knew there 
was NO threat to his account.

To use the theater as an example. An employee picks up the 
phone and hears, " This is Bob Jones the manager, you're
fired ", when it just happens that the real Bob Jones is standing 
next to him.  You think the employee felt his job was threatened ?
