Cresent Moon Pants
AC 250
Modifer: Dodge 50%
all stats +100
HP + 300 Mana + 300
All saves +100
Don't remember if it had a right click effect.
All/All

Cold Iron Bracers (normally drops in the Warrens)
AC 250
Modifier Dodge 75%
all stats +100
HP + 300 Mana + 300
All saves +100
Right click Memory Erase (Casting Time: Instant)
All/All

Got a screen shot of the latter.

They repopped all zones on all servers about 3pm EST to reset them to fix
these items, which were indeed fixed afterwards. I am guessing these are the
programmed max stats for items.
