486SX-20 is closer to what Verant will admit.

Actually... when pushed about their hardware setup, Verant will only admit
something along the lines of "we have a bunch of customised Amiga 1000s
networked together".

Now, for those not familiar with Amiga... bear in mind the top end PC at the
time was 486SX-20 and SX-25
Motorola 68000 processor running at about 16Mhz (yes... that IS the same
processor you mom now has in her washer/dryer!)
512k ram... expandable to 8meg and beyond (I seem to remember 64meg was the
upper limit on the A1000, icbw)
Forget the name of the OS (Workbench?), but it was a real beauty to work
with... could multi-task and was quite advanced for its time...

BUT... Amigas were quite happy to accept all kinds of acceleration hardware
(Plug'n'Play about 6 years before Microsoft even coined the phrase!), were
real easy to network, and the OS was practically indestructible for normal
use... and pretty easy to debug when you broke it ;o)

As an example... the special effects for Babylon 5 and Seaquest DSV were
both done with Amiga 1000s hooked up to something called 'The Video Toaster'
(a wonderful piece of kit you could mail-order for yourself) at a fraction
of the price that StarTrek:TNG was spending at the time on it's SFX.

Alas... that was back in the days of tight-coding and pushing the available
hardware... these days companies just wait for Intel to ship a new Pentium
upgrade and tell you to buy extra memory :o(
