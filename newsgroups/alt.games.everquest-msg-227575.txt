Problem is, Caster's Realm is the only site where it pops up.  Nowhere else.

Followed the identification doc here; nothing in my system related to
NetPal.

Installed, ran, it identified a bunch of things (mostly cookies), none of
them being NetPal.

If I *do* end up with NetPal on my system, I just hope that AdAware does a
better job of removing it than it did with Globe Finder (which it was never
able to totally remove).
