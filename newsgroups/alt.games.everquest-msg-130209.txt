I can say from personal experience that a
naked Dwarf can run (with AA2 but not SoW)
from the Mons zoneline, through the Grey,
and into the Temple for a breath of air,
*just* before he starts "drowning".

I had no idea if I could, so I gave it a shot.

Good thing my body was near the Temple...
I then zoned back out, trotted over to it,
and looted my Fishbone Earring first.
