    Heh, quite the set of conditions. Personally, I'm a fan of having one
set of gear, period. But let's see what we can do for you.

    AC is low. HPs are low. We may have to shed WIS for AC/HPs, in addition
to upgrading resists.

    Ok, let's get to work!

> --GEAR--
> Face: Velium Ruby Veil: STR +8, WIS +8, Wt. 0.1

    Consider the possibility of buying an Enshrouded Veil: AC 7 HP/MANA 30
WIS/INT 2 Sv. Fire 10 weight 0.1. Should be fairly cheap, as a lot of the
melees that were driving up the price have switched to the mask off Crystal
Eyes. It drops in Howling Stones, which you could do in a single group at
your level but which isn't a pickup zone. There's also a mask that's a
random rare drop off beetles in Sebilis, the Bone Mask of the Jarsath: AC 7
STR 2 WIS 4 CHA 8 Sv. Poison/Disease 5 and weight three. There's also a
disease resist mask with 55 MANA that drops as a random rare drop off
mushrooms in Fungus Grove, but the name of it escapes me at this time.

> Head: Runed Circlet: AC +4, WIS +4, INT +4, Wt. 1.0

    Kylong War Helm is AC 12 Sv. Magic 7 Sv. Poison 4 HP/MANA 20, drops in
Howling Stones, sells cheaply. Could also buy a Nightshade Wreath (AC 1
INT/WIS 5) to cover lost WIS from other slots, drops in Mistmoore. Lots of
greens there, not terribly farmable by you.

> Fingers: Platinum Jasper Rings (2): WIS +6, Wt. 0.1

    In Fungus Grove in Luclin, the Bandits there drop the Shadel Bandit Ring
fairly often: AC 6 HP/MANA 55 Sv. Disease 10 Sv. Cold 5. It's Lore, so
you'll only get the one, but it's quite simply a superlative item. If you
have to have WIS rings, upgrade one of them to a Velium Jasper ring for the
extra one WIS - the upgrade cost should be minor. Fungus Grove is a pickup
zone.

> Chest: Bloodstained Tunic: AC +13, AGI +4, WIS +4, Wt. 6.5

    Sebilite Scale Tunic drops in Disco Two camp in Sebilis: Wt 5.60. +22
AC, +6 Str, +6 Wis, +6 Cha, +2 vsMg, +2 vsCold, +2 vsDis. The Froglok Scale
Chestplate is a random rare drop off golems in Sebilis: Wt 5.50. +24 AC, +5
Wis, +5 Int, +3 Cha. Given how little WIS you have in this slot, you might
even consider Ry'Gorr Battle Mail, from the Chief in Eastern Wastes: Wt
1.00. +18 AC, +10 Str, +5 vsPos, +20 Mana. Would really fix your weight
problem fast, at a cost of 24 MANA total.

> Back: Mammoth Hide Cloak: AC +7, WIS +4, Save vs. Cold +5, Wt. 2.5

    You mentioned the Aegis of Life: Wt 9.50. +12 AC, +10 Wis, +25 vsDis.
This has a lot of WIS and Sv. Disease, but it's heavy and possibly the most
drawn-out, boring camp in EQ. Be aware of that. Alternatives in the back
slot are Cloak of the Ry'Gorr Oracles (Wt 2.00. +6 AC, +2 Wis, +2 Int, +5
vsMg, +10 vsCold, +10 Mana, should be cheap to purchase), the Shissar Scale
Cloak from The Grey (Wt 2.50. +6 AC, +5 Wis, +5 Int, +25 Mana, need some
form of permanent Water Breathing to stay in the zone), the Kunzar Cloak
from Karnor's (Wt 0.10. +7 AC, +2 Wis, +2 Int, +10 vsFire - very cheap,
especially if you go to Karnor's to /auc for it), and the Heirophant's Cloak
from the Crypt in Sebilis (Wt 1.00. +10 AC, +4 Str, +4 Sta, +4 Agi, +4 Dex,
+4 Wis, +4 Int, +4 Cha, +75 HP, +75 Mana). My advice would be to purchase a
Ry'Gorr cloak, then try to get into a Crypt group in Sebilis (lots of cash
goodies drop there, you'll love it.)

> Legs: Gatorscale Leggings: AC +7, WIS +4, HP +15, Wt. 0.4

    Guardian Leggings (Wt 4.00. +12 AC, +4 Str, +4 Wis, +5 Cha, +5 vsMg, +15
vsFire, +15 vsCold, +15 HP) are no drop items off guards in Skyshrine, if
you're willing to hurt that faction. You could also get Sentry Leggings (Wt
3.50. +13 AC, +3 Agi, +3 Dex, +5 Cha, +5 vsMg, +10 vsPos, +10 vsDis, +30
Mana) off Sentry Enots in the same area. Many people do the Kromrif Military
Leggings quest (Wt 4.00. +14 AC, +6 Str, +5 Wis, +5 vsCold, +5 vsDis) with
few people and few problems, although the quest is a bit buggy. So lots of
possible Velious upgrades here.

> Feet: Acolyte's Anklet: AC +3, CHA +3, WIS +2, AGI +2, Wt. 1.2

    Aim for Golden Efreeti Boots: AC 5 INT/WIS 9, drop in Sol B. The efreeti
camp is very good XP at your level and one-group doable with ease, although
not pickup groups. The Boots are also the common drop, so you should come
out with some.

> Ranged: Ball of Velium: +1 to all resists, effect: Velium Shards, Wt. 0.0

    Are you a friend of the Coldain? If so, do I have a quest for you! The
Coldain Prayer Shawl quests require some pretty high level tradeskill scores
as you go further along with them. However, the first two only need frost
giant toes and heads, and the third requires a tracker to help you in
Eastern Wastes and a good Baking skill. Baking is easy to raise to the level
required by this quest, and could be used by you in other ways (such as
making weight zero point one, STR 2 INT -1 steaks that last longer than
summoned food to help you with weight issues). When you complete the third
shawl, you also happen to get a ranged slot item, Seal of Thoridain: AC 3
INT/WIS 3 MANA 30 Sv. Cold/Magic 3 No Drop. VERY nice for the effort
involved, which isn't a whole lot.

    There's also an item that drops from the Chieftain in Grimling Forest,
the Ceremonial Smudging Stick: Ac 3 WIS 3 MANA 30 Sv. Fire/Magic/Poison 10.
Not sure how farmable the area is by a cleric, though, and the Stick is the
rare drop.

> Inventory:

    Good inventory management can help with weight issues a lot more than
people first think. First question: do you really need as many inventory
slots as you have access to with the packs you have? If you can't carry much
weight, that's something to think about. Then, consider hand made backpacks.
They weigh the same as a regular backpack, have ten slots, and 10% WR -
usually sold for 100 pp each by tailors in EC. Even without changing the
number of slots you have open, we can replace five regular packs with four
Tailored ones and save another three pounds. Another question: do you do
your buying and selling in towns, or with vendors in isolated zones? If it's
in towns, then leave the Doll in the bank - you'll always have access to it
when you need the CHA.

    Hunting in Western Wastes (specifically, killing the dragons) will
destroy your Claws of Veeshan faction, so if you wanted to be with that
group then yes, don't do it. If you wanted to be Kael-aligned, don't worry
about it.
