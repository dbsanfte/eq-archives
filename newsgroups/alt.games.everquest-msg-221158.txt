OMG!  I wouldn't think that is a sign of things to come.  I have to tell you
that I am estatic when I actually get an even split with my cleric.  I
haven't had such great experiences with LDoN groups.  I had one ML
conveniently go LD just prior to the end of the adventure and never get
back.  I never seem to recoup the cost of the periodots I expend and rely on
my tradeskills and trader to make plat.  But, even so, it doesn't seem fair
at all to demand a greater than even share of the loot.
