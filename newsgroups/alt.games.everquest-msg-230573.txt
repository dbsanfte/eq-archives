awww. poor baby.  do what the majority of us did: learn to play without it.
Or find an enchanter and get good, old fashioned Clarity (C1) to make it
better.

if you're going oom that fast and that often, bitch at the pullers/crowd
controllers/slowers or look at the spells you're using.  are you throwing
your best heal the moment the tank takes some damage?  dropping a HoT (heal
over time) spell instead then continuing to med?

if sitting on your rear is not appealing to you, pick a melee
class....warrior or rogue or monk - maybe bard.  because it only gets worse
for casters.

I am GLAD that they "nerfed" c3.  why?  becasue it was a crutch for people
like you who want everything handed to them.  a cleric takes skill and some
work to play well.
