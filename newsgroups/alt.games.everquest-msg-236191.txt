I haven't used the test server much, so I don't know how its
downtime compares to that of the regular servers (and in
particular, regular servers soon after an expansion rolls out).
But I can certainly sympathise with the EQ programmers running
into problems in production that didn't show up in QA or test.
With lots more people pounding on the production servers, the
players are bound to try more combinations and run into things
that didn't happen to get covered on the test server, plus the
sheer volume might cause unforeseen problems.  (E.g., just to
make something up, suppose the new tribute buffs refreshing
every ten minutes wasn't expected to be a big deal, but in a
production-server PoK there are so many players running so many
buffs all at once that something overloads, or a rare race
condition comes up, and the zone crashes.  Should they say, oh
that's okay, let PoK crash randomly every 30 minutes or so,
possibly corrupting everyone's data in the process; we'll fix
it in a few days at the next scheduled downtime?

And yes, it's frustrating that it seems to happen every time an
expansion comes out.  The first time an expansion came out after
I'd started playing EQ, I was playing the next night and paid a
mage to summon me some no-rent WR bags.  Sometime after midnight
the server crashed and I couldn't get back on, so I lost a bunch
of loot.  (Fortunately I was paranoid enough not to keep any
hard-to-replace gear in those bags!)  I was annoyed, but it's
not as though I think I'm owed a refund, or that I should petition
to get the loot replaced.  Shit happens, especially after a major
update.
