I am 100% certain that it is correct.  I will occasionally rebuff
with Skin a little early if I'm low HP just for the HP gain (I
hardly ever heal myself when solo, if I'm wounded that just means
no melee skill practice for the next mob or three, depending).

As I just said, I do this routinely.  Oh and it depends in part
on the buff you use, the L1 Skin Like Wood either doesn't raise
your total as much as it raises your max (like the Shaman Inner
Fire) or doesn't raise it at all, can't recall.  As far as looking 
"injured" goes, my Paladin looks "injured" right after he casts,
because HP bar updates are always delayed nowadays it seems, wait
for the next tick (or whatever the delay is) and it gets adjusted.
Slightly OT:  That routine delay in total HP updates has made it a
lot harder for my Paladin to use LH as an emergency heal, if I don't
notice the message about somebody taking a big nuke the next nuke
may well land before I see any movement of their HP bar, it sucks.

Go ahead and try it.  I've been playing my Druid a lot more recently,
and Skin Like Rock and Skin Like Steel have the healing effect.
