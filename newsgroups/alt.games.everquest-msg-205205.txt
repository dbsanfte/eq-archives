I've heard that it takes 5 runs (including the gem turn-in) to max the
faction, but I've been holding off on doing this method so I can't confirm
it. I did do the Dire Wolf part twice as I'd forgotten to hand the gem from
the previous part in before I handed the pelt in (doh!) and he ate it.
Didn't get any faction for that though!
