A new zone was put in with the patch , along with storyline text explaining
what is going on in zone.Some people seem to be confused thinking this is the
new Ldon raid ,it is not it is a regular zone,even though there are wayfarer
characters there as part of storyline.Haven't gotten to check for new quests
yet.
