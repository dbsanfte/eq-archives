Please delete EQ from your hard drive and find an easier game.  Would sir be
interested in tic-tac-toe?

Ok, more constructive:

Rangers tank just as good at SKs/warriors/pallies until 50th.  At this point
the gear and defensive skills start to pull well ahead for "real" tank
classes and the discrepancy becomes much more noticable.  Pre-Kunark (ie.
pre-51+) rangers were favoured tanks for everything ... and that's not
changed, only the post 50 game changed that.

Visit www.interealms.com click rangers glade forums.  Love it, treasure it.
This will be your source of wisdom.

Leveling from 30-ish to 50+ is exceedingly fast for a ranger.  Choose a zone
with high numbers of animal mobs, mem snare, mem fear animal and go to town.
You'll fly through.  Recommended are: Iceclad (cougars), EW (many animals),
DSP rockhoppers.

At higher levels rangers turn into the DPS/buff utility role.  You'll be
workin the back of mobs and keeping your group buffed with high attack bonus
spells.  Rangers have superb aggro control, they can move up and down the
hate list at will far easier than pretty much any other class; if you're
quick on your feet you'll be the person keeping healers and pure casters
standing.

You think rangering's bad at 35?  Try being a warrior.  :-(
