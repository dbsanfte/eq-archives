When SOV first was released you had to pick up a dragon tooth in each of the
teleporters before you could teleport there, they got rid of this (though I
did not know that when I came back from a 1 year hiatus).
Seems people must have hated this, and whined about it. Now you want to put
it back in? (I would vote for putting it back in no problem) I am sure
people would whine as usual about this problem.
No matter what they do some bonehead will complain. It's in the game they
aren't going to make it harder move on.......
