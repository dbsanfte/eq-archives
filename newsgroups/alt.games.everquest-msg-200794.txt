Well, it's a moot point now...evoc is 53 and the abj is on the way up.  I 
went ahead and put the points in the others and then cast on myself in 
PoK till it went to 51.  Not a problem, just time consuming.

I did, however, notice that my divination skill is at a lowly 15!  In 
between pulls, and while waiting for a groupie to get rezzed, I started 
throwing out a few Div spells, and found out it was painfully low.  Ever 
try to cast invis when div  is at 12?  about 15 fizzles before it went 
off.  Guess my next step is to get all my spell skills maxed. (On a good 
note, Conjure and evoc ar maxed :)
