Yep. That's what Saturday mornings are for in our guild's case. We
mostly log on, check to see if there's already some epic action going,
then form up into xp grind or single party loot/item camps. But it's
understood that if the opportunity arises for somebody on a rare pop
spawn, you break camp as soon as you can safely do so and move on out to
the meeting area. Two weeks ago that happened for one of our chanters
with the big grape ape in Field of Bone. He kept a mule there watching
for it all the time, and it finally popped that Sat. morning. In about
twenty minutes we had a two group raid force there, buffed up, swam out,
and ganked it. Another epic notch ticked off. But again, if that dozen
of us hadn't had /gu chat turned on, we wouldn't have known, and it
wouldn't have happened.

Also good advice, which we mostly do. (We have a lot of druids in our
guild so that's not hard. And the all prefer to group rather than solo,
so we're very lucky that way.) But again, without /gu chat on, nobody
knows that a response is even *needed* so it would be a waste of time to
try.
