I don't think that is true.  AA's take a certain set number of exp
points.  If it takes 100,000 experience points for one AA, it will
take that same value at level 51 as it does at 65.  The end result is
that if you kill a higher level mob, you get more experience for it in
raw number value.  This is a greater percentage of one AA.  While a
level 62 gets more of his exp bar filled for the same mob than a 65,
in regular experience, the two will get identicle experience for the
same mob in AA.

In fact, one advantage of the 65 over the 62 is that in group
situations, assuming the two are both getting the same group and
killing exactly the same mob, the 65 is getting more exp in AA because
the game distributes more exp out to higher level people.  In a group
yesterday, I managed to pull in one AA every 75 minutes, chain pulling
in BoT.  I'm sure others can do faster, soloing in HoH or something,
but for me this was the best AA exp I could hope for.

As for when I would get AA's, your point was right on, Sean.
