They're the same as (or close to) Ak'Anon guard faction.  In other words, if
you're evil, you're dead unless you're a gnome.

By far the easiest way to get better faction is to hunt in SolB.  The really
nice thing is that you don't have to kill a thing...hit the kobolds once
while the "owner" of that dog is working on killing it.  If you're a healer,
heal the player.  Enchanter, tashan; shaman, slow...doesn't matter and can
be damned fast if you don't go into the zone with the idea in your head that
you actually have to take spawns away from people who are hunting there for
xp.
