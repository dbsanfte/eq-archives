Of course, or more generally cost of recovery from damage taken.
It's no accident that highend tanks are reporting buffed ACs well
in excess of 2500.  It's not uncommon to see advice along the lines
of "with only #### AC you'll need a second healer to tank there".

Actually, in-game experience is sufficient.  If you're dying to damage
spikes you need more HP.  If you're a mana sponge (i.e. you're running
your healer OOM) you need more AC.  I think part of the reason HP are
often trumpeted as most crucial, besides the well known CH-chain
tactic, is that the former problem really demands rapid correction,
while the latter is less urgent and so gradual improvement is
acceptable to all.
