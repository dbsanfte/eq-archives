This is NOT a blanket 'RoadRunner' Policy.  I have RoadRunner in Maine from
TimeWarner Cable and all accounts are allowed 5 computers connected for
free - all you need is a hub (not a router, switch or firewall, although you
could use one if you desire).  Check with your local ISP FIRST before
assuming their policy. ;)  This policy is generally established so they
don't have to maintain more than one IP transfer log for each account, which
costs extra storage and monitoring space on the ISP's end - in large
population districts this is generally the case, but it's always good to
check first.

You can get firewall switches/hubs for as low as $80 mail-order.  Not sure
what the local Circuit Shitty will charge you, however.
