My druid has been burned several times when porting without being paid
first, so now I always ask for payment first.  Several people have become
indignant and said things like "Well, I was going to pay you 50p, but since
you don't trust me I'll just pay you the 20p I said I would" or refused the
port entirely.

Grow up.  Why should I trust you if you won't trust me?  If you want a port,
pay for it.
