All I got to say is WTF is the difference between 8.0 and 8.1
anyway that would cause win95 to not work? Most software
programs list Win 9X (meaning 95 and 98 right?) as compatible
software. Since they are both so simular why did Microsoft make
8.1 unable (supposely, I haven't tested it but read it on their
website) to install? IMO its just Micro$oft latest cash grab to
upgrade to the latest PoS OS. Its a pity that a large amount of
people don't write M$ demanding backward combatibilty with
95. 

Now excuse me while I go beat this horse corpse.
