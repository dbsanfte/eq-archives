There is a way to deal with the combat (and other dedicated) music, although
it's a bit cumbersome to set up the first time.

1) Step One. First, take the two mp3's that you *want* to be your combat
music (there are two that alternate), and copy them to your EQ directory and
name them new1.mp3 and new2.mp3.

2) Step Two. Make copies of the files in your EQ directory named
combattheme1.mp3 and combattheme2.mp3 in the same directory and name these
copies old1.mp3 and old2.mp3. Then, in the same directory, create 2 batch
files (if you don't know how to create a batch file, see instructions
below), one that copies the two files new1.mp3 and new2.mp3 to
combattheme1.mp3 and combattheme2.mp3, and one that copies the two files
old1.mp3 and old2.mp3 to combattheme1.mp3 and combattheme2.mp3.

3) Step Three. Finally, make shortcuts to the batch files and put them on
your desktop. Name one OldEQ.bat (the one that copies oldX->combatthemeX)
and name the other NewEQ.bat (the one that copies newX.mp3 to
combatthemeX.mp3). Launch EQ and in the EQ patch dialog, uncheck the
Autoplay feature. Then quit back to the desktop.

Now, each time you want to play EQ, start by running the OldEQ batch file,
then launch EQ in the normal fashion. Once it's completed the filescan and
puts up the message "Filescan Complete", run the NewEQ batch file and then
hit the Play button and you're off to the races. Your two mp3 files will be
played whenever you are in combat. I do this with music from the LOTR
soundtrack files and it's a very nice alternative atmosphere that heightens
my sense of atmosphere.

// HOW TO MAKE THE BATCH FILES:

To create the batch files, go to your desktop and right click, choose the
New Text file option and type in the following, exactly like this):

@Echo Off
xcopy /Q /R /Y old1.mp3 combattheme1.mp3
xcopy /Q /R /Y old2.mp3 combattheme2.mp3

Save the above three lines and name this file OldEQ.bat (make sure and save
it with the .bat extension instead of the default .txt extension). The 2nd
batch file should be created with the following lines:

@Echo Off
xcopy /Q /R /Y new1.mp3 combattheme1.mp3
xcopy /Q /R /Y new2.mp3 combattheme2.mp3

Save the above three lines and name this file NewEQ.bat (make sure and save
it with the .bat extension instead of the default .txt extension).

From your desktop right click on each shortcut and choose Properties, then
choose to run the file in a minimized window (this ensures that you don't
see the batch file execute, making the process more transparent).

// END OF HOW TO MAKE THE BATCH FILES

If you want points for style, you could also add to the batch files commands
to replace the music for eqtheme (the startup music when you first launch
EQ) and the music for the various Planes. My batch files substitute the PoK
music file (poknowledge.mp3) this way.

Bit of a hassle to set up at first, but now I hear glorious music of my
choice whenever I play EQ, I like it. The suggestion made in this thread to
simply use the MP3 players certainly works and is much easier to implement,
but this will not preserve the distinction of battle music, it will simply
replace ALL music at ALL times with the MP3 being played. You won't have the
combat or town transitions, that's a price I didn't want to play.

It won't work to simply copy the files the first time, EQ always overwrites
them when it launches. I have tried resetting the file stamps on the files
and that didn't work, the game apparently checks the filesize and timestamp
to verify that the files are as expected. If anyone knows a cleaner way to
do this than I've discovered, I'd love to hear about it.
