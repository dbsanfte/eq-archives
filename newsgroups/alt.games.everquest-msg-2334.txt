The retention rate for shamans in general is very low. Compound that with
people wanting to be "safe" and picking an old world race to level up in
(despite the VAST superiority of kunark), and you don't get many ikky
shamans.

Ironic, considering that iksars are, hands down, the best shaman race. By a
lot. Even their armor woes have been shattered by Velious and the new
scaled heirophant armor dropping in Hate.
