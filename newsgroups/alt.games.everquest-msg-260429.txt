Aaaah.... the good old days....

Though I did it with Caimens in Oasis. I'd usually buff up anyone who
had the misfortune to run into one of my crocs after they run away
from it... except druids. Too many damn kiting druids back in those
days, I just let them die. Since my crocs had L60 sow on them, the
druid's defense skill often got a workout....
