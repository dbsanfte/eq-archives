I think that being willfully ignorant in a situation like that qualifies as
stupid.  That's my personal opinion.  When I encounter a problem with a
product I have purchased, the first thing I do is take a look at the manual,
and see if it can help me with the problem in some way.  If a person chooses
to purposely not know anything at all about a product they are trying to
use, then they are being stupid.

I think that it is safe to say that you have a completely different
definition of stupid than many of us here.
