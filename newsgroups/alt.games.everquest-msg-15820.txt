Got into a pickup group in Sebilis once.  2 rogues, cleric, druid, shaman,
and me (enchanter).

Started heading in.  But then we stopped and headed back out.

You see, we had no taunter.  I have no doubt that the rogues could have
slaughtered any of the mobs we would have come up against.  But they would
not have been able to pull them off either me or the cleric before we died.

Fortunately, we realized this while fighting our way in.
