    He killed dwarves and brownie guards in GFay, and used his own
characters to PL himself to 60. The reason he took as long as he did was
because he didn't have others play the character in shifts. As for the shock
factor, understand that the race to level X is close-ended. The first person
is, well, the first person. The leaderboard for LDoN is open-ended - there's
no final goal that everyone can agree on. Without a final goal, you can't
really declare yourself a "winner", so why race?

    Actually, Furor's rogue (first Live character to 50) wasn't played in
shifts either. He knew all the best places to PL, and had set up a group
with a cleric and a few rogues precisely because of how they could take
advantage of those spots. In particular, one place (a small set of Dar frog
spawns in Upper Guk) was removed from the game because of how they used the
spawn to hit 50 so fast.

    A number of server-first-to-50 (and later 60 and 65, for newer servers)
people have been played in shifts. But the big ones - first overall to 50,
to 60, and to 65 - weren't.

    James
