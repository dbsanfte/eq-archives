Hi Mike,  I will offer a few bits of information to be used or thrown out,
your choice :)

As a pali  you may be the main tank on occasion.  If you have not done so
already, setup an 'incoming! %t' button as someone here suggested.

Talk in advance with your group before you start pulling.  Make sure people
use /assist on you, take out mobs in this order:
1 - healers (use stun spell when you see them starting to heal)
2 - casters
3 - melee

At your level you will not likely have an enchanter who can mezmorize an
additional (/add) mob.  If you do get 2 beasts on you, tell the casters in
advance to root one of them when they are running back.   This gives your
party time to smash one to bits and hopefully have it killed before the root
breaks and the 2nd beast is on you.

As a cleric, I *hate* it when people bolt as their hitpoints drop.. that
being said, however, I don't usually let their hps get down low enough to
enstill fear in them... if that happens, I screwed up.  For this reason it's
important for clerics or the main healer of your group to give regular
updates on their mana status.  Last but not least, if all else fails and
your group is going to be paying the piper, run to safety.

ie.
Casters are either LOM or OOM
2 mobs are bashing up your main tank(s) very fast

If the tanks are getting low on health and you ARE SURE that death awaits,
give the order to flee.  I will usually try to fire off a root or two before
splitting just to slow down the mobs, a snare or something would also work
great.

All this being said, the best experience is failure :)   You will quickly
learn and adapt your on strategies, good luck
