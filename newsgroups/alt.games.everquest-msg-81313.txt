    I don't know that 55 is the level where it should start (I'd lean more
towards 51), but frankly it's about time. The Fungi Tunic is quite possibly
the single most broken item in the game. The fact that it can replace an
entire person when PLing up someone tells me that. I'd love one for my 40
monk and my 25 shaman, but if they won't work for them any more I won't lose
sleep over it.
