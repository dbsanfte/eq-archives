Kill things.

Take their stuff.

Make friends.

Go with them to kill things and take their stuff.

It is, frankly, a great deal more fun than that summary makes it sound
-- my wife is now hooked, and I'm along for the ride. 

If you mean "I don't know what to kill, or what to do with the stuff I
take", try starting by talking to your guildmaster, who will
undoubtedly have a desperate need for rockhopper spleens or rat
kidneys or goblin toenails, and will give you more guidance when you
provide him with these. The economy of Norrath, at least at low
levels, is based almost entirely on body parts; you give body parts to
NPCs, and they give you weapons, armor, and jewelery.

I also recommend www.allakhazam.com, which provides detailed
instructions on just who wants which body parts, and what you will get
for them.
