A decent puller can have mobs arriving in pairs as the last one in the 
camp drops.

Sure there is a minor drop in dps as he has to make extra trips... but 
that's compensated by not having your enchanter and healer burn all that 
extra mana... 

And of course, you wipe less, which is the biggest time sink in the 
game.
