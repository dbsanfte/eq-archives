UO was pretty good, but all the MMORPG'S since then made their cities 
intentionally confusing and in a manner no sentient beings would 
ever design or live in. My theory is it's an attempt to create the illusion
of content and compelexity. The designers don't appear to grasp the notion 
that difficulty in finding where you want to go in a speedy manner becomes
a pain in the ass--not a welcomed challenge.
