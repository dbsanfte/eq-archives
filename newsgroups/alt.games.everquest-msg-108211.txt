Here's an odd one...

Whenever I try to track a friend of mine, sometimes they show up on radar,
sometimes they don't.  And no, it's not because they are out of range, as I
can track the person that they are with, but not them.

I have /trackplayers ON, but this is weird.  Sometimes I'll hit track when I
can see them, but they may or may not show up.

Anyone else have this happen?
