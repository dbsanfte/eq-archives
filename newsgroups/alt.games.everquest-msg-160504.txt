I successfully installed it at the second attempt and have chatted to a
Guild Mate :)

DO NOT change the default installation path, it will not work. If you do so,
you will have to go through the registry by hand and delete all keys that
refer to EQIM - risky at best!

DO NOT try to join channels, EQIM crashes.

DO NOT waste a lot of time adding Buddies to your list, they do not get
saved when you quit. Though there seem to be placeholders for them in the
.xml files created.

Frequent disconnects while idle, though it was fine when I was chatting.
