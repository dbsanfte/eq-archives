It doesn't matter whether you own Microsoft or a lemonade stand
outside your mom's house. The mere fact that you would consider
contacting the CEO of a multinational corporation over something as
trivial as a change in a computer game (a game that is constantly
changing and evolving) is an indication of how well you know the
business world.

Win95 does not hold a monopoly on a "wierd mishmash of hardware
configs and drivers". The reason Win95 was dropped, is because
Microsoft never released a Win95 version of DX8. SOE didn't reduce
their development or support costs by going to DX8 (which cut off
Win95 users), they increased them due to all of the issues getting
older hardware (mostly video cards) to work. Many older video cards
did/do not have drivers that work under DX8, even if the user had
Win98/ME/2K/XP. The move to DX8 was done for the good of the game
despite the hit to the player base (just like the KEI-fix change).

That loud whooshing sound is the point sailing over your head. The
point being that EQ took a MUCH bigger customer hit when dropping
Win95 than the KEI-fix will ever produce. Obviously they "chose" again
to make a change to the game and risk losing customers. Your little
rants and "calls to the CEO" are meaningless. There is overwhelming
support for the change from among the player base. In fact the level
of support for the fix (some say "nerf")  is unprecedented in EQ.

How long they took to fix the problem is not really the issue. My
point (which you obviously missed again) is that they had plenty of
time to observe how KEI affected gameplay. They also had plenty of
time to weigh the costs (disgruntled customers) of fixing the high
level buff issue vs the benefits (if you can call keeping a few
customers happy at the expense of the integrity of the low level game
a benefit) of leaving the loop-hole in place.
