Speaking as a person whose main character is a level 56 enchanter I think
I'm qualified enough to say that in most cases 2 bards = 1 enchanter.  Three
intelligent rooters CAN equal one enchanter.  You didn't mention where the
raid was, but it kinda sounded like too many of your 30 people thought to
themselves "damn, enchanters are dead...we're dead...no use fighting
anymore."

I will always maintain that enchanters are the most powerful class, and
DAMNED handy to have on ANY raid, but they're never absolutely required
(unlike rogues, unless someone can tell me how to get a jade reaver without
buying it or doing the lame gravity flux/coh trick to get inside).
