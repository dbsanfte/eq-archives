You have to target the NPC first before doing any of this.  Then, hail 
them, and follow the dialog.  You generally only need to incorporate the 
bracketted part, you don't need to make real sentences.  In some cases, 
the text is misleading however.  Safest is usually "What <bracketed 
text>?"  That seems to work 99% of the time.
