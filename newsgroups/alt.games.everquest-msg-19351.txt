Yes Bard songs are considered magic and resisted the same.

Lesser Distance.

Snare, nuke and finally melee (you may think this suicide but consider a
bard to be just a caster in plate dual wielding)

If I was duelling a Druid, with my bard, I'd resort to melee while twisting
combat, dd and healing (not sure what songs are available at 27)
The Bard is likely to have around the same in HP but more AC. Running around
at a distance will just get him nuked so standing toe 2 toe would be better.
AFAIK Selo's no longer negates snare or root spells.
I don't think a bard would do to well against a caster. A bard against a non
casting melee and, as long as the Bard player knows what he is doing, I'd
say the bard can win with relative ease.

One thing I'd be careful of, in the arena, is AoE spells. Make sure that no
casters have pets out near the combat area, a high level Necro pet would
really make a dent in your day if you pissed it off.
