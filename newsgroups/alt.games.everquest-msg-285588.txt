No, gear up several tanks, heal only as absolutely necessary and everyone 
else make the effort to manage their own aggro. It's not just the tank's 
job to manage aggro. There should be a penalty associated with gaining it 
when it can and should be avoided.

That's the biggest reason I left WoW. Group sees mob. Everyone in group 
opens up on mob with both barrels. Mob dies. The risk even to the casters 
was very little.

But hey, that philosophy sure helps make the game more accessible to the 
masses.
