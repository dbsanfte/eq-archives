doh i started off a new thread with this by mistake

lvl 24 pet = research only
lvl 29 pet = grobb or ogguk (cant remember which), cos SKs get that pet but
they cant research
lvl 34 pet = research only
lvl 34 lifetap over time (forget name ) is buyable at overthere outpost too
lvl 39 pet = overthere evil outpost
lvl 44 pet = overthere evil outpost
lvl 49 pet = research only


you will easily get the words for your renew bones, 34 pet and call of bones
at the vendors in thurgadin, might take a few nights but you will get them.

the lvl 49 words drop in Timorous Deep off raptors a lot.
