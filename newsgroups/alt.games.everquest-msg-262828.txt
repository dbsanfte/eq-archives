Vanquisher is a max level warrior.

How about when people are dying cause the enchanter doesn't have his new
mez?

How about the group where we needed a mana break after every single mob
because the cleric couldn't keep up with heals.   Even though she was only
casting a max of 2 complete heals per mob?

Should we now be inspecting everyone to make sure thier gear is "up to
standard" before inviting them?  Or are you a big believer in the double
standard mentioned?

If the cleric has max mana regen and max flowing thought, if the rogues have
max worn attack and max overhaste (cause the bard has all thier level 70
songs) so things are dying immediately... then there isn't this huge need
for a tank with 50 billion hit points, who could stand up to Rallos Zek the
Warlord with only a single druid healing.    Why are you putting it all on
me to be the one that *must* have the uber gear to get invited?
