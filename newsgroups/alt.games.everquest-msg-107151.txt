Are you sure you are talking english? I only understand a few words in that
paragraph.
Technical stuff is hard for me sometimes, I try to understand but I'm
totally self taught.  It's hard when I don't have anyone around me that even
tries to understand computers.  I gotta figure out stuff by myself and can't
even discuss concepts with anyone I know so that I can make sure I really
understand.  Oh well, guess I gotta spring for some books or classes
eventually.  Any suggestions for classes I should take?
