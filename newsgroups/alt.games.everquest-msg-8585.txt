Right, pretty much only roleplayers will use backpacks now. Kind of stupid
seeing an big, fearsome ogre walking around with 4 sewing kits under each arm
:-)

I wish they would fix this but I doubt they are going to make coding changes.
Maybe make Large Sewing Kits LORE and make Cultural Large Sewing Kits LORE
and restricted to race and/or diety. That way someone could have, I think, at
most 2-3 sewing kits (generic, Coldain, and if appropiate cultural).
