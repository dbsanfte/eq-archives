A very nice summary.   Totally irrelevant, since I was talking about a loot
council situation in the original post.  (Responding to the OP, who asked if
he should be requesting every item in thier current (loot council) type of
system.)  But a nice summary none the less.

Perhaps they do.   It's a stupid idea thats wide open to abuse though.
Since we are comparing a good loot council system to a good DKP system, I'll
therefore dismiss it as an irrelevant strawman.

I've yet to see this drastic of a change after any one raid.

I never suggested price fixing items.   And we did not, in the E'ci Public
system.   Encounters did need to be set, to elmiminate any possibility of
abuse.

It wasn't in my experience.   We used the exception to "reserve" certain
items extremely sparingly.  Blade of War to Warriors first, Uber Damage
Bow_01 to Rangers first, Plane of Earth Haste Bracer to Melees first, were
the only three times I saw it invoked. (Although I'm sure non-casters would
have been restricted from high FT items, had any ever tried to bid on one.)
No items had minimum DKP prices.

I don't think I ever saw a rot at one of our raids, unless it was a truly
outdated item.  The minimum anyone could bid was 1 point, and even those who
had never attended before were allowed a 1 point spot, if they wanted the
item.  (To bid over 1 point you had to earn the points first.  Bidding more
points than you had available was punished severely.)

There were not.   It only took us one person, who set guidelines on the
amount of raid points each type of mob was worth.   Exceptions were set down
once, and remained in place until the time when that item was going for bids
of less than 100 DKP, at which point the exception rule was irrelevant.

It was a public system.  As such it had to be flexible, to allow people to
come and go as they had to during the night.   With people coming and going,
it's much easier to keep track of who was in on the kill, than to keep track
of the exact time every person showed up and left.

Again, you assume the system has to be complicated to deal with it.   It
does not.  All it needs is one trusted person who can overrule the bidding
if it must be done.

I prefer to give him both.

*shrug*   With the two exceptions of "(a very few) items restricted" and
"Raid based / time based" you just described the E'ci Public system that
you've been so busy trying to trash.

Better solution.  Overrule the bidding, give the bow to the ranger, and
watch the asshat warrior throw a fit and leave, never to be heard from
again.  Best of both worlds. = )
