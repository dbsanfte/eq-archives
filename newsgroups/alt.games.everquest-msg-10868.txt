I lack self invis, and didn't have anyone nearby to help when this jerks
whacked me. So I approached them as carefully as I could and summoned my
corpse away. They aggroed when I did this and killed me again, but this
time i tried to run through them and pull them away from my corpse.

I did get my corpse far enough away from them so I could safely drag it
away the second time.

Of course, at the time, I wasn't happy about either death. But
sometimes, it's the easiest way to get yerself free.
