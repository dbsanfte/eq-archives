I watched my brother do this quest a million times. Now that I have a
high enough Paladin, I'm trying to do the quest myself. I've run into
a problem, though. I can't for the life of me fine Lara outside of
Unrest. I've already gotten the heart from inside Unrest, but I need
to talk to Lara, and I can't friggin find her. Where is she supposed
to be exactly?
