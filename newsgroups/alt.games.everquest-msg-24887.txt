Best way to organize is by category of spell (IMO).  I have Dmg, Enchant,
Buff, Illusion, etc categories in my book and I access them with social keys
(/book 1 to page 1, /book 7 to page seven) that go to the start of the
category.  When I have a spell that has been upgraded, I move it to the back
of the section.  Works for all casters.
