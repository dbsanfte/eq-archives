Well, Carter was a graduate of the USNA, not exactly a cake-walk.  Added to
that, he was also a graduate of Naval Nuclear Power School.  I can
personally attest that NNPS isn't exactly a community college (it's the
equivalent of earning an associate's degree in a semester, with military
duties piled on).  So, as far as pure intellect goes, he most likely was the
smartest American President.

That being said, the most useless person in my division has a biology
degree, and is probably also the only enlisted person in my division to be a
college graduate.  Between him, and a few of the Junior officers, I'm not
sure I want to go to college, now.

And therein lies the problem.
