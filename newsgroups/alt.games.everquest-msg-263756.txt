Ah, I think we have the crux of it. Annie expected deference, and I
didn't give it to her. So, since I didn't give it, clearly I *expected*
it. Should I have bowed and scraped, and offered her obesience and
begged her pleasure in granting me the time to issue my request? I
certainly get that tone. What would, in any social circumstance in the
western world, be an acceptable exchange among equals is seen by you as
demanding deference. Are you even capable of seeing the miles of wrong
that is?

You might want to stay in your hothouse flower newsgroup. The rest of
usenet is a jungle. If you think that my post implied that I was
expecting deference, I suggest your grasp of English will get you into
more trouble than you're prepared for. While I suspect that your
ironclad conviction in your own fallacies may protect you to some
degree, you'll still find it vastly unpleasant.

Also, while I'm offering suggestions, please don't try to read minds -
you're abysmal at it. Perhaps you might consider getting your own mind
in order before even attempting to guess at the contents of others'. 

Apologies to Bob. I didn't intend to trigger any kind of exchange like
this. :(
