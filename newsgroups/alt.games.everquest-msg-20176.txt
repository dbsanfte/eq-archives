Hehe, if we brewers could just make Fuzzlecutters Formula 5000, brewing would have a
use. Apart from that its rather pointless, only a few quests need. I use it for
roleplay only, to make drinks at guild events.
Oh, and have earned 20pp by making a Ol' Tujims Firce Brew for a guy, and 50pp for
making a Bog Juice.
And made 100pp by showing a level 60 guy where the brewing barrel and merchant was
in WFP.

But apart from that, Brewing is rather pointless at the moment.
