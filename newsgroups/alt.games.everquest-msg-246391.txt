If you have money, you can just pump up the level to 77 or so doing
Woven Mandrake from 2 Mandrake Roots bought at the alchemy store. It's
~4pp per combine iirc. If you save the Woven Mandrake you can combine
it later with Steel Boning to get Picnic baskets for Misty Thicket
Picnics. I can understand if you're just trying to build as you
progress in game though.. but if you don't mind paying some.. its a
faster way.

After that.. i would usually rape Crystal Caverns for Crystalline
Spider Silk... those combines take you to like 130.
