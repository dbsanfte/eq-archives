Aye, It was just sarcasm.

I couldn't help thinking that if there ever were a popular MMPORG that
worked with only 1 server (world) that included several hundred thousand
players,  all of us posting on these newsgroups would be on the same server
:-)

What a force we could be !

hmmm.... of course.....

That would mean I would be on the same server as Bizbee  :-p

(sorry biz)
