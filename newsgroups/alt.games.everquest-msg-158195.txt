}Uh - those ARE realdolls on that site :) It's a site some guy set up

}many, but there's a picture of some shades-of-auchwitz bed showing
}about a half dozen.  He has little roleplaying sessions with them,
}too.  He has a section on how to repair them when they get 'torn'
}(meep).  I'm just saying the official realdoll site is nothing
}compared to some of the 'fansites' out there.

/em has another look at that site.

Good god...

/em feels like an amateur.

Think I'll stick to the Real Live Human brand though.  Just can't beat 
features like free will and self-awareness.  Plus, they're slightly cheaper. 
:) 

I was a bit disappointed when I picked up PoP at Best Buy last night and it 
came with no doll whatsoever, though.

}I'd point you to goatsex, but that's going from nasty to downright
}evil.

Yeah, and I've seen it. :)
