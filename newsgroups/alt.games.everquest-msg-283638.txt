A few things to watch for when you feign.

1) At least as a monk, if you have auto attack on when you feign it
will fail.  At least this was true a year or so ago.  I dont know if
the spell FD is different because when I feign on my necro, I never
have attack on.

2) If you get hit by a spell after the feign goes off, it will be
broken and you will not appear dead to any mobs.  You will get a
message when this happens.

3) Feign, both spell and /disc, can fail.  If it fails, you will get
the message that you have fallen to the ground.  Watch for this and
consider using an audio trigger to make sure you are aware.  Audio
triggers are under actions through the big "EQ" button.

Something you will want to be careful about is always load feign after
you die.  Dont accept a rez and dont go on a CR without FD up.  Not
sure if you had it up here but this is just another good habit to get
in to.

There are very few cures in the game for the malo/mala/etc line of
spells.  I think RGC will get it and I know that AA cures will get it
off.

Tash, however, can be cures with a simple cure poison.

When you log in, you will not be dead.  You will have full HP and mana
so you can go ahead and log right in and take your chances.  But you
will also have the option to return home at the character select
screen.  Press this and you just go back to your home town with no
death.

You may need to train yourself to watch the "begins to cast a spell"
message and make sure you let the spell hit you before you cast.  (Or
conversly, if you are kiting, make sure all mobs are chasing.  If one
stops, it is casting)  You can also snare a caster and run around a
corner so that it cant cast another spell.  Let that last spell hit you
then feign.

> Mobs don't reliably leave when you FD, either, they may just hang out.

They almost always do after a while.  There have been bugs in the past
where they just never roamed back but I havent seen this in a long
time.  However if a mob is snared, generally, it will not roam back.
Clinging and engulfing darkness may be an exception because they do not
reduce movement rate enough.  But in any case your higher-level snares
will freeze a mob in its track even if it is not agroed.  (Some warp
back but most just stand there)  This will be a great pulling tool for
you in the future.  Just keep in mind that at some point, just because
they have begun roaming back, they have not fogotten you and if you
stand, you will reagro.  It can be tricky too because if you stand,
their pathing will sometimes take them back to their spawn (at a run)
and then back at you.  You will just have to play with feigning to
figure out the finer points.

That'll change when a pet lasts exactly 1 combat round.  =)

Yeah but you get an invis spell anyway...

You know if you want, you can also jump in the hole.  Make sure you hit
a few bridges on the way down and you will not take the 20k.  But be
ready to feign at the bottom.
