 Being a Monk basically I just try holding off the mobs as long as
possible then feigning when I get down to 20% health. Hopefully most
people have gotten a good lead over the mobs. Feign also not failing is
nice. This allows me to either let the group know when it's safe to come
back or drag the corpses someplace to make rezing easier.

 Anyway, depending on where you are, running may not be an option. Even
if it is sometimes it's just fun to stand your ground and see what
happens. Sure, you may die most of the time, but those times you live
usually end up being the most fun fights you'll have in EQ. If you gate
everytime you are OOM and there are more mobs that you think you can
handle, you'll be gating a lot. Not to mention word may get around that
you you gate out all the time when the going gets rough.
