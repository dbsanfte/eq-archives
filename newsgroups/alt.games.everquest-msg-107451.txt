anyone else get a big arrow that sticks in the middle of their screen when
they log into EQ.  i never got it before i had win xp, but since i upgraded
it has been there.  its like this on 2 of my computers, one with a nvidia 64
and one with an ati 32 and both have the newest drivers. any idea how to
correct this or what causes it, and does it happen to anyone else?
