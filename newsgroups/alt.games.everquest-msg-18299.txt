No but are we playing a game or a simulation?

If its a game then the makers should try and make the game
as fun as possible to the player and remove any boring or
tedious parts, or at least make those parts optional depending
on what the player wants to do.

If its a simulation then count me out, most simulations are boring
and fall short of being true simulations. The technology just isnt
there yet. Well, its not affordable yet to the average person anyway.

I think more people would play in more places, if an automap/cartography skill
was included. Many people complain about being in over-crowded
zones. Look at Oasis or LOIO. While other zones go empty.
I think part of that comes from safety and convenience but it also comes
from the fear of having to go on a long trip or a corpse recovery in
strange new zone or even just plain getting lost and wasting time
running in circles.
