As a high elf enchanter who has been in Neriak numerous times, (usually
DE and invisible, for those times when invis drops), and killed a
bizillion orcs, Dvinn, and Dorn, I can tell you that I can carry out most
transactions.

BUT, once at lvl ~24 I got overconfident, did some banking came 
wandering out from the bank in Neriak and the guards near the zone 
set on me and killed my little DE ass.

I can also stand in front of the felwithe guards and change into any
form I want and the worst I get from them is warmly, "Oh that is just
that Arnarn again acting like a skeleton again".

One time in Steamfont I had changed into an air elemental, (as I often
do in rough terrain), was sitting by the windmills chatting with some
friends and must have drifted to close to the guard and he killed me
dead, (anyone ever notice that whatever elemental form you use when you
come back to your corpse it always is an earth elemental and looks like 
a turd with your stuff sticking out of it). We had been there for some
time, so I can only surmise that I had edged my faction into the red.

I went back and conned the guard, (the only thing I have ever killed in
Staemfont was Minos and yard trash), and I conned indifferent, so not
now I am much more careful about what illusions I use where.
