This would make sense if MB was a good way to do this.  For 99% of
the fights in the game, MB isn't the way to go.  For MB to make sense,
you need to either be able to insta-kill something that would otherwise
be difficult, or the mob has to have a tremendous regen rate or absolutely
crippling damage output such that making the kill faster is far more important

than making it efficiently.

MB damage ratio per mana spent (barring lucky criticals, which cannot be
counted on) is worse than any nuke in a 60 wizard's arsenal.  If they
are going to have the time to do so, they are much better off casting
several regular nukes over the run of the fight, instead of blowing their
entire wad (and a couple hours for refresh time) on a faster casting
nuke.

If I told you I could spend 1000 mana to do 2000 damage, or 500
mana to do 1500 damage, plus 5 seconds later another 500 mana
to do a second 1500 damage, which spell would you want me to use?

If the mob was going to die in one shot from 2000 damage, then the
first would make sense... this is where you get the 1% where MB
is useful.

Currently, MB is used more than that by some guilds, because
laying in a healthy mod rod supply means MB plus get back up
to FM and do regular nuke damage... the fact that MB is fast
matters far more here than how efficient it is.  Since Mod capability
is also being nerfed, MB is no longer the big "beginning of the
fight" bonus.  That nerf, not the "MB don't stack" nerf, is the
real blow to MB... yet that nerf doesn't amount to "nuke for gold"
