I've seen it, just not since SOL was released and FV became a ghost
town.  Some folks even went out in pairs of groups, one good and one
evil (the evil group would deal with those pesky KSing butterfly-
things whose name I can't recall).

Actually the drachnid's pathing leads them to cluster frequently in
many spots throughout their range, and most of those same areas will
be devoid of them about as often as they are full of them.  I've
never seen more than 6 close to the tunnel, barring a train, but I've
seen over a dozen up along the wall between the tunnel and LOIO when
the zone had been empty other than me for at least five minutes
(fortunately only two of them had see invis up and my young Druid was
able to dodge around them).  That ebb and flow from their pathing is
what makes it possible to run between LOIO and FV with no help (as a
naked non-invis un-SoWed Warrior, for instance) if you are observant,
careful, and don't take a big lag hit at the wrong time.
