Even though it will do no good and 99% of the people out there already
have a canned responce to the topic heres my 0.2 coppers worth.

ALL the solo classes are getting left behind and slowly fading. There
are fewer Necros, Mags, and yes even Druids being played, the holy
trinity of solo after a fashion. The reason for this is simple. Verant
has made the two typical mistakes of most dugeon games. Godhood for
players though items acquired and the lack of a good grouping system.
Any dugeon masters guide for the old Dungeon and Dragons game warned
that allowing this to happen ruins the game, and they were very
correct. Whats happened is the mobs must be made so powerful to
withstand a group of "Ubers", that indeed become more than the sum of
their parts, so no one player has the possiblity to handle mobs in
many zones. To complicate matters the current system of grouping is
just flat broke and we all know it. Beyond the fact that you cant just
go get a pickup group in the mid to high 50s and expect to live.

That an Verants active role in killing solo means there will be fewer
of these classes played in the future. Verants role you say? Well you
have to dig a bit to see which classes verant promotes and which ones
they dont. For instance:

Chanters -  Power has increased greatly just in the last year, Bah if
you like but to see a chanter not able to get a group it is an event
worth noting. Simply put there is no suitable replacement class.

Bards - Dont think this even needs mention as anyone who has ever
played a blueberry knows they got away with murder and are busy
denieing they were even there.

Warrior / Rouge - Gawd the Armor and weapon upgrades lately are
insane. True the mobs and prices are now insane hence my point. 

Clerics - Critical heals??? Come on they arent even trying to hide it
are they. But also needed now due to the strength of the mobs out
there.

Wizzies - See above and multiply by 10. manna burn?? I want some of
what verants designers have been smoking.

These are the golden boys and the ones the game is centered around the
rest are left with the gleanings.

Mags got dam little, Necros and Druid got only insults.
