Warcraft rocked my world, way back when, WC2 was pretty good as well, but 
I was getting a bit burnt out by then. WC3 hasn't done a thing to pull me 
back in. The game seems like it would take way too much scrolling around 
for me.

If they can make *any* improvements in game mechanics and class balancing 
in EQ2, I really don't see how it could fail. I will definitely be 
checking it out.

Though I'm a big Star Wars fan, this game hasn't really appealed to me 
very much. Maybe I'll give it a try at some point.
