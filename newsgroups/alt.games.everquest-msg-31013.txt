I find my Iksar Shadowknight has no trouble at all finding groups, and they
seem to do extremely well on all the raids I've been on. He also solos very
well, has lots of cool armor and IMHO the best newbie areas of the game
(FOB, LOiO, SoNH and WW). You get a semi-useless pet and mediocre spells,
but you also get double-attack, FD, Fear, Shadow Step and natural regen.

Yes - you are KOS everywhere except Cabilis, but so far that hasn't had much
impact on my play. BTW did you know those little Halfling Deputies have a
HUGE aggro range? They must be compensating for something...

Skayle (aka Drywit)
