Ro Armor.  Soil of Underfoot requires Faerie dust.  I know, it's
kinda dated, along with camping the Shin Lord for Ghoulbane.  Still
irritates me tho, was always my pet bitch about TheVision(tm).
For all that, I miss TheVision(tm).  EQ then was the best computer game
I'd ever played when I started, and its current incarnation is now the
best computer game I've ever played, and I believe that would not be
true if it weren't for Brad's relentless focus on his vision, warts and
all.  Fortunately, there seems to be enough resilience in the game to
withstand all the ease-of-use tinkering they're doing.  I'm still
having fun, at any rate.
