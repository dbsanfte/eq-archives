 >According to some lawmakers, writing in your

>doing just that.  

Get your facts straight. The person arrested for his diary was a child
molestor on parole. He violated the terms of that parole when it was
discovered that he was writing fantasies in his diary that involved
children. By violating the terms of that parole he gave up his right
to freedom and was returned to prison to finish his sentance. This
individual was NOT innocent. He was a convicted felon, and his actions
indicated that he was not reformed and still a danger to society.

This was not the whim of lawmakers.

>When did I ever say that stealing is ok?  Never did I do either.  You are incorrectly inferring it.

When you describe in detail how to steal you are planting the seed of
an idea into someone elses head. Your description and the details you
provided "inferred" that it was not only possible to steal a CD-Key,
but that it was also fairly simple to do.

You set yourself up for "flaming" when you suggested and outlined a
plan to steal a CD-Key. Don't try to hide behind some flimsy excuse.
