To be blunt, you're a fucking idiot.

You're level 57.  Get to level 62, head to BoT.  Go tank a krieger and
come back and tell me how well that proc/taunt/disarm/slam holds
aggro.

As a level 65 monk, I can tell you right now, only a well played
Paladin/SK can keep aggro off me.  Even a well played warrior, unless
they are armed with that uber, 700-hate point proccing weapon from
RZTW, they aren't keeping aggro the entire fight reliably.
