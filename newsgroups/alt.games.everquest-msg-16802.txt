Did you consider /report?  His conduct falls under the rule against
in-game fraud.  Probably would not have got your money out of it, but
if everyone he commits minor fraud on reports him, when someone
petitions him for something big, the GMs might remember all the minor
fraud and be more sympathetic to whomever is reporting him for something
big.
