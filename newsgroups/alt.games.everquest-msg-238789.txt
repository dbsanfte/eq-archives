I've done *some* tradeskills in EQ, but I'm not a fanatic. However, in 
SWG, tradeskills are the breath and bone of some classes, particularly 
the architect. And the amount of material you have to harvest (or buy, 
but that cuts the bottom out of any potential profits) will have you 
visiting the carpal tunnel doctor fast. And it's about all you can do if 
you're running a thriving business.

Plus, you couldn't take off from the game for any period of time without 
tearing a bunch of stuff down. If I got called away for a few days 
unexpectedly, I'd come back to a million credit loss from all my 
harvesters burning down.
