    One of the big issues here is the warrior's role in an XP group. Groups
just don't want warriors in them if they can get a paladin or SK instead.
The knight gives them the ability to go all-out with DPS, gives them HPs or
ATK, gives them healing and/or mana regen, and even can serve as a puller
(lull/feign) without killing everyone. The warrior... lets them kill tough
mobs for XP. But by the time a mob is tough enough for you to see a
difference between the two tanks, it's no longer an XP mob. So this is
hurting the casual player today - the casual warrior.
