Find a quiet safe spot. (a good idea is some place you can fish, so you have
something to do while you med, or bring a book to your computer desk)
Cast a pet. Make a hot button that casts minor sheilding, Locate Corpse, and
Ward Undead. Make sure you have the pet targeted. Hit these over and over ad
naseum. The one advantage to me making cheese was casting a pet and nuking
it over and over when I had mana. Got Evocation over a 100... but still not
as good as it could be.

Also, buff yourself and your pet at every opportunity. That will help keep
your ABJ near maxed- mine is 164 which isn't horrible for a 36 necro.
