It was working fine for me last night, maybe just a fluke but was lvl 48
last night and my next pet spell is 49 so before the patch I would summon
only green pets, until I dinged 49 last night all the pets I summoned were
light blue so I figured it was fixed ;)

Oh, one other question about pets, with the new pet command window, is there
a way to change which /pet commands show up there? I don't use /pet get lost
much but do use /pet report health a lot and would like to change them.

TIA
