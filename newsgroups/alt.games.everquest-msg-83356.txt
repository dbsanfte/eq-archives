And you would be playing right into my hands!  Zymyool mas created as a 
mule character that would make free jewelry for my guild.  I took MyMule, 
changed the spelling to mymyool, and changed the leading M to a Z so that 
it would show up last on my char selection list.

I decided to actually play an enchanter one day and enjoyed it.  His stats 
were good enough, so he became my main.  I hate the name, though, so please 
petition away.

Report Pheilmi ( sounds like "feel me" to some people ) while you are at 
it.  I didn't get the surname I wanted, so the first name is of no 
importance to me and I another I would much prefer.
