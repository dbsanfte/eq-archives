 Keep two things in mind-

Everquest- The game
 When I am playing in EQ, I am there too help others. If I see someone in
trouble, I will jump at the chance to help. Thus I probably make a freind
for a long time to come. I believe it is a game of teamwork and respect for
others. I do not care too much for decimating newbies, just because they are
newbies. We were all there at one time, and I have some people help me along
the way that are still good friends in game. I welcome all with open arms.

Everquest - The Newsgroup
 When I first posted in here, it seemed to be open season for a new poster.
I was attacked and basically told that if I don't know the game, then I
should leave this private little club. I retaliated, spoke my peace, and
left shortly after. I would return once in a while to catch up on changes,
or up-coming events. The more I read, the more I got angry. It don't matter
who you are, a certain group feel compelled to direct control over this
newsgroup like a club. I compare it too the KKK or Black Panthers greeting
party. It wasn't about what you said, it was about the fact that you were
new and just needed to be bashed.

 I will always try and be a polite sincere player in game, because that's
the way it should be. In here ?, no way, no how. I have seen too many people
ran off just because they didn't fit the mold of these racist,
discriminatory pigs that think they can run a public NG. I don't break, I
retaliate to the point that you have no choice but to block me. Now, out of
respect for the NG, I usually try and keep it to one thread. That was, it
can be brought out in the open without flooding the NG with a bunch of
worthless crap.


 Just my .02ï¿½
