Sounds like you had a couple of clueless players in your group (or 1
player dual-boxing 2 PCs and accounts). If you join a lot of pickup
groups, you are going to run into idiots from time to time.

1. Never loot until all the fighting is done (ESPECIALLY if you are
the main tank).
2. Warrior *MUST* use taunt to keep the creatures focused on him. This
may mean switching between multiple targets and hitting/taunting them
to get their attention.
3. The Cleric should be using Root to park adds away from the combat
or fear to send them away for a little while (Only using fear when
they are sure the creature won't return with adds).
4, Rogue should be using Hide/Evade to lower agro while backstabbing
for damage. The rogue may have to wait and not enter combat until the
Warrior has gotten the attention of all the creatures you are
fighting.

Your role as a Rogue is to deal damage (not take damage)

1. Position yourself behind the creature you are fighting
2. Backstab
3. Use *Hide/Evade to lower your agro (the creatures "hate" for you)
so that it stays focused on the main tank (in the case above the
warrior).

Rogues are a grouping class. I suggest that you learn as much as you
can about the other classes and their roles/abilities. That way you
will know when you are grouped with a decent player and when you are
grouped with an idiot.

Basic group roles (Many classes can cross over to other roles. This is
just a quick "rule of thumb" list)...

"Tanks" (Damage absorbers) = WAR, PAL, SHAD
"Melee Damage Dealers = ROG, MNK, RAN, BEAS
"Healers/Buffers" = SHA, DRU, CLR
"Damage over Time" = NEC
"Nukers" = MAG, WIZ
"Crowd Control" = ENCH (and to a lesser extent all root capable
classes)
Almost of the above = BARD :-)


*If you haven't already, setup a social hotkey for this and name it
Evade
/attack off
/doability # (where # is the slot you have the hide skill mapped to)
/attack on
