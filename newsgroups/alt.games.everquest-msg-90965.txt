No.  You can only be affected by one spell (or song) hate at a time and one
Item haste at a time.  If you have more than one item, the highest single item
will be used.

See above.  Haste does not stack.  A weapon with the hasted ratio that does
not list haste could be speeded up by a FBSS or other similar item.

Bash is the disadvantage, and perhaps a bit of stamina.  The small size is
actually an advantage, IMO.  (Dwarf warlord here.)

Not much.   A small group could camp the hangman's noose from the Trak's Teeth
Hunter / Forager chains.  Although you'd have to park the twink there to loot
it.
