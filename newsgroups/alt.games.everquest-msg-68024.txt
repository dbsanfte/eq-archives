Hey Dan - I know you were wrestling with SB and Win2k at one point (just like
everyone else).

Since going to DX8.1 I've noticed the sound has dramatically improved and even
am back up to 'full accelleration'.  Out of 6 2+ hour sessions playing SoL, ONE
night I had some stutter problems and that was whilst in Tim Deep sitting on the
boat.  Had to do the usual, 'move just a little' and it would stop stuttering on
the silly boat bell sound.

Other than that, EAX now works and no other zones have caused stutters.
