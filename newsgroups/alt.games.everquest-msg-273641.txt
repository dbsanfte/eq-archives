I don't know that I've seen more of it lately, I generally play on the RP 
servers -- in part because I feel this provides a greater chance of avoiding 
those types -- and it doesn't seem to come up there very often.  But I'll 
share another perspective below.

I've thought about this issue and wondered why it bothers me to see people 
speak like that. Am I a language snob? I mean, the goal is communication, 
right? If the message is coming across, why should it bother me that someone 
is using abbreviations like ur, ne1one, plz, grp, and so on? What is it 
about these idioms that sets them apart from afk, brb, brt, omw, and for 
that matter, Gratz! All of these terms have significant currency even on the 
RP servers I frequent. Purists like Dark Tyger might not use them, but I'll 
confess that I do and many, many others do too and not infrequently. If I'm 
making my way over to an event I may say "On griffin in Ant3, omw", or "Afk 
for bio, brb". Is this fundamentally any different?

On the issue of increased frequency lately, I'll tell you where I do see it. 
My son (who moved out years ago) plays WoW and my wife and I have accounts 
there that enable us to have fun interacting with him online. You would not 
*believe* how utterly rare it is there to see anything approaching an 
English sentence, either in the trade channels or in local communications. 
It is absolutely standard to use terms like "ne1one", "ur" and "plz" and I'm 
sure I seem like an oddball when I say "You're welcome" instead of "np". In 
my experience, EverQuest2's raunchiest inhabitants are more respectful of 
the language than the people we run into routinely throughout WoW. There 
*is* a difference and it's not subtle.
