    Eeeek! No AC = bad item, unless it's a main hand slot item. These go in
the Serp Bracer dustbin.

    Strong advice. Arm slot is historically weak for WIS casters. Only two
items spring to mind....

    This is one of them. ;-) Don't worry about lost DEX - only good for
training up weapon skills anyways.

    You'd THINK they'd be cheap, but with essentially all lower-level SHM,
CLR and DRU wanting them I find the price on my mature server pushes 750.

    The second item that comes to mind is Hollowed Bone Bracers (despite the
name, it is an arm item). This drops in Najena, off of Rathyl. A group of
low 20's would be able to break in to his area and camp him with sound
tactics and no panic attacks. They are AC 6 MANA 15 Sv. Magic 7, so at your
level they give as much mana as a WIS 3 or 4 item, roughly. If you want to
see what other alternatives are out there, go to:

    Good luck!
