Hmm could have sworn when I had my alt druid as back up healer for our
kitty group that he was foraging roots while getting "You are thirsty"
messages.  I wasn't making notes for a scientific treatise on the
subject but I do seem to recall cussing quite a bit when I'd pull out
another root heh.  Does this rule not apply on the moon for some reason
perhaps?  Zone was Dawnshroud as I recall.

His forage has always seemed off to me though.  My primary druid piles
up supplies and has since he was quite young, but this alt druid forages
when ever possible and both his skill lvl and results have been very
poor compared to the first one.
