I think this aspect of the game does continue to exist, its just that it 
only exists at the high end of the game, where the no drop gear starts 
to beat any bazaar buyable stuff you can lay your hands on for any price.

Level Restricted is another way to deal with the problem; if the gear 
can't be worn till 55, and can be looted from mobs you can kill at 55, 
then it doesn't matter as much that it can be bazaar purchased at level 
6.  Trouble is, since most droppable items aren't level restricted, the 
ones that are don't kill the whole problem.
