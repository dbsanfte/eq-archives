Agreed. There was by the way a similar 'even't in LOIO. A few magician
skeletons rushed the mill and started zapping around. They had sowlike
speed etc and were clearly GM controlled. I followed a few with my
51 shammie, which they tried to attack, but only lost their pets
very quickly in return (I didn't even do anything, my pet did). I 
could not hurt the GM skeletons themselves, though, as they seem to
have a level limit of what can hurt them. I followed it aorund till I
found a few newbies, which I subsequently sowed and buffed, healed etc
which the GM did not expect and died. Was quite funny, but the corpses
at the mill made me think it's not exactly fair to the lower levels.
If GM's kill one player .. happens .. if they just flatten 10 people
medding in the relative security of the mill however, it strikes me
as stupid. Ah well .. I had my fun there, but it's because the level
made me basically invulnerable to the GM's.
