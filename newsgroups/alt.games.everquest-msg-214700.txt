Interesting, I wonder if when you were running around using your
/corps hot key you may have inadvertently passed near your corps and
dragged it to where you found it. My experience has been that even
when you have more than one corps in the dungeon, after the time
expires one of the appears outside the dungeon door with all your
equipment. In fact in one adventure, there was such a pile of corpses,
it was difficult for my druid to find its corps to click on and drag.
