Tosh. Bizbee was using the word to illustrate the attitude displayed;
that of a particular subset of people (druids/blacks) being seen as
de-facto there to serve, and of an inferior nature, by those taking
advantage of them. The parallel is just fine.

'Nigger' is not a synonym for 'Slave' - it has far more exploitative
and specific connotations of the relationship of disrespectful, assumed,
and *unthinking* exploitation. You exist to port me, Boy. Why would
you be upset at the natural order?

Its racist to call someone else something derogatory; its not racist
to reference an attitude you feel is being displayed towards yourself.
