As long as you or any from your group do ANY damage to the mob, you'll get
full exp for the kill.
This doesn't work for dire charmed pets, who still abide the old rules.

As a result it's quite a good tactic to just pull with a very low level dam
spell (I use a ceramic band for pulling now, 5 dam max) and then heal-pet or
chain-pet tactic. You could do this before the change, but you'd always get
half exp.

Very mana efficient, I almost never go below 60% mana while soloing with
this method. And the 60% is only gotten because every damn buff on me and my
pet wears off.
