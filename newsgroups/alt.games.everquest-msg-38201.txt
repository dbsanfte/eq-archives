Well, according to Castersrealm, your suggestion is what is actually in
the article: horses won't let you move faster than a "skilled" player
can already move, so mob speeds won't be changed.  It appears Everlore
misread the article.

My guess is that Verant said no to horses for so long because they
couldn't think of a good way to do them (go ride a rowboat around for a
while, and you'll see what I mean!).  They came up with a clever way
that avoids all those problems--make the horse part of the player model.
As far as the game engine is concerned, there is no horse...just a funny
looking player.

Still, I'm a bit surprised, if they are doing this.  It doubles the
number of player models they need.  That's a lot of work.

On the other hand...they are definitely starting to worry about
competition, so something like this makes sense.
