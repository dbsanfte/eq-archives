When starting new characters, certainly relative load makes a
difference. But when I play, I go in with the intent to play a certain
character, and I play on whatever server that character is on, without
regard to how many others are on it.

Why not, when choosing a server upon which to start a new character,
just select one around the middle of the load order? Same effect, and
no raw numbers are needed.


Don't get me wrong, the numbers are nice to have, but they are in no
way essential to playing and enjoying the game.
