When you get to the Singing Bush, say the magic chant and fire your
gun in the air*.  This will summon the Invisible Swordsman who will
take you to the island.



*Fire your gun IN THE AIR.  Lackadasically firing towards the horizon
could lead to inadvertent death of the IS, and you lose the quest
components.  El Guapo won't spawn with all his loot.
