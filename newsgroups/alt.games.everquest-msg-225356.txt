I simply base that on the fact that in the recent past the game has gotten
more and more group-oriented. I doubt they're going to revamp something that
affects that many basic aspects of the game without isolating it on its own
server. And I don't think they believe it's a problem. Much like the PVP or
RP servers, I see this as something that they could create to attract a
niche market that otherwise gets somewhat lost in the shuffle (or the
Vision, if I decide to get snotty about it.  ;)  ).

It's not that it wouldn't be possible, just that it's not likely. As for
practical, well... Some of the PVP servers (from what I hear) are rather
underpopulated. But they're still running them because there are some people
there. And those people (I can only assume) are having fun and enjoying a
different sort of gameplay than the majority.
