Its the basic differnce in any RPG, online or not, between a class and a
skill based game. THe problem computing wise with a skill based game is
you usually end up with weird effects when you add new content and a re
forced to open up scales, or to leave skill scales open ended and with no
content.

Levels do deaden this off to some extent. EQ sort of does this by having
some skills tied to a cap and others being independant. However class
skills are still core. Its also a very very handy way of doing steadily
incremental magic...you can do it skill wise by using skill caps but
desiging it is a bit of a nightmare - running the code is trivial as
compared to doing the same in pen and paper.

You could 'level' people and give them points per level that they buy
abilities with and classes set the skills to choose from or have free
skill choice with class affecting cost to some degree....PLanetside sorta
do this with their ticket system and there was space MMORPG which escapes
me name wise that did something similar. Even the D20 pen and paper
everquest does something like this. THe problem as far as computer gaming
goes is that without specialists there generally gets to be a 'best' way
to play - the same way there is an ideal group config etc...UO got round
it with severe limits to character skillsets IIRC but thats the bugbear of
the design - everyone ending up the same. Not because of an inherent
problem with skill systems but usually biases from the design of the
challenges or the current area of dev in a game. A pen n paper DM can
correct in their game at a table for areas of design favour but a MMORPG
cant
