Me too, and I'm religious. ^^  If my mom weren't religious *and* non-
approving of swearing in 99% of forms (she did think the swearing bits 
in Happy Gilmore were hilarious, but only because they were bleeped out 
;)) I'd have it hanging in my room.  I tell you, if the 10 Commandments 
had *actually* been worded like that, I bet people'd take em a little 
more seriously :D
