Wow. All the way to level 1 before you got bored, huh? You must get bored
real easy.
And I can see where you get all your expertise on what a necro can do,
having leveled a necro all the way to level 1.

I would put up HS before fearing the pet, because you may get the HT before
you are done casting. Also remember that your pet has to do more damage than
you in order to get the king to attack him.

I would take out the shaman first though, because left alone he will start
healing the king.
