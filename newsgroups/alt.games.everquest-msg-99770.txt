That's just it - it wouldn't take that many 55+ pc's to take
Vox and Naggy.  I would guess that a single group of 60's with
many AA levels could take either of these.  That's why the 
level 52 limit.  It was a Kludge to fix the balance problem
caused by raising the level limit.  Hate and Fear had to be
completely revamped to handle it.

Also, raising the level cap will require rebalancing classes
against one another, in the same way that raising it to 60
*dramatically* changed the balance between casters and melee.

When he said levels, he could just as easily have been talking
about increasing available AA levels and max AA points.
