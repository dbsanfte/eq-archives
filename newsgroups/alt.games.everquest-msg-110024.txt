What i ment by this is, any mud programmer can write a basic system to make
things work or hack at existing code, like lets say, i wanted to add meteor
storms and earthquake and such, id find the weather part do a little bit of
hacking and wala. The only hard part a mud coder probably couldnt do is the
animations....Yet a mud coder could send the client text Theres an
Earthquake Rumbling, would be generic but in sense it would work :P

Hmm last time i checked eqemu.org they seem to have battle and magic
working, guess that means it does nothing tho.
If it did take 7 years it wasnt the engine or client programming, it would
of probably been all the maps, models, and animations that they did, which i
proposed to re use. The only thing besides that to do would be, the network
code, and the drag and drop interface. Using quake theres enough tutorials
and snippets around to emulate the client as long as the network code is
complete.
Blah legal smegal, obiously the team wouldnt distribute everquest graphics,
there would be some sort of utility to extract them. Sort of like freecraft,
which i don't see Blizzard knocking on there door.
