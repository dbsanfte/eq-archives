... It wasn't well balance for the trials, that was my point. It ended
up sucking horribly when we tried to get the SK through the trials.
Ended up calling in friends with a 65 monk and shaman from our
resident uberguild to replace me and the chanter and it was a breeze. 

But that group  is well-balanced in the sense that we can handle
pretty much any exp camp in a tier 2 or 3 zone. We won't take even a
PoS mini, of course and those unslowable greater pusslings or Elite
knights in COD can still get hairy if the warrior isn't on or has
popped defensive already but we manage quite well, thank you very
much. 

The change in flags just means that now we can add some friends that
might be high 50s, do a mini-raid with 2 groups and actually take em
to some places that are out of their league. Something we used to do a
lot of pre-pop. Some of my coolest EQ memories are tagging along to
places I had no business being, mid 45s in Seb doing Jumpy and Prot,
low 50s doing the chetari tunnels in DN, SG or 2nd floor hate. Now
things like that have opened up again. Trips like that just opened up
again because we're not tied to the lowest common denominator as far
as flags go.
