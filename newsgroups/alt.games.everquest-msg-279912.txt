[snipped list of cleric spells that got upgrades]

Please list the spells for any class that were original and useful.  ALL of
them were numbers upgrades, or numbers upgrades on unused spell lines.

Some classes had the added insult that the numbers upgrades weren't even
upgrades in effectiveness, just a required speedbump upgrade so the spell
would affect the mobs we're now fighting.

Enchanters are the ones I know best; previous mez, stun, charm, and pacify
spells just stopped working (because higher-level mobs became the normal
targets) until new spells were acquired that do the exact same
thing on new mobs.  Heck, for pacify and charm we had to get new spells just
to have a nerfed version!  And two of our most effective lines got dropped
entirely until the June 29 patch.

Imagine if your upgrades were "most of your heal spells don't work on anyone
over L65, the new versions work the same, but on higher-level targets.  Except
the new CH, which is the last L70 spell for you and now has a 15 second
cast time and can't crit.

Complaining that your upgrades were uninteresting makes me feel even worse
that my upgrades were either zero-grades or nerfs.  But then I get over it,
and realize that I'm still having fun, despite SoE hating me :)  When that
stops, I'll stop playing.

OTGH, some new AAs WERE interesting and useful, and the July 29 patch added
two (boring numbers upgrades, but for good spells) important enchanter spells.
