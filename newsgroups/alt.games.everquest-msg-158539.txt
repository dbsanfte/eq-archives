Hmm.  Haven't used the heals yet, as they tend to look, well...
nonexistant, next to ANY other healer's heals. :)  I do use vampiric
curse a lot (took me awhile since I read the castersrealm explanation
on vampiric embrace first) now that I'm soloing, so I assume that
casting this + shadow compact would basically = a heal-over-time with
no hp loss for me :)

Thanks, that gives me more of a general idea of what my role is in a
group.  Now how do I get the clerics to stop healing me? ;)
