There's about eleventy different versions of linux.  When I was into it a 
year or so ago, the only 7-CD version was Suse.  There was also a version 
that fit on a single floppy disk.  Yes, the single floppy version was CLI.  
Personally, I preferred CLI to GUI.  Pointing devices are the bane of 
mankind.

The version I used most, debian, fit on 7 floppy disks.  It included your 
choice of 6-7 different customizable GUIs in that space.

The reason some were much bigger is a function of the additional perks 
included.  On the 7-disk Suse distro, you got about 100 games, and 10-20 
different word processors, a half dozen spreadsheets, scientific software 
for fourier analysis, development environments for Pascal, C, Fortran, 
Ada, Forth, Basic, and any other language you can think of, graphics 
utilities, sound editing utilities, etc, etc, as well as complete 
documentation and source code for the whole nine yards.

If you sold Windows bundled with Office, Photoshop, and all the microsoft 
development environment goodies, it'd probably be pretty big too. :)

But compare my 7-disk floppy version with the floppy version of Windows95 
I have somewhere... which spanned 30 disks.  There's your code bloat. :)
