I don't remember where, but I just recently read an interesting article on
the appearence of classic rock songs in so many commercials nowadays, and in
fact in most cases, it *is* done with approval of the artist.  They get a
heck of a lot more money from one of those commercials than they do from
album sales or radio play of those old songs, even when they are classics.
