Tactic if you are going to be fighting mobs that cast spells (treants, evil
eyes, etc):

Get a low level buff on yourself first, one that you don't need. Get all your
buffs. Click on the first buff to cancel it. You now have an empty enchantment
slot *above* all your other buffs. Engage in combat.

If you get a spell that is not good -- charm, root, languid pace, etc -- it
will go in to *the first empty slot*, which would be the one at the top.
Cancel magic will remove the enchantment/buff *in the first filled slot*,
which will be, because of your clever planning, the one you want to get rid
of.

We Americans do not have a right to oversee
our leaders, to demand upfront accountability
of their actions and to question their every
decision; this is the moral imperative and
duty of every citizen.
