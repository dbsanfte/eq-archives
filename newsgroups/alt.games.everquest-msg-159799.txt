Kaesora is my 2nd favorite zone - right after Dalnir.  Our solid group went 
to Kaesora after Dalnir, and it really helped that 2 of the people had been 
there and knew it very well.

We had 2 WAR, 1 CLC, 1 SMH, 1 BRD, 1MNK, usually.  Once in a while, the SHM 
or MNK wouldn't be there.  I don't recall our levels, but if you search for 
posts by Zymyool with the word Kaesora in it ( I may have spelled it with 2 
Ss ), you can read what we did and what levels we were.

I -think- we did Kaesora from levels 35-40.  This was usually with a full 
party of 6 people who played VERY well together.  Having a porter will help 
because once you go "in" you can't get back out the same way.  When you go 
in, you will go down the ramp and take a left and jump off a ledge.  There 
will be spiders in this area, you'll have to kill them and then take over 
the room to the right ( 4 spawn room? ).  We usually set up base here until 
we got the spawn timing down, and then we would head further in through the 
door.  If you go out the right doorway from this setup room, that is how 
you get back out.  We didn't have anyone to transport us, so once we were 
in, we were in until we fought our way out.

You will be dealing with caster spiders, some of them healers - you can 
bash / slam them, but I don't know what your druid friend can do to prevent 
casts - never played a druid.  The healers ( Strathbone Healers, I think ) 
really suck.  From that setup room, you go through the door directly across 
the hall, and through a secret wall(?) and then down a tunnel.  You 
eventually end up outside the Library area.  One of the ghost-looking dudes 
in the library drops a decent +6(?) Int item - regularly.  We had extras of 
these and tried to give them way.  You can also get weight-reduction packs, 
although they may only be 6-slot or something.

I don't know how well either Invis works, we always fought our way down to 
the Library for the Exp.

If you go the other way from the initial spider room ( the way you go to 
leave ), you can jump down and head to the lower levels to fight.  If you 
go to the bottom, you can die at the hand of Xalgoz(?).

It's a fun zone, and hard to single pull, but with our bard charming and 
mezzing, we were able to pull it off.  Like a lot, this zone is on the same 
timer ( maybe 13 minutes, been a while ), so you can plan your pops.

Although to most they are crap drops these days, we got several neat 
weapons, etc. while we were in there.  A Wizzy dagger ( Frost? ), a ranger 
weapon, something for the bard ( drops from a spider that gates, I think ), 
maybe a monk weapon, etc.  Been a long time and I've been away from EQ, so 
my memory is fuzzy.

When you first go in and down the ramp, don't fall in the pit in front of 
you.
