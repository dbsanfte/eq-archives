Actually, I was involved in this quest on E'ci.

You were really lucky, all I got was an 8 ac neck piece with Permanent
Enduring Breath.

Then agian, to look at it on the positive side... I like to think of it as "I
was rewarded with a pretty good item, equal to the difficulty of the quest,
the Wizard just hit the jackpot."   Rahter than "Sheesh, the wizard got a good
item, and I got the shaft." ; )   and it was a pretty easy quest.

Our group completely spanked the GM elemental, well.. at least once the GM
remembered to turn off invulerable (oops)  ;)

In any event, the wizard that got completed the quest was either 52 or 54.  (I
think 52).   The GM had her activate it before he left, and she was able to
use it.

For those who don't know, Al'Kabor's Expansive Mind is a right click Clarity
2.

(tell me that wizard won't be overnuking ; P)
