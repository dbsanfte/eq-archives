We've been through this a bazillion times here. The EULA means exactly
jack and squat. The only purpose it serves is to provide a guideline
by which they will allow your continued use of *their* game servers.
Break those "rules" and they state they will cut you off. Telling you
that you can't use what's on that CD for absolutely *anything* else is
like Craftsman trying to tell you they'll sue you if you use their
screwdrivers as chisels.

I really don't see what you've got your back so up about. Nothing they
would be doing could affect you or your game experience in any
remotely conceivable way whatsoever. Seriously P, is that really you,
or are you letting someone post from your account or something (too
lazy to play IP address detective)? Someone must have really pissed in
your Post Toasties this morning. You used to be such a congenial
sort. :P
