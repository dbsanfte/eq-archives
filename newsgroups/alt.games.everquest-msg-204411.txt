"Unfortunately" they said that the item you sacrifice would be something
valuable for your level (though some items are always exempt).  So keeping
your old sword around wouldn't protect you from your current one being
snatched.  You don't get to choose what bites it. :(

They said they intend this to be the last-resort option, partially because
all priest classes will have rezzes at early levels.  Yes, that's
right...according to one interview, the shaman and druid type priests will
be rezz classes.
