Alright, as a newbie I have yet to do intercontinental travel, one
reason being I don't understand how it works other than taking the
boats. How do ports and binds work? If I'm currently based in Felwithe,
is there only a specific location that the wizard spires in Greater
Faydark can use to teleport to? If I wanted to go to Tunaria, for
example, but didn't want to take the boat, what would my options be? And
once there, can I not just have someone bind me there so that if I die I
don't have to cross over from Feydwer again? I'm really confused.
