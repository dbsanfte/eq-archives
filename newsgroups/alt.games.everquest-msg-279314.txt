There's a point. But there's more of a point to doing something else. As 
long as there is something else you have an interest in doing.

No, but if you are half a level from levelling, do you a) spend 6 hours 
doing it tonight, or b) 3 hours doing it tomorrow.

b) is more efficient. Sure you -could- get more total xp by spending 6 
hours tonight AND 3 hours tomorrow. But then, this isn't about those 
people, this is about people doing cost - benefit balancing of multiple 
tasks.

If its 6 hours today, or 6 hours tomorrow... might as well get a head 
start on it today and put it behind me. If its 6 hours today or 3 hours 
tomorrow... I might as well do something else with my 6 hours today... 
whether its a quest or watching a movie, or something else.

Its true, it does keep casual players more on the curve, but it does 
more than that.

Ah but it does eliminate the pressure to get it done all at once. If its 
going to take me 12 hours of 'grinding' to level at double XP, 3 hours 
per day over 4 days, vs 3 hours at x2, and then 18 more hours (for a 
total of 21) if I try and do it straight... sure I've got the level in 
one day instead of 3, but at nearly twice the effort.

Even if they plan to play 8 hours a day, its more efficient to rotate 
between crafting, farming, questing, and grinding than it is to grind 
for 8 hours a day straight in terms.

No minmaxxer who has more than ONE goal, will see any value to spending 
21 hours straight grinding xp. As soon as they have 2 or 3 goals (be it 
watching a movie or doing a quest, or farming some plat... they will 
realize that their time is more efficiently rewarded if they break up 
their grinding sessions. That is a *good thing*.

(And this is all fully consistent with someone who continues grinding at 
1% from the level mark... at that point they temporarily fixate and only 
have one goal. Its a psyche thing, when people have multiple large tasks 
they tend to be able to rotate them fairly well... but when one becomes 
tantalizingly close to completion they frequently fixate on it until its 
done.)

In summary, it tends to be that the only people who will mindless keep 
grinding for hours and hours after the double xp wears off are those who 
don't have any other goals (in game or out) except to get xp.
