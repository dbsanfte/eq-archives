And you do start with nothing.. and accumulate stuff from there. The
only issue here is in the allowing a person to pay a set amount of
real life money in exchange for ingame money or items. To me, that is
a legitimite way to 'accumulate stuff'. Which leaves endless hours of
farming plat to get reasonable enough gear to survive on raids and
contribute. Paying someone money for that plat i do not see as wrong,
regardless of what Sony or you has to say about the matter.

Yeah.. having your userbase quit is really in Sony's playbook. They
really don't care in anything other than official stance if this goes
on mainly because they know some people won't put up with spending a
year or two of their lives to make a reasonable character. It was a
fallacy of the original game and its been something they've been
trying to deal with in later expansions with smoothing out the xp
curve and providing xp spots to fill the gaps that the game had. They
*REALIZE* you can't take forever to be productive or your users quit
and play something else. If someone can't be up and running in 2-3
months they're gone.

Even with all the plat in the world bought.. nobody who actually plays
Everquest even tries to make the claim that the droppable shit they
buy is 'maximum tech' or is 'all that they need'. Its twink shit and
simply what they need to get better gear that can't be bought. You
seem to have this grand idea that the quest for droppable gear is an
integral part of this game. The standard rule of thumb is usually by
the time you can farm a piece of droppable gear, you don't need it,
and sell to those who do. Either for plat, cash, a trade in items or
whatever. Could you please point me to the game site that will sell me
a Blade of War? Maybe a Stone Etched War Sword? Now, if you really
want to talk about something that would be against my ethics,
something like a guild going... we'll sell the next BoW off RZTW that
drops for $2K cash, then you have a point about it interfering with
the game and its something Sony WOULD come down on hard. But atm its
not something that happens on any server and if it does feel free to
/report it.

Really, have you ever even played Everquest?  Maybe your Starquest
analogy is such because that's the game you understand. You have such
fucked up conceptions about the game that I can only come to the
conclusion that you haven't.
