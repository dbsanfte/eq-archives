Just happened to stumble into the revamped Griegs End last night. Had
a full group, 58 warrior, 58 shammy, 59 Cleric, 60 enchanter (me), 59
Wizard and a 50-something bard. Being kind of late, we didnt go very
far - just stuck around the entrance by the Dawnshroud zone.

I was really dissapointed with what I saw (albeit only a small
smattering). What I liked about this zone before was that it was on
the unique side. The ambient sounds were just creepy, and the illusion
proccing mobs made it very interesting where you couldnt tell the mobs
from the players. Also the mobs used to pop right on top of you, as if
to say.. "BOOO". It always kept you on your toes and you never knew
what to expect.

From my experience last night, all that is gone now. Its more like a
regular zone now. No "spawn traps", no ambient sounds, no illusions.
Not that we saw anyways. The XP and loot are better than before on the
other hand. I shall miss the old Griegs tho.

Does anyone here have any experiences with the revamp that has gone
further in?
