Has anyone here camped Jailor Maufan in Droga?  WHen I learned that he
drops the quest item I need for my Aged Earring of Aptitude, I went
merrily trotting down to the jail cells, only to be faced with some of the
most tightly-packed mobs I've ever seen in this zone.  The only
encouraging thing is that only 1 in 5 was a caster (very very unusual for
droga), but I have no idea if that is a fluke.  This positioning is
probably the very reason you never see him camped.

It's a situation where we *can* do this camp if our wits are sharp.  
We're very accustomed to root-splitting camps by now.  What I fear, alas,
is that these mobs are so tightly-packed that I may be seeing my
first-ever 3-pull in droga.  So again...has anyone done this camp, and do
you know if 1) you ever get 3-pulls, 2) is the short hall leading down
into the first room of the jail cells the best place to stand, or is there
a not-so-obvious safe spot, 3) is it easier than it looks, and 4) are
there by any chance fewer casting mobs here than other places?  (My normal
spots are Seer camp or Japal, so I'm used to at least 50% casters, if not
more.  Rooting casters is just...not very effective. :P)
