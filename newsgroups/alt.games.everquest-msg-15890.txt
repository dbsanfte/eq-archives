	I haven't heard any successes with sneak recently, but that doesn't
mean that sneak doesn't work. We've blown up one with sneak when it was
definately doable by indiff faction.

	A common problem is that the sneaker gets too close to Harla when
turning in the talisman, but if she's harmonied (and she oughta be), she
won't attack even though you're too close for sneak to work.

	When turning in the Frakedar talisman, do it when she's stopped,
with /no/ other MOBs around, while she's harmonied, you're sneaking, and
from max trade distance.

	The faction change may have prevented sneak from allowing you to
complete the quest, but I haven't heard enough one way or the other to know
for sure.
