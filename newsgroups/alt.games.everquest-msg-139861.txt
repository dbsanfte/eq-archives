I have no tolerance for beggars.. most the time I just ignore them, but on
occasion that they are extremely annoying and bugging me, I have no
hesitation in telling them to fuck off, or stfu

Before the bazaar launched, i regularly used to clear my bank out, which
involved getting all the gear I was too lazy to sell (basically all loot I
had obtained), and giving it to people (naked people) in noob zones/cities,
who did NOT ask me for something

I don't care how polite you are, don't fuckin beg from me cuz you will never
get shit!
