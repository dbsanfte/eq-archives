I don't know if that's true.  Our little guild is not into Ssraeshza yet.
To get remove greater curse we would have to either kill a couple L63 mobs
in Ssraeshza till it drops, or farm components at the entry to CT off mobs
<L57.  Besides the level difference, I understand that mobs in Ssraeshza
cast curse so it would be nice to have the spell going in.
