Sorry, I didn't make that clear enough....

I didn't mean that the US played no role in the sanctions. I meant
that the sanctions were the only steps the UN is willing to take to
address the issue. The US's guilt in the issue is based on the fact
that we have let the UN take the lead, and not taken care of the
problem directly (or "unilaterally" as all the Euro's scream). The US
tries to play the "good guys", and keep everyone happy. The world just
doens't work that way.

At some point the US will have had enough, and will tell the UN to
piss-off. Most likely as soon as weather conditions over Iraq are
favorable for military operations (most likely close to the begining
of Feb). I also expect most of the hold-out nations to come over and
support the ousting of SH by then.
