Reinforced all the way.  STA = more HP.  More HP = longer grace period for 
the tank to peel the mob off you after that hellacious backstab you just 
did.  More AC = mobs hit for less, extending that grace period even more.

Also, more STR = higher backstabs.  Only downside is that with lower DEX 
you'll learn melee skills a little slower.  AFAIK the only thing that 
affects whether your BS lands or not is your BS skill.  I'm sure someone 
can correct me on this.

As most people can tell you, STA is one of the most difficult stats to 
raise with gear while maintaining your other stats.  To pass up 10 STR and 
10 STA on one piece of gear for a rogue is insane :P  DEX is fairly easy to 
raise.
