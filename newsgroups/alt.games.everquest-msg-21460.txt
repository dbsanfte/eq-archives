If that's the only two choices I'd go with the latter.

It could also be bad luck.  Friends of mine told me that to get money I just
HAD to kill furbies (sea fury cyclopses) and that they earned more than 30p
an hour.  So I went there one night and got 1/4 of that.  I went the next
night and got even less.  They went the following night and got their usual
amount.
