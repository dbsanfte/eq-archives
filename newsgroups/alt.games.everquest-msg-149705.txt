Yup, that's what happens for me, too.  I've found the easiest way around 
it is to click the link then type the text around it.  Kind of a pain in 
the ass, especially since you cannot get to the end of the text if it 
scrolls off the text bar.

Once in awhile though, I just cannot link to something, no matter how 
many combinations I try, or how many times I try closing an re-opening 
the inspect window.
