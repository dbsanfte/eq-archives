I have seen some machines have degrading framerate problems and others 
not.  I suspect the difference is in the video card or driver.  I 
haven't noticed it at character select recently, but I did a long time 
ago.  Since then I try not to stay at character select too long :)  With 
one machine using a GeForce2 things get gradually slower until the 
machine is unusable.  Zoning seems to make it worse, usually, though 
occasionally it improves things.

One thing that helps me is switching screens.  I used to have to log out 
and back in again to fix the problem, but now Alt-Enter twice makes life 
bearable again when things get slow.
