Fortunately this so is completely OUTLANDISH that this will most likely
never come to a head.  All points listed are completely generic and vague,
smacking of typical legal crackpot rhetoric.
Comparing it to the tobacco industry?  The tobacco industry supposedly
covered up information about the dangers of their products.  I don't think
Sony would be involved in this type of stupid behavior.
Someone's child died.  That is indeed sad.  It takes more than a video game,
alcohol, drugs, bad romances, etc. to generally push someone over the edge.
It's generally a culmination of many factors over a long period of time.

This poor slob had a problem probably long before EQ was even in development
I'm sure.  They are also not taking into consideration that young males are
the most apt (statistically proven) to commit suicide.

If you really must kill yourself over EQ, can I have your stuff?
