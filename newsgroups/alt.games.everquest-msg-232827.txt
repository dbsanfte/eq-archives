Is there an existing document that defines all the different types of 
aggro?  Otherwise, will people add to this thread their understanding of 
it?

Here's where my confusion comes from:

Estate of Unrest:  I'm a 33 cleric, group with a 31 pally buddy.  Have my 
52 druid on a 2nd box to tag along.  All get wolf form.  Mobs con 
indifferent to me (cleric) but KOS to pally.  We're both human and 
Mithanril Marr worshippers.  Green mobs leave him alone unless we've pissed 
off higher mobs and then they join the fight - I can understand this.  
Strength in numbers.  But why is he KOS and I'm not?

SOL A:  Same group.  This time we're all KOS - no biggy.  But now the 
greens aggro even though it's a death sentence.  Why?  If they get away 
from you, you can have 10 green buddies on your ass.  That part I 
understand, but why does a single green aggro?

My next thread will be on SOL A strategies.  ;-)
