Verant defines killstealing strictly in terms of who engages first.
Some players (bizbee would be a vocal example) figure if you're not
engaging the mob they have the right to do so (Verant would appear to
agree).  Other players seem to think of EQ as analogous to a 19th
century goldrush, where you stake your claim on a first come first
served basis and they will become exceedingly irate if you violate
the local "camping" custom (which Verant will not enforce).

Note that camping customs vary from zone to zone and server to server,
and not all players or guilds on a particular server will abide by any
particular set of these customs, so there are a lot of opportunites for
misunderstanding and self-righteous posturing.

Good luck navigating the swamp, it's a lot like RL politics,
