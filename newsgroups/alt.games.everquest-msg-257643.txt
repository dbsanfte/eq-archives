Didn't try the FRC, but as far as alt-tabbing goes, the alt-enter and 
shift-alt-r that worked for me before now leaves EQ in a state that will 
not revert back to full screen afterward. It tries to for about 1 second 
then changes back. I have to actually log and manually change the 
UseWindowedMode (I think that's what it's called) setting back to FALSE 
in the EQClient.ini file. Until I do that, I'm stuck in windowed mode.

Honestly, I'm a programmer myself, and I gotta ask - how hard can it 
freaking be? Bah, spare me the in-depth analyses. It was a rhetorical 
question. Bottom line is, if it is this difficult to get the changes 
right, then perhaps they should leave it alone. For me it's worse now 
than it was before.
