    Like the other tradeskills, there will now be a Grandmaster Alchemist's
trophy.

    During his encounter, adds appear in a specific place. So people who
couldn't deal with that would warp him somewhere else, where the adds

Test, a lot of the silly exploits guilds used to get him dead are now
removed.
