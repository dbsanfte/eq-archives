I think most people would agree that the new bazaar is a really cool
feature.  However, most have also shown frustration with the sheer
number of people in the zone.  Performance sucks as a result.

The problem is obvious:  Too much for video card to render in a timely
manner.  However, the problem existed before July 24:  The zone
*already* suffered in performance.  So the question is, why did Verant
decide to design the bazaar in the manner they did?

I don't know what motivation they had.  However, what are the
alternate designs available that could have prevented this problem? 
Off the top of my head:


(1) Expand the zone size

Instead of packing everything into a small area, there could be vendor
"districts".  When doing a search for a particular item, the district
of the vendor would be listed along with the item.

By spreading PC's evenly across a large space, the clipping plane can
remain maxed and the video card won't buckle.  Well, *some* video
cards won't buckle =)

Possible problem: PC's will still probably congregate at the entrance
while doing their searches.


(2) More entry points

Since the majority of the lag comes from zone entry, where people are
immediately opening up the search feature, I would suspect that making
more entry points into the bazaar would help.

However, it would seem kind of silly to have 5 entrances from the
nexus into the bazaar.  So how about a teleport system, like what you
see in Erudin?  You could see multiple "steppable" gems that port you
into different parts of the bazaar.

Problem: How would you implement multiple entry points without making
things look silly?  Tough call...


(3) Offline selling

Enable sellers to make their wares available when offline.  This will
prevent the people from camping a mule in a trader stall.  The closest
analogy I can think of would be the classifieds in the newspaper.

The solution would involve a player making an item available for sale.
 The player would have to give up the item while it is up for sale
(possibly getting a token of some sort in exchange, to prevent having
infinite bank space).  hehe, I could see it now, you're out fighting
some dragon with your uber gear that you forgot was up for sale, and
someone purchases it... *poof*

Possible problem: Under the hood of the EQ engine, this would probably
be a major undertaking with the code.  I am guessing Verant would rule
this cost prohibitive to their bottom line; after all, they are
running a business.


Any other design possibilities?  I am somewhat baffled at Verant's
decision to implement the bazaar in the fashion they did.  It was so
obvious that it would create performance issues.

By the way, here's a tongue-in-cheek kudos to Verant on moving the
entire economy to Luclin: more revenue from people wanting to
participate in the economy and needing to purchase Luclin!
