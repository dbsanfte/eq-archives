Grats!  I mean that.  Newbie armor quests can be fun and I wish there
were more quests out there that resulted in good equipment for the
associated level.  I was just as excited when I quested for most of my
Lambent Armor pieces.  My proudest moment was when I quested for my
Nostrolo's Tambourine.

Does anyone know of any quests out there that a level 42 bard can do
that results in a good armor item, or a good ring, or a decent weapon?
