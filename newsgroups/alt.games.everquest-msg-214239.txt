The case I'm thinking of is where your dungeon group doesn't have a Cleric,
and you wipe out, and you decide for some reason you'd rather not continue,
but would just like to get an outside Cleric to come by and res you.  Is
there a way to get the corpses out of the dungeon for that, or do you have
to wait?

If you have to wait, and you wiped early, and it is a 90 minute adventure
with 30 more minutes until the dungeon goes away, that would leave only an
hour on the res timer after the corpse becomes available to an outside
Cleric.  That could be annoying if you are playing during a time when it
takes a while to find an available Cleric.

On the other hand, perhaps there will simply be Clerics hanging out in the
zones that have LDoN dungeon entrances, waiting to sell reses when instances
go away.
