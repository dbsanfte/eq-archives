Upsets you who have told me what a bad cleric I am to see anything that 
suggests proof you are wrong?

You all act like school yard bullies who think you are Kings of the 
playground! A new person posts a couple threads... and you're out to put her 
in her place? Sorry, boys. This one doesn't run with her tail between her 
legs.

Asking how others felt about a bad situation I was in was not a license to 
tell me I am stupid for not knowing the capabilities of every class, telling 
me I suck as a cleric, and that clerics as a whole are useless. Perhaps you 
think so, but fortunately, the vast majority of folks on EQ beg for healers 
to come join their group. So whether it be envy of our class, or just 
wanting to be mean... we all know the truth is... clerics are extremely 
sought after. Why that upsets some of you, is beyond me.
