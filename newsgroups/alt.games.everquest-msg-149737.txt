Ahh - that's actually quite fun to do going back top old characters, I did
that on the weekend with an 30 shaman. I was thunderstruck by how poverty
stricken I was back then, he was still in banded armour, bandit rings and
weilding a velium spear : O

Anyway - I spent the weekend twinking him "slightly", ie, Ikky Breastplate,
Bracer of Quickness, Bracer of Sense, Engraved Velium Arms,  Shissar scaled
gloves and Headband, GEB's, Seild of Bane Warding and a neato 12/19 shaman
only peircer, you know - just the basics : )

One thing I did note - getting 200 wis was quite a challenge on a Barb
Shammy compared to 200 int on a Necro or Mage. I may actually bump into Jazz
and co as well as they are on Xev. Chimp got sent back to Tunare *pouts* so
I have to pay 50 bucks to drag his boney ass accross though, thankfully I
gave his gear to one of the Stormhammer Native characters so not much will
be lost, just the no-drops.
