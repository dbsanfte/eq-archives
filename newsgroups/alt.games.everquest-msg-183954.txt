I didnt mess around with my graphics card last night (19.00hrs GMT) UK. But
i get the same message. I can run patcher, even connect, but after server
select screen, 12 seconds, black screen, blue bar at top, 2 seconds
later.....

EQgame has caused an error at EQGFX.DX8.dll

Have done eversince last night, when game crashed to desktop, approx 15 mins
beofre the pre-warned server shutdown..

Ive tried everything on FAQ even uninstalling graphic card etc etc. Only
thing I havent tried is uninstalling EQ, but thats my last resort.

Must be something their end???

Though Im sure they will blame my card.

Oh well, thats life.
