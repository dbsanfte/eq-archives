Sony with all liklihood has ip logs, (the ip used when the account was 
hacked, and possibly other characters who have been logged in with the 
same ip ... his 'real' characters, a link to his real identiy. A lot of 
'hackers' aren't that bright!!) and time played logs, and even logs as 
to who he interacted with, who was the likely recipient of any 
items/cash that were stripped from the account, etc; these could be used 
as a stepping stone to identifying the hacker and associates.

I can still see SOE doing it as a PR move, to prevent SOE and Everquest 
in particular showing up in a legal dispute, even as an relatively 
uninvolved 3rd party. The media could still use it as an opportunity to 
dredge up other EQ 'related' tragedies...

And even if it wasn't PR, per se. If SOE admits the account has been 
hacked, and its not as a result of the player disclosing the password, 
then its 'just good customer service' to make good on the damage to the 
account. ...Though it may take a lawsuit to wake them up that you are 
serious.
