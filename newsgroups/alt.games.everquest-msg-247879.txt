I'm actually running into spots now where fear kiting isn't feasible.
Obviously dungeons (or any indoor zone, for that matter) are out, but a lot
of the outdoor zones I'm moving have mobs that are simply too high to fear
kite.  It's part of the reason I was considering duo-boxing.

Oh well - I guess I'll be DoTing it out until I get my Wake the Dead AA
ability. :)
