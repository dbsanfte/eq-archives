Thanks for the info. I've hung out in Karnor's a bit, but haven't
gotten a group yet. I think I just haven't given it enough patience,
though.

I do belong to a guild and we have events every one to three weeks,
but there just aren't enough of us on of the right levels when I play
to have a reliable source of groups.

What are these good places that require keys and where do I get them?
I do belong to a guild and could get assistance acquiring them.

Three zoner? Maybe, but I've never hunted in LoIO. The main road for
my Warrior has been Oasis, Highpas, HHK, OT, DL. Lots of diversions in
between, but that's the meat of it.

I've heard a lot of badmouthing of pick up groups in the above areas
but I must admit that my experiences have been mostly good ones. Good
groups with good people. Oh, sure, there is the occasional jerk or bad
mix of classes. Ninja looting seems to be the biggest problem, but
even that is uncommon.

I also like to think of myself as one of the "good ones" when I read
those articles. I play my 49 human Warrior and have brought up a 43
dwarf Cleric and I think I play them both very well.

Another question: I'm currently bringing up an erudite Enchanter. I've
dont 11-14 in Crushbone, and it's been the most fun I've had playing
EQ in a long time. I'm gonna have to rely on pick up groups for him as
well, but would like to avoid the places I've already been (basically
the stuff I've listed above - my Cleric mixed it up a bit, but found
himself getting a lot of his xp in the same old places). Any advice on
reliable pick up groups for him?

Thanks,

b.
