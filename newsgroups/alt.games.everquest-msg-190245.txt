I'd agree with you on items costing less than 10k in the  bazaar.
However, the big ticket items (those costing more than 10k) have
increased.  A little over a month ago Yantis was selling 100k for
around  $500,   It didn't look like he was selling very much at that
price & he didn't have very much.   Now he's selling 100k for less
than $250 & it's flying out the door.   He suddenly has millions of pp
on every server at super low prices.  ???
