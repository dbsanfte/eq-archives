If you want to be technical, you should not end a sentence with a
prepositional phrase either.  In that vein it should also be noted that
there is a bit of irony inherent in the phrase 'my bad'.

I think the most compelling argument for not using it is the fact that it is
relatively modern slang, and not appropriate in a 'role playing' sense.
Perhaps you should use more dated slang, i.e. gag me with a pike.
