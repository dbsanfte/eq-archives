(numbers COMPLETELY fictitious for illustration purposes)

Say you kill a blue in 1 minute, and take 2 minutes healing and medding
before you're ready for the next mob.

1: If you can kill it in 1 minute, it'll do 1 minute's damage to you. If
two of you kill it, it'll take 30 seconds, so only do 30 seconds worth
of damage. 

2: If it took you 2 minutes to fully recover from the damage done and
mana expended, it'll now take 1 minute to recover the mana from half the
damage, and since it's across 2 people, that's 30 seconds each.

Therefore:
Solo, you can kill 20 mobs per hour for all the exp
Add another person, same as you, and you can kill 60 mobs per hour for
half the exp = 30 mobs worth of exp.

Add to that, others in the group from different classes have different
skills, better than you in some areas, worse than you in others.

Add to that there is a (small) experience bonus, the more people in your
group

Add to that, you get to meet people

Add to that, you will be developing skills in grouping which you'll NEED
at higher levels since you won't be soloing blues with ease throughout
your life

Hope that has filled in a few parts of the equation for you
