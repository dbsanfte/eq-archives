- Damage shield is unresistable damage and increases fire resist.
- Potent fire and magic based direct and rain damage.
- Magic, fire, cold, poison(?), disease(?) resist debuffs (i.e. Malise
series).
- Summoned focus effect items (inventory slot) - improved spell damage
(arm?), mana conservation on direct damage spells (ear), improved buff
duration (shoulders or back), decreased casting time on non damage spells
(finger).
- Pet - Mage pets probably have the best melee capability (not 100% sure).
Air pet stuns are great in a group setting.  At level 54+, the water pet
backstabs for damage up to the 165hp range.  Pre-50, the fire pet has a
strong fire shield, although it will be unusual for the pet to take hits in
a group setting since a PC tank will almost always hold aggro.

Not sure what the "invis" refers to in reference to a magician moreso than a
wizard, druid, etc.
