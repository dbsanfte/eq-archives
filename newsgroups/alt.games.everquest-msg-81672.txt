I know people have their own theories about that.  But the reason I said
what I did is that once I read a message from the person who actually
codes the trade skill portions of Everquest.  The message said that
successes and skill improvements are both based on the higher of your
WIS or INT, with a small secondary bonus from another attribute, which
depends on the particular trade skill.  The message specifically said
that the secondary attribute for Jewelry is Charisma.  The secondary
attribute for other trade skills was not revealed.

Of course, I can't find the message now, so my advice is no better
than anyone else's.  If I can dig it up I'll post it.
