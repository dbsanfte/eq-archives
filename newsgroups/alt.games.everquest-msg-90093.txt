Greetings All,

I would like to know your opinions on this. I play a 52 druid and I love the
class. I have never commented before about any of the druid abilities,
although I have chimed in from time to time when the Druid bashing was
rampant.

It seems to me that druids have had their utility vastly reduced, relative
to other classes, since the inclusion of Luclin. Most classes have gained
significantly from the new Luclin weapons and armor, and the mobility
offered by the Nexus portals.

My biggest complaint lies with the inability to port, single or group,
around Luclin. While many melee types may retort "welcome to my world", I
think this is a severe blow to druids since the ability to port is the
discriminating characteristic of the class. Imagine 30 zones where Monks
couldn't FD, or clerics couldn't heal/rez, or had MOBs 100% immune to melee
damage. Add to this that many MOBs in Luclin are immune to snare/root, the
druid is even less useful.

The worst of this is that it weakens the druids already poor position when
grouping at higher levels. My biggest contribution to most raids is getting
tanks and clerics to the fight. I have read several times that all druids
are good for at higher levels is DS/Evac and secondary healing. Well, who
wants to EVAC out of Luclin when it takes 30 minutes just to get the group
back - its faster to die and rez.

The druids usefulness in groups has even been further assaulted by the
ability for all classes to port throughout Norrath via the Nexus portals.

I understand Verants desire to promote grouping, and druids tend to solo. I
prefer grouping, but I find my contribution to groups is much less now since
Luclin. Of course I can still solo/quad/etc. through all of the old world -
and I still excel at PL'ing people's alts, but I would much more enjoy being
a useful contributor to groups.

Don't want to sound whiney here, just interested in peoples thoughts on the
subject.
