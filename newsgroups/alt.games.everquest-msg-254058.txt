I'd recommend a more middle ground: don't spend training points
at low levels, since your early skills tend to go up pretty well
on their own just from normal use.  (Exceptions being any skills
that you have to "unlock" by spending 1 point, as you noted.)

But later on, like in your teens and 20s, you may get some skills
that would be really useful if only they worked more reliably.
And when you spend the 1 point to unlock those skills, you'll get
them at your current level, even though it's well below the skill
cap for that level.  (E.g., monks at level 17 can spend 1 point to
learn the Mend skill.  The 1 point gives it to them at skill 17,
but the level cap is 90.)  I've found it useful to save up my
training points so that I can get a head start pushing up some of
those later skills.

I've never played a Paladin, so I don't know what specific skills
it might make sense for a paladin to save up training points for.

In any case, I would certainly second the recommendation that you
NOT spending training points on skills that (a) are close to your
level cap (usually 5 x (level+1)) and (b) tend to go up on their
own through use.  If nothing else, wait a bit and see if the skill
is falling behind.  If you spend points to push the skill all the
way to your level cap, it guarantees that you'll never get any
skill-ups through using the skill, and that's a waste.
