That would be easy: if you put them in as two stacks of 9, it would try to
make bandages.  If you put them in as three stacks of 6, it would try to
make cords.

I'd keep it so that COMBINE only tries to make one item, so that you don't
run into any problems if you put in three stacks of different sizes with
making some cords and some bandages.  I'd also make it so shift-COMBINE does
try to do as many COMBINEs as it can, for those who know what they are
doing.

For items that require a pattern, I'd make it so patterns are charged items,
and activating the pattern when you have the appropriate, empty, trade
container (or are at a public one) automatically takes the appropriate items
from your inventory, and tries to combine them.

For items that do not require a pattern, I'd make it so that the description
in the appropriate book (e.g., the recipie in a cookbook) is clickable.
Clicking would cause the appropriate items to be taken from your inventory
and combined in the appropriate container.

Finally, I'd add a new command:

    /combine skill item1 item2 ...

"Skill" is the name of a tradeskill, such as "baking", "tailoring", etc.
ItemN is the name of an item, in link format.  This command takes the
specified items if you have them, and tries to combine them using the
specified skill, in your appropriate empty container.

Presumably, you would hotkey /combine commands for the things you are
interested in making more than a couple of times.

If the time it takes to futz around moving things from inventory to the
container is meant to put a cap on how fast people can do tradeskills (in
addition to the cap put on by needing to acquire ingrediants, I'd have the
/combine command have a recycle time).
