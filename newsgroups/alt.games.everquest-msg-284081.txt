So I'm sticking with my little gnome SK on Combine, and finally passed 
the mark achieved in a few days play on "real" servers by my sample (got 
him to 24 before Combine opened).

I'm woefully undergeared, though, and I suspect that isn't merely versus 
regular servers, but versus where I "should" be on Combine as well.

I was grouped at 6 or 7 in Steamfont at the windmills area when a 
minotaur stolled by partially injured.  I assisted him, nothing, which 
told me that his former target had died or zoned or... well highly 
unlikely because of the low level of everyone on the server at that 
point, but mem blurred, FD'd, or Atoned him.  Anyway, free game.  So I 
pulled him, and we took him down; he dropped a mino axe.

I've been using that for 20 levels now, until very recently.

Perhaps I'm doing the math wrong, but it seems to me everything I've 
looted has had an inferior ratio to it:

Minotaur Battle Axe: 8/37 = .216

Fine Steel: (each weapon is better  than its rusty, tarnished, or bronze 
version)

Dagger 3/19 = .158
Greatstaff 9/36 = .250
Longsword 6/28 = .214
Rapier 5/23 = .217
Scimitar 4/23 = .174
Spear 6/27 = .222
Two Handed Sword 12/43 =  = .279
Warhammer 6/30 = .200
Morning Star 8/38 = .211

Other than that
Dagger of Dropping 4/22 procs weakness = .182
Giant Snake Fang I forget, something like 5/26 = .192
  is about all I've seen drop.

Now although I know better, I've also neglected all my weapon skills, 
since by far the best weapon I had was the mino axe, I just used that 
constantly, so my other skills have suffered.  It looks, at this point, 
though, as though I can remedy that; there's a piercer, the FS Spear, 
thats a better ratio, and a 2hb, the FS Great Staff, thats better still, 
and the FS Two Handed Sword thats best of all.  Good reason to raise 
each category.

Why, besides sheer laziness, have I neglected those skills?  Well, its a 
catch 22; I'm trying to get the job done, and that means aggro, and 
aggro means hitting the target and doing some damage, although to be 
honest it probably more means casting annoying spells and mashing Taunt 
a lot.  So at first, I didn't give up the axe because swapping that out 
for a tarnished somethign or other and doing a lot less damage didn't 
make much sense, and later, swapping out any 1hs for anything else meant 
I'd hardly hit at all due to low skill, which wasn't going to help keep 
aggro either.

Solo, well, same story different verse, now its not a question of aggro, 
but it is a question of doing enough damage to kill the mob before my 
mana runs out.

However, I do have a plan; I'll find a mob to solo which is invulnerable 
to regular weapons, fight it till its running in place from being snared 
and wounded, then swap in the weapon of my choice and swing away till 
the cows come home.  With luck, the comparatively small damage from my 
snare DOT will just keep up with its natural regen.  Only flaws in this 
plan are that I'll have to actually hurt the mob enough to get it 
running, and that I'll have to keep mana up for keeping that 
irritatingly short duration snare on it.

Since I haven't played a melee much, and a MT even less than that, 
perhaps there's something missing in my analysis, any help would be 
appreciated.

Other than that, well I'm saving up to buy a BALS or maybe a BABS.
