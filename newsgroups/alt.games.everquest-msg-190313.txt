When I first made it to 15 with my bard (about 1 month or so after
release), Lullabye was extrodinarily overpowered.  Got an over pull
of gnolls down in the High shaman's room in split paw, and managed
to lock down 3 of them with it, while barely taking a hit.  With my
new full set of banded (man was I proud :) I could take it easily.

Then, in response to that, they added a secondary resist that had
the result you described.  Bard named John Kim did extensive parses
showing how F'd up the resists were - we got assured it was working
"as intended" and most of us gave up on the song.  I'm glad to hear
they made it single target, creating a line of single target mezzes
with Pixie strike and Song of Twilight.
