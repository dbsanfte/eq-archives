Don't know if you are referring to building up "blue" (double?)
experience while off-line.  If you are, you are right, it's a great
feature.  It has lots of nice effects.  It discourages sitting in one
spot and grinding.  It encourages playing of more than one character.
It also gets people to put somewhat sensible limits on their playtime.
Nowadays I rarely play a character when I'm out of blue experience.  

So yes, as a long time EQ player, WoW has a lot of improvements, and
blue experience is one of them.
