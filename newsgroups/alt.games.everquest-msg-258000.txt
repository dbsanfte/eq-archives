I haven't played EQ for a while, but I recently bought two 17" LG 
Flatron L1710B, and I'm ridiculously pleased with them. While primarily 
I bought them for use with the Mac, they seem to handle games on the PC 
just fine (although with the framerates I get with Doom 3, a guy oil-
painting the screen by hand would probably be able to keep up).

Bear in mind that all LCD monitors have a "permitted" amount of bad 
pixels that, below that, won't allow you to return it. I don't think 
I've got any bad pixels on either of mine, but if you got, say, a bright 
red stuck pixel near the middle of the display can be a pain in the arse, 
particularly in games played first-person. It's a bit of a lottery...
