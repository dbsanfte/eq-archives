It mostly involves movement as he states.

If you are offering the coins FIRST, they can simply strafe and the
coins will fall to the ground. There is a "Drop confirmation ON" for
items so you can't drop them but there is no such confirmation for
money. 

This is why you always wait for the item to be in the trade window
before putting in the money. If you are the seller you always put the
item on them first also before offering money.

Another thing often forgotten is ALWAYS make sure the name you see in
the trade window is their name. I had some guy giving something to his
friend once give me a ghoulbane instead and click "ok". Then I watched
for a second while they both stood there. I Planned to wait until they
started freaking out, but I'm too nice and just gave it back to the
guy and said "be more careful."

The backpack etc scam is one that people often try because even with
drop confirmation on if the thing has no room to go back in your inven
when they cancel, it drops to ground and they pick it up. So no, you
DON'T have to hit okay. This is also why you never put more than one
item in trade window, even if I'm selling 3 things to one guy I sell
them all one at a time. If they act like that is funny, just explain
why you are and say they always should also. They fixed the wurmslayer
but some other items still won't fit in regular containers. For
example, Marrs Promise is one which will only fit in open inven slot
or a container which can carry GIANT like a sewing kit.

That is something else I always do, I always have one invent slot
fully open, then one deluxe or large sewing kit mostly open. That way
even if you forget the thing will fall into the large or deluxe sewing
kit. There again though it won't if its another container.

Container tricks are probably the mose prevelent scam.
