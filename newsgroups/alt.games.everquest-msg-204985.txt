If that happens, I found the best solution to be this if you plan on using
them frequently - after a server pop (i.e. servers have just come back up
after a patch), go to BB and make sure the translocators aren't up.
Petition that you need the translocators because the shuttles to Timorous
Deep aren't working.  If you can log out so that by the time a guide or GM
gets your petition he/she can't contact you and try and tell you to make due
with the way things are, all the better.  The translocators do not
automatically spawn - you have to petition for them.
