Not gonna comment on that last  ;)  But...
Slam is a special form of Bash, available as a racial ability to
some large race PCs and many NPCs (including some small ones).
Slam uses Bash skill, so if you have Slam as a racial ability on
a character of a class that does not have Bash (or is too low to
learn Bash) you will Slam with a skill of 0.  Not only does Slam
use Bash skill, but there is a bug with Slamming magic-to-hit mobs
(like willowisps):  to Bash a magic-to-hit mob you need a shield
that is tagged magic equipped, to Slam such a mob you need a
shoulder slot armor piece that is tagged magic, but if you have a
magic shoulder equipped and a non-magic shield equipped you cannot
Slam a magic-to-hit mob.  So, all Slams are actually Bashes, but
they use slightly different rules than Bashing with a shield.
