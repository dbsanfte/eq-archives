nope i never said you were a jerk... just said you had a knack of
going for the heart with your rapier wit.   and to just brush that
part aside, your not all bad.  
I think they took my meaning, and ran with it. 

Please note  DT is not a JERK, hes just a little flamboyant and hot
headed when he disagrees with someone, thing, or idea.
He does on occasions have informative posts. 

that better so they dont think your a jerk?
