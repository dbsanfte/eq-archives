Again, I don't know it for a fact.  But I do know the faction
database gets screwy sometimes.  We've heard about the guy
who worked giant faction up 2 separate times because all of
his factions got reset...and as a troll getting faction back up
in  Freeport, Cabilis, and Kael had him sorta pissed off.

I would hope this isn't the case, though, during a server-split.
Just throwing it out as a possibility.
