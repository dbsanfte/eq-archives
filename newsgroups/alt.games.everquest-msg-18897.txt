Nope,  they can change or remove surnames under certain circumstances but
not first ones, unless it breaks the naming policy (then they change it for
you and you have no choice)

I know this, I have tried.
I made Bard to test a Blade of Fiery Lamentation and used an equally stupid
name as I'd seen on other bards, Jonnbon (Axl had been done already).
Ages later I start playing the character in view of making him a mule (he's
now 22nd so hardly just a mule) but wanted to change the name and was then
informed that it couldn't be done.
My surname? Well I had no intention of making 20th to start with but it
happened so I had to choose the obvious (the idea being to hit /played and
see how much game time it took to lose it again) I even had people telling
me to get to twenty just so I could take the name Jovi (or a misspelling of)
Well it never happened as a GM had spotted the name (prolly the one I
petitioned to have my first name changed) and blocked my entering of a
Surname (any Surname) so I had to petition for one (lol, nice one)
What makes me laugh about all this is the amount of people that think my
name is "cool" riiight, personally I think it's lame and wish I'd remade the
character before deciding I'd like to try a bard but it's too late now.
Still I see much worse everyday.

So basically, like me, You are stuck with it :�)

CF
Funnily enough the name generator can and has, created that name, same
spelling, for Pets. One of my guild has screen shots of a pet called Jonnbon
giving the usual pet responses "Jonnbon says: Guarding with my life, master"
Git :�)
