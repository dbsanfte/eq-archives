I think your named twoheads for good reason.  your stuck on the idea of
extra appendages, while i don't quite follow how this applies to allowing
spell casters the ability to cast more spells.  AD&D allowed more than 8
spells mem'ed.  Gemstone 3 allows more than 8 spells mem'ed, and also uses
mana in their system.  Countless other games aren't stuck in this old client
model that I believe needs to be updated.

Didn't they just add another attack for certain melee classes?  triple
attack instead of double now?

I guess this falls under the category what have yo done for me lately.  They
are looking for things to improve on spell casters after working on melees,
and this is something that should be considered.
