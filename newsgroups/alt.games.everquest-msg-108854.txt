While Hitler's particular insanity might sort of fit your assertion,
his concept of "the greater good" was exceedingly narrow and hardly
in keeping with the usual meaning attached to that concept.  As for
Stalin, I've never seen the least shred of evidence that he ever did
anything except out of sheer self-interest, which is not in any way
congruent with "the greater good".
