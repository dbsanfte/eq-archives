I'm pretty sure that yes, I was positioning correctly. ...or at least
I wasn't doing anything differently those times I'd loose agro. Maybe
it was just a matter of luck, procs and a small data sample but I
think the difference was too dramatic for that. 

Wish I knew a good, high-end warrior on Bristlebane and I'd do some
testing in a group but I pretty much tend to group with SKs or a
Paladin as the MT in my exp groups. Not because I avoid warriors but
because those are the classes that my friends play.
