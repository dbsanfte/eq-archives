Tell me about it. I've been unemployed before, but this is ridiculous.
Never more than a month before. Add to that the fact that this time
I've got other people who are suffering by my being unemployed (Fiance
got laid off a month after I got out here, and neither of us have
found work), and it's a headache and a half. I'm beating my head
against the wall wondering what, when I could barely provide for my
self financially, possessed me to think I could support another adult
and a child....

Not sure if the prospects would be any more likely than everything
else I've been pursuing. I'll do some searching and see what I can
find there, though. Sucks night shifts, though. I got gaming 1 night
during the week and Saturday nights. Gotta make sacrifices to pay
rent, though. :-/
