I love Nadox, one of the funnest pickup groups hubby and I found 
was in the non-lava guthank zone corner. We were camping that 
room with the statue in the middle for about 3 hours. Good xp, 
and we all got decent loots. We were pulling most of the 
Blackguards to that spot and everybody went away happy=) Also 
done the luggalds and undeads a fair amount. ALtogether FUN zone=)

I will go and solo the entrance room sometimes=)

Torgiran mines can be pretty fun also=)
