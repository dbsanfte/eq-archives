}Have any of you done any of these quests as a non-shammy?

Yes.  I just recently destroyed the stupid gem thingy you get from the 
spirit in North Freeport.  And I'm a gnome enchanter.  As I recall, I did 
need collaboration and an ilusion to get the lesser spirit to talk to me.  
You might try wolf form, or having a friendly chanter charm it.

}Assuming it can be done, do you still get Truespirit faction hits off of
}completing them?

At the very least, you get Truespirit faction for handing the gem to Bondl 
in NFP.

}Any other quests jump to mind that give positive Truespirit hits?

Only shows up in the epic quests... Dunno which besides Shaman and Wizzie.  
Definitely not Druid or Ranger, I don't think.  It's amazing how few of 
these epic walkthroughs bother to mention faction hits.  Sigh.
