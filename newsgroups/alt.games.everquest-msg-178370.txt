Your problem seems to be the way your video card drivers are handling
DirectX.

First, make sure you are using the latest drivers for your video card. I
believer the latest is version 13.93.65. That in itself can be a problem.
Right now, the site to get the drivers is down, and you have to log in to
get them (username/password is archive/archive).

Second, get the latest DirectX drivers, currently version 9. You can get
this from http://www.microsoft.com/directx.

Good luck.
