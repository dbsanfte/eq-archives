Maybe that was the idea, but its screwed right up. My eru sk alt has now 
  gained several levels camping calcified bones, killing nothing but 
calcified skeletons, greater skeletons (and their ph skeletons, and 
halfling skeletons, zombies, and lessr mummies) at the 3 spawn camp by 
the wiz spires.

After spending 5 hours in toxx forest and killing a whopping 6 skeletons 
I headed to Nek woods where there were a couple skell camps, and have 
been there for several levels now, and the skeletons are all now green, 
and the only conning mob is the lesser mummies, and the odd zombie ph.

I even pulled my druid in to track the wanderers. I'm at 30 hours each 
with 2 characters... one at the wiz spire 3-spawn, and the druid 
handling the undead tower in the south, and all the southern wanderers.

I now have over 2,000 bone chips, and I am still missing a calcified 
sternum. My SK went from having the greater skells be yellow to green 
killing nothing but the one 3 spawn camp.

As to grouping... that's not the key. The drop rate is absolutely 
maxxed, now that they are green, I simply cannot kill the skeletons 
faster, and with the druid nailing the entire undead population south of 
the river as fast as they spawn I'm killing them as fast as the zone 
will generate them. Maybe 15 undead per 5 minutes. And I've been doing 
that for 2 nights in 8 hour shifts. (SK is gaining maybe a yellow a 
night due to the fairly rare mummies)

Compound this with 3 races needing the damn thing, 2 of them starting in 
Nek (Troll SKs, and DE SKs), and a 3rd race showing up (Eru) because 
camping calcified in Toxx is even worse. And its an utter sham... and 
then to top it off the item is no drop too so if anyone else is lucky 
enough to snag one odds are it will rot unless an SK is logged in and 
advertising.

No. The newbie quests are not at all well implemented.

The spelling/grammer mistakes, pronoun issues, and unidentifiable 
faction requirements have made the quest system unreasonably difficult 
at times.

I wonder how many of them are even worth doing at this point... :)

And again the faction issues... maybe being Ally with the Crushbone Orcs 
will open up a quest... but is it really reasonable to expect us to hunt 
Kelethin Guards or whatever until we get there? And then wander the 
entire world hailing everything all over again?

If there is a quest like that... the bartender in Neriak should say 
something along the lines of 'I hear the Crushbone King is looking for 
the right kind of person to handle a 'something', but those orcs aren't 
too trusting. (in other words there should be a reasonably accessible 
lead in somewhere...)

Way back when, when people were trying to RP a bit more, you'd have 
ogres hosing their faction with the 'good cities' hoping to get in with 
the 'evil'... but it never panned out... the 'evil' races never seemed 
to have anything to say... and now nobody even tries. Its was a losing 
proposition.
