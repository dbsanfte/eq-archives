It was indeed very annoying.  You've just done something that was beyond 
you, and died.  You've been smacked with a heavy XP penalty, and have 
learned your lesson.  So what do you have to do?

You have to go back to the place that you've just learned you should not 
go, and you have to do it without your best equipment (or without any 
equipment if you don't have a backup set).
