If bizbee is such a problem then here is a solution.  Create a message rule
in Outlook Express and eliminate the posters that you don't want to read.  I
have created one that works wonders for me.  I eliminate bizbee and his fan
club and still have plenty of worthwhile content to read.  It is really
simple and it gets rid of a lot of "noise" on the group.

Apply this rule after the message arrives
Where the From line contains <snip snip> or <snip snip> or
'tuberoo@ix.netcom.com' or <snip snip> or <snip snip>
Mark it as read

I don't think I will go into details regarding my messages rules, so the
snips are just to eliminate any debate that follows regarding my opinion of
a bizbee "fan club".  It isn't worthy of debate.  Besides, it is just my
opinion and I will read what I choose.
