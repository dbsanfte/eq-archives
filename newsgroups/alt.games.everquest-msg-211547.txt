My experience is exactly the reverse.  The people who understand that
"it's just a game" are the people who don't get all upset and scream
at their guildmates after a wipeout.  They may want nice gear, but
they don't obsess about it or try to scam people to get it.

I try to "play nice" with the other people that I play with.  But it
is just a game, and as far as I'm concerned
