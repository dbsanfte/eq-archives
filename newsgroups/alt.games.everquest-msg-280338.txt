Actually, Kelin's Lucid Lullaby, a level 15 song, is the first mez a 
bard gets, I've been happily mezzing away for some time now, and I'm 
still 4 levels short of 28.  I think Lullaby only works on mobs up to 
level 30, which will mean a bard doing yellow/red mobs at 27 might have 
some trouble... but its only a problem for a level or two.  The other 
crowd control device bards have at hand is Charm, which can be far more 
effective than simply mezzing a mob, turning an add into additional DPS; 
the first charm is attained at 27

The addition of the /melody command makes it possible for anyone to play 
a "great" bard by this definition, automating the twisting of up to four 
songs.  While manually twisting allows for more control, and a great 
bard will certainly do so in tense situations, a good melody setup can 
do wonders to relieve the intense strain on tendons which has sidelined 
many a bard.
