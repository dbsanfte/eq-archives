For what it's worth, I sympathize.  My sister, someone I would candidly
say is very attractive, has often been extremely paranoid about the men in
her life, and as such, if one of them made the "mistake" of saying he
liked asian women (she also bein ga blonde like your wife) she would never
drop it.  I can easily see the whole thing, and I pity any man in that
situation.  Or, for that matter, any woman with an insecure husband.

*grin* I won't, because I would be lying. I _will_ remind you though (I
suspect you probably know this) that insecurities do not automatically
translate into heckling your spouse/lover.  I have things I don't like
when I look in the mirror, but that doesn't mean I make my husband pay for
it!  I don't think I'm so unusual in this.

I'll admit right now...ANY manicure-perfect specimen of the high school
age with the latest fashions on will have me scurrying for cover
fast.  Bad memories there.  That's not the kind of "intimidated" you
meant, though.

*cough* I can't speak for other people and their fetishes, but I would
venture that the old models, being so cartoony, did leave more for me to
form my own mental picture of what my character looked like.  Sort of like
what Kaev said.  But more than that, it's just a question of simple
proportion.

Ditto on the hair.  Not so ditto on the arms...they are still too
skinny to carry those massive weapons.  I was always embarassed to have my
half-elf carrying a Tox Axe. It's magic...it's gotta be.
