And your skill at Ignoring the point has increased! (101)  As you pointed
out...  -int doesn't do anything, so why worry?  Where as Plat Arms doesn't
ding you for anything but AC, but AC won't matter much if you can't get
away...  How is this dodging the question?  It isn't.  It does address an
issue I mentioned before, which you have completely ignored twice now.  Now
if you stop acting like Dr. Evil and insisting on talking to the hand...

Meanwhile, talk to the hand, Ben...  Since you seem to like doing that a
lot.
