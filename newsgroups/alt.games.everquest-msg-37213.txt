There are so many items in the game (way over 10,000), that
an "item guide", type unspecified, would be too enormous to be
useful.

Let us know what kind of item guide you want, and we'll point
you in the right direction.

For example, if you want an item list for armor that your
race/class can wear, check out:
   http://www.eqprices.com/PriceGuide.shtml

You may need a subscription to access that page, but it's
well worth the small fee.  You can also get item lists
by various search criteria for free at that site's
homepage, http://www.eqprices.com

If you want an item guide for the items that drop in
a particular zone, go to:
   http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/itemzone.html

For a list of items known to be required for quests:
   http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/listitem.html?invslot=Quest

For a list of Paladin armor ranked by a "points" system
(which unfortunately has not been updated to include
the Velious armors):
   http://www.uvm.edu/~pjp/paladin_item_rankings.html

For a list of common resist gear:
