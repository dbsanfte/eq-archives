Well, I guess I was wrong.  I said that Manaburn would not be nerfed to
prevent a small group of Wizards from burning down a mob at the same time,
because that use of Manaburn is *so* *freaking* *obvious* that there was no
way Verant could not have intended it.  Even with their pathetic testing,
they could not have missed that.

Oops....looks like they really were that dumb.  Geesh!
