About the only REAL thing they get is one step closer
to a flunky game CS GM job, at approximately minimum wage
or a couple bucks more. I think some actual on site verant GMS
did start in the lowly guide system, probably more that lived nearby
as opposed to having to relocate.

This does seem to be the best way for the untalented to make it into
the gaming business. The only real requirements are probably taking
English in High School and then taking up to English composition or
advanced comp in college. At that point you will certainly be able to
write well enough to be the next Absor/Abashi. They either worked
their way up in this game or came from another. If I lived in the same
city as Verant I'd probably actually try this, already having a
customer service background. There is no way I could afford to move
there and live on what they'd pay you starting out as a GM though.
