> Hi y'all... Since I play at such erratic times, it's really hard to find
people I can play with on a consistent basis.  So, I decided to create a
"BYOG" 3-person trio.  Now, I'm at the level where I need advice on a
hunting grounds.  What I'm ideally looking for is a spot that a puller can
pull do, with a limited amount of adds.  A spot tailored to a tank, that has
healers.  (Basically, I find it difficult to cast anything other than heals
& buffs with the occasional DD/DoT thrown in).  Anyways, I suppose I should
lay out the group setup...

Frostbringer, has SCHW, and hodge-podge armor.  The Cleric & Druid both have
WIS around the 220-ish level.

Dawn Shrowd Peaks...Forget that the Hoppers aren't up, the Sambata still
good exp.
Invis/Camo all characters use auto follow on warrior to lead them down to
the bottom cave.
Down here you will find various types Tribalists but most will be blue.
Shaman is, well, a shaman, have cure Disease up to get rid of his slows.
Tribal Leader is place holder for the guy that swaps Sambata back to
Hoppers, he's no where near as tough as the Big Grey Mofo that does the
reverse (age old rockhopper) Sambata Tribal advisor is one of two things, if
he has been fixed (big IF) he's look like a tribalist and be a low 40's
Cleric...if not he'll look like an Erudite male and be a 60th Necro, so stay
well away. Be aware that if the Rockhoppers are up and you are down here,
the larger Hoppers (Elder and his place holder, who's just as mean but no
special name) do not snare so start nuking/stunning when they start to walk.

If you want some better loot, pool room in Sky Shrine (no key needed to get
in from CS zone) you'll an invis to get past the Wyverns at the top of the
tower. Guardians and Gargoyles drop 4 - 6pp +gold and change, as well as
Velium Bricks and pieces (sell well in the Bazaar...when they fix the
locking up bug they will, anyway) the Guardians can drop Guardian Armour, no
drop some if it is nice (legs and helm good for cleric, legs for Warrior
when saves are needed, girdle and shoulders good for warrior) and 2
sentries, who can drop sentry armour, some is no drop but the droppable
pieces go for a decent amount. Exp is ok, at 52 about 50% of the mobs are
Blue the rest Light blue and green. Leave the Drakes that are in the corner
at the sentry end well alone but the couple closest to the zone point won't
be much bother. The statue in the pool is a zone out (I am told you need the
key to use it, never have) keep an evac mem'd in case someone brings some
adds to this zone point...mobs outside of this area are a little tougher and
a lot more MR.

Gnoll Caves in Jagged Pine Forest (map on EQAtlas had them down as Kobold
Caves, if you are using that map) pretty much all in here will be Blue, some
of them are SK's and I recall some healer class down there too, good exp but
was very busy when I was last there (may be quieter now) and I had problems
of people trying to pull thru me...this won't happen, if you are fighting a
Gnoll then the new pull will stop and help out, best thing to do here is
evac, while boxing 3 you can't run...the inconsiderate puller just gets an
Extra Gnoll or 2 and you need to find somewhere else to
hunt...unfortunately, when running 3 you are at the mercy or morons and
really need to avoid them. This is the same with Sambata/Hoppers, btw, last
moron that did this there, when I asked him if he could possibly wait until
my fight was over next time before pulling thru me as it'll just end up as
my add, shouted (I gave him a tell) that I didn't own the zone and he could
do what he wanted, /sigh

Scarlet Desert, various mobs will be blue here, some will be light blue to
the Warrior.

OOT Sea Fury Cyclops...Islands always pretty busy but a fast spawn time
normally means the Island can support 4 or 5 groups.

Other than that I am not sure...I was going to look for new hunting grounds
but as Incomplete Heal (as someone aptly named it) is pretty much out of my
reach I'm in no rush.

As real group of 3 players you could handle so much more but I well know
that when 3 boxing what you can do is limited, I normally try to stay at the
bottom end of Blue scale.
