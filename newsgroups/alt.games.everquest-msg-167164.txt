I had this happen once when I was a wee alt twink of 8, but other than that, never.

Thats a heinous violation, I can't think of anything more personal than your choice
of bind spot.

Once upon a time you could bind anyone, invis anyone.  Both these actions could
really screw up someone's day, so Verant made it so you had to be grouped to do it.

Now, though, with confirmation boxes for TL and Rez, why they don't change that
back so you get confirm to bind, I have no idea.

Knowing the weirdness of the guys at Sony, though, I keep expecting an item with
combat effect AE Bind

Wouldn't THAT screw up your day!
