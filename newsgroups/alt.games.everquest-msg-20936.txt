From a 39 magician - It was BROKEN.  Big time.  When
a minor water conjuration (max level = 29) can out taunt
mid 30's rangers, sk's and warriors, and the mob sticks to
them regardless of what they do, it's broken.  In order to
keep my pet for more than a few combat rounds (a sabertooth
tiger can pound a focused water pet down in a very short
time) I was chain casting renew summoning.  No nuke, and
way more mana than I should have been spending.

Granted, it was nice for the soloers, but for grouping mages
it was a serious bug.  When soloing, I can still manage my
aggro well enough to only get hit a little, it's one of the skills
you learn soloing as a mage, unless you insist on using the
earth pet for a bit of root and nuke.
