PLing is NOT playing the character 1-50, and it is not playing the
"1-50 game". The two are apples and oranges.

There is NO comparison between taking a Rogue (using your new alt as
an example) 1-50 soloing or grouping with characters of equal level,
and PLing 1-50 with a multi-box setup with level  60+ characters.
There is no way you can know the weaknesses or hardships that a class
faces 1-50, when you PL through those levels, and/or twink equipment.

I am not knocking you or PLing. I am merely pointing out that your
perception of a classes weaknesses (eg the "Monk Nerf") as discussed
in this thread, is colored by your non-standard playing style. There
is nothing wrong with the way you play. It is just that you are in a
completely different class than the average player.
