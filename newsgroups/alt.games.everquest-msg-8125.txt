That was me, and yes I retracted it.  I have since (with a *LOT* more
Bone Chips) finally seen one of the Cabilis factions budge slightly
(CrusadersOfGreenmist are now "threatening" instead of "scowls", but
that still means they'll kill me if they catch me).  So I now have
positive proof that the factions ARE moving (albeit at glacier speeds).

Right.

I have since found some NPCs just inside Cabilis (the "Furscale"
pair) that I presume are on CabilisResidents faction (same as
the merchants) but who are not themselves merchants, so I can get
a "true" /con on them.  They are still "scowls", so I have my work
cut out for me if I want to eventually bank/buy/sell.

The scary part is that I'm about 40 quest completions away from the
point where, if I haven't moved them up to "threatening" by that point,
doing the rest of the 2000 full quest completions (to "faction maxed"
point) will NOT achieve "apprehensive" status, and thus I won't ever
be able to bank/buy/sell despite my huge amount of work/time spent
on this faction project...   I'm keeping my fingers crossed, and praying
for a CabilisResidents /con change during the next 40 attempts.
