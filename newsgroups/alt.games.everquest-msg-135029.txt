Of course it does mean that.

If I am selling a car that gets 5 miles to the gallon, seats one, and
has a top speed of 20 miles per hour, demand isn't going to be
very high.  If we discover that we forgot to open up the carborator
in the factory, so a simple twist of a screwdriver turns it into one that
seats four, gets 50mpg and cruises comfortably at 100mph, then
the value of the thing is going to go way up.  Supply same, but
better item, means demand goes up and therefore price can go up.

Focus effects in some cases made relatively lame items into quite
desirable ones.  Why wouldn't the value dramatically increase
in those cases?
