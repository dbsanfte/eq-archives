SOE has demonstrated they can treat summoned pets differently
than charmed pets - I wish this was one such instance they'd
do it, and allow BL/Mage/Necro pets to tank for a group without
good regular healing.  Way back when, I was in a few groups where
I was main healer because, at 29, my pet was the same level as
most of the melee's in my group, and we had no healer for them
except for a ranger - so my pet tanked.  The key back then was
positioning.  With a skilled puller and a bit of timing the
pet was fighting the mob from so close that it was easy for
the melees to engage and stay farther out.
