I'm a druid (please insert jealous quad-kiting comments here) I'm also
irritated, irritated by people who completely take advantage of druids. I'm
level 54 and on the times when I do decide to go looking for a group it can
be an hour or more before I can get a group in KC or basically anywhere else
simply for the fact that I'm a support class. I get irritated and move to a
place where I can quad and get yelled at there. People seem to have a real
problem with druids unless of course it is to say "sow plz" or "may i bum a
port" or any of the other sniveling crap that people do. I charge for almost
all ports because of this unless your a chanter willing to trade buffs for
port, a cleric (cant burn bridges with clerics especially when looking for a
rez) also corpse run ports are free because they suck. I tell you what
though every other class in game gets charged for it, call me a ho if you
want but thats the way I am. I am guilded and do not mind porting any of my
guild members. I don't really have a point to this other than perhaps this,
Invite your druids who are looking for a group, you never know when your
going to need a port and if a druid remembers that you were cool to him/her
your chances of getting something are much better. Feel free to flame me or
whatever I don't care
