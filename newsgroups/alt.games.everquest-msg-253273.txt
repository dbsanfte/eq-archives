I would think you had best ask them on an individual basis. I imagine 
some are roleplaying, some have multiple personality disorder, some 
might be indulging in some offbeat kink/fantasy, some have gender 
assignment issues, and I'm sure theirs even a sick fuck or two out there.

No problem at all there.

Bingo. But you already know the score. What happens when she encounters 
some guy at the mall who's taken with him/her and requests a lunch date 
and phone number? Should s/he accept? S/he already knows he's come to a 
conclsusion about him/her that is likely way off, should s/he lead him 
on for two years of casual lunch dates, and friendly flirting, all the 
while playing at being a mono-gender of the assumed type whenever he's 
around, and keeping the truth out of sight.

At what point does he derserve to know the truth? If he's fallen for 
Roberta shouldn't he know about Robert? Right from the get go? I think 
if s/he encourages him at all then s/he owes him the explanation. If our 
mall guy asks for her number and s/he's not interested, simply 
communicating to him that his attentions are inappropriate & unwelcome 
is sufficient; s/he doesn't have to confide in every twit on the street.

Intimacy is a game of the mind, and as such can take place anywhere. I 
can have lunch with a friend that's orders of magnitude less intimate 
than an "I'm running late from phone call" to my wife.
