There's an article available at

http://www.businessweek.com/technology/cnet/stories/1020180.htm

about a study done by Edward Castronova, an associate professor of
economics at California State University in Fullerton.  He says that
female characters sold on on-line auction sites like Ebay had an
average price of $281, compared to $346 for male characters and that
even when level differences were taken into account, females still
sold for an average of $41 less (or 12% less) than males.  

The article also says that even just playing the game, Mr. Castronova
said that when he played a female character he would find some players
would treat him like he was less knowledgeable about playing the game,
as compared to when he played a male character.
