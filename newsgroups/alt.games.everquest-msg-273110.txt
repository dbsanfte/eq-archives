An excellent read, and for entertainment value this came second only to 
Monual's adventures. Please keep them up, and it's a shame that you had 
to endure such pointless insults from those who could simply have 
skipped the article and left it for those of us who enjoy a glimpse into 
what lies ahead.

It's also nice to see an account by someone with experience of EverQuest 
1 as well. For me it helped to bridge the gap between the two games...it 
also added a certain something to the account that I'm having trouble 
putting into words.
