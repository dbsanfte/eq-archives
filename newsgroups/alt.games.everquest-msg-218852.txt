Good point, but there wouldn't be any reason not to do this, as
you point out, they've already demonstrated a willingness to give
different classes similar but subtly different spells.

I'm not worried about marginally useful abilities, for example
the druid pet; giving them a comperably useless pet at
significantly lower levels might be problematic, as SK have shown
there's a limit to how useless a pet can really be; a level 9 SK
pet with a rusty halberd isn't much more useless than a level 1
necro pet with a rusty halberd; both do the same damage as a
level 12 necro pet!

But I wouldn't call the cleric pet useless, at 54 to 60 its a
pretty solid contribution, particularly with the lowered mana
cost and with summon efficiency item (one of the rare classes for
which this item actually makes sense); its just not present at
all for the first 53 levels, and then fades to marginal later. 
Either don't use it as a balance tool, or give it to us from say
level 9 or 14 or something in a lesser tool so we learn how to
use it from the beginning... and give us another at 61 that keeps
the capability alive.

Why should Shaman wait till 34 for such an integral tool?  Why
should ranger wait till 51 for their Jolt?  Did Rogues have to
wait past 12 for Backstab or Evade?  Heck, Monks shouldn't have
to wait till 19 for FD, although FD isn't really all that bad to
get to these days, without it are they really learning how to
play monks at all, or are they just biding their time as rangers
without bows?

A good example of what you are talking about for paladins are the
bard pick lock skills; there are very few locks in the game that
a bard will ever be able to pick, and none that a bard with the
skill has any interest in (well MAYBE the entrance to the hole,
but since I've never seen anyone actually bother opening it, it
would take a graphic fix for that to see usefulness). Either put
in locks of varying skill ranges so that bards can open some
useful ones, or just eliminate the skill for bards so they won't
waste their time.  Once upon a time there were no useful locks
for rogues either, so bards all cap out their lockpicking skill
just in case SOE suddenly sees the light.
