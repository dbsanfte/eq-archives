So here it is day 12 of Nov. in Canada and still no sign of the the
collectors edition, so SOE does it again, pay a premium price and get the
least.

I was hyped and geared to go after doing beta, now with this much time away
to think twice about it, I'm going to bail out on EQ2 all together and spend
more time finding RL things to do that are worthy of my time.

Best of luck SOE, you've lost an old fan, but I will gain a life.

lol
