oh wait, there is 1 final thing (for now) ... i must be misunderstanding
something about my speakers:

5.1 channel speakers ... 1 woofer, 1 front, 1 pair for front-right and 1
pair for front-left ... that's 6 plugs on the input of the woofer that i
can't connect to my computer ... it only has 3 ... and it labels them as
"center/woofer, FL/RL, FR/RR" ... so .. do i just need to buy a splitter?
well, 3 splitters? how will the signal "know" where to go?

the onboard sound card is supposedly 7 (or 7-something) channel ... is that
a problem, or does it mean i could have bought better speakers?

again, all help appreciated...
