I was wondering that my self. Or does the +3 just add directly to
the already calculated damage. So would the 8/20 weapon have
a range of 1-17+3 = 3-20, or is it like you said an 11/20 weapon
making the range 1-23?

Hmm, I havent seen any of those yet.

Lots of discussion of this at eqtraders forum. I don't think there has
been a concensus yet. This kind of thing would take a lot of testing.
Need very large sample size. One person had MORE failures and
less skill ups using an item, but it was too samll a sample size to be
conclusive

I think it just adds to the success chance of making an item. In which
case a 5% item would be a lot I think. I hope Verant tested this.

Also, the reason people are upset about dolphins being caught in
tuna nets and don't give a shit about the tuna is because dolphins
are cute and tuna is butt ugly and goes good with mayonnaise.
