Quoted from the New hackers dictionary;

The phrase stems from a 1991 adaptation of Toaplan's "Zero Wing" shoot-'em-up
arcade game for the Sega Genesis game console. A brief introduction was added
to the opening screen, and it has what many consider to be the worst
Japanese-to-English translation in video game history. The introduction shows
the bridge of a starship in chaos as a Borg-like figure named CATS materializes
and says, "How are you gentlemen!! All your base are belong to us." [sic] In
2001, this amusing mistranslation spread virally through the internet, bringing
with it a slew of JPEGs and a movie of hacked photographs, each showing a
street sign, store front, package label, etc. hacked to read "All your base are
belong to us" or one of the other dopy lines from the game. When the phrase is
used properly, the overall effect is both screamingly funny and somewhat
chilling, reminiscent of the B movie "They Live".
