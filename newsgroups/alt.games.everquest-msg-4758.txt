It's a shame you're not on Zeb...I've got 2 CGSes in the bank with no plans
for them (I don't know how much to ask for them and don't want to bother
with auction anyway).

If you can get a full group from 24-30 you can hunt the EXG
yourself...that's what I did.  Might even try to camp Gabbie too (the EXG
wanders right near her) for the Molten Cloak (4 WIS I think).

Very close to the EXG on the other end of her run is the Reckless Efreeti
who drops the Platinum Armband, +3 WIS.

But SolA is (probably on every server) a Bring Your Own Group zone. :-/
