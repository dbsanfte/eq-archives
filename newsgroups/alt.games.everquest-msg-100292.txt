Yes, it's true. I've bug reported it many times because it just HAS to
be a bug. You don't put a friggin' level 9 song in a place that's
guarded by a level 35+ zone.

Actually, the bard vendors on Luclin are just bugged good all-around.
There is a vendor in Shar Vahl that carries songs 1-7. The vendor ten
feet away ALSO carries these songs along with a whole slew of other
songs that you'd normally have to run all over Norrath for. (Vah Shir
bards don't know how easy they have it...) However, if you check all
these songs, you'll find that many of the slots that should have
advanced songs have Chant of Battle instead. The vendor's inventory is
corrupted and has been that way since the release of Luclin. I haven't
checked since the latest patch but I feel confident that they are
STILL bugged. My guess is that the first vendor I mentioned should
actually have the five Luclin-only songs on him.

As it stands now, the new songs are only in Katta. Oh, and I noticed
the last time I was there that the song vendors in Katta are also
bugged but not quite as badly as the vendors in Shar Vahl. I'm
guessing this hasn't been a big problem for Vah Shir bards just
because most of them leave Luclin after they're able to safely travel
through Paludal.

My advice - If you're not level 30, don't bother. The sustenance song
is an interesting idea but mostly pointless and the server economies
on every server but FV are mature enough that you can easily get a
cheap velium weapon so the level 9 song is mostly useless as well.
I'll qualify that a bit - Given the recent changes regarding
respawning after death, it might actually be fun for a level 9 bard to
get bound in Shar Vahl and try to get to Katta. No loss if you're
creamed and a story to tell if you make it. A level nine bard with a
bit of plat in the bank would find the Combine musical instruments
another good reason to try and run the gauntlet of Grimling
Forest/Tenebrous Mountains.

But if you've got a corpse to lose, I'd have to say it's not worth the
risk until you're ready for the level 30 Amplification song. THAT'S a
good song. A mid-20's who didn't have a mistmoore drum might also find
it profitable to make the run to get a Combine drum and other
instruments as mentioned above. Invis won't help you in Tenebrous so
don't bother. Just run like the wind and don't stop for anything.
