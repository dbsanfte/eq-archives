They probably do that for witnesses. In spite of what people here are
saying, IT IS against verant policy for someone to KS a spawn which
you are spawning in a quest. 

I know this first hand from my guild and another waiting for ragefire.
Though we cleared the FGS and had a capable force in SOLB, this other
cleric and not enough people to even do the thing were there waiting
too. When ragefire guy spawned she handed it in fastest, boom, we were
done. We heard from a GM before that according to verant the PERSON
STARTING THE QUEST POP MOB, gets the kill and the loot. To take it at
that point would be breaking rules. So, while they died since they
could not handle it, we politely left. We knew the rules but we'd be
damned if we were going to help them. Later they mangaged to get help
from some other uber guild and the other uber guild later apologized
to us for helping the usurper because they did not know the details.

So in this case, announcing it is saying "i am doing this quest, it is
a quest REPOP of fergul and NOT the normal fergul. If you interfere it
is against the policies of verant." You could actually say that,
spelling it out. Verant recognizes quest spawning right, they
recognize it on ragefire and on the scout in WW. They can also check
on it, if they bother.

Like you though, when I did this quest I was wiser and instead waited
to do it at 5:30 am when no one else was in the zone hardly but 3
people doing kodiaks or something ;) I had zero problem with the quest
and no one watching though at the time it took me A LONG TIME to kill
the guy since I was level 51 and never had the wisdom to buy ES vambs
(After this kill I finally did, having learned the lesson ;) )

Killstealing a poppled mob with quest items IS a violation. Its not
spelled out clearly enough in the rules but every GM I've talked to
when such a problem came up said that it was. It makes no difference
if its ragefire or some other quest items you worked for.
