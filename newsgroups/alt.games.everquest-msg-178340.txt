Prayer
(Print the Lyrics)


Another dream that will never come true
Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add on to your pain and suffering
Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you completely
All the cries you're beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

Another nightmare about to come true
Will manifest tomorrow
Another love that I've taken from you
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering
Another taste of the evil I breed
Will level you completely
Bring to life everything that you fear
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

Return to me x3
Turn to me
Leave me no one

Turn to me
Return to me x2
Turn to me
Cast aside

Return to me x3
Turn to me
Leave me no one

Return to me x3
You've made me turn away

Living just isnt hard enough
Burn me alive inside
Living my life's not hard enough
They take everything from you
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away
