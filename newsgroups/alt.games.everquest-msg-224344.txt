I was giving him a mob that was already debuffed and at 75% health, and my
pet was about to die, so that wouldn't be an issue.  I was close to dying.
It's common courtesy to help someone out if you can.

Thing is, this was in Rathe Mountains, where some people get nasty competing
for hill giants.  Even though I was handing him one that I'd already
softened up, he apparently was more content to watch me die or gate so he
could get *both.*  If he'd helped, we would've both been happy.  If he'd not
been there, I wouldn't even care.  And I agree; it's *not* his
repsonsiblity, but it sure as heck is rude.  Considering he was moving,
watching me, had a pet, and was clearly scouting, I can't think of any
reason to let me die other than to get the mobs as "soft" as possible first,
or because I once kicked his dog or something.

I'm not even sure how the comparison to the Druid comes in...
