People have already tried all variations of 1 each of the
sages combines (Note + Binding/Spell + Word) in both
the sage's box and an elemental Grimoire - all 125 combinations
are DNC

If this quest is supposed to result in anything more than
the PoS 5 charge items, or the trivial gem+xp for turning
that item into the assistant, then it is either A) still
broken, or B) there isn't enough information to point to the
next step.
