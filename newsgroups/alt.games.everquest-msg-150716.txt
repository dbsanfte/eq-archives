Cant agree with that when you consider the physics involved. Two
one-handed weapons must of necessity be lighter weight therefore less
damaging to maintain balance, the  advantage is speed of course. Now
swing 2 three foot bamboo canes (one inch dowels will do) in each hand
for a while then try two 6 foot quarter staffs, you will quickly see
the difference. Now drop one of the staffs and swing the one
two-handed, slower than the canes yes but much more devastating when
it hits. Slower speed but much higher damage, if anything they don't
give the two handers enough damage. Trust me been hit with both in my
younger days and can tell you one can hurt you the other can kill. 

My point is that double attack is independent of weapon speed and thus
must favor the slower weapon with the higher damage. Also since haste
is a percentage increase in attack speed it also favors the slower
weapon. And yes my monk primary weapon is 33/36, and I still pull too
much agro lol. Makes me think twice about that IFS Ive been drooling
over.
