AFAIK simply preordering the game was not enough, you had to actually pick 
up a pre-order box.  In the box was a CD that allowed you to pre-create 
characters so they would be ready at launch, some EQ2 movie material, etc. 
Along with the CD was a key code like the key code that came with your 
retail EQ2 CD/DVD.  Using that key code you could unlock your jboots.

BTW, the jboots are not like the jboots you may be familiar with from EQL. 
First, you dont activate them you just wear them and automaticly activate; 
second, they add like 10% to your run speed not the 90% of SoW or so that 
they give in EQL.  If you play a scout, or any other class with a speed 
ability/spell, you will want to give the jboots to another of your 
characters.
