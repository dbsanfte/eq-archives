I used the launchpad on SWG and planetwhatever. It's annoying, yes, but 
not too bad once you get used to it. If it would let me log straight 
through like SWG after entering my username/password (go straight into 
the character I usually want on the server I usually want automagically) 
I would like it on EQ, just for that.

It expects to go in c:\program files\sony\station\launchpad iirc.
It expected SWG to be in c:\program files\sony\star wars galaxies or 
some such.

But, it does actually recover from lack of registry. I moved my SWG 
installation (c:\games\swg) wholesale to another machine by lan copy, 
and moved the station directory too. Ran it, it bitched about not 
knowing where SWG was, asked (and suggested program files etc...) I 
pointed it at the right spots, it repatches itself (not swg) restarted, 
and boom, God was in his heaven and all was right with the world.

Then next patch decided to delete every file in the SWG directory except 
user data. Of course, was beta, we lived through 2 of those.

(BTW something SWG did during beta that they tossed that greatly annoyed 
me when they removed it. It saved all my hotkeys, macros, aliases, 
screen layout, camera settings, interface style, keymappings, etc on the 
server. No more going over to a friends and going 'ok where the hell is 
the default key to turn the light on').
