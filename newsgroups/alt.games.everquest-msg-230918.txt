Still have that issue.  Whose time do you use for timenow and timelast?

First position arrives 3 seconds late, server grabs it's current time as 
timelast.

Second position arrives with no appreciable lag, server grabs it's 
current time for timenow.

Ban player for exploiting.

You'd have to build a lot more into it than just that simple test to 
allow for the possibility of lag causing issues with the times.

If you are using the local computer to get a time, well, so long as 
packets are being fudged with anyway...
