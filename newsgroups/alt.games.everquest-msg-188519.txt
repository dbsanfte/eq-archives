I don't see how me "growing a national backbone" would change anything to
the traditional redneck french bashing in general, or a generation of news
reader educating themselves about france in that bashing, or more
specifically in that moronic post about "french military victories" you seem
to refer to.

The reposting of it shouldn't last too long now. The title will be something
like HILARIOUS, in all caps, or so. And after the 100 line of cutandpasted
bs, there will be a clever commentary like : "no wonder these pussies won't
help to KICK BUTT in irak."

'Tis a pain, and boring, too. You didn't have to remind me.

I'm afraid your the google-esque nature of your knowledge shows. We were
kicked out of indochina, true. You replaced us (the red were coming) and you
called it vietnam. Not a good example maybe?

For a real good real definition of "pulling shit" use that google again and
go search the casualties on the north vietnamese side, and its
militar/civilian ratio. You can also try the same searches adding the words
"orange" and "birth", for real fun.

But the main point is that there is no "hypocrisy" at all. Algerie and
indochine here are teached in school, every little frenchman knows as a part
of the history course. That's precisely, imo, one of the reasons or french
scepticism about usa "taking it's responsibilities".

Guess what? At the beggining of the colonization movement that lead france
and a few others to "pull shit" on a big part of the world, we had the same
discourses here you can hear now in usa. "Our duty to civilize these people"
blahblah, "they'll thank us afterwards", blah, "help them to progress" blah.

How noble and great these ideals, hu? Well if you look very carefully,
you'll see that the nobler the ideal, the juicier the oil fields around,
bigger the gold mines, the comfier the geostrategic position etcetcetc.

Every country where is teached a minimal healthy dose of critisize about
itself will have that same "yeah right" reaction and look for the real
reasons if the politician are trying to convince that war is the only
option.

But not in us : they are the good guys. Must be true, it's on fox news.

So in short yes. I wonder what level of naivety and/or ignorance of history
it takes to believe someguy who's telling you he's going to invade a country
full of oil fields out of altruism.
