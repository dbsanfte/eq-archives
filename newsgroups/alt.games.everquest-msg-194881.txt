Breaking the king room with 2 enchanters is doable if they have Fascination
(upgrade ae mez) and glamour of kintaz (because of fast recast time, not
duration or low resist needs)...if you have a druid or enchanter-trained
clerics with their job soley being to keep the enchanter alive.  My guild's
problem is lack of shaman and those come in damned handy on King run because
the enchanters will likely be too busy mezzing to slow everything (and
that's absolutely crucial).

If you're farming the King, a single group of 54+ shouldn't have much
trouble keeping the king's room clear, though with that few people you're
going to want to make sure you stagger the AFKs.

If you're going the long way, my guild has lots of experience wiping in the
library. :p   We're a lot higher now than before (social guild averaging
level 56+) so we could blow through the library NOW, but I still have
nightmares about that room. :)

The last 3 times we've pulled King room into the hall before, we somehow
ended up with the King.  We didn't pacify though...you'll probably want to
consider doing that. :p  But expect the King anyway.
