You are quite wrong, most any solo capable class can solo in at least some 
of the planes.  Soloing in PoN is fun and easy.  Well, it is easy now.  I 
first started soloing there at level 57 without my epic.  It was a struggle 
to kill each mob, with KEI.  At 58, with my epic, it suddenly became easy.  
PoD is also quite soloable by a shaman, and, I understand that PoJ is 
doable, the rats there are probably the lowest level mobs in any of the PoP 
planes.  I know SKs solo in PoD, and elsewhere, as do Rangers in PoJ, 
enchanters in a variety of planes.  Really any solo capable class can do so 
in some of the planes, if they choose the right place that suits their 
playstyle, and do it at the appropriate level.

All that being said, I would not try it at level 47 in any of the planes, 
the mobs hit very hard, and, at 47, you will likely get too many resists.

Personally, when I solo, I head to PoN to do so.  I solo the nightstalkers, 
and most any of the yard trash, spiders, ravens, treants.  I skip the bats 
now, as they are lt blue to me.
