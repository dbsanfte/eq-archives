Sort of moved. Chimp ended up back on Tunare as that was where he came from,
but his gear in on Xev  ready for me to move him over when able... my new GF
being a lot younger tends to keep my wallet light with hectic weekends.
Still, there is a positive side...*coughs politely* ... and that account has
expired so it's not costing to upkeep.

My original pre-Chimp account was on Xev so I reactivated it and moved all
the gear from it's multiple alts onto one brand new Scantily Clad Druidess
who is now 28.

One thing I have noticed is it sure is busy in the lowbie zones on Xev,
cripes!
