Well - VI has done it this time
They fixed the pet tracking exploit (nothing wrong there)
Broke 2 focus items (those who say the ring still works
point to logs that don't prove anything because the timing
is too coarse in there, others have stopwatched spells and
say they aren't casting faster.  No glow on casting, no
indication on right clicking the spell that the casting
time has changed.  The earring also no longer glows.)

and the biggest whine -
the level 59 necro pet now has a max damage of 71.  The
epic pet has a max of 67.
