	"What's been done" is an awful lot.

	In fact, nothing that has been done in commercial muds on the PvP issue is
now.  Neither is anything that has been proposed.  It's all been done in
amateur muds for decades.

	It didn't work there, either.

	It's a pretty common fallacy to repeatedly claim that an idea is valid in
spite of history showing otherwise, always blaming the implemenations and not
the underlying theory.  That's what is going on here.

|plethora of other flaws doom it.

	Actually, I just picked it up.  I expect I'll hate it, but the client was
$9.99 at Best Buy and I figure I'll play it for a month and toss it out.
Perhaps it will surprise me.  Not betting on that.

|regard in other areas.

	MMOG's do not need world elements.  Their players do not want world
elements, even the ones who say they do.  Sim Earth isn't fun for the sims;
it's fun for the guy controlling them.

|I begin to feel its pointless to even talk to you when your basis of

|PvP, you are making yourself out to be rather ignorant and irrelevant.

	You are not illustrating any difference between random ganking and other
forms of PvP.

|As I've (and now others) have already pointed out to you, RvR

	Except you dismiss DAoC, too.
