I just upgraded to an Radeon ATI 8500 from my Voodoo 4, and I'm
getting the same effect (seeing the inside of the head when fighting).
That's with the latest available drivers.  (7206, I believe).  This
did not happen with the Voodoo 4, so I'd say it's a problem that
occurs with this particular card.
