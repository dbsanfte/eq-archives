   the solution to the mouse pointer is simple.  hit F10 three times.  It
will be gone the first time you tap F10 but you will have to do the other
two to bring it back to default mode.  Another solution is to change your
mode through the eqclient.ini. (at least I think that is the name of the
file.  It has been a while since I changed mine.)  If you choose full screen
with overlays there are a lot of advantages and the pointer will be gone no
mater which of the two methods you pick to use.
