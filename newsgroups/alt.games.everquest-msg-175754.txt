I have a problem somewhat similarly; i was afraid my order had been
processed mutiple times. I wrote customer service and asked how many times i
was going to be billed for the expansion. They sent me a form letter about
how to log in to my account.

I logged in and found one order, but i have 2 accounts and both appear
enabled. I am afraid that i will get a bill for 10 orders or something due
to the form resending the data when the server said it wasn't accepting it,
when it turns out the server had accepted it all along...
