Actually, if someone is willing to pay the price it is absolutely
right.  How is that wrong?  I'm willing to buy a car without haggling,
so I pay list (advertised) price of $50k.  Now a friend of mine likes
to haggle and is good at it, he pays $40k for the same car.  How is
that wrong?  I was willing to pay, otherwise I would not have
purchased it. 

In regards to your point about what would be considered emergency
supplies, or things the population can not easily function without
(like gasoline or food) I agree with a certain level of price control.

But our dicsussion revolves around an item that does not constitute
such a hardship.  Nor does it seem to have a scarce season.

So at no point do I see pricing the item at 100pp to be wrong.  And
certainly not if someone is willing to pay it.
