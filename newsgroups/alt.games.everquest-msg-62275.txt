Don't think it'd make a difference. The first one listed isn't
supposed to be there. Edit the rest to say TRUE, enter game (it'll
take a little longer) and enjoy gawking at people.

As for the see through inventory and such, you need to be playing in
at least 600x800 to get it, and then you get it automatically. I play
in 480x640, so I have old style interface. However, I can change tint
and color of all the fullscreen interface windows at a whim. (I can't
remember the command for it right now, though :/ )
