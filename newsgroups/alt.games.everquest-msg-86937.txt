    Easy all the way, huh? Rogues have to be twinked beyond belief to solo
even at a snail's pace (except once they hit 60), and are bound to groups
that distrust their Pick Pockets skill. Warriors are quite possibly one of
the most defenseless classes when travelling until the mid 40's, have weak
soloing ability, and are absolutely dependent on equipment to be effective.
Enchanters die in groups more frequently than other classes, die on raids
more frequently than most, and die more frequently when soloing than most
(when they solo - it's either the inefficient way or the risky way). Clerics
have a poor ability to solo, are viewed as a "pure leech" class by many
power gamers, and are entirely unnecessary to XP groups in many of the prime
XP areas (Velk's, Fungus Grove). It's always greener on the other side.
