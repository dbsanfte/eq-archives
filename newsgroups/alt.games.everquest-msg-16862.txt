In EC someone kept shouting for a PC on something and no one answered him.  So
eventually...

Player_00 shouts, "Doesn't anyone know the price of XYZ?"
You shout, "What do you want all 143 (in EC at the time) players to say "NO!" "
You shout, "NO!"
Player_01 shouts, "NO!"
Player_02 shouts, "NO!"
Player_03 shouts, "NO!"
Player_04 shouts, "NO!"
Player_05 shouts, "NO!"
Player_00 shouts, "No I don't want that!"
Player_06 shouts, "NO!"
Player_07 shouts, "NO!"
Player_08 shouts, "NO!"
Player_09 shouts, "NO!"
