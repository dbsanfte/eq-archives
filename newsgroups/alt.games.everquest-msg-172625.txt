Thus spake <rumbledor@hotmail.com>:
>Worst case, the guide shows up and slaps you both on the hand and
>tells you to knock it off.

 A couple years ago, on Innoruuk, my guild and a few of the other all-evil
guilds were in the habit of raiding cities such as Rivervale and Freeport.
The prey we sought when doing so was intended to be 100% guards. As will
often happen in raids such as this, we would sometimes get more than we
asked for, like the bankers and the odd guild leader. I can tell you that
the bankers in both of these towns respawn fairly quickly and that nobody
there trying to use them was severely inconvenienced when this happened
(we also always apologised for killing them).  And that rogue guild leaders
can hit for triple 360's when facing you. :-)

 During one Rivervale raid in particular, it was actually us who were doing
the raiding who submitted the petitions. A particular individual had made
a level 1 alt for the sole purpose of training the guild leaders on us.
Most everyone on the raid petitioned and the training soon stopped.

 The cool part about this was that, after we had worked our way well in
to the back part of town and started pulling on a cycle, the GM of the
server at that time (most Innoruukians will know of whom I speak) showed
up and started zone-wide-shouting comments to rouse the good people of
Rivervale to defend themselves and to overpower us. This encouraged alot
of the roleplaying that was already going on. He did not interfere or tell
us to leave which I thought was pretty darned cool of him.

 Interesting things learned from these raids are that 1) you can indeed
bank when engaging the banker in melee, and 2) the uber-guards posted at
city gates are easy to get past for a raid like this - just get a class
that can invis (to get back in past them later) with a SoW to kite them
well away from the entrance so the raid members can get in past them.
