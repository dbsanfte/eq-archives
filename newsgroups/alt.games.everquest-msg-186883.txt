Ah yeah.  I forgot about that.  I nearly ran back and jumped on her at 
that low level and tried to beat her up when she attacked me for 
attacking a *rabid* one.  Pissed me off bad ;)  "I'm weeding out the 
disease you bitch!  Leave me alone!"

Of course, I was also unwittingly destroying my faction, as I was 
turning in the pelts in the temple and doing other things to make the 
'nice' people like me without balancing it with bad faction quests - ah, 
when I was young, innocent, and stupid ;)
