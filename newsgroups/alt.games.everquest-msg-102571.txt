Thank you in advance for helping with my ignorance!

I have recently bought a Centi Short Sword because I was getting tired
of the delay on my ICETOOTH'S CLAWS  (11/29) which I was using as
primary for about 9 levels.  I was trying to save for a Centi LS, but
I was weak, and came across the SS in NFP and bought it for 500pp.

For my secondary, I am using a VELIUM SHORT BLADE 
DMG 10, DLY 24.  (10/24)  - DPS: 8.75    ( a nice light weapon BTW!)

The CENTI SS is
DMG 12,  DLY 25  (11/25)   - DPS: 10.00   (sure is heavy at 5.5 !)

I thought that naturally I would want to use the weapon with the
bigger punch as Primary,  in this case the Centi SS.
but
the Velium is one point faster, and I have heard it knocked around
that you want the faster weapon in the primary hand.
or 
With stats this close does it really matter?

Time for me to move up from the claws, and I thought I could save up
faster for the Centi  if I could kill more and Die less!
