I'm not to experienced with these fine points yet, but I'd think that 
with several melee in the rear arc, that the principle push would be 
Towards the MT, not away from him.  Air pets certainly proc a push and I 
can recall serveral instances where their push was sufficient to get us 
into real trouble, till we figured out where I should position him so as 
not to push a mob off a bridge or something.

I suppose that this is dependant on the class and gear and habits of the 
MT and of the various support people involved.

I certainly saw a poor man's version of the positioning dilemna you are 
talking about while soloing my mage; get pet on the far side of the mob 
from me and he'd push it closer to me, and when it decided I looked 
tasty enough, would run off and leave pet in the lurch.  Put pet between 
me and mob, and pet would almost always reaquire aggro before the mob 
got past him; both because his proximity would actually increase, but 
also because he simply had more time to hit and proc stun and taunt.

So can -you- come up with any reason the OP would have been told keeping 
caster's to the rear of a melee would be a good plan?  Maybe they are 
supposed to use Sneak?
