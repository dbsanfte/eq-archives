   Lance says that there are in game messages that indicate that the Drogmars
are female.  I've never seen one of these, but I take him at his word.   
   But it doesn't matter.  I decided that my drogmar would be a female before I
bought her.  I dunno why, but it seemed to fit.  From a logic viewpoint, one
would assume that drogmars must come in both genders, unless they are all cloned
or something.
