And it's obvious you don't understand this game.

And this is your single biggest flaw in your understanding of how this
game works.  Damage mitigation is actually *BETTER* than damage
healed.

Cool!  I'll keep you to that.

Hahahahahahaha!

Yeah, that's the ticket.  Maybe I'll log on my level 60 cleric, or my
level 59, level 57 or even that level 54 cleric (grr...who the fuck
leveled him?  He was suppose to be for Naggy/Vox twink runs).

>That list is one step lower than my No Group list.  

Please, put me there.
If you honestly think not being able to group with you, who is showing
obvious ignorance about the underlying game mechanics is somehow a
hardship, then by all means keep thinking that way as long as you DO
NOT GROUP WITH ME!

I really doubt that.
Generally booting the guild lead of the raiding guild isn't likely.
But you're certainly welcome to try.
