Dropped on me by a guild friend. Haven't had the chance to test it on
anything big yet, since we were just faction hunting greens last night,
but with my Troll's STR this thing hits for some gawds awful damage
without even getting a crit.  With chanter haste on me I'm picturing a
serious beating in the future for the next Seb mob that I'm not MA on.

destructive of the manhood of living man, than war is destructive to his
body. Chains are worse than bayonets."
