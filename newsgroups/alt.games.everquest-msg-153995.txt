You know, Berg, I hate to admit it, but that's not a totally whacked out
idea. It would take a lot of tuning and thought to implement, but if you
could give the monks an ability to work on that would, in reality, allow
them to take more damage (or avoid it, actually) while pulling, then it
would take some of the sting out of making them worse damage sponges.
