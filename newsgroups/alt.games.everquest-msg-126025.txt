    Any post that has the word "rank" in it tends to turn into one of those.

    Give it time. If you have any questions on them, ask here - we've killed
all but the top two on the list.

    <uber_attitude> ROFL, like someone on Karana has killed half these mobs!

> Emperor Ssraeshza
> Lord Inquisitor Seru

    I'd put Seru above the Emperor. It looks like we'll be able to control
what Emperor does (our first serious, "we have a strat" attempt is this
week). Seru is a mind-numbing amount of damage and adds, even post-change.

> High Priest of Ssraeshza
> Arch Lich Rhag'Zadune

    High Priest is only tough because of the 12 level 60 or so mobs you need
to have a plan for - his melee and "special attacks" are weaker than those
of the Arch Lich. We killed AL first, but that was mostly because of the
exacting nature of the offtanking strategy needed for HP.

> Vyzh'dra the Cursed

    The other big guild on our server has killed every big mob we have -
except for Cursed. For the first time in the history of the server, another
guild is ahead of them in terms of what has been killed. They tried last
night - went from 55 people to 11 in less than 30 seconds. If you don't have
a really well-thought out strategy to deal with him, he eats you alive (AoE
charm is a bitch).

> The Avatar of War
> Shei Vinitras
> A Burrower Beast Parasite

    This ordering seems a bit wonky. There's no strategy for AoW, other than
the tank transitions (if you use those - some guilds stick with one main
tank all fight). Shei has transitions and a good deal of forced offtanking,
BP has a ring event to get to and has a major bounding box issue (with
almost AoW-level damage output) once you get to him. This is the good thing
about Luclin encounters, BTW - there's a lot of strategy in dealing with
them compared with Velious-era "main tank" mobs.

> Blood of Ssraeshzra
> Tunare
> A Glyph Covered Serpent
> Vyzh'dra the Exiled
> Xerkizh the Creator
> Sontalak v2.0
> Lord Vyemm

    Creator still gives us some problems. Sont and Vyemm give us minor
issues. The others drop when we attempt them, first time. Sontalak won't
give us issues now that we have more manaburn wizards, though. =)

    I will note at this time that at least one guild has killed Rhag One
(Rhag'Zhezum) with eight people. It would be interesting to see eight people
kill Velketor or Innoruuk.
