I'm just under LV28 (had just hit LV28 & was later in EC when a griffen
killed me, leaving me half a bubble til 28).  I'm a Dark Elf Necro.  Where
would be a good place for me to hunt at this LV?  I'm interested in decent
loot and/or coin, as well as a decent amount of EXP at the same time, where
the only down time would be me medding & healing rather than waiting on the
spawn to pop again.  I've been in SK at the splitpaw entrence but things are
getting a bit slow there.

Also any tips on what to do (spell usage/stratagy) once I hit 29?
