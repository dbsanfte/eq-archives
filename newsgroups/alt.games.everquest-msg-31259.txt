I'm at the other end fo the scale...I've been burning money to fltech
arrows to increase my skill in fletching and between 115 and 127 fletch
skills I have made just over a dozen attempts at the Trueshot....not one
has succeeded.....it is frustrating as anything.

In fact I did do a quick calculation and worked out that I have in fact
spent about twice as much as the buy price of a Trueshot improving my
skill.....just so as I could say I had done it....I may go back to making
them later but I have now spent as much time hunting to get the cash and
just buy the thing as I would have assembling components.

Thats the time comsumer, spiderling silks are ten a penny for the quest
section, wood pieces can be got in buckets (plus I got my wooden heart)
and the nut/tonic/wire section can be done in shed loads on one boat
trip..
