I would of liked that port, just to much money. I didn't have the 50plat on
me anyhow and I didn't want to cost him more time for him to camo me to get
to the bank...

Btw that was a joke.

They think about money to much.

Btw, it is my level 32 warrior. I do have problems not having solid friends
(they just kinda stopped playin for some reason...I miss the good days =p) I
dont have a guild that has 10+ people on every time. More like the last few
times less then 5 people and only one a druid.

yet ive been around for a long time, going here or there to check this or
that out. I dont really go out all the time for EXP its just not what I do
at this time in my EQ life so I have a hard time seeing why something would
cost so much.

As you said, make more then 50pp, so how come the port costs so much?
Greed?...
