Whoah. Hold up there! EQ is cookie cutter characters too, unfortunately, 
(and is one of my many pet peeves about the game)

The only thing that separates two Warriors in EQ is the skill of the 
player and the items that are equipped. The stats, abilities, skills are 
virtually identical accross all members of class X.

All the skills are capped based on class and level. The stats can't 
change from they're initial selection, and they don't vary much, and 
what variance their is in't that relevant.

The only differential is tradeskills. And its dubious whether they are 
that relevant. And its extremely dubious whether they are worth having 
for personal use (for selling key items to others sure if your into that 
merchant thing, but the expense and effort required just to make items 
for yourself is rarely justified, unless its arrows for a ranger, or 
some other similiar case)

At the higher levels they've got AA skills, which mixes things up a bit, 
but not much. Generally each class selects the same AA skills in roughly 
the same order, with some variation based on the playstyle of the 
character... but eventually every character of class X will become 
identical again as they AA up.
