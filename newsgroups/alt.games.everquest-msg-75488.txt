Been there, done that.  My 47 Pally got caught like that, looking
for the zone that is actually behind the *King*'s throne and not
the Lord's.  A party member cast levitate on me and I danced,
turned, jumped, ducked, and wiggled until I got out.  I don't
think we thought of shrink or perhaps no one there had it.  It's
a nasty, and I'm sure unintentional, trap that is a pain in the
butt.
