Not quite. Myth or no myth: bottom line the processors are still 
competing favorably in benchmarks. Granted its against cpus with lower 
clock speed, but so what? We can only compare with what is on the market 
today, and if that means a P4 3.6 gets compared with a PPC 2.0 so be it.

It doesn't matter to the customer whether or not the cpu's perform 
better at 'similiar' clock speeds. What matters is whether or not the 
cpu's perform better at similiar price points for the average consumer. 
And for the 'enthusiast consumer' what matters is 'what is the fastest 
cpu on the marget today'.

Intel has performed well on both fronts. AMD has typically provided 
slightly better performance for the dollar, although intel has been 
competitive. Intel has usually had the fastest cpu. (IBMs PPC is a great 
processor, but its a lot more complicated to discuss because of the 
entirely different culture of the more upscale Apple marketing and 
branding strategy.

Granted, in a laptop, the lower clockspeed tends to play out favourably 
in terms of power consumption. Which is why an AMD or PPC based laptop 
may be a better buy.

If the M were such a strictly superior processor. Same performance + 
less heat + less power then I would expect there to be a demand for them 
in desktops.

They aren't the fastest for the dollar, and they aren't the fastest 
overall. They may very well be 'more' suitable for office apps on 
laptops than a p4, but that suitability is earned by lower power 
consumption not better performance.

Thus you get lower power consumption and lower performance.

Hard to say. If you plan on using it for apps, apps, and apps, oh... and 
EQ once in a while... it will still fail to meet your needs, by the 
sounds of things.

People either need to strike EQ of the list of things they plan to do, 
or strike having a pile of extra battery life of the list of things they 
want. Its a tradeoff, for most people its a tradeoff. The M only makes 
sense as a far superior choice if all you want is browser, email, plus 
office.

But alas much better than their clock speed would lead most people to 
beleive is still not actually that *fast* ... they aren't as fast as the 
P4s that are availble today. (Nobody actually cares that they are faster 
than the P4s of two years ago despite being rated at the same GHz.)

True enough. Unfortunately they appear to be being bundled with the 
Centrino technology which takes the less power less performance mantra 
even further and leaves the platform decidely unsuitable for games. (At 
least that is the impression I'm getting.)

Ah well, like I said, I'm leaning towards an apple powerbook. There's no 
need to fear that I've been duped by the ghz myth. (And no illusion that 
I'll be playing EQ on it either... but that's not why i want a laptop.)
