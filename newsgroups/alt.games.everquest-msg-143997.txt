}>     The merchants in OT outpost are rip-off artists. You could have got

}Actually, the prices were quite decent... To my surprise, the OT folks liked
}my Erudite Mage. Can't remember my deity thou :) (who does, hands up? =))

On the grounds that they didn't kill you at the outpost, I'd suspect you 
are agnostic.  Ithink you're missing the point.  If you have X faction and 
Y charisma with an outpost merchant, they still only pay about 60% of what 
an average merchant you have X faction and Y charisma with will.  You may 
get a better price from the Iksar guy hanging out by the mudhole.

}Btw.. I have been conning around to see how people like me. I have come to
}the conclusion that i am liked in rather fwe places. I am going to roleplay
}this character as a hater of short folks. I have got a good start in
}Akanaon, camping one mechanic.

}I haven't even checked if i need some of these factions in my epic, but
}hell. if i am forced to deal with the midgets, i can bite the bullet, fix my
}faction temporarily and kill them all over again!
}Muaahahaa! (that is supposed to be a hideous laughter) The fools!

Be warned, some factions can be very difficult to fix.  Others are 
impossible once you go beyond a certain point.

}Man.. Talk about morning cofeine rush. What the hell did this have to do
}with the original topic =))

Welcoe to USENET.  Subject means nothing here.  Please drive through.
