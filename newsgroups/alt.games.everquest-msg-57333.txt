You seem to be making quite an assumption as to who the griefers are that
are playing mobs.  I played several, the only players I killed were player
controlled mobs.  I did hail one druid, didn't know I can't speak, and he
beamed a smile at me.  Seems to me that it would be the people who like
grief playing are the ones most likely to take to it as mobs as well, and
those players, by and large, would not be bluebie (as you put it) players.
