I've been getting similar instances all over the game.  Right click
inventory while fighting or running and halt for a second or 2.
Nothing, nada.  Then it sparks right back to life and away I go.
Never had a full lockup but haven't been to PoK lately either.

Machine is P4 2.8GHz, 1gb RAM, SATA Raid (striped 2 drives), and ATI
Radeon AIW 9700.  Normally works like a charm.

Also the once the "Find" path appears I go into the toilet no matter
where I am.
