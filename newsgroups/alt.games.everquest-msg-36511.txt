Actually its very likely that MANY such things will be in a way.

They mentioned that with luclin they will have an "auction" zone  and 
it will be complete with vendors, banks, etc and ALSO be no more than
"3 zones from anywhere in the world" via teleports anyone can use most
likely without aid. 

I don't know if that also leads to luclin or not.. but it seems that
if it doesn't that you'll get to luclin from the auction zone maybe.
One odd thing about them saying this though, it would make travelling
too easy. I'd almost think that though you got there from say SRO, you
must only be able to return to SRO since otherwise people would use
the AUCTION zone like the pots in timorous and I don't see verant
making it that easy.  I am not sure at all how they can implement
this.
