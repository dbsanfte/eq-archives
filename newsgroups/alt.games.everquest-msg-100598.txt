Hmmn - my mistake then. I was under the impression local utilities have
carte blanche to do whatever they damn well please because they act in the
"public interest" and are not a commercial company looking after their own
interests solely. It seems that for every legitimate enviromental concern
out there there are 30 rent an phD expert opposing opinion as well.
Unfortunately, for every legititimate green you get a dozen raving drooling
leftists ratbags wearing green masks as well... : (

Hmmn -  I was under the opinion it was the power of the dollar that
overturned that applecart. Too much profit to be made to be ignored by big
business. My own two cents worth is that scratch any lobby group with voice
and beneath the veneer you find the self interests of a few major
sponsers/corporations/industries. Legitimate private concerns don't have
enough money to be heard....

Somewhere, someday - someone will find a middle ground and find that it
isn't so bad after all.......

...hmmmn - as if!  *back to EQ for me methinks*
