I frankly will not believe this until someone provides screenshots and log 
files of it, with the GM name.  Saying its a Lead GM just lessens the 
belieaveablity with me.  Think about it.  No one has even said the name of 
the GM who did it.  Verant would know who this is so they would not be 
protecting him, they are not saying anything cause people want us to 
believe with no proof.
