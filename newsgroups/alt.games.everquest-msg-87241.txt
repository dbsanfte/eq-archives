Yeah, but just imagine the superb irony when you fail on your 7th shawl and 
see:

You lacked the skills to fashion the items together.
You have become better at tailoring! (163) [ because of the high int ]

That's when you yell to the other room "Honey, please call 911.  No, don't 
come in here, just call." as you stare at your fist in the monitor, trying 
to decide on whether or not your should pull it out and incur more 
lacerations or leave it in and get electrocuted.

If you want to see that kind of pain ( the skill-up, not the monitor ), 
check out Aoenla Darkwood's fletching guide skillup page:
