   Remember when the EQ Necro website had a very good hunting guide
section, divided by levels?  Sure, it was geared towards necros, but it
was valuable to other classes as well.  It went poof one day, and stayed
gone despite hopes that it might come back.  Its been quite a while now
and I think it's safe to say it isn't coming back.

    A couple of months ago, my guild accepted my application to become
the Librarian (Web Master).  Now, my HTML skills are self-taught, using
a "For Dummies" book.  Barely better than a chimp's.  In a word,
laughable.  But enough for the purpose at hand.

   For a while, even before I became the Librarian, I had been thinking
about starting a hunting guide web site.  Now I have, though it under
the guild pages.  I have a few entries that guildees have written, but
it is pretty sparse.  I'd like to add more to it before I invite others
from the FV board and here to come to it.
  
   One thing I have been playing with doing is trolling age for answers
to the ever popular "Where to Hunt" posts, and cutting and pasting those
as guide/tips.  I would also be shifting through google for more of
these.
  
   So my question is, how do you guys feel about my doing this?  I care,
because after all, they are your posts that I would be working with.  I
don't want to see any 100 thread long posts called "Annie is a Thief!",
or to get any cease and desist orders from law firms that have 5 names
in as thier company title.  I would email the person who wrote the post,
if I am able, and ask permission.  But if it is not possible, or if I
get no answer, I would be inclined to go for it (I would of course
respect the wishes of anyone that said "No").
  
 Once the hunting guide section is fleshed out, I would be trying to
promote here, on Allakazam's, and other various sites.  If the guild
were to fall part, or I were to be fired, no problem.  The guild's web
space is provided by me, on my ISP.  I could pretty easily set up a
guild page that is separate from the guild stuff, but I don't want to
duplicate my work.

   So... whaddya think?
      

Annie <--- Knows she crazy for thinking of taking on a project like
this.
