You missed the Sledgehammer Mallet. 

Procs a gate to the overthere, which gets you a couple hundred feet from 
a pok book no less. all/all. If you can't rely on procing on the mobs 
before you die, you can duel to use it.

Its either very trivial to get (hand a jade to an npc), tedious to get 
(faction first), or virtually impossible to get (faction to low to 
perform the faction quest) so now you need puppet strings or something.

You need amiable faction in the OT outpost to get the hammer. 

The other big deal is the new Origin AA. (Does that render the pottery 
deals for clr/shm obsolete?)
