I installed EQ for the first time tonight.

During the tutorial I get a lot of background sounds from the game,
footsteps, birds singing etc.  however in game I get little or no sound,
aside from the occasional scream when being attacked and the cheezy midi
music.  Is there any way to restore the ingame sounds to the tutorial
levels?  I've checked my options and everything appears to be set fine.

Thanks,

Simon
