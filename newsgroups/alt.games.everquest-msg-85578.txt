    You also have to factor in for how long you want to be selling. If I'm
going to be in EC a while selling stuff anyways, I take a much longer look
at what's being offered in trade and try to evaluate what I can
realistically get for it. Also, try to know if an item has a significant
vendor value. Someone may throw in a Yak to a trade, valuing it at 100 pp
and not knowing that Shady will pay over 200 pp for it. Those vendable items
give you a better "floor" value when figuring out what the worst you could
do on the trade is.
