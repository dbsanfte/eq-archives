yeah... I thought about that for a sec, as well...

I seem to remember SX was only introduced for 486 and late model 386

...and 8Meg in a 286? Surely you could only address the first 640k on a
286... with a software cludge bringing it up to the first 1024k (XMS
memory)... EMS addressing was only on 386 and higher.

Of course this was all 12-14 years ago... I could be wrong
