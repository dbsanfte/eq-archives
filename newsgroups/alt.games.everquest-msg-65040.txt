I thought I could help you out before some jackass flames you over asking a
simple question, but I'm obviously too late.

You are most likely running win98 without having installed DirectX 8.1 which
is a requirement for Win98 with EQ.
Just download it from micro$ofts website, run EQ and you should be fine.
You MAY have to reinstall video drivers.  The EQ tech support states this,
but I didn't have to do so myself, nor have I ever had to reinstall any kind
of driver from simply upgrading DirectX

Good luck!
