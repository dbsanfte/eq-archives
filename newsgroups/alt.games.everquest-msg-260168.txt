We pulled both at the same time, offtanked Ixt Hsek, killed the champion,
and then switched to her.

I don't recall if they werent splittable back when, or we just didnt think
of it (6th guild in txevu i think, so decent probability it changed to be
splittable).. we definately did it the hard way though! (with a raid of 45
may i add !)

Id say its an exploit for the same reason Vulak was an exploit.  People took
advantage of the fact he only did a single "call to arms" to pre trigger it,
then lose the agro on them/move him.. and get to clear Vulak without killing
the required pre-lords and ladies.  Sony also said Vulak was an exploit.
The fact he only did his call to arms once and didnt spam it repeatedly (ala
tunare or CT) well i dunno why they didnt just make that change, instead of
the dumb ring.

In saying that.. I can think of at least 1 change the encounter went through
anyway.
