I'd like to post a few things I have found out so far on Sanctus Seru
and see if anyone else has any information they can add. No LOCs yet,
coming soon.

(Note: This is a quick draft, will fix it up later.)

The mobs in Sanctus Seru range from level 37 to 60. Most guards being
about level 50-54. This should make it a good place to hunt up to
level 65. Particularly solo or with a small group.

It's good for soloing and small groups for several reasons: Single
Pulls, No Adds, and many safe spots to rest.

The mob's agro range seems to be relitively small. I have had luck in
pulling single the two guards that watch the inside gate area where
you leave the city. (This may be due to the fact that I am not KoS to
them yet. But if they are social, they should attack even if they
aren't KoS right?) The two guards are fairly close to each other and
would definetly have both agroed if it were a LDoN, but here the other
one just looks blissfully out into space.

There are several places you can fight without adds, even as the mobs
run away. The one I'm trying is between the first and second butress
on the right (east) as you enter the city. You are behind a tavern and
as you kill the mobs they will run towards the tavern, then walk
either right or left allong the wall. You can usually kill them before
they get too far even without snare. Have not agroed anything inside
the tavern yet while they move along the wall. May be because I'm not
KoS yet, may be because we are outside of the agro range.

No mobs path near except a half elf with a gnarled stalf, she paths
near the west side of the tavern, and only comes by about once per
half hour.

You can generally leave your characters unattended near the second
butress, as no mobs path to within 100 feet of you there. (Except the
mobs above you in the observation deck. However they are also out of
agro range even when sitting. Again I assume because I'm not KoS to
some of the things there yet.)

The lag in the zone is annoying, but only seems to come up about 1
time per fight and only lasts 4 to 10 seconds. You can take that time
to re-position yourself.

Some mobs above level 50 will summon.

Loot is good. The guards on the inside of the gate that I have been
fighting drop 17+pp each time. Also drop FS Weapons and Ringmail. Drop
NO RENT spears, shields, and swords too. Good to give to pets
(particularly as you will have to invis to get in after a while) but
apparently have no other use.
