"Windows ME" + "problem"  = redundant

Go to www.mlin.net and download a little program called STARTUP CONTROL
PANEL.  This kid's a genius.  It simply let's you decide what is allowed to
run in your Startup Folder, and the several other spots that Windows likes
to put startup programs.  Look for one that starts from the Windows or
System folder that sounds like it might be a reminder program (ie winrem.exe
or TutRem.exe).  I'd recommend the Disable option to experiment with - when
you've nailed the culprit then go back and use the Delete.
