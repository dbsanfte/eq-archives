The reason these are "hell" levels is not that you die a lot, or that mobs
suddenly stop giving good exp.

Rather, its due to a quirk of the exp to level calculation.

You'll have noticed that exp to level has been gradually increasing.  This
means that (numbers made up, too lazy to go to the page that gives real ones)
while you might have leveled by killing ten level one mobs at level one, it
took eleven level two mobs at level two, and twelve level three mobs at
level three...

Well, this exp to level curve is fairly smooth up till you hit level thirty, at
which point you suddenly require twice as much exp as you might have
expected to hit 31.  Then the curve settles back down, it actually takes
less exp to go from 31 to 32 than it did to go from 30 to 31.

Up till 50, you see this repeat, a normal gradually increasing curve with
spikes every fifth level of double proportion.  From 50, every level
is on that steeper curve, as though they were all "hell"... but 51, 54, and 59
are twice again -that- outlandish.

A side effect of this:  While in a "hell" level, a death seems to cost half
the exp loss.  Actually it costs the normal amount, but your exp bar
represents a double portion, so the loss is only half its normal size in
appearance.

A side effect to the side effect: If you die in the level immediately after
a "hell" you will appear to lose twice as much exp as usual.  Again,
its the usual amount, but that amount is very large proportional to your
current exp total

In both cases, the phenomenum is really an illusion.
