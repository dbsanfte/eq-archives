I've been mucking around with all the tradeskills, but I notice that
cooking is by far the most annoying.

It's just one long series of failures. When you get a new level of
items you can make the failure rate would have to have to be 8 out of
10. Your lucky to even be able to get the first bar done. Many times
i've seen an item fail completely and there items that I got two
levels ago still have never been able to be made "pristine".

Two things i've noticed:

My tradeskill spells for cooking are all red, even the starter ones,
and I am a level 19 provisioner.

My artistry skill is only 55/90. Why is it so low when all I do with
this guy is cook ?

Cheers,
