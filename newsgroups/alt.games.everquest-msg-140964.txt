He used it when they pulled the other mobs from the house and someone

Nah, they were *told* to just LoH.  A couple of the group suggested the 
group leader say something, but he's a bit shy and just let it go.

Well I was watching the screen.  They pulled the general, the general 
smacked the first tank down in about 5 seconds flat, and moved on to the 
second tank, got him down quick, BIL LoH, got summoned, died.  Maybe the 
tanks weren't high enough/well equipped enough?  It was a *seriously* 
quick wipe-out.
