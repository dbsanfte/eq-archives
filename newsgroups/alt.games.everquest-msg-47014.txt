If this warrior is designed to be a team player and group and scrape his
way to 40 or 50 or 60 then getting AGI up is important.  If this warrior
is going to be PLed to 60 to be a guild tank, then by all means put the
points into STA.  I read the question as "I'm starting a non-twink
warrior who will be an ogre"  where should I put my points.  The answer
to that is 5 to dex and 20 to AGI.  

If the question was "I'm twinking up a warrior, how should I allocate my
points" then the answer would be 5 to dex and 20 into STA.
