The general rule is that if the NPC gives you the text
describing what you need to do for the quest, you have good
enough faction to complete the quest.  They won't tell
you to do the quest unless they already like you well enough.

There are some complications, however:

1.  A few quests are screwed up, and the NPC will give
you the text while your faction is still too bad to actually
complete it.  Thankfully there are very few of these.

2.  Sometimes the NPC giving you the quest will be on a
different faction group then the NPC you need to finish the
quest with.  In cases like this, you'll need to pay attention
to what the first NPC says, because he'll give you directions
which ensure that you "test" your faction with the other
NPC first (such as, "go talk to Fred Flintstone in Bedrock
City and tell him I sent you").  Telling Fred that so-and-so
sent you is what ensures that your faction with Fred is
good enough, because he'll either respond telling you about
the next stage of the quest, or he'll tell you to buzz off
which is a signal to improve your faction standing with
him more before you try again.

3.  If you're not careful, it's possible to have good
enough faction to get the quest text, and then later do
something which lowers your faction far enough that by
the time you go to do the quest turn-in, they don't
like you any more.

4.  With players learning about quests via "spoiler sites",
you'll often learn about the final turn-in, but have no
clue what the earlier stages were which led up to the
finale, and thus will have skipped the earlier stages of
the quest and have no hint whether your faction is
good enough or not for the turn-in.  If you had done
the quest "naturally" by following clues in-game, you
wouldn't have even gotten to the final stage without
having already passed the "faction test".

I can understand that, the Aegis of Life quest components
are a bear to get.  Here's how to verify your faction level:
Talk to Camlend Serbold in the "UFO" in North Qeynos, and say
to him, "Who is Lord Grimrot?"

He should respond:

Camlend Serbold says 'You have heard of Lord Grimrot?
He is a shadowknight working with the Bloodsabers.  We have 
word he is trying to build an army of undead.  Only a 
powerful knight can rid the lands of Grimrot.  So, did 
you come here to [defend life]?

You then say: "I came to defend life"
(Note:  "I come to defend life" won't work, has to
be "came".)  He should then say:

Camlend Serbold says 'Then go to the Plains of Karana.  
Somewhere there, Lord Grimrot is hatching his little 
plan for the Bloodsabers.  Bring me his evil scythe 
and his heart.  It is said that upon his death, his
soul will be absorbed into this weapon of darkness.  
Do this and be rewarded.

If he says this, you're good for the quest
turn-in.

Oh, and the Aegis of Life is technically a
shield, not a cloak, but since you can equip it
in the back slot as well as the offhand slot,
it can be considered a "cloak", and a very nice
one at that.  You seem to be a Paladin -- you
might also want to do the Shield of the Silent
Watch quest, which gives an AC10, WIS+10 shield
that can also be equipped in either slot.  With one
in the back slot and one held as a shield, you'll
have AC+22, and WIS+20, very nice.

As for the Long Sword of Ethereal Energy, you're
good to go if you have Indifferent faction standing
with Yurddle the Caretaker.  But just to be sure,
go through the conversation and hail him, and
do the "what grave robbers?" and "what lists of
belongings", and if he doesn't tell you to get lost,
you should be fine.


>    Can you assume that if NPC gives you quest you have adequate faction
>(assuming the same NPC will be given quest items).

Usually, but see above.


>       Or Is it trial and error. You have to learn from others failures.

Only if the quest is broken, or if you try to jump into a quest
in the middle by following a "spoiler" website.  I know of
countless Paladins who screwed up their final Soulfire quest
turn-in to Brother Hayle because they just read a list of
"give what to whom", and didn't bother actually doing the
quest conversations which would have alerted them that they
still had some faction work to do.

>i.e. indifferent?  Amiable?

No, it varies from quest to quest.  Some quests can be
done while you're deeply Dubious, others have to have Allied
faction standing.
