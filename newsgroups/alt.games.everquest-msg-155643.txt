}them back? And why do they still leave them for use to use again?

Some folks may have trained those skills specifically because they were 
very useful for summoning a ton of mod rods.  Given the change to mod 
rods, they're giving you a chance to re-think and put the points somewhere 
else if you want.

It's also part of their evil conspiracy to screw anyone with those skills 
who doesn't log in between now and PoP release that gets pushed over 30 
AA's.
