I am not up on ranger gear.  I have never played one.  I would suggest you
swapping the wurmslayer and centi.  I would us the Centi as the primary and
Wurmmy as a secondary.  Try a few fights and you may see that your damage
output increases.  The reason is that the Centi is faster than the wurm.
Also, the Wurm is a heavy weapon.  It weighs 15 compared to 6.5 for the
centi.  Using the Wurm as a primary will use your endurance up quicker than
using the centi as primary.
