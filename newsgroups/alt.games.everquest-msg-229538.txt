I disagree. I can't see them going out of their way to establish a forum 
just for people to bash them. The purpose of that chatroom, and the one 
it serves whenever the brainless masses allow it to do so, is to 
disseminate helpful game advice or information to those in need. Why the 
heck would guides and GM's need to be there otherwise? Masochistic 
tendencies?
