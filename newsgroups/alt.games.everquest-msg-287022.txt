Groans of dismay you mean?  Yeah, if this is like the other revamps, no 
new mobs will be added, just the map and look will change... and it will 
become another lag fest to cross on those occaisions when I have to.

Being as my main and my new alt/bot are both gnomes, Return Home will 
mean crossing Steamfont, as will any use of a Faithstone if I get one 
for my cleric (Depends, I suppose, just how bad Steamfont becomes)

All to put a new face on a zone which practically nobody actually hunts 
in anymore.  Woohoo.

THis is exciting.  Ok, its a little exciting if its the same old one 
from last year, its more so if its really new.  Its likely that there 
won't be any rewards worth having for a 70 Time flagged toon, but its 
just fun to see what they do, and something different.

Mistmoore is a great zone, although I question level 20 for it... that 
said, a zone thats good from what, 20 to 40?  Nice.
> Level 25 The Permafrost Caverns
Never really liked the place much, although it is interesting, just 
tends to engender runners that go around corners before you can cast to 
stop them.
> Level 30 Trakanon's Teeth
Again, is this level range right?  Too many roamers, too far apart, you 
spend forever looking for mobs or else you end up buried 6 deep in them 
if you try fighting them where you run into them.  Unless perhaps the 
undead around the hand in area for the Seb key?
> Level 35 The Warsliks Woods
This was always a lag fest of a zone for me, looked like an interesting 
one but I couldn't really have any fun there.
> Level 40 The Dawnshroud Peaks
A classic leveling zone to begin with, Hot Zoning it just adds to the fun
> Level 45 Velketor's Labyrinth
Ah good times, I spent many a day leveling up in Velks... but the exp 
suffered compared to other zones post SOV.  Good to see this regaining 
utility as an exp zone.
> Level 50 The Deep
Scary, but I learned to love it as an SK.  Without FD though, could be 
annoying.
> Level 55 The Temple of Droga
Um, wasn't this just on the list?  Or do I have it mixed up with some 
other out of the way zone everyone just skipped?
> Level 60 Nobles' Causeway
Hey, nice, I'm still doing some factioning in OOW and my cleric's 
starting to not get so much exp in DS.
> Level 65 The Halls of Honor
A POP zone, really?  Sweet.

I like most of these zones because they are easy to get to, short run 
from POK and no major hassles between you and them.  Scarlet Desert, DN, 
what were they thinking?

I also appreciate ANY new hot zones because that means new augments, new 
hot zone loots, and still leaves all the old ones standing.
