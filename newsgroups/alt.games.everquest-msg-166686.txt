Again, none of this is applicable to any government in history, let
alone a feudal government.  Kings do not, cannont, decree that silks
will only be found a certain number of spiders.  Nor can they declare
which cats will have quality pelts.  Though this drop rate is
controlled it must be thought of as a divine control, not
governmental.

No king has the power to undo creation/discovery.  Once created a king
can destroy the items, but the cat is out of the bag.  More will be
created no matter what the decree is.  And as for discovery, no
government has ever been able to keep that in check.

SoE is in complete control, but they can't be considered a government.
No government has "complete" control over squat.  Not the people, not
the currency, not the trade.  It can have laws/rules but they are
always broken and circumventable.  Not so in EQ.  If SoE decides
something will no longer exist, they can make that happen and nothing
can prevent it (RL capitalism not withstanding).  SoE can truly undo
creation and discovery in Norrath.

In a feudal system, the serfs didn't have a choice as to their
servitude.  Every player in Norrath has a choice regarding membership
in a guild.  Take note of the word "membership".  You won't find a
single reference to that word in regard to feudalism.
