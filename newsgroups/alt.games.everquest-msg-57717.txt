There are some EQ server projects out there, but they're never going to
compete with Verant, it's just too expensive.  Even if you ignore
bandwidth, EQ eats quite a lot of computer power, you can't run more than 2
or 3 zones on any one machine (and that's only if the zones are completely
empty, Ill Omen on a production server is probably 3 machines all on its
own), so it takes in the neighborhood of 80 computers to run a complete EQ 
world.
