You are correct when you say "competent" and not "good". This is all pretty
vanilla stuff to crack the Verant egg, so to speak.  I genuinely wonder if
maybe Verant doesn't have the right idea--make it so you need a coat-hanger (or
better) to get in and leave it at that. It stops 99.9% of the population and
the remaining .1% you simply can't stop without making the login process
impossible. When someone does lose their account, from a business standpoint,
it is a minuscule loss compared to the cost of trying to have protected them.

The law of diminishing returns kicks in fast and steep for hacker protection
with something like this.





================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
