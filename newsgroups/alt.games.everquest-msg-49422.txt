Yes, I have taken several weeks to a couple months off at a time.

Was fine. Coming back after the first long break was nice because
I came back with a new attitude. Rule #1 if you aren't having fun you
are doing it wrong.

The only thing I have given up for EQ has been television. I spend about the
same amount of time playing computer games as I used to watching TV.
I even canceled my sattalite subscriptions since I never watch it any more.
So in effect EQ has saved me money since my service was $90 a month. =)

> I used to enjoy

Most television is useless dreck. Only thing I miss is the discovery channel,
But I read science magazines instead now.
