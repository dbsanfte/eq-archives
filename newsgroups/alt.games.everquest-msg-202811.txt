I think you miscounted. Figuring by the number of people posting on each
side, you're a member of a decided minority. There are others on your side.
But not many.

It's pretty straightforward really.

OK, ways that the wide availability of KEI adversely affects the game.

1. KEI-powered low level characters stealing camps that can easily sustain
   a group. This one has been mentioned before. Your response was basically,
   move somewhere else. Well, the KEIer could do the same thing... but
   doesn't. Now, camp stealing isn't restricted to people using KEI, but
   the overpowering advantages give makes it much easier for someone to do
so.
   In any case, denying that this sort of thing does not "adversely affect"
   the game is whistling in the dark.

2. The KEI group. All the casters have KEI. New member? Sorry, can't join,
   you don't have KEI, go get it and come back. Your KEI ran out? Better
   go get a new one. Chanter? Well, chanters do crowd control and mana,
   right? We don't need crowd control; our tank has Virtue. We don't need
   Clarity, our casters have KEI. Cleric? Don't need you, our shaman/druid
   is healing fine and adding lots more DPS than you ever can. The rogue
   and monk don't worry about pulling aggro because first, they have Virtue
   and so can take a pounding and second, every healer they've had to deal
   with has been overflowing with mana from KEI.

3. The caster who has been raised on KEI. Wizards who overnuke. Druids who
   drop large DOTs on inc. Paladins who need med breaks even *with* a C3.
   Clerics who heal early, or nuke or melee then need a med break.

Now, I don't deny that playing *with* KEI as a low-level caster can be
nice (although to be honest I've never had it cast on a character too low
for it). But it's a cheat. Literally. It's like playing in god mode in
a FPS. The designers didn't design the game around it. The game is not
intended to have this happen. They have, after a long time, finally
gotten around to *fixing* a widely exploited *bug*.

If they set up a server where the group casting had not been done, so that
all those who couldn't live without it could move over, I would welcome
that. But the KEI junkies have been ruining the game of the rest of us
for far too long.

        ...Ronny
