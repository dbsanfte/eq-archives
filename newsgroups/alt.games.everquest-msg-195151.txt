Lot's of good replies already here. Just a few notes extra:

AC buffs tend to help alot if they get you over a big number - moving your
AC from 95 to 105 makes a huge difference. Opinion is divided over how much
getting over a 50 mark makes.

Make sure you tank enough to keep your defense skills maxxed. It's too easy
to group all the time or root/rot and forget this. Max defense for shammies
is 5*level (I think), to a cap of 200 at 40.

Rooting gets more effective as noted, but better is the fact that it costs
comparitively less and less to cast. You get into the habit of rooting
something, moving to maximum casting distance and casting your dot, allowing
you to root again if it breaks it - no big deal.

I didn't bother much with slow at lower levels.

Jarcrap - run yourself to Karnors at busy times and shout that you're
looking to loot it as soon as possible.

Your healing prowess will drop off till the point it's actually embarassing
to try to heal a (non twinked) warrior and seeing their health hardly move.
The only way you can be a main healer later on is to regen the tank and slow
everything.

Root parking is your friend. I think it's easier as a shaman than a cleric
as slowing something normally gets it's attention if it's not being beat on.

Monks are superb partners for duoing with a shaman at lower levels - much
better than a warrior as you don't have to heal as much.

As soon as you get cannabalise set up a button to canni-dance. You sit to
catch the med tick, stand up, cast canni, sit down again for the next tick.
Works wonders with regen.

Something to throw into the argument if you're still thinking of switching
to inny troll - they can also use the JBB - 263 direct damage free clicky
nuke, useable at level 45 - which Iksars can't.

Summon your food and drink! It keeps your skills up for when you get your
pet.

For the few levels charm animal is good at, the Kedge Keep entrance is
superb! Cat's or rhinos in OT are good too.
