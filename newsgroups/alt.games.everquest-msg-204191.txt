I agree that some limits would need to be put into place.

A maximum of N items flagged as "for sale" per account seems
like a good start.

Trader NPC's could also charge transaction fees up front.
For example selling your rusty sword for 9,000,000 pp could
mean you have to come up with the 10% transaction fee ahead
of time which would be 900,000 pp.  That would stop some
abuses.
