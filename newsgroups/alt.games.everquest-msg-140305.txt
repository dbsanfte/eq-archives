Heh...someone wanted a named Griff in NK killed the other day.  I
loaded up ensnare, stinging swarm, immolate, and ensnaring roots ( in
case things, for some bizarre reason, went very bad) and proceeded to
track down this gimp griffon.  Hmmm, it shows up dark blue on
track...no problem, so did Stormfeather, and he was a joke.  OK, there
he is....hmmm...ensnare didn't stick.  OK, fluke try again.  Uh
oh...snare isn't sticking, and he's pounding me like a government
mule.  OK, good thing I've got that root up.  Ummm...root won't stick.
RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY!!  OK boys and girls, I can't remember the name
exactly, but movement altering spells will NOT work on the Silver
Griffon ( I think that was the name ).  Not all griffons are created
equal.
