Do you want Halfling meat or will Halfling parts do? The Halfling parts icon
is the same as a chunk of meat of drops off of carrion spiders in EK at
least 50% of the time. Very easy kill for levels 15 and up. Can occasionally
find them for sale at the various merchants in that zone. They are often
left to rot on corpses by silk hunters in that zone.
