There is no way (that I know of anyhow) to list the active channels,
but once you know the name of one, you join it by typing /join 
followed by the name of the channel. If you want to see how it
works try "/join market". This is probably the most active channel
and, as the name implies, is for buying and selling. You may start
a new channel simply by /joining it.

When you join channels the EQ client assigns sequential numbers 
to them beginning with 1. To speak to the channel, type /# (where
# is the channel number) followed by your message. Note: chitchat
in the market channel is frowned upon so you should only speak up
on topic in that one.

The fact that languages have no effect in chat channels is seen
by many on Firiona Vie to be a bug, and some avid roleplayers
refuse to use them for that reason.

Can't help there, I never changed my alignment from the default.

http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie/ is quite active.

On the board referenced above is a list of guild ezboards.
Also www.firionavie.org has a guild listing with general
information and links for each.
