Aye, when I ldon im ml about 50% of the time and only had one cleric want
reimbursement for peridots, caught me as a little odd, being my first time
to see such a thing. but I didnt see a problem with it and neither did

them about it over /ooc, that makes you an idiot too, and you probably ended
up on alot of peoples ignore lists for it, I know you woulda been added to
