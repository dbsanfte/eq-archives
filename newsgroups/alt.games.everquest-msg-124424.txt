    What faction are you folks on? When we do Tormax, well, here's a
cleric's view of it: I sit at WL zone. Two monks run into Kael. Eventually
one comes back with Tormax solo. I think we might kill some lesser giants,
but not many - those are usually XP pulls while we wait on people to arrive.

    You'll hate me for this, but I can't say. =/ And I can't even say why I
can't say. If things change, I'll be sure to tell you. But for now, sadly my
lips are sealed by guild decree.

    He was when the next guild arrived for their turn at the rotation. And
that next guild was, wait for it, Wraith. =) They eventually separated them
enough AND managed to defeat one, but it took them forever to do.

    When Wraith was first knocking at the doors to NToV, the first guild
they tried to beat there was us. They got to Aaryonar, then wiped
completely. We cleared to Aary for them, then told them they were to collect
their corpses and leave - the only reason they weren't summoning bodies from
zone-in was us. They trained us a few times as thanks, then their
guildleader told our guildleader "As soon as you kill Aaryonar, we're going
into NToV with you. We'll let you pick which way you want to go, though."

    So we left.

    After an hour, they realized they were hosed and also left. We came back
the next day and cleared as usual. Aaryonar is our friend!

    We've had non-standard tanks in NToV for giggles. I forget which dragon
it was, but we had a ranger tank one of the nameds. =)
