Having just hit 29 and feeling rather broke (cost over 200pp to get my
spells) my little assling Druid decided it was time to kill some Giants.

I struck lucky and caught a free MGB Kei as I dropped a friend at the nexus
then realised I had run out of cash to get ensnare (Big mistake).
I took 3 HG (one after another not all at the same time) before one resisted
once too often and I bit the dust, anyone wanting to do the same thing
(maybe without the dying bit) I would advise to do the following ...

1) Dont even try it without Ensnare !

2) Unless you have 200 plus wisdom get a KEI it will pay for itself.

3) At 29 your best bet is wolf yourself, snare HG, run like the clappers,
Dot, run some more, second Dot, start again.

4) Keep your best HP buff up if you get pounded on you will need it, also
put on your self DS it adds AC.

Its also worth noting that at 29 the Giant skellies and Clops are equal exp
and drop loads faster.
