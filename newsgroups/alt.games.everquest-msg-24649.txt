As I sit here waiting to login, I get to thinking about the splash screen.
The one right before you enter Norrath.
It is the one with all the little pictures around the edges. You can see a
Troll in about the 4 o'clock position. You can see some ice mountains in
about the 2 o'clock position.
What is the thing in the 11 o'clock position? It looks like something
breathing fire. Anyone know what it is?

Just wondering.
