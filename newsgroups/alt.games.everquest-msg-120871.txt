Either the effects or the display strings on the items are bugged.

Last night my "Range Enhancement III" Cougar Claws never fired off
until I accidentally cast a L39 buff at an NPC (from an item even,
I had thought they only worked on spells you cast yourself).  L49,
L50, and L9 offensive spells got no reaction.  If what you're quoting
from Graffe's is correct then the actual effect on the Cougar Claws
is a "II" and not a "III".
