Great spell for soloing the skellies in Steamfont.  I never played with the
ones by the Mino Caves, but I did do the ones at the Dragon Bones for a
while.  Bone chip heaven.

Amen.

I killed so many Orcs in GFay that the sisters consider me an Ally, even as
I took them down for the halberds for my pet.  I'd sell the belts to the
merchant in the building near the dock.

I followed "necro.eqclasses.com" advice and killed Fallen Iksars in Tim Deep
at this time, I think.  Loot was important at the time and I think it was
marked as good EXP, decent loot.  When you take the barge to Tim Deep, head
SE and swim to the island with the Fallen Iksars and the Bandits.  Boring
solo work, but never any competition.  They don't drop bone chips, though,
if I remember correctly, and run when they are about to die - towards the
water.

After that, I went to Garg / Spec Isle.  Good loot ( garg eyes ) and endless
supply of Halberds ( sisters ) for the pet.  A Chanter and Druid even killed
the Oracle for me and let me loot the robe in my long stay there.  Gargs are
borderline scary at first, but when they all start conning white and then
blue, it's cake.  You can even get the Pally Harpoon on that island by
getting the lady to spawn Xyrin and give it to low level Pallys.  I hardly
ever had any competition for the Gargs, except a bard once.  Sometimes
Druids will want to kite the specs, but in my experience, they will stay
away from you if you let them know you are there.

If you go there, there are 2 things on the Gargs' spawn table -> Gargs and
Greater (?) Skellies.  They alternate spawns, and they fight each other,
with the Gargs winning.  If you are the only one there, when the skellies
spawn, a Garg will take care of it because you won't be killing Gargs fast
enough to spawn too many skellies.  If there are 2 of you there, you will
need to kill the skellies to speed up the Garg spawns.

Gargs hit hard, and are 100% resistant ( from what I saw ) to one of my
spells, I think it was Fear.  They also aggro on you the second you drop
your second spell on them.  So, if you pull one with Engulf, if you drop
another DoT, it will ignore the pet and come for you.  I think I pulled with
a better Dot sometimes, and then engulfed near the end.

Once in a while, a Seafury will get on your island and not want to leave.  I
asked some of the high-level campers to come kill it if they had time when
that happened.

I had a lot of fun in that zone, bantering in OOC with the others.  Met some
nice people there.
