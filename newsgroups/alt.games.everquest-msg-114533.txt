I am trying to multitask my drinking-habit into my grinding, i have no time
for only drinking :)
But definately it is alot of fun listening to drunks.. one should get a
language modifier though depending on
ones own lvl of drunken stupor.. i mean drunk people tend to understand one
another very well
even if nothing any of thgem says makes any kind of sense.
