For the record: I have increase my research skill to 175 at the Firiona Vie
Magician trainer. I probably have this even logged.

I didn't went beyond that because I made level 51 before I could research
the lvl 49 pets and I don't have any need for research anymore. I don't know
if this is because of my class or of the trainer, but I made 175 by training
points alone.
