This is one of the spots where EQ had a chance to be great and fumbled
it.  I *really* wish there were certain things you *had* to do as a
cleric / druid / necro / shaman / paladin / shadowknight / beastlord
and other things that you *couldn't* do.  And if you crossed the line
you lost all your power (if paladin / shadowknight) or half your power
(if one of the others).  And if you crossed a second line you lost it
permanently.
