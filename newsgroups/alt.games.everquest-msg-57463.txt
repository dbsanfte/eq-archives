Hi all...

Maybe someone can throw me a rope here.  I installed EQu, and as advertised,
my logon was a heck of a lot quicker - however, much to my dismay, my ping
(nominally anywhere from 70-160 on my cable modem) jumped up, maxing out at
510!  This was after I cranked the slider all the way to the right.

It got "better" once I turned it back down to the original setting, but got
"better" in the sense that it was between 150-300 :-(

Now, even though I don't launch EQu, the Ping is still pretty lousy.  Any
help, anyone?
