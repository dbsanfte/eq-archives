I was trying to show this guy how to make a hotkey to cast spells once.
The string should have been /pause 4,/cast 3 (or something like that).
The poor guy could not make it work despite me typing in the EXACT 
string he needed to put in the hotkey. We eventually found out he was
not seeing the "/"s and ","s in the line. all he was seeing was:
"pause 4  cast 3"  when I sent it to him.
 
 I've noticed other things some people don't see too. I seem to see all
of what I'm supposed to I think, but I know for certain others don't 
see a lot of certain characters for some reason.
 
 Something is very fishy here....
