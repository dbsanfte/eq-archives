Well, as I also mentioned in my post, I wanted to know what Verant's policy
on this was. Yes, I was certainly wrong to have acted that way and to have
used bad language. I don't normally resort to those things unless I hit my
finger with a hammer by accident. And I apologized. As I also said, I called
Verant up and told THEM I'd apologized. I'm certain that I'm not the first
to have slipped up ingame.
