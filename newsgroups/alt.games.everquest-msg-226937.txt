That's the kicker. Luckiness *is* a measurable trait (ability isn't the 
right word) and its measurement by definition is assigned to each person 
so it definately has to do with 'you' in particular.

However I do get what you are saying too.

Larry Niven's Ringworld, for example, went the other way with it, and 
suggested that luck is attached to particular people in some way, 
instead of it being 'it was going to happen that way this time 
irrespective of who did the test'... that the person performing the 
'random' is directly and personally involved in the result.

This isn't entirely unsupportable, we already have the uncertainty 
principle which notes that obervation affects the experiment, and we 
have the theory around Schrodinger's Cat which requires an observer to 
open the box before the cat is alive or dead... if the observer is so 
integral a part of the trials... it is not so unlikely the the 
particular observer would affect the trial differently. Perhaps causing 
a few extra heads or a few extra tails depending on whos doing the calling.

To an extent it is a completely unprovable hypothesis. Much like free 
will vs. predestiny.
