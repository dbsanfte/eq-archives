Hi folks,

Trying to improve my tailoring for the 5th Prayer Shawl quest.

What's the best way to get Silks/Pelts etc? I farmed the spiderlings in
Nektulous for an hour, the drop rate was abysmal (1 in 4 had any silks). I
killed animals in WC and EC and got a few ruined pelts, but I'm at 29 now
and need some MQs.

Thought I was really lucky and bought a stack of Ruined Lion Skins in EK
from a vendor - are these good for anything? Couldn't get them to combine...

So, any tips on MoBs with a better drop rate, or other ways to go from 29 to
130 in Tailoring would be very helpful. Looks like Cured silk is the way to
go, but the Spiderling Silk seems to be tough to get.

BTW I looked at EQTraders and Lokari's site but found no info on 'best
hunting practices'. Maybe I didn't look hard enough so if the info is there
please LMK.
