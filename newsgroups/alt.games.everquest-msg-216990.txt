If this is true ( and I have no reason to doubt it ) then you sir dont know
how to play our class. Single pulling is a trivial task with Harmony of
nature. The pathing on either of the Raptor islands is very easy to
determine after very little observation. Pulling a single to the shore to
root/rot is a trivial taks, and even of you insists on single kiting these
it STILL can be done with very little effort. Quad kiting them is even
easier since rounding up the quad will by its nature clear your kiting area
out for you.  I spent MANY levels there quadding, and never once came CLOSE
to dieing, not even when I got the named raptor in a quad.
