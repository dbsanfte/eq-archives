The problem is you have a lot of people who can't find groups and
everyone else vying for the same few camp spots. The game design is
suppose to prevent that--not some written/unwritten "code of conduct".

And really how much fun are you having if you spend half your time LFG
and the other other half competing with other parties. Maybe check out
Dark Age of Camelot in October. It's suppose to have design features
to address a lot of the things that are problems in EQ.
