Excellent. 2.3 ghz w 1 gig of memory. Geforce4TI 4600. I'm going through a
router. Tech said that might be the problem, although my wife and I have
been using the same setup for over a year and haven't had a problem.  (We
both play and each have our own accounts) One oddity is that we I do an
ipconfig on both computers hers just list the local address while mine lists
both a local and a 'real' ip address.  Ah, the mysteries of networking...
Might try taking a second character into that zone to see if it crashes,
too.  :-(
