I think that grouping is great if you can get some volume on your
kills and are killing reds. If you are killing blues I think you are
better going on your own. I have some numbers to back this  up and
would like to see some comments.


Lvl 25 Wooly Mammoth = 50000 exp points (aprox)
All group members are same level


I kill it and get 50000 experiance

My and a partner kill it we each get 25500 exp

(50000*2%)+50000=51000/2=25500

A full group of 6 kills mammoth we each get 10000 exp

(50000*20%)+50000=60000/6=10000




Now granted a good group can shread thru some mobs rather quick and
when you solo you have down time to heal and recharge mana but you
need to do the same in a group too


Granted their are other advantages to grouping but for experiance
only , solo is the way to go, even with blues.
