Now that Leo mentioned remapping, i will REALLY reccomend you to remap the attack
button. When you start out, its the A key. Problem is that if you talk to NPCs
(for doing quests for example), its not uncommon that the game do not notice you
pressing Return to start typing. And when you havent noticed, and are typing,
youll most likely end up dead, since pressing A will start attacking the NPC, and
they WILL kill you.
Personally i have remapped my auto attack to CTLR + A. Am used to it now, but if i
started out again i would probably get another key, since CTRL + S make you sit
down, and then mob do ful dmg on you.
