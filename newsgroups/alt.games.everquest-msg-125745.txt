we had an encounter with rage saturday night

3 guilds sat at the spawn spot waiting.. nice bitchy atmosphere in the zone.

I arrived late so missed most of it (thankfully), but when I headed over to
SF and saw which guilds were involved - well one of them was a pretty small
guild (and the cleric in question, I had actually pulled her guilds chardok
raid when she got the piece).

Well I didn't like that.. I knew full well what would happen with rage when
he popped, and that they were totally wasting their time.

I spoke to their guild leader.. told him as a friend, not as "the
competition" or enemy, and simply painted a picture of what would happen
when Rage spawned.. that they really didn't want the headache from it all.

They pulled out (which was the best thing imo).. but still 2 guilds
remained.

It was so stupid.. and what a nice helpful GM - "I don't want anything to do
with this.  Whichever guild gets the exp, gets the cleric epic"   nice to
see GM's give their blessing to ksing.

Anyway the best overall result happened, Rage didn't even fucking spawn that
night.

Somebody remind me again, why my cleric will never get his epic.
