If you want to get technical about it... The bulk of the land was usurped by
the European colonialist powers.  After wars and colonial deals, England had
the bulk of the colonists and said colonists revolted against their distant
rulers (inheriting said land in the process).  Then, through deals and wars,
the new USA acquired the rest of the continental US from other European
powers (namely France, Spain and Russia [in the case of Alaska]).  The only
true imperial move by the us against indigenous peoples was in Hawaii.  We
did, however, lie profusely to the native population of the Americas and
keep moving them from land that they had lived on for centuries before the
European settlers landed.


Well, this thread has been well and truly hijacked...
