My computer can not handle EQ2. Is everyone going to buy a new computer with 
a ton of ram and a humongus graphic's card? I think not at this time. I'm 
sure there are a lot of people in the same boat I am,and I will stick with 
EQ1.

My freinds that have gotten EQ2 have told me that the game looks and sounds 
great, and they have comps that can handle EQ2. But when they get near a 
city the lag is bad, and they have a machine that is supposed to ba able to 
handle it. My take on it is that when the game sells for 29.95 then you will 
see it take off like a rocket! P.S. People are already coming back to EQ1.

I't sounds to me like EQ2 will go through the same bebugging process EQ1 
went through. But will SOE start on EQ3 and not fix all the bugs in EQ2? I 
guess you have to look at the SOE history to answer that.
