Christina Ricci really can be hot, witness Sleepy Hollow. Though
normally she is not.

The fellow you refer to certainly seemed dedicated to it but isn't
among the more skilled. He should have used some of his socks to join
the attack on himself at one point, so they would have greater
credibility later if he used them for other things. Oh, and socks
should be cultivated beforehand, so they have a usenet history. A sock
with no history is dead meat against people who typically check google
when the flags go up (like bizbee for example).

There's a couple more things smart socks should do, but given we have
runaway socks in the newsgroup (and this thread) at the moment I am
not going to divulge more usenet secrets to help them out. They have
to *earn* their way out of sock newbiedom. :-)
