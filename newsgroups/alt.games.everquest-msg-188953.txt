Due to the fact that my GeForce 3 Ti500 is dying (fan isn't spinning anymore
so the card is all nice and toasty) I've decided to buy a new and better
video card.

My question is, which card out there is the best bang for buck?  Looking at
the GeForce 4 with 128MB of Video Memory but also thought I'd ask about the
Radeons that are out there.  What experiences have you all had with the
various Mid-High range cards that are available.

I'd like to spend around $200 or less for whatever I get.  Due to
www.pricewatch.com I can tend to find good deals on things, so I won't be
doing the Best Ripoff (Buy) route of things.
