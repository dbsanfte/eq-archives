    Note level of cleric. Since this is the FV server, I doubt she was
twinked. Meaning she'll fold FAST if she catches aggro. Oh, and you should
be able to figure out the race to within a few choices considering the
grouping restrictions on FV. :-)

    Her health likely dropped quickly, she got in frenzy range, and once
that happened nothing you could do would get them off her. Had she caught
any aggro before this, or were things pretty controlled? And what did you do
to get them off her - standard debuffs, pop HT on them...?

    I still find it hard to believe that the cleric had been healing the way
she had all evening, and you didn't notice / she hadn't been jumped for it.
As for the "we could have killed them easily" part, I've heard people give
speeches like that and they never come out kindly.

    No Disease Cloud? That ATK debuff spell? Most of the time a Shadow
Knight can get aggro whenever they want - was he below two bubs of health
and frenzied?

    Again, no harm touch? Not an accusation, since some SKs just use it as a
part of XP grinding and don't save it for emergencies. I know my SK used to
save it for emergencies.

    That's an unfortunate response to what happened. Even if she felt you
folks messed up, she should have discussed things before you're getting beat
on. I also wonder why two fanatics was supposed to be so easy, and a zealot
and a fanatic were tough enough to kill someone, but I don't remember the
levels of the lizards very well.

    She's a dark race cleric - she'll be fine as long as she doesn't do the
diva thing too much. Healers are always in demand - you folks took one that
was barely high enough to get XP with your group. People also tend to cut a
lower level person a bit more slack than someone higher level, since they
might actually be learning the game as opposed to being clueless.

    Um, it didn't sound from what you described that she tried to get others
killed. I can see how, with the right tone, that it could be taken that way,
but if she just wanted to stay alive she may have been planning to heal
during downtime and not in combat. You'd really have to be there to tell
which it was.

> This girl gave up a very nice exp camp

    I doubt she thought she'd get the boot for not healing during combat,
and may have even figured dying would hit her XP enough that the XP in the
camp wouldn't make up for it.

    I see a lot of qualifiers in that sentence. That makes me wonder even
more if there's a second side here that we haven't heard yet.
