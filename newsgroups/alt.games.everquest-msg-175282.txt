The values I've seen are:

   -2000    scowls threateningly, "KOS", your faction can't get any worse
-1999..-751 scowls threateningly, "KOS"
 -750..-501 glaring threateningly, "KOS" 
 -500..-101 dubious
 -100..0    apprehensive
    0..99   indifferent
  100..499  amiable
  500..749  kindly
  750..1149 warmly
 1150..1999 ally
    2000    ally, your faction can't get any better

Can't find where I got this chart from though. Typically, each time you
see a "Your faction has become better" or "Your faction has become worse"
message, you've gained or lost a single point of faction. For example,
killing goblins, sarnak, and iksar outcasts gives you 1 faction point with
Cabilis Troopers for each kill. Similarly, the kobolds in Warrens give 1
faction point with Heretics for each kill.

Be aware that some creatures and quests will cause you to gain or lose
more than 1 point at a time, but don't give you any special message for
that. Turning in a Kobold Molar to the Heretics is worth about 5 points,
for example, and turning in a Gnoll Fur Cloak to the Halas Rogues is worth
50 points or more. Killing the "good" treants in the Karanas will give you
major faction hits with the Surefall druids and rangers. In my experience,
killing named mobs seems to be worth more than unnamed mobs, but there's
no hard rule for it.


>How many mobs of what lvl would i have to kill get from indifferent to
>amiable?

In my experience, worst case is 100 mobs, and mob level won't make a
specific difference.
