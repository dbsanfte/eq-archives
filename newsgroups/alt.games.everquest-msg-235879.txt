Same place he met the first batch... the internet.

Actually he was quite explicit about it being optional:
"Doing this would be voluntary. If an individual did not want to
participate in this extra childbearing, that would be fine."

Yes it could be. He doesn't give reasons for wanting to select mates.
And your right it, now that I look at it again, it definately looks to
be a breeding agenda of some sort though.

Having said that though, individual freedoms aren't being tampered
with so I'm not sure that its eugenics. Its 'suggested' selective
breeding with freedom to refuse to participate and freedom to select
one's own partners... its not 'controlled' selective breeding. That
waters the eugenics down quite a bit. Perhaps putting it in the same
league as single women profiling sperm donors prior to artificial
insemination, or even perhaps what some of our dating services
currently are doing...

On an unrelated note, it looks like his site has picked up some major
traffic, as he's reduced its size in an effort to keep the bandwidth
down.
