    Take this as an "unsupported anecdote": my buddy did the Avenger Battle
Axe quest a few times. He claims that after you ask Faldor's brother in
Dagnor's Cauldron about him, either Faldor or his beggar PH will spawn 30
minutes later in Qeynos. I'm dubious about "delayed spawn" claims in
general, but he DID get the axe twice.
