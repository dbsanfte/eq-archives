And DAoC players get server status on the front page of the Herald:

    <http://www.camelotherald.com/index.shtml>

and World of Warcraft players get it from a page linked from the front page:

    <http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/realmstatus/compat.html>

The DAoC server status, and online populations, and other stats, are
available in an XML feed from camelotheral.com, so you can even easily write
your own script to monitor the servers, or to graph populations, and stuff
like that.

Hmmm....I wonder.  Didn't Sony make it so that the EQ chat system could be
accessed from outside EQ?  I wonder if there is some way to use that
interface to figure out if a server is up or not.
