I think either a shaman or paladin would work well. Either one can
tank and hold agro while the rogue backstabs. I ran a rogue in a
shaman/rogue duo up to 40th lvl and it worked well, but it wasn't very
efficienent compared to any of the other shaman/melee duos because the
shaman has to melee. Usually, once you pass 30th lvl or so, a shaman
is better off not tanking in anything but a solo or crowd control
situation. 

Never ran a pally/rogue duo but I think it would work pretty well if
you accept the fact that you can't take out any 'big' mobs since you
don't have slow or serious combat heals. 

I'd stay away from any of the fear kiting combos, while it might be
efficient, I found it extremely annoying as the rogue.
