Well you're a *rogue*.  What else would be appropriate?  Hm... speaking 
of, what *are* the classes and levels you've played?  I'm curious as to 
what you've played and enjoyed.  I've tried just about everything and 
although I did *like* quite a few, I didn't out and out have fun with 
them until I tried the rogue and necro.

Wow, that NEVER happens to me.  ::whistles::  Well, okay, maybe 99% of 
the time.  "Hey, what's that over... *SLAP*"   Actually, my poor necro 
is having a HELL of a time of it, and it's not even because she goes 
where she shouldn't.  She lost level 16 three times, and levels 17-19 
once each (well, so far on 19 - I still could, I just re-dinged again 
tonight, and the SWEET thing about necros is it takes what, 4 or 5 mobs 
to reding instead of 40 :p).  Tied for Most Embarassing Deaths were: 
pulling a white dry bones skelly and getting smacked down by a light 
blue madman who popped right on top of me - I unfortunately was just 
starting to recover health from the skelly after dark pacting too long 
without bandages.  A few hits from the madman and the skelly noticed I 
was "nearly dead".  And fixed that.

And then today I was soloing orc 1 pulling in some faction when all of a 
sudden, although nothing light blue or above had attacked me before from 
my medding spot, the ENTIRE FREAKING CAMP jumped on me.  2 high chiefs, 
even.  My pet didn't last long, and my pang of guilt at FDing and 
leaving him to deal with it meant I didn't get FD off in time and died 
too.

Stupid cute pets...
