I doubt it to. But who knows what future technology may hold.

True. But it has always been an asked for feature.
I usually even bind my casters in towns so I can be near
a bank when I die. To get spell components.

They might add a really nasty quest to do it, so people
wouldn't do it at the drop of a hat.

Bah. Hackers can already run EQ in a window anyway.

This would actually let people use their muti-tasking operating
system to *GASP* MULTI-TASK! What a shock!

It always annoyed me that I had a multi-thousand dollar computer
at my finger tips and I had to take notes with a pencil and paper, and
couldn't switch out to browse the web.

That's what was said about many features that have been since added
to the game. Personally I think it would just add a little more conveinence
to the game. They have continually added spells to the game with every
expansion without increasing the spell gems. Some of the lesser used spells
might get used more often. I fail to see how this would be a 'drastic' change.

Arrows and throwing items that stack I think should probably still vanish but
there are a lot of single range items like spears and axes that
NEVER get used by players. They are simply too expensive to throw
just 'once.'

Yep I see people using those to role-play all the time. /em rolls eyes.
Some role-playing things from P&P games should be left in P&P games.
They should just add some quests where NPCs wont talk to you unless
you raise faction AND speak to them in their tongue. Just a reason to
learn the language.

Yeah well I can dream can't I? =)
They might update the servers to Crays some day.

Was'nt planning on it. =)
I'll be anxious to see if any of the next generation of MMOGs
has an Automap.
