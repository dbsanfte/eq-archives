Irrelevant. If they don't think that revamping old zones will help
them increase profit, they won't do it. How much they charge a month
doesn't matter. At some point, they calculated just how much they can
charge to maximize profit and I doubt that revamping zones entered
into that equation. 

For zone revamps to make sense from their perspective, someone would
have to make the decision that they can justify the short term drop in
profits in exchange for long term gains. That isn't gonna happen with
SOE, they've proved over and over with the way they shovel expansions
out the door.
