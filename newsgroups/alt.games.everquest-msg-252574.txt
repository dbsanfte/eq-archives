The answer is dynamic content as you are about to point out, and I
have a huge post waiting to be made about it here and elsewhere, but I
haven't gotten around to typing it yet. But there is an answer to what
you're asking for, no one has done it yet.

It could have been though. Everything necessary to make EQ completely
dynamic was actually in game by Velious - at which point SOE/Verant
had the ability to script large scale events and zones could change
due to player interaction.

But they dropped the ball. Why? We can only guess.

That is being generous; given their claims of marketting to the
"casual player" I'd be better on more like two tops.
