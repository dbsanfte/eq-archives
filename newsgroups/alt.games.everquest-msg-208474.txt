Someone posted what I thought was a reasonable hypothesis: The
preorder code has a bug which makes the server forget that you
have other expansions installed.  And since the server now thinks
you don't have any expansions, it likewise thinks that you have no
AAs and no levels past 50, because those are things that are only
available in expansions.

You just gotta look a little deeper for the connection.
