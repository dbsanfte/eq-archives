I'm glad you found a guild that you can work forward with, its very 
difficult. I think a lot of players find they're either chomping the bit 
of their guild... or getting left behind.  If your an off-peak casual 
player I just don't think its terribly realistic to expect that you'll 
be able to find a suitably large guild with suitable numbers on at your 
playtime to give you much hope of seeing much interesting content past a 
certain point -- especially as a more casual player (including 'a 
previously hardcore player who now has a job/life/baby...')
