I'm still sort of new, so forgive me if this question is really dumb.  I've
read all my manuals and can't find the answer.  I'm a level 11 Warrior, and
I'm feeble at binding wounds.  I've binded my own wounds many many times,
and I don't notice that it's helping me at all.  I get a message that says
I'm binding my wounds, and then one that says I'm through binding my wounds,
but afterwards, I don't see that it's done any good for me.

Is it because I'm feeble at it?  Can someone tell me how binding wounds
works, and how much it's supposed to help my character?

Thanks,

Connie
