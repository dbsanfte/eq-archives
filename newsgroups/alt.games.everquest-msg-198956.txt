Hardly insurmountable, just very difficult.  First off, you could continue 
with just tier 1 planes through 61 easily, and beyond with increasing 
difficulty.  Secondly, you could have paid the right people to take you 
through the trials, or, you could have just kept attempting pickup groups 
until you finally got the right mix.  It does happen, people of most any 
class do manage to make it through eventually, one way or another.
