Time magazine is planning an Everquest article to hit newstands the
week of E3. In preparation for this, I'd appreciate any comments,
thoughts and anecdotes to illustrate the answer to the question: Why
is Everquest so popular? Why is it so addictive (and has anyone else
heard it referred to as "Evercrack"?) Have you lost your life to it,
and when did you first realize that was the case?

E-mail the writer (Chris Taylor) at cdt@well.com, by the end of
Wednesday. Please include your real name, name in the game, age,
occupation and location. Many thanks!
