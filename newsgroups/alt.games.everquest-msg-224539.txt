When I'm training a zone line, I sometimes don't have time to hit Num
Lock and /shout Train to <zone>.  So, if I get to the zone, and I see
people there(either fighting, or recouping from a wipe), I will stop,
turn around, and try to find another way out.  Frequently, this means my
death.  Am I doing "the right thing"?  Is this one of those questions
that can't be answered?  I'm not sure I could stop doing it, even if I
tried.  I would just feel too bad for training people, "Well, they
should have expected it, fighting at a zoneline" reasons regardless.
Besides, I had no time to give a warning.

All in all, I'll be happy to get Death Peace in a few levels. ;/
