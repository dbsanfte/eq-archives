Actuaklly the movie house can stipulate the terms of transfer, and
even prohibit sale of a particular movie from particular vendors, they
make that enforcable by making contracts. Lets say Walmart was going
to sell, "Elves Gone Wild" exclusivly. The houses contract to
distribute it to Walmart, and tell other vendors you can't have it
until these tersm are met.

Sony has made it clear, in game things are not licensed to be sold for
real money. They made that clear in the contract, and as long as that
is enforcable, it actionable in a civil judgement.

Sony can also ask for damages, and those damages can have a punitive
component. A contract is upheld in a court of law. A business that
makes money on this manner can be enjoined, and the assests used to
pay any judgement that the court awards.

Wrong. They have to prove that an intangible reputation was harmed.
This is easy, based on the number of people complaining about people
farming plat for cash fenced by the plat sellers. They can also add
damaged reputation by the casino operator nusiance, and the duping bug
which MANY suspect had been divulged to plat farmers by Yantis.

The can also shut down ISPs who host those people, I find it odd that
they have not done so.
