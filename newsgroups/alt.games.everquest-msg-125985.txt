And some of us chose this path, of our own free will.  Your understanding of
our faith cannot even be considered topical.  Have you actually read the
Book of Mormon, or is your posting a sign of your reveling in your own
ignorance?

Try again.  The witnesses were all men of high standing in the community,
and were not related to the prophet.  But, hey, don't let the truth delude
you.

I'd be even more upset if they didn't perform the ordinances.  Any who are
baptised posthumously are not members of the church.  The ordinance is
performed so that they may have the oppertunity to choose to accept the
word.  Still, it is your choice.
