Problem being there was no reciprocal need for non-casters.  All hybrids and
tanks (and everyone under 12) needed binds, but there was nothing really
that they had to offer that the pure casters and healers would need.  Cash makes

up for this lack to some extent, but lower level characters (principle consumers

of the binds in start cities) don't have enough cash to make higher level ones
drop what they are doing in order to come perform the service unless they
are twinked.

This isn't player interdependance, its setting players of -some- classes to
be leaches.

At higher levels this idea works fine, you'll almost never see a group that
doesn't include at least one caster or healer, so a group can bind -itself- as
a unit just fine, as well as port itself, levitate itself, ressurect
itself...while the
tanks do most of the heavy lifting, bringing in more kills per hour than a
comperable mana based group... except for AOE kiters who seem to me
to break the interdependance mold.
