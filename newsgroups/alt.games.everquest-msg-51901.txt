    I've seen it a few times, insofar as the "this person is a complete
moron". But it can be hard to distinguish soloists and E-bays sometimes, so
you can never tell. The wizard in Seb that flat-out refused to snare,
insisting he could blast the mobs dead as they turned to run, and the druid
that had to sit down, memorize an evac, then sent us to SRo from Seb are two
that stand out in my mind.

    None of my friends have been E-bay'ed, but I have heard horror stories
about people not hearing someone was E-Bay'ed and misplacing their trust.
Even worse is the "community character" - one enchanter on my server,
Panchulan, was at one time played by up to a dozen different people. You
never knew whether you were going to get the original Panchulan (a
superlative ENCH), a passable Panchulan, or you-pull-two-I-gate-la~
Panchulan. The fact that all his players were ESL didn't help matters. But
when you were one of three incomplete groups at zone in Seb, with no
enchanters (or other crowd control specialists like bards) to be found
anywhere, and he zoned in.... You roll the dice, you take your chances.
