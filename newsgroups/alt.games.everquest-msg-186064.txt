The insane XP is the reason everyone is there, but spending 10-24
there means missing places like Befallen, Kurn's, Runnyeye, Upper Guk,
the outside parts of Unrest, Crushbone, the Warrens, and probably some
other places, too. Which I intend not to do with my new froglok, who
fortunately has a group that isn't primarily interested in levelling
rapidly.
