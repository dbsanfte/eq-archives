Ever notice how difficult it can be to get those melee skills up?
Ever notice how easy it is to get those casting skills up?
Point is that casters have an easier time getting skill up in those
things that are used in combat. Casters can stand in some corner in
the nexus with kei and cast some spell a few hundred times and presto
max skill. But for some reason a melee cant do this, they have to find
a mob, blue or higher mob mind you, and TANK about 100 of them to
maybe get 20 points on defensive, a non trainable skill. This is why
many non MT melee/hybred classes lag so far behind in non-trainable
skills. Also from what I've read all skill up are int/wis related, not
the biggest stat for those classes. So caster in nexus, melee in
mortal combat see my point? One is fast and easy the other is brutally
slow.

For what its worth some ideas:

Make all melee skills trainable and allow 10 points per level to train
or do away with points altogether. By far the best solution.

Increase the skill up rate on melee classes.

Allow skill up on any con of mob.

Yeah I know not the hottest topic in EQ but one that remains a
constant PIA.
