Something I'm noticing while adventuring in FoB and the surrounding
area. There seems to be pretty much *only* one hand slashing weapons of
various types that drop from the mobs. My 1HS skill is maxed at level
10, and I managed to pick up a dagger, so piercing is getting up there.
But I also very much want to keep my 2HS and 1HB up as I level, and
that's far easier to do now then fifteen or twenty levels later. 

At least in the Freeport newbie area you can be pretty much assured of
getting a cracked staff and a rusty two handed sword to get all your
skills up. What's up with the only 1HS stuff in FoB? Where can I hunt
down some crap newbie 1HB and 2HS weapons to work on those skills?

Any of you experienced leeezards have any tips?
