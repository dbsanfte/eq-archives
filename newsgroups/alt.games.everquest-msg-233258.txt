OMFG. Eepï¿½. Christ.

I first ran into that particular virus on comp.graphics.apps.alias a few 
years ago, killfiled his ass (he's one of the only two people I've *ever* 
killfiled), and then ran into him again, or rather into the replies to 
his posts on the comp.games.development.* hierarchy (is it here where 
you found him?). It wasn't a pleasant surprise.

Ben is right. Google for his posts, and weep.
