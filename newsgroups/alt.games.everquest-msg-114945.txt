A friend of mine ahs been farming mobs in Grimling Forest for tailoring
purposes,
despite the fact that they are green to him at 54.  At 51 some of these
same
mobs were light blue.  He reports noticing AA progress despite no exp
message,
with his AA set partially on.

He did not notice this in time to test moving it to full and then
verifying actual
movement, but knows about where his AA was after his last exp hunting,
and
again before he next went exp hunting.  No movement of the regular exp
bar but he -thinks- movement on AA bar with AA at 50%.

If this is accurate, his theory is that AA is calculated as if you were
a level 51
killing your target mob; that not only (as people have already noted)
does your
AA bar move at the same rate as it would if you were doing level 51
instead
of say 54 or 59... but that the "con" of the mob is based on that level
51 as well.

This will make a huge difference to him, if true, since as a dedicated
tailor there
are metric bardloads of green to 54 mobs that he is killing on a regular
basis,
and now will be seeing actual progress of a sort; he'll turn that AA bar
up to
100% and work it hard.

Heck, it may make a difference to me as well, I have some friends that
like
to exp at the entrance area of the Hole, which is sadly almost all cyan;
but
firmly blue at 54, perhaps I'll give up the pittance of 58 exp I'm
getting when
I help out there and turn it into a rich AA exp camp.

Can anyone verify this phenomenum?  Anyone want to test it out on their
own?
I'm such a newb I can't even recall what the green/cyan/blue ranges are,
what
level mob would be blue to 51 and green to 58 anyway?
