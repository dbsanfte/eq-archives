Welcome to EQ. Once you have you connection problems sorted out and your
halfling druid generated, I predict you will have no problem fitting in at

Don't forget to use the /shout facility once ingame to tell everyone of your
experiences. Sometimes people are very busy and miss interesting
information, so /shouting repeatedly is often appreciated.
