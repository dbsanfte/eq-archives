You can train the basics of Dodge at 22 on mages.  Then, mobs
hitting you will give it a chance to raise.  I never put any 
extra points (beyond the first 1) in it, and it maxed very 
quickly (at 75 for int casters).  Even at that level I often
dodge one of the shots coming at me (out of 2 500+ hits and
a 100+ bash)
