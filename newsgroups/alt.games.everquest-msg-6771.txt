Mobs that are higher in level will incrementally have higher resistances.
Mobs more than 6 levels higher than you will resist about 100% of your
spells. If in doubt, cast Lifetap first. If it resists Lifetap, it will
resist just about any other attack spell you cast on it.

Field of Bone goes all the way up to level 20ish, so at 7 you should still
be in the "pit", killing whatever cons blue. At 8, grab Mend Bones, Bone
Walk and Ward Undead, and then concentrate on killing undead; that will be
your strong suit until 12ish.
