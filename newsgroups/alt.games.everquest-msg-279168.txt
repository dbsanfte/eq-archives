Since this is the first I've seen it mentioned to not be working (though
with the reminder I do remember that change being announced), and even
*you* "just found" it in spite of it having been supposedly changed for more
than two months, maybe they aren't even aware of it.  There are many changes
that get announced and for some odd reason don't make it to the live
servers.  In the latest patch, the pet focus changes, rogue SoS/see invis
change, and others never made it live.  As hard as this is for even me to
believe, Sony doesn't seem to realize these things unless and until someone
brings it to their attention.  So /feedback or /bug and tell them that they
forgot to make the change that they said they were making.  =)
