Hello,

I'm thinking of starting an Iksar shaman character and some of my friends
are considering starting a couple of "evil" characters, a dark elf and
troll - looking to base themselves around Neriak.

Being an Iksar obviously I'm going to start a long way away and I'm curious
about a couple of things:

Are Iksar KoS at either Neriak or the Troll city?

If not, what's the quickest way to get there from the Iksar continent
starting point? ( I'm hoping to make a mad dash somehow - maybe after a few
levels - and look to get a bind when I'm there, perhaps save up some money
first to pay the binding PC )

Any ideas or useful links would be appreciated. This may be a "You can't do
that" type of question but I figured it'd be worth knowing anyway :)
