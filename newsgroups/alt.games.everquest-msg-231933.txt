The difference: Were these games that stored player data server-side
exclusively played on their servers? The idea for making people play
separate characters on the server vs modem/IP connect games didn't
seem viable at the time, especially given the uncertainty whether
people would use BNet as their primary online play.

Actually, it DOES make a huge difference. The non-commercial MUDs
don't have to deal with anything near the scale of player and data
that a successful commercial game would have to endure. The most
popular MUDs I've seen have a couple hundred, MAYBE a thousand
players. Diablo's player base numbered in the MILLIONS. Scale of the
playerbase makes a world of difference in viability of holding
server-side data.

Again, see the first part above about online only games exclusively on
the official servers vs games that give you the options.

Nice snipping of the rest of that paragraph...
