I only have a 1x/2x AGP Slot as well.  You will have no problem
running a GeForce.  I recently purchased a VisionTek Xtacy 5564
GeForce 2 MX400 64mg AGP and although I dont have SoL, it installed
and works flawlessly.

Even thier top of the line GeForce3 Ti500 64meg DDR simply requires a
2x  slot:

� AMD K6-2, Intel Pentium II class processor, or higher
� 64MB RAM
� AGP 2.0 Compliant Socket
� A CD-ROM drive
� 10MB available disk space
� Windows 95OSR2 (or higher) or LINUX

From what I have read, here mostly, the biggest advantage to using the
GeForce line of cards is the driver support.  A couple others have
stated that ATI tends to be slow about getting updated drivers out
whereas nVidia tends to punch them out quite often.
