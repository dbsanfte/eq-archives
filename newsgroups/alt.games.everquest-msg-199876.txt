Which is completely irrelevant.    Do you consider going to a restaurant
with your "flesh and blood friends" to be a "repetative and redundant

acting touchy...  Made me go back and delete out the personal attack(s) that
could have turned this into an entertaining little flame war.   I guess I'll
have to settle for being a kindler, gentler ass myself now. ;P...  bastage.
