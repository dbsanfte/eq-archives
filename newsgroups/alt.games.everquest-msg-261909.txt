I guess my expectations were unrealistic because of that post. Maybe I
should leave that part till later. I've been reading about the corrupted
brownie. I have a 57 monk i can 2 box with and i'm hoping that that will be
enough if i see the tainted to lure it in for a fight and hopefully kill,
and can grab a 65 mage friend if he's about when the critter spawns.
