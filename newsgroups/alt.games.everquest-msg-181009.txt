Thanks for your comments. There are some quests I will definately be
looking in to.

I have folowed the little kitty home so many times people are starting
to talk. I always get a compass as reward which sells for 1pp 6gp.
Does the reward ever vary? I need some plat to raise my pottery skills
to get my drum.

I still haven't zoned out of the city. The more I look the more I find
to do. The game is nicely balanced at his level.
