I've got a Level 23 Halfling Cleric and am looking to start up an enchanter
to make it a clay wisdom deity (+2 WIS) for my cleric.  I've long planned to
start up an enchanter but have put it off until my cleric hits 49.  But now
that I want to get my cleric a clay wisdom deity, I thought now would be a
good time to at least create my enchanter.  Maybe not level it except for
the pottery skill at this time.  To keep down costs of raising my pottery
skill (ah, the joys of being a poor cleric),  I've taken my cleric into the
Gorge outside of Runnyeye and hunted Muddite Minors and Muddite Elders.
They always drop at least one small size clump of clay.  The elders
sometimes drop large sizes, Muddite clay, and silver bars.  However, I've
read that you need a medium size lump of clay to make medium jars and bowls.
Can you also use large clumps of clay for these recipes?  I wish you could
combine small clumps into medium ... and then mediums into large.  It would
make sense to be able to do this.  Anyway, these unfired jars and bowls are
good ways to raise one's pottery skill.  However, again, neither the Minor
or Elder has dropped a medium size clump of clay.  Or do they?  It is odd
they drop small and large but not mediums ... or so is my experience.
