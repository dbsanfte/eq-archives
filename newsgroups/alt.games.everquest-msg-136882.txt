Keep.  You can bind at the bank which is one floor above the action (I 
always get people to bind me *behind* the banker, just in case the shit 
hits the fan, so to speak - the trains there aren't too nice), and, 
well, the bank is REALLY close :)  Exp is really really really good 
there, I was jumping a level each night without putting any effort into 
it whatsoever.  Still there at 31, still getting about half a level a 
night with the same non-amount of effort.  In addition, the goblins drop 
FS weapons, ringmail armor, and HQ ore, each of which sell for up to 4 
plat each, and the goblins themselves usually have a couple plat on 
them.

Problems: hard to find a group at peak times.  I usually ask if there's 
a list.  If there's not, I sit down and wait, and usually get in within 
20 minutes or so.  If there is, I'll move on and go play at the bazaar 
or practice tradeskills for the day or somethin (this would be why I 
don't level so fast :)).  Also, like I said, the (albeit rare) raider 
trains are VERY bad.  If you're fighting in the GR (guard room), you're 
right in the path, and most of the morons who *do* train don't bother 
mentioning it.  In a crowd it's tough to notice them, so you may be dead 
before you realize what just happened.  You can fight in the LR to avoid 
this, but it's such a slow spawn, it's hardly worth it.  However, once 
you hit 25 you can move to the WR which is a separate room and much 
easier to avoid trains with, assuming the morons don't decide that 
you're only fighting 2 warriors right now and can surely help with 3 
raiders on top of that... *g*  You may want to get one more level, btw.  
On our server, at least, 20 seems to be a fairly firm number to be 
allowed into a group.  I suggest the orcs at the entrance to Highpass 
Hold, or getting a group together in the LR, where it's slow, but safe.  
Fighting the orcs, you *may* get lucky and get the rare spawn of one of 
the Shralok brothers, one drops a weight reduction bag, the other a 
shiny brass idol.  Fighting in the LR, you'll level faster, and get a 
reputation (hopefully good ;p) that will help you get into groups when 
you're ready for more action.

Ryou
(I feel I should point out that I've never played in Runnyeye, 
though...)
