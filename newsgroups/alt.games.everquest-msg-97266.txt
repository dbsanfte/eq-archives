 Guess it just kinda happens that way. =)   I got yelled at the other day
for healing a guy. lol  He was working on using bind wound and I didn't
notice. Guess I shoulda asked first.
 Only real problem I have as a druid is the rudeness. I get tired of being
hounded for heals and sow and when I give them I get no thanks, kiss my ass
or nothing. It kinda makes you want to just ignore people and go about your
business. I did once heal a girl a couple times and she never would ever
speak to me. Guess what? Next time she died I sat right there and watched.
haha   Just the breaks of being a druid man, your hated until they need you
for something. Take care and good luck.
