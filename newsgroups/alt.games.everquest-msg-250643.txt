Given what you just said the answer should be simple.. the one wearing
the Small Cloth Sandals isn't a half-elf, that's why the problem. I
would look very closely at the race name in the inventory window on
each.. when you setup the character you probably accidentally picked
one of the slightly differing elves for that character.
