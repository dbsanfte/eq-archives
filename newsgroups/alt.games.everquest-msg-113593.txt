I was in Frountier Mountains at level 30 and got jumped by two giants.  Died
and made the stupid mistake of not doing a /loc before death.  I could not
find my corpse at all.  Had to pay 400pp for a coffin so a necro could do a
summon corpse.  I am not aware of any zone that a necro cannot summon a
corpse from.
