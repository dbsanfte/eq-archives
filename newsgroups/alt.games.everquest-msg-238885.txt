>Heh  - I find sitting around frustrating.  

I do too.  Especially:
1 - early in the morning when there's no one in the right level range even
LOOKING for a group. 
2 - when you wait for a few minutes for a player that's *on the way* to fill
the last spot.  So you aren't even looking for someone else, becuase the GL
already has someone picked out.  25 minutes later the GL announces he's not
coming after all.
3 - when you've waited for someones *friend* who takes so long that other
players drop out because they are tired of waiting

I was referring to LDON groups though.  BoT isn't really the same dynamic.
