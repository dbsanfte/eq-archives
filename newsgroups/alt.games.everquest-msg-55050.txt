Yes you were right !
I got myself a nice robe now. and 3 blue bubs of exp less hen I started
with.

If anyone hasn't noticed it, the drop tables are thus:
Specters: int-casters
Gargoyles: rogue, monk, bard
Horses: wis-casters
Drakes: war, pal, sk

The "upgraded" versions have way more chance to drop stuff, but the normal
ones can as well.
Not sure where the ranger items dropped on though. Probably Gargoyles.

Also, for some no apparent reason I've had roughly 20 wis-caster earrings
drop on me. Every wis-caster in the zone, even the lvl 20 ones, had one
eventually.
