I have to admit, I got a bit twitchy holding down the camp.  At one 
point someone came up and hailed me while I was reading the paper 
waiting repop.  I sent them a Hello tell, they sent one back, I asked if 
  they were passing thru, got no response, and spent the next 20 minutes 
looking over my shoulder while making sure to engage every mob the 
instant of pop.

Hard to relax when you're holding a camp bringin in ten times the cash 
you are used to.

Other than that, I've gotten a couple polite inquiries, seen a few camp 
checks that I responded to and never got a challenge of any sort.  I did 
have someone offer to join me... so I gave her the camp when I logged out.

Well the problem is much less prevelant on Firiona Vie... because of the 
  low server population but also because of the Trivial Loot Code; 
Chipped gems are magic items, so if the geonids are green to anyone in 
your they don't drop the gems.

You probably see one Focus Gem per cycle of ten, and one Chipped Diamond 
per ten Focus Gems... really struck it lucky there first time out of the 
box.  If every Geo was like that, it wouldn't be ten times the cash of 
anything else I can manage, it would be 190 times as good!

Splendid One, 48 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
