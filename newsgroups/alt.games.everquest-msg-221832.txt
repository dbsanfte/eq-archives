If you hand in 1 stack of 4 it counts as 1, you need to put 1 whisker
in each of the 4 slots. control+left click picks up 1 whisker.

You find it on mobs..

Often they are for quests, you can either destroy them and run the
risk you wanted them later, or, put them in the bank.

Sometimes you can swim away and come back and it works, pressing space
sometimes works too, as it semi jumps, or there maybe a better spot to
try it on.  If there was a ladder, you need to look up a lot to move
up, you may have needed to look up more to get out too
