I think warriors have the worst"carrot on the end of the stick"ep deal
ever(don't know how else to say it).At 6th level they get bash and dodge at
10 they get parry,13 dual wield ,15 double attack then its a long wait until
25th to get riposte then a looong wait until the final ability of disarm at
35th level after that nuthin'.Almost all other classes have something to
look forward to,ie spells.I'm a Druid ,my second is a warrior,so I get
spells every 5 levels..something to look for.I think they need to make
attack abilities for warriors to give them something to look forward to
every 5 levels.Even if its just eye candy.
