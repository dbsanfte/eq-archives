This is, actually, what I was referring to.  You can 'tag' a mob without 
doing any damage.  This occurs in one of two ways: 1) you are pulling with a 
gun/bow/throwing weapon and you miss.  2) you are a mage, paladin, priest, 
or warlock and your first spell gets resisted.  You have still 'tagged' the 
mob, however, someone can come along and still do damage to the mob, KS'ing 
it.
