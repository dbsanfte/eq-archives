Ah, good point. I am on the FV server, so of course I tend to forget what is
no drop and what isn't on other servers. Still, controlled random rolls
should work; if Monk A won a mask last raid, and a similar one drops, but
Monk B needs it worse than Monk A, either Monk A shouldn't roll, or
shouldn't be allowed to roll.

Again, though, that all comes down to honor and personal responsibility,
which requires maturity and discipline on the part of all the
players...something that ain't gonna happen on EQ.
