Well since a druid can port is he bound to see everyone ported when
they wish? After all its a class ability. Or how about the necro? Is
he required to rez if no cleric is in the group? He can you know. Or
getting back to clerics, are they bound to cast symbol on who ever
wants it period? Answer to all is no, Unless you are paying for my EQ
account you dont get to make the rules son. In short its good to do
everything you can to help,  BUT there is no obligation to do so.

Its like the loot and scoot rule in PvP, if the guy was honorable I
will leave the zone. If they take advantage, they better be ready for
the shit storm to follow cause Im coming after em prob with help. In
other words due to their actions I either do or do not owe them
anything.

Simple there are no rules, only guildlines and common sense.
