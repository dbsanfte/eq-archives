    I imagine the change is being motivated by high-end PoP monks and their
complaints. There's a lot of pulls these days that are made through mounds
of trash mobs, or where mounds of trash mobs have to be split into smaller
trains. We simply don't let monks pull most of that. Bards can Lull, bards
can Escape. A 100% mem blur feign helps a lot of the issues that monks faced
in those situations.

    I'd /feedback if I were you, and explain why you like mobs to remember
you. SOE should hear from other PoP-guild monks too, and not just the ones
pulling Solusek Ro's Tower or Plane of Fire.
