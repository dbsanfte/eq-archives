From what I can tell in the character creation 'freebie" you get for
pre-ordering*, Frogloks are not available as a starting race... at first.
(All other races ARE unlocked though...)  When you hover over the "blank
portrait", you get the following"

Rumors have surfaces the frogloks are facing grave peril! Follow the clues
scattered throughout Norrath on how you can aid this noble race and make
them available to play.


Any thoughts on this (besides the fact the character models probably just
haven't been finished yet /grin).


BTW, all the freebie utility does is handle the cosmetic aspects of your
character. :)

I know it's just a preliminary tool, but boy.. do the half-elves look
fugly -- a sort of Sex Pistols meets Tolkien. The characters themselves look
a LOT like SWG models, but that's just my opinion.


*I got mine today at a Gamestop in Arlington, Texas.
