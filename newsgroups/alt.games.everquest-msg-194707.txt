I have no idea.
Just try various chars in various locations.

Start a new char, play it for a night. See how you like it.
Next night start another one, try it for a night.

Eventually, you may come down to a chr that you like over others.

At the worst, when it comes time for grouping, you will have eight
different chrs that you can play with to help balance the groups you
join.

To me, warriors are simple. Just whack it and kill it.
Bards can be fiddly as they cover a lot.
