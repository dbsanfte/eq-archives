Don't let the "hate list" and "/assist the mob" thing confuse you.  Yes,
these are good tools to use to check and see if a mob is rooted and part
of somebody's pull, or just happnes to be standing around in the area. 
However, particularly as you level up in to nastier areas, you'll find
mobs running around all over who are part of somebody's "lazy aggro".

What this basically means is that the mob has somebody on their hate
list who is in the zone, but that player is too far away for the mob to
go chasing them. Also known as being beyond the mob's "awwww, fuck it"
range.

The puller in places like Skyfire, Fear, Hate, and (as we recently found
out) Jagged Pines, can often wind up aggroing the random mob but out
running their range where they will chase them. Problem is, you stay on
the mob's hate list. And if that mob wanders past another mob, now
*that* one will have you on it's hate list. In Skyfire in particular, in
no time at all you can have a dozen or more mobs painting a target on
your back, and you never even saw most of them!

So you *can* on occasion run into mobs that you /assist and they have
somebody on their list, but they are still fair game and not being
pulled. Just use common sense. If they are right nearby a fight in
progress and have one of the fighters on their hate list they are
engaged. If they are out in the open, alone and hanging around, they are
probably fair game.
