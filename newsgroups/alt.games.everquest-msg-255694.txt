    Stop right there. I only want to raid Quarm to improve my character. But
I don't improve my character in any way over grouping except that I'm better
when I want to kill another raid mob in the future. But I have no reason to
kill that raid mob because he doesn't improve me, except if.... see the
problem?

    Then why do I want the raid gear and not the "good" gear? I bet it'll be
much easier to get the "good" gear, and I'm all about maxing reward for
effort (that's why I raid). Under your description, the only people who'd
raid would be bored folks that had all the best group gear and were just
dying for something else to do.
