The reason is because the article was not just about PvP even though a
few people here seem to have missed that point. Shadowbane's flaws are
widespread and fundamental; that makes it rather useless to use in
comparison to other games - there's too many reasons for people to
leave it to make it a useful measuring stick.

Not anymore its not.

I think DAoC escapes a scathing retort by the author because its
closer to UO than the EQ he despises, but still so far away that it
doesn't solve any of the problems he is addressing.

If DAoC had any point to its "player interaction" and had a lot more
freedom than it currently offers, he would probably have had more kind
words to say about it.

DAoC is no longer a PvP game. It's a PvE game that happens to have PvP
in limited areas.
