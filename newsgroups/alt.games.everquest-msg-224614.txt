Or at the very least they could have spared some unwelcome commentary:

"Ooh it's close, neck and neck, will he live? Oh another add from left
field, looks like he is really in trouble now folks - can he make the zone
line? No - it is too far -what must be going through his mind folks?"

<<you yell for help>>

"And the cry for help has gone up but is there anyone here to answer? Anyone
give a rats?"

em: looks around

"Someone must be able to help him? Any good samaritans?"

em: crickets chirping

"Well - looks like he's shit outa luck folk.... and down he goes....and
yes - the Hill Giants high five and do a victory dance on his head "

/pause 40

/tells you: "..and a stylish death it was too folks, a lovely bounce at the
end and just look at the artistic flair in how his spleen is left hanging
out his left nostril. Stay tuned after the break we have...."
