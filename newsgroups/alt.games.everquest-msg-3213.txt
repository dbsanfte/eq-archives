There is no best newbie class, and there can be no correct answer to
your question - it all depends on what you want to play, and what
gaming style you enjoy.

Personally, I started with a warrior, as it seemed the simplest class
to play. I wanted to learn the game mechanics and such prior to
selecting my primary class.

Now I mostly play a druid, because it best suits my style - I like to
wander all over the world of Norrath, and a druid is best suited for
that.

Try a variety of classes, and just see which one rings your bell.
