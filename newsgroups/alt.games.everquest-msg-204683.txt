Actually John, there was a workaround for this as I mentioned in my
other post.  All you had to do was take a death fro the dead frogs
and you would be able to get faction hits again, for a while.  It
was painful, but it worked and there were at least a few folks who
did it.  And, despite the popularity of conspiracy theories, it
seems far more likely to me that they fixed it when they did because
it took that long for it to make it to the top of the list and then
hunted down and squished.  IOW, your presumption seems unwarranted.
In fact, not too long after Velious came out they "fixed" some
faction hits there, and included a message about it along the lines
of it being done to prevent you from having good faction with enemy
sides (i.e. giant and CoV) on the same character, something quite a
few people managed to do with a number of old-world factions and
some Kunark factions as well.
