To me this one thing is enough...for now, anyway.  It's WAY too freaking
much trouble to get to Kael any other way than WL and if you're not in an
uberguild you won't know before you port if Wuoshi's up.

BTW, here's a very cool piece of info that I've only recently learned.

Want to get to Kael?  Port to WL and Evac.  Takes you to about 50' of the
zone line. :)
