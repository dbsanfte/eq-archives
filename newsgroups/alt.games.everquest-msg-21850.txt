In several of the groups I've been in, that's how the healers keep control
of the pullers.  Heal them to full health, they'll immediately run off to
pull something, even if they're told not to.  So, you just don't heal them
until you're ready.  That may not have been what was going on in your
group, but I have seen it done.  On the other hand, if they don't respond
at all, they're probably just experience sponges.  Boot them, and then keep
track of how long it takes them to notice.  If it's more than about 10
seconds before they send you a "WTF!?" tell, they're probably watching TV
instead of the group, so you most likely don't want them around anyway.
