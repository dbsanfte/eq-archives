I hate dieing, it makes me feel terrible.  As a 100% soloer, halfing druid
who just dinged 37, I was already searching for a new, safe place to hunt
for XP when the new zone, Nedaria's Landing, came along.  Based on the
descriptions of others, it seemed like a possibly good choice.  After
traveling there, I have a couple questions:

1) I killed one light blue and one dark blue there, but didn't see my XP bar
go up at all.  Can experience really be earned hunting there?

2) I also received no faction messages.  I've never hunted in Jaggedpine
either, out of fear of faction hits.  What faction hits need I fear hunting
animals in these zones?  Do I have to steer clear of all the wolves and
bears here?  What about in other zones?  (I really tried google to find out
about this, to no avail.....)

3) Finally (and sorry in advance for this) where can I hunt given my
preferences: solo, safe, not quadding, prefer outdoors (because of light),
dark blue mobs for me at 37, no negative faction hits?  (Yes, I know, I'm
probably asking for too much!)

Thanks for any information
