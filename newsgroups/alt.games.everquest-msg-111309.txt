How do you expect someone to know the stats of every item in the game?  That
wasn't your exact words, but that is what your argument here boils down to.
"If you would ever possibly consider buying an item, you would know the
stats beforehand."
That's the most elitist statement I have seen so far this week (although the
week is still young).

I suppose you know the stats of every item in the game that you might ever
possibly want to buy for a given race or class?  Don't be absurd.  If you
saw someone auctioning an item you had never heard of before, would you ask
for the stats?  How else would you know whether you wanted it or not?  It's
not unreasonable to think that you might find yourself in a situation where
you hadn't researched a certain item being offered for sale.
