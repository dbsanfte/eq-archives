They don't have a clue about making games. They don't make games. They
buy game companies and they publish 3rd party games. Just because they
make money doing the same things other companies lose money at doesn't
mean they know the PC game industry. It just means they know how to
make money :P

It's their own fault those things happened. Up until about 1991,
retailers would put out just about any game you asked them too. There
were maybe 30 games a year coming out, and almost all of them were
excellent games. Then the PC revolution happened and all of a sudden
there was a computer in every home and the game companies though GOLD
MINE and started cranking out a gazillion point-and-click slide shows
that they called games and started pouring in huge bucks into
marketting, think they'd all get even richer than they were... but
that isn't what happened. Instead, their talented people quit - not
wanting to be associated with idiotware and all - and they hired
droves of new age multimedia gurus and marketting whiz kids and drove
themselves into the ground.

No, they made their own beds. It wasn't the retailers, it wasn't
customer expectations, it wasn't any of the convenient excuses. It was
just old style corporate stupidity.

They made it so. The zip lock baggy thing was done in the early 80s.
There was a good 10 year period where games came in boxes, with
perfectly decent manuals, and multiple floppies. In fact, the manuals
in the 80s were probably better, on average, than the manuals now.
I've still got a bunch if you wanna compare :P

Most of the increased cost that happened when PC game makers went
after the mythical mass market is associated with bloated payrolls,
not packaging.

Are you serious? I'm in the anti-Microsoft camp these days but to deny
the impact they had on the computer industry in general and the PC
industry in particular during the 80s would be revisionist history at
it's worst.

I just hope it doesn't take complete extinction of the industry before
somebody, somewhere, comes up with a better way of doing business.
Even Microsft will abandon the PC game industry before long... they
don't have much interest in niche markets these days, unless there's a
potential that they will become mainstream at some point. And I think
it'd take some kinda fool to believe the PC industry will ever be
mainstream now, after more than a decade of people trying and failing
to make it so.
