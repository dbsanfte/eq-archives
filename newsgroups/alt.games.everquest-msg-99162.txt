I think almost everyone has been overreacting in one way or
another.

The changes for levels 1-10 obviously won't have zero impact.
At the same time, they won't spell certain doom for EverQuest.

My opinion is that nobody is capable of having a truly informed
opinion until these changes have been in at least a few weeks.
And even then, if you have a lot of experience with EQ, your
opinion of the results might be tainted.

I've seen posts from some uber-players complaining about how
horrible levels 1-10 are now.  But levels 1-10 aren't FOR them.
Levels 1-10 are for *true* newbies.  They're meaningless levels
for anyone with any moderate to high level characters.

Probably the best issue I've seen raised is that your skills
don't go up fast enough to keep up with the new xp curve from
1-10.  That seems like a valid concern to me.

I think most other concerns are unfounded.  *True* newbies
will be too dizzy from learning the game and having fun to
realize they can "exploit" the changes by setting their bind
point right in the middle of orc hill (for example and in my
opinion).  And by running to extremely dangerous zones and
just looting other player's kills.

I started a wood elf ranger last night.  I played about an hour
and got to level 3.  Apparently, I *suck*.  :)
