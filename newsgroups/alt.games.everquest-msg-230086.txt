I recall when this wasn't a bad item for a level 55 cleric to be toting 
around... course that was several expansions ago and all, but its not 
really bad at all.  There's also a bonus to your meditation skill, which 
will mean a lot more to a low level than to someone who's skill is 
already at cap; basically you'll get 10% more mana back while sitting on 
your butt, which of course is a cleric's principle occupation.

This item, on the other hand, seems very lame.  Better ratio weapons 
abound, the two resists are pathetic, so you are left with the 6 wis. 
These days a twink cleric would have to work hard not to be up at 200+ 
wis by level 20, and then LDoN will start feeding you wis augments to 
stack on top of that.  As a bonus, the thing is no drop so you can't 
even hand it off to some level 1 character you find wandering around 
lost in POK.

6/24?  I'd be embarassed to even call myself a twink with something that 
lame.

Funny thing is, recently I've been playing numerous characters on 
Discord, and my most prized possession on many of them has been a 
storebought Short Sword, which has the mighty ratio of 4/22.  6/24?  I'd 
be a God!

I don't know enough about the quest to say, but AR is either pretty 
easy, or incredibly hard, depending on what you are after.  Easy is the 
mobs, which generally aren't bad for their level, and huntable in your 
mid 50s, by 61 they should be pushovers.  Hard are the traps which 
trigger a kind of mob (mind wurm?)  that proc a mana tap, and which seem 
to deliberately go for mana users far more than regular mobs might. 
Sucked dry of mana and being beat to a pulp puts a real damper on most 
classes combat ability... unless you were going in with a pure melee 
group, which isn't likely.

(hmm, I don't know if their ability also sucks down a bard's mana pool, 
at any rate they wouldn't stop him singing, but dry mana pool means no 
more charms)

Splendid
