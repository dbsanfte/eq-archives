Research, as a skill, is trivial, not onerous.

Wait till level 24 to buy it.  This gets it for you at
level 24.  Dump the remaining points in to max
it out at that level.  Each time you level dump
5 more points in.  There are literally no other
useful places to put points, except for the occaisional
one point into a trade skill.

Get your research book (whichever class) and
put the items in, combine, hope you don't fail...but
there's not a thing you can do to alter those odds other
than keep that skill maxed out.

Its gathering the words, runes, various components thats
really annoying.

Also, your advice to have a higher level person do the
combine is still valid even if you have followed my plan
and have a maxed out skill.  Since the skill cap goes
up five points each level, that guy ten levels higher than
you has a skill 50 points higher.  The way EQ handles
failures means that although a combine might be trivial
to you, its still likely not as failure free as it would be
with a higher skill.

Course if you really want to leave the whole issue
behind, the trick is just to buy the spells outright, instead
of doing all the work of getting the ingrediants whether
you do it yourself or not.  No chance of failure that
way, either.
