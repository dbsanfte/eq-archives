Here's the secret to getting the AC in SRo.  Head north, zone to Oasis.  Keep
going north, zone to NRo.  Keep going north, zone to East Freeport.  Head for
the dock.  Wait for the boat if the Translocator isn't up, either way, get to
OOT and Sister Island.  Now swim across to the AC island.  Here's a single
spawn point, mob every 6 minutes like clockwork, rare is the AC.  Six hours or
so later, you've got your ring and no fuss or bother.

Don't waste your time hanging around SRo looking for the version of the AC that
spawns there, he's a random rare that appears somewhere in the zone, and there
will almost certainly be several other hapless fools camping him at the same
time, happy to come KS you if they can, or at least embroil you in all the fuss
and bother that a KSing attempt, even a failed one, tends to kick up.
