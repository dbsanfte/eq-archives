That would be one of those thoughts ;)

Three off one spider? Impressive.
I've always noticed my skill raises. I got one off a black reaver
once, I almost could forgive him for killing me.

It's ok. It's fun to see how much you hate me :p

Face slot is the one I'd like a proper upgrade to the most, but I am
not too troubled about it. I carry a splitpaw hide mask around for
resists :)

I'm trying to get a froggy crown for my resist gear and wouldn't mind
seeing a woven grass headband one day.

>> Shimmering slime necklace

Warden symbol would be too slow for me (I see a LOT of root breaks
even with engorging when I solo). I also have a white gold necklace
for when I need fire/cold resists instead.

>> Earring of woven bark

>Good stuff, hp/mana rocks.

>Wearing twisted leaves and a pixie rib.

Woven bark earring will go to a guildie when/if I get a treant tear. I
have a BD earring as well for resists.

>Obulus Death Shroud here, will swap it out for 5th shawl though.

Heh. The guy who is making mana vials for me has been scarce the past
few days, and once I trivial Wu's, I intend to take a ranger with me
to WW for velium hounds. I've had some manticore manes forever and
will go stalk sirens when I am 59 and have wildfire, I guess.

Well, this one has sentimental value. I got it last Halloween in a GM
event (the one in OoT where a GM paladin had us gather a bunch of
people to fight some evil zombie sailors, he awarded me the cloak
after we'd killed them. It will never ever leave my hands).

No point in vel jaspers, like there is no point in a velium ruby veil.
I have no real use for 2 extra wis, especially not there.

>I hate you, I've just got dinky thurgadin (still better than ES arms though)

7.5 seconds.

>> Vermiculated bracer
>
>Good stuff, but I'm not sure if I'd switch my supple scale bracer for it or

It has better total resists, and the wis is nice for my tradeskilling.
I wear it together with my supple scale bracer when I need fire
resists. It's also the only piece of planar armor I have :)

>> Nathsar vambraces
>
>Same here, contemplating switching to giant scalemail for more ac/hp though.
>(stupid me already vendored one set of scalemail arms)

I'm yearning for woven grass sleeves, to match the bracer. Other than
that, CC sleeves might look cool and Rowyl's metal armplates would
*really* look cool, but pigs fly if I ever get those :)

>
>I really really, REALLY hate you.  My Shroud of nature isn't bad, but I've
>had it on forever and want to get rid of the leather BP look (don't even
>suggest BCP for that, I hate those things)

I replaced my shroud of nature with an elven chainmail tunic. Wore
that till someone shouted about a tunic rotting when I was on a UP
minis raid :p

>> Black chitin leggings (yes, I said black chitin leggings)
>
>Ummm.... ok.  Given that a 55 mage friend of mine just switched from these

They're the cheapest thing available that isn't lederhosen. I'll wear
them till I get something that looks like chain (ES, gladiator,
elysian).

>> Coldain skin boots

>Same.

I'll probably go for woven grass boots when I am way over the wis cap,
but till then, I'm sticking with these :)

Ceremonial smudging stick?
I'm aiming to get a talisman of benevolence one day.

>> Sarnak battle shield

>Same.  ac/hp/saves =  WHEEE.

I want a lodi shield. (Yes, it'd be back worn when I needed resists,
but shield worn otherwise.)

My hunting gear could have better resists, that's all.

Heh. You're wearing better stuff than I did at 52.

>Ouch, that sucks a lot.

Oh yeah. And now, I have three phone numbers that used to belong to a
friend. One number is out of use, another was answered by a guy who
had never heard of my friend, and the third is an out of range cell
phone. I called another friend (and found out she's pregnant and
expecting in July) and she didn't have any new numbers. Feh.
