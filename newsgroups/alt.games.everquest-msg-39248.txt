I'm sorry, but nope... I've had things con other than indiff while minorly 
illusioned.  It resets your base faction to indifferent with everything, 
however, if you've killed 6.3 million kobolds, it ain't gonna help you out 
with kobolds much.  They'll mark territory all over your sorry tree stump.

Similarly, minor illusion + alliance will make many things amiable.

You can talk to NPCs and complete quests as well as trade with NPCs while 
under this illusion. 

It's a terribly useful spell. :)
