The normal Quiver can be player-made.  I also think it can be bought.

For a very long time there has been a Fleeting Quiver pattern in game, but 
there was no recipe for it.  Tailors should now be checking to see if there 
is now a recipe for it (no, I have no idea if it has been fixed).  Go to 
www.eqtraders.com and check their message board (the Tailoring forum) for 
the most up-to-date info on this.
