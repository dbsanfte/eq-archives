I dunno about that, I've avoided replying to most of the posters
due to the rather pointed "sharpening of claws" that seems to have
become the norm.  I have to wonder whether these religiously anti-
religious folks have spent any time reflecting on how their views,
as expressed here, read when one is not a "true believer" of their
particular flavor of reality.
