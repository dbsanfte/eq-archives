Happened to my necro pet in GD he kept walking against the mountain
wall north of the dragon ring an vanished, neither hide nor /pet get
lost helped, tried to summon another but got that i could only have 1
pet at the time, but lost 240 mana :(

Had to log out and get back in again, by that time the blue mob was
way gone :(
