LOL not particularly, but I'm 41 yrs old and no matter where I've lived
one/both of their columns have always been on the comics page of the local
paper.  After 20+ of reading the paper (for me, the local news, comics and
perhaps the front page) you'll pick up on stuff as trivial as this topic. :)
Besides, the comics have gotten so BORING lately (and these are the "funny"
ones, not Dick Tracy or whatever) that Ann/Abby are often more entertaining.
