Like the lvl 3 ogre in full crustacean that I saw? :)

How do you guys stand on buying items for twinks but not letting them
use the stuff until they're 'worthy'? My baby mage is running around
in a gossimer robe, mammoth leggings, collar of undead protection and
a savant's cap, and wielding a stein of moggok and a cracked staff
(soon to be darkwood?) or a FS dagger. A week ago I got a deal I
couldn't refuse on an advisor robe and dustscryer's crystal ball, so I
bought those items and banked them - she'll get to use the ball in her
teens and the robe around the time she gets a last name. 

The twink level in the original post seems to be somewhat on the same
level of my mage's current getup and I'd consider that perfectly
acceptable for a new secondary character. The character doesn't have
to claw for every copper or piece of cloth armor, and isn't
'overtwinked' - the dangers of which are 1. not learning the true
limits of your char, since you're invincible at low levels and 2.
getting snickered at or mocked by other players.

(Twinking a druid can be fun... I restarted with high 30s gear and
*still* looked like a newbie :) )
