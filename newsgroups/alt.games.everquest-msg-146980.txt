Trying to quad snow cougars at level 30 is complete suicide unless you
are a *serious* twink of a post fifty player. The manapool just isn't
there, and the aggro in Iceclad is insane.

At that level, just stick to quadding the gnolls outside of splitpaw.
Much safer, they are slow, and you'll make some cash while learning the
secrets of quadding. At 34 you'll have the spells you really need to do
it and you can go do the dire wolves in GD until you are ready to move
on to walrus and Ulthorks around forty. (GD wolves *much* better than IC
since the entire IC zone is a deathtrap with noplace to run to.)
