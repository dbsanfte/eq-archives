Well as well as getting everybody back in, you have to be conscious of
agro/repops.
Rezzing a necro in = mana, somebody to fd during agro and say when its safe
to log back in, AND the ability to rez if a cleric never made it back out.

Chanters, whilst medding for c2, also provide stuns and mezzes (which are >
bards) which again could prove invaluable.

Actually I forgot to mention mages too, before the "rez anybody".  If you
have a rez stick cleric though, cleric mana isn't essential for rezzing.
