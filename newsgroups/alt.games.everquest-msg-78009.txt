I noticed this as well.  I got that fips program and watched my framerates.  I
was getting anywhere from 255 in LOIO by the beach, to 9 FPS @ the Fort and
also in FV.

I guess its a trade-off.  Fast zonetimes and a few slow areas, or Very sloe
zonetimes and better but not perfect choppyness in all zones.

P.S. My system is:
