The most cost effective way to try Everquest would be to pick up EQ Evolutions
Box Set.  It comes with all the *basic* expansions and will give you a good
feel for the game.  

Lost Dungeons of Norrath is nice, but you won't be able to do dungeons until
level 20 and Gates of Discord is for MUCH later on in your adventuring
career...  hehe

Evolutions is currently available from Amazon.com for $19.99 US.  I don't know
anything about where to buy it in Europe, but perhaps others here will know
that answer.

I also believe you get your first month of playing time free with a new
subscription, so it really is a good way to get a feel for the game.

Be advised though...  many classes don't really begin to shine until the late
30 levels and beyond.  The good news is, in today's EQ, getting to lvl 40 is
not all that difficult.

Good luck to you and check back in with us to let us know how you like it!
