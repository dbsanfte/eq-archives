    To take advantage of the deep-pipeling of the P4 architecture, the code
must be optimized for the P4 cpu. The opimizations should make no difference
on other cpu's, but will give the P4's quite a nice boost. This is one of
the first instances of a mainline program being optimized for the P4
archetecture that I am aware of, although I am sure there are a few others
by now. This is a sweet deal for P4 owners.
