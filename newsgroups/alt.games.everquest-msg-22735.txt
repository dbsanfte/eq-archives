I was whacking some snakes in the W. Freeport newbie zone looking for eggs, and
I'd been dropping all the fangs and scales I got instead of destroying them in
case some newbie wanted to pick them up and sell them.  After dropping a couple,
I watched a rat walk past me and the "bag" disappeared. I wondered the same
thing, but didn't kill the rat to find out. It may have just poofed, but it
looked like the rat picked them up.  I also killed one snake that had an orc
pick in it's loot.  Granted, somebody may have "seeded" the snake, but it would
be an odd choice of stuff to put on it, so the snake may have picked up the
weapon as well.
