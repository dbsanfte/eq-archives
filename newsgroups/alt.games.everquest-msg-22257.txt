Personally - It doesn't bother me a whole lot to hear people ask my druid or
shaman for
a SOW or other buff.  It's really the begging for cash or stuff from low
level players that
gets on my nerves.  I believe that there is plenty of generous people who
will give things
away and if not - earn them.  I don't even ask for buffs myself.  I try to
make do on what
I have.
