Yes, I do, as soon as it dropped I was dead.

At level 26ish, I got IU cast on me at the WC zone, ran along the north
wall, got a ways past the Rivervale entrance, running right by some of the
nasty undead, when IU starts blinking.  Well, the undead were between me and
the Rivervale zone, so I kept hoofing it to the HHP zone.  IU drops, next
thing I see is some undead mob is casting, LOADING...PLEASE WAIT.  I think
it took two spells to finish me off at the time.  But, I can vouch for the
fact that they did not see me while IU was up.
