255, until level 51, at which point you could buy some AA abilities to allow you
to go higher.  At 61+, without any AA, you get an extra 5 points to your cap per
level, and more AA are introduced to allow you to raise that cap still higher.
At 65 with all the AA options I think the cap is 360 or something equally
ludicrous.

However, you are only getting around 5.5 mana per point of int over 200, so you
really don't see as much benefit from the added INT as it might seem.  Since you
seem to have your INT solidly over 200 anyway, use a comparison of say 6 mana
per int (to account for some of the other marginal help a high int gives) when
looking at items that might be an upgrade, frequently you can add 10 or even 20
mana for the cost of a single point of added INT.
