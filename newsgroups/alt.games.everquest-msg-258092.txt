See, those are very good reasons for a mage not to have a pet without pet 
hold.  Or possibly a Necro/beastlord, I'm not sure what the ranges are 
like on the spells their pets use, but I suspect they're all melee range 
procs anyway.  Now, like I said, a chanter doesn't have the /pet hold 
option. ever.  So before banishing my pet to utter obscurity, I ask you to 
consider that reasons #1 and #3 don't apply to my silly  dancing 
scarecrow, and #2 is only going to matter if my pet actually gets 
close enough to hit the actual mob.  Which, with judicious and careful 
use, /pet back off is just fine for.

And failing that, Suspend Minion and/or summoning pet during fight should 
be equally good solutions, that don't require /pet hold.  So ease up on 
your pet casters and give 'em a way to make a reasonable contribution, eh?
