So long I don't remember for that level much. Basically Tash, Mez and Slow
are the mainstays of the line up. Dazzle is the best mez spell, the PoP ones
are shite, huge amounts of mana for high resist rates and low mez times,
focus items do not affect mez line. Using dazzle i have had 7 mob trains in
Seb locked down. Other spell slots you generally tailor to the situation and
who is in the group. I used to keep three AE stuns memmed. Cripple line of
spells are pretty pointless in groups situations. If you are going to charm
mobs in group situation then the 4th lvl mez is a good addition.
