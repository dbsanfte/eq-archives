 Eh. Based on the above that seems a bit heavy handed. People who are on
45 minutes before a scheduled raid time and still end up being late are
what annoys me. Other people work or go to school and log on when they
can. We don't tell them they can't come because they weren't online at
the time. Unless we're doing something like Grieg where CoH doesn't
work. Otherwise people still filter in late and we CoH them to us when
4-5 get in the zone.

 Late doesn't have to equal inconsiderate.
