Congratulations :)

Personally, even if the results of the quest aren't all that great, I'm
going to finish it simply for the sake of my own stupid pride and to show up
those naysayers who think I can't :)

Besides, so far the exp I've gotten from it hasn't been too bad... I got to
lvl 9 in a few days mostly on just the exp from the quest (and killing
things to get items for the quest)... now that I'm lvl 22 I have to kill a
lot of mobs to get the exp I need, but the little boosts I get from the
quest are nice when I have to log off in five minutes and I just need that
last little bit to ding (that's how I made lvl 22)...
