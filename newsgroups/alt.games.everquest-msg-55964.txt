Just a small point about this, it's been mentioned already on this group, AB
has been oversubscribed on the /movelog 3 times over. This was told by a
Verant employee to a player. So before you make too many plans about some
new guild on AB, it may be prudent to actually check that you have a
successful /movelog first.

In addition, from another post on this group, it mentioned that a whole
Asian guild were moving to AB. Given the over subscription, and the priority
for European players, I would say that will be a certain non-event.
