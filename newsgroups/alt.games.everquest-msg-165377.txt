one thing that sticks out to me, it try to save up for silver chitin
handwraps, 23%haste(iirc) and some ac and decent stats to replace the gem
inlaid gaunts and fbsss with a spider fur belt. if you sell the fbss you
should only need to come up with about 1-2k dependsing on your server, for
SCHW
and, the SF belt runs between 50 and 250pp again depending on your server.
those are the only two things that stick out to me, and i played a monk till
55, something else you may want to do is, head to the maidens eye(if you
have Luclin) and sit at the Zone in FDed and every 5-10minutes /ooc in a
nice manner that your looking to loot a goranaga spiked club thats going to
otherwise rot. usually people are more than happy to let ya loot as long as
you dont train them :) and its 12/23 and some stats at all, its nothing to
sneeze at thats for sure
