Well, to be honest, I think it's actually a good thing Necromancers are less
effective in the high level game. Necromancers are godly solo, why should
they be great in groups?

Clerics (just to name one class) are superb in groups, but pathetic solo.

All classes generally need each other. To allow one class to excel at both
solo and grouping seems a bit misbalanced and perhaps "unfair" to the other
classes.
