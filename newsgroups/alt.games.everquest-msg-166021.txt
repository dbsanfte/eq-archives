Complete Moron reporting for duty, Sir! <salute>

Ah, Bizbee... this newsgroup's premier stalker and aggressive poster.

Many posters in this newsgroup use names and addresses that appear to be
real; so by your logic, they're complete morons? No... they simply do not
piss people off like you have an alarming tendency to do, so they do not
draw negative attention.

In that respect, I don't think I've -ever- angered anyone off the ways that
you have - heh, in fact you used to have quite the following. Either way,
only one person has even hinted at stalking me.

If you do happen to hunt me down, which game do you like better? Monopoly,
Parcheesi, or Connect Four?

Practically anything can be found on the internet if the person cares
enough. If I remember correctly, your name has been brought up by one of
your 'fans' - even though you try to be anonymous.
