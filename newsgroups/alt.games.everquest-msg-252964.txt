A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the
name Sean Kennedy <x@y.z>:

>from a thread on graffes detailing changes on test:
>
>"- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits 
>they've selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the 
>Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his 
>benefits, he will be "Pre-pay" (see above). The ability to change selected 
>benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed.
>- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player's benefits will deactivate. 
>Players may re-organize their selected Benefit loadout, but will not be 
>able to "preview" the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when 
>the benefit is selected). Benefit descriptions should give the player a 
>good indication of what the Benefit will do when activated.
>- The EQ Label that shows the Tribute Benefit Timer will now show green 
>when benefits are active, grey when they are not."

This post is soooo yesterday. Get with the times, square!
