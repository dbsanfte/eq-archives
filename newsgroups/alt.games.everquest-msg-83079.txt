My guild doesn't have a high level bard, so I figured it would be a good
idea to level up mine.  Problem is, I really wasn't thinking down the road
when I created her.  I've got her worshiping Erolisi Marr, who I think is a
great goddess to follow.  Problem is, I wasn't thinking about faction.
Since I can start getting masks around level 30 or so, should I have gone
agnostic, like an enchanter?  I've also heard that Veeshan is practically
agnostic for faction purposes.  Any ideas?  I'm only level 8, so it won't be
too difficult to re-roll her.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
