Could charge ~5pp above 'Small Brick' price for boning, and about 4
times 'a piece' price for studs


Small Brick + water + file = Boning

2 x Piece + water = bit
3 x bits + water + file = 2 x Studs

Price them fairly, and you'll always sell out, simply because the bricks
aren't stackable, and the pieces require 2 combines.

Wish the market was glutted on my server. Trying to get tailoring to 200
before PoP and always waiting on Acrylia
