All is a black and white word.  Shouldn't use it unless you mean it.  My 
very objection, here, was that they used a black and white word which 
was patently false; the mushrooms (by the way, there's not one, but IIRC 
about 5), and Poxan's sword, were not randomly spawning incorrectly, 
they were consistently doing so, thru repeated zone repops.  Meanwhile, 
the Abandoned Orc Shovel spawned correctly at least 3 times.  I didn't 
check any further, personally, but chatting in the new player channel I 
was unable to find anyone who would report that any ground spawns 
outside the tutorial were missing.

I agree, they are quite possibly not deliberately lying, but rather 
ignorant.  I wouldn't normally extend that level of benefit of the doubt 
to a team dedicated to testing and attempting to eliminate bugs, but SOE 
has demonstrated an astonishing level of head-up-the-wazooness, and it 
is actually possible that they didn't check on other ground spawns 
before reporting that "all" were having issues; if they relied simply on 
a burst of reports from users who were encountering the ones which -are- 
borked, and leapt to the conclusion that "all" were screwed up, then 
they wouldn't be lying.  They'd merely be incompetant... and since these 
are the same people who reported (for example) that Alchemy was NOT 
broken despite repeated and persistant insistance by the player 
community that it "was too", I should have observed Hanlon's Razor here. 
   Mea Culpa.

On the other hand, I think the way I said it was more fun, but then I'm 
a conspiracy nut.  Try to imagine reasons they might be lying about 
something so easily checked, rather than simply use the word "some", 
which would be impossible to disprove.  (and have the virtue of being 
technically true even if only the tutorial spawns are bugged)
