    The old Ragefire spawned exactly that often, more or less, and was a
massively contested spawn. And you needed to have a cleric who had done all
the other steps of the quest to cap him then. Now anybody can go kill him.

    WORK /= WAITING. WORK /= WAITING. WORK /= WAITING. Stop the myth now!
Epics are only rare because they're kept rare by artificially low spawn
rates. Epics are not even remotely a status symbol, but are now for many
classes an expectation. "Yeah, whatever, grats on Freebringer. Yawn." "You
don't have res stick? But you're a 60 cleric!" (I get that last one a lot.)
Having players all bunched up at any stage of the game, fighting over
things, is bad. So why bunch them up over this? A cleric can't even get an
item that does something remotely similar, unlike say a warrior. Make the
Ragefire fight more difficult, but make it as triggered as Ixiblat.

    It also likely has something to do with how, on a typical server, high
level bards are a rare commodity. Clerics are legion. And that bard epic is
damned useful. :-)
