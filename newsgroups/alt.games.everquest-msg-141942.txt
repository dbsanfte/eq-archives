Embarrassing is like when I was hunting in Stonebrunt with friends who are
into innuendo, and I typed:

/gu No, dearie, we're not here to hunt that kind of pussy. We want the kind
that won't object when we collect pelts.

Yeah, I meant that for /g... and my guild is very very family oriented, and
*I*'m the one that usually polices other people's language. The rule for our
guild is that if a 9 y/o can't or shouldn't understand, it shouldn't be
said, because I know at least one 9 y/o who reads our guildchat.
