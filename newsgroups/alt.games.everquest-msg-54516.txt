What you guys need to take the Big Lizard:

A snarer. That's it. I know. Me (cleric), a mage, and a necro did
the lizard once, for the same reason you want to do it. Necro
Darknessed it, I feared it (and the necro too, in case mine got
resisted), the mage nuked, necro DoTed, they both sent pets in.
When Fear broke, whoever wasn't chased by it (usually me) would
re-apply it. Of course, the mage was high enough to solo it, but
I was 49, just like Tiru is now, and the necro was low-40s.

Sang is right (as usual =), Dino has a sucky MR. The necro got her
Fear and Darkness to stick more often than not, ferchrissakes. And
it drops those good gems too rarely for it to be really worth it...
Of course, if money's too tight to mention, it's a really safe way
to get BDs...
