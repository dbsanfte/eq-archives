Actually, this is what they've said all along.

The question I have is why you can't have *some* luclin models on, yet get
Velious armor graphics on the old world models you are using.

Making Velious armor unique with the new models would have been a pain.
Allowing the option to use it with the old models shouldn't have been a big
deal.
