Let's see, swap necro for druid, and I've heard the same complaint.  I have
to admit, I have grouped with some necros before, and generally thought they
were OK in the group, but nothing all that useful, until yesterday.  I have
grouped with people of all classes that the same could be said for, some
have great group skills, some just plain suck at grouping.
