That was the problem.  It hit *everybody* because it was, quite literally, a
screw up on Sony's part.  They screwed the patch up.  *Everybody* was
affected that tried to play.  They screwed it up again.  *Everybody* was
affected again.

Actually, I know exactly what caused it.  They added some Ykesha stuff to
EQUI.xml and didn't push down the appropriate *.xml file.  So as soon as you
zoned, with default UI or with a custom UI so it affected *everybody*, you
crashed.  It took one person zoning to find the problem.  If they "test"
without doing the absolute bare minimum basic things that people do in the
game (sit, vendor, zone, turn on attack)...  well, I still wouldn't call
that testing.

Just cause DarkTyger doesn't post 500 times a day doesn't mean Sony has a
job opening for "Apologist".  They are a big company, they can take some
heat without your help.  Especially when they do large and impressively
stupid screwups.

And "no offense" but when I say "everybody" and emphasize it like that, I
mean *everybody*.  If you tried to play while they were pushing down the
screwed up patches, you crashed.  No exceptions.
