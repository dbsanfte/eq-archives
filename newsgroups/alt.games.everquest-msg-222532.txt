You can if the vast majority of players used that zone. And that is what 
a 'norm'al player would experience these days.

Well... except for the hordes of 65ths farming the high end game, 
flooding the bazaar with unwanted items, and deflating bazaar prices 
faster than SoE can make expansions.

But sure, they weren't helping you personally.... Unless you count 
paying you heavily inflated prices for trivial amounts of easy effort 
simply because they are "that rich", and they can make 400+ pp or more 
in a 60 ldon adventure or lake rathe or whatever... so its no skin off 
their butt.

You are sort of like a McDonalds charging 100 bucks for a big mac 
because your located inside a big execs office... sure he can get it for 
a buck like everyone else, but the time it would take to take the 
elevator down from the 70th floor, or even buzz his secretary would cost 
him more than hundred he saved.

The first dollar was completely honest... the other 99 were honest too, 
but don't kid yourself... they are completely divorced from the business 
model of making big macs, and subsist entirely on exploiting relative 
economic efficiencies imposed upon the very rich.
