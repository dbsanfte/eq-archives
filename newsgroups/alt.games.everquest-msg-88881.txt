Well everything depends. I find Necromancers easier to play than mages. If
you have Luclin, then faction isn't much of a problem. Can you choose Cazic
Thule as a deity if you're a DE? If so you could easily raise your faction
in Paineel and train and bank there if you needed.

The mana regen and healing abilities of the Necro are great, though the Mage
does get better pets and better nukes.
