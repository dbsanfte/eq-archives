If you wanted to have a bazaar trader and do some heavy duty tradeskilling,
especially more than one skill, it would have been exceptionally difficult
to do that without passing items off to store on a mule.  Hell, I didn't
have a bazaar trader, I just had a character that was getting into 4
tradeskills (it's often advantageous to master another one or two skills to
make subcombines for the one skill you're really interested in) and I had to
pass off items to a mule just to ensure that my main would have open bag
slots for items acquired in regular hunting.

Before the shared bank slots, I either had to find a friend to hold the
items anytime I wanted to transfer them between characters, or I had to use
a tradeskill container to hold the items while I logged off my main and
logged in my mule.  In either of those situations, there were potential
hazards.  My friend could decide to simply keep the items for himself (if
he's not as trustworthy as I thought he was, although some people actually
used people they didn't actually know to do this, which blows my mind) or
someone could discover my items in the tradeskill container before I got
there, and swiped them himself.

In the former case, where my friend took my items, not only would that leave
me immensely pissed off, a situation SOE would not like having (they'd
prefer that I enjoy my time playing),  I'd also very likely petition a GM to
get my items back, which requires SOE employees to spend their time sorting
out this issue and trying to find an appropriate resolution to it;  this is
also a situation SOE would like to avoid.

This does not simply involve tradeskill items either.  If I have a bazaar
mule, I'd have to pass along my saleables in the same fashion: items that
might be very valuable and very prone to someone running off with them.

Plus, even if nothing goes bad, it can still be a pain in the ass, since it
requires two people to work out this possibly convoluted scheme of logging
out and in and hanging around in a spot for the mule to show, which, if
someone loses a connection or has to go or whatever, could just make things
more difficult than they have to be.  (And might also result in a petition
if the original party doesn't believe that it was an innocent, unfortunate
linkdeath on the part of the item holder)  This holds up two people who'd
probably be more interested playing than doing this crap.

Plus, all of this applies as well to twinking.  I can't count the number of
times I saw someone get ripped off by trusting the wrong person with an
item.  How many SOE Message of the Days did we see devoted to this issue?

So they came up with the shared slots, and these problems ended.
