I've been having a problem for awhile now.  Anytime I'm indoors fighting I
get major lag. Sometimes it'll be a minute between casting (pushing the key)
and having the spell take place. Meanwhile my buddies are still fighting and
have probably killed whatever it was by the time I catch up. My modem speed
is a fairly constant 53,333.  I have a Geforce2 GTS video card and I run at
the 1028 X 714(?) screen size.  I have a SB Live sound card.  Outside is no
problem.  Any ideas?

David
