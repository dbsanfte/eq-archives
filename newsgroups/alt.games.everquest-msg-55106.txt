Then I guess you're not familar with mindspring's Accecptable Use Policy
(AUP) that you agreed to.

2d. Harassment. Using the Services to transmit any material (by email,
uploading, posting, or otherwise) that harasses another.

2m. News. EarthLink Members should use their best judgment when posting to
any newsgroup. Many groups have charters, published guidelines, FAQs, or
"community standards" describing what is and is not considered appropriate.
Usenet can be a valuable resource if used properly. The continued posting of
off-topic articles is prohibited. Commercial advertisements are off-topic in
most newsgroups, especially regional groups not specifically named for such.
The presence of such articles in a group is not indicative of the group's
"intended" use. Please familiarize yourself with basic Usenet netiquette
before posting to a newsgroup.

Quite the hypocrit I see... Thanks for the contributions!
