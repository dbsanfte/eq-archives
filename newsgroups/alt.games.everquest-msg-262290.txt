After the first couple weeks of LDoN I stopped hearing anyone worry 
about the leaderboard, a loss doesn't cost any exp or LDoN points or 
faction or anything, just points on a board that AFAIK noone even looks at.

Contrawise, those folks might end up with free points, if you manage a 
success or even a partial success.  Given the degree to which some 
people are twinked and buffed, and the comparative ease of the lower 
level "normal" missions, success isn't beyond possibility.

Too, you could deliberately find two people 7 levels lower than you to 
form the group, this should put your average level down low enough that 
you'll get a normal for 5 levels below you more or less, instead of the 
normal you'd get with two people your own level (or two people 7 levels 
higher than you)  Chances of success, and of soloing in general, should 
be better that way.
