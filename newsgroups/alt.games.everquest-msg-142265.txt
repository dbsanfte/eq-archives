As a rogue, with sneak, i'd never even worry about faction again until the
day I got into velious quest armour groups.. and even then, only when
absolutely needed.

I had to get warmly or so with King Tormax to hand him the dorf kings head
(which is ironic in that im ally to dorfs, max kos to giants).. rather than
hand heads into the Kromriff Recruiter (to raise riff and zek) I just ran
through the zone to the bank (invis would work) then get behind Captain
bvellos (who was kos) and sneak/hand him heads (which raises Tormax + Zek)
