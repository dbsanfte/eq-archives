 What I know is that Verant screwed us once again.

 If there are zones the soloers will be leaving, you can bet the
groupers will be leaving as well since the XP is even slower grouped (in
most cases). 

 People need to look past the "Ha, no solo for you!" and see that it
affects everyone, unless they are hunting mobs 51+. Now, count how many
51+ zones are and divide by the number of level 60 people. On paper it's
not sounding too pretty to me.
