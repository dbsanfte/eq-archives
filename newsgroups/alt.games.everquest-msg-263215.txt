I don't see the gaming industry selling any aspects of a particular title 
before they ever begin writing the code. That's the drama to which I was 
referring. 

We're not investors. We don't stand to make money on the deal. We won't 
finance it up front. Let me rephrase that. Anyone who *would* purchase a 
game or any right of play before any code is written would be a total 
moron.
