Aye, I agree with you.  In EQ the zones were so huge you were usually
a long way from safety, and dying in EQ used to be (not now) a hell of
a big deal.  The corpse runs across maybe two or three zones, with no
armour, gear, money or weapons at lowbie level (at level 5 when I
first played, if I recall correctly), no PoK stones... what a
nightmare!  Especially if you were in a zone you'd never seen before
or which was dark and misty - I'll never forget Nektulos forest corpse
runs  :D  

"Did I die beside that tree... looks familiar... damn, not that one!
That one maybe?  Oh s**t, there's an undead behind it.... aw crap!
ANOTHER corpse in the damn zone now!!  That makes FIVE now, and I keep
finding the ones with no gear on them!!"

I was duoing with a female player (a nice woman I knew) and I took her
into Southern Karana, near Splitpaw, and she told me she was shaking
with fear  :D  A bit over the top, maybe, but I knew where she was
coming from  :) 

There's no fear involved in WoW.  Died?  Everything's fine a few
seconds later.
