Greetings,

I have had extream packetloss at a friends house.  Could be a few things.
1 check with the maker of your motherboard and get the most current drivers
for you usb hub.
2.  If that has no effect make sure you have your usb modem pluged in
directly to the computer .  No usb hub router they are a pain.
3. Try to replace the cable connection for the usb port I know that one
sounds strange but I have seen more bad cables then anything else.
4.  Best choice is to dump the usb and use a pci nic.  Be warry about
putting into the slot under the agp card.  That will automaticly share a irq
with the video card.  Use another one.  Also when going pci do yourself a
favor and make sure you get a plenum Cat5 cable.  Yes they do cost about 3
bucks more but are worth it in the long one.
5. @home and multi pc setup its only 5 bucks an a ip.  not really that bad .
Have 4 computers all setup with there own ip account including a tivo ..:)
Good luck
