There's something odd about the bazaar.  I'll position myself in a 
perfectly good spot, right up against the edge of the bazaar floor in 
the back, not on top of or even near anybody, then I'll log on my other 
account to hand some stuff to the trader.  I'll run back to where she 
is, and about 90% of the time, the trader is two feet to the left of 
where I stood her - often standing on top of another person, or halfway 
up one of those !@#$ poles.  I actually felt bad when I discovered this, 
because I had someone bitch me out for standing on top of them and I 
bitched them out back because, looking at it from my trader, I was 
standing beside and away from her, but it's quite likely I was right in 
front of her in reality.
