How did the WS ranger mess up?   Wiping at 99% (if i read that right?) =
Yuck! :p
We never used a WS ranger, never saw the need for it (and the less steps
involved, the less chance of screwup!)

You know where Emp pops, position the raid so MA and rampage tank are the 2
nearest to him, everybody else just stand a little back behind.  Im assuming
you fought emp in the opposite corner to where you're jail crew is at?

We never have problems with people in Jail crew, they are totally
self-sufficient so nobody goes near them.  Makes it much less complicated
for jails crew to keep tabs on their mobs when they aren't crowded by others

Nobody kills him in a spot that you can BS.  Thats just one thing you have
to accept with Emp really.    You can get a decent side view to stop eating
a ton of ripostes, but not long and clear views of his back.
