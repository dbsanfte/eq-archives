It's a real PITA since Verant overhauled Befallen.  Now you've got a 
dungeon full of dark elf casters and their damn pets so, if you're 
camping Gynok, you won't get much rest between swatting the ones who 
agro on you and helping out unsuspecting young'uns who've got into 
trouble.

Gynok is still spawning in the normal way however.  My routine is to 
keep the top floor cleared, and kill all the PH spawns, which tend to 
be Icebone Skelleton,  Putrid Skelleton, Giant Rat, Ghoul, Plague Rat, 
Large Skelleton.

Eventually Gynok will spawn.  However, he doesn't drop the Platinum 
ring every time either.  I've killed him three times in a row and only 
got a copper ring....which is highly frustrating.
