A Druid is pardon the expression a Hybrid of all pure classes without any
hybrid penalties. They can Buff, Heal, Dot, Nuke, Port, and to some extent
crowd control. True the are most effective outside and with animals. A Druid
is designed to be a Soloing class same as a Mage or Necro but a little more
group friendly.
