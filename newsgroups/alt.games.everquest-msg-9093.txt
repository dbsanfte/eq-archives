You are 100% Correct , but over look one simple point, thats the game , you
kill things to get items and exp. you round around the world and talk to
people . and thats about it. Thats the game dude. This game is like most
games out there. So if thats not good enought , look around for a game that
is more fun to play for you: I like the close combat games from SSI , Panzer
general are kind of fun too...another game that I like for little fast
action is Delta force ( but its all Quake like Killing)
