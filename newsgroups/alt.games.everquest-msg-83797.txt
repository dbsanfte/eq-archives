OK, I paraphrased, but how about from your own postings?

What DOES burn me, though, is to see a lvl 50 or so with an OBVIOUS
violation, and the GM says that he's going to let it slide since the
guy kept it so long. I KNOW this would not be approved of by the GM's
bosses...

Wolverene's a tough one to nail. I've had a couple GM's inform me that
"that is the name of a rather ill-tempered furry animal, too. Maybe
that's where he got the name". Yeah, wearing bronze and lambent and
dual wielding claws, I'm sure.

I was rather disappointed when a few GMs had no clue where the name
"Ktulu" came from...

I'm not trying to get into a pissing match with you, I am trying to 
convince you that you (along with the rest of us) make wildly inconsistant 
statements.  Your own postings are full of references to the naming RULES, 
yet when someone brings up obvious and clear-cut violations, you start 
referring to them as GUIDELINES.  
You rail against GMs who don't get the references that offend you, but 
then in the same breath try to say that obscure violations are fine.  
Obscurity is always relative.
