Well I am mainly thinking about crowded zones and RAIDs.  RAIDS can be a
real bitch to configure in EQ because I always have to go through the
routine of turning things down or completely off just so the lag is
manageable.  I know the problem is not completely with the client screaming
for info from the server but when you have over 40 other players whose
actions and locations are having to be shot down from the server it seems
that if it was optimized for a broadband type of connection then things
would run more smoothly.
