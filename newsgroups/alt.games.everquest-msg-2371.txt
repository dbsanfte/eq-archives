Your hands down, perhaps.  If you check Castersrealm boards most people will
agree that until iksars get themselves a JBB, trolls will remain the best
shaman race.  The few extra points of wisdom that being an iksar grants you
is pretty easily compensated for with gear and higher HP of a troll.  You
can't make up for a free DD, though.

Plus I have an iksar monk and it sucks not being able to shop/bank anywhere.

iksar)
