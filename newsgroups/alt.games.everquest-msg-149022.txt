Not even close, they are used in multiple tradeskills now, and have been for
a while.  They go for around 2k each to players, and I am not talking about
Jewelers.  It is actually not very cost effective to make BD resist gear
anymore, as the gear does not sell for enough to make up for the cost of the
BD.  YMMV.
