After getting a little way into level 53 with my druid, I decided to try my
hand at the planes.  I was praticing charming in JP Forest, and got the hang
of it and now I am trying to move to the majors.  Here is where i stand.

After about 5 attempts in the PoD.. running like a little girl and gating
out everytime, i managed to kill a fly.  After a few more attempts life is
going pretty well.  I found that keeping my steins will boost my Cha up to
105, and that helped a lot with the charm lasting.

So after about half a yellow, I am getting pretty comfortable.  Even managed
to kill a yellow con.. larve of some kind.  The problem that I am having is
pulling.    I am not doing all that well with single pulling.. even with my
harmony of nature.  I end up parking one, pet tanks other.  That works well,
until charm wears off and then I have 2-3 not so friendly mobs chasing me
around.

So.. any tips...  how many spawn there.. right by entrance.. are they static
spawns... etc...
