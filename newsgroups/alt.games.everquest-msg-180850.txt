<www.eqtraders.com/quests/quests.htm> is your best friend.  Look up the 
progressive pottery quest, it's a big PITA farming the stupid worms for 
nodrop blood and bile (hint, if you want to finish you need around a 
stack of each) but you get some nice WR jars(aka bags) out of it.  Also 
look at the whole of the Bard quest and the Sonic Wolfbane weapons 
quest.  Make sure you don't throw away something you need later on. 
(done that alot)

Have fun and good luck.
