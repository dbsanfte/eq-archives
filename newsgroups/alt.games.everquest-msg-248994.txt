 ..... the fact that Amazon lists a 9/15 ship date, or the fact that there
are already 39 customer reviews for a product that's nowhere near release.

Taking into account that some of the reviews are going to be from people
associated with the development of the product ("This game is great!  You
should buy it as soon as it hits the shelves!"), and some are from people
with axes to grind and have no better outlet ("SOE sucks.  EQ sucks.  Stay
away from this game as if it were the plague."), that leaves a large section
of the 'reviews' to be general discussion/opinion.

The shitstorm that's brewing around this launch is of epic proportion.  If
SOE doesn't live up to Cryptic's launch of CoH, bad things will happen to
the people who have their own offices in the hallowed halls of Sony Online
Entertainment.
