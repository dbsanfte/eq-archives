<snip a shedload of stuffs>

One thing that pisses me off about enchanters, mezzing mobs on top of other
mobs, as a ranged attack user, this is very annoying, having to go into a
less DPS mode sucks.  Generally I will try to snare adds away from MT, for
them then to be mezzed.

Yes..with communication.  They carry on doing it, I just shoot away :)

There was a reply to this on the cruicible that I thought was pretty good,
lemme see if I can find it.....

From this thread:

"We need to go back to the time *before* someone invited said enchanter to
enter the group.

First, when lots of mobs showed up, contrary to popular opinion, we didn't
all take an instant trip to our bind point. That's right, we all pulled
tricks out of our collective bags, and engaged in crowd control.

The bard mezzed things, or off tanked them, or charmed them, or (in rare
cases where it was safe to do so) sent them back to their bind point.

The mage, after taking that one nasty hit, brought his pet over and taught
that mob what-for. The mage pet often gets the mob dead or near dead before
I've made it there to slow it.

The wizard stunned the mob and rooted it off into a corner. Or maybe the
wizard and the mage are engaging in some AoE fun.

The not main assist melee class? She's off taking down the mob. I helped her
out with a slow, and she's doing fine.

The necro used a pet, or rooted, or FD'd the agro onto a tank.

The shaman? She's rooting, or root tossing, or aoe slowing, or single target
slowing, or healing that wizard, or just drawing agro away from other
classes while they get a handle on things.

We all did something more than stand and cry "It's hitting me! It's hitting
me! Make it stop!"

The point is, BE, that's Before Enchanter, we had all sorts of ways to deal
with multiple pulls and adds. And these ways were fun. They involved using
different skills, taking chances, and the added spice to the game.

Then this mouthy enchanter showed up. Yeah yeah yeah. As you point out, the
Main Assist approach to taking down mobs tactic is basic. At this point it
is even easy. What it is not is all that terribly interesting or fun. That
is, unless you are the enchanter. The enchanter has some excitement in
getting things under control. For the rest of the group it's just a dull
grind. Perhaps even a safe *shudders* dull grind.

While the enchanter plays prima donna, the rest of the classes are expected
to croon softly in the background, pretending that they don't know the main
harmonies, and lack the music for the tune called "crowd control."

I've been playing this game a long time, and I do not need to practice my
"main assist" basic level tactics. When the mobs hit hard enough or fast
enough that it matters, we can go back to playing that way.

But for mobs that do not (summon), and there are quite a few that do not, I
refuse to just stand there watching them stand in a drooling line, waiting
for the main assist to get to them. There is just no need for it.

The group is more efficient at killing if I'm dotting something that no one
else is hitting.

To that end, after you've cast your mez, and I've slowed all the mezees, I'm
going to pick one, send it flying through the air with virulent paralysis,
and dot it.

Dot it several times actually. Might even stick me dogpack on it, and if I'm
bored, go hit it meself. And if you're being hit by it, then MOVE. Because I
guarantee that I can hold the agro if you do. (In fact, I'll hit my hotkey
if you like. %T is now rooted and rotting. Attack something else, %T is
mine. If you're being hit MOVE.)

If I'm feeling particularly manaful, I'll grab another and root it off too.

My dots are made for a slow fight. And there are all these tasty mobs here
just waiting in line? And I'm supposed to just stand and watch you make
things glow? *rolls her eyes*

Yeah, that was me breaking your mez. I have to do that before Dogdog can.

At bottom, this EQ thing is a game. And I play games to have fun. As do the
other 4 members of that group who grabbed a pick up enchanter and got a god
complex instead.
