Two of my buddies were duoing in Everfrost the other night and one of them
died due to Mammoth adds ( as the story was related to me ).  Xalb was
telling me that Xhi went unconscious and then bled to death from a Dot from
a dry-bone or something.  I asked him it he tried to use his Stein to heal
him.  He didnt' think of it, which I can appreciate, as I've never once
thought of using those 3 charges of puny healing before.  I doubt it would
have saved him, though.

Anyhoo, after that, I finished my Pyzjn camp and decided to head to
everfrost.  On the way there, I wanted to check out Blackburrow, since I've
never hunted there.  I cast lev and jumped down the tree.  I didn't pull out
my maps, and just wandered around for a while in that nightmare and came
across a level 5 guy down in the bottom.

I tell him that I can invis him if he joins my group.  He says "I can't
leave my group right now."  Ok, fine with me, if he wants to chance dyin'.
So, I follow him around a little and sure enough, he gets jumped by 3
Gnolls.  He's down the 50% in no time so I nuke 1, nuke another and then
right as he hits the pavement, I nuke the 3rd.  He says "thanks" and I tell
him I can't heal him, sorry.  Then the Stein comes to mind!  Woo-hoo!
Someone whom the stein will actually help.  I target him, and heal him 3
times ( he's then at about 75% health ).  He says thanks and walks off.  I
follow him some more and he stops, staring at a few gnolls.  Then, he
charges one and it looks like he might actually win, until 2 adds come by
and thump him.  Poor kid.

I can't figure out what was so important about his group that he didn't want
a safe way out.  I think I would prefer to get out safely and regroup later
than to get thumped like that and worry about a CR.
