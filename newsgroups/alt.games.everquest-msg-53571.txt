Though you may feel good now, I don't think you'll get the desired
satisfaction from your petition. You want this guy gone, but all a name
petition will do is make the guy change his name. If he refuses, the GM will
change his name for him.I hope you remember what he looked like, so you can
watch for him in the future.

>>>we petitioned that he was KSing and got one of our members  .......
Nothing happened that we could see.<<<

A GM has to actually *see* the KSing before they will do anything. If you
send a petition, a GM will show up (invis most the time), but if the guy
doesn't KS while the GM is there, there is nothing he will do.

What you need to do is get him to admit that:
1) He knows he's KSing.
2) He claims he'll keep doing it.

Then you /report, /petition. That's the best way to deal with a jerk like
that.
