I think there's a burgeoning misunderstanding regarding this whole
"reward" issue.  Sony is *not* rewarding flagged individuals simply
for being flagged.  They are attempting to compensate players for time
lost due to hours and days attempting to be flagged, where others no
longer have to go through that mess.  The only time lost on their part
is running up to the zone in and waiting through "LOADING, PLEASE
WAIT...".
