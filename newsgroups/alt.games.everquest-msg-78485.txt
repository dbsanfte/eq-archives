You have no class icon on the screen because one doesn't exist at this
time - and may not ever. The "coming soon" new GUI may not show them
for any class.

As for the claw quest, it's true that the first set of claws isn't
anything special, but the quest leads to new quests to upgrade the
claws, somewhat like the Iksar SK weapon quests.
