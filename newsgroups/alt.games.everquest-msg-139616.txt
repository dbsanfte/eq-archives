Besides monk PL?  Why screw yourself like that?  Monk PL is probably the
best PL there is for a 25+ *anything with root and no hp*.

Enchanter works, but is hardly PL'ing as such, as most of what the enchanter
could do you could just pay some passing enchanter for.

I PL'ed my wizard from level 25 to 45 using my monk.  It went nice and quick
and was mostly all done in a single zone (OT).  I then PL'ed the wiz from
45 to 51 using my magician (as in, I soloed with the magician, and left the
wiz sitting in a safe spot doing absolutely nothing except receiving the
split loot and exp).

I may have the only alteration-specced 50+ wizard in existence.  :)
