As a bit of an aside , I am grouping with my Pally friend at the momment in SK
He is 30 pally I am 28 warrior, I taunt as my str and ac and hp of course are 
much higher

Anyway, we began to allow him to taunt when I was at about 2 bubs and about to 
go berserk if it was a hard pull like a yellow Avocet (which hit hard I found)


Interesting result was he took a few hits but I began to cut chunks out of the 
beast and end result was less healing for him to do on me (or himself)

We tried it earlier than 2 bubs and low and behold it was 'easier' if he 
taunted earlier and I cut the beast to pieces.

Comments welcome

S.
