In that case, I guess it's good I never claimed that.

He has BAD evidence.

WoW during open public beta != WoW after it's been released a while.

What part of that is hard to understand?  Hasn't the Stromm server
taught us anything?  Please, please don't make me dig up old a.g.e
posts where people were complaining about the kill stealing, camp
stealing, and otherwise very bad and antisocial behavior on Stromm,
which later cleared up.

And, yes, I fully realize, admit, and understand I'm guessing, too, I
just think my guess is better thought out.
