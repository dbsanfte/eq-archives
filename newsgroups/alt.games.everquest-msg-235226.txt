Shrug, I thought poopin nuggets was funny. in 3 months I will be 24. if you
wanna label me as a child because I have a sense of humor, go right ahead.
That is probably the least offensive thing someone can call me, a kid. I
really pray that I never get so bitter and take things so personally as some
of you "adults" do.


btw I didnt see a problem with biill either. too many of you guys think you
are the naming police or something and you have to go around judging
everyone. just play the game and quit looking for reasons to be upset.


the others I agree with cause they are clearly breaking a rule of some kind
or another. be it (recently enlightened on the matter) 'name infringement on
a cartoon char or copyrighted name' or vulgarity.
