Wrong.

No it isn't. Why do you tink Cops carry guns? Wouldnt' their billy
clubs be more useful? And what if they perp has a gun? What do you do
then, tough-guy? And what if you aren't home. What does dear ole mum
do then? 

If she's practiced with a pistol or a good shotgun, I'll tell you what
she does... She survives relatively unmolested.

You should always

AND

shotgun. Both severely limit overpenetration.

Ohhh! So you want to feel the other guy's head crush. how antisocial
of you!

Me? I don't get off on hurting others. I just want them to stop trying
to hurt me & my loved ones. I guess that's where we differ. You're
still into the thugganomics of it all.

>
>It seems you have problems with women.

Really? How so? I want them to be able to defend themselves. Can you
say the same? Oh no... you're too busy fantasizing about caving in
someone's skull and playing the big man.

>  It looks like either you hate them

Nope, love 'em. Well, except for a particular few, but that's another
story for another time.

>or resent them.  I'm not sure which.  Last time I looked, a pussy was a

Not when it's trying to be a man.

>
>Oh, and I never did resort to the name-calling that you seem to get off on.

Hey, a pussy's a pussy. And I'm looking at one right now. When you're
man enough to admit that you harbor dangerous attitudes about
self-defence, maybe you'll have gorwn out of being a pussy. I
certainly hope so for your loved-ones sake. Till then, I call a rose a
rose and a pussy a pussy.

>However, I will now say that you are a narrow-minded, hate-filled bigot 

Bigot? Hmmm... you got me there, I can't stand pussies. They make me
feel ashamed of my gender.

>that
>seems to get off on spreading lies intended to distort the truth 

Can you name a "distortion" I've stated? I said that you'd rather see
your mom raped & strangled by her own pantyhose than to be able to
defend herself. By depriving her of the most effective means of self
defense available to ANYONE, that's exactly what you've done. At least
in your mind. If it were up to you, this nation (The USA, just in case
you're not 'Merican) would still be a BC. 

>to your own

>ridicule would be fun, too).

Heh, I'm not sad at all. I'm a self confident human being who doesn't
fantasize about pulped bloody brains under my fingernails. Maybe
someday you can evolve enough to join me.
