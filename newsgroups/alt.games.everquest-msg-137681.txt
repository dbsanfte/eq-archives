Can you not see the flaw in this argument?

What rules are you talking about, that deal
specifically with theft. I'd like to read them
before I make a comment.

On the contrary, it is you who appears to be fuzzy
about the meaning of the word 'ownership'.

You assign arbitrary meanings to it as suits your
whim.

What sort of ownership is it, where it can be
taken away from you without reason. Where it can
modified without permission. Where you have no
legal rights concerning it.

You keep saying this, but just because you have
some control over the items does not mean you own
them.

You might like to work on the concept of
ownership, and what it means.

And yet, there is.

You may well think that. You may also think that
you have built your argument on sandy ground.
