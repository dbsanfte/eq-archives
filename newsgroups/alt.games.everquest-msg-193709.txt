Haven't played an SK at all, nor a Ranger beyond 20 (yet), but for
Paladin at least mana is worth quite a bit.  Keep in mind that the
advantage an SK or Paladin has over a Warrior in terms of solo play
comes from spells (after all, we do less damage and have lower AC
and fewer HP).  For a Paladin the difference between KEI and no KEI
in terms of solo experience is better than 2:1.  When soloing in my
30s having Clarity meant that I killed a little faster and never
died (nowadays I doubt I'd die even without, gear is better and SoW
potions rule for solo outdoors, but KEI would speed the kills by
eliminating downtime).  In a group, any mana regen buff is a good
thing, the more and bigger the better if facing casters (c2 was
barely enough for constant combat at chef/bar in Old Sebilis, I
was having to watch/manage mana carefully until a Necro joined and
started twitching the Cleric, Enchanter, and I).
