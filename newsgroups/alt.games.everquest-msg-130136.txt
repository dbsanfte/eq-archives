wow, i can't even keep track on you guys anymore. your running so
fast. i'm going to sleep and when i wake up, your like 400 posts more,
and then i need to search again. that's too muc even for me, i like
reading some of you posts, but that's too much even for me. so i'm
just going to end this post with saying to you all:


some of you impressed me with your wished amd mature thinking, some of
you(and there warnet many of you) make me wanna just go to some
mountien and be all alone for the rest of my life, and just forget
about everything, cause some of the things you wrote(and you know who
i you are).

so i'm just gonna say, you don't my counry the way you think you do. i
live here all my life, and i feel froud of what myt country have come
to in just 53 years.

to all of you, you say so much stuff, but unless you are living in my
country, you don't know a thing. so stop assuming it all. i don;t
assum about your country cause i have no idea what's going on(wall
more pearsonly, i ear stuff on TV, but who doesnt?).

too all you big mouthed, come live here for a year, and see everything
first hand.

i'll say this again, my country is not a all good, but what country
is? every country had/has it's bad moments, but each country gut out
of it(and i'm sure most of them did it in a very harmfull bad way).

that's pretty much all i'm gonna say.
