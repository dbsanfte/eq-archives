Hey all.
 
Its been a year and a half since I played. Sony has recognized my
addiction and emailed me to play for 30 days free. Okay fine.
 
I think the reason I left the game was because I was always bouncing
between the 640X480 res screen with the menus and full 1024X768
screen. I just hate playing at 640X480. 
 
My question is, did they ever fix this??  
 
I'd go in and play to find out, but for some reason my old name/pass
are'nt working. I gotta wait until Monday to speak to someone at Sony
for some answers. I hope my characters still live. :)
 
Thanks.
