    After going through several possible duos, my husband
and I have decided to go evil.  I'm going to be a DE Wizard 
(ports, high int to do trade skills, good nuking action,
 but mostly ports) and Steven, AKA "Lenny", is going to be 
an Ogre Shaman (Sow, healing, DoTs, and hopefully fairly 
decent tanking ability, though we know we're going to be lacking
in this respect).  We're thinking that this might be a pretty fun 
combo to play, and also that our abilities might come in handy to
the other evils.
   I'm am going to RP evil.  No, doesn't mean I'm going to KS or 
anything like that.  My character is simply going to wish that
everyone besides herself was dead.  She'll tolerate Lenny because
he'll be easy to manipulate (in game, not RL, people) and helps
her in her goal of killing things.  She'll group with and help
other evils to extent that it will help her kill things.  Her
idea of a good day would to be kill all the MoBs in the zone,
then all the PCs except for her party, then her party, except
for Lenny, then Lenny.  Of course, a zone will never run out
of MoBs, so she'll never success in really killing everyone.
I'll not play her in a way to actually intentionally endanger
the party, but will /em various things to indicate my
homicidal inclinations.  Lenny is going to role-play sorta
evil; a dumb ogre that hangs around me because I help him
kill things he can eat.  
    Haven't decided on a name yet.  Teaevil maybe, Teamean,
Teanuke, or Tearuin.  Of those, I'm leaning towards the 
last.  Lenny, of course, will shout for "Lenny".  Maybe 
he'll even get it.
