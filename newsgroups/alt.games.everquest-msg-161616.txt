I'm spending a lot of time in PoN recently in one camp or
another.  Its just a more attractive zone for me than the other
tier ones, and I seem to get the same exp in any of them.

At any rate, the one thing that bugs me about PoN is the constant
non stop whining and shouting about people training the
Graveyard.

1) people shouldn't train the graveyard, I agree.

2) people almost never train the graveyard.  They train to the
exit, which happens to be located near the graveyard.

If you are sitting there in the middle of the graveyard, hanging
out because you just got a rez or thats where you zoned in, or
because there's an exit nearby in case of trouble, and someone
comes running to exit with crap on thier tails, you are suddenly
going to look like a handy snack, there's no doubt about that.

Simple solution: go up the hill when you zone in.  When you get a
rez, loot up and go up the hill.  Never hang out in the
graveyard.

This means there's about 30 seconds per incedent where you are at
risk of train; when you first zone in, and when you get a rez.
Cleric should look around to see if its basically clear before
rezing you, that cuts that risk down some, and your eyes have to
be open when you arrive, that cuts that risk down some.

Invis when possible also cuts the risk, you have to train quite a
ways to get see invis mobs over there.

I'll tell you one thing that isn't going to help, though, and
thats using /ooc or /shout in an attempt to get people to stop
training the exit.

I'm reasonably considerate, but I"M not going to stop.  That zone
line is the difference between living and dying sometimes, for
me, and dying means losing all my buffs, all my mana, and... well
an imperceptable bit of exp.  I'm not going to politely die out
there somewhere to save some people to dim witted to not hang out
on the train tracks.  I'll shout train warning, I'll be sure to
approach as much away from the GY as I can and click that exit as
quickly as I can in order to hopefully not get the mobs quite so
close... but I'm not going to die for you.

Figure the average person is less "heroic" than that, and at
least a quarter of the population will deliberately train the GY
first in order to maybe lose the mobs without having to zone
out.  Figure the yelling will influence the behavior of perhaps
one person in ten (a generous estimate)

Figure that the one person who's behavior you can be 100% certain
of changing is your own.

GET OFF THE TRAIN TRACKS
