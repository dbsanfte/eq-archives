Greetings,

Just purchased a 2ghz P4 512 megs RAM, Geforce 2 64 meg, SB Live! 5.1, Win
XP

While the sound effects sound great the music seems to skip...wondering if
anyone else has this problem..I'm thinking it is due to Win XP and SB Live!
conflict or something...but not sure..

I don't listen to the music usually anyway but on a new 1500 dollar system
one kind of wants things to work =)

If you have this problem and it doesn't annoy you...just go into Rivervale
for about 15 minutes it will drive you mad!

Thanks for any help you can provide!
