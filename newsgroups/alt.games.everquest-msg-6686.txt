I guess I just must be lucky.  Twice last week I ran with my level 8 DE
Enchanter to HHK from Neriak.  I didn't invis either and ran down the trail
at 8 am with no problems.  Don't ask why I had to go twice, I should just
learn to pay attention to what I buy. :)  Maybe I was having a "blonde
moment."
