Yeah, but information on exactly where to find the mobs is scarce there.
It's not like I can track them down.  I need to know the specific spawn
location that I need to clear out, if there is one.  That information is
buried in the thread at the safehouse.  I have found that Allakhazam's tends
to lag behind a fair amount on mob information.
