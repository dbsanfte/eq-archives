    People learn by doing. In most "PL" situations like you're going to 
describe, the person being PL'ed does very little "doing" and a lot of 
"watching".

    Likewise, a soldier standing on the deck of a battleship learns very 
little about armed combat as the battleship destroys his foes at a distance. 
You seem to be describing people of similar, but different levels grouping - 
a mechanic that is in current MMORPGs.

    Assuming they survive, I think whichever group spends more time fighting 
will learn more. As another poster pointed out, the tricks that a combat 
veteran could impart on a green soldier are most like the advice a veteran 
player could tell a new player. They help make a player better, but they 
don't mean squat until put to practice learning how things really are.

    The idiocy is in the analogy. You're taking players of such different 
levels that they cannot group together, and assuming that they would use the 
exact same methods to achieve victory so the greener person can learn from 
the veteran. A young wizard would learn nothing from a quadding wizard given 
that the young wizard can't snare. A young cleric would learn nothing from a 
veteran cleric given the vet is using a method, CH healing, that the 
youngster cannot replicate. To use your warfare analogy, a guy with a rifle 
isn't going to learn how to be better with his rifle by watching the company 
machinegunner mow down enemies - nor will he learn by being on the deck of 
that battleship.
