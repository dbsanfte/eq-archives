Bah. I'm still holding out for an elaborate kitchen knife (bad luck
with reavers), but I do have a set of claws and a whip. Since I still
wear black leather, people occasionally have to ask what class I am :)

Anyway, for the original poster: don't worry about 2hb since you'll
want to have something in your other hand, and work on both the other
skills at your leisure. I had all 3 melee skills to 125 around level
40 just for the heck of it and then stopped doing 2hb and 1hs, since
my 1hb had stats. By occasionally swinging, and by finishing off mobs
with melee when I soloed, I had maxed 1hb by level 50. At 56, I
usually hold a 1hs whip since it looks better than an oversized
hammer, and from swinging it on occasion, my 1hs is now 170.
So, if you want to have melee skills, just swing a little now and
then, keep a FS or velium scimitar or something like that around just
to work on 1hs if you want to (1hb's have stats so they're more common
among druids), chuck a few training points in it if you want to, but
don't feel forced to work on them. And if you DO want to melee, learn
when and when not to do it. (You don't want to draw aggro, you don't
want to forget your main job, which is spellcasting, and you might
want to learn to sit down and med during the delay between swings even
if it means sitting, standing and pressing the attack key a lot)
