I have another character who is a 50 cleric, without a screwball name.  I
play him to what I think the role of a cleric should be, I try to help out
people when I'm just passing by, if there is a body just laying there, I do
a /who all <name> to see if the guy is online and would like a res.  This is
the way I play my cleric as these are the little things that I also like
about the game, people working together.

Now in the case of my bard named 'Lionoo Meowmixlot' the name is certainly
different, but by no means has my play style changed.  I still do try to
help people out and would like to think for the most part that others come
to appreciate the things he does.

I am sure there are *alot* of people out there with at least one whacky
name, but when playing that toon doesn't mean that they are suddenly going
to be assholes and try to cause grief.  I don't agree with your inference
that people with in-game names are somehow better than those with comical
names in some fashion.

There are lots of reasons why nice people may want to have a crazy name, not
just to be a 'rule breaker' .
