Last night I went along on a small raid on MM comprised of one small
group from my fledgeling guild. We were all level-appropriate for what
we were concentrating on - wading through all the initiates and such
around the outside with thoughts of venturing inside when the
situation deemed it prudent. My hopes were high for a MM Battle Drum
at some point in the evening, being the only bard there.

We were doing fine until a massive train was caused by a couple of us
falling off a ledge into a veritable battallion of mobs, who followed
us back up. It didn't seem like so many at first, but as we ran back
to the pull spot, their numbers increased seemingly exponentially.
Result: near TPW. No biggie. We've been there before. I was bound in
Shadowhaven, so I hop all the necessary PoK ports and am back to my
rogue-dragged corpse at the zone line in fifteen minutes or so (got a
bit lost in LFay).

Anyway, I loot all but my fishing bait from my corpse and decide to
wait for the rest of the party when some "Dark Huntress" NPC popped
behind me, rooted me and proceeded to bludgeon me all about my person.
Every hit was in the triple digits, so I didn't last long. She looked
like Sinead O'Connor on a CR - no hair and no gear at all. *sigh* By
this time our cleric is nearly back and happy to rez both my corpses
for me for 35% xp recoup on each - better than a kick in the teeth, I
guess. We reassemble and decide to stay close to the zoneline, killing
blues for a while.

Sure enough, we hadn't been back at it for 10 minutes when up popped
the Dark Huntress chick again. I drew aggro long enough to fire up
Selo's and yell "RUN", before hightailing it to the zone line. I made
it out this time. "HAH! In her face!" Others were not so lucky. After
a couple minutes, one groupmate who managed to get out of aggro range
but away from the zone said that she had despawned and that it was
safe. I zone back in to drag corpses. As I am surveying the carnage
this NPC left behind, I simply drop dead, not having noticed the
wicked DOT she had laid on me as I had escaped.

Group reassembles for last round of rezzes and condolences before
departing, beaten and with less xp than that with which we started -
any illusions of obtaining my MM Battle Drum gone.

This wench just went straight to the top of my "Obnoxious Mobs on whom
I Shall Exact Sweet Revenge when I'm Uber" list with a bullet. >:(
