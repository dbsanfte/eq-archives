It is sold in Qeynos, but at the Casters guild. I think in the
Enchanters section. Don't know why Verant decided not to sell it in
the Halas Shaman guild.

Just get a caster in Qeynos to buy it for you. Kind of a pain in the
butt, but that's the quickest way to get it unless you're already near
Oasis.
