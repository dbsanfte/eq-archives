So if ya a war make armour  etc etc etc for all classes. There is always a
way to make money outside a group, if you are so llame you havent played the
game and just stant there moaning and nija looting. Hell lets just hope
people stop grouping with you. If I wa that druid in the group you were in I
just would not have buffed healed sowed etc you. Simple.

No loot, no care.
