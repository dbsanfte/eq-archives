But it's not the Titanic and there is not big gash in the side.  There
might be some doorknobs that stick.  Some of the hinges squeak.
A chef or two has no sense of taste. Some of the portals leak when
a wave hits them.  The color of your stateroom doesn't match your
particular taste.  The engine is old and sometimes shakes past a
certain RPM.  The water in the pool isn't warm enough.

And your saying Julie the cruise director, who is not
in charge of fixing the mechanics of the ship, should not design a new
shuffle board court until the other stuff works to your satisfaction?

Or would your give Julie a screwdriver and tell her to stop doing her job
and start doing something else?
