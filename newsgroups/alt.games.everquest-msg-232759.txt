And here you see what I mean kiddie Ben was proven wrong by me in a
previous thread ... stilk cannot believe the advice including others
from this ng and still wants to call me a liar o)

Killfile ... get a decent newsreader Ben although you probably don't
know how to use them.

@ndrew

BTW Ben .. kept the stats on top posting in my newsgroups for one week
(given up now bored with that) .. the results are:

alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.abit
top posts 176
bottom posts 124

alt.comp.periphs.videocards.ati
top posts 285
bottom posts 181

aus.ads.forsale.computers.new
top posts  77
bottom posts 34

aus.ads.forsale.computers.used
top posts 116
bottom posts 82

I suppose you may have found that killfile switch by now so you won't
see just how wrong you are as per usual
