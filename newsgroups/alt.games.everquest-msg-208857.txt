Can't single pull at 61, don't know yet about 62.  If you can single pull
at 55 I must be missing something significant...

I usually pull from the stairs above a room, hugging the wall to my left,
as far back as I can get and still get a clear shot.

Well, I wouldn't call it a "tower" per se, but I'm in the room at the top
of the shops where there are no spawns.  I could single pull if it weren't
for pathing...buggers have to run over to their friend, then at
me.  (I have confirmed this in that if I root one, the other ignores
me...until root breaks then they both come.../sigh).  I haven't tried
standing closer, to try to "force" straight line aggro, because two HTs
and a stun can smoosh me pretty bad.
