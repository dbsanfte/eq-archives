    None of them trivial at 250. Unless you count Crystalline Silk armour as
a Velious recipe, which it technically is. But Ice Silk, Cobalt Drake/Acrtic
Wyvern/Haze Panther/Black Panther skin/hide, and Othmir/Holgresh/Velium
Hound Fur never go trivial.

    Yak (the tradeskill guy) didn't realize at first when he made the new
Velious tradeskill items (or, indeed, many of the "new wave" tradeskill
items) that not all tradeskills had a smooth progression of skill-increasing
items that could take you to close to 200 skill. Tailoring was the worst -
tailored quivers top out in the 110's, although some oldtimers had Tailoring
up in the 150's on pre-nerf stuff. So the top-end gear added in Velious
wasn't just the "endgame" for tailoring, it was also what you had to skill
up on. Since then some bridges have been added to skill up closer to 200
(Crystalline Silk armour, Wu's, cultural), but unless you're a wood elf or
halfling then post-158 skill is a lot of time, effort, and money.

    Some other trade skills are just as tough to raise. Baking, at present,
MAY require either dragon meat or foraged cinnamon sticks (just recently put
back on the Faydark forage tables) to get to Grandmaster skill. Nobody
knows, because nobody has been able to get enough of either to raise to 200
skill from 162 or so where chocolate recipes leave off - and for ages
chocolate itself was a rarity, requiring the killing of very rare GFay
brownie spawns or hunting level 45 brownies in LFay. The difference is that
nobody cares about baking because baking doesn't make a 10 INT 10 CHA hat
like tailoring does (as one example).

    You can, if you have the cash. Heaps and heaps of cash. Small pieces of
velium sell on my server for 400 pp per stack of 20, and can be picked up
quite quickly at that price in the right places (auction in Thurg or
Velk's). Arctic Wyvern Hides and Othmir Furs can also be purchased, for tens
of pp per, in good quantities in Cobalt Scar - the quad kiters usually keep
the place as bare of spawns as humanly possible anyways. And you can fish up
the Cod for the Arctic Wyvern stuff while you auction for the hides. It's
profoundly expensive, but doable.

    Now the OTHER Velious tailoring - drake hide gear, pantherskin stuff,
ice silk armour - THAT is nuts. Foraging drake eggs is an exercise in
boredom, and given the low forage rate (one per hour approximate) even
offering 100 pp per egg doesn't get you a large stock to work with. Yew
leaves are damn-near impossible to find, given both the colouration of them
vs. the background and the tendency of Show EQ'ers to clean out all the
spawns that can be reached, leaving the remaining leaves spawned on top of
trees and in rocks. Ice Silk armour costs 1 K pp per attempt in store-bought
components, and the silks drop from level 60 plus mobs in Western Wastes -
and then not always. Oh, and the Ice Silk success rate is reportedly two or
three successes per ten attempts at 250 skill (this from my server's ONE 250
skill tailor).

    See above. If all you want to do is skill up making midling items that
almost nobody will buy anymore because of all the tailors making them to
skill up, you can buy your way up. But it'll cost you - most estimates I've
seen are in the 100 K pp range to get to grandmaster tailoring.

    Jewelcraft is actually a bit odd. Only JC, Brewing, and I *think*
Fletching allow one to vendor your way to grandmaster. Smithing requires
leather padding to get over 176 in any sane way (NOBODY will use cultural to
get to 200), and until Stonebrunt Mountains came out gathering the needed
pelts was quite time consuming. Pottery has as a limiting factor rare-drop
(and rare ground spawn) Iron Oxide as a limiting factor to get past 188,
Baking I've discussed, and we know all about Tailoring. And one has to
remember that the most sought-after pieces in Jewelcrafting are based off
mob-drop gems - Fire Opal rings (bah, Temple of Sol Ro doesn't count 8) ),
Black Sapphire gear, Blue Diamond gear, Jacinth rings, Diamond rings /
masks, Imbued Ivory earrings/necklaces. Some people want ruby veils, jasper
WIS gear, jade gear, or emerald/peridot resist gear, but the bulk of sales
are the above "rare" gems.

>trivial.

    Ayup. I know at least one Heirophant on our server quit because it was
just too much hassle. And he was doing Tailoring just for something to do
once he'd hit 60, not as a "gotta get a Shawl" project.
