Tonight was my first time since the patch that I've done much beyond
setting up my bazaar mule, and as I was poking around I discovered a
change that I don't remember seeing mentioned in the patch message:
It seems some of the terms used in item descriptions got changed.
Instead of "NO DROP" it now says "NO TRADE", and instead of "NO RENT"
it says "TEMPORARY".

Now, I'll grant that the new terms are a bit clearer (to someone who
wasn't already familiar with the old ones, that is), but it might've
been nice if they'd mentioned it.  And of course, it means all those
old screenshots on Alla, and all the old discussions in all the forums,
will now be using terms that newcomers to the game will have no chance
of understanding.

Anyway, I didn't notice any other terminology changes offhand, but if
anyone spots some, please let me know, since I'll need to update the
FAQ glossary (and probably other parts as well).
