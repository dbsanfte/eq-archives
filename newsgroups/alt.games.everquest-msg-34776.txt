Kenny there are two perspectives which have to be considered, 
but you are only looking at it from one angle. With any action there 
is the action, and the possible consequences of that action.

The first perspective is Bob saying he was going to jump you. From
that perspective it IS a threat whether or not he has the ability to carry 
it out and do any damage. The second perspective is from the object 
of that threat, in this case you. Depending upon your situation at the 
time your safety may or may not be threatened.

If a two year old child threatened to beat you up, your health would 
not be threatened. The child threatened--your health was not threatened.

If Mike Tyson threatened to beat you up, your health would be
threatened, not to mention your ears. He threatened--your health 
was threatened.
