Did you say something, Lance Berg <emporer@dejazzd.com>?

I remember that guy. He was pretty much the last big thing Celaeno ran
into. I was loitering around during the pre-dx9 part of freebie month,
mostly killing 5th anniversary stuff. Saw weird name on track in the
cauldron, and experienced the following:

[Sat Mar 20 13:25:45 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron is ahead and to
the left.
[Sat Mar 20 13:25:46 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron gnashes its wide
jaws filled with rows of deadly teeth and swims for its next meal
[Sat Mar 20 13:25:46 2004] You return to view.
[Sat Mar 20 13:25:46 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron hits YOU for 124
points of damage.
[Sat Mar 20 13:25:47 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron begins to cast a
spell.
[Sat Mar 20 13:25:47 2004] Your body is encased in stone.
[Sat Mar 20 13:25:49 2004] You can't cast spells while stunned!
[Sat Mar 20 13:26:08 2004] The stone releases your body.
[Sat Mar 20 13:26:10 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron gnashes its wide
jaws filled with rows of deadly teeth and swims for its next meal
[Sat Mar 20 13:26:10 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron hits YOU for 239
points of damage.
[Sat Mar 20 13:26:10 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron hits YOU for 201
points of damage.
[Sat Mar 20 13:26:10 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron kicks YOU for 86
points of damage.
[Sat Mar 20 13:26:12 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron hits YOU for 413
points of damage.
[Sat Mar 20 13:26:14 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron hits YOU for 413
points of damage.
[Sat Mar 20 13:26:14 2004] Praklion of the Cauldron hits YOU for 239
points of damage.
[Sat Mar 20 13:26:15 2004] You begin casting Exodus.

I have to say I really did enjoy the fact that he didn't munch on me
while I was stunned :) No, I can't remember why I waited that long to
exodus.
