I should qualify this by saying you need to be very sure what 
"not really needed" means. For me it's usually ducking out in 
the last second when the MT is at 100% or very close to it.

Also, versus mobs with spiky damage like Emp Ssra, or insane
DPS such that the MT can go down in 1 or 2 rounds, never duck.
