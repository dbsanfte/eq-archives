/gasp

Sounds a lot like my experience last night in KC. Not with a guild but with
a few guys I've been playing with the last couple of days. Our enchanter was
keeping 3 mobs mezzed because of a room-pull in LCY. Suddenly a monk walks
past and drags 3 other mobs on us. The shammies and my pet takes one and the
enchanter takes the other 2 as well. We kill the current one, switch to the
pet's one and all of a sudden the monk walks past again dragging ANOTHER 5
mobs with him.
Wonder above wonder, the enchanter get's them all locked. After killing the
current target we look at this and we had something like this:
"That's a lot"
"Think we can take a few?"
"Enchanter 20m"
"Cleric 10m"
"Shaman 20m, pet 30% health"
"Mage 30m, 2 rods on floor, one in hand, pet 20% health"
"Let's do one.."
"2 mez down "
"3 more mez down"
"TRAIN TO ZONE"

Never knew who the monk was but someone said he was trying to find the
zoneline...

For some reason dieing in a good group is never that bad.
Had a lot of fun and some decent experience (even rolled for the second
shammy spear that dropped and sold it for 600pp and a sow potion). If I get
in one of that kind of groups tonight I'll be walking out as a level 50 :-)
