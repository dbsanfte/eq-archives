	Which, coupled with the ww2ol disaster, will spell even fewer
MMOGs for the rest of us. If this trend of releasing horribly broken code
in order to get your product out a few months sooner continues, then
investors will no longer invest in MMOGs.

	That means that the only people making MMOGs for us will be
the people who have money to do so: Verant. Maybe Sierra, but this crap
over MEO has left something of a bad taste in my mouth.

	I know why they're releasing their clients too early: they've run
out of money, and their mentality is, "Ship it now or ship it never." In the
short term it makes a lot of sense to ship it and hope you can fix it in
the next couple months. In the long term it means less funding for MMOG
projects because of the scads of bad press that you've helped create. That
means we, the players, get shafted by your release of crap.

	I've heard people say that AO will be like EQ two years ago. I have
two responses to that: I wouldn't actually play EQ as it was two years ago
now; It had much less content, and was a lot uglier. Also, AO is /not/ like
EQ was on release. The EQ client worked pretty much flawlessly on 99% of all
systems that ran it. They had a lot of content in comparison to AO, and the
client was nearly feature complete.

	AO, in comparison, crashes a /lot/. No, a /whole lot/. Coupled with
the lag, AO is unplayable for almost everyone. The only reason I play it at
all is because it's beta, so I'll put up with the badness to get a chance
to poke around and offer my input to developers.

	The lag is /intolerable/. Outside it's okay, but enter any major
city (Tir, Omni 1) and the playability drops through the floor.

	There is no content. There are lots of pretty monsters to kill, and
lots of unfinished cities, but there are no quests. There's only a few
templates, and those have you going into the same places to do the same things
over and over again.

	Trade skills? Nope.

	Vehicles? Nope.

	All of these things can be fixed, and I have complete faith in
Funcom's ability to fix them, but they /cannot/ fix them by release. They
obviously haven't if it's gone gold. That means that the game they will ship,
and sell, is a lie. It /does not work/. That's wrong and they do us, the
players, a great disservice by selling us a lie.

	They need to ship a complete game, a good game, which they can do
if they ship it a few months from now. IMHO, if they aim for a Christmas
release, they can fix almost all of the current issues and still make the
Christmas rush. If they ship what they've promised AO will be a good game,
it certainly has the makings of a good game, but it just as certainly isn't
even close to there right now.
