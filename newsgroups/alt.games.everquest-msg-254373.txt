Yes it *was* a very broad statement, and you narrowed it down so that you could
pick it apart.  Which is fine, because you are on a rant.  Don't let me stop
ya.

But he *didn't* have decent weaponskill.  He couldn't hit as well as not being
able to hold agro and being a mana drain.  Remember?  You snipped that part. 
Apples and oranges.
I picture a selfish, clueless warrior says "fuck these people, they are
strangers, I'll never play with them again,  and I'm working on my 2 HB that I
suck at RIGHT NOW.  I can't hit the broad side of a barn with this sword but I
need to skill up.   I don't care if we lose this LDON.  SCREW THEM I'm in the
group now!".  
Gak, now you've got me ranting on the *other* end of extremes so I'll stop.
