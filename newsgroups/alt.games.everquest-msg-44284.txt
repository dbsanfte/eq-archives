Oh, you poor thing, Verant hasn't informed you of every little detail of every
little fix they make to the game and that is going to ruin your whole life.

But, just for your petty little bitterness at being treated so poorly by those
horrible programmers at Verant, I dug through the even more recent patch
messages to find this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Harla Dar has been repaired (this happened sometime earlier than today, but we
wanted you to know).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Awe ooo happy now?
