Hm, maybe my problem is worse, then.  A couple people have mentioned
fixing this that wiggling the gamma slider in-game.  But when I do so,
if I'm in the dark state, nothing happens.  And indeed, judging from
the effect when I change the gamma on my second box, the darkness on
my main box looks a whole lot like EQ is treating my gamma slider as
if it were stuck at 0%.

I can work around the problem by adjusting the gamma setting to 200%
on my display (i.e., outside of EQ), but it doesn't come out looking
quite right.
