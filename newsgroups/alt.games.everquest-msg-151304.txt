As a phone technician *absolutely* nothing disturbs me more than reading a
suggestion that potentially results in idiots finding out where the
registery is or downloading yet another useless application when the
alternative involves a dead simple non-destructive, reversible mechanical
adjustment to a AU$20 peice of equipment.

Now consider how hard it is to break the keyboard by removing a key...
*reflective pause* ...now consider what damage a person capable of breaking
a keyboard by removing a key would do if they found their way to the
registery?

*shivers*
