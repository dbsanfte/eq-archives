That's part of the problem though Ben.  

It's not "wrong."  There is no defining authority for it to be called 
"wrong."  Insisting on telling people they are "wrong" and that you have 
"fixed" what they did "wrong" even after they tell you to bugger off 
because they prefer top posts is just being deliberately confrontational 
and will unltimately only annoy.

I'm not talking about simply re-ordering a top post you follow up to fopr 
the sake of clarity.  Not at all, I do that too.

I'm talking about doing that, and leading it off with "Top Post FIXED."  

Someone does that and I can only thing, "Okay... wtf, you want a cookie?"

A less abrasive method might work better eh?
