That is not quite correct.
The lowest horse should be faster than your normal sub-50 level non-sow run.
However, Run 3 is faster than the lowest horse, 30% vs. 25%.

Yes. Sow does not stack with horse run.
The SoW is on you not the horse and you can't cast
on the horse.

Best use for the horse is for spell casters. You meditate at the
sitting meditate rate just standing still. This allows you to regen mana
at the sit rate without generation the sit-agro from mobs. Which is
a HUGE advantage IMO.
