I can't speak for others, but I have two accounts because I wanted to have
more than 8 characters on the server. My friends play on Xev, and I enjoy
playing around with all the different classes and races. 8 slots was not
enough to let me do that without deleting characters. I am now playing 14
characters, most of them currently between 30 and 35. I have a second
computer, but I don't dualbox.

For what it's worth, of the friends I normally hang out with, one has 2
accounts (hers and her late husband's) and dualboxes when she feels like
it, one has 1 account, and one couple is sharing an account until they get
a second computer.
