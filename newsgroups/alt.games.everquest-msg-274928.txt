Well, a month or so ago I met a nice lvl 40 person. Had plenty of time
to show me a few things. I added them to my friends list and
subsequently noticed every time I logged on they were already logged on
and when I logged off they were still logged on. Probably explains why
they were that lvl when I had barely hit 20.
