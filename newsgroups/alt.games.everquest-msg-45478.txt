hi

im in Burning Woods,i am a lvl47 dark elf necro

i was walking along the zone edge when an NPC called Telin Darkforest
(lvl55) attacked my pet. I successfully FD'd.
Telin took ages to move away but when he did i did the /q trick (bit lame
but , ya know)
I logged straight back in and got whacked by him again (punches for 180)

somehow i managed to get an FD off again and did the /q trick again

now, am i screwed. or perhaps does he wonder around? i am lying at p3200
p2920. (lol, like i need the p's)
if he doesnt wander, is there a way to get him to move away with a mule
perhaps?

any suggestions greatly appreciated.
