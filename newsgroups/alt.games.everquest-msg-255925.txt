I guess I just question the motives of someone who offers you something
*outrageous* for *nothing*.  
And, maybe, in all honesty, something "that" valuable *in my mind* requires
more than just *gratitude*, and *I* would feel indebted to the other person. 
So it wouldn't be free *to me*.

I used to love to date girls like that in college.

Thanks for helping me make my point.... :)))
