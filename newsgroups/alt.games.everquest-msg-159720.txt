Wrong, you can still only be melee'd by 3 mobs, the 4th and more will wander
away while you're being melee'd by 3 things.

You don't have to keep them separate, for some reason your AE will only hit
a particular 4 each time (until one dies obviously).  I don't know why, I
just attribute it to another automagical bit of spaghetti code.

That said, yes, I did octa kite once, to test Fist of Karana out on wyverns
in CS... and to piss off a fucktard 2-boxing 54 war/dru who kept claiming
