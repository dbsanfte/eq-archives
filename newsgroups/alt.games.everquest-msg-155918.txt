It may be just me, but whenever I see "for a corpse run" I immedately think
"I'm not actually dead or anything, but figure you'll port me for free out of
pity"

If they are also looking, even idly, for a rez, I'm much more credulous... but
many times I've sent someone a tell saying "I can rez you there, you
won't need a port (or sow, which is the other "for a CR" request) that way"
I've been turned down.

Its possible I'm being turned down because the victim has recieved some
fabulous buffage while dead and doesn't want to lose them, of course.  But
my bet is in most cases those particular people just don't happen to actually
be dead at all.
