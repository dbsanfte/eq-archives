Has anyone noticed that EQ2 plays out more like DAoC than any other game?
I'm not complaining, I loved DAoC when it came out and played it for about
a year (until the only thing really left was PvP and I admittedly *suck* at
PvP) and even while I was playing I was wishing that EQ would incorporate
some of the things I liked best about DAoC.

First, I like that the guards are actually "aware". More so than in EQ1,
the guards patrol and know where certain NPCs are located. It makes them
seem a little less like bots and more like they're part of your world. I
like that they've gone farther with the townsfolk and made them more
"aware".

Second, I like the fact that gear is level based. Some will absolutely
*hate* this but I like it. I know further down the line there will be some
competition for the best gear template, but with the way SOE likes to drop
loot at least I know if I can't get the uber gear I'll not be hurting for
options. 

I know there's more similarities between the two than I'm listing but for
me those are the two that motivated me go with EQ2 over the other MMORPG's
out. My only apprehension is that Raph is in charge now and the man could
fuck up a wet dream. If not for the stupendiously boneheaded decisions he
(and certain other staffers) made I'd still be playing SW:G.

By the time (the Leaning Tower of Pisa) was 10% built, everyone knew it
would be a total disaster. But the investment was so big they felt
compelled to go on. Since its completion, it cost a fortune to maintain and
is still in danger of collapsing. There are no plans to replace it, since
it was never needed in the first place. I expect every installation has its
own pet software which is analogous to the above.
