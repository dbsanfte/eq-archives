Umm, You what BRANDON is saying is that RAIDERS are a problem!!??? How in
the hell do you expect to kill veeshan with one group!!?? You need a raid
and many groups!

Heres my take on it
CAMPERS - Fine and ESPECIALLY if it is a lore item, quest related items MUST
be camped at times too.
    so, here I am needing a wolly mammoth rib for my quest armor - SHOULDNT
I camp the mammoths until I get the rib!!???
    after all - this is EVER-QUEST

FARMERS - Hunt green mobs to sell the items or twink another character -
KINDA SUX - that is when I would like to take the even con out myself - of
its yellow to me...

RAIDERS - Ummm, well..  for killling mobs over lvl 60's you kinda do need to
raid.

Quellious

NOTE: The camp I mentioned in my earlier post was on a lvl 15 character -
who had a right to camp Gnolls in highpass.
