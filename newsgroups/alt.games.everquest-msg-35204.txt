Actually as a cleric you should expect a ton of loot even as a guest.
Unlike my druid and its fellows who get JACK CRAP in the planes,
cleric like the SK is a super duper high reward class. From just a few
raids every cleric in my guild was covered in purple and we started
taking guest clerics and twinks just so the stuff did not rot. You
really have a pretty good chance of getting some piece of purple at
least. I'd only bring lots of peridots if you know you will be
reimbursed, sometimes the cleric is allowed to get the money from the
mobs or something. But yeah, otherwise healing etc.
