 I seem to be having eqclient crashes sinse the patches and they only seem
to happen either zoning into PoK or trying to log character that's already
in PoK. I can log any others on that's in another zone and play them. Also
another kicker, I can log on the test server and zone in PoK just fine. I've
tried this several times and works great. I've tried updated everything, all
drivers I can with no luck. I can't emagine what could cause just one zone
to do this. Any help would be appreciated.
