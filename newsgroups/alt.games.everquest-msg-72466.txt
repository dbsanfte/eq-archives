First off, can anyone tell me of some sort of light source I can use. Being
a human my sight at night is shitty. Since SoL verant have royally fucked
over ATi users, so our gamma is locked down at minimum. I was leaving FV via
boat, and a guy asked if any ATi users were on. I said I was, so he said
something about u can fix the new gamma bug by altering ur command line on
shortcut to eqgame.exe - anyone know about this? If u cant, can u by a high
power like soucrce. Lanterns and Fire Beelte eyes are ok but i need far more
power. used summoned necklaces with high light properties but they only last
a short time, is there any permanaent items which give out alot of light??

Anyway, what about aqualungs. Humans dont seem to hot on swimming and I
happen to like deep sea diving. I'm thinking an AL would be good for
visiting Kedge Keep etc. how long do they last and cost and where'd u get
one??

TIA
