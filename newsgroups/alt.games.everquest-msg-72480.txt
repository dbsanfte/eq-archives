I don't know where you got the syntax for that command, but it's waaaay off.

/wincolor chat R G B Tran(0-3 or 4?)
/wincolor chat 0 0 0 0 is full black
/wincolor chat 255 255 255 3 is fully transparent (might as well hit your '
button though)
/wincolor chat 0 0 0 2 is translucent gray ...and my preference.
