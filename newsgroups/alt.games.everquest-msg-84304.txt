    I don't think Verant still understands how cheesy guilds will be to make
things go faster. Verant puts "safe spots" in zones, to allow folks to pull
to areas safely, and people camp out level 55 CotH mules there for when they
raid that zone. Or in new content, they have monks with res sticks (now
there's an item that should be removed from the game) feign-flop their way
forward, dragging a mage corpse, until they find a safe area to res the mage
in for CotH. VI seems to have a blind spot when it comes to folks using
death as an advantage, or having level 55 characters as "mules".

    Pre-Kunark, the world was much, much too small for the population of
players. Content HAD to be added.

    Kunark started the most serious problems in the game: how to balance a
world originally designed for 50 levels with characters that could have up
to 10 more levels. SoL has done the same thing with alt. XP skills.

    SoV started a horrible, horrible trend at VI: they actually let the
players tell them what the reward should be like for a given level of risk.
"Buff up NToV drops plz. Upgrade epics thx. More 15 damage piercers, woot."
That just accelerates mudflation, because players always want to be buffed
UP to what they see as an "appropriate level", not nerfed down.

    Read the Jan. 29th post on the front page of
http://www.legacyofsteel.net/ and tell me that's not how the upper echelon
of players, the ones who talk the most to VI about how to change the game,
want it.
