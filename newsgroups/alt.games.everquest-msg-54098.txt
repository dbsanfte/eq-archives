No.

If they're paying you, you are *not* "doing them a favour".  You are
working for hire.  Doing it for free is doing them a favour.  Doing it
for payment is employment.

If they pay you, you *owe* them the 'port.  To do any less is to be a
scammer and a thief.  Similarly, if you 'port them, they *owe* you the
payment.
