Id leave mez mastery for a long long time.

Good aa's...
MGB
Eldritch rune
Combat stability/Lightning reflexes, and anything else that helps you take a 
beating.
Buf lengthening.
Total domination
casting subtlety
spell casting mastery

Overrated aa's...
Dire charm
Mez mastery

If your in a raiding guild then you should put mgb first.
Eldritch rune is probably the next best aa. Its saved me so many times.
