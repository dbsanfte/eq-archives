You might want to recheck the facts here.  Shaman have two lines of slows, 
the really good, magic based slows, and the relatively crappy disease based 
slows.  The best disease based slow is 40% (Cloud of Grummus), the best 
shaman magic based slow is 75% (Turgurs Insects).  The disease based slows 
I only use in a few rare instances where I know that the magic based one is 
just not going to stick, but that I can stick the disease based one.  For 
99% of the encounters, the magic based line is what I use.
