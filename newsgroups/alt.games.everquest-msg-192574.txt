On CNN tonight it was like EQ on TV.  CNN reporter Brent Sadler was running
around with a live videophone camera which gave a very slow framerate that
looked a lot like a bind sight display.  The match was good, since the
camera would bounce in the car so half the frames pointed at nothing of
interest, just like my bind sight experience.

After going through some abandoned equipment and camps, some passer-by
suggested he could go into Tikrit even though the Coalition raid forces
hadn't entered yet.  He left most of his party at the outskirts, and heads
into town with his car and a bodyguard car.  Things are pretty quiet there,
but everybody cons scowling, so he decides to back out.  On the way out he
agros a guard and charges back to his party yelling "train to zone".
Everybody makes it out just fine except the pet is down a few hps, er --
bodyguard car has some bullet holes.

Somehow the whole scene had a really familiar feel.  The later replays of
the coverage don't capture the in-game feel of the live action.
