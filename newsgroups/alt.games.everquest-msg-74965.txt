At the lower levels, you will see this a lot.  Jazz's suggestion is a good 
one - get in there and melee at the end and ninja if ya have to to get your 
point across.

In my groups, it's real simple.  Someone new joins, and I do a /gsay:

"FFA loot, do NOT screw the casters, and roll on anything good."

Alpha takes too much time, causes confusion, starts bickering, and slows 
down the EXP.  If you are bored, you can go check the posts from about a 
year ago when this was all explained to me.

If someone gets out of hand, I will usually do a gsay to the point of 
"cleric_01, grab the next few loots."   "wizard_01, make sure you grab some 
loot, don't want to let you out of it! =)"  I do this even if I am not the 
group leader.

If that doesn't get the hint across the the loot-hog, I will send them a 
tell asking them to let the casters and others loot more.  If that doesn't 
work, they're gone.  This idiot/selfish mentality with loot will bleed over 
to the other parts of the game, and when my char's life is on the line in a 
tough overpull, I don't want to be relying on a selfish person to pull 
their weight.  It's not as much the loot-hogging that matters to me, but 
the overall personality of the person behind the toon.
