But you didn't say "it's immoral for them to restrict selling your
time". You said "they have no RIGHT..."

Not at all. You're on someone else's property partaking an activity
they told you you have no permission to do on their property and
refuse to leave, you're trespassing. You're being welcome on their
property is subject to the rules they set forth. You violate those
rules, you're no longer welcome. You refuse to leave when you're not
welcome, you're trespassing.

An item "changes hands". You're selling the item.
