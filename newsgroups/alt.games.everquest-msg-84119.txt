Heard this story yesterday and it cracked me up.

The Father in the Story is actually in the same guild as me, well liked and
respected there.
I was told this story by a RL friend who I visited last night (also in my
guild and was playing with the alt of said Father while we were chatting)

Son, has a 60th character in one of the top Guilds on bristlebane, Father is
high 50's but our guild is VERY small and more of a chat group (for various
reasons but mainly due to time differences in our play)
Son gets Father a new BP from one of the many raids I am sure his guild
does. Very good, Son helps Dad out..well not exactly, Father still had to
pay for BP (at this point I think the item must of been worth a few K) How
much did it cost him? I ask....US$200!
Now whether he payed cash for this item or maybe took it off money owed to
him by the Son I have no idea but there's a novel way of earning allowance.

"Dad, I'll clean the car and do the lawn"
Becomes
"Dad, I'll get you some uber greaves"

Well, made me laugh anyway :�)
