Actually I belive it's supposed to be double the amount you're expected to
collect., but more or less, this is true.

On E'ci, it seems to be "anything but rescue" more than that.

Perhaps it's the class I play now, but I've haven't really had a (high item
number) collection that I would consider very hard.  Not counting the pickup
groups full of idiots, that would have failed any mission, of course.

As long as you go high enough, the extra risk isn't all that great, and you
*do* get an extra reward.

First, you don't have to sit at the recruiter for a half hour plus in order
to get a collection mission.

Secondly, you get more experience and more loot from doing a collection
mission.   In a slaughter... between putting the group together and waiting
for the slaughter mission to be offered, you've usually spent a good 45
minutes at the camp getting ready.   Then you get into the dungeon, and you
win it in 45 minutes, after killing 50 things.  On a collect, usually we
don't win it until at least an hour has been spent, and many more things end
up dying.   And if you so wish, you can easily work the clock to squeeze out
the extra half hour, by not looting the last drop.

That extra killing time is the bonus.  For the same cost (less really, since
collection missions are more frequently offered) in setup time, you get
nearly double the killing time.  Last night we did a mission and cleared the
entire dungeon except for three mobs.  (And we were pulling one of the three
as we got booted)   The experience is too subjective to compare, but I'm
willing to bet our group gained a lot more than the same group would have
gained doing a slaughter.   As far as other rewards, in the course of
clearing the dungeon we racked up 2 named, 3 augments and a loot split that
worked out to 520 pp each, for a 6 person group.
