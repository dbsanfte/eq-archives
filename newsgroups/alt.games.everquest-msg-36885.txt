I beg to differ. I've never used DoTs on an opponent in a duel (breaks mez,
and takes forever to do any damage), or feared, or charmed. Here are the
major weapons: tash, mez, dispel, nukes, stuns, and possibly str debuff. My
enchanter is 49, and I play on Rallos and fight people quite often. Oh, and
wizards are especially easy to kill. ;)
