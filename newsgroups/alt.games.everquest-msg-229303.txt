Well, it looks like all of yesterday's problems are back. Mobs started
disappearing again at low health, To you regulars around here, is it
always like this? I started playing shortly before the LDoN expansion,
and thoroughly enjoyed the game. LDoN was released and suddenly I was
never able to zone without the game freezing, going LD etc. I stopped
playing and waited until 2 further patches had taken place and attempted
it again. All was well again until last week's patch/patches. I can
still zone, but there are all sorts of in game weirdness. Mobs disappear
when their health bar goes under 10%. Doing a /w all friends returns the
answer 20 lines later. Spells are interrupted 3-4 times in a row when my
char is not moving etc. The latter occurred tonight while training
skills. Was just clicking the spell while stationary. All very
frustrating especially when learning the endless intricacies of a
complex game is factored in.
