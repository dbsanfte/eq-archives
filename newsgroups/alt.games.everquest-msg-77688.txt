Lance, many thanks for an interesting and informative post. Someone else
mentioned Beastlord as well. I did create one, but that was when Luclin had
first come out and I only had 128mb. It was *terrible*. (I killed her off
after about 30 minutes) I now have 256 and tomorrow will have 512, as I'm
adding some more so I can at least turn the textures on something besides
low. In another post, there was a suggestion that I create characters on
another server and try them. The problem with that is that I *know* I don't
want to even -try- to solo a warrior. And I had heard some of the same
things you've said about clerics and their soloing capability. Cleric is
only 5, so it won't be such a big deal, although she IS twinked, just not as
much as my lvl 15 warrior. I had also thought of a necro. I had one of those
for about 30 minutes, too, and killed her off because, even with a map, I
couldn't get into or out of Neriak! I stayed lost and that's pretty unusual
for me. I've since learned a lot of the territory from helping/watching a
friend who plays a necro, so I may think about that as well. I already have
a bard, a druid (she's my main), a mage, an enchanter and a shaman, all of
whom I solo fairly effectively.

Ok, I'll kill them both off then and use the money they have to twink
(slightly) a Beastlord.

thanks!
Darklet
