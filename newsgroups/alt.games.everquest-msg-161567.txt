I was in a raid at the time, probably bored in some downtime, when I quickly
made my list.

Im sure I could alter it somewhat, but it gives a general idea :p

Btw why were so many people putting SK epic as not 1 or 2 of the toughest
epics?

Imo they had THE hardest "final battle" not to mention needing a rare sword
from the PoA princess, a rare sword from PoF demis, and countless other
stuffs.

And the problem with epics that are weapons, as soon as your guild
progresses, weapon is the first slot you will upgrade to really boost your
chars value to raids

Imo thats why Warrior, SK, Pali epics suck.  Rogue epic was always
overpowered, monks was unique (tho PoP has totally freaking destroyed monk
epic), and rangers had 1 "always useful" epic, the slow sword (earthcaller?)

So what do you think are worthwhile and worthless epics?

Imo worthless epics....
Chanter : very tough, and by the time you get it NO melees will want SoS.
Even the group version of SoS is useless (even more so with the new PoP
hastes) when we finally had it drop a week or so ago from cursed, not a
single chanter wanted it
Paladin : If your a raider in a raiding guild, you will, at some point, bank
this weapon.  Im sure you feel proud of completing your epic, but when its
sitting in your bank....
Warrior : There are SO many weapons that are > epic.  You dont even need to
be "uber" to get some either.  Willsapper drops from a mob thats probably
easier than the Queen in chardok. A Swiftblade from statue and your all set
(hes half the mob that Vindi is with 10x the loot)
SK - see paladin
Ranger - the other blade (not the slow one)
Necro - risk v reward just isnt there for this epic
