There seem to be quite a few players of all classes that do not have
a clue what it means to root-park.  Well, all except Enchanters and
Rangers maybe, they die a lot and quit in frustration if they don't
figure it out.  But Warriors, Paladins (who have no excuse, since they
should be prepared to do the parking), and Shadowknights often just
stand there and take the extra pounding.  And then the dumb-asses will
(1) get defensive when you point out that the reason you told them to
back off six times was that the add was rooted ("so what, we lived, it
doesn't matter") and then (2) start whining about all the down time
waiting for the healer(s) to med.

Heh, if I have to ask the Enchanter for Clarity it's usually a bad sign.
If the Enchanter doesn't reply immediately with "coming up", "getting to
it", or something similar I start thinking of an excuse to leave the
group.  If I've got some kind of Clarity I'm a backup healer, if not
I'm only rarely gonna have mana to heal with (in normal group situations
melees don't seem to get to sit much at all).  And as for all you
"Paladins don't need mana to fight" wise-asses out there, an oom Paladin
is just a crippled Warrior without any compensating special abilities,
I'm a helluva lot more useful to a group with mana than I am without.
Whoever it was who posted that bad Paladin play was "not using mana
effectively" hit the nail on the head.
