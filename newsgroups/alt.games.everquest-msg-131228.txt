This is precisely why it's worth saying 'no' and seeing how they respond 
instead of just /gnoring them from the get-go. :)

Anyway, I'l agree that a /tell does put them on the spot to respond.  It's 
amazing how it does that, when the only real differenceis the color of 
text.  But I disagree wholeheartedly with the assertion that it somehow 
makes them say 'yes', as opposed to 'no'.  If it somehow 'forces' them to 
do what is asked, does that really make the /tell-er rude, or does it make 
the /tell-ee spineless?
