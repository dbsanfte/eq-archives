Hmm yes it is extremely hard for a untwinked tank to solo past the lower
levels,however even a rogue can solo with the right equipment.I constantly solo
uthork warriors and rhinos in EW.I am currently using top AC gear with a fungi
tunic and ALWAYS sow from potion or whatever.If ya start losing you ruhn it
around with sow until fungi heals you enough to go back at it.I am currently
44th  and plan on soloing to 50 minimum
