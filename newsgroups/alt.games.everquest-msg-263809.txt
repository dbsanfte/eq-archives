Well, my criticism is based solely on the various descriptions that have 
been posted.  To me personally, it sounds stupid and tedious after the 
first few times.  Since I have no intention of trying out EQ2 anytime in 
the forseable future, I will likely never know the whole truth.  So far, 
I have read nothing in any of the descriptions of EQ2 in general that 
give me any great desire to change my mind in that regard.
