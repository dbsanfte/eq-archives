NO GET TO MOLARS NOW(er warrens.. ahah molars on the mind).

Its a gold mine on the FV server as a newb, but constant trains there
(first time I've ever seen it get much use.. iTS A BLAST = D )
The molars drop off ANY kobolds.. and you will get them off small ones
at 5 while other people won't (they are not magic OR Lore but still
don't drop on FV if trvial (only magic or lore is not supposed to drop
on FV if trivial) So they have not changed the QUEST stuff to dropping
yet) . 

Many of the entrance mobs are very low so you could kill them and get
molars for ringmail. On FV ringmail has value for the first time (well
not for long, some guy was in freep making banded for 1 plat per ac
and I bought nearly a whole set at level 12  = D ) but you can even
sell the ringmail to npcs for a couple plat if you get it from a
molar. MORE importantly even the lowbie kobolds OFTEN drop bronze
which sells to an npc for 2 plat (on my not very pretty barb shamaness
with only 61 charisma = (  so better for you )

Everyone doing warrens on FV is filthy stinking rich. Its the best leg
up on a new server really ;)
