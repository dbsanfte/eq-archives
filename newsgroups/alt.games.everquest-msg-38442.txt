When I got to an appropriate level, I spent a couple of levels with my
friends in Rathe Mtns. hunting the Hill Giants. I would say that
accounts for several thousand of the plat currently in my bank account.
I've no doubt it's similar for many. The other source of plat, of
course, is merchants. Selling off things that you loot generates more
plat. We hunted many mobs that drop fine steel weapons for a long time
before we could hunt HGs. Fine Steel weapons sell for several plat each
and you can get hudreds over the course of a few good hunting sessions.
Other examples are legion. The plat is out there to be collected.
