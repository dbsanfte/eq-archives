I don't think it was the not working on Sunday that pissed him off.  I
would be willing to wager it had a lot more to do with the fact that
his account was banned without explanation, warning, or prior
notification.  Now I'm sure that you're going to say that he's just a
troll, but I think it's pretty common knowledge (i.e. posted to
castersrealm and stratics among others) that there have been a
significant number of accounts banned or suspended without notice, and
that a good number of them were re-instated with no explanation.  
Why don't you immediately flame Verant for making a mistake and
banning the incorrect accounts?  They made at least as much of an
error as using Gestapo in a post.
