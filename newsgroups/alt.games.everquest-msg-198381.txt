Hmmm, could be.  I haven't played on a "regular" server in months
now.  On FV they still go for over 1kpp.  Even so, WTF can be logic
behind giving a SHD a MoSS, an SBS, and adequate bracers while you
give a PAL a proc-less Ghoulbane (much inferior to even a Centi SS),
a Cracked Darkwood Shield (worth maybe 10pp on a regular server, if
you are a PAL or SHD smith), and a pair of Serp Bracers?  That shows
a painful degree of stupidity (it's _their_ game, there is no valid
excuse).  I was also unimpressed with most of the Enchanter gear,
my totally untwinked L12 replaced about half of his gear with the
"buffie" stuff, but most of the replaced pieces were cloth armor.
