well it would be unfair to say that  "... all Americans are lazy, obese,
sexually immoral, under educated butt heads",  most Americans, have some of
those traits but not most
for example our current president is NOT obese, sexually immoral and has MBA
from Harvard, but currently some people try to argue that he is lazy because
he is working from home. ( senate, congress and supreme court all are on a
month long vacation by the way)

previous president for example was obese ( hello McDonalds) , sexually
immoral ( cigars any one), lazy ( 8 years with little to show for except
crushing economy and crushed markets on the 7th year) , under educated butt
heads ( where is he from again....enough said)

So saying that ALL Americans are something is wrong however if u said ""...
some Americans are lazy, obese,
sexually immoral, under educated butt heads" that would be much more
accurate.
