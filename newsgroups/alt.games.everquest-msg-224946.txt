I think we're understanding the OP differently. I didn't see any
limitation that said "Advantages you can get without actually doing
any LDON runs only".

That wasn't just a statement about the transportation system. It was
about all the benefits - and you know you took it out of context.
Primarily, I find the ability to add gems to items adds an interesting
aspect. Yes I was thinking I'd get nailed for adding that to the list,
but I was trying to think of everything you get with it. Admittedly
it's a stretch, and notably at the end of my list. Note the "those
are" in my statement, indicating I was not just talking about the
transportation system.

I was not trying to say that you got any benefits without doing the
LDON missions. If I implied that, I didn't intend too.

Well, *technically* POK is the PLANE of knowledge, so you can't be
claiming not to be using the planes when you use POK. But yes I
completely get what you're saying, and agree - in that aspect this
expansion didn't add anything new to the player not directly using the
dungeons. But I'm sure that you agree that instantiated dungeons by
themselves added a whole new twist to EQ playing. Also, it's not
completely impossible that they will add some special gem drops to
some of the ueber-mobs at some point in the future (but yes that's
just speculation).

Yes, there was much more candy comming with that expansion. I love the
cartography system and hang out in Ykesha a lot these days, but have
yet to do anything with a Froglok past level 3 =).

I tend to agree with you, but I don't expect every expansion to extend
every aspect of the game. Conversely, the fact that some expansions
focus on particular aspects of the game, allows people that are not
interested to not buy them, without any significant disadvantage to
players that have them. I think it's probably better this way.

Also, wouldn't we all complain if they one-upped the transportation
system again?
