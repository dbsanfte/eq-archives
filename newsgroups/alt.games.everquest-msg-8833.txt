Forgive me the actual name of the web site, but I think the Mage Compendium
(sp?) web site has the full details on where and what post 16 levels spells
you can buy or have to research for. I looked at it one day back when I was
a level 8 mage because I wanted to know where to buy the spell for summoning
a staff. It not only told me where but what exactly the spell did and the
staff stats that come with it. An excellent site to behold for mages. They
even had a table that showed when your pets can backstab and bash and other
cool melee and DD spells they cast for you! I do remember that there is a
merchant in the Sea of Tears (not for sure on correct name). They had a map
to show you how to get there and what exact island she is on. They also
described in detail the steps to take to research spells and how to practice
research correctly.
Now that I'm above 16 I am in the same boat as you.
