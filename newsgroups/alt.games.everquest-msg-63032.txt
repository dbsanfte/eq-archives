It worked pretty fast for me, and it will indeed give
skill ups even if you're not underwater.  Just fire it off
at the bank one day, go eat supper, and come back to see
how many skill increases you've gotten.

Are you *sure* you're actually holding a Wind instrument?
Some of the Brass instruments look like they ought to be
Wind instruments, but aren't.  Right-click-and-hold the
instrument to make sure it says "Wind".
And make sure you're singing the right song, it should
give repeated song messages about "tiny bubbles".
