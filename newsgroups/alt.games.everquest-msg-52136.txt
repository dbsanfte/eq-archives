Learn by your mistakes, what's the point of risk, hey, why not have save
game option.
Verant always intended players to learn what to do and what not to. Let me
put it another way, I have never been in the level race, providing I keep my
current level I am not bothered but I, like you and everyone else, hate
having to get my corpse from another continent or 3+ zones away. You take
the corpse loss away and I really don't care to much about death. So there's
a mob there I think I/we can take, lets give it a go if goes to crap, I'll
be right back and we'll work something out or leave it alone. Now, if I have
to come back naked to collect my corpse from it's feet, I'm less than
enthusiastic about trying the mob with out proper contigency planning, I
want to know we can all get out alive if the shit hits the fan. You may see
it as unnecessary pressure, I see it as added excitement, I/We need this to
work or need to get the hell out of dodge.

If you're at a level to be going on a raid I'd hope you'd have the plat to
be able to afford it.
Again reward and risk, the game was meant to be challenging, I agree there
are problems with raids to planes and corpse retrievals but if you can't
stand the heat...

Out of range of a first level character, most people will learn the skill
before paying out plat that could buy them leather armour.

Thought the idea of being level 1 is you are just out of your academy,
you've been taught to wield you practice sword and deal with the weight of a
real one but have never fought an unknown quantity to the death. You have
learnt your spells and can control magic but what is going to happen when it
comes to doing it under real pressure?
The idea of EQ (in an RPG sense) is you start your character from the
beginning, sure, a boy scout might have better chances at foraging food and
getting his bearings but what's he gonna do with 5kgs of rusty long sword
(apart from strain his wrist and give himself tetanous)

Don't take this the wrong way but I think you'll love DAoC (if you're not
already playing it) it has removed many of the "difficulties" that EQ had
that people complained about, I have many complaints to make about EQ but
they are of limitations of it's, now, ancient engine. I hate the fact that a
warrior (my preferred class) cannot effectively solo the game (something
DAoC have apparently fixed, no ones high enough to test it yet) but this is
what Verant want, they want people to work together and form groups, raids
and guilds so I live with it and still enjoy playing. I'm sure they never
intended for the Necro to be the ultimate solo character but as they are not
a group friendly class (not they aren't good in groups, they just don't look
as an attractive prospect as the shaman, druid, cleric enchanter, etc) they
can hardly go nerfing them to be unable to solo past 40.

CF
DAoC will be implementing 16 spell gems and double melee health levels in
the next patch
