And in fact, there probably are.

Great, but you can't ignore the rest of them *and* reality in order to
repeatedly say "but we play the same" when not only was my *entire*
discussion in this thread about my play style compared to people who
undeniably do *not* play the same.  It becomes especially ludicrous when you
latch onto me saying I'd start at 30%.  Well guess what, I'd also start at
100%.  :P


> And you are doing nothing but try to evade that particular issue.

Watch for my post later where I'll compare how well warriors tank compared
to how well enchanters tank.  There may be a thousand differences between
them, but I'm trying to discuss just one of them, what race they are.  So,
"Given" they are exactly the same in abilities other than race...

You've "eliminated ALL other differences" and created a fantasy.  When you
get *so* hung up on your straw man, of course I will ignore your hammering
on that fantasy as the ridiculously contrived tripe that it is.

I propose that if you sit in the Nexus all day long you have an even less
chance of wiping *and* you will always be at FM.

Yes indeed, you should look into that remedial course in elementary logic. 
I suggest turning straight to the index and looking under "S" for straw man. 
:P

Or, let's take that "Given" a ways (seeing as you've drug it this far, a few
more miles won't hurt).

"Given": A cleric can handle any pull plus any next pull with 30% mana.
"Given": We pull at exactly the same rate (you seem to love this one, as
goofy as it is once you actually pay attention to the meat of the discussion
rather than tangents).
"Given": Our groups cast the exact same spells, sit at the exact same time,
regen at the exact same rate, and mobs act exactly the same.
"Given": My cleric starts with 30% mana, and yours starts with 80% (I'll
even keep this one in here to see if you get so completely distracted again).
"Given": I pull a 10% mana pull, as do you.
"Given": I pull another 10% mana pull.
"Given": YOUR CLERIC REFUSES TO GROUP WITH YOU IF YOU PULL AT LESS THAN 80%.

Get it yet?  I don't care what mana your group starts at in comparison to
mine.  It's an irrelevant tangent to the actual discussion that you have
confused with the discussion itself.  The concept of "playing hard" is
contrary to always being at 80% mana or better.  To say "Given" "we play as
hard as you" after saying "Given" "we wait for 80% mana" is ludicrous.
