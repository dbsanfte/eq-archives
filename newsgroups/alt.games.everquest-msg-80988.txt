The guards are Freeport Militia, who are on the shady side; they don't
KOS Dark Elf players, even necros, by default. Thus it makes sense
that they won't attack Gix, who is a shadowknight (not undead).
Gix is a real bastard unless he likes you...he'll aggro on you from
a BIG distance.

As far as I know, merchants don't attack anything that doesn't 
attack them first, ever. I have never seen a merchant that /cons
less than dubious. Perhaps there are exceptions out there.
