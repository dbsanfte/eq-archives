I went back for a umpteenth reading of the trilogy this month, and in
fact just finished Fellowship and started Two Towers this weekend.  When
Gandalf arrives in the Ent forest and meets up with Aragorn and the dorf
and the elf, he gives a brief accounting of what happened in Moria.
Apparenty, he and the Balrog fell for a long, long time down into the
chasm, then crashed into some very cold water which put out the balrog's
fire. They wrestled around, but the Balrog got scared (low on HP?) and
ran for it. This was good, as Gandalf didn't know the way out. The
balrog led him to the "endless stairs" or somesuch name, that took them
from the bottom of the pits all the way to the peak of the mountain,
where a small door/window opened on to the summit. They came out into
the sun, battled, and Gandalf eventually through the balrog down the
slopes to its death. He lay, spent, on the peak until that giant eagle
showed up again and carried him off to Lothlorien (sp?) where he rested
up a bit.

So no, he didn't actually die according to his account of the events.
