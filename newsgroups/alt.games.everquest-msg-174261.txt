Yeah, I think he knows that, but he's talking about how to transfer the
equivalent of cash without needing someone to help him.  I don't like  to
bother people with transfers unless they are already close by and not busy.
I now make all my transfers in a public tradeskill container (kiln, loom,
pottery wheel or oven)because I had a dropped bag picked up one time by
another player.  I didn't think anyone would take it because it was just
Words for my necro, but it happened and even though I ooc'd to please return
them I did not get them back.  Very annoying.
