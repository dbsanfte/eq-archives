I wasn't high end way back then, but I don't really see old world encounters
where CH would make any kind of a real difference.

For Vox and Naggy, their fear plays havoc on CH's 10 sec cast time.    And
there weren't any other high end encounters.  And with the small amount of
damage they put out (relatively speaking), druid and shaman heals were more
than adequate.  (if level 52 twink raiding exp is any guide.)   Cazic (in his
original form) and the Eye of Veeshan both death touched.  I'm not sure about
Inny, did he still do his AE knockback then?  That would really screw up CH
casting if he did.

Kunark times I'd think it would be starting to be used regularly in exp
groups, but it's not too good with many Kunark raid mobs.  Gore and Sev both
had fear to make it mostly unusable.   Would be good against VS, but most Trak
fights can't be MT'ed due to the trak touch proc.

Seems to me that Velious was when the spell really became broken.   Kunark
hadn't been too, too bad, but Velious was the first real round of massive
mudflation in items.   Increasing tank hitpoints allowed for insane mana
efficiency (to the point where nobody would really consider using any other
spell) as well as the ability to survive spikes during the 10 second wait.
Velious raid bosses also seem especially susceptible to CH and CH chains.
Greatly decreased use of fear and death touch in favor of AE damage and
massive hit points.  Actually, with the exception of Sontalak, I can't really
remember any velious bosses that we didn't use and abuse CH on.  (With various
degrees of patch healing, of course.)
