    You just said, and took great pains to point out, that it might be the
perception of some that shaman malX has ten times the aggro of magician
malX. You explained why they might think this, but the fact remains you
believe there's morons out there that actually think it's the malX and not
the slow that's causing the aggro.

    The other shamans that don't want to waste mana when someone else is
doing the job? We only have one shaman with Time's Antithesis, and having 5
or 6 shamans all trying to slow something at once does nothing but ensure
that the mob will ping-pong to someone on inc (in that many slow attempts,
somebody is bound to get a resist). So alternate who is responsible for
getting stuff slowed and who is responsible for malX (since no one shaman
likes getting pounded all night), and use messages to ensure that if people
are snoozing someone will notice and cover. As for the raid caring, you will
notice that I mentioned the debuff channel. Most players on our raids aren't
in that channel, as they don't care.

    They're bright enough to put their debuff calls in a separate channel,
something your shamans don't seem to have mastered yet. By all means,
continue thrashing - the rest of the NG seems to enjoy watching it.
