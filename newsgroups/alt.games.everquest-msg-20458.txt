Especially after druidic track got upgraded to 125, I laugh whenever
someone wants me to pull generic stuff because I can track it. I use
track to look for people, to check the level of mobs in the area,
occasionally to find a rare spawn. Pulling when I have no idea how far
away the mobs are? Riight.
Besides, I'm usually the healer anyway and need to med :)
