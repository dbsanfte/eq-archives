Finally got this to work today.  Basically went into the file, made sure it
was empty, checked properties and went into Advanced and unchecked "file is
ready for archiving" (have no idea if this was the problem, but I doubt it)
went into the game and typed /note test is this working and what do you
know?  It worked.  Go figure.  :)
