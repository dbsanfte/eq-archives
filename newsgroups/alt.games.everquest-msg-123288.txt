Hi All,

I would like to announce a guild proposal for a new guild on the Luclin 
server called The Greycat Tribe.  For full details go to 
http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/GreycatTribe
    Basically the idea is for an RPing guild that will have it's members 
be part of a nomadic tribe which moves around to new territories every so 
often.  Being nomads making money is important to us, so are languages 
and tradeskills and the idea is to help the members make the most of our 
efforts in these areas along with the usual guild type stuff like the 
occasional war and planned raids, etc.  From the name, our emphasis is on 
the Vah Shir heritage and family groupings but it is not a clannish 
organization and will accept beings of all races and all classes just so 
long as they like to roleplay.
     The full details are on the web site but nothing is set in stone 
since I don't have a lot of guild experience and am open to suggestions.  
The guild itself is going to be as democratic as practically possible 
with the guild leadership and plans being voted on by the members.  
Anyone who checks us out and thinks it could be enjoyable to join the 
tribe send me an e-mail or a tell as Angoss on Luclin.
