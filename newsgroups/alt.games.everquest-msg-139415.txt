Having played both a druid and wizard into the 50's I would say choose
the one you like the most. If you like both then play both of them up.
Enchanter is gonna be the one thing that helps both of them out the
most, especially if you have insight. Wizard would also require some
running help such as sow, j or t boots or a horse if you have the
money. Seeing that you enjoy helping others (i am quite the scrooge in
this regard unless they are polite) I would say go with the druid. You
will get begged for ports, sows, buffs constantly and quite often get
asked to plevel people. My new wizard on the other hand has only
gotten one port request so far (which i happily provided free of
charge because I was invited to a group by the guy earlier) and some
people dont even know that wizards can port. A druid will be asked
into a group more often in the sub 50 game.
