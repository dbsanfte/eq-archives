Speaking as a cleric, whose recently started doing seb (at 52), i'm often
asked to ML for the group, and keep the gems to cover reagent costs, never
once have I asked for this.

However

Seb isn't my "usual" hang out, and it's also one of the few places were you
don't need to symbol half the zone to keep your group alive, so yes, on
balance from a Seb group, I probably make a profit.  Nothing as staggering
as you might think, maybee a coupla hundred pp in an evening in the groups
i've done so far, 500pp at most.  If numbers were to get much higher, i'd
force gems upon others (chanter first ofcourse) to stop me feeling guilty.

However.   Seb perhaps takes up 20% of my non-guild groups, these rest of
these groups mostly take place in zones where I am required to use symbols
on some/most of the party, and often where i'm not asked to ML, and where
"sellables" don't drop which are given to the cleric, on these runs, I
generally make a loss of one or more stacks of 'dots (about 250pp) in a
session.

So?  do we clerics really rip you off? and are we all staggeringly weathly
in terms of pp or uber kit we've been able to buy? seriously? NO!
