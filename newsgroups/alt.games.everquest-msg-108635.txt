But it would make no difference at all to anyone that came in at the tail end of
the thread. They still would have to research back through the previous posts to
follow the thread because any snipping at all negates the argument for bottom
posting. The sole reasoning behind bottom posting theory is for continuity for
the one that comes in at the tail end. I still say most of the people that
follow the thread either read the top post or scroll past all the "crap" to read
the post then have to go all the way to the top if there was something about it
they did not follow. Either way they have to research. Top posting eliminated
that first scroll down to get to the "meat" of the post. I don't presume to
speak for most people anymore than people that argue for bottom posters do. =)
