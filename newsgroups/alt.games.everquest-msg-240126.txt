SoW

SoE
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2517&source=Live

Selo's Accelerando (bard level 5 song) *without a drum*
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=717&source=Live

Basic hand drum available all over norrath for a couple gold
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=13000

Note that SoE tops out at 65% increase, 
Selo's goes to 65*1.8 = 117% increase, with just a hand
drum.

I know that some of the top end drums combined with selo's
originally broke it because it exceeded the movement speed
cap.

Also, 2.2 modifier drums are available in the bazaar cheap
(got one for 100pp quite a while back).
