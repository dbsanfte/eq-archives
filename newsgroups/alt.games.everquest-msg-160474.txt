Before... harmony work 100% on all mobs unless the mob had a
"no-harmony-for-you" tag

Now harmony only works on mobs that are low 40's(?) not sure about what lv
but only work on mobs that con green to me when I was lv60. The harmony of
nature is an UPGRADE which cost 100mana to cast, NOT AE(single target) and
HAS a resist check.
