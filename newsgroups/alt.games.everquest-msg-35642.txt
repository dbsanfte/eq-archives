    Oddly, I always thought that of the cultural helms the ogre male one was
one of the least absurd. The Aztec look is savage and sturdy, and fits with
a culture from a tropical jungle region. Do you have Slimfast (a Guise)
available? If so, also consider how it would look as a Teir'Dal.

    Thought for the weekend: take that clown suit you're beginning to
collect. Now put it through the SoL graphics engine. Imagine what YOU will
look like, the armour, the cultural helm, and all the non-visible pieces of
armour you never worried about before....
