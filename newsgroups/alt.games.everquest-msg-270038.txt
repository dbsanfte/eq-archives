If they systematically do not get you ahead in gear or xp? What then? 
How will a player that only wants to do stuff that is worth mentioning 
ever make level 2?

That is poor game design.

Sure. But if doing something 'worth mentioning' invariably gets you no 
where, or even sets you back, something is seriously wrong.

That is poor game design.

I think you haven't answered the question yet.

But do you think doing trivial things are *ever* worthy of mention?

Even if some things at the edge of your abilities aren't worth 
mentioning, that's the only place you'll find stuff that *is*.

Which? trivial things or things at the edge of your abilities?

Right now, the *best* way to level is by doing trivial things, and 
*avoiding* doing doing anything else.

The path of least resistance to advancement is the least fun. *That* is 
poor game design.
