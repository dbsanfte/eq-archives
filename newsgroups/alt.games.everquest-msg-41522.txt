Go to Highpass and get bound there. You should have no faction problems.
Fight the orcs in the pass for a level or two until you can move into
HighKeep and get into a guard room group. Should take you to 30 easily.

At your level, big money just doesn't happen for non-twinks. Sorry. 200
plat is pretty good for a lvl 20 IMHO. Once you move into the Keep (if you
follow this advice) you'll start earning a bit more. The pickclaw guards
generally drop a few plat each.
