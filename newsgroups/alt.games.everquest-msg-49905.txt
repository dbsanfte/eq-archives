That is why I always flame the message, not the name. Too many people can
"hack" into your email and set you up.
This should change now that the U.S. government has passed its
anti-terrorism bill. One of the paragraphs in it have
labeled hacking and other forms of electronic fraud as terrorism, carrying
with it the possibility of a life sentence for
anyone caught. It is a bit extreme, and at first I was totally against it,
but with people like the one that posted in your
name, I am beginning to see things a bit differently. Check out the site
www.techtv.com they have links to the posting
that describes in detail the anti-terrorism bill. It is scary to think what
they can do with it, but it is scarier to think that
we have become a world that could spawn the need for such a bill.
