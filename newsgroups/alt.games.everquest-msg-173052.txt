On Xegony the two top tier guilds raped and pillaged VT for long time and
have moved to Tier4 in PoP and no longer go there.

There is one other guild just starting to farm there over past few weeks.

My guild is farming keys and shards like crazy as we are ready to go there.
Three other guilds farmin shards etc. but out of them only 1 could possibly
ever defeat Emp
