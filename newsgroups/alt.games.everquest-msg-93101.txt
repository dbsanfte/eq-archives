I cannot agree with you more on this.... I ALWAYS ask the group I am
grouped with if they mind if I do a rez... and after rezing I ALWAYS
split the ammount donated, even if it was only 10 plat.
Fun part about this is often people dont even notice when I do a
split... and someone in group will say 
"Hey, where did I get this 25 pp from"
Of course, I do tell them that I did the split so that they will know
what type of cleric I am.

What I hate the most as a cleric, is after getting a tell for a rez
and completing the task, the individual has the GAUL to ask... how
much?   I reply  
" to have you ask, cheapens our relationship.  Pay what you feel it
was worth."
or...
" When you ask a question such as this.. it gives the appearance that
you are a shill trying to con your way out of paying for the servcies
"you" requested.  Pay what it is "Worth" to you."
