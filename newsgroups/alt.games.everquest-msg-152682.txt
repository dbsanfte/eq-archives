8 rat terriers: 3 are mine all rescues:
Sally she was first:
Sammy the Fat Psycho food obessed (he is my boy)
Duffy, master of teaching fosters how to play again.

The Fosters are:
Angel: sweetie who was shot and thrown from a moving vehicle into traffic.

PJ: 13 year old who JUST learned how to be a pet, was locked outside most of
life, her only toys where rocks in the yard, she sometimes still likes to
bite rocks.
People just got tired of her and threw here away:

Leelee: found running down road in traffic, no one responded to lost and
found poster: she has a full tail:

Gracie: the littlest with the desire to own her own person:

Bubbie: Not crazy about strangers or kids, was very abused by childred: once
he gets over his fear becomes a boneless dog as he sleeps on your lap.

We also have 5 Cats all rescues:
Tessie: primadonna of world:
Tiggy: the magic kitty
Trakkie: the kitty found at amtrack station:
Abbie: the outdoor kitty who only comes in when temp drops below 70*
and Lump: who is a lump of cat, no personality not moving except to eat or
use litter box: Hel we did not know she moved for the first 5 days we owned
her, we only knew her food bowl was empty and he box was used, she was in
same positon as when we left her.

Love your family and LOVE your animals.
SPAY AND NEUTER!!!
