I checked my print of the eqtraders list, you can buy "Bread" at all of the
inns in EC, according to the list. Give it a try. Other sources are:

Freeport:

bread, mixing bowl, 4 cookbooks, Delivered Note - Rashinda Elore (Office of
Landholders, N. Freeport), Ran Brownloe & Pincia Brownloe (unlabled building
next to monk's guild, W. Freeport)

bread - Innkeep Palolo (unlabeled inn near bank, N. Freeport), Innkeep
Evelona, Innkeep Rille (Jade Tigers Den, N. Freeport), Gern Tassel (Tassels
Tavern, N. Freeport); Innkeep Nasumi, Innkeep Hunter (Freeport Inn, E.
