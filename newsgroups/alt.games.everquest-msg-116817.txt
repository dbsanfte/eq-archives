Well one time i was in highhold and a gm told a guy i knew camping
some goblins something about some guys who petitioned about some one
camping at some goblins getting exp,  which leads me to believe gms
frown on players tossing other players salads.

You don't have to second guess gm policies from stories like above. 
Want to know what gm's frown on, read the policies.  Don't post stuff
like this, it is heresay and a waste of time.

GMs frown on whiners bugging them.  Petitioning to whine about someone
taking all the spawn will just be ignored, or if it is answer the gm
may tell someone to share the spawn with you, which they are doing
anyway.  All you would accomplish is just to waste everyone's time. 
At least the guy your petitioning about is getting something
accomplished.
