The thing is, the judgement call comes on how recognizable and how
likely the name is a "bad" reference. That's where the GM's job comes
in. My opinion on the name doesn't mean jack if the GM decides its
okay. The books you pointed out and the city name aren't easily
recognizable. However, just about every young American out there will
recognize "Chronic" as a likely drug reference. The average American
doesn't use the word any other way except maybe in school or talking
to a doctor. There is a much larger likelihood that "chronic" on the
name of a character in a computer game refers to pot than any other
meaning of the word.

Given the average populace of an MMORPG, I'd wager half the population
doesn't even know the "real" meaning of "Chronic". Those that do are
also smart enough to know the obvious drug reference that it can be
taken for and chose another name to avoid problems. Just like "Juggs"
could have many legitimate meanings, but on a female character, it can
just as easily be taken as a reference to boobs and get nerfed, so any
halfway intelligent player won't name their character that.

In the end, it's the GM's call. My petitioning the name isn't what
gets a name nerfed, the GM's judgement on it is. Even guides can't
make the call on whether or not a name is bad, they're *supposed to*
pass every name petition on to the GMs. ("Supposed to" because I ran
into at least 2 occasions on Tunare where the guide has tried to
literally argue me out of filing a complaint against a varient of
"Drizzt" and one that was "Raistlin")
