Ahh.  Another self-righteous twit who thinks he's qualified to tell the
rest of us what the developer's intent is.  Were you by any chance a hall
monitor in grade school?  Or maybe the kid who sat at the front of the
room and reported to the teacher when she got back from the john?  Are you
following a law enforcement career path?  The image of Barney Fife sitting
at a computer, /petition'ing every 5 minutes comes to mind ...

Now that you mention it, a separate server IS a great idea.  You and
TwoHead can move there and take turns being the player and the GM.  Be
sure to watch each other very, very closely.
