Nor should someone have to pay out the kiester because someone sued him
without reason.  If the looser pays, at least you have the choice of
deciding whether or not it's worth it to sue.  The way things are now, you
can't decide whether or not you're going to be sued.

We already have laws against frivelous lawsuits, yet we don't see much
happening with them.  Judges seem to be takeing the prudence out of
jurisprudence these days.

The more I think about it, the more my idea for federalizing all lawyers
makes sense.
