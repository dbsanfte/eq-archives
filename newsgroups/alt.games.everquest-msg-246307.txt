Had great fun reading of your antics,  you made it sound like so much fun,
my husband and I ran out and bought the game.  It is so beautifully done.
and it is sure is nice not seeing any carbon copy's running around.


I too choose Protector server so if you ever see Violette running around
that would be me.  She's only lvl 4 so far but I don't want to abandon my eq
friends .

But I will say this I can't wait til CoH's expansion CoV.  (insert evil
laugh here)
