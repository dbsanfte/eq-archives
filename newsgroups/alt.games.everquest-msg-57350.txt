165 WIS at 25 is GREAT!  I'm 25 and my WIS is 151.  I think it'll probably
stay that way for a while.  In a couple of levels I'll go for the aviak
charm quest thing for +4 WIS but other than that I think I'll just
wait until I start porting and buy some of the more expensive WIS items.

Is your druid your primary?  If not, how could you afford all of that gear?
I have 6pp in the bank now. hehe

With 151 I have enough mana to take low reds again, if nothing much goes
wrong.  I prefer yellows though as that lets me have a little more than a
bubble left over as a JIC.
