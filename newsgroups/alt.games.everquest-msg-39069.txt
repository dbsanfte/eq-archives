Horse? Only stuff I recall about horses is that I might have mentioned
the zoophiliac I talked with on another chat one day. Care to
enlighten me via email, or is it too painful?

You should see the current ick theme of the mailing list: cat cooking.
It started with a website where someone had pictures from a cat
dissection made out as if they were recipes and cooking instructions,
then we started mentioning worse things and so far I've topped them
all with the Chinese cat segments of a documentary on animal abuse I
once saw (suffice to say it made me want to wage war on China).
