I'll take your word on this. If their test environment was anything
like the one I was stuck with years ago, they need to make sure their
test server and client systems more closely resemble the live ones.
Main problem probably being the live servers are big honkin' expensive
systems while the internal test servers are probably some el-cheapo
Fry's barebones system with just enough added to support up to maybe
six clients. The test clients are probably mid-range Dell's or Compaqs
that run the game with minimal effects. Actually, I know they're
low-end systems because when I had them confirm my wifes character was
indeed bugged after the haloween patch, it took them almost an hour to
even bring up the character select screen. I insisted on being on the
phone with them while this happened. I heard the music in the
background. I'm suprised they were even given speakers.
