Plus most of non-caster skills can be practiced with
no risk (and often no mob), like Instill Doubt, Beg,
Sense/Disarm Traps, Sense Heading, Sneak, Hide, Feign
Death, Bard instrument/singing skills, Swimming, a bunch 
of Monk battle skills (I think), etc. etc.

So I'm not sure why Verant would have a "do it and you'll
get suspended" level of concern about earning a few melee
skill points in a similar fashion, for a change.
