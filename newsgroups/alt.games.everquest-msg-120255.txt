I know someone who once had a cat that let the dog abuse it.  Their dog
would gab hold of it's leg, and drag it around in the yard, through the mud,
water, gravel, anything, with the cat screaming the whole time.  The dog
would sometimes back up to it and kick it out of the way.  The dog would
also at times bite it's tail, take it's food, and do anything it felt like
to this cat.  The cat had fair chance to get away (the dog couldn't run very
well), and during the attacks, the dog wouldn't have constant hold on it.
The cat would run from the chickens (who too would occasionally pick on it
as well...getting a small group together to chase it around a bit, sometimes
pecking at it when they got close).  The cat was so stupid it would take the
abuse from the dog, ignoring the chance to run, but would try to flee a
small group of hens and on occasion the rooster.
    However to prove it's lack of fear, their other dog, a much bigger one,
was nice to the cat.  He would allow the cat to sleep on top of him while he
was laying down, and sometimes even while awake wouldn't get up if the cat
were still laying on or against him. (Though we often questioned weather
this dog was doing this more out of laziness, based on the way he normally
acted.)
    Eventually the cat did run off though...but this wasn't confirmed if he
ran off, or got shot by a neighbor or eaten by something (they lived about
10-15 miles from the nearest city, and did have snakes & other wild animals
as well as free-roaming dogs out there).

    To prove the stupidity of dogs, this same guy had another 2 dogs (not at
the same time) who both were those cattle herding dogs (that breed anyway).
Rather than nipping at the cows' hind legs to try to lead them where he was
supposed to (he would on occasion, just to show he knew how, but often was
confused about this), both tried to bite the tires of vehicles.  The first
one died by sticking it's head under the back tire of the tractor (not just
near the edge, came at it from the front, and stuck it's head down on the
ground, against the tractor's side).  The next one did a similar act with a
mini-van (coming at it, and sticking it's head under the tire, but closer to
the inner part).  Both dogs came from the same people though (where this guy
got them from).  The theory was that to keep the pure blood, they might have
been in-breeding for multiple generations (because these people didn't seem
to ever buy any other dogs, just producing their own).
