I'm currently based out of Rivervale with my wife's druid, having made
the trek from Faydwer. We're planning on roughing up the goblins of
Runnyeye some before moving on.

In the meantime, I'm spending my time doing quests, killing the few
blue-to-me critters in Misty Thicket (gotta give Mooto a try soon) and
so on.

And, while Rivervale is heavy with druids, of course, there's been some
call for me to do binds for travellers.

I don't ask for money, as I find that people are more willing to do it
voluntarily. Some fairly high level characters (I'm assuming they're
either hunting the Kithicor or visiting the Thicket for a quest) have
been tossing a lot of plat at me. A human warrior gave me 4 PP and ran
off just a little while ago.

Now, to me -- 12 PP in the bank -- that's a lot of money, but he clearly
didn't think twice about it. Some newbies have been asking me when the
money starts rolling in -- I'm rolling in it in their minds -- and I had
to say I had no idea.

So, help a newbie out (me, and then the others later): When does the
money start flowing more freely, and where do you have to go to get it?
