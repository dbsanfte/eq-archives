And BOY is it nice....
It has great +INT modifiers for low levels in their teens.
I'm still wearing some stuff in my twenties, since I don't have an 
abundance of cahs to spare on other equipment.

But its a real pain to collect all the correct briar snakeskins. Some 
recipies require large ones, others regulars, and even some giant skins are 
needed. Furthermore the spider and spiderling silk is relatively easy to 
come by in Tox forest, and the occasional woven silk cord as well.

All in all, if someone decides to play an Erudite Necro, just go back to 
Tox when you hit lvl 12 or so, and go hunt for your armour by killing 
spiders and snakes. I was lvl 15 when I did this, and I almost gained an 
entire level during hunting for my ingredients :-)
