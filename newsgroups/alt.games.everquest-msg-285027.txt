Added with TSS, new spell resist counter.  It's being used to tune and 
scale the TSS raids.  It's not being retrofitted to any older gear, it's 
on a bunch of TSS augs (which have like 100hp, +15 corruption, 6% dot 
shielding, various combinations like that).  Some of the new priest 
spells provide corruption resistance or cure corruption counters.

Unless you're raiding in TSS my understanding is don't worry about it - 
but I'm not sure what they class raiding as (i.e. will some higher end 
TSS 1 or 2 group encounters require corruption resists - not sure).

I do know that rewards for the level 71 armour quests in TSS do *not* 
have corruption resists on them, either for the first or second phase.
