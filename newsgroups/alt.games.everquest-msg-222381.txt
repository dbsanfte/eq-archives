MT looks like they're about to get owned by train? Always FD and wait for
the agro to clear - your heal is not going to save them with 6 mobs
rampaging around. Ok your FD your group is getting owned, they all die and
back to their spawn points. Your still alive, at camp and able to claim the
camp - you all wipe in PC and your camp is going to get taken.

At later levels this tactic is a boon for recovering after wipe - for
example: - your group is deep inside Chardok B, tank goes down, agro jumps
wildely about the group, cleric goes down, group wipes - now you've got
yourself one hell of a nightmarish corpse run - a fight down to Chardok and
then through Chardok B naked! On the other hand at the first sigh of an
impending wipe the necro FD's, wait for mobs to go away - /quit out of the
game to clear agro. Necro re-logs, rezzes cleric, cleric rezzes everyone
else - your back fighting in 10 mins. In a wipe necro's / SKs / monks will
often use the FD /quit tactic to avoid certain death and clear agro.

Don't listen to the mage, he's just jealous he can't FD.
