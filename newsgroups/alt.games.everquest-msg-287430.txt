Back in the Atari days (800 and Mega-ST2 here) the games were nowhere
near as complex.  We didn;t expect much from Dungeon Master because it
was already better than Beserk and Asteroids.  There were still bugs
though, they just never got fixed.

These days, when you want to allow 300k+ players from anywhere on the
planet to interact in real time with everything and everyone else,
that's a serious challenge.  I don't begrudge the bugs, I begrudge the
vision.

And if you are amazed that people have put up with bugs from MMO's I
can only assume you've never had a Microsoft OS.....
