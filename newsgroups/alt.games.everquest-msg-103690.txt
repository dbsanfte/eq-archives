At L24 batskulls are worth 24 mana each, that's the comparison to make.
If you have access to 35 mana earrings (gold / black sapphire?) they
will give more mana than the batskulls until you reach L35.  The 25hp
from those earrings (if i'm thinking of the same as you) is a nice
added bonus.

Use the best stuff you can lay your hands on.  You are already at a
level where INT boosts give good mana, once your INT is 200 you want
to work mostly on getting mana boosters.  You may have to exercise
those toes a few times to get things up at or near the best that's
available for your budget, but it sounds like you're doing just fine.
