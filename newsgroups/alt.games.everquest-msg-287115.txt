Is it just me, or does it seem like the OOC regen duration (3-minutes
to full HP/mana) is actually *forced* on players for better or worse?
I mean, my level 4 Iksar necro alt (low INT, so smallish mana pool in
the first place) should have been able to med to full in less than
three minutes, but it seemed like the OOC rate was locked in. I didn't
get around to actually running any tests, but has anyone else noticed
this or actually tested it at low levels?

Also, I don't recall clarity potions overriding the necro hp->mana
conversion line of spells before. Has this always been the case?

Lastly, is OOC regen as good as it gets, or is it possible to increase
even that regen rate (clarity potions, conversion spells, etc)?
