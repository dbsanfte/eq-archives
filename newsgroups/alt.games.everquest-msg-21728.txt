I have two or three 10slot sewing kits filled with assorted sabertooth
hides from my time in Overthere, waiting for me to 1. get above 80 and
2. get more morning dew and oak bark. I have a feeling I might just go
with crystalline silk for the imbued studded gap, considering how much
of a  pain in the butt getting enough dew and bark is. 

A guildie is doing the shawl quests, he's on the 5th now and can't go
to Velk's anymore. He is half elf druid. Poor guy.

(I've been skill 80 tailor for quite a while now - I just haven't
gotten around to getting the HQ pelts I've stashed on my alts yet.
I'm a lazy slob...)
