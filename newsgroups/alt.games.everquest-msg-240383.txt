Ben, most potion merchants sell a 'chipped bone rod' which will when 
cast aim you to face the direction of your corpse. Just start running in 
the direction of the body and you will get to it. Careful not to get too 
lost, as the rod only has 3 charges on it.

Alternately, you can get a cleric with 'sense undead' or a bard with a 
song that does the same thing, or a necro that can actually group with 
you and summon your body to you at the edge of the zone.

I personally would recommend the necro if you have the money to buy the 
coffin component, as running into the desert may get you killed again if 
you dont have your arms and armor. I haven't oplayed my necro baby 
lately so i can't remember offhand how much the component costs, but it 
is castable by a necro under 20.

at eq.toolbox IIRC they have downloadable maps for all zones, and an 
additional little download that puts gridlines across the map. I find it 
invaluable for finding things by location.
