See I don't see the problem with every Tom, Dick and Mary being in the 
business. It allows those of us that don't get to play very often a 
viable solution to be able to sell a few items without spamming "WTS 
somethinorother" all night. Set up trader, and sleep. Morning comes, and 
viola, item was bought.

As far as it having "devastating results on the economy" I can't really 
say. I have never bought or sold anything over a 1k in pp. I can see 
where it might miff some people because there is competition over 
selling certain items now, but I tend to think it helped to level out 
the economy somewhat.
