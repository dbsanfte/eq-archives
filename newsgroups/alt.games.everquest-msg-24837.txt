Apparently so. Above is the original post, followed by your comment.

You will note that when your response doesnt split the post
the "Where were all the poor suffering lowbies?" statement is a
rhetorical question that is immediately answered by the following:

"They were in the lake of ill manners levelling up. The
simple truth is no one goes after this stuff because it is
not worth the trouble for anyone who can get the EP for doing it."

You then followed up with

>where they are... somewhere else, not being slaughtered by ten green

It would seem "in the LOIO, because no one does this stuff; its not worth 
the trouble" and "somewhere else, not being slaughtered by ten green
mobs at the same time" are stating pretty much exactly the same thing.

Anyway. Its not really relevant and I dont want this to descend
into a bizbee-bitchfest[tm] about it ;) I was just surprised as you
usually research your replies by at *least* reading the original
post ;)

I was curious as to if you'd managed to get a different interpretation
of the original statements... Im still not really sure, but I'm realising
its probably not worth the trouble to find out ;)

Sui,
