Twisting is a do.  Twisting with hotkeys is a don't.  Hotkeys may make it
easier when you start, but if you get used to that crutch then you won't be
able to do good twisting when you need it.

Twisting is the process of running bard songs in sequence.  To be short,
bard songs all take three seconds to start and last twelve seconds.  Thus,
you can start one song, and if you stop it as soon as it starts then start a
second song, then when that song takes effect stop it and start a third
song, then stop it as soon as it works and start the first song again... the
effect is to have all three songs running at the same time.

A far, far better guide to twisting can be found at www.eqdiva.com, or at
the bard message board (which I don't have the URL for but is linked from
EQDiva).

The problem with hotkeys is that you can't change which songs are twisting
until the hotkey ends.  So, for example, let's say I'm doing a basic combat
twist - slow/snare, damage shield, and haste - as songs 1, 2, and 3.  Assume
I have my mezz song on key 6 (since I do).  An add comes in and I need to
mezz it; I can instantly change my twist to 1,3,6 (slow/snare, haste, and
mezz).  Unless I had a hotkey made for that twist, I couldn't do that with a
hotkey twist - and if I did, I'd still have to wait for my current hotkey to
end before I could start the new one, which gives the add as much as 12
seconds of beating on my healer before I could mezz it.  If a second add
comes in, my twist becomes 6,3,6 (Mezz, Haste, Mezz) and again I couldn't
switch songs instantly if I had a hotkey twist set up.  Not only that, but
since I didn't have fine control of which song was starting when, I'd be
likely to be targeted on the wrong mobs for the mezz - it would get messy
fast, and likely cause a wipe instead of an easily controlled situation.

Give yourself a chocolate-chip cookie if you read that mess and actually
understood it.  :)
