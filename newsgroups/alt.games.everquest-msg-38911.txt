But what they said was so much more than mere words.  The voice and how
it is used conveys as much as the words.  You may have something with
the eye comment....

...in that what is a great task in your eyes (reading the subtitles and
still watching the movie) is hardly noticeable to another.  I am able to
read the subtitles and watch the movie without effort, so for me it
works fine.  For you, since reading takes away from watching the movie I
can imagine such a film is pure hell, especially since the good ones run
2 or 3 hours hehe.  There is no right answer to the question which is
better, its entirely subjective based on who you ask.  Heck for me it
comes down to the language involved.  Italian, Japanese, Chinese,
Spanish and many others I definitely want to hear the original and read
the translation.  French on the other hand I'd prefer to have dubbed,
doesn't work for me the same way and I even speak some French, just
something about the sound of the language that doesn't excite me <g>.
