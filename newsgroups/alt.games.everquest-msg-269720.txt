You aclimate pretty fast really.  I moved from Southern California to 
mid-Michigan a number of years ago, in January.  By the middle of the 
winter, on the first sunny day to come around, I was driving my Miata 
around with the top down.  By spring, when it finally warmed up into the 
40s F, I was in a T-shirt because it was so balmy.   I regularly went out 
to the mailbox, yearround, barefoot to get our mail.  We lived in a rural 
area with an approximately 100 ft driveway, and the mailbox was on the 
other side of the street.  In fact, I drove my Miata out from So Cal, via 
Missouri, hit Springfield the day after they got dumped on with 20+ 
inches of snow.  Was quite the experience for me.  I still drive that 
Miata yearround, here in Colorado, as I did in Michigan.
