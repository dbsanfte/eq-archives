All, I have a problem I hope you can help me address. I am unable to eat or 
drink by right clicking on an item. I can open bags and containers fine by 
this method. Is there a switch somewhere that will turn this on? It is 
gettingt o be a problem as I can't use gate potions and other similar items 
(if there is another way I don't know how to do it). Thanks.
