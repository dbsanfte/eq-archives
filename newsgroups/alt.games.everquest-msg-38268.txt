You should hunt outside the arena.  This is where I hunt right now also, and
I'm the exact same level as you.  You can solo aviak guards EASILY (I'm not in
the slightest bit twinked, and I can take the reds).  The regular aviaks are
NOT worth it.  Just run to the zone line and so you can be sure you'll never
die.  They don't hit too hard for their level.
