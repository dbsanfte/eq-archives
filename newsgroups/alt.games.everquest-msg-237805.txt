Usually, kiting and fear spells are frowned on in dungeon situations.  The
rooms are too small and the liklyhood of picking up an extra mob or two is
too great.  As a warrior, I realize how hard it is to get agro back once the
kiting starts.  Make a key and protect your self if you can.  You might pull
it over next to the tanks so they see the problem (standing behind them
makes them look all around to find you - then chase all over trying to get
agro).
