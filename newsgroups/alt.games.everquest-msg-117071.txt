Looking at what you're doing, to YOU, however, leveling DOES equal
happiness.  You hit the brick wall known as "the 50s" and you can't stand
the fact that it takes forever to level...so you create another alt.

Its a shame, really.  If you found some friends to regularly hunt with,
there's lots of cool zones in which to have fun...oh yeah, and you'll even
level eventually, though that's a minor concern.
