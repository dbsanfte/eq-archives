Heh, I think I know exactly where you're talking about.  Dunno if I needed 
lev to get in, but I definitely had it.  But I ended up having to gate to 
get out, lev or no.

I was for a while convinced that certain areas in the top of highhold were 
non-obvious enough that very few had ever been there... until I realized 
one of the mobs in there was an NPC for a quest that had been solved. :)

Still, I really liked the idea that I was finding something 'new'.
