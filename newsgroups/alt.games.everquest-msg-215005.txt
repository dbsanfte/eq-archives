I traveled and hunted different mobs across Norrath.  But my travels seldom
took me to any of the islands in ocean zones.  I am afraid of getting killed
in middle of the ocean.  Can you recover corps from the bottom of the ocean?
It was hell when my level 40 ogre shammy got attacked by wood elf on sister
island.  Although she was green to shammy, she jumped on to the boat and
started to stab me.  Since shammy was on the boat he could not cast spells
and could not hit her!  So she kept poking me until I jumped ship.

The deepest place I died once was in Lake Rathetear.  At the time my shammy
was level 27 and he was a pretty good swimmer but this rogue came up behind
me and poked me for 500 hit points!  All mobs in the ocean or lake zones are
better swimmer than any PC.  I almost ran out of the breath diving down to
get my gear from my corps!  That lake is deep!

Emilio.
