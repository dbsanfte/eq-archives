See, you're new to EQ.  Most of the assholes here (points to self) are 
not.  An outage of this short used to be pretty common, and is pretty much 
par for the course.

When you start saying hacked, we assume that you're either a clueless 
newbie (in general, not just in EQ), a troll, or a 1337 d00d.  Generally 
people who know enough to find newsgroups are also pretty much internet 
veterans, and know that can't reach != was hacked.

You've never seen problems getting to a site before?  That's is the big 
confusion.  The internet is and has always been a best-effort network.  
There are many, many reasons for a site to be unavailable rather than 
hackers.

Bah, you're one of *them*!  Go away, go away now!  We don't like people 
who play other games.  Actually, we don't really hate people who play 
other games, though there is a very strong anti-cheater sentiment here.  
To the point that asking a question that may in any way, shape, or form 
indicate that the questioner has engaged in, tolerated, or even known that 
such behavior existed gets our guard up.  The *easist* troll here is 'I 
wanna have God mode.'  The second easiest is 'Why are the servers down?'  
You were able to word the second one in such as way that we thought you 
might be leading up to the first one, so we launched pre-emptive strikes.

Everquest is probably the least hacked generally available game in 
existance.  Verant isn't perfect, but they sure understand that game 
integrity is important.

There are currently 118,419 networks being advertised to Digex at a busy 
public peering point.  Is it possible that even though you only see a 
problem with a single one of those routes, there are still other problems?
Everquest is an internet game, and when there are internet problems 
ANYWHERE between your computer and Verant's servers can cause problems.  I 
can tell when a certain provider switches their traffic in the northeast 
immediately because it affects my EQ.  It doesn't mean that there is an 
attack going on, or even an outage that they're routing around, just that 
for some reason the provider has shifted their preferred routes.   

You seem to be able to take a flaming.  Learn to just shrug and move on 
and you'll be flaming newbies here in no time.
