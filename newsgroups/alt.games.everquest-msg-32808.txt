I am a 19th dwarf cleric, currently in LOIO. I have almost 200pp
to spend, and I think I need to invest it in (a) some wis or mana
armor items, and/or (b) a better weapon. I have the screaming
mace which really isn't such hot stuff for my level, not that I
melee a lot anymore of course.

I have some magic armor/jewelry items on, nothing spectacular. I
am carrying the shiny brass shield from the Crushbone orc
trainer.

Actually if we assume I'd be selling the mace and a couple other
current items I might have like 225pp to invest right now, total.

Anyway, I'd be curious as to what items some experienced clerics
would look to buy in these circumstances, and where would be the
best places to purchase them. All advice welcome, thanks.
