I am sorry, I know your news reader of choice makes you more of a man than
someone who uses outlook express. What was I thinking.
I bow down to your greatness in being able to use what ever news reader you
want. Personally I don't want to install yet another piece of software when
I am smart enough to use the piece that is already installed.

As to the person who said OE is the only new reader that quotes entire
messages when you reply, must have made some changes to his news reader to
not quote the entire thing.

Personally I would rather nothing was quoted then people might actually have
to read the entire thread instead of just the piece you decided to quote.
