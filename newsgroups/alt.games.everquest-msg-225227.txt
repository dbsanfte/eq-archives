I hear ya. I'm the same way. Sometimes I just don't feel like dealing
with it, so I go it alone. However, when I do, I don't settle into a
situation where I'm basically doing all the things I would be doing if I
were grouped like making it a point to watch others' backs and helping
others finish off their own mobs. I also accept the fact that my xp will
suffer a bit in doing so. 

Soloing is all well and good. I don't agree with having a bonus for
grouping and not one for soloing. I don't see a need for a solo-only
server though. It just doesn't sound practical at all.
