Just as everyone would level a character of every class to 65th with 
200+ AAs given enough time...?? Sure maybe eventually... but that's a 
long way off. Most players have a main and a couple hi-alts...

Add enough tradeskills to match the number of classes, and similiar time 
investment to max one out you'll end up with the same spread... the 
average player would have one GM and a couple hi alts... (probably less 
because some players simply won't want to do the Tradeskill thing, 
regardless of how much fun it is)

Replacing the tedium of clicking with the tedium of farming?? Are you 
serious? Most of EQ is the 'tedium of farming'... from camping rare mobs 
by camping place holders, camping rare drops, to grinding AAs, to 
factioning, ... if they could elevate tradeskills to the 'tedium of 
farming' it would be a grand accomplishment.
