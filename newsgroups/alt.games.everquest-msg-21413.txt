I'm guessing high elf?  I'm guessing she wasn't doing anything but crowd
control and buffs either.

Point in fact, according to http://eq.castersrealm.com all of your stuns
last for 6 seconds, or one tick.  But during that one tick the critter may
get off 4 (possibly more) hits.

But yeah, cast Stun when you're FM and there's some reason to cast it (why
bother if the critter's going to be dead soon enough or doesn't do much
damage?).  If you don't need to stun and you're FM, melee and nuke down to
70% mana.  Being a cleric IS fun and a challenge, even if all you do is
med/heal/med/heal, but it's also fun to nuke and melee sometimes.
