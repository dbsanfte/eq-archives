Actually, we got the answer to that when they screwed up a patch a while
back and _were_ attributing the hate from a DS to the character wearing
it.  IIRC, it was corrected within 48 hours so that, once again, hate
for DS damage is unattributed.

Interestingly, there's a thread on TSW with parses that appear to show
that hate generated by melee attacks is exactly that: hate generated by
the attacks, whether you hit or how much actual damage is done did not
have any effect on the results of the tests.  It appears that the hate
from each swing is proportional to [weapon base damage + damage bonus],
with different modifiers for 1h and 2h.  Among the implications:
- weapon skill, offense skill, and ATK bonuses have zero impact on hate 
- secondary weapons generate much less hate than primary
I linked the thread, and a related thread on shadowknight.org, in my
post titled "Agro, Hate, and Melee" if you're interested.
