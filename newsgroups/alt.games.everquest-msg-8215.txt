Yes, Impatiens has made it more clear.  To travel into High Pass and High Keep
at level 12 is one of the most dangerous things an Enchanter must do.  Yes, to
battle in those areas, you need to be into the high "teens".  Yet, as an
Enchanter, you need your pet to help protect you.

So, you are doomed, Doomed, DOOMED!  DOOMED!!!!   ....   Er, well, anyway, you
are doomed to go on a wondefully dangerous adventure into High Pass Hold and
High Pass Keep.  Ask a higher level type to help you get there.  The passages
at High Pass Hold are confusing.

Have fun - I did.  The adventure into High Pass was perhaps the most fun I had
ever, in the entire game :-)
