I'm actually pretty happy with the warrior AA skills.   I think we got a
pretty good deal this time.   Two types of damage reduction, one direct
percent increase to hit points, increased critical hits and flurry.

For warriors, the most pointless... probably Rampage.   AKA enchanter
deathtouch.   If I've got three active mobs on me at my level, things have
already went horribly wrong.  And a pointless snipe at the two I'm not
fighting isn't going to save the healer who has to cast three times as much
because all three are hitting me.

For the most completely pointless and dowright silly one... I think that has
to go to the clerics.   Divine Resurrection.  100 percent exp restore no mana
resurrection, without rez effects.  Sounds nice, right?  Refresh time, 4320
minutes.  So once every 72 hours of playing, you can do slightly better than
your epic weapon effect.  All for the low, low price of 5 Alternate
Advancement levels.
