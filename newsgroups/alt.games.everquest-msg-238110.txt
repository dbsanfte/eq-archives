Any advise for just getting to the NPC's in Barindu that give the missions?
To make a long story short, I tried to make it to Gamesh and the High
Priestess in Barindu, but thanks to a see invis mob in Barindu and the
see-invis archer in Qinimi I, and the Pally who decided to rez me, had a
great deal of aggravation with corpse recovery.  The see-invis mob in
Barindu was particularly frustrating.  I spent a lot of time scouting with
Eye of Tallon to see if there was anything that could see invis along the
corridors to the hanging gardens area (I assume there are actually hanging
gardens per my map - I never did make it that far).  The see-invis mob was
just out of the range of my eye.  I wanted to make the run to show my
guildies there was nothing to be afraid of, but that blew up in my face.  I
know that we got unlucky with the archer in Qinimi - I've made that run
several times without stumbling over him, but running into a see-invis mob
deep in Barindu is more worrying.  Was I just unlucky?
