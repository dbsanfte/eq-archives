Been reading the paper, and I have to say I'm not impressed (yes, I've
been published in a research journal myself, so that gives me license to
be snooty, or something).  They spend much more time emphasizing how the
difference in price may be because female characters are less valued due
to social stigma than they do considering whether most buyers are male and
might actually prefer to play their own gender. (They do mention this, but
it gets one sentence for every 2-3 the above possibility
does.)  Unfortunately, the gender of the buyer is not information they can
gain access to, so maybe they didn't want to go there without any data.

Lastly, the fact that they say enchanters/shaman/clerics/etc are more
financially viable than others because they are harder classes to level
made me raise an eyebrow.  My understanding is that these classes are more
valueable either because they are better as PLers or because they are
simply more needed in the end game (and in the case of the enchanter, very
good at making platinum.)
