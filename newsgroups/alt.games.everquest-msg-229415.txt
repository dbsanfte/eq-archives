Interesting. My level 2 Wizard, Frikkin, is a frog. I think the server is a
blast, but I have one question that I was not able to answer based on
looking at the ruleset: who can kill whom and where and when? Is it 100%
anything goes, anytime, anywhere, or are there racial, diety or other team
based kinds of restrictions. I'm sure this is mentioned very explicitly
somewhere, but looking over the ruleset on the Discord page I didn't see it.
The consequences don't favor much experimentation ...

TIA
