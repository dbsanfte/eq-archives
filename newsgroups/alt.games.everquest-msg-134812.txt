It IS (or more accurately, WAS) relevant because the homosexual
crusader groups liken their discrimination to that of blacks or
asians.

They claim, just like blacks, that they are born that way and should
therefore, be protected as a minority.

So, the argument as to whether it is genetics or environment wass
relevant.

However, it is NOT relevant in light of what you have brought to my
attention in these last few days...
