He wasn't be a wise ass - he was absolutely correct.

>VI should be able to tell that you died after you went LD

So what if they could? For all they know, you found yourself in a bad
fight that you knew you were going to lose, so you unplugged your
connection, hoping for a free rez.

In other words, the primary reason they don't provide a rez after
every LD is that people would just use that to cheat.

>and at least the GM's can do is respond to the petition.

Why, so they can get into a time wasting argument with you, when they
already know they're not going give you a rez?

Wise up, lad, you're not the only one on your server and the GMs have
lots of real problems to attend to.

From the EQ website, which I recommend you take a look at sometime to
reduce future incidents of making yourself look like an ass...

"Experience will not be restored for any death caused by latency
(a.k.a. "lag"), Link-Death, or other forms of disconnection."

Guides are volunteers. GMs are paid employees.

>VI could afford paid help.

If you're such an expert on the subject, maybe you should take some
time to work out what all the computers, connectivity, utilities,
office space, employees and benefits cost, while you're at it.
