1)  And you are no better than me for being selfish and wanting it on.
Oooh, what a concept.  You can disagree with me, but bitching about me being
"no better" than a bunch of racist shitheads really doesn't gain you any
points.

2)  Even if I was selfish for this (a point over which I strongly disagree),
that is not "just as bad" as being a racist.  Your sense of proportion is
underwhelming.

And why do clueless idiots gather around AoL?  The service earned it's
reputation.
