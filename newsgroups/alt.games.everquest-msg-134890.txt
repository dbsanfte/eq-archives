LOL "Fanboy" You mean all the people here who play EQ to one level or
another and don't let something like a patch day ruin their lives? Even a
screwed up patch day and lets face it, most of the Major patches are screwed
up.
The OP has played for 2 - 3 yrs, apparently, so he must have seen this
before and managed to get thru it without any serious damage.

DAoC seems to be the best of the rest but it's not for everyone, out of 6
players I know IRL who switched from EQ (excluding me) Only 1 still plays,
and 2 have now returned to EQ (I never actually quit EQ, tried DAoC for the
month but it never captured the imagination like EQ does)

My question to you is, why?
If you are no longer enjoying the game why play it at all?
Just a thought.
