Why? I believe he's talking about traders. I've set mine up and come 
back later to find a wizzie next to me and that stupid flapping bird 
right in my face. You don't NEED a familiar in the bazaar. If you want 
to practice conjuration at least have the decency to practice it 
somewhere where you're not adding to the lag of 250+ others. I think 
they should make the zone kill off all pets/familiars. Lag is bad enough 
there why add to it? Now where's my coffee??!?? ;)
