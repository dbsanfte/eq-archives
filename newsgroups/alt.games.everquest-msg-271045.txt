The usual way for warriors wasn't to sit and wait to regen. It was
bandaging yourself up to 50% - now 75% - and attack the next mob you
know you could beat with 50% health. And since you're a warrior this
thing did work.

Now you can bandage yourself up to 75% and even do this while sitting.
So if you're really hurt the progressive HP regen probably will kick in
when you're at 75%. So a few seconds later you're at full health and
ready to fight again.

Especially if you only have 20-30minutes a session. I'd think most of it
is spent in Pok finding someone to buff you.
