There's Kromrif and Kromzek, killing dwarves should raise both (I'm
dwarf/dragon so I'm not quite sure)
There's also King Tormax, which I believe killing normal dwarves doesn't
raise, you have to kill things on Dain faction (Icewell) or Yelinak (ToV,
West Wastes and Skyshrine) for that.  (at any rate, it's hard to raise
without massive dragon slaying, although if you could get a group of +Giant
people together, you could perform the dungeon crawl on Skyshrine, and maybe
get some dropped sentry armor to wear, and guardian armor for your plate
classes, as well as good Kromrif / Kromzek faction, but you're too low to
kill anything really for Tormax faction)

However, while Kael and Skyshrine have better armor than Thurgadin, the
armor pieces for both Kael and Skyshrine drop in Temple of Veeshan (West and
East (HoT) wings respectively) whereas the pieces for Thurgadin drop in
Kael, which is much easier to get to.

Also, to get armor quests in Kael or Skyshrine, you must have Ally faction,
whereas for Thurgadin you only need Kindly.

Gem components are the same for all three places for equivalent pieces.

After thinking about it though, I think I might just change to dwarf/giant
faction, at least temporarily, I want to hunt up some guardian armor with a
friend, heh.
