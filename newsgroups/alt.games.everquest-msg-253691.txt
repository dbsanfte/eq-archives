Not quite. At 40th level, a very difficult red mob is easily overcome by 
heading to dulak for a few days, and returning to the mob at 50th.

At 65th, a very difficult red mob has to be dealt with while you are 
still 65th.  At 40th, you'd just go somewhere else for a while, so if 
you're raid of 55 people can't beat him with 15 buffs... then you have 
an alternative... go elsewhere and level up, and then beat him with 15 
buffs, or level up some more and beat him in a single group with a 
ranger tanking...

At 65th, if you need more than 15 buffs... you need more than 15 buffs.
(Not quite that simple, but you get the drift of what im saying?)
