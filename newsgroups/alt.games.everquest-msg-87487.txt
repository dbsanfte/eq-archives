This is good long term group advice; however it doesnt really make
any difference until your 40's and for a group starting out thats
a long time. 

I'm of the opinion that learning you can have more fun with the
more flexible hybrids, even if later in the end game you have less
efficiency. Of course, by that point its trivial to just power level
up the classes you need anyway if you discover you're a numbers
junkie ;)
