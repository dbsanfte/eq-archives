True enough - nothing new to classes that use mana and get root.

I guess we were just impressed (with ourselves, no less!) that we
could do it using my bard's 'endless' supply of music instead of the
druid's mana.  Druid meds through the whole thing and stands to
re-cast root from time to time.  When the mob(s) dies, we go get
another.  If we get an add, we park it and the bard changes where he
stands.

Quite efficient.
