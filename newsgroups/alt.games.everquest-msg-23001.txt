I don't believe this group has a charter. It does, however have guidelines
that are accepted by the majority of regular posters.

This does not mean that you have to accept these guidelines, but you may
well be subjected to flames, of varying intensity, if you don't.

I maintain a FAQ for the newsgroup, which has a section on netiquette, that
includes some of the guidelines referred to. These are not written in stone,
and are always up for amendments, deletion and addition. I usually post this
towards the end of the month, but I can post it earlier if you wish.


Also, if a message is considered to be;
"engaging in the practice known as 'spamming';"
"engaging in unauthorized activities in relation to other peoples'
intellectual property;"

it may well be in violation of your ISP's TOS, most of which, have these
standard clauses included.


An ISP that I used to use also has this;

"Member acknowledges that prohibited conduct includes, but is not limited
to, use of the Service to invade the privacy of third parties, transmitting
via e-mail, USENET, chat service or the Member's personal web page or site,
abusive, profane, libelous, slanderous, threatening or otherwise harassing
material and posting material in any USENET or newsgroup that is off-topic
according to the charter or other public statement of the USENET or
newsgroup".

Which not only rules out this message, but also 98% of all messages on
Usenet.
