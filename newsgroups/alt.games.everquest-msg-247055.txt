I read an article in the recent issue of Games magazine about the
World of Warcraft mmorpg coming out. Seeing as how I have at least a
bit of interest in Orcs (see my .sig), I thought I'd ask if anyone
here has see this or participated in their beta, and could say
anything about the game from what you've seen or heard?

Thanks in advance
