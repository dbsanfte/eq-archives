Actually sounds like a good way to get my 60 rogue some good
AA Exp with specific mobs in a "safe" area.  Do it in N. Ro where
even a Sand giant is rare, and let a druid/BST group to charm and
buff (can you buff somebody else's charmed pet?).

You now have free level 47 mobs one at a time with absolutely
no chance of adds or wandering trouble.

'sploit aways!!!
