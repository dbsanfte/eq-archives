Risk assesment is certainly tricky. The sad part is that the science is and
has been in for a long time. Emotion however frequently gets in the way so
that people do not listen to or understand what the actual risk is. Fossil
fuel plants kill thousands every year from cancers and yet people do not
understand this . People can just not understand a risk of 1 in a million
becomming 3 in 2 million. The risk is so small that they can not understand
the increase. Even so if fossil fuel was the best choice I would go hurrah
fossil fuel because I love my computer and stove :) Since it is not the best
choice for electrical production makes sense to push what is the best
choice. The anti nuclear crowd is in large part responsible for killing
thousands every year and costing everyone who uses electricity an extra 50%,
they are doing this because nuclear makes them `feel` bad. We are still very
much a demon haunted world, the new demons are such things as nuclear power,
the cries of burn that witch can still be heard .

Our us politicians have now spent a huge amount of money ordering
vaccinations against small pox . If we give everyone in the US an
innoculation we WILL kill 600 or so people at a minimum. Is this risk worth
it?
