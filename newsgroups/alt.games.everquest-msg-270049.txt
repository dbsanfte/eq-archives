It's already happening. I overheard a conversation last night where a
group asked a warrior to link his weapon so they could decide whether
to invite him or not.  That type of player will always exist. I'm
actually kinda surprised I haven't seen more of it in WoW, I was
expecting the worst given my experiences with BNet but so far I've
been pleasantly surprised by the majority of the players. . 

Overall though, I think it will be less of a problem in WoW. Mainly
because death is much less painful so people aren't as tied to the
'holy trinity' of character classes. Personally, I'm much more likely
to try something off-the-wall if the repercussion for failing is a 5
minute corpse run instead of a 30 minute corpse run and having to
bribe a cleric to come and rez the group.  

I've heard from friends that did Beta that this will change once you
get into high level instanced dungeons where something like Rez is
needed even in WoW but not sure if anyone really knows at this point.
