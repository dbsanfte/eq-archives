First, let me off you some cheese to go with your whine.

second, GOOD FOR BLIZZARD.

1. you clearly went around the filter to get your "statement" across

2. you WERE warned (read the rules/terms)

3. don't try to spoon-feed us these bullshit definitions and story changes
trying to justify your delusion.  you used a derogatory term that you knew
was blocked (see point 1).

4. no, i don't play WoW, but I played EQ, UO and a few others and frankly
players like you RUIN THE GAME.

5. YOU WERE WRONG.

so g0 b@ck +0 p|_@yInG uR d00d GaMeZ and cry to someone who cares. pu55y
