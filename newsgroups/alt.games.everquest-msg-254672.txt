When my Iksar visits Cabilis, he often swims between places.  At
swimming 182 it seems comparable to SOW speed (I ought to measure
it sometime), and the paths are often shorter.  I've gotten pretty
good at climbing out by swimming up to the edge, angling my view
straight up, and jumping.

But the first time I went swimming after the recent big patch,
I wasn't able to climb out!  I tried several times, and each time
I jumped up and then fell back in.  I had to go find a ladder and
do it there, which worked.

I then switched to my Wizard, who as it happened was practicing
swimming in PoK when the servers went down for the patch.  I came
on and found him still in the pool, and try as I might I could not
jump him out of the pool.  I had to use Gate to get out!

I haven't tried swimming again since the followup patches.  Has
anyone else noticed this change in swimming behavior?
