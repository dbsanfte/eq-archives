Well, there are the fishbone earrings, at least two fishing poles (one drops
quite commonly near the entrance in Siren's Grottoe), tinkered rebreathers,
and my personal pride and joy

Staff of the Waterwalker.

I'll bet there are more that I'm not thinking of.  Of course the fishbone
earrings have the advantage of not occupying a weapon slot... at least
the Waterwalker is a pretty decent weapon; the fishing pole out of
SG isn't a weapon at all, which some might find a little crippling.
