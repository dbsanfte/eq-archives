So I was standing around in GD ring waiting for the last group
member to arrive, when an old friend I haven't seen in ages
shows up and greets me.  After catching up a bit, she says
"I can't believe you don't have your epic"

"Oh its here in this bag" I say, "its not much good unless you happen
to be dead"

People apparantly aren't catching on yet that any cleric over the
level of 56 has a better weapon to carry around.... or are there
still a lot of clerics who carry the thing as a badge of honor?
