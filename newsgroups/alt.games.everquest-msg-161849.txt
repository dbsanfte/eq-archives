Everyone is also forgetting a few things.... Malechite, Bonechips, tiny
daggers..... mages-necros-enchanters need a reagent to cast a pet. If a bst
dies. he can mem spells and cast a pet and be back in action. A bst can have
a pet along to assist in a CR.
Mage-Necro-Ench. cannot easily get the pet back without looting corpse

love my Troll Bst-20% towards L51
retired a 51DE necro and 56WE Druid to play my bsty
