    /em raises her hand.

    Sometime when I teach languages, I'll turn group chat off to avoid the
spam.  I can tell you can tell where this story is going to go.  Yep, me, in
group, bitching at people with more and more venom about their lack of
communication skills.  I was spouting stuff like "Look, if none of you can even
say ONE WORD while we're doing this so we can operate, maybe we should all go
solo!"

   I sincerely hope they took that opportunity to talk about what a jerk I was
before someone sent me a /tell clueing me in.
