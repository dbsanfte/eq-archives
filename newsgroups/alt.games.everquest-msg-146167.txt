I just became level 43 two nights but haven't played since, so I'm not sure where 
I'll hunt next. For the last 8 levels or so I've been quadding zelniaks in 
Dawnshroud Peak though. They're docile, stay out of wolf form and you can grab up 
four easily because they aren't agro and aren't social. I did zelniaks first with 
a large zelniak here and there, then eventually only large zelniaks. Once I 
became level 43 some of the large zelniaks are only light blue now though, so I 
might need to find a new place to hunt.
