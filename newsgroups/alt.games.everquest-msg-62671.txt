So, can you guys explain to me the point of playing on Rallos Zek if
you dont take the time to nuke an idiot like this into oblivion?  Why
bother going PvP if you cant use it on some idiot when they waste your
time?  Isnt that the benefit after all?  You've lived your life in
constant fear of PKs, the only possible benefit being that you can get
(or at least attempt!)  revenge when you desire it.

Again, why not rez her and then PK her just for spite?  Or just PK her
and be done with it without wasting mana on the rez....

Sam / Kad
Still dont 'get' PvP...
