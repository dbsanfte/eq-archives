3 groups, with key members 55+

The most important class here is the chanter (well chanter and puller)

At minimum, a chanter and warrior over 55.. individual classes - well when
its been just 3 groups left, thats because everbody left.. not because I
planned 3 groups, so they werent optimal

3 clerics, 2+ chanters, monk, rogue, wizard, 2 druids, 3 warriors - for
minimum i think.. if you have another wizard or 2, then add those (3
wizards, 2 druids and 2/3 chanters is plenty of stunnage and pb ae to do ae
pulls) and assorted melee damage, that leaves 2/3 spots to juggle about..
paladin, shaman and ranger would work

If your warriors and clerics were experienced together (also being a warlord
helps) then you could drop a warrior for a damage dealer (monk or rogue) if
you don't have the wizards available, make sure you have suitable damage
dealers in their place (mages, rogues, monks, rangers) chardok is about
moving fast and not getting caught in repops
