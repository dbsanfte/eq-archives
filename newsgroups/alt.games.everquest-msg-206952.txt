Shissar bow is a great bow; I know a ranger who used one to 60.  With
half-decent arrows, it will hit in the 30s; you can just about one-shot XP
mobs, and two shots will kill anything blue to you.  If you want better,
look into Recurved Velium - but honestly, you don't need it.

Fleeting is currently the best quiver in game.  Not an item SOE spent much
effort on.  The weight reduction is not quite the same as the delay
reduction, but it's proportional.  The Fleeting is listed as a 60 pct weight
reduction; it's about a 20 pct delay reduction if I recall correctly.  If
I'm wrong, I'm sure I'll be corrected (to borrow a phrase).

Remove your melee weapons, remove and re-equip your bow, and you'll know
what your ATK is with archery.

Haste does affect archery, as does ATK.  Haste will affect how often you try
to hit, ATK will affect how often you DO hit.  AGI has nothing to do with
anything archery related.  As Graeme says, if the ranger is haste capped,
more ATK is the way to go - even if they're not capped, firing at 90 pct
haste with +40 ATK will generate more damage than 100 pct haste with no
added ATK.

Nope, no double attacks with bows.

Rangers only get crits with bows until they train AAs.  Warriors get crits
with any melee weapon.  However, rangers will typically (almost always)
outdamge a warrior with identical weapons.

Rangers can get double damage from non-moving, non-rooted mobs with
bowshots.  It doesn't happen often, but it happens; think of it like a
procc.  On an ubermob, with Trueshot running, it can be devastating.  At
level 2, I wouldn't get too excited about it.  Bowshots can break root, so
consider rooting, backing up, healspamming yourself, then shooting again.

As for the wall thing - if any part of the mob is in a piece of geometry
(wall, tree, another mob) then you cannot hit it with a bow UNLESS a part of
YOUR toon is in the same geometry.  If a mob gets walled, stick your toe in
the wall.  If a mob gets cornered or in a tree, wait until it moves or melee
away.

My group had a ranger for MA until about 47; that's when we recruited a
warrior.  For the record, that was with a druid and a shaman healing; no
cleric heals, no cleric buffs.  The shaman rerolled a warrior, and I took
care of debuffs and slows (enchanter).

Not that I know of.
