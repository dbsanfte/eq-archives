There will be people trying for old spots, but the new zones will be
swamped.  Often i found people moving into permacamped areas for first
time type thing when kunark went live.  Velious just emptied the old
world dungeons pretty much, except for the usual Lower Guk and Sol B. 
any others that were iffy to begin with, became a definite BYOG dungeon.
