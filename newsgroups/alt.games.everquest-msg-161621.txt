I cannot speak to post-50 spells (my Druid is 31), but Flame Lick
and Immolate stack with one another.  I was surprised by this as
both have an AC debuff, I wonder if the debuff effect is stacking
or if only the larger has effect (like with Augmentation and other
Haste buffs where the haste component of Augmentation is overridden
by a faster haste while the AGI boost and STA regen remain active).
