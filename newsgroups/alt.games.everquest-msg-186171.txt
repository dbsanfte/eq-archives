The government cannot tax capital gains unless there is a capital
gains increase.  Under Clinton, the government vastly overstated GDP
numbers and companies vastly overstated earnings, which you guessed
it, caused the stock indexes and value of private businesses to keep
skyrocketing well beyond when they should have leveled off.  Only when
companies could no longer lie, and when the state of the economy was
shown as it was, did the stock market began dropping.  When that
happened, revenues dropped.

Meanwhile, investors kept investing in startups and adding capital to
existing companies, allowing them to continue hiring.  More employed =
more income tax revenues.  When companies could no longer lie, when
they started declaring bankruptcy because their once junk-rated debt
was now worthless, when the BEA fessed up about GDP, guess what
happened to all of that capital?  What effect do you think that had on
those jobs?

Why?  Both are acts of war.  Clinton attacked sovereign nations
without the consent of the UN.  He did so to punish terrorists and
force regime changes.  It worked (or may have, we have yet to see the
ultimate result) in one nation, failed in all the rest.

If they kept the 'theoretical design phase' working, can you explain
why, if they supposedly never intended to proliferate from 1994
through 2002?  They took our bribes, including the construction of 2
power facilities and enough fuel oil to cover the energy production of
their forbidden plant...and kept right one developing nuclear or other
mass destruction weapons.

You mean they turned it on until the US Government _caught_ them.

You just got done claiming the world had a positive view of the US.

Oh so the world hates us for being the haves, rather than because Bush
is a Republican...

Maybe Bush should send some fuel to France, and build them a few power
plants.  He would have to pay them quite a bit though, since they have
a large economic interest in seeing Saddam Hussein remain in power.

Can you explain which Clinton policies created our 'miracle' economy?

Was it the Republican-supported, Democrat-opposed NAFTA?
Was it the Republican policy of deregulation?
Perhaps it was the Republican welfare reform bill?
Maybe it was those spending cuts that Clinton fought against?
