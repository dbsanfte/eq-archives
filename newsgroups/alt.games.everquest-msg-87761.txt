Evade works as soon as you can "hide."

I'm NOT a proponent of having Evade hot-keyed.
Why? Timing.

If you're fighting something and draw aggro, it's
got a good chance of whacking you when you try
to use an "Evade" hotkey.  It's much better timing for
me personally to manually stop attacking, wait until
I'm both 1)not moving, and 2)not hit, manually Hide,
and then start attacking again.

It "seems" more involved, but then again the only
times I miss evade now are the times when it just
simply fails due to the random number generator.
When I was hot-keying it, it seems to get interrupted
a LOT due to the timing being off.

Can pick any lock in Befallen with a skill of 11.  Doors will
take you all the way to max level 50+ skills.  Door in E. FP
for Burning Rapier quest can't be picked successfully until
skill 122 or so, and can also take you to max skill.  The
fun door is the N. FP bank door, which cannot be picked until
skill is 201, which cannot happen until level 51+.  It also takes
skills to max.

You CANNOT get a skill up on a door you cannot already open.
Spend some more time in Befallen :-).

You can skill up PickPocket, Disarm, and Instill Doubt on
the greenest of greens. I usually used the goblins in Misty
Thickets, since they always carry coin, and have just enough
hitpoints not to run away when I aggro'd them with "disarm."
They had enough hps to survive an "accidental" riposte or
two, also :-).

Back in the day, that was the thing to do.  Swap your Serrated Bone
Dirk out for backstabs with your Glowing Iron Pike for the bigger Backstab
damage.  It didn't matter because you had to get the most backstab
damage in you could because you couldn't evade and missed backstabs
had about as much aggro as a Complete Heal :-).

Now, there are so many good piercing weapons it's simply not worth
it.  Heck, on my server a Crystalline spider fang goes for around 800
to 1000 pp, and it's 10/22 with a DD proc and some stats.  Slime-coated
harpoons are even cheaper and 10/25, so there are plenty of good weapons
out there for cheap.
