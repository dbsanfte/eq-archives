Rise of Nations has an interesting twist on this that I'm enjoying.  The
"Conquer the World" option is a combination of Risk and Red Alert.  You
start with a country as your capital on a real-world map. On your turn, you
choose to attack a neighboring country (there is faction involved).  Once
the attack has begun, it's played out as a Red Alert type RTS
(gather/build/rush).  It's handled really well .. Big Huge Games has done a
good job with this.

Same here.  That's normally when I fire up Halo on the Xbox. ;-)
