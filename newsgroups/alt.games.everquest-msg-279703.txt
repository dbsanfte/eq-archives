So I bit the bullet and bought EQ Platinum Pack (1st 7 expansion) OoW and 
DoN (total cost $65 CDN). After installing it (about 90 minutes total, 
including signing up for a Station Pass and patching the game) I started. 

Rolled up a barbarian beastmaster (of course, this was before I read any of 
the sites thoughtfully provided elsewhere in this group). I added the 20 
points to my stats a bit differntly than that recommended, but that 
shouldn't affect me too much.

He is currently working his way through the Gloomingdeep tutorial, and has 
made his way up to level 5. Still no beasts yet, but from reading up I see 
he actually gets them as abilities starting at around 9. 

So far, with only 2 attacks (he just got kick) combat is, well, boring as 
compared to CoH and Guild Wars, but I expect that will change as I get more 
abilities.
