As far as I know Merchants won't attack other NPC's if your being attacked,
at least it has never saved my sorry butt *). I don't think anyone including
guards will save you from Gix, I ran to the gate were the guards hang out
one time when I was being killed by him, not the only time he killed me, and
they stood there watching him kill me. I'm not sure but I think they took
him out for a drink afterwards. I don't know if that is because he had
better faction with them at that time then I do or if they never kill him.

I learned my lesson now I zone if he comes after me, I haven't been in WC in
a few levels now but I doubt I could take him. Even better for my little
ranger is to look for him on track, but that would do you no good
what-so-ever.
