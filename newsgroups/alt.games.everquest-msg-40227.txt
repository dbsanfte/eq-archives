A few days ago, I was on a return boat ride from Freeport with a few of my
friends when we were joined by a Monk.  While my friends and I were busy
spaming each other, the Monk was practicing his attacks.   I thought it
looked pretty cool, so I just created a Monk of my own, but I can't figure
out how to practice....   How's it done?
