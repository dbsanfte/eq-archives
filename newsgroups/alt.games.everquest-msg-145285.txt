First, I'm not the government. I am not bound by constitutional law
respecting establishment or exercise of religion. That pretty much
negates the comparison.

Second, the Ten Commandments do not stand alone. They represent the
entire doctrine and dogma of the Christian faith, and so to many of us
they represent centuries of hatred, mistreatment, violence and
oppression.

>Is it possible that you're reading hostility that isn't there?

Looking at the Christian rhetoric in recent cases, no, I think I'm
right on the money. I'm getting very sick of narrow minded bigots
claiming this is a Christian country. It is not.
