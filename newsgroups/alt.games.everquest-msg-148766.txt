Hello,

 I saw many posts (wrongly presented) on the internet about CRT vs. LCD...

 What puzzles me is that most people compare 19" CRT to 17" LCD.
 that's not really "comparable", it's way better to compare monitors
 in same price range (not by inches), so, if one is willing to pay,
 say, $800 for a good 17"/18" LCD, why compare to 19" CRT?

 Only fair would be to compare it to the best available 22" CRT monitor,
 for which costs are even lower than $800!! But from this standpoint
 I think 22" CRT wins way down, if not for anything else, it's as big
 as 20" LCD! Moreover, those TOP rated 22" CRTs do not have
 shortcomings which are usual for cheap/medium priced CRTs!!

 Since you know that photos demand high resolutions for viewing/editing,
 there is one VERY important thing to mention --- that with 22" CRT like
 'ViewSonic P225f' you can even view photos in ACTUAL (1:1) resolution
 if you have a 5MP (2560x1920) digital camera or high scanned photos!!


 Below you can see my list of top candidates, I gathered
 that list by carefully reading tens of online reviewers from:
 PCWorld.com, CNET.com, Cadalyst.com, ZDNet.com,
 SmartComputing.com, PCMag.com, TomsHardware.com,
 NeoSeeker.com,  AnandTech.com, ConsumerSearch.com,
 PCStats.com and some others, plus users reviews...

 |||------- CRT 22" ------->   1) $650,  2) $550,  3) $750
  1) ViewSonic P225f (0.25mm,2048x1536@79Hz,2560x1920@63Hz)
  2) Samsung 1200NF (0.24,1600x1200@85Hz,2048x1536@75Hz)
  3) Mitsubishi 2070SB (0.24,1600x1200@85Hz,2048x1536@86Hz)

  Note: first resolution is recommended/optimal, second is max res.

 |||------- LCD 17" ------->   1) $850,  2) $800,  3) $700
  1) Samsung 171P (DVI,Pivot,25ms,cr500,170/170,1280x1024)
  2) Iiyama AS4332UT (DVI,Pivot,35ms,cr350,160/160,1280x1024)
  3) Philips 170B2T (DVI,Pivot,40ms,c400,160/160,1280x1024)

  Note1: cr500 means Contrast Ratio of 500:1; 170/170 is viewing angle
  Note2: Add about $150 for 18" & $250 for 19" LCD, same 'LOW' resolution!
  (Samsung 172T=$700, 181T=$850, 191T=$950 at cheapest online shops!!)

 |||------- CRT 19" ------->   1) $350,  2) $300,  3) $400
  1) Samsung 900NF (0.25,1280x1024@85Hz,2048x1536@69Hz)
  2) ViewSonic P95f+ (0.25mm,1280x1024@101Hz,2048x1536@68Hz)
  3) Iiyama Pro 454 (0.25mm,1280x1024@90Hz,2048x1536@80Hz)


 The problem is that right around the corner (early in 2003) there is
 new technology coming for LCD monitors, called "Feed-Forward",
 which will make LCDs much faster (around 16ms), which would
 mean they will get fast enough for any fast actions DVD movies
 and speedy games. And it's not just that those new kind of LCDs
 will be faster, but it ALSO means that current LCDs will most
 certainly drop in price -- in my opinion from 15% to 30% or more.

 See about new technology: "Feed Forward Makes LCDs Faster"

 So, I don't think it's smart to buy LCD just now, but rather to
 wait at least for few months... Likewise, wouldn't be good to
 buy 22" CRT now, since it costs TWICE more than 19" CRT!!

 My opinion is to buy good 19" CRT now, and later, in about
 6 months or so, either sell it or keep it as second monitor along
 new FFD enabled 18" LCD. Especially for Photoshop work,
 where there are many toolbars, it's good to have two monitors.

 Let me know what you think about my thoughts and
 what is your own opinion on all this...

 Good luck!
