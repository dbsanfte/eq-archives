Hey all,

I just got my eq gold pack in today. Grand whoops all around.

I am still running my athlon 700 256mb tnt2 ultra winXP machine, but now
with velious and luclin.
The game is running, I can move and the choppyness appears to be present but
controlable.

I have few of the new models on, among which horses.

When I installed I chose to install the retextured zones. This might have
been a bad idea, although I couldn't find much info on it.

I switched of the grass.

I'm running on low quality at high res.

Anything I missed? Anymore tweaks? What was that umbra thingy again?
