That is precisely where I think they should be making more effort. I
really don't expect SOE to take IGE and Yantis to court.  I do strongly
encourage them to design a game with mechanism that make plat/item sales
less lucrative, and perhaps design the game such that the motivation to
buy items/plat is less.  

It is much harder to take away the motivation to buy characters,
though.  Making it so that characters are very customizable and cannot be
changed (ala CoH) would at least discourage those buyers who care what
their character looks like.  Not sure you can do much to discourage those
who only care about level/class/skills though.
