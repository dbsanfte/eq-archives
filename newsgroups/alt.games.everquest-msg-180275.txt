I am guessing (and I *do not* mean this offensively) that English
is not your first language.  It seems like you totally misunderstood
Dark Tyger.  He is not saying non-whites are sub-human.

He was talking about SUBSETS.  For example, red is a SUBSET of all
visible colors.  Orange is a SUBSET of all visible colors.  Etc.

Likewise, asians are a SUBSET of the human races.  Caucasians are
a SUBSET of the human races.  Etc.

Honestly, his comment was not racist.  Perhaps it was not worded as
well as it could have been, but it was certainly not racist.

P.S. Is it just me, or are people WAY to trigger happy when it comes
     to accusing people of being a racist lately?
