AAs always require the same amout of exp, no matter what level you
are. That's the main reason that most people recommend waiting until
65 before seriously working on AAs, it's a lot easier to get 100,000
exp points at 65 than at 51. 

You really can't go wrong spending the 3 AAs to get run3 early but
after that it's probably best for most classes to get to 65 before
getting any more. Exception being if you want to put off leveling for
a bit while friends/guildies catch up.
