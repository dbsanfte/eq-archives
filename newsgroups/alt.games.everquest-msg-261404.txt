At 57, but also after a small secondary patch I think, I was again able 
to single pull the sphinxes, even though by now they are KOS to me; I 
went in room to set up to kill the second one and he aggroed on me 
before I got into optimal position (on non KOS mobs, I can get in the 
rear arc and open with stun, so my first few seconds of combat avoid 
dodge/parry/block/riposte, which admittedly isn't a huge deal, 4 seconds 
of 15% higher average damage)

I can't tell, of course, whether the aggro got fixed with that patch, or 
whether I simply needed one more level than I did before.
