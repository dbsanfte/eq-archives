I tend to use Root, Scourge, Venom of the Snake, Curse of the Spirits
and then nuke with the JBB.  Downtime is acceptable and killing
wyverns in Cobalt Scar is probably the best place to do this routine
(as long as you are not KOS to Skyshrine).  

Don't sick your pet on it till you have it down to 50% or less and
then toss a slow on it.
