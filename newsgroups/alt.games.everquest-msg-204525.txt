Well, there's a net or web with two charges of snare on it that drops from the
spiders down in CC, other than that, nothing comes to mind but the advise
"group with a snarer".

My cleric got a staff that procs ensnare, drop off Tunare (Sap Encrusted
Branch, I think its called) but I've only used it as a stunt, I got it too
late in life to actually use it for fear kiting.  Hmm, perhaps not, with the
new exp changes, in the old world there may now be exp mobs I can tank a third
of the way waiting for it to proc, then fear and give chase.

I don't see a chanter pulling that off as a soloing plan, though, and I don't
think the branch is chanter equippable anyway.
