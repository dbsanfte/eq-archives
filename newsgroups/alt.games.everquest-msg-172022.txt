WTF are you talking about?  This mob possibly has the best risk versus
reward in the entire game.  A really really nice hybrid belt with 20 AC, 15
Wis, Int, Str and Sta and 100 to HPs and Mana for example.  Never seen him
drop gloves of any sort.

Port in, kill, sort loot, port out in less time it would take to kill one
yard trash VT mob.
