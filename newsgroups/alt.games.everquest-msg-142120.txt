Re-read what Hughes wrote. He argues that the US is not a pure 
capitalist society anymore, and I said that that was because pure, 
cutthroat capitalism was found to suck.

As for your second statement, I think you got it backwards. The US 
certainly has the strongest economy in history, and one of the best 
standards of quality of life. The best? Well, if you believe that, I 
think that you haven't travelled enough yet. :)

And the reason why the standard of life is so good is because it climbed 
down from undiluted capitalism towards a regime with a bit more of a 
social conscience.

I'm not talking about welfare, I'm talking about children as young as 
six working in mines. I've been down mines, and I've seen the tunnels.

Always a pleasure.
