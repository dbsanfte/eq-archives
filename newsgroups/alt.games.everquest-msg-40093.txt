Huh?  Bards get sneak.  Bards can also buy a couple invis to undead
potions and then stealth their way into the zone.  Bards get several
rogue-like skills, more than other characters, and I've alwasy played
my bard as a sort of a seedy, rougish type.  I did wait until I was
level 21 to go to lower guk and get my mask, but it was one of the
most exciting things I ever did in EQ.  I can't believe anyone waited
2 days for the mask to drop either, ASS/SUP is almost always camped in
Lower Guk on Innoruuk, and the mask drops every couple hours or so.
One thing you may want to do is to go to Lower Guk at peak hours with
a handful of invis undead potions, and work your way to the room.  If
someone is waiting in line, ask if you can be next and just camp out
there.  Play another character, but every 30 minutes or so give a tell
to whomever is waiting for it.  If your turn comes up, log on your
bard, wait for your drop, invis undead and head to zone.  If your turn
doesn't come up, no big deal.  Leave the bard camped there, play other
characters.  Do a /who all 40, 41, etc until you find someone in Lower
Guk.  Send them a tell asking if they could see if ASS/SUP is camped,
and then get a name of someone in the group.  Ask them if someone is
waiting, then log in your bard if nobody is.
