I saw something last week that has me questioning whether he isn't
correct about that. I'm hesitant to read too much into a 3 hour exp
hunt but here's the situation. My 40th lvl warrior grouped with a
friends 42nd lvl paladin in Gunthak, hunting undead. With the paladin
not taunting, I often lost agro if I waited to taunt. Mob would turn
to pally and I'd hit my taunt to (usually) get it back on me. The
times where I was hitting taunt as soon as it cycled, I wouldn't ever
loose agro. From those fights it certainly appeared that a successful
taunt was adding to my hate even when I was at the top of the hate
list.

Rgds, Frank
