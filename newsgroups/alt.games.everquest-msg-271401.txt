The need for a bigger mana pool arises when you get the 61+ mezzes.
Bliss(64) costs about 300m and unless you have changed your
specialisation my bet is you are specialized in alteration - so no mana
savings on mezzes. So without raid gear&foci your mezzes will suck you
dry literally. Then you'll be pleased with every int+ and mana+ gear you
have. :D

And there are fights where your group relies on you to hold a few mobs
just a few seconds longer. ;)
