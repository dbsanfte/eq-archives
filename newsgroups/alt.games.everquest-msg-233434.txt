Don't even need the druid for most PoP xp grouping.  I have done many LDoN 
adventures with shaman/druid, as well as many xp groups that way, or with 
just me for slowing, healing, and hasting.  I have not yet done an LDoN 
without a druid or cleric though, been meaning to try it, but most people 
are too concerned with winning to want to try it.
