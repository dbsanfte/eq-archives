Yep, that would also be going too far.  But I wouldn't call that
"leapfrogging".

Perhaps its a definition thing; to me, Leapfrogging is going in
past a raid (or group or individual) which has started moving
with sufficient force, killing entry mobs and so forth in
preparation for the kill, taking advantage of those partial
preparations (or even just ignoring them because your raid has a
force that can take the target without the preliminary clearing).

If you don't have the force to take a mob down, whether you can
claim it or not depends on your server's politics.  Some servers
let you claim a mob and at least allow you reasonable time to get
ready for it, some demand you engage immediately even if you
can't hope to really finish the job until help arrives, others
say if you aren't ready to do the whole job NOW (using the person
questioning your readiness's judgement on that) then you don't
have the mob engaged.

These questions are some of my least favorite aspects of EQ, and
I particularly depise the way SOE has abandoned any idea of
clarifying the issues.
