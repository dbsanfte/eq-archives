 I didn't get that impression. The first was good, and it was
establishing the story and all, but it was still a little heavy and slow
paced for my liking. TTT gets things moving and livens up some of the
more heavy moments.

 It's actually been awhile since I've read the books so I'll pass on
this complaint. I've seen a lot of people mention it though so I'll take
their word for it.

 I had that same thought. You'd think Ents would know what's going on.
How did the Hobbits have any idea what Saruman had done to the
surrounding forest and the Ents didn't?

 I found her fairly hot myself. I guess it's a personal thing. I
wouldn't pass up the opportunity to do some swordplay with her. I almost
said "a little swordplay" but that didn't sound quite right.

 I'll agree with the Cate thing. I don't presonally find her all that
attractive but I suppose some others do. Liv annoys me in all the movies
I've seen her in but she's nice to look at all the same. As for Eowyn,
as above, I find her to be a babe! Rawr!

 And? Who cares. Isn't Ian Mckellan gay as well? I though I picked that
up in one of the commentaries but I suppose I could have been imagining
things. But really, what bearing does anyones personal life have in the
movie? I'd say about zero.
