Hehe - we took out this bit...err genteel lady last night with two groups in
the level 50-55 range plus one L60 chanter (not mezzing) in 67 seconds flat.
It's nice to have snare and fear in your group, and the KEI kept the casters
dotting and nuking away, I haven't seen a mob this high level go down so
fast and so smoothly in a long time.
