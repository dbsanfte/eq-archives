I second this suggestion.  My main just finished getting a whole set of
Lightcrawler armor for my dwarf rogue and it looks fabulous!  It's a
green-gold color (at least in old graphics mode) and for small races only
(gnm, dwf, hfl).  And has super stats.  I wonder why more people don't
wear/sell this.  I don't think I have ever seen it auctioned before.
