Nope it was not my news media - I prefer a little more in depth analysis
than they provide. Well I suggest you read " Inside Al Qaeda - Global
Network of Terror" by Rohan Gunaratna ( an Indian from India and one of the
foremost experts on Al Qaeda) and " Afghanistan - Lifting the Veil" by the
staff of Reuters. Now that is who told me - who told you?
Oh you might want to try " Soldiers of God" too.
