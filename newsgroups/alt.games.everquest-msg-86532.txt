No, it all goes to you, looting a corpse is not like looting a mob.

Ignoring the xp bonus of groups the advantage of grouping is simple, kill
rate. You can take down a mob on your own, fine, most can under 20th but you
will be damaged, use mana etc and have downtime, now if you had a healer and
nuker with you, you'd be dropping mobs much faster with hardly any downtime
on top of that you could try your hand at tougher mobs for more exp and
better loot.

With financial help you could easily solo at your level but it won't last
and you really want to learn to play the character within a group early on
because solo'ing is not an easy thing for a Tank.
