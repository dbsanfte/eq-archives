There's a shoe merchant in Qeynos that sells them. For some reason,
they saw fit to put them only on special footwear merchants rather
than the general cloth merchants.

I'm sure I've seen them for sale in Freeport... Check Erudin for tiny
daggers. If all else fails, I beleive the Erudite merchant in the last
inn on the path before West Commons in East Commons sells them.

You're pretty defenseless even with the pet, though. ;-p Enchanter
animations might as well be paper bags.

Wow. If a little difficulty finding 2 items on merchants is all it
takes to drive you away, you're not going to be happy with *any* MMOG
out there...
