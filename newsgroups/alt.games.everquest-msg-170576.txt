}It'd sure be nice if they did indeed hold up this change.  Now, on Test,
}instead of using a third-party product that allows you to two-box on one
}machine with EQ set up the way you want it, they've killed that (EQw
}doesn't work properly, keyboard is ignored) and replaced it with crap
}that (1) changes your EQ screensize to some arbitrary setting (800x600 I
}think it was) screwing up your UI layout in the process, 
}(3) uses your desktop resolution
}instead of your selected EQ resolution when you switch it back to full-
}screen mode,

I found (once I got it working) that it worked exactly like my dog said 
EQW works.

}(2) dies if you start a second copy of EQ (already running instance 
}poofs) so that you cannot two-box on a single machine,

Well... My dog got one copy of testeq and one copy of EQ-EQW running 
simultaneously this morning. Opening a second EQ-EQW made everything go 
cacky and poof though.

}and (4) is buggy as all hell (had to log twice to clear
}something screwy with the keyboard).

No argument there. :)
