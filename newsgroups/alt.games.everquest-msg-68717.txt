The debate has been quite a while ago (at least a month) so don't worry
about it.

What'll happen if it hits zero?  He'll whine until someone zings him...they
all do. :)

The only good response is to tell him "don't worry about it, ya big baby."
Lord knows *I* have enough trouble deciding on spells to mem, I don't have
room for a STA regen buff that's not even needed.  I regularly yell at tanks
who have low STA...they're too much trouble. :p
