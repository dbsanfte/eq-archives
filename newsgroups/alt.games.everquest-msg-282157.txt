It does EQ no harm at all, and keeps it alive by giving people a reason to
carry on playing, especially casual players who might well of given up a
long time ago due to time constraints, therefore being able to buy plat to
buy gear to be able to play in the latest zones is a good thing.

I wouldn't do it, but can see how it helps EQ.

If people have no reason to play, they wont play.

Its wrong in gaming terms, ie, people should have to earn what they have,
but in a game EQ's age, for a newbie just starting out, that is not really
possible.  Who would want to spend 5 years getting to the stage of people
playing now?  Nobody.  Unless they enjoy soloing alot I guess.
