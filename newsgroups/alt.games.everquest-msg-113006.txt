    One of our necromancers had a stalker. She created a necromancer with
the exact same name as him less one letter, then started talking to him. She
e-mailed him a picture of herself (middle-aged woman), she followed him
around, she even let herself be sacrificed by him for an Essence Emerald so
"a part of her would always be with him". It recently became so bad that a
GM was brought in, and by mutual decision she got her name changed and
stopped contacting my guildmate.
