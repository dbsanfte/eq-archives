How about a fee (say, 149.95?) that will level you to 50 and max all your
skills?  For the casters, you get all spells to level and for warriors, a
full suit or quest armor (or planar) plus a set of level appropriate weapons
(ok, a menu with prices for the weapons and armor seems fair).  We know that
plat is $10.00 per 1k, you can buy up to 10k plat, also.
