Okay. my bard started in Kelethin, Greater Faydark. There will be a few
things there you can still hit; Ebon masked Spy, Orc Arsonist and their
mates for exp.

Crushbone took me to 20. Try the Orc Trainer on top of the hill and
slavers on west and east side., Then join the Throne Room group when you
can. Split when the Legos go green. Although there are still Emissarys,
and the Warlord, plus ambassador Dvinn, they are much higher level and
hard to extract without a pile of legos. Take a crack at Rentlon without
his pet if you can.

Low 20s, Dagnors Cauldron would still offer stuff and a group in the
Estate of Unrest, althought chances of dieing in Unrest are very high.

I've basically taken my Bard from 20+ to 30 in High Keep Castle in the
Goblin Room Group, then the Warrior Room Group.

You can vary this with a group in South Karan camping the Splitpaw
entrance, although this is harder to get into.
