No, aggro is linked to the potential damage caused by each swing (not
actual, btw, so missing still generates aggro).  Better ratios tend to mean
higher potential damage over any given period and so give greater hate
generation over the same period.

Note however that slow hard hitting two handed weapons can give a big aggro
punch at the start of a fight, but get overtaken by faster, better ratio'd
one-handed weapons.
