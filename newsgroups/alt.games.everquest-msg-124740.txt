As for the websites, heres a few that I found usefull:

http://necro.eqclasses.com/
http://www.geocities.com/necromancer_realm/
http://www.terra.es/personal2/eqnecro/
http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Crater/3074/

...and then of course

http://eq.castersrealm.com/menu/necromancer.asp

As for the race - It probably more an issue of selecting the one that
will make you least hated. As another poster wrote, Gnomes are
probably the best bet here.

That said - I would recommend you to select the one that makes you
feel good. Stats are not everything - having fun is.

I chose Iksar myself - Yes I know ... not the brightest torch in the
cave, and everyone and their mother hates you but...

- Infravision
- You swim better than most fish out there.
- A nice AC bonus from the scales.
- High hp regeneration, which comes in handly while using Dark Pact,
or later Lich form.

and finally.

- You are not hated everywhere. There are places outside Kunark where
you can find places to hunt, bank and trade safely.


Good luck in your travels.
