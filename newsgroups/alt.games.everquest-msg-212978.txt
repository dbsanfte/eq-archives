Wow, that would be very stupid.  All waves should be attributed to the 
caster.  The problem would then arise when the caster LDed or zoned 
during the rain.

For mobs under 20, that could be killed with rain spells, I can say that 
they die, and do not poof, if the caster (me) is still there.  Can't say 
for if the caster LDs or zones before the mob is killed by the rain or 
DoT for that matter.

The same issue would arise for DoTs as for rains, if the caster zoned or 
LDed, the damage becomes unattributed.
