Other players can bind you if they are a shaman or druid.  The easiest way is
to talk to the soulbinder in south Qeynos at the bank.
Next time you are in Surefall tho - and you'll make lots of trips back and
forth:  there's a gal just as you come in the door at the "water lodge".  Click
on her and hail her.  She will talk about some mail she needs delivered to
qeynos.  Say "I will deliver mail to qeynos".  She will give you a letter to
take to a specific bard at the bards guild in South Qeynos.  The "hail" key is
probably already set up under "socials".  (Or type H and hit enter...)
This will build faction and you get some cash too...
