Ideally, honor should come in here at some point. You already won a monk
mask with an hp upgrade, bow out of the roll and let the other monk have it.
Or, if you win, GIVE your old mask to the monk, since it would be a 40, 50,
or by now 60 hp upgrade for him. Random rolls work, but only if all
participants are fair about it.
