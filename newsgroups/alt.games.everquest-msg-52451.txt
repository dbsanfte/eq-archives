Don't go in there during the day.  There is an ogre and a barbarian
woman on Steel Warriors faction and you will be kos to them.  At night
you should be fine.
I belive they despawn at 6pm, and respawn at 9 am but not positive on
those times.

I am not sure if it is a waste of time or not, I will say I have rarely
seen him in the tavern at all so.  I do know that killing the place
holders will generally lower your faction with the groups you are trying
to raise.

this is an easy quest to do.  Just time consuming.  Pick up the notes
from the rogue guild.  I think they will give them at apprehensive, not
sure about dubious.  Turn in the notes, and then return the items.  You
get exp twice turning in the note and returning the item they give you. 
You only get the faction for returning the items.  I don't remember if I
could do the third leg of that quest or not, the halfling in the rogue
guild would have you take a note to his sister in N.FP and she gives you
something to return to him, which again is when you get your faction.  A
dark elf shadowknight can do the first to parts without ever having
killed a deathfist orc.  As for the monks while i am guessing as a human
you will start dubious, but it's not a concern, you don't get close
enough to aggro them doing the janam and rebby quests.

You are dubious to the bards i believe, and can actually do the note
quests, however you may be kos in the other cities to get the notes.  I
know at dubious with my Erudite Necro I could do the bard quests, and
the one time i was fool enough to take my DE sk to NFP, I was only
dubious to the bards, but then a Knight of truth rounded the corner and
i was smeared across the zone.
