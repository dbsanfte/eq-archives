AND medding mana back, that's the real timesink.

All the home cities are either 1 zone, or 2 zones from PoK and in all 
cases very short walks. You're talking like they're in Dulak or something.

Fully buffing a group and medding back to full takes several minutes.

Hmmm.... no.

It takes me a whopping 26 seconds to get from my Tribute NPC to the PoK. 
  If your stipulating I'm getting buffed in the PoK anyways then 
complaining about a trip home is ludicrous. Worst case is maybe 
Gukta...where it takes about 2 minutes...

But seriously, you pay your tribute prices every 10 minutes. There isn't 
too much of the game left that takes that long to reach, I'm sorry your 
argument that you can't get your value out of it just doesn't hold 
water. worst case you blow a few (hundred) lousy tribute points getting 
where you want to go. Big deal, one or two junk items wasted... and 
that's as a lowbie... sure if your jacked up to high heaven on tribute 
it might be a problem if you are finding it a burden it just means your 
spending more than you can (or want to) afford.

Its my opinion that tribute was not intended to be minmaxxed the way you 
would like to play it. I beleive they intended you to turn on some 
stuff, play for a few weeks, and drop back to re-fill your tribute points.

My lowbie bard plays it like that (46th... ok... she's officially 
midgame now imo) has FT2 on permanently and has no trouble affording it.

I think Its a pain-in-the-ass to continually tweak tribute on purpose. 
They never intended it as a way to let everyone have flip FT5 on and off 
whenever it would be convenient.

And finally, fwiw, the current implementation, plays to the lore pretty 
well... which is pretty amazing for EQ.

Probably.
