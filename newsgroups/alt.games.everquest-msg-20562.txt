In my case at least you're incorrect.

Several of my friends are people I first met online, via BBSs (I ran
one for six years and participated in the Fido community for much
longer) and chat systems. I've met them all face to face, countless
times. I've attended their weddings, funerals, parties and informal
gatherings. Heck, one of them even got me the job I have today.

The interesting thing is that some of them, had I met first in person
rather than online, I probably would have given no second thought to.
Meeting them online allowed me to find out who they really were,
rather than what they looked like.

In my experience, you can determine a great deal about a person by
what they have to say on line, and how they say it.
