Same thing happened to me.  It seemed like the patch reversed the
shift-numeric keys and alt-numeric keys.  I had what I think was the
old default mapping, with shift-1 thru shift-0 controlling my hotkey
banks, and alt-1 thru alt-8 casting spells.  When I signed on after
the patch, alt-1 to alt-10 controlled my hotkey banks, and shift-1
thru shift-8 cast spells.  I remapped them before I screwed up and got
myself killed :)

As far as configuration, I have a standard US keyboard.
