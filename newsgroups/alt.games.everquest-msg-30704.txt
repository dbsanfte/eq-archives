Me too, made a few quests in GFay.
For the most fun one i got a Dragoon Dirk, Dwarven Ringmail Tunic, Shiny
Brass Shield and a Bastard Sword in CB for the rewards.
Then killed slavers till i got a key (over 21, like the faction the slaves
give), and had a Word of something on me from a mob in FM.
Then found 2 newbies (REALLY newbies, had to help them both get down from
Kelethin), and told them i needed an escort to the Wiz spires, so i could
get into a treasure cave there. Asked 1 to hold the key for me, and another
to hold my word, told them i needed them when we reached the spire.
I lead the way and let them protect me untill we reached the wiz spired
(rather uneventful, only 1 orc attack), and got the key and word from them.
Then used /em to "use" the scroll to summon a keyhole, and use the key in
the keyhole. Then cast invis to show i went into the cave, and came back out
with the loot.
Distrubuted the loot and helped them back to Kelethin.

Hehe, thats the worst problem with making quests, need the newbies to do it.
I spend 45 min at Felwithe entrance in treeform, and around once every 30
sec i used emotes to cry and wish for someone to help me, or wish some kind
newbie would help me.
5 newbie High elves (no twinks) hunting right at the gate, and all response
i got in 45 min was 1 inspecting me, and 1 asking me for a sow.

Ended up leaving and selling the reward stuff i had to a vendor instead.
