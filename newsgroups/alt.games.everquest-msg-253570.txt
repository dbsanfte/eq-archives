I'll just say this once, just for you, lest you think this bit of
inadequate argument has any merit whatsoever.

If I wanted to have a discussion about Contract Law with someone who
doesn't have any idea what the hell he's talking about, doesn't seem
to even appreciate that he doesn't know what he's talking about, and
demonstrates no real capacity to grasp even the most basic definitions
of specific words and how they might differ from one another, I'd have
a discussion with my cousin's four year old son.

That would have the added benefit of the fact that he's nowhere near
as snotty as you, and after we're done, his mom will bring us cookies
and juice, and we'll get to take a nice nap.  You, on the other hand,
offer no such benefit in lieu of your obvious intellectual
inadequacies.

Have fun, Faned.  Don't let your smugness drown you!
