I've been away form the game for about 6 months or so.  I see there's
a pvp server.  I read about the setup and it sounds pretty good to me.
I've always played on Rallos Zek but it's nearly impossible to hold on
to your posessions.  I end up never wearing all the great gear I
worked so hard to get.  I think that's how I ended up not playing for
so long.  It got to the point where all I did was worry about lousing
my stuff, and it stopped being fun.

	ANy how I was thinking of transferring my character to Sullon.
How do you folks like it there?
