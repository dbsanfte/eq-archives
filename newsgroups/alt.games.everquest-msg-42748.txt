I don't expect people to give up their fun or groups, its still no less
annoying for those of us who can't port.  My complaint is more the fact
that when you offer 100pp for a port, you get 5 offers suddenly when you
know because your standing at the druid ring that at least two of those
offers came from someone who was just sitting at the ring.  I have no
problems offering for a port, and I generally do start offering higher
than 10 pp if i am somewhere, where i realize that they are most likely
busy etc.  However I have had people who are offering to port people
when I haven't asked demand money for a port in excess of 10 pp.  If
your selling your taxi services, not being asked to port someone, i
think it's rather greedy of people to demand 30 40 even 50 pp for a port
and i will usually tell them that's more than i will pay, i will just
walk thanks anyways.  My druid does not ever ask for a donation, will
often turn them down, etc.  I don't usually shout I am porting unless I
am planning on leaving the zone anyways, usually with a destination in
mind, but sometimes i will say i am leaving this zone, anyone need a
lift somewhere.  I have also turned down offers of donation for ports,
when busy, I do realize both sides of the issue, but you must admit
there are porters who are greedy about it.  It's not that it costs me
100 pp to get a port to or from gd that bothers me, it's that I don't
get a response until i offer 100, and then I get way too many responses,
that some of them seem greedy.
