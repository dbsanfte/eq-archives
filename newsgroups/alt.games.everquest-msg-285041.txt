It definitely wasn't a waste of money for me, but that's because
I haven't bought it yet. :-)

I did download the files, though, so when the broken Return Home
button sends my druid to Crescent Reach I'm able to arrive instead
of being stuck in limbo.  I'm mostly neutral on the Drakkin models,
but have no urge to start another character at the moment, and I
don't have characters at 70+ so I don't need the new high-level
content, and the old lower-level content is still fine for me.
