Greetings,

Last night, a Lord Protector in one of my server's first Elemental guilds (I'm to be
invited to this guild once I achieve the minimum level requirement.), was graciously
helping me beat down FG (named, Elite) in and around the GD fort, for CoV faction.

(Truthfully speaking, he was doling out the smackdown; my DPS looked quite silly compared
to his.)

Over the course of 1/2-hour, he mentioned more than once that his guild was no longer
worried about faction.

He didn't specify *which* faction, even though we were obviously gaining CoV faction with
every FG kill., so I assume he meant *all faction*.

Before we could discuss it further, he was called away on a CR in TM, and I logged because
it was late.

Can someone here provide some insight?  I thought that faction always figured into the
game, even for Elemental players.

Best regards,

Tim ==
