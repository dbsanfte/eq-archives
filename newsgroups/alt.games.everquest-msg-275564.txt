No good reason that I can think of not to make this an integrated part of
the game. As I explained in my other post, it would help building a working
economy, ultimately removing the need to nerf things all the time in an
endless battle against inflation, deflation, classes becoming useless, some
people undeservedly getting filthily rich, etc., etc. The game will never be
fun as long as they change the rules all the time.
