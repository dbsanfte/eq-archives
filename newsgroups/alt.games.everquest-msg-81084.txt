Aye, in the "time is relative thingy" a 9.8 second heal seems a helluva lot
quicker than a 10.2 second Cheal. And it will help your standing as a
miracle worker. ;)

And keep getting hit, especially when (if?) you are at full mana. People
will think you are crazy, but one day, in your mid 40's you might find you
lived thru something you shouldn't.

I want to see your Defense at least to 100, 150 preferred. :)
