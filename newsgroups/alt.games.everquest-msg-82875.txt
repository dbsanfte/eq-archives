The class may have it's boredom factor, but that's no reason to
exclude them from groups. Clerics and warriors can be boring too, yet
they are valued in groups. Blowing up 10-20 mobs at one time with an
earth shattering spell can be pretty entertaining. More entertaining
that casting CH on a tank over and over, or pressing the bash button,
imo.

Also, I play on a PvP server, where wizards get to nuke, nuke, nuke,
yawn, yawn, yawn at other players, which helps to alleviate some
boredom.
