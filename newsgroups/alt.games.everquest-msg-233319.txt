Hiya Chris,

A 'dot is short for a peridot. Clerics use them as reagents when casting
some AC (armor class) buffs. Dots sell for about 10p, 6g so it is common for
clerics to ask for 15pp to cover the cost of the dot.

Ext. KEI is Kodiac's Extended Intellect a spell that boosts Int/Wis and your
mana regeneration rate. The Ext part means that the duration of KEI has been
extended by either worn focus items or AA (Alternate Advancement) abilities
(or both.

Good luck to ya,

Mystrade Gryffonmyst
