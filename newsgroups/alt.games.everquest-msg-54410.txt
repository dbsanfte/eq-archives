You say far better to allow bards/enchanters/shaman to give the warrior
haste, again, I point out that spell (or song) based haste stacks with
item based haste.

Its not a choice of either/or.

If you have no spell based haste, item based haste makes you faster.

If you have no item based haste, spell based haste makes you faster.

If that was as far as it goes, then it would make sense to talk about
chosing between item based or spell based haste.  But its not.

If you have spell based haste on, item based haste on top of that makes
you faster than with spell based haste alone.

Faster = more aggro, more damage.  If the mob isn't running a powerful
DS, then this is all good news.

As you say, there are occaisions where it makes sense to let the secondary
tank take some of the hits.  Warrior swaps in slow two hander instead of
a pair of fast one handers and lets off on the Taunt hotkey, hybrid slaps on
a couple annoying but low cost spells to grab attention, and on you go.
If its really critical that the warrior lose aggro, he can (I know, its herasy)
turn off attack completely.  Losing aggro is rarely a problem if you have a
hybrid around, its keeping aggro while the (ranger, for example) hybrid
goes ahead and pours the damage in that's difficult.

Since (I think there are very limited exceptions) only one haste item
works at a time, you are only looking at one item's worth of AC.  I'm
not sure exactly how I'd work out the balance between losing some
AC for gaining some haste... but lets say off the top of my head that
1% haste would be worth 10AC at least.
