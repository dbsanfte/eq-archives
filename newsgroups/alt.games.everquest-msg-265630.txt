Graeme has it right.   The cleric spell Divine Intervention is used tanking
most every raid mob we do these days. The chances of that spell saving you
on death are modified by your current charisma.  Charisma gear is not an
option for this, since if you're thinking you need DI for how hard this raid
mob is, dropping a couple hundred hit points to get 30 more charisma would
be a poor choice.

Resists are more easily raised by gear.  Since charisma isn't needed by most
classes, if any stat is missing on "omfg" gear, this will be the one.
