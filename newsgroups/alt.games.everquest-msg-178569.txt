I'll see what I can do about that, maybe a giant mutated lobster will emerge
off the eastern seaboard and go on a rampage of destruction tomorrow. I
wouldn't count on it but you never really know, you just never know.





I was busy with my boyfriend all weekend.  I only have him come over for the
weekends now.  That way I look forward to seeing him.


We went snow shoeing today.  My first real outing.  It was only 5 miles but
my legs aches tonight.  They felt better last Sunday when I hiked 10 miles
on  the beach.

My boyfriend goes back home for the work week tomorrow morning.

He took me to red lobster tonight.  I almost could not eat there though
seeing the lobsters slowly dying of poor water conditions and starvation
while waiting to be boiled to death.  All of them had broken antennas proof
that they had been treated bad.

I talked to the lobsters and knew that they were very angry .  They want to
do something to get even with mankind.
