There's pretty much no way we can handle Rak right now.  We have 2 higher 
clerics ( 52 and 59 ).  We have a 60 Ranger, 55 Ranger, 53 Ranger, 53 & 54 
Pallies and a 53 Wiz.  That's about the extent of our damage output.  The 
59 Cleric is the GL and prone to LD, the 60 Ranger and 54 Pally are in 
spain, so it's hard to do a big group thing with them, except on weekends.  
In fact, I've only seen all of these people in the same place at the same 
time once.  We have a 4 50+ druids, but one is an alt of the 55 ranger, one 
is an alt of the 52 cleric, and one is on GMT.

But, now you have me thinking.  How many HPs does Rak have compared to 
Ghiosk?  If we can get both Clerics on again, and have the 60 ranger and 
one of the pallies in there with high resists ( for that nasty-ass AOE ), 
IFF the 59 Clc can keep from going LD, it may be possible for us, assuming 
we can get 2 druids online to help with healing.  Without a click-stick, 
I'd hate to find out we can't do it, though.  Might be fun...
