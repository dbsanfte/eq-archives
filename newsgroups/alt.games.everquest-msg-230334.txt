I've found the same thing, I think after reading about this idea here.

Previously, we moved forward and I'd use my eye of zomm to check side 
passages and dead end rooms for nameds, skipping if nothing was in 
there; this meant maximizing our chances of finding nameds as we saw a 
much larger portion of the dungeon by skipping past non named content 
like that.  But we had numberous fails and near fails, getting lots of 
drops early on and then drying up midway thru.

At one point we had 2 items left to collect with more than 30 minutes on 
the clock, got one item one minute -after- the 30 minutes were up, 
cleared the rest of the dungeon and only found the remaining item in one 
of the couple rooms we bypassed very early on, almost as the 
"consolation prize" timer ran out.

Since moving to a "clear everything" plan I've yet to fail a collect due 
to this sort of fluke; failed due to wiping causing immense delays, and 
even once due to just plain moving too slowly, but never wow we're going 
to win this one early.... nothing for half an hour.

Splendid
