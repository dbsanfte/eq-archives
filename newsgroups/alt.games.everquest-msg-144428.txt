Well if you enjoyed the repartee of Oasis then head on over to Lake of Ill
Omen for more of the same and then some.
If you want to distance yourself from some of the idiots try look at:-

South Karana - Aviak Village, Split Paw Spires
High Pass Keep -  Guard, warrior and Raider Rooms
Runnyeye - You'll need to BYoG
Warrens - King room and areas around
Stonebrunt Mnts - Both this and Warrens may need you to go with a group, not
sure how well they are used.
I think Paludal Caverns is good for your level on Luclin but not hunted
there.

The fast track route is LoIO, OT, Dreadlands and moving onto KC.
The trouble is these fast track routes are the reason so many 50's know
nothing of the world, by all means use them but try elsewhere as well, see
some of the world.
