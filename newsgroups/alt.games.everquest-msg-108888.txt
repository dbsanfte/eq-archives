Well, the sleeper comes when all warders in sleepers tomb are all
dead.. or something. A guild has to kill them all and the last one to
die (so they are all dead at once.. otherwise a guild can kill a
couple or something and let them respawn) spawns the sleeper, the uber
mob of EQ who can't be killed (yet at least), who then kills everyone
there and goes on a rampage in some other zones like skyshrine where
he makes a pie out of the uber dragon and his buddies there (yelinek)

Once this is done on a server, it can't happen again, the sleeper is
never seen again AND the warders never spawn again. This means that:

1) primal, some of the best weapons around due to the "avatar" buff
effect, drop a lot less in sleepers tomb

2) Any guild/groups of guilds who thinks they could actually kill the
sleeper, never gets the chance since its never on that server again.

3) A gnome illusion mask for rogues/bards only drops off one of those
warders so once the sleeper is awoken that fun item is forever gone.

From my experience, the main reasons people don't like it is:

1) that they don't get the experience/uber feeling of killing the
warders 

2) they get primal weapons coming into their guild slower, though from
my own guilds experience there post sleeper awakening on tribunal its
not that bad really.

3) bards and rogues can't ever get the gnome form item.


Verant does not get ticked off about it except that a guild exploited
there doing it using safe/non summon points or something and actually
talked about doing it in guild chat (GMS can listen in) Its not going
to get you banned to KNOW about an exploit, but it will as an
individual/group/guild to KNOW about it and then USE it while talking
about DOING it and how it is an EXPLOIT. The log of what a banned
guild actually was saying while the gm was listening was pretty funny.
I can't remember where I saw that.

The issue is that any guild uber enough to do the area KNOWS whether
they are exploiting or not.

The main prestige in awakening it is that from then on, on that
server, you are known as the guild that awakened the sleeper and
pissed everyone else off. Generally what is done is the first uber
guild to get there gets all the primal and gnome masks they reasonably
need/want then they awaken the sleeper to be "the first." Being the
first is pretty pointless except that your competition, other guilds
on your server, will spend MORE time in sleepers tomb to get fewer
primal drops. This means that it will free up OTHER rare spawn mobs
throughout the entire world for the uber guild who awoke the sleeper
to do while other people are in sleeper's tomb.
