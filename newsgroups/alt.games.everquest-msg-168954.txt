Happens to me, to.  What I do is hit Ctrl-Alt-Del, highlight "Everquest" and
then click on "Switch To".  In other words, I use Task Manager to make sure
the focus gets switched back to the Everquest application.  Works every
time.

What I suspect is happening is that during the half-second that the game is
switching from the "loading" screen to the "character select" screen, the
focus on the "Everquest" application is being lost.  It's like... if you
have a web page up, then you load another web page on top of it and then
close that web page.  Behind it you see the first web page you opened but
it's not "active" until you click on the title bar or something.

Now, I run Everquest on Windows XP, so I can do this kind of stuff.  If
you're running on Windows ME this may not work.
