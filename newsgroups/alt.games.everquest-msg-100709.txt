What I'm really wondering is how much it has costed someone who
has played since the very beginning.

Assuming they went with the "pay monthly" subscription plan and
purchased the original EQ and each expansion on the day they
were released...what would the final EQ bill come to as of today?

I'm just curious.

I'll run some admittedly fubar numbers.  Assuming $9.89 a month
for 36 months, that's $365.04.  Assuming the original EQ was
$30 and each of the three expansions was $30, that's $120.  For
simplicity we'll forget sales tax...

Any other costs?

$365.04 + $120 = $485.04.

Hmmm...I wonder how many people have more than one account and/or
have upgraded portions of their hardware...

Just thinking out loud here...just wonder what the average EQ'er
has REALLY dumped into this game (monetary-wise).
