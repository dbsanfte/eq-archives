Yeah, it started in 1995 when DirectX was introduced. Its been a long time
since then.

You're right, Glide is smaller, but it hasnt been faster in a while. And
Glide compatibilty is worse! Sure, it works great on Voodoo cards, but
anything else is outa luck. D3D at least has a chance at working with
everything, as long as the hardware manufacturer spends some time on their
drivers.
