Yup, it's really not that hard to find an arrangement everyone can
be happy with.  One night recently I was hunting mammoths for both
xp and cash, and saw someone else a couple levels below be who seemed
to be doing the same.  I wasn't sure which of us had been there first,
but Everfrost is a big enough place for two, so not a problem.  Still,
it could get awkward if both of us spotted the same mammoth and ran
for it; there could've been ill will by whoever got to it second.  So
at one point I was fighting a mammoth at the edge of the wayfarers
camp, and a second mammoth added.  As I finished the first and started
dealing with the add, I noticed he'd shown up and was watching.  So I
switched to looting the first one, and told him he was welcome to the
other.  He thanked me and took it down.  After that, I figured I didn't
have to feel at all guilty about racing him for any others. :-)

I can understand the OP getting ticked off that the lower level pair
began hunting in "his" area without even asking, but that's still not
an excuse to escalate the rudeness to the point of KSing.  The suggestion
someone else made of offering to assist them in return for the rare drop
would've been a fine compromise that would've defused the situation.
