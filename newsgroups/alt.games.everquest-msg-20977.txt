Move up to a 1HB blunt weapon, so you can hold a stat item in your
off-hand, like a Testament of Vanear (which you should get at 16 or so)
or a Charred Guardian Shield. Your epic weapon is 1HS, but you won't be
meleeing by then and while you *are* meleeing its much easier to find a
halfway decent 1HB weapon than a 1HS (since you can only use Scimitars).

Velium etched stone mace (+3 WIS), 1Kish.
Wraithbone hammer (+2 WIS), 500pp or so.
Mithril Feir'Dal Morningstar (+2 WIS), 200pp or so.

All have other stats. If you want a Mithril Feir'Dal weapon, I make them
on Morell-Thule (send Elidar a tell), on other servers good luck finding
them since very few wood-elves bother with smithing.

When you're high 20s or so, you should be looking to ditch the weapon in
favour of another stat item, like a Paw of Opolla or something.
