It drops from the Holgresh in Velious.  1200pp is reasonable.

Before spending that much money, make sure you really need the spell.
There aren't that many places you really need it.  Maybe when doing the
acument mask quest, it would be nice in Unrest, but at your level you
aren't in any real danger in Unrest if you are careful, and when
traveling in Lower Guk to the hand room to try to get a quest item there
it would be useful.  Aside from that, most places you'll encounter
undead you need to travel through will be places you'll be going with a
group, and the group will probably have someone to IVU everyone.

So, I'd recommend not buying it.  Go fight Holdgresh when that makes
sense from a non-spell-drop perspective, and pick it up then.
