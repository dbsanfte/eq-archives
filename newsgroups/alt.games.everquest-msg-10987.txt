Yes.

There are several entrances, but the easiest one to find is the one in the
northwest corner of the wall in the newbie zone.  Hug the left wall, and
you'll zone into the tunnels in West Freeport, and pop out in the West
Freeport newbie zone in the southeast corner.  Go to the northeast corner to
find the tunnels that will take you from West Freeport to North Freeport.

The shadowknight, necromancer, and rogue guilds are in the sewers in East
Freeport, so yes.
