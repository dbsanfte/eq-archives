This read differently to me on first read. Now I realize that your formula 
is just wrong. They *aren't* mathemetically equal. Example: 

delay 11, haste 15

Yours: 100 / (15 + 100) * 11 = 0.07905138339920948616600790513834
Theirs: 11 * (100 / (100 + 15)) = 9.5652173913043478260869565217391

Hrrrm.

That said, I think you were trying to convey the same thing. The order of 
operations was just a bit off, which is why it struck me funny. My bad.
