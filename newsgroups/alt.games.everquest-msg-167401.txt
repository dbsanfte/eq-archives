I just finished the Grimror bracer quest, so I'm flagged for CoD now.
There's a few people that hunt in there regularly near the zone in, and have
room in their group usually.  So I have a few questions before I do
something stupid and get us all killed.

1) Immune to changes in run speed?  Anything immune to root/snare in that
area?

2) Summoning?  If most of the stuff there summons I'll make (and probably
stay) 61 to hunt CoD and use Earthen roots (no damage, -resist check) to CC
as opposed to my old faithful Engorging Roots (191 dmg, no -resist, but
longer duration).  This would also mean I can't solo there if they do
summon. =p

3) Loot?  Anything at all good that drops off of the common mobs (looked to
be mostly foul puslings) or rare semi-nameds?  I have a set of Circled Toe
Bones that come from there, so if they drop near the zone in, I'll probably
put them on my bazaar bot so I can get another if they drop.

4) Since you're a cleric, I doubt that you'd know the answer, but are there
any animals in zone besides the DC bait rats?
