What follows are my opinons about EQ2. I will be sending in a
/feedback with the URL to SOE, but I don't claim to represent my
guild, the 7th Hammer player base or the EQ community in general. I'm
just this guy, but I think what I'm about to say has been said inside
of SOE already... what I cannot understand is why it's being ignored.

The screenshots of EQ2 are lovely. The skill / character system sounds
great. I've heard wonderful things about the game. Don't do it,
please.

I understand that many people have spent uncountable hours producing
EQ2. I understand that it represents a new wave of retail sales. I
understand that the EQ codebase is aging, and you want to move on.
Still, I beg of you: don't do this, and if you think about it, you'll
realize that those sales would be the one golden egg you would be left
with after killing this very profitable goose.

EverQuest has survived through the release of many seemingly
unstoppable games including SOE's highly touted release of SWG, the
TSR-based, and player-extensible NWN, and the very, very popular DAOC.
It won't survive EQ2, and neither will EQ2.

Why? Several reasons, but let's start with: Because WoW has generated
so much excitement that it's going to pull away as much as 1/4-1/2 of
the player base. That leaves a very depleted player base in EQ...
that's ok, we've seen that before, and we'll see it again. If EQ
continues to grow and develop, it will pull those players back over
time.

However, if you then further split the player base by releasing EQ2,
several things will happen:

* EQ2 will snowball into an EQ-sized game because of player-base size
* EQ will shrink past the the ability to attract players back from WoW
* Guilds and other community infrastructure will fall apart in EQ
* New players will join EQ2, find limited community and leave, never
seeing EQ

A year ago, EQ2 might not have killed EQ, but it still would have been
a bad idea. That's because EverQuest is not a video game, but an
ongoing community and personal storyline. It doesn't work the way Pac
Man does where players can just drop the game and pick up a new,
improved version with little or no transition pain. EQ's code base
might be aging, but being a software engineer I know that it's
possible (not desirable, but possible) to slowly upgrade that code
base in-place. Not in the rushed way that DX9 upgrades happened, but
in the gradual way that warrior changes were phased in. The Bazaar
could be SWG-ified. The old-world zones could be given instanced
encounters as sub-zones. The skill system could be enhanced. The
AA/AP/XP/LA systems could be unified more cleanly, all without
throwing away the existing code (or at least not all at once).

I started with EQ just afer Velious came out, and I'll stop just after
EQ becomes unplayable due to lack of subscriber-base. At that time,
I'll just switch to climing mountains for fun, and say a permanent and
fond goodbye to my online friends. How many others like me are there?
How many others who will go to WoW because you're "pushing them out"?
How many who will go to CoH, NWN or some other non-MMOG?

Please halt the release of EQ2. Re-consider the future of EQ and make
retaining players your #1 priority. Thank you.
