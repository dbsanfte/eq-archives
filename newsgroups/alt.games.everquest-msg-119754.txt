Cute logfile, but I suggest that anyone who wants to know what really
happened also take a look at:
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000196.html
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000210.html
as well.

GMs *can* join guilds temporarily. They often do it when they copy a
character to fix some of the subtler bugs, like faction resets. But,
clearly it was the impression of the members of Conquest during that
discussion that there were no GMs in channel.

My impression is that Brad pulled the guildchat logs after the ruling
was made to point out specific quotes that demonstrated that Conquest
members were fully aware that they were using exploits to beat the
third and fourth warder.
