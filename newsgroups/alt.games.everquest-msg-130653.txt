}> question:  I've heard Vellious is really only for higher levels.

Personally, I think Velious is worth getting.  Yes, it is more for high 
levels.  There are a couple places where you can conceivably group at 
26ish there, notably leopards in IC, Crystal Caverns, possibly Eastern 
Wastes, and possibly the giant fort in GD.  All of those would probably 
require a group that was on average a couple levels higher than you, but 
it's doable.  

But more importantly, there are quests to investigate, tradeskills to do, 
NPCs to talk to, places to explore, and more places with more people to 
hang out.  For example, you can easily do the first two coldain shawl 
quests without actually fighting anything, just /aucing for giant toes and 
heads in GD.  And I've frequently found thurgadin a very nice place to 
just hang out and soak up the atmosphere.

On top of all that, it only costs about $20 from the Sony online store.  
And that way it'll already be there if and when you need it.

}Not a zone, but a suggestion:
}A month or so ago pets got a lot of changes, including that they >can't
}break mez anymore<.
}This is significant in that you can have a pet up while in a group and still
}mezzing things. Just get hit once so your pet engages then step back and
}wait for the mob to die :).

People keep saying this, and in my opinion it kinda misses the ball.  Pets 
breaking mez was never a -huge- problem, and was frequently useful.  Tank 
pulls 4, AoE mez on inc, tank breaks a mez, and the one that resisted 
makes a beeline for you, whereupon the pet conveniently tank mezzes and 
you tell the warrior to take that one next.

Soloing, I always found it very handy that I could line up 4-5 mezzed 
light blues and the pet would autoatically switch to the next one when it 
was done with the one it was on.  Now, I just have to use root more. :)

However, that patch -was- a significant blessing to pet casters, and 
chanters particularly for one very simple reason.  Pets still go on 
walkabout, but -now- they don't bring back an army of friends they made on 
their trip.  No longer with the "Hey, where'd my pet go?" "Taunting 
Attacker, Master."  -That- is what made them a real problem, whether 
grouping or soloing.

They can still be a problem if you're level pulling mobs that spawn 
relatively nearby and the pet's lower level is enough to aggro them.  But 
we can't have everything, can we?

And then there was a bug where some things that wre indifferent to me were 
KoS to my aggroed pet.  I remember particularly a mature rockhopper in 
mons letalis that joined in when my pet was fighting stonegrabbers.  If my 
pet wasn't aggroed, they'd walk right over us midfight wihout aggroing.  I 
hope they've fixed that. :)
