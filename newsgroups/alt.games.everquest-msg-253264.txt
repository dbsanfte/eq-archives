The library in Plane of Knowledge, the floor below the entrance, there is a
big barbarian in platemail at the back.  He sells the skill books which
teach people disciplines.

Warriors get several versions of a taunt / aggro increaser at various
levels.   Something like level 25, 40, 56, 63.    Something, bellow,
berate... incite is the level 63 version.

You buy the skill book from the barbarian, and hand it to your warrior
guildmaster, who then teaches you the skill.  Select it in the combat
abilities window, and hit make hotkey, and you're good to go.  It uses
endurance each time you use it, but it's nowhere near a significant amount
of your endurance bar.
