What kind of video card are you using?  Is it on the supported video card list
at everquestlive.com ?

I've got an old S3 that won't display names or spells unless they are in front
of a dark background.  Sounds similar to your situation.

It is very unlikely they will fix it since the card is not supported, based on
the official replies on their tech board.  Same may apply to your situation as
well.
