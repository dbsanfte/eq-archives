I would imagine, that unlike us speculating here in the newsgroup, VI has
done some market studies and figured out that they will increast their
profits by raising the price.  This means that they have a fair idea how
many people will quit due to the price hike, and know that it will likely be
more than offset by the increased revenue from those that don't quit.
Remember, they are a business, their goal is to make money.
