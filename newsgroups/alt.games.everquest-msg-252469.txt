You bought a shirt that you weren't allowed to take out of the store.  You
found out it had a hole in it.  You went back to the store and took the
money you paid out of the register while nobody was looking.

Not anybody's fault you were stupid enough to buy a shirt you couldn't take
out of the store but your own, but you knew that going in.  Still doesn't
excuse the fact that you stole the money back.  =P
