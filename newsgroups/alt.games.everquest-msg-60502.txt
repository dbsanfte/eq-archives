Yup.  Some people disagree, but that's because they are confused over
what a tank does.  The tank's job is to be the person the mob is
beating on, so that the monks and rogues and rangers and pets and
wizards can be dealing damage.  Warriors do have good damage output,
but that's not related to tanking, except that doing damage helps keep
aggro.  Warriors are the best tanks because of high HP and high AC,
taunt, and their disciplines.

Yup.  They aren't tanks.  They are damage dealers and pullers.  There
may be some situations in which someone else is better for pulling,
but for most situations, especially at the high end, no one comes near
a good monk.

Besides pulling, FD allows a monk to survive a wipeout, and tell the
party when it is safe for the camped clerics to come back and start
rezing.  Monks: don't leave Freeport without one.

Depends on equipment.  Warriors have a *lot* of hitpoints.  A
well-equiped warrior only needs to be at half HP at the *start* of a
fight when soloing, and you can bandage up to half.  Furthermore,
there's a weapon from ToFS that procs summoning bandages (summons a
stack of L/2, where L is your level, up to a max of 20 bandages, and
the proc is pretty frequent, so all you have to do is equip the thing,
and go whack a green for a short while, and you've got plenty of
bandages).

Yup.  Before they got evade, they couldn't use backstab, because
they'd get aggro and die.

They have a spell they can use in combat that lowers them on the hate
list (kind of like a rogue's "evade" skill).  Before that spell,
rangers were hampered much the same way rogues were.

Starting around level 20, they are one of the best solo classes.  Find
an animal, snare it, panic it, and beat the crap out of it as it
crawls away.  There are enough animals in EQ to make this work at
pretty much all levels, once rangers get their panic animal spell.

They've also got the best tracking in the game.  They have a much
larger range than druids or bards, and they get to sort and filter the
tracking list.  They can sort by distance, reverse distance, spawn
time, con, or reverse con, and they can filter out by con.  Many
people don't realize just how many mobs there are in EQ, and a lot of
great hunting spots go totally unused.  A typical outdoor zone usually
has 200-400 mobs in it.  Zones like EK or FM can easily handle 10
times as many players as they usually get, but everyone tries to crowd
into a few known spots.  A party with a ranger to find the mobs that
other people are not bothering with should be able to pull almost
continously in many many zones that are vastly underutilized now.

They have good AC, too, and pretty good HP.  Clerics are designed to
be able to take a beating...not as well as a tank, of course, but
better than the other healing classes.  This is one of the things that
distinguishes a primary healing class from a secondary healing
class...secondary healers can often heal pretty well, but if they piss
a mob off by doing it, they have a problem.  A cleric can stand there
and take the beating while the tanks and crowd controllers get things
back under control...or they can channel a root or stun and deal with
the problem themselves.

Before Kunark, when you were putting together an XP group, the shaman
put the cleric out of business.  Sure, the cleric could heal
better...but they shaman made it so that the group didn't need it.
Attack speed debuffs are very powerful, and reduce the damage taken by
the group enough to allow the shaman's weaker healing to be enough.
Clerics were like wizards...you needed them in your big encounters,
but your routine "grind out the XP" group didn't need them.

Kunark added tough mobs, and brought the cleric back to life, and the
wizard, too.



>their abilties also mature quite late. Fortunately buffs,

But when they mature, they are spectacular.  I think shaman are the
only class to solo a real dragon (i.e., not a drake or something like
that).

In the 50's, wizards get spells that have very low resist rates.  At
52, I've hit level 65 mobs for full damage.  For more ordinary
encounters, our advantage over the other nuking classes is that we get
nukes that check against magic, fire, and cold.  Mobs that a magician
or druid finds are resisting 100% will often be somewhat, or even
fully, susceptable to another line of magic, letting a wizard hit them
with out ordinary spells.

Right...we have to conserve our mana.  Throw a nuke or two per fight,
and sit back down.  We make a noticable difference, but not a
memorable one, in routine groups.  We can do a pretty good amount of
damage fast, at the cost of 10 minutes downtime, so when a situation
arises where the party needs to finish off the mob fast, a couple
wizards standing up and dumping everything they have on the mob helps
a lot.

Soloing a wizard is fine, and comparable to a necro or non-quad kiting
druid.  Yes, we end up sitting on our ass for 7-10 minutes after the
fight, but the fight was very short.  Those classes that solo with
little or no downtime take a lot longer to kill their mobs.  The
overall XP rate is about the same.

A kiting wizard is quite a sight to behold.  I've got a nuke that does
about 650 damage with a 3 second casting time.  Add in recovery time,
and I can cast it about every 6 seconds.  That's fast enough, and my
snare slows the mob enough, that I can kite things in remarkably small
areas.

Actually, some groups purposefully pull several, and AoE them.  Most
fun I had in a dungeon was in a group doing that in LGuk.  Pull 7 or
8, and then me and the cleric and the bard would AoE damage them,
which the enchanter AoE stunned them to keep them in place.  Worked
pretty well, until we told the puller "bring a few more next time" and
he brought 25, starting with the Ghoul Lord and working down. :-)

That was the first AoE group try for all of us.  People who make a
habit of it do a lot better.
