Just because no one has heard an explanation doesn't mean one can't/doesn't
exist.  You don't get told the reasons behind everything in the real world
and there is no reason you should in Norrath.  The spells are available to
learn from your guild and they are not saying where they got them.  Probably
from that wizard guy that discovered Luclin, but not necessarily.  Perhaps
they got them through dealings with one of the dark gods, or perhaps from
one of the un-named.

I just read the spells are available from Rivervale and Neriak.  Those two
are arch enemies historically.  Could that hint at an untold storyline?
