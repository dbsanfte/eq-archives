Agreed.

I interpreted a greater speed increase than others seemed to, based on
the same information released. We're all pissing in the wind until those
speeds are documented facts.

What I was doing was defending my initial position that I felt horses at
9-15k were underpriced based upon thier speed. 3 ranges of speed and
globally adjusting mob speeds to compensate hinted to me of greater than
SoW speeds being commonly available
