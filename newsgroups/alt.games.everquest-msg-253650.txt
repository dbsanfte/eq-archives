 no one will hail a planar projection early. Some will

If someone leaves the raid to hail the projection they are in for one hell
of a surprise. you have to be IN the raid to get the flag, otherwise he wont
respond to you.

as a raidleader if I saw someone disband the raid and hail projection, not
only would they not be getting an invite back to raid to get the flag, they
wouldnt ever be invited to any more of my raids.



and.. as far as your ideas.. moderating raid chat sounds like a good idea,
moderating anything else is bad.

I dont know what kinda luck you've had on raids but even on the open raids I
attend I havnt seen anyone hail the projection before it was time. thats the
single fastest way to make sure thats the only flag you ever get.
