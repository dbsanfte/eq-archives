Has anyone seen what kind of things they are considering?

The original quote makes me think of weapon styles, similar to those
in Dark Age of Camelot.

(Simplified) 

Each weapon type has its own set of styles (so in EQ terms, 1HS, 1HB
etc would have different styles), which do varying amounts of damage
and give bonuses or penalties to the next attack for things like
defense or attack rating etc.

Certain styles only work in certain circumstances (after a parry, say)
or from certain positions (side, back, front)

And some styles follow on from preceding styles, and are only
available upon successful completion of the preceding one.

Some style progressions are only available to certain classes (the
"Assassin" classes get a set of styles based on critical
strikes/backstabs)

And different weapon types have varying effects on different monster
types (or armour types), so for example, when you see a skeleton, put
away that piercing weapon, and pull out the big hammer.
