I think where and how you fight is gonna make the difference between
which logic applies.  If you are fighting in fully controlled areas
where you pull as you are ready the buffs may not make enough of a
difference for you to care.  On the other hand if  you are doing
something like a one group, no enchanter or bard, raid of the Hole you
might find any extra scrap of mana efficiency you can create is the
difference between moving forward or porting out to Tox to start over
again.  Don't have neato calculations like Dan's to back this up, but as
a cleric for a group that does just such runs for sport its been my
experience that its not the single given battle you need to consider,
