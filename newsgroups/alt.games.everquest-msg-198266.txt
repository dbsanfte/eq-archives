If you want FT forget the forest loop and go for a earing of the solstice
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12456

I didnt notice you mention your class but at a guess your a hybrid of some
kind (Sk or pally maybe) so this earing will be perfect for you having both
excellent melee and caster stats.
I recently got one for my Beastlord and it set him back around 4.2 k buying
everything from the bazaar (I had it broke down by item but I seem to have
lost that list)

Its a easy no risk quest with a fantastic reward, what more could you ask
for ?
