No, it won't.  The pet won't aggro it by itself.

That was changed so pets wouldn't cause trains by themselves.
Now a pet will only get aggro if something attacks you or if
it's fighting a mob which paths by another mob when the two
mobs are social.

But you should be able to sit by the spawn point and gain
aggro fairly quickly.  There's a delay between spawn and the
mob checking for aggro, however, which would still allow
another player time to successfully attack before it would
attack you.
