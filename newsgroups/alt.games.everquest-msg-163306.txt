I had just worked on this myself.  I had been told to kill roaming skellies
and zombies.  But it seemed two ghasts would spawn during the evening hours
whether I did this or not (usually found them between 3 and 6 a.m. EQ time).
I would run back and forth killing ghasts and mobs at the obelisk.  Then I
had read somewhere that the necro is triggered when turning in the hearts.
When I got my final heart, I bound myself in LF and turned them in.  I gated
back to LF (it was about 1 a.m.) and lo and behold the necro was on track.
