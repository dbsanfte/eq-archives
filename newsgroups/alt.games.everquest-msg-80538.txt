Yes and no. What you say is correct, characters should (according to Verant)
stay in-game for 30 seconds, before being dropped. However since Luclin came
out the time has varied enormously, my worst case has been 20 minutes AFTER
a reboot. So the actual "active character" bit is intended functionality,
but the recent spate of complaints about abnormal delays suggest a bug.

I think a lot my problems are related to using a software gateway to connect
several PCs to EQ at once. I think that because these gateways use IP-faking
(can't remember the term, you know what I mean) EQ isn't recognising I have
gone.

But I am sure not everyone uses multiple PCs, so it is likely that there is
a bug in the disconnect code, or a bug in the timer.
