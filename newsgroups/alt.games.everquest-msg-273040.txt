I'd think if the Supreme Court decides it isn't legal, that means it
was, in fact, not legal.  Why would it be legal until the SC ruled
otherwise?  Or was there some earlier SC ruling that said the
government could lock someone up without charges or access to counsel
or the Courts, that the SC now overturned?  Or did they rule that the
government had done nothing illegal, but would be violating the law if
they didn't charge Hamdi with a crime and give him access to the legal
system after the ruling?
