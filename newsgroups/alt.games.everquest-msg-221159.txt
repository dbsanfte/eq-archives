Thought I'd share this one, as it happened to my brother, and I can
verify the going on.

Anyways, brother is in a Mistmoore LDoN run, doing a colletion
mission, when shortly into the mission the Wizard starts whining about
needing to get something to eat.  

This continues for most of the run, until nearing 30 min left, he says
that he's leaving, can he get his split?? The group leader tells him ,
no, that he's basically screwing them of any chance to complete the
mission so, if he can't  wait for 30 min to grab a fricking sandwich,
he forfeits his share.   (On top of this, he couldn't just run to the
kitchen for a snack, it had to be a sub from U.S. Subs.  Wtf???)

Anyways, so upon being told for the 3rd time that he'd forfeit his
share, he evac's the group to North Karanas.

(Which is when I got the tell from my brother and went up to check on
the events myself).

Anyhoo, the group had a Druid also, so got back to G Fay and managed
to keep going on the adventure, but the delay defintely screwed them
out of any chance of success. I guess the moral of the story is to
disband and assholes in your group before they get a chance to screw
you royally.

And BTW, Tomadar, L40 wizard on The Rathe, you're definetly  on the
"never come close to grouping with again" list.
