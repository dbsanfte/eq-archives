You are mistaken.  Yes, they have promised that the effort
will not change:

    We don't plan on releasing detailed mechanics - Some
    things people should really discover for themselves
    as part of normal gameplay. The goal was to smooth
    the path from 30 to 50, not to make it require less
    overall gameplay, or happen faster. The intent wasn't
    to get people from 30 to 50 any faster. 

    The overall path isn't any easier to reach level
    50 -- a retroactive experience boost wouldn't really
    be called for. Down the line of what I said at the last
    fan faire, "If we did something with hell levels, we
    would have to find a fair solution that didn't affect
    anyone's existing experience or progress."

    We found that solution.
