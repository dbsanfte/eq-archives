Interesting and yet another example of how the EQ design team is open to
imitating other systems in order to remain competitive in a crowding market.
This is not a knock, I respect them for being open to enhancing the game by
incorporating some of the best ideas from other systems:

- LDoN's adventure system builds on the concept introduced in Anarchy Online
of mission-based private, group-only dungeons.
- This week's announced melee changes look very much like DAoC's combat
styles
- This Group and Raid Leadership experience notion is reminiscent of Star
Wars Galaxies's system of prodiving different types of experience that can
be applied to different types of advancement.
- The group waypoint concept was one of those minor but compelling little
features of SWG.

Kudos to the design team!
