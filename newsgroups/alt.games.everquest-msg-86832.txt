It doesn't matter what race you are there are other races that don't like
you. You may not be KOS but you will have to improve faction for the
trainers to like you to the point of being willing to train you. Most cities
have a simple quest which you can buy faction of some sort. With this
purchased faction you should be able to do quests to improve the faction you
need.
