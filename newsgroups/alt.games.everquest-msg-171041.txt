You may want to amend that part a bit to reflect current times rather
than 1999.  Bone chips rarely sell anymore it seems, but if you could
get a plat for a stack, I guess that's ok. Silk (both regular and ling)
is going for anywhere from 2 to 5 plat *each* (not per stack... per
silk) and upwards. If you want to move pelts, even the HQ bear doesn't
seem to go for much anymore, and you can only rarely find an aspiring
tailor who wants HQ Cat. Best to get a skinning knife and cut them all
down to stacks of LQ pelts which people use to make leather padding for
smithing skillups. Or, collect ling silk and make the paddings yourself
and sell them.

Ruined pelts.... yeah. Vendor trash unless you are doing tailoring and
haven't trivialed tattered armor yet.
