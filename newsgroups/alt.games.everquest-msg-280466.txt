/shrug 

I'd have never found the qeynos book in a million years; I started 
countless toons in qeynos pre-Kunark, and I don't think I EVER went 
around back in that corner of the zone... and the freeport book isn't 
exactly in plain sight either. Granted they are *EASY* to get to... but 
that presumes you know where they are and what they are.

A true newbie of the sort who wouldn't know what the feerott is, or that 
there is a book in there wouldn't have any better odds of bumping into 
several of the other books either.

Idiocy isn't the issue. Zone times and distance are.

I'd have to traverse most of 4 complex and dense zones, crossing 3 zone 
lines to reach the PoK book from the SK guild in Neriak. Rathe to 
Feerott is just one simple nearly straight run, with only one zone line.

For me the complexity and density wouldn't be real issues - I know 
neriak. But the 3 zone times would kill me. For a true newbie... I'd bet 
I could Run from the gaurd tower in North K to Qeynos Hills before they 
could get to PoK from the neriak SK or Rogues guild.
