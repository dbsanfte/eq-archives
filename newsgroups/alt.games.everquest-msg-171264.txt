>What's the best way to move EQ to the new system?

Fastest:

open up current system, remove hard drive.
Open up new system. Remove ide cable
from where it attaches to cdrom drive.

Put the hard drive from your old system on top of your
case, or in a slot above or below that cdrom drive. plug
in that removed ide cable and a power supply thing.

(of course the above should be done only with the computers off)

Reboot new computer. You now have 2 hds showing.

Copy over your ENTIRE eq dir and whatever other stuff you
have on your current hard drive you want on the new one. 

Shut down.

remove the old hard drive hooking cdrom ide cable back up 
to cd rom drive.

Reboot.

Might sound like a lot but its far faster than fully reinstalling it.
Slower ways would be to burn the entire DIR to some cdroms, etc.
