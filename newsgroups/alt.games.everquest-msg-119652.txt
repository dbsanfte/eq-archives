I recently hit LvL 47 and I would Really like to check out the Planes (even
just to pop in to check it out).  I am a Wooldelf Druid that Worships
Tunare, and my question is Would I be able to to roam around in the Plane Of
Growth (After all it is Tunares Plane right?) without getting arrgoed or
would I get Killed in no time.
