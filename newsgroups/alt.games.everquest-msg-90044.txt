The ranger heals are a joke.  At level 13, my ranger has a 9 point heal.  Do
you have any idea how many times I have to cast that to give me just half my
hp back?  That being said, once you hit level 22, rangers are great soloers,
on animals.  Up to level 22, well, most classes can solo that far, rangers
included.
