 Yeah but I hear at 61+ a lot of mobs turn green. Apparently Verant
narrowed the XP range on mobs when you get above 60. Upper Sebilis is
green. Velks is green. I'm guessing a lot of zones people are presently
in will be green. I wonder where Verant expects all those people to go
to level now. There's not that many single-group-friendly zones with
mobs 55+.
