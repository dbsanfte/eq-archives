Simple........ you were banned.  Following an extensive investigation by lead
GMs across all the servers, it was discovered that almost *everyone* in
Norrath had been exploiting the geography and design by sometimes running to
zone lines when being attacked by a mob and doing poorly in the battle and
facing possible death. Since, as you all doubtless knew, the mobs are unable
to cross zone lines, this was clearly an unfair advantage, and constituted
use of the world geography and design as a planned explot. Consequently,
everyone in the game was banned except for 27 people spread across nine
servers who had just logged on for the first time yesterday evening and were,
as yet, unaware there were other zones to travel to.  They were let off with
a warning in their reconds. And the server populations were only just
starting to recover after the mass banning for the food stacking exploit.
*sigh*.
Good luck in Shadowbane!
