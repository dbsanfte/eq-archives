As long as you keep a summoning mob rooted, a pet tanking will always
work, the amount of agro is irrelevant. Not sure how well that works
for a druid since you have to worry about charm breaking but with my
shaman I can always hit spirit call, root the mob and back out for a
breather while the summoned puppies tank. I'll get summoned instantly
if root breaks but never otherwise.
