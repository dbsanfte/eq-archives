Apparently there's some sort of bug in there now where "odd characters"
are showing up all over the screen for various people. Verant (at least
the online guides) are aware of it on at least two servers. Don't be
shocked if we're going into emergency patch mode shortly.

Was going on a Vox raid in a little while. Rethinking that now. Her lair
is not the best place to be when you suddenly hear,
"SYSTEM WIDE MESSAGE: THE WORLD IS COMING DOWN! LOG OUT NOW!"
"SYSTEM WIDE MESSAGE: THE WORLD IS COMING DOWN! LOG OUT NOW!"
"SYSTEM WIDE MESSAGE: THE WORLD IS COMING DOWN! LOG OUT NOW!"

Ooops. Guess we'll get all those corpses later when the server's back up
and everything in here has respawned already.
