Your kidding about the clerics VS Shamans in healing right ?

A level 30 somthing Cleric is going to be able to heal more at once, and do
it without generating NEAR the aggro that a Shaman would.

Sub 40's a shaman has Greater Healing, a 300 hp heal, healing a 100 hp heal,
that are both fairly high taunt spells all things considered. A sub 40's
Cleric already has 2 of his Celestial Line of spells ( remedy, and health )
that are almost 0 tuant, has a BETTER Greater Healing ( 15 pts of health is
15 pts of health after all ), and gets Superior healing at 34. While
Superior is a fairly large taunt at least its available for a heal the tank
for a lot RIGHT NOW option.

No, clerics pull ahead of the other wisdom casters, and never look back
starting at level 14, and REALLY pull ahead at level 19 when they get thier
first HoT.
