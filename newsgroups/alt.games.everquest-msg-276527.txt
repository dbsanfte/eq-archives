Hi all!

I was wondering if anyone had participated in any fun guild events apart
from raiding.
In EQ1 we had an all day LDoN adventure till you drop session, but obviously
we can't do that in EQ2.

We're looking at different things like scavenger hunts and find person x,
but thought there would have to be some fun experiences people here had.



thanks =)
