A bit late for clerics to be flipping out. There's very few boss fights
in GoD where clerics use ch. The only place I use ch nowadays is in exp
groups and if I had to use the higher cost spells we'd be back to med
breaks, which no one would like. GoD mobs mitigate slows to the point
where most of our pre-GoD guild shaman have retired. Typical of SoE to
totally destroy shaman's ability to heal in groups by lowering dps on
mobs without actually improving their ability to heal to compensate.
