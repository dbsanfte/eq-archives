Maybe

Yet he approves of this, dispite the fact that the vision purposefully
moved attack from x to a in beta 3 dispite all the testers pointing out
loudly that this would cause lots of accidental attacks on NPC's. More
dumbing down the game, IMO. :-}

When beta 4 started, the guild note had the wrong first name on it for
the paladin guild leader in Freeport. I ended up making the first friend
I had in the game stumbling around the Temple of Marr trying to find who
to hand the note to. Eventually we decided that the NPC with the same
last name as the one on our notes was the only reasonable choice and
were able to go out to the west freeport newbie grounds and begin our
bat and orc pawn killing careers.

Now they need to organise the new UI windows in a semi sensible fashion
so they don't cover most of the newbie's screen in a confusing array.

Now the slackers in raiding guilds won't reveal themselves to anyone
monitoring the guild count channel when they log in their alts to wait
until the raid reaches the money part to log in and forget to unjoin the
channel.
