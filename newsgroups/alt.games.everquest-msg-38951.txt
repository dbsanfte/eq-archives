On the title question:  my 17 (now 18) SK found grouping the kobolds near 
the zone to be very good exp.  Entire zone was green to my 44 enc, except 
for some of the named kejekans in town (blue).  However, elder 
granitebacks and highland tigresses would still aggro, and on my way out, 
I killed a highland tiger and was suprised to actually get exp. :)

Has anyone done the quest in town that involves the crystallized shadow 
stuff from ToFS?  Was it worth it?

How about the Paineel quest for the Titans stuff?

}You can't get faction to deal with them, ever.
}They don't offer quests because you have bad faction to start and
}there are no kills which raise their faction = SOL.

Anyone tried wolf form?  It changed my faction from indifferent to 
indifferent.  Ie, it may have reset to indiff, but already being there, I 
couldn't tell.

}My dark elf cleric of inny is glower dubious and has same problem. My
}31 troll sk of cazic is scowl to them so she said "well screw you
}too!" and started killing allt he blue kejekens who run around to the
}south east of the zone by a rock wall where there is a constant parade
}of them and granitebacks and such. Really a great place for a 31 sk to
}solo on blues.

Hehe, my 17 DE SK got pretty good exp off an even-con kejekan fisherman... 
He hit me first!  The blighter...

}Odd my troll sk sure seems like she has killed a ton of kobolds but is
}still threaten to paineel faction.. bleah = /

Gotten my SK up to dubious.  It takes two tons.  However, I think you have 
to be amiable to get the guard to give you the key.  This took my 
enchanter an extra 6 tons.  You can still enter the city at dubious if 
someone else has the key, but it will scare the pants off you when they go 
LD and you realize you need the key to get out, if you aren't bound 
nearby...  My guild's necro was seriously sweating when I logged back in. 
:)  He could train at indifferent, though.  I _told_ the fool staying 
bound in iceclad wasn't such a hot idea... after all the lectures 
he's given me for not binding nearby, sheesh! :)

And various necros in the city still con dubious... anyone know anything 
about how to raise the _other_ heretics faction without horking another 
faction too badly?
