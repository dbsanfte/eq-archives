I have never advocated telling a child that they are "not old enough".  Each
and every response I have given has said that a child's questions should
always be answered at a level they can understand.  At no point have I, or
will I ever, advocate telling a child "you are not old enough".

I'm begining to wonder if its your abilites to understand that have you
hesitant to talk to a child and not the child's.
