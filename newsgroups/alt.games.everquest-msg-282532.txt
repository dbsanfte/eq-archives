Wow, as I was reading Jaorr's post, I felt like I was reading
something I'd written about myself!  Well, except my characters
are levels 58 and 54 instead of 70 and 63, and I haven't even
bought DoD yet.  But I feel the same way you do about how little
I've gotten from the last few expansions.

I do see Faned's point, but I get the feeling I'm behind the curve,
and until I further along I won't find these expansions useful.
My 58 monk (probably a little lower at the time) tried teaming up
with a 65 chanter and a two-boxed 50's cleric to try the first tier
of DoN, and we found the little tasks too hard.  (Spiders we could
handle, but drakes were a pain.)  My 54 druid got escorted into
Stillmoon once.  But that's about all I've been able to see in DoN.
My conclusion was that I still need to level up in OoW zones for a
while, which is okay, but it doesn't give me a lot of reason to buy
DoD (so I haven't) or this next expansion, because apparently I'm
not ready to use most of that content.

So sure, these new expansions may be great for the casual player
because they present a path by which casual groups can progress to
better gear.  But until I reach that part of the path, there's
nothing there for me.

DoD actually does try to do something about this by offering the
monster missions, which I understand can be done by any mix of
levels.  (Though I have no idea how the loot scales.)  It's just
that that concept doesn't interest me.  I have my own characters
I like to play; I don't want to be a fairy ranger instead, or an
avatar of Cazic-Thule, or whatever.

I think that's just another curve that I'm not as far along on.
Many players have played lots of alts and may have been looking
for something fresh in terms of characters to play.  Me, I've
only been playing for two years, and as a casual (but steady)
player, so I'm still happy to play my first few characters and
watch them grow, learn how to play them well, etc.  But the new
expansions aren't giving me much I can use yet.

There *have* been some relatively recent additions that I applaud,
such as the instanced missions in Qeynos, Befallen, and Unrest.
They're a shade challenging for a group of only three; if they'd
scale for number of players instead of just level, they'd be perfect.
