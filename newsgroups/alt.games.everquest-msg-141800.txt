That was exactly my reasoning behind not caring about RGC.

Yeah, but most of those spells are impossible to sell, the only druid spells
that sell well pre-56 are the level 50 fixed duration self-only invis
(velious), the level 51 component free asshat spells (luclin), SoE (luclin),
Foliage Shield (luclin) and Nature Walkers Behest (velious), any other druid
spells in that level range that are drop only are common enough that there's
nearly no demand for it.

The only druid spells I've seen (speaking only from the top floor,
non-crypt) drop in sebilis have been Circles of Winter/Summer, Spirit of
Scale and technically Upheaval, since the cleric version that drops there
used to be scribable by druids, now we have to do the lottery quest in FV
for the druid version of Upheaval.
