WOOTAGE!

Been waiting for this one. First chat channels for raids, now this. I'm
guessing there will be a default channel for this, sort of /rd instead
of /g for groups?

Sounds like you can invite a group leader and his group will become part
of the raid.

Question is, will the xp be split among the raid? Will everyone on the
raid be able to see what's looted, not just the members of the xp party?
This could clear up a lot of ninja issues.

Sweet.
