Keep in mind that you're an oldbie, and I was specifically talking
about newbies.

: it only takes about three days 
: played to reach level 40 as a melee.

A level every 1.8 hours?!  Wow.  (I don't doubt you, I'm just
impressed!  I, myself, never got past level 30, but I rerolled
several times on the FV server.  Later, I regretted my server
choice.  All that work on my characters was lost every time I
decided to reroll.  I wish there was an RP server like FV that
allowed multiple characters.)

: You may be right but I suspect that, 
: if, (they were not deserte4d when I was playing my twink.) the newbie zones 
: are seserted it's due to faster leveling.  

My experience is probably biased since I played mostly on the
low population FV server.  However, I still think they could
have handled "fast & easy travel" much, much better...

I *still* remember the travel I was "forced" to do as a newbie,
and I remember it VERY fondly.  Sure, later, it became somewhat
of a nuisance, but I'm sure extremely happy I had to travel "the
hard way" at first.  It made me respect the breadth of the world
quite a bit.  Now, I suspect, newbies and oldbies alike just
"click on the book" to zoom across the world, the planes, the
moon...  Very sad for the true newbies.

: Hell, HHK picklclaws camps are crowded these days.
