Interesting list, wish they'd added something for the 65 crowd. Given
the level of mobs in Nadox and HF, I doubt even a major exp boost
would help out there at our lvl. On the bright side, it's an excuse to
visit HF again, I always thought it was one of the best designed zones
for 'crawling' even if the exp was abysmal.
