Tim, I thank you most heartily for your post. I've gotten quite an education
(which is a good thing!) about this subject. As I've said before, I know
that this NG doesn't say "alt.english.everquest", which would certainly
imply that the NG was in english and _no_ other language (but of course, we
all know that non English posts are few and far between here). Am I missing
a point here? Do the vast majority of english speaking NG's print a FAQ out
for other non english speaking peoples, telling them that they can certainly
post but that their post might not be answered, generally speaking, because
the NG speaks primarily English and can't typically understand even the
*subject* of the post, much less know how to answer it? I'm not downing
people who _don't_ speak English, trust me... (as I said, I really wish I
had the wisdom and the wit to learn many more languages, and that is also
not meant in any way as a put down for the English speaking among us who
also are able to speak *other* languages as well) but I just still wonder
(I'm sorry, I still can't help it), why DO they post to a non-alternate
language NG (and one which is, as I said before). I'm not trying to say that
the entire world should bow down before us because we speak English, I am
only wondering (well and truly, I promise you!) WHY do people do this? If I
post (and I do, a LOT), I generally post because I want an answer to a
question. I can generally *expect* that answer, because most of this NG DOES
speak and write more or less coherent English, and they understand what I am
asking, most of the time (and when they don't, it's generally MY fault for
not being clear enough) But what if someone were to post in an obscure
language that very few, if any, people, might understand? What would we do?
Would we ask that person in our English lamguage to re-post because no one
could understand what they were asking?

That is ALL I am trying to get at, I promise you and everyone else here. I'm
not culture bashing... I just really really want to know why. And perhaps,
after all, the only person who can answer me without doubt might be that
Hassidic or Swahili or Chinese or Eskimo person.

In which case, I may never know. And of course, it may never matter.

I'm not going to answer this thread any longer (not that it matters to
anyone here), because it has become clear to me that no one really knows the
answer except this "person" who can't or doesn't speak English very well.
(and if that is, indeed, the case, then I cannot communicate with them,
after all) And I will *never* hold that against them... they're nature's
children, as are we all.

I do appreciate all the answering posts, even if they didn't *exactly*
answer my question. I am still grateful for all the information that I
gained.

Thank you all,
Dark
