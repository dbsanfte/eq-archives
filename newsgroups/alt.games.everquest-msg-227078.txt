Nah, no CIHYS. I am not going to be forced out of a game I am enjoying (and
laready subscribed for another 28 days for) by some incompetent pinhead CS.
Step 4 for me is finding every single Sony (not just SOE) email address and
forwarding my experiences onto them in a coherant and relative non whiney
manner. I had trouble getting my characters moved onto Stormhammer in the
first place (took them 6 days from when I subscribed) now a complete
clusterf_ck trying to move back to standard servers as I was browned off
about the billing stuffups whilst on Legends.

Venting in a newsgroup is one thing - sorry guys but it made me hot under
the collar to be told I was expected to be playing for 24 days without
access to any of my characters - but after working CS I know nothing is more
dangerous than a calm coherant "complaint" that starts off as a compliment
from a customer who has been legitimately stuffed around. If every person
who was stuffed around just got in a huff and left CS would have nothing to
be worried about....
