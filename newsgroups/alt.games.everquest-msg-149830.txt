I'm going to have to defend your boss.

Sony/VI has access to all schedules of all players.  They look for the one
day that is most inconvenient for their patches and set the date based on
that info.  Notice how there seems to be a correlation between changes in
patch days and changes in schedules?  I used to have Wednesday mornings to
play, that changed last month to Thursday mornings.  Now, it seems, patches
will be on Thurdays.  Quid pro quo.  (Well, I think it's proof)
