Calm down! :-)

If you take a look at eq.castersrealm.com, they have a listing of all the
skills and skill caps for the various classes. In your case, Offense caps at
210 until level 50, when it goes to 252. Various other ones also cap out at
post-200. Your weapon skills cap at 200 until 50, then 250 afterwards.

The only thing you have to worry about is if you want to get to 201 in a
trade skill.. you can only have 200+ in one trade skill, and it can't be
changed once one goes over.
