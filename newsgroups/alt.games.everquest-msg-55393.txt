Next to frankel the pirate is a new NPC who will port you to iceclad.
An idetically named one is at the pirate camp in iceclad to take you
home.

Was only on briefly forgot to write down his name but its something
like Bundreef.

Just say 'I want a ride'.

Hope this is permanent and that more boat replacements are on the way!
