There's an interesting series of quests in Cabalis for cudgels;
the final one ends up with a clicky mini-avatar that looks very
handy indeed.

To do them, of course, you need to make nice with the Iksars.

In the past, this involved endless killing of tons of sarnaks and
goblins, in fact my dwarf cleric achieved this status quite by
accident.

I started this quest on another server with my lizard shaman, the
early steps are tedious but far from impossible, the rewards suck
but you know you are heading for a very nice final result
somewhere down the road.

So this time I thought I'd try something new; the Essence of
Iksar potion.  Wow, hard to find.  Checked Bazaar everytime I was
in there and didn't find any till today.

Bought one, went down to FoB, and tried it out.  Was able to
stroll right up to the indifferent Trooper Mooter or whatever his
name is.  Started handing in bone chips.  120 chips later, I'm
still indifferent to him.  I'm Amiable to the Crusader standing
nearby.  I back well off, drop the illusion, and check.  KOS,
scowls to the trooper.  Same to the Crusader.

So I"m a long way off from being able to forgo the potions.  On
the other hand, they seem to work very well indeed, maybe I don't
need to do any faction work at all.  Or maybe there's better
faction work I can do inside, Curscale armor or so forth.

What I'm wondering is; has anyone used a potion to do the cudgel
quests?  How much faction is needed for them?

Also, how about the bone chip angle.  I'd like to somehow get on
the good side of sarnaks or goblins or both with this character,
but am I digging myself a deep deep hole for the bone chip angle
if I don't kill up to dubious first?

Lastly, how to start the quest?  Seems like the thing to do is
start a mule iksar shaman, gather the other materials, and have
him turn in his cudgel, then I hand in the rest of the junk and
get the reward.  Simple as that?
