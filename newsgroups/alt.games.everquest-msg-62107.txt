Er, the higher resolutions only squash your screen into a smaller area in 
the middle of your screen if you have 'screens same resolution' switched on 
in options and are playing in windowed mode. This option is just so that 
people playing in fullscreen mode can switch back to 640x480 windowed mode 
when they have to (to read a note, or to look at the spellbook for example) 
without having to wait for their monitor to switch resolutions.

Do yourself a favour. Change to a higher resolution, then hit F10 to get 
into fullscreen mode - you'll like it.
