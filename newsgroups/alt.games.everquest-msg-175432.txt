Ive never personally spoke to anyone who ended up being non-kos from the
bone chip quest.  Everyone that I know that has tried it, got bored and
frustrtated and simply gave up.  I am sure its been done though.  There
has to be someone out there that was determined enough to do it.

T> I've found this quest that starts in Cabilis that the end item is a sweet

T> the emerald.  Now, my faction with Legion of Cabilis is maxed from killing
T> goblins in Warslik Woods while farming the gobbie earring but I still
T> require better faction with the guards and the shaman guild.  I've since
T> then found the bone chip quest that will raise all the
T> right factions.  Question one is how many Gdamn bone chips do I have to hand
T> in?  I mean, I'm coming up on 3000 chips now and I'm still Ready to Attack.
T> Please tell me it's not too much more :) Secondly, I had a guild chanter
T> follow me to FoB and cast Illusion: Iksar on me and I went from Ready to
T> Attack to the crusaders to Dubious, totally skipping Threateningly, how many
T> faction points does an illusion accually give you?  Would this mean I'm not
T> that far into KoS and I won't have to hand in that many more Bone chips?
T> Sorry for the long ass story, just don't want to have to see another
T> bonechip in my life after this quest is done! :)
