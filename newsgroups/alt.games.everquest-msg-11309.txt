Nope, if you can get exp your skills can go up.  But, on those light greens,
they will go up -very- rarely.

Real Green: can't go up
Light green: Extremely rare increases
Blue: occaisional increases
White: better
Yellow: best increase rate
Light red: still decent
Deep red: increase rate lower on many skills than you'd see with
blues.

This last seems to be a function of successes.  It appears to me that
there are two checks for an increase, one independant of success,
and a second made whenever you make a successful check.  Using
a combat skill on a red you will see relatively few successes, and thus
lose most of this chunk of your potential success per attempt.

General answer is no, but there seems to be some sort of
exploit involving pets that may allow this, unless its been
nerfed.  I use the word exploit advisedly, it clearly is the
intent of Verant to not let you get essentially risk free skill
increases in this manner.

I have never used this item, but can answer some general questions:
Yes, your Hotkey method will work fine.  Keep in mind that you
have hotkey'd the slot, not the item, if you juggle things around
in inventory (for example after looting your body) you need to put
that idol back in the same slot for hotkey access.
Yes, that's how hotkey access to items works.
Don't know about interrupt or cast time on that item. Real DA cast
time is 0.5 seconds, and is very rarely interrupted.  On the other
hand a SOW potion, for example, takes quite some time to "cast"
and is incredibly easy to interrupt, since even channeling experts seem
to get no bonus.
You cannot gate or have any spell cast on you under DA.  You can
stand still, run, jump, sit, duck, begin camping... theres a lot you
can do, in fact, but no spell can be cast on or by you, and you are
completely invulnerable to any damage, now (since a recent patch)
even stun effects.  My first cleric used to use DA to get out of Kelethin
instead of learning the route to a lift.
I've never camped while under DA.  I'm told that despite the fact
that you are immune you will still stand up if hit, interrupting the
camp out.  DA only lasts 18 seconds while camp takes 30, so even
if it -doesn't- break camping to get hit in DA, you still won't make
it all the way unless something has distracted the thing that was
hitting you.  Common wisdom is to use DA and then /quit instead,
then hope that you live thru the time from DA wearing out to the
/quit actually registering with the system.

Some items vanish, like a Levitation ring, but others do not, like the
Stien of Muggok.  Many items with charge effects (the Stien for
example)_ are valued far more for their other properties than for
the charges anyway.
