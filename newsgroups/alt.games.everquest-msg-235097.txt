When you get up around level 20, look into forming a group and hunting in
Stonebrunt (and oasis for the snake poison sacs) to get the 4 components for
the Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies.  It's a 6/22 weapon that procs a 74-81dd
at level 20, and it's Non-LORE so you can have two.  Not the most amazing
weapon, but the procs will help you keep agro early on.  Here's a link to
the quest:

No real idea on what group you'll need, since I haven't done it myself
(though thought about it for my warrior on FV) but give it a try, the worst
that can happen is you die.  :P
