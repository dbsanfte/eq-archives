While Lightstones are indeed vendor loot if money is your object, you'd be a
fool to sell a GLS for less than 8pp... because there is a quest that involves
simply taking the stones to a gypsy in either NK, Oasis, or SRo and handing
them in for a =substantial= exp boost and a tome which sells to vendors
for 8pp.

In fact, one method which several of my starting characters (I've started
them on seperate servers, which meant I couldn't twink them) have used
this very fact as a get rich   quick scheme; make enough cash via "honest"
means to buy a GLS from someone at silly low amounts (3pp?  Incredible!
but I've seen people offering at this price) and run the quest, doubling
my money while getting outrageous exp off it.  Now I've got
enough to buy two, then four, then eight at a time... selling 8 Tomes to
vendors is 64pp, off a 3pp investment, and I've probably got enough
exp off the 15 stone hand-ins to make a couple levels at the same time.
Course at very low levels the trek to Oasis Gypsy camp isn't exactly a
cakewalk... but thats the risk versus reward equation at work for you!
