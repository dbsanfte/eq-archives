I tried it using a buddy key for a free trial sometime after release,
but it drove my system to its knees.  I can run around in PoK or the
bazaar with all PCs visible without any lag, and my system plays LOTRO
okay too with acceptable (though not maxed) graphics settings, but even
with most of the graphics turned way down I found Vanguard was far too
laggy to play, and if a lot of "new" content became visible at once
(like when I was running up an arching ramp leading to a tree-house elf
city and reached the point where the city would become visible) my whole
machine would lock up so badly I had to power cycle it.

What I did see of the game looked pretty nice.  I was intrigued by the
idea of the Diplomacy sub-game but never got a chance to try it because
I locked up too often just trying to reach the city with my trainer.
