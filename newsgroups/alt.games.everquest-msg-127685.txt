I've seen similar things with mobs lots of times.  But we had never
seen anything quite like this, and one of the guys in our group plays
a lot (even for an EQ addict).  So I'm thinking there's something new
going on.  This happened in both indoor and outdoor zones, and wasn't
related to any other lag that we could detect (e.g. I wasn't going
linkdead and losing sight of everyone).
