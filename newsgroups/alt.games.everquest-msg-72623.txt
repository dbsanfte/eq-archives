Ok, especially on luclin (but also elsewhere), my system has tiny 0.5 second
lockups quite often. It's a little freeze, but then continues. It's a
GeForce 3, Windows XP, an AMD Thunderbird 1 GHz CPU with the VIA chipset
on the motherboard and 512 MB of ram.

Anyone *know* (you have to to answer this .. guesses won't help much) if
there are issues with this setup (Either GeForce, or the AGP bus on
VIA chipset AMD CPU board etc)? Is there a way to check if things are
setup right? Do I need some special chipset driver for Windows XP?

I  know via had drivers (their 4in1 releases) for other Windows versions.
What about XP?
