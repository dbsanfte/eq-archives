Join nearly any guild and you'd have to have discipline and a steel will 
to -avoid- being twinked up with gear that's better than the very best 
stuff that existed in the original game, at any level.

New players don't need to compete, they are handed more than they need 
well into their 60s. And on top of that, they can buy stuff in the 
bazaar for a song that used to be the best stuff in the game.

They can play just fine without buying plat!!!
