Yup, the patcher says "Connecting..." and eventually i get this message
"Internet Connection Request Failed.  The Patch Service May Be Down.  Please
Check Your Internet Connection And Try Again."  Not to mention it really slows
down my system also...
Well, I know my internet connection is fine, but what really irks me is I don't
even have Luclin...anyways I should've expected this.  As long as I get to log
on sometime (like tommorow or the day after) it's okay.  But I can never log in
again after this I'm going to give someone an atomic wedgie...
