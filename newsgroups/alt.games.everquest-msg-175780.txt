All of these things are indications of whether or not God likes an area and
the people in it: the weather, appearance of rainbows, the success of sports
teams, the art it produces and whether or not non-violent 1st-time offenders
are convicted as violent criminals when they have been completely
cooperative with the authorities, and have never lied or been deceitful.

I would have to admit that if I did everything I was told to do, and
punished the same as someone who commits armed robberies and lies with every
single world they say, then I would not expect it to rain here ever again,
although the area will be spared from total destruction as long as I and
whatever other Christians live here because God likes this area and will
continue to seek out the hearts and minds of those who live here until this
stage is complete when the conventional church is gone and then he may still
not destroy this area as I said the second group of those saved may rise up
against the obvious tyranny and great a small island of ruled by Greek
rationalism and democracy

It says in Exodus somewhere that God will not destroy a city as long as only
10 Christians still live there, so I would have to expect that there are
probably thousands of Christians who still live here.

The outcome of the Super Bowl and the outcome of my trial in many ways
mirror one another and the fate of this region will be decided soon, I would
like to see California and Washington band together and take over the world
or at least throw up decent resistance against, I guess the area which was
once the United States and take it over again and reform it under the
original Constitution and maybe even under the same President and government
that already exists.

I guess I'm saying Mr. Bush is that you don't have to be a part of the New
World Order if you don't want, you seem like the kind of rascally scoundrel
the world needs to lead it right now and you don't need to do it through the
United Nations if you don't want. You still have a country under your
command and an army and the ability to create a new army and go out onto the
field of battle, not to placate and keep the peace, but to win against the
twin evils of fascism and communism which have been decaying our country
from the inside for years yet have not broken it.

Hell, there is a factory right in this area, the 3rd best factory in the
country in a world where most things are manufactured in Mexico and Canada
there are still factories in America, why do think they are here? Factories
can be used to build planes and tanks and bombs and guns, and even robotic
soldiers controlled by children who think they are playing a video game.
