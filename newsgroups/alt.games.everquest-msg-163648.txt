    Why cap when market forces do the job for you?

    Hrm but isnt the shadowknight horse cool? :) I cant wait to be able to
transport myself to some degree instead of being a piece of heavy equipment
that casters drag around because they need it <g>

    Hmmm I had loads of trouble getting to 10, how much easier was it made?
Was it just the death exp penality they squished or did gaining exp get
easier too?

    Yeah... it would've annoyed me no end if I'd spent all that effort
getting IC only to find some prick bought a better weapon in the bazaar the
other day. They need to extend the epics... some psycho weapon you trade IC
in for etc

    well, they're using directX... microbugs!

    Ive only got to lvl 36 and I found it extremely difficult to do so. 1-30
took a month but that was with some seriously heavy playing... I am playing
a shadowknight though - maybe its gotten much easier with other classes. Or
maybe it used to be even harder to get anywhere...

    The early game might not be as much of a mountain as it used to be, but
the no exp loss until 11 or whatever was no doubt needed for the normal
everyday people who began playing the game. As a nerdy veteran of many rpgs
and computer games I took to EQ rather easily and for the most part avoided
dying during the first 10 levels. But I have a friend who began recently who
spent her first two days messaging me and saying things like "I dont get it
and a skunk killed me", haha. Seriously who gives a plague rat's tail if the
first 10 levels are easier now? How long should people spend killing
beetles?

    And verant has hardly forgotten about you oldbies... the overwhelming
majority of the PoP stuff doesnt really apply to me at 36...

James
