I have a problem with account name changing
A while ago i created a character called Azalar who i played a few 
levels. He was a human druid.
After doing some research i thought a halfling druid might be better so 
i deleted Azalar and then tried to create a halfling druid with the same 
name.
Due to a policy that EQ has of holding onto deleted names just in case 
the deletion was an accident i couldnt reuse my own name.
Eventually i got them to undelete it rather than lose the name as i 
thought i would be able to use the character renaming service.
What i want to do is rename Azalar to something else then rename my 
halfling druid Xezor to be called Azalar but it wont let me do that.
I dont want to do this in 2 stages and have to be the riduculously 
overpriced $49 twice as i still have no guarantee that it wont hold onto 
the name because it might have been renamed accidentally(stupid logic 
yeah but its how Sony work).
I know most people wouldnt bother or just invent a new name but ive used 
the name Azalar over a number of rpgs and am quite fond of the name and 
would like to use it on EQ too.
Does anyone know a way around this?
