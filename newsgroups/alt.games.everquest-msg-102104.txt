Press members are only interested in stories about how evil computer games
are and how destructive they are to their communities. If you are not a
frothing, drooling idiot who exactly portrays the image they have in mind
when they set out to write the story then they would have very little
interest in you.

In the days past being a member of the press was a proffesion, now it is
just a trade. Ethics is what seperate trades from proffessions, and it has
been a long, long time since the press have concerned themselves with such
trivialities such as truth, integrity and honesty.
