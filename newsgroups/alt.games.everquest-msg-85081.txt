  Yep, I got the same impression, it's the main reason I haven't gone
out of my way to try to entice someone in to buying them for me.

  Compare the level 30 "Scream of Pain" with level 39 "Shadow Vortex"

  They both do the same thing (transfer AC from the target to the
caster).

  Scream of Pain taps 6 AC points and costs a whopping 100 mana
(that's a lot for a level 30ish hybrid, way too much if you're
pulling).

  Shadow Vortex taps 12 AC points and costs a very reasonable 40 mana.
It taps twice as much AC for less than half the mana.

  I'm getting this information from eq.castersrealm.com... it could
just be incorrect data pulled from a client side data file... they
don't even have the price of the spell listed on their web site, so
that tells me it hasn't exactly been thoroughly tested.

  If the information is right, though, these spells are pretty much
out of whack.
