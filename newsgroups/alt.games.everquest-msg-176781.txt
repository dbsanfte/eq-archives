You could try your hand at Acrylia studded armor, it doesn't sell all that
well anymore unfortunately.  PoTC kits still sell, but, your skill levels
are not really high enough for the sickle or the robe.  The good news is
that you could still profit on the robe, as the one expensive part made by a
jeweler is guaranteed to give you a robe, as it is returned on a failure.
Just don't expect many successful combines.  The Sickle is probably not
worth thinking about yet at a skill of 188.
