So, it does.... I've gotten so used to just hitting "delete" to back the
attribution line up against the top of the page... didn't ever think about
it.  Maybe it's because OE doesn't insert markup that I have to delete, as
well.

Basically, it comes down to something Miss Manners once said about
ettiquite.  It's simply the art of showing consideration for others.  All
the fancy rules of ettiquite boil down to that one point, the rest us
understanding the cultural norms that frame it.  Nettiquite is simplite
another form of ettiquite.

That, and the way we present ourselves is how we ask others to judge us.
