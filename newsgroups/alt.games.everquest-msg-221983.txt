I've played AC for 3+years and am currently playing SWG until my
subscription runs out in November, for those of you that have played both AC
and EQ.....what is your opinion on both games? how do they compare to each
other in community and questing?(which are the 2 main things I look for in a
game)

If you were looking for a new game right now knowing what you know about EQ
but having never played it, would you wait for EQ2 or do you think it's
worth it to jump in to EQ first?  Would it be as fun for the beginning new
player given that most players are probably high levels and the game mature
now?  Will everyone be jumping ship when EQ2 releases?

.....and if you have time maybe a brief description of the game, it's good
points and bad.


Thanks in advance

Dave
