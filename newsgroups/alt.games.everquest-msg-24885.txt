Not easy, Jazz.  On the one hand you have the pull for
friendship/camaraderie.  On the other is going to see all the cool stuff in
this game that you are paying for.  (And can't get to w/o others).

I suggest alliances.  You keep your autonomy but you get uber members of
guilds like yours (who are probably your friends anyway) and get the best of
both worlds.

Head over to the Druzzil Ro message boards, my friend.  We don't have all of
the answers.  We even inherited lots of problems when the Fenin move
occurred (I was from Fenin).  We do have civility, though.  Even from the
uberest of guilds.  Check out our raid boards (among others).  There was a
post there just today about how alliances can --and do-- work.

P.S. Counter-jinx!!
