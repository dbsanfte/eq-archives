Talk about being dramatic. :P

I think it's easy to jump to the conspiracy conclusion in this case, 
seein' as how we're talking about big bad SoE. However, I think there is 
just as much evidence to support the theory that it was just a case of 
them trying their hand at yet another angle on the EQ franchise and 
coming up a little short. There are plenty of PC games released these 
days that leave a lot to be desired. SoE just happened to have the offer 
of a beta invitation to throw in to boost sales and likely make the 
difference between a business loss and a money-making venture.

As cynical as I am, I believe this to be closer to the truth.

Wow. That does sound like quite teh suk. I'd be pretty bitter too. I 
think I'll stick to the 'burbs with aspirations for a nice rural setting 
one day. ;)

If it did, in fact, get to the point where they were moving all sorts of 
merchandise with the added bonus of beta invitation, then yeah, I'd admit 
that they were selling the invitations. It's not that prevalent though. 

Legends subscribers get it (for $40/mo., they darned well *better* get 
some perks) and the initial LoE purchasers get it (done to boost the 
sales of their mediocre RTS offering). I still wouldn't call it selling 
beta accounts.

A better example of what you claim would be Blizzard's deal with 
FilePlanet to offer the WoW beta to all FP subscribers. In that case 
Blizzard isn't rewarding anyone for purchasing their products. They are 
merely capitalizing on the massive interest in the beta.
