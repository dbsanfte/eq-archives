A long time ago, I saw a post on this forum showing the perspective of
each of the major classes, all of whom felt their role was boring and
everyone else got to have all the fun. If anyone has it archived, 'd
like a dejanews link, but it was something like:

Fighter: Great, I get to stand here and attack/taunt/kick, while
everyone else casts cool spells. 

Mage: All I get to do is spam nukes, I can't even see what's going on
with the all the blinky lights. At least fighters get to be up there
in the thick of it. And if one creatures aggroes on me, I'm dead.

Except that it was much better written.

I like my role as Crusader. Yeah, I'm a meat shield. I feel good when
I can taunt a creature off the healer and hold aggro while the rest of
the party does its job. Keeping an eye on mobs drifting off, doing my
part to bring off group HOs, and so on is fun and challenging. It's a
good role on a team -- if I fail to keep the creatures off the
healers, they'll die, then, without them, I'll die. My Crusader
abilities to ward/intervene strengthen this defensive role, and I'm
looking forward to Paladin abilites.

My main bitch is that pulling off group HOs means I can't use my own
specials as much as I'd like, but I think with better coordination and
practice, that will change. I would be more useful if I was able to do
my full damage dealing, as I do when I'm solo.
