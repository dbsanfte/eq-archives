Oh, trust me, it's better than no news server, but even Knolegy (Think
that's how the company name is spelled. It was weird) could provide me
with their own news server... *Shrug* Comcast finally broke down and
threw us a bone when we complained about lack of news server, but that
doesn't mean I can't complain that the bone sucks.
