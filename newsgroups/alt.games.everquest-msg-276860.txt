Venril Sathir, the Overthere Outpost faction and as of - what, Two
weeks ago? - the Firiona Vie docks.  There is one lvl 35 NPC I can kill
to get good faction, up in Veeshans Peak somewhere (elven dancer, or
somesuch).  The rest are lvl 60+ dragons.  There's two quests to get in
good with Venril Sathir, both require good faction with them to begin
with.

Interestingly, Iksar monks, and I presume by the similar lack of
casting perhaps Iksar warriors?, CAN get in good with Firiona Vie by
killing ~2000 goblins in Lake of III Old Men, so at least they can
manage to get about.  But Shadowknights and Necromancers, at the least,
must go around the long way of PoK->E. Freeport->(W. Freeport|E.
Commons)->North Ro->Oasis->Timerous then hope no-one trained Oowomp or
similar guy to the docks.  The alternative of going through
Butcherblock is not viable for Iksar SK/Necros because of the inability
to ever get in good with Firiona Vie.  Wouldn't that be fun? :) Port
from BB to the Firiona TD port and HELLO MR ELF! OH
CRAPPINGONTHEDOCKSPORTMEBACKMRTRANSLOCATORSIRIMEANMAAMOOOOO! I'm dead.

Xiphos - Granted, most of the TD FV elves are green or light blue to my
Iksar SK now, but what about others just starting out?
