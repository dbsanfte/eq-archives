As a boat zones it it pauses, this is so the people that zone in slower
don't get dumped in the water (I believe if this happens now you are spawned
at a safe spot and not dropped in the drink but this wasn't always the case)
Yes it is often faster to swim ashore than wait for the boat to get moving
again, Bloated Belly to the Outpost in Kunark being a prime example.
