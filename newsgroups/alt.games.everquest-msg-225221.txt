I think people have a tendency to not realise how quickly time goes by when
in EQ. For example - they may farm for a while and pick up 3K or so and then
think - how long did this take? 45mins or an hour proberly when in fact if
they had timed it it would have been far longer.

I know I was guilty of it on the spider silks - I thought each hunting
session in EK would have taken 20 minutes or so but when I timed it they
took between 40 and 50 minutes on average. So 2 hunting sessions there take
about 90 minutes, not including travel time to and from zone. If I had been
questioned before writing down the times I would have estimated far less
time than that and hence my estimates on how much I made would have been
greatly exagerated - perhaps by as much as 200%.
