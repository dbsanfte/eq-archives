Now that killing orcs improves frostone faction (I'm up to warmly using
faction song),  I figured I'd check if any new quests opened up.  The
historian talks about a hero named Glight whose ghost may perhaps be found.
This is not the 'spirit of garzicor' quest which has a ghost of Burdael.  He
says Glight died in cc in an area called glight's falls which has what looks
like a waterfall "frozen in time".  Not sure what that means.  I've been
everywhere in cc and took a look through the zone.  There's the waterfall by
the bridge, but it doesnt look frozen to me and no ghost.  No mention of
Glight in Allakhazam.  Anyone know if this text is new or has always been in
game, and if it leads to anything?
