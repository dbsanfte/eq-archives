This isn't the problem with the SBlive sound. I have had this problem for
over a year. Sound works great in 98/ME but try running it in XP/2000 and
the sound sucks. All cards are on different IRQs. Running 98 sound worked,
did a fresh install of XP and the sound problem returned. No hardware was
changed.
