Have somebody cast identify on them. You'll see that they are two different
runes, though they look identical and have the same name.  Here's a tip on how
to tell the difference. Go to any merchant and offer each rune to them. They
will offer a little more money for the higher level one. Save you having to muck
about with identify spells.
