www.bidfraud.com "Grand Opening" -- Read Inside for capabilities

After 1000 plus hours in development - Bidfraud.com is "breathing."

http://www.bidfraud.com

Features:

Capable of archiving ebay auction transactions locally on our server.
This is important, as ebay deletes transactions every few months.  It
is as simple as entering an ebay item number when creating a report.

example of archived ebay page:

http://www.bidfraud.com/cachedpages/6113839605/alouette-amusement/6113839605.html

The above archived page, while it still exists at bidfraud.com, no 
longer exists at ebay.com

Report templates contain an area to write a narrative as well as an
interface to upload as many as 10 images/files (word & excel, etc.)
The use of pictures as well as other supporting documents will help
to substantiate & validate a claim.
