Hi All.

Have checked a few places here and there on this quest and found the
information lacking. I hail Trade Commissioner Henry and get a reply
that tells me I need to 'register to trade'. While I am trying to get
this quest started what am I missing here, as I replied to him that 'I
will register to trade', but still nothing about any newsletters.

I am playing a 51 Iksar Beastlord and want to gain faction on the moon
so I can start doing my Epic Quest, etc. and be able to train there.

Thanks for any help.
