Have you run a ranger or druid?  I can't tell from your posts.  You seem to be
comparing snaring effects to not having snaring effects, when the arguement is
comparing darkness for snare versus snare for snare.  This is like comparing
having an apple or starving to death, when the discussion is whether apples or
oranges are a better food.

This reply of yours is the first place I've seen where you seem to get that we
aren't any of us arguing that we'd rather not have any snare at all rather than
use darkness.

I know you know there is a DOT in Darkness.  But I don't see you comparing cheap
and low resist snare with expensive and high resist darkness.  I see you going
back to the fact that snaring is a good practice and that darkness accomplishes
that.

Now with this paragraph you finally start to look at the key issue.  But you
don't address it, you just mention it offhand.  Yes, Darkness has a DOT
component.  But it isn't a very mana efficient one, if you were fighting a mob
that didn't need to be snared, would you cast it for the damage it does, or
would you go with a straight DOT?  In many fights, DOTs are even less mana
efficient than they might seem on the surface, because the mob dies before the
DOT takes its full effect.  When you keep saying that you don't need a 14 minute
snare, you flirt with this part of the issue; Darkness is an inefficient DOT
that will almost certainly be even less efficient because its highly unlikely
that the mob will live precisely one or two or three darkness durations, and yet
you'll keep casting it because you need that mob to stay snared (assumming he
didn't die before the end of darkness one).  And its expensive compared to the
Snare line.

I do think a 2 for one spell can be a neat thing... but often it isn't.  For one
example, consider druid roots (which I already mentioned earlier), for another,
how about cleric stuns; we get one that does no damage, then a series that have
a DD component. Guess which one I cast more often than all the others combined?
The no damage one.  Why?  Same thing as the snare versus darkness arguement,
same thing as the druid root versus cleric root arguement; because it is A)
cheaper B) less resisted C) faster casting and D) doesn't break mez.

Druid root and cleric Stun+DD spells are still better for point D than the
Darkness line, though, because both are DD, once cast you can then mez the
target all you like; Darkness on the other hand is a DOT, which means that once
its on the mob there's no hope of mezzing it if you have to.

Are there circumstances where the spell lines with damage are worth using?
Yes.  1) if they are all you have or 2) if your combat plan is predictable and
never includes mezzing or unmezable mobs.  I'm willing to concede that having a
DOT snare combo has its uses in terms of saving a spell slot, although I
actually find it hard to believe you wouldn't be just as well off with 7 spell
slots and a no DOT snare.

Besides the mez factor and duration, you aren't addressing the other differences
between darkness and snare; snare slows mob movement down more, snare is cheaper
to cast, snare is resisted less often.

Reread these two posts, which I left in just as you quoted them.  Poster says
"you are ignoring the DOT".  You reply "there's no need for 14 minute snare".
Do you really think thats an excellent example of you discussing the DOT
component?  I'd say the reverse, a fantastic example of you ignoring the
discussion about the down sides of having a DOT component, instead switching
topics back to the 14 minute duration issue.

You believe it, I'll grant.  But unless this is a religious issue, I'd rather
see you discuss it than just state a belief.  I've seen the exact things happen
that we are discussing; a mob gets darkness cast on it, and then another mob
shows up that can't be mezzed for one reason or another (immune to mez is not
the only reason, it may be too high level for your mezzer, it may have too high
a resist, it may have been dotted from some other source; the reason isn't
important, the fact that it can't be mezzed is the key)  but you can't mez the
original mob due to it being dotted.  In fact, DOTs are often outlawed entirely
in group play for this reason, the fact that this includes darkness but not
snare should be pretty telling.

Whoa, hold the phone, level 29 spells are not used only in plane raids.  In
fact, most of this discussion applies just as well to Snare as to Ensnare, but
even the part that is Ensnare related only applies for characters as low as...
level 29, definately a far cry from planar.

Thread Drift is a fact of Usenet, get used to it. However, since it bugs you I
changed the title of the subthread.  Took me all of 5 seconds.

Snare is cheaper than darkness, Snare is resisted less often than Darkness,
Snare doesn't break Mez like Darkness does, Snare lasts longer than Darkness.
And at level 60 a druid will still be casting Snare just as often as Ensnare, ie
whenever duration is guaranteed not to matter.,

Nobody is getting into an advanced tactics contest or a character pissing
contest here.  We are coldly discussing the pros and cons of Snare line versus
Darkness line.  Or at least attempting to do that.  Our debating opponent seems
to be bound and determined to ignore any unpleasant points, and only reluctantly
makes any interesting points on his side of the scales.

Your point that having a DOT combined with the snare sometimes gives you a
cheaper way of doing small amounts of  damage without using an extra spell slot
is a worthwhile one, on topic and bringing up a point that wasn't addressed by
anyone on the "Snare is better" side.  I'd like to explore that further, say
with your spell lineup that shows you using all 8 slots in such a way that
swapping in Snare (if such a thing were possible for a necro) wouldn't do the
job better in the long run.  But its a point in your favor at least.

Another point you make, obliquely, is that 14 minutes is longer than it tends
to take to kill a mob.  This is true... however, its also the point; cast
Ensnare once and you usually won't have to cast it again on that mob.  Darkness
line spells, on the other hand, require a fast killing group to get this same
level of utility; you are probably going to either have to wait to cast (which
means its not on the mob for such things as enchanter protection) or you are
going to have to cast more than once.  Further, mobs can be parked with Ensnare
and Root or Ensnare and Mez, and still be snared when you get around to them;
this isn't nearly as likely to be true with darkness line.  Even if you aren't
using the 14 minutes, the point is rather that you have a snare that's use once
and done, unless you go ludicrously long and actually see that 14 minutes wear
out.  Seeing Darkness line spells wear off is, on the other hand, typical in all
but best case scenarios.

To sum up the points under discussion:
Snare line resisted less often
Snare line cheaper to cast
Snare line stacks with mez
Snare line longer duration
Ensnare (in the snare line, admittedly higher level) has much much longer
duration
Darkness has DOT component in case you need cheap damage but want to save a
spell slot.

As a special extra credit assignment consider the mana to damage ratio of
Darkness versus spending the same mana on snare plus a comparable level DOT

Oh, and if you really want to complain, consider Bard snare, at no mana cost,
has a Slow component.  Note that this seems to have the same low resist as Snare
line, stacks with mez since slow doesn't break mez, and none of its duration is
wasted in a normal fight since you are either using its movement component or
its slow component at any given time.  Of course the duration of 18 seconds does
kind of suck, or would if you couldnt just keep putting it back...
