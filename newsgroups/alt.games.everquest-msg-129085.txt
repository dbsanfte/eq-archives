i don't support any killing of innocent people in ANY way... i'm just saying
that more than 10 times as many Palestinians have been killed as a result of
this "defense", and its being completely ignored.

The Palestinians are WRONG for killing the 100 or so Isrealis.. but let's
not forget the 1000+ dead Palestinians that have been killed by Isreal.
The Palestinians are retalliating against harsh oppression.  They've chosen
the wrong answer, but what comparably support do they have?
Isreal is committing the BIGGER crime!

examine the motives.. and see who is the true cause.
