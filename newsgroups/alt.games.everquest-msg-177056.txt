So I guess being a prophet of God doesn't mean that you can predict the
future, I am coming to that conclusion, not like I went to prophet school or
anything. Hey, EVERYONE thought the Raiders were going to win, even the
newspaper predicted it so it's not like I had a monopoly on predictions
there.

Anyway, I was rewarded quite handsomely financially for doing what God told
me to do today and for proving that I had faith and patience and an interest
to learn more about the Bible, my goal of being able to prophesy for 3.5
years to the world in an antagonistic manner in the spirit of Rev. 11 may
come to a reality after all.

Apparently I am also allowed to do this on Sunday now as a preacher works on
Sunday, so am I allowed to work on Sunday doing this if I wish.
