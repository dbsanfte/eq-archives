Jump in and enjoy.  Many of us have multiple characters that we play,
so the level 1 killing rats next to you in Qeynos might be a Level 60
Cleric.  

There are plenty of newbie areas, and generally people are pretty
friendly about helping a new player find his or her way.  It won't
take long and all this chatter will seem totally plausible to you.

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
