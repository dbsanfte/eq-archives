WindupAthiest,

You write:

Sort of. If you become adept at blacksmithing, you can smith
your own plate armor, which with a little help can be dyed
any of a variety of colors. This plate makes quite good
entry-level gear, but it's generally considered too
expensive to make (and to learn to make) to be worth it,
unless you really love detailed customization. Also, you
have to choose a race/class that can wear plate armor to
take advantage of it. Mob-dropped armor pieces (which
accounts for most of the mid to high-end), each have a
specific color based on what set they belong to. However, in
general, you'll probably find appearance less customizable
in EQ.

> What do they give you?

1. A little story and flavor: soandso lost his daughter and
he wants you to find the diary pages from the bad people or
monsters who kidnapped her, etc. They usually make you visit
somewhere or talk to NPCs that you might not normally if you
were on a tight power path.

2. Faction (i.e. a good reputation) with the group that the
NPC who gave you the quest belongs to. No matter what
race/class you start with there will always be some NPCs who
hate you (and will attack you on site), and there are
sometimes reasons you want certain groups to hate you less.

3. Items, but very few quests that can be accomplished solo
and at low levels yield items worth using. (Some also give a
little cash, again not more than you would have gotten
adventuring during the time you spent on the quest.)

> I like the idea of playing a troll or an ogre.

Humans are probably the most customizable, since more
equipment fits them, and they have a wide range of class
choices. Larger races are less flexible, but again you have
8 character slots to try out different options.
