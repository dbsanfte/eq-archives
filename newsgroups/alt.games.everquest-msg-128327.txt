LOL, wow! thread is still going hehe.  And thank you Taras, I couldn't have
said it better myself, I was getting worried that all of you were verant
worshipers, or were payed to defend the EULA agreement of verant.  Just a
reminder... the game was sold almost 13 hours after I started thread, and
yes I did give them my old acct with the purchase of the game.  I knew ebay
would take it down after a certain time, so I had to act quick :P  And to
Dark Tyger, I think employment with verant would be something you might look
into.  Oh well, EQ is no longer part of my life, thank god.  Now, lets see,
it seems they are letting you sell DAoC accts on ebay!  Off to the DAoC.bbs
muahaha!

You all have a nice day :)
