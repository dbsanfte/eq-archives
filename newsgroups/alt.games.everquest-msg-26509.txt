I try to offer what I can and roleplay the request a little. My best memory
was was a CR in Oasis after losing a level with my young Druid. I fought
a few greens bare handed in EC on the way back for coin to buy a stack of
tiny daggers. After I entered Oasis I offered a SoW, my first born and a
stack of tiny daggers( all delivered of course)for a clarity and got buffed
to the moon by a high level Enchanter and his friends.
