What about when the raid mob is up, and the guild isn't remotely ready 
to take it... so they build a wall while they all phone/IM/page their 
members to logon and get their asses over...

Meanwhile another guild which is able to assemble a suitable force 'now' 
is barred from entry, because they've 'claimed it' even though they 
won't be able to even try to take it for another 20 minutes
