Right, that sounds familiar.

From what you've said, there's no way that a Vah Shir's night vision
is as good as a dark elf's.  I'm sure I'd been noticing the change
from night to day, although I'm also sure it didn't particularly
affect my ability to get around.  I also play a wood elf bard on AB,
and from memory I'd say his night vision isn't as good as a Vah Shir.

It's just occurred to me that it could be the amount of light in this
room.  Normally I have the curtains pulled and sit in the dark, but
it's been so sunny here in Gloucestershire over the last couple of
days that it's been relatively light even with the curtains pulled.
If that's all it is, I shall feel pretty silly.  Perhaps some
blackouts would give my graphics card a boost.  :)
