Such

    How many clerics that want their epic "NOW" end up quitting EQ shortly
afterwards? I've seen enough people quit EQ right after getting their dream
loot (or the loot that put their E-Bay value over a specific limit). Lists
mean that instead of having five guilds, all of which end up hating one
another, wasting time staring at a patch of rock you have five people or
less staring at it, waiting to call people in. It saves EVERYONE who wants a
cleric epic someday a lot of time. Sucks to be you if you're in a guild that
could steamroll it? Yup, but I have enough to be thankful for. I'd rather I
suffer than some cleric that couldn't steamroll and has no chance at their
epic without such an agreement.

    I doubt they remembered I don't have my epic. I'm one of three clerics
(out of 20 or so?) in the guild that doesn't have it, and one of the three
is fairly high on the list. I would have asked for it to be removed, but
it's a nice symbol that I'm a cleric so what the hey.
