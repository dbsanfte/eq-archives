We finally did it, Rathe Council dead, and most of the guild is now Time 
flagged.  Was not looking good for a bit, a ranger lagged bad, and trained 
part of the raid, fortunately, the enchanter group was not affected, so we 
still had 6 locked down, rezzed, rebuffed, and pulled the OT councilmen 
again, dropped them all, and kill that Avatar of Earth.
