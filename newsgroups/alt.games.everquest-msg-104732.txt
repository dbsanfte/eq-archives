I had same problem; but i can't play the demos for long; maybe your card is
dying like mine did. Fortunately, mine is under warranty. Also, problem
happened swapping to xp. Maybe xp uses the card more intensively that win
me? Noooo idea.

I've heard there are much better cards out there if you can afford it; with
a similar system i can't get luclin to work well for me, even when the card
was working properly.
