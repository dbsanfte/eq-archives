I'll admit that I'm a KEI addict. For the past 12 levels or so I've been getting 
c3s for my solo quads lol. It's so very difficult to not have a c3 after you've 
seen its powers.

In any case, what do level 60 enchanters feel about people who request c3 for a 
donation? Whenever I'll be soloing I do a "who all enchanter 60" and see if 
anyone's in a druid port zone or in the nexus or bazaar. Then I send a tell 
"Might I donate for a c3?" Unless the person's afk the answer is always yes. If I 
couldn't afford to give a donation I would never ask in the first place.
