"Yes, Elliot," I said. "You remember, the place where you read all those wil
d rumors."
Roland did his thoughtful thing again. "Even if Michelle confounded our expe
ctations," he said. "I don't see how we could afford her. You know that the 
studios don't throw any sort of money at all to these things."
She then organized her neighborhood to operate around the councils and clash
ed with them repeatedly over their edicts. With a young Pole who was rumored
 to be her lover, she operated a black market, somehow finding meat and swee
ts when the Germans allowed only turnips and beets to be sent into the ghett
o. When the Nazis ordered the Jewish councils to find "volunteers" for depor
tation, Rachel , working desperately, found her neighbors work in armament p
lants or hid them, delaying but ultimately failing to stem the death flow ou
t of the ghetto. She fought alongside the remaining Jews during the ghetto u
prising for two weeks, one of the very few women left in the ghetto to do so
; in the third week, against her better judgment, she attempted to escape th
e ghetto with her young Pole. They actually did it, only to be turned in by 
one the Pole's "friends". He was shot and killed; she was sent to Treblinka.

One of the Yherajk meeting us in the hangar pointed at Van Doren as the cube
 melted away. "Who is that?" it asked.
