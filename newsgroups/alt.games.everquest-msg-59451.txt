Crappy charmed pet? hint charm a krup wizzy, tash it, give it a rusty dagger,
SoS it.  now you have a pet who quads for 100+ insanely fast and nukes for a
good amount of damage.  You can KS your group, sometimes by a wide margin if
you dont have damage dealers.  Not bad for a crappy pet =D

Note for group charmers:  Keep up the lvl 4 mezz for a fast remezz and charm if
your pet gets pissy =P.  Also the reason to charm a wizzy is A) they nuke B)
they tend to cast spells, giving you time to easily remezz/tot it/charm C) when
you land the level 4 mezz you can ToT them to regain mana and re charm, so it
becomes a mana free charm ^_^.  Krup wizzies rock, shammies are good too, not
as fast killing, but the do the slowing for me ^_~.
