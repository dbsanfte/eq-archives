Well I'm not married to the 80% line, but if you agree with my
theories about mana regen and expenditure then you'll come to the
conclusion that 80M and 40M are largely identical; you don't get
any more mana regen at any point as long as you never get to FM. 
Interestingly, getting to OOM still doesnt' blow your mana regen
assuming you don't wipe because of it.

Ah but the "much fun nuking" on the inital couple of fights
aside, there's no difference between sticking to 40M and sticking
to 80M if all is going well.  Personally, I'd rather try and get
in my groove early on, rather than blow thru mana fast and then
have to learn (and have the rest of the party readjust)
moderation later.

Aye, likely so, and its also likely that if you have to nuke so
hard and fast that 40M isn't enough than you'll end up dying
before you can spend all 80M... as a healer things tend to work
differently.

This plan does have one advantage, which is that you can use it
to split up a static camp; burn thru mana at a faster rate than
normal to get it split, then kill at your normal rate as the
respawn spread hits the optimal point; its possible that you'll
never manage to get your mana back up but you won't be needing it
anyway, because you only needed more while doing that initial
split.

Of course if someone goes LD or drops a soda on his keyboard you
might change your mind about needing the extra mana after all...

Thats the basic common sense core of what I'm saying, most groups
naturally find this sort of pace on their own; everyone
constantly using their resources to the best they can without
gradually using them up.
