Except it doesn't work like that.  If you make a key on your 6 button bank
and drop it into your 10 key bank, then change the button on the 6 key bank
it also changes the key on the 10 key bank.  That's why he was asking how to
get around the limitation.  Unfortunately you cant.  The best you can do is
check if any skills are duplicated in the combat key set.
