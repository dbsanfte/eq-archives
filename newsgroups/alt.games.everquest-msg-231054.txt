Hey all.
 
Well, after  a 2 year hiatus of EQ, I rejoined. Wow! Its changed and
the menus are 100 times better! Right on Sony!
 
One bug still persists I see. I recall before having the PC freeze up
going from the boat from Faydwer to Antonica. As you enter Freeport
the thing hangs. I've had about 3 computer upgrades since then too!
NONE of the hardware is the same as 2 years ago.
 
Well it froze TWICE today already. I still hav'nt made it to Freeport.
 
Any suggestions?
