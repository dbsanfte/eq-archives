255, if you want to maximize the probability of a raise.

Yes.  For example, with my maxed out mana pool, I have only 198 wisdom,
however, when I do tradeskills, I have 216 wisdom, but about 120 mana less
in my pool, because wisdom affects skill up chances, not mana pool.  (of
course, the fact that for normal (read: dungeon) hunting I have a Sarnak
Battle Shield (no wis, no mana) in my offhand, whereas for soloing or
tradeskills I have my trusty Testament of Vanear (10 wis 10 mana))

I'm really not sure what you're getting at here, but at any rate you say
that face mana items are suck, I point to the Enshrouded Veil, 7 ac 2 wis 2
int 10 sv fire 30 hp 30 mana.
(in other words, for your comparison, 2 wis 30 mana)

You also seem to have left off items held in the hand, or range slot items.
Note: Othmir Prexus Totem goes in either hand or range, however it's lore so
I put it in range so that a PKT could go in one hand

Range
    Wis        Othmir Prexus Totem (18 wis)
    Mana     Frozen Orb (3 wis 40 mana)

Main Hand
    Wis        Pearl Kedge Totem (18 wis)
    Mana     Platinum Dragon Totem (50 mana)

Off-hand
    Wis        Shield of Bane Warding (20 wis)
    Mana     Orb of the Infinite Void (5 wis 75 mana)

However, keep in mind that for maximum Mana pool, you want to get wisdom to
255 with as many +mana items as you can, thus the OoIV is superior to the
SoBW, because it has a high +mana, whereas you can get 255 wis with the OPT
and PKT easily.
