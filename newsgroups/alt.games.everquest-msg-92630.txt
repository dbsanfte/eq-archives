Yes it does have to have a weapon.

Since Disarm goes up quickly, it's easy to notice that you can
spend ten minutes disarming non-wielding mobs and nothing happens,
while you can get several skill-ups in a minute or two disarming
a mob that has a weapon.

And thankfully, you don't have to succeed to get a chance at
a skill up.  "Misses" are good for skill-ups as well.
