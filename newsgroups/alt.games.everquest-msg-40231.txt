They are a huge time sink whereby up to 60 plus players get together
for the purpose of killing things, or possibly one thing, in an area
such as Kael or Temple of Veeshan or what not. You basically need an
uber guild to do TOV. There are degrees of uber also with regular uber
guilds being the norm then Super duper guilds that can do anything
possible including killing tunare. 

The time sink part enters in because to do such areas right is going
to take 6 or more hours of your playing time. The purpose of such
guilds is to outfit the members in the uber stuff which drops there.
As you can well imagine, with taking as much as 6 hours plus to outfit
only a couple of people (if you are lucky) feelings are hurt and
problems arise from how the loot is distributed. No method really well
work well since this part of the game simply does not work "well."
There is no way that 35 plus people can do something taking 6 plus
hours which only can reward a couple of them and have all 35 feel that
it was "fair" or time "well spent." 

What you get from an uber guild depends partially on luck and your
class. For example, for my druid from what I've seen I am better off
killing stuff for xp alone or farming a couple things than going on
most guild raids where virtually nothing drops for me. This is
different though in TOV where the leather actually does drop about as
well as anything else for a change. 

If your life gets more busy say like with a 40 hour a week job or
something, as mine has, you soon fine you often simply don't have the
time for these uber raids. Eventually as the people you've played with
on the server for a couple years grow up, more and more of them either
don't have enough time at all and leave the game or they can only uber
raid on weekends along with every other uber guild on their server
which evetually causes the bottleneck problem. Soon you have too many
uber guilds competiting.

An uber guild almost becomes like a big corperation. There will be a
CEO and some upper management and then some peons and such. Often the
ceo and upper management are going to reap the most benefits and loot
from what the guild does even thought they can do nothing without the
peons. Loot might be tiered in some way and the peons will get the
crumbs. Eventually the ideal is that as you outfit the top people in
the TOV armor or whatever, then the lower people will get theirs.

The game is made so that in order to get the uber things you have to
go through this crap. I see it as a flawed design but some people
really like it, the people able to be charismatic enough and devote
enough time to be at the top of the uber guild pyramid really like it.

Eventually, some time after level 50, your character has to either
join an uber guild or just group and farm on its own. For the most
part it will never get the best things in the game or even planes
armor without the uber guild unless it is a special class like the
cleric who might be welcome on a planes raid as a guest and will prob
ably even get cleric armor drops since that armor drops an awful lot
in hate.

The whole uber thing is pretty daunting for me and after having
experienced it in EQ I never would in another game. Its just too much
work for too little reward. In order to work well it has to be such a
well organized corperate like machine that it soon becomes no fun.

For that reason, I was really looking forward to AO. AO fixes that
problem by not really needing uber guilds at all since you can get
upgraded cool armor all alone in a mission. AO is flawed in so many
more basic play areas and needing extreme requirements to play it at
al well that the fact you can play it without needing lots of people
to hold your hand is moot. AO is also missing all of the content that
EQ has from faction (except for the two sides) to a reason for being
there to killing gods eventually.

I'm hoping DAOC won't require uber guilds for basic needs but rather
that each side such as midgard or whatever can instead have just a
bunch of social guilds for the most part who come together to raid the
other sides, more for realm points than items.
