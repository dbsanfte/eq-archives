Yep, I like medding in near complete safety, I can load the dishwasher,
fix breakfast, whatever I like.  No way on the planet I could do that
in root/dot mode.

Too, many mobs I fight aren't aggro at all but do frenzy.  Taking down
Avocets, for example; easy enough while nuke kiting to not get any
adds, and never get an add between fights.  But sitting on me arse
medding while the DOTs do their job, odds are not at all against a
harrier or rook wandering by and deciding to "help".
