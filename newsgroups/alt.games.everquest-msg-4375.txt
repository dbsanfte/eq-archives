Ignoring?  No, it just so happens that I have a job and don't live the
luxury of sitting and flaming people all day.

It is not rude for you to know what I am wearing in public.  For you to see
that my Shadow Knight is wearing black colored bracers, is of no concern.
But for you to know if they are blackened iron or darkforge is none of your
business, if you want to know simply ASK.  Let's look at the Erudite.  If I
am wearing a robe and a necklace, sure you can see the robe, they are even
graphically represented by the coding of EQ.  But for the necklace, well I
guess we could get into an argument about style next, but I don't wear
necklaces all dangling out for the world to see.  In order for you to see
that you'd have to take off his hood and pull back collar of his robe.  What
about leggings?  You wouldn't be able to tell that I'm wearing feathered
leggings or raw silk unless I lifted up my robe for you ... or you took the
liberty to do it yourself.  Sure, if I wearing a ring you can see that.
You'll be able to tell if it's a wooden ring or a gem studded ring, etc.
But my point is not about the limitations of the game.  I point is simply
about taking the time to do what is right and ask.

Now explain why you can't use some common courtesy and simply ask before you
inspect?
