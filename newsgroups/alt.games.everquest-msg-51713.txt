Ok, my short trading anecdote goes like this.  I'm in Halas,
and someone auctions, "WTS high quality bear skin".
I send a tell to him, trying to be helpful, saying "You should be able
to get about 45pp for that".  He replies, "I'll sell it to you for 30pp."
So I said, "You're willing to forgo the 15pp?".  He says, "No, I want
at least 20pp".  An obvious misunderstanding, but he just now told me I
could
buy it for 20pp!  I decided to be nice and say, "I'll buy it for 25pp."
Done.
I then turned around and sold it within 30 minutes for 43pp to someone
auctioning to buy.    Profit of 18pp is very nice for a lowbie!

The trick is to have have the capital you need to buy stuff, and to
recognize a low
price when you see it.  And the latter isn't easy unless you've been around
for a while.
