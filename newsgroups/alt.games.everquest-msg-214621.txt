Does it count if you only played them to ~24? Ogre shaman. It was more about
fooling with faction then anything else. Got them to the point where they
could bank/sell in Freeport, Highhold, and Qeynos if they avoided a few of
the religious and mage types.

In a group it doesn't matter. If you solo, go for WIS.

Mine is an old character that was put away with gear that was popular 4
years ago. I mostly have crappy wisdom stuff, like silver jasper +2 wis
jewelry, and some high AC.

In a group it doesn't matter since you are medding most of the time.

Solo even with the lousy gear they can still do a fairly good job of root
and DOT. They don't have the mana pool to handle adds, but enough to finish
a single mob. The AC makes it so it isn't too bad being beat on while trying
to get a spell off.
