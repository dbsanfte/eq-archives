Its near the Bazarr zone line.  From there, go up the stairs and left along the

narrow ledge right above that area.  In the door, you'll see two vendors, one
sells pottery sketches or  something lame like that, and the second sells
all the usual alchemy supplies including the (to my cleric) all important
Cloudy Potions.

Throwing Stars, I dunno, personally I carry Blessed Water in my ammo slot,
but thats just a cleric thing.  Had to give most of my stack to my pulling monk

the other day, too, when he ran out of things to throw.  Ah well, only takes
one
item to take care of my "do not loot this till you rez yourself" slot.
