Try using /corpse - I'm not sure if the corpse summoning range is greater than
the monster's aggro range, but it might be worth a shot.  Type /corpse and it
will bring your corpse to you if you're close enough.  Use it to drag your
body to a safe spot before you grab all your stuff.

If you see a message that says "Your snare spell has worn off" then you'll
have to re-snare.  Otherwise a snared creature will not be able to run if it's
below one bubble of health or so.

Your "A giant rat has been ensnared" percentage will go up as your skill in
spellcasting increases (specifically Alteration, I think).  At level 10,
you're not going to get them every time, and the duration is pretty low.

That's another thing that will get better the more you practice at it.  What's
your Bandaging skill at right now?  I tend to use heal spells on mysellf, but
the word from a friend of mine who uses Bandaging is that when your Bandaging
skill gets up to about 30 or 40, you'll actually be able to bandage off more
than like 2 points at a time. =)

And you can only bandage yourself up to 50% health.
