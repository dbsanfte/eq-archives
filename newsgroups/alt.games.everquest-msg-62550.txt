More than likely its agp 2x, their web site probably says.

Get the shareware Powerstrip program. It tells you I think and can
actually set agp 2x if its not already set there on the fly (a
benchmark program like sisoft sandra will then verify that you
actually are at agp 2x, where as before it said one x.)

Get sisoft sandra:

It told me more about my motherboard, the size simm chips I could use,
the type -speed CLS etc of the ram I had installed, than I'd EVER have
known otherwise.
VERY imformative program and free for the shareware version since it
has some stuff disabled.

Ah, found this in a few seconds searching for your model in hotbot:

"Gateway GP7-500
purchased September 1999 - now used by Eric for gaming

Intel Pentium III ï¿½ 500MHz Processor
Intel 440BX chipset w/ 100MHz System Bus
256MB 100MHz SDRAM
Creative TNT2 Ultra 32MB AGP Graphics Card
Hitachi SuperScan Elite 751 19" Monitor
Quantum Fireball 13.6GB 7200RPM ATA-66 Hard Drive
Promise Ultra-66 ATA-66 Controller
Sony 52X CD-ROM Drive
Iomega 100MB IDE Internal ZIP Drive
Creative SoundBlaster Live! Value Sound Card
Creative Cambridge SoundWorks FPS-1000 Speakers (4 w/sub)
3Com U.S. Robotics v.90 56k Fax Modem
MS Intellimouse w/ 3M Precise Mousing Surface
Microsoft Windows 98SE"

That guys system has some added stuff though:

So, its an intel 440 bx chipset with 100mhz system bus, this is the
same type MBoard I have. So it should have 2x AGP max and the
motherboard can probably take a maximum size sim of 256 meg and as
many of them as you have simm slots is fine so the total ram limit is
768 meg, the simms are 168 pin sdram 100mhz (you can buy 133 mhz now
since that is all you'd find, they are backwards compatible so just
run at 100mhz which is fine) the default onboard graphic card  is an
ativborg (wtf is that?) with 8 meg ram, it is indeed a pentium 3 500
mhz, 

Gateway bx system board manual:

http://ie.gateway.com/esupport/manuals/desktop/systemboards/BXSystemBoard/index.htm

The power supply is only evidently 200 watts which I think might mean
you'd have some trouble possibly with some newer Geforce cards (I
think people say you should at least have a 300 watt powersupply.) The
thing is if you find one that fits, just upgrading the powersupply is
pretty cheap I think and it more or less screws in and plugs into the
MB with a simple ATX connector. I imagine a tech guy would know more
at wherever you might be able to buy just a powersupply in your area.

Not able to find anywhere if its agp 2x but I'm guessing it is.
