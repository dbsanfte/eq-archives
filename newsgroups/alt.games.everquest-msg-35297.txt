Regardless of your own views on inspecting is it that hard
to accept some people don't like it, and ask before you
inspect.  Most people will say sure.  And yes you can turn
the message off of being inspected.  That was done because
they probably can't remove the inspecting code, without
removing the code that lets you see the stats on your own
inventory items, but enough people complained about being
inspected (as well as using repeated inspections to make
someone go linkdead with the message spam) that VI did
something to appease the masses.
