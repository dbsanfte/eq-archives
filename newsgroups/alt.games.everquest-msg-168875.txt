Screw that.  LOWER THE DAMN PRICES ALREADY.  Although I admit I had no 
idea some potions did that.  Nasty.

> - Added a few more keys to the player key ring for convenience.

I was under the impression keys on key rings didn't even work properly,

> - Water needed to make a Box of Souls no longer needs to be either Sacred or
