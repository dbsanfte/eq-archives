It would be helpful if you had 512 RAM Brian - and your processor speed is
at the bottom end of what will run the game well.  I would suggest staying
out of the Luclin zones altogether until you can bump the CPU speed
some..which could result in you having to do a pretty major overhaul of your
system (motherboard and different RAM depending on the board you acquire).

I would also suggest making sure the new textures are off and as many of the
new models are turned off as well.  You'll have to have a couple on, but you
can see which ones are necessary.  If you have everything on it will eat up
system resources as will having the new textures.   Keep with the old world
style and you should be ok through Velious for the most part.  Luclin
requires a lot more power than what you currently have.

44.4 connection speed isn't a high quality connection but it should still be
do-able for you, but you may experience some big latency in some areas of
the game world and may go link dead depending on how much your system is
being taxed.

Hope that helps.
