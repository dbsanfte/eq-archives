The problem isn't the act of selling the plat; it's the process
that the plat/item seller went through to acquire his goods in the
first place.

The seller killed many mobs to get his goods, thus denying those
mobs to "legit" players.

If they're permacamping some mob that I want just to sell the loot,
then yes, I see a problem with that.
