I think the corpse summoning is a good thing. I don't think the summoned 
corpses should be rezzable. That would give us the easy recovery in an 
emergency, and still preserve the value of attempting an actual CR.

Until now (still haven't bothered with DoN), I can't take some of my 
characters to several zones because if I die I can't get my own corpse 
out. Period.

Sure I can go to PoK and beg a necro/sk to come to some out of the way 
zone to summon my corpse, but that's tedious and annoying for everyone 
involved. And I don't wish to do that.

Until DoN if I died I had to either wait for the one week timer, or beg 
a necro to come get it.

If there's a shot I can do the CR I'll attempt it, if I'm in a group and 
we can paci/fight/invis in sure, that's a challenge that I'd enjoy... 
but if I'm soloing a zerker deep in old sebilis (demonstrating that I 
really *do* enjoy a challenge) and I take a fall, a CR is outright 
suicide.
