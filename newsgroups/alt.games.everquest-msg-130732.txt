OK, so I get on EQ and get on Kayne Bayle(sp)...then it is loading graphics
and stuff, and it is clearly 60Hz. Once it gets to the character selection,
it is even worse. I popped up my monitor options, and indeed, it was 60Hz.
It is clearly running 100Hz at the first few screens, and my desktop refresh
rate and override value in DXDiag is 100Hz. How do I get EQ to use 100Hz
again?

TIA
