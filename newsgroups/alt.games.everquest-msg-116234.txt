Nah, my level 56 root is a nice low level nuke. And I usually don't
have much room to run, especially when snare and root break
simultaneously.

Not that obsessed about getting it :) 
If they really have changed the sky keys thing, I might go there more
often. As it is, I don't feel that the 3 or 4 hours I could
participate would be worth all the coffins to get me to whatever
island my guild would be on.
I'd really like to get a drakehide mask from there, too.

I want to take that ranger with me since he has experience in soloing
there and also has better tracking than me.

Really? I didn't realize that was the same thing. I think I'll make my
thread the old way first (since I have manes) and maybe try the
smithed thread if I bungle it a couple times and don't want to spend
more time farming components.

I like the name, too. I like my gear to have nifty names :)

Forking over a couple hundred plat for 5.8 mana? Not worth it.
Besides, when I get around to getting the upgrades I genuinely want,
I'll be getting rid of wis gear. (Hunting gear has me at 235, full wis
gear + pickled drake has me at 254, and I tend to stay over 200 even
when I put on resist gear.)

I'd really like a chance to replace it with Hotof's bracer, even
though that one doesn't have any mana.

Yeah, and even if it did, the clerics would be getting the sleeves
first :) (It's really unfair to make it doubly unavailable, especially
after I heard suggested that the reason it was made clr/dru/shm
instead of dru only was that people who could get it on the time had
it on all their druids already and were letting it rot...)

Yep. I just have this ingrained hatred of long boring camps that comes

Nice! Where is it from?

Really neat name, but looks like a lantern.

Oh, I know, I know. The last few months I had it, I only held it while
tradeskilling, and had a whip in my hand the rest of the time.

Oh, getting Lodi is hard enough on my server. And I'd rather sit and
camp him than camp elysians.
