Test 1:

With my baz mule in EQ I did:  /join blah
With my eq2 main I did: /join eq.zebuxoruk.blah

Test 2:
In EQ2 I created blah2
In EQ I typed:  [join eq2.kithicor.blah2

Both tests appeared to work fine, but /list (or /whochannel) lists only one 
character and chat from one game didn't appear in the other.

Is this simply something Sony hasn't gotten working yet, or am I doing it 
wrong?  I visited the forums and did not see a decisive answer.
