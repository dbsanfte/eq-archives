The grass is always greener on the other side.  For years I complained about
that snare necklace for my cleric; considered rerolling as a DE cleric to get
it.  Finally made a troll shaman to try it out, and turns out not to be much of
a much; it takes 6 seconds to cast, is a DOT as well as snare so its resisted
twice as often, the snare effect is so small that fleeing mobs often get to keep
moving, and its hard to tell some mobs that aren't injured are slowed down at
all, plus the duration is so short that fleeing mobs often get to return to
running away before dying, or you can spend 6 seconds every 18 putting snare
back up, -if- it sticks.  Nice thing is, my cleric stopped cursing about the
thing, knowing that being a dwarf isn't so bad after all, we get free beer and
the troll shamans get a POS neck that wouldnt' be worth having for fear kite
purposes.

If you do decide to go troll for the necklace, note that you have to pick
Innorruuk as a god... would be a pain to choose Cazic Thule and find out later
that the necklace is Inny only.

Yep, 20%.  They do get regen as well as the possibility of a snare neck, but if
you want regen, Iksar are cheaper.
