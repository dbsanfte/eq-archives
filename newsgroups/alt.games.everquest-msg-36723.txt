Its not being an asshole at all. What you are saying is like
in real life if a cab driver picked you up knowing that you'd
give him nothing or a penny or something. The difference is 
that the cab driver really is looking to spend his time
giving people a service and that the people who get
rides understand the concept of a taxi and that they must
pay what the meter says so no price must be arrived at
ahead of time.

Of course you are not going to respond to everyone since you'd spend
your entire problem playing only rezzing others. It works the same
way for ports. You have to have some way to seperate those who
will pay for the valuable service you can perform which comes down
to performing CUSTOMER SERVICE basically. You should never be 
expected to perform Customer Service, due to the present
design flaws in the game, and be expected to do so for everyone which
would use up all your time. I will be happy to do that if verant pays
me 15 bucks an hour to play and do so instead of me giving them 10
bucks a month.

The thing people always forget about resses, ports, heals, clarity etc
is that they are designed for that class to have value to a GROUP.
They were never intended as "services" to spend your playing time
giving out to every dang player in a 4 state radius. No one should
ever expect you to take the time unless they are making it worth the 
time you take. 


>The right thing to do is respond, "I"m a cleric, what do you need?"

Ahahaha hardly. That is like painting a target on your back and
saying, "please, beg me to death!"

There has never been a time that I was playing where I was not
"tied up with something else." The people asking for services
might THINK that perhaps a cleric, druid or enchanter is spending
the couple hours they have to play EQ just sitting on their ass
waiting for someone to want something but that is virtually
never the case. What the hell kind of game would that be? Would
such a game be worth playing? NO.

Actually its far better to not respond so that the person asking
starts to "get it." They are asking for a service that takes time, 
they often ask over and over. At some point it should dawn on 
them that they should offer something for the service which is
equal in value to what the service is WORTH to them. If they offer
nothing for  a res or a tp, my character assumes that the tp or
res is worthless to them. It is NEVER MY JOB, in any event, to be
"service coordinator" and initiate a conversation with them to arrange
prices. If they can't be bothered to say what its worth than I can't
be bothered to notice. Time is the most valuable thing in EQ of all
since every part of its design is calculated to slow you down in
whatever you attempt as much as possible. As in real life time is
money, actually time is more money in a way in EQ.

Not really. What you are talking about is more or less prostitution.
My druid or my cleric is not out soliciting clients since it is not my
job to help strangers in any event. I don't start playing with it in
mind that I am going to look for Johns to make some cash from.
I play for me and the progression of my character. THEY have to offer
something to get ME to notice them to perform CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Once again, this is some backwards ass perception that has cropped up
over time. Really if you want teleports you should group or buddy up
with a druid and if you want resses you should be grouped with a
cleric who can res. The same is true of clarity or anything else. 
If you don't want to do that then you better offer something
substantial which tells people what the service you are requesting is
worth to you in order for them to halt things in the group they likely
are in and help you, which is ALWAYS a very lucky happening for you
and should NEVER be expected.

Shadow Knights were not given corpse summoning all of a sudden to try
to make it so they could run around performing the service for what
would amount to spare change at the level in which they could but
rather so that they have more of a bonus to a group.

This totally works both ways, not only do I only agree to offers where
what is offered is worth my time but I also offer for the services
which I want in kind. After dying at level 54 and offering several
hundred plat for a 49 or up res with no result I finally offered the
only other thing of value which was still not worth as much to me as
the res. I offered a diamond and I had a res 3 seconds later. The res
was worth over the diamond to me at that point since it was a
substantial set back in playing time. Meanwhile my level 32 character
has never had a res and never offers anything for one because the set
back is so minor the res is not worth anything, she never even asks.
