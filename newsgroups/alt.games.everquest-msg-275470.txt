Wait.

Seriously, it increases over time, whether you are logged in or not.  So, 
in order to increase tradeskill vitality, spend time on alts, or spend 
time adventuring.  In order to increase adventure vitality, spend time 
tradeskilling, or on alts.  Alternatively, spend time playing other 
games.

Currently, I have never seen my vitality lower than going into the next 
level on either tradeskills or adventuring, except for the new character 
I made, where I did run out of adventuring vitality quickly, did not play 
that character for a few days, and have since, not seen it below going 
into the next level.
