Keep in mind that EQ2 was designed to scale graphically several years into 
the future - not even the most high end gaming system can currently handle 
everything turned up to full.

I'm on a P4 3.4 Ghz with 1 gig of RAM, and I find myself turning complex 
shaders off if I'm in a group or a high lag area.  Go to options --> 
performance --> and set complex shader distance to -1.  That gets rid of all 
lag for me.  If you're taking screenshots or want to bask in the sexy glowy 
armour, turn it back up to 8-11 or so.

Otherwise just tweak around and find out what works best.... if specular 
lighting is on, that takes alot of memory... lower the amount of high detail 
characters perhaps... one thing I don't recommend is turning the texture 
detail down - it makes everything look blocky and pixely.
