Thanks to Ubi Soft in Denmark that recieved to few copies i will not 
be able to play with SOL until tuesday the 11th, big thanks to them :(

Besides so far the game is okey, my wizard bolt spells is not
function, the necro pet and necro in lich form makes people laugh :(
some bad slowdowns when accessing spellbook the first times, for me
the entire screen goes black for 1 - 2 seconds when i hit CTRL B :(

Love the wolfs though, they shure look great, and they run very nice
to, skeletons became better after the slowdown but they still look
more silly than scary, hope they fix the fight animation to, and the
lifetap bug in the high level pet, only been there for ages but not
important it seems :(

Think it will be nice when i finally get that expansion, will go to
the moon and buy spells, well 1 anyway the lvl 12 wizard DS, the lvl
20 DD i can't afford :(

/Regards Berth
