Oh, you just reminded me of another important bit! Be prepared to duck a lot, as
a number of the doorways can't be walked through standing upright. And there's
one guard you will grow to hate. Guard Bolton. His path, for some cruel reason,
often has him standing right in the fucking doorway where you head down from the
smithing merchants to the bank, and he can stay there for a maddeningly long
time. Quite often, while either trying to get down there upon arriving, or
trying to get out when leaving, I've had to have groupmates either train a
pickclaw past him to get him to move for me, or SoW and pop an arrow in him and
run to zone so you can pass. Your shrink spell will *not* work in here because
it's an outdoor zone, even though it looks like a frigging dungeon to me. Worst
cast is when that happens when you get swarmed and everyone yells to run to
zone. Your smaller groupmates will scurry right past him while you remain
blocked there while the mobs catch up. Then the bastard will often just turn
around and start hacking at the gobs, still blocking the doorway, while they
beat you to death. Most unpleasant, so keep an eye on Bolton and where he
stations himself.
