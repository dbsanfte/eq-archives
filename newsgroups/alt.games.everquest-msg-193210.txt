I'm in the same situation with my tailor/druid. I've been going between
making Wyvern hide, cultural (Halfling), and Solstice Robes.

The Solstice robes are the easiest to get stuff for, but more expensive. I
have a GM jewelcrafter for the Gem Studded Chains and a 29 wood elf druid
mule for the Embued Emeralds. I can hunt up stacks of silk myself, but even
buying at 5p each is the cheepest part.

I love fishing, and Cobalt Scar is my favorite fishing spot, so Cod Oil is
not a problem. (Save the Dragon Bay Snapper for snapper oil. It's a great
way to raise brewing up to 150.) I have stacks of Wyvern hides and Cod oil.
Farming the Velium is what holdes up this process for me. If you are on the
Mith. Marr server, I would be glad to trade you Cod Oil for Velium Studs :)

Cultural would be the easiest for me except for the extreme shortage of HQ
Brute hides in the Bazaar lately, and I'm not going to try to farm them
anymore. Took over a week of constant green killing to get a stack. The
Brute zones are so remote and the HQ hides just don't drop.

Oh well, just rambling here I guess. A tailors life is not easy...

Best of luck,
Naphtoe
