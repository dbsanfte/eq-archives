*Please* let this say something like "you have looted a XX from a YY".
It would make log-parsing in order to calculate loot drops and
odds for different mobs a reality.

That could partially be done even if the message just said what
was looted, but not from what mob, but picking up stuff after
a multi-mob battle, or looting a corpse you come across as you
travel, would make it hard to properly assign loot to mob type.

It'd be nice if the "party loot" notification also mentioned the
mob.
