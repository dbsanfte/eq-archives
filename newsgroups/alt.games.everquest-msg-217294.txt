And every time i use my cure curse I thank my absolutely wonderful game 
husband for getting it as a drop for me......

i almost always have it loaded up when i log out so when i pop into the 
game i have it ready [i am bound in LFAY and camp in and out in BB] in 
case someone needs a quick curse handled. What i really need to do now 
is actually do the quest for the second LOY quest spell that combines 
poison and disease cure...it just seems like something always comes up 
when I decide to go and finish it..
aru
actually , he got a serious percentage of my 52-65 spells for me as 
drops over the past 6 months or so...i got me a keeper when i said yes 
to his proposal=)
