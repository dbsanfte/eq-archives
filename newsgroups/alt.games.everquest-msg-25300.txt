I started my druid epic at level 33, at the moment i have done all up to
the reaver in EK.
Have also gotten the 4 forages, and the item from the Corrupted Mammoth in
Everfrost.
All that can be done by a level 33 druid. If i get a few friends to kill
the Reaver in EK for me, i should be able to do all up to VS in Karnors,
then have to wait till levle 50+ to get down there.
