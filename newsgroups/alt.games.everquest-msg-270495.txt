Why people care about how other people play their toons is beyond me. As 
has been pointed out, there will always be incompetent players for a 
wide variety of reasons. I was in an LDoN with a 65 chanter the other 
night who didn't seem to have ever lulled targets for the puller. Now 
imagine that. I had to laugh. Look at it this way, these folks cause you 
to have to use new strategies and really test your skills in attempting 
to survive and actually win an encounter. This chanter learned something 
new that night and was doing fine with it after the warrior taught him 
that little piece of how to play his class. lol

It's times like this that it is particularly gratifying to be a cleric. 
I don't worry too much about healing folks who get themselves into 
trouble through obvious and complete incompetence because they need to 
learn the consequences of failing to play their class effectively. I 
worry about the assets to the group who will ulimately overcome 
obstacles despite the anchors they are dragging along with them. You can 
find some fun and humor in just about any situation if you try.
