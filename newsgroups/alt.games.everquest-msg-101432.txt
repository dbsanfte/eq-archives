Yup. I'm the archetypal bad workman.  I was gazing in open mouthed
admiration at the wallpaper that Dee posted in the binaries group (love
it BTW Dee!), and was just sitting there thinking how the hell could I
ever be that good?

 You've made a good point. I don't usually tend to spend much time using
paint programs and whatnot, as I want to achieve results like yesterday
(and normally end up wildly frustrated!), whereas in reality I really
need to sit down and get to grips with my tools (oo-er). I think I'm
going to go off and search for X-Mozilla-Status: 0009nks!
