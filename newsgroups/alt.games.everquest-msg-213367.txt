Boats in Dulak - The hardest is Windscorn (mobs 45-50+),
next is oceancrasher (mobs into the high 40's) then the
others get easier.  They drop several pp each, and often
drop gems (including diamonds, blue diamonds and the
like).  While PL'ing my enchanter through his high 40's
I used to get 300-450pp an hour by just clearing Oceancrasher.

Nadox used to provide me with some cash, but the market
got flooded with Coral rings and the like.  Early on
they went for 5k a piece on Lanys.
