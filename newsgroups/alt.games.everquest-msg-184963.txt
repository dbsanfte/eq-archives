Barring pre-manaburn wizards, what's the bare minimum of people to kill
a Kunark dragon these days???

Five folks from my guild killed Talendor last night. Warrior, druid,
shammy, chanter, monk. All level 63 to 65 in less than Emp gear. Took a
while, but he went down.

My, how the world has changed! :-).
