It is truly pathetic how uncaring they are about their customers.   Its 
like they want the game to die.

Not just those.  My credit card information did NOT change, and indeed
I had added DoDH and PoR to both my accounts (using the existing credit
card info) just days before they closed the accounts when the one-year
subs ran out.  I reopened them using 6-month subs, and have complained
several times, but they haven't fixed them yet.  My last post to their
support folks yielded the ever-so-helpful response "your information has
