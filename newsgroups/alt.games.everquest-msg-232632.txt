Oh, I saw what you saw, I just did not understand what the problem is, 
they stated exactly what was happenning.  Likely the reason for it was 
that a similar issue came up with Vah Shir and Beastlords when Luclin was 
released and the fungi tunic.

The issue, as someone else already stated, is that they will likely be 
tweaking which items end up being usable by the new class, and they are 
warning people not to depend on what shows as berzerker usable now.
