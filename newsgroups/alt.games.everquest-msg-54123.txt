 lol. Allow me to put my jerk hat on and say : Whaaa.

 If you don't like it, use /feedback. If they don't change it then
that's just the way it goes so get used to it.

 I understand your concept, I just don't agree with it. The way the game
is currently designed is that if you don't like people inspecting you,
turn off the message and you wont know they are. If you leave it on that
simply means you're looking for something to whine about.
