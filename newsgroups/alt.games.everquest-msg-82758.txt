If you can re-invis yourself, why bother running at all?

Warriors, Clerics and Paladins (and beastlords?) don't have that option.

Doesn't bother me.  I could solo anything near the portal short of a train of
elites.  And I have run speed 2 (soon 3!) to get away from anything I can't
solo.   But I can see where it would be a pretty big issue to the level 30 -
40 warrior trying to leave Velious.
