I don't have to read the book...Columbo read it to me and the
kid from Wonder Years together...:-)

I've thought the exact same thing...plus the fact that the people
playing their parts _really_ fit the casting.  Andre the Giant, Mandy
Patenkin (sp? Hell, it doesn't matter...he'll always be Inego...),
and even the lil' sicilian guy...great casting.  A movie you can
watch _and enjoy_ with your grandmother in the room is pretty
rare these days.
