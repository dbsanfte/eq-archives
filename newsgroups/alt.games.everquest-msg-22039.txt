jesus!  Its the "anal" ones that make the game fun for me.  I personally
don't care for loot, but arguments about whose looting what can usually
bring a decently good group down.  Its a rare thing to have a group leader
who would take the responsibility to call loot order and do it fairly.  If
you don't care who loots, fine, but I think you're out of line calling Mike
anal.  Mike should be commended for trying to do his job (which he
apparently volunteers to his groups) better.
