Many of those who came from EQ to DAoC had already stopped playing EQ
anyways. The vast majority of the rest never cancelled their EQ
accounts even while playing DAoC. And of those a large number left
DAoC after their free month was done and returned to EQ.

If you don't believe me, check the number of people playing EQ at the
Sony site. The number in the top right is people playing all their
games, but if you're not interested in subtracting all the people
playing the board games etc as a general rule 90-95% of those people
are playing EQ at any given time. That sets EQ's peak prime time
number at around 100k in general, waffling around a bit.

EQ is still at its record highs set from BEFORE DAoC came out every
night. Nope, DAoC didn't hurt EQ at all.

As much as DAoC's fanboys would like to believe that did....
