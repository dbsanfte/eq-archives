If you have Luclin (I'm assuming you do) then you could make your way to
Shar Vahl. There's a warrior guild there where you can train. Then do the
Luclin circuit:


Shadeweaver's Thicket
Paludal Caverns
Netherbian Lair
Marus Seru
Dawnshroud Peaks
Echo Caverns

That should take you to at least the mid 40's or 50's with no worries about
faction at all.
