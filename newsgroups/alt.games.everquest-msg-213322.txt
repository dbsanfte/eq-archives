------------------------------

- Two Bastion of Thunder keys and one key in the Plane of Air
that were supposed to open up a location for your entire group
were only taking the key holder.  We have fixed that problem.
Also, the Enchanted Ring of Torden will now attach to your key
ring the next time you use it.

- The "base" population in the Tower of Solusek Ro now has the
ability to summon.  Please be aware of this the next time you
enter the tower of the god of flame.

- We have corrected a pathing issue in South Karana that was
causing the NPCs to all travel to the same point.

- Cloth caps will no longer drop off NPCs in Siren's Grotto.

- We have reduced the number of characters in a raid required to
access the Plane of Time from 40 to 18.

- The Burrower has been modified back to its original difficulty.

- A tether has been added to Fennin Ro.
