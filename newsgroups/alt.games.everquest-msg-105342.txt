Perhaps it does, perhaps it doesn't.  Absolutely *nothing* in your little
"test" furthers the hypothesis one way or the other.  I can read it again... 
your test will still be fundamentally flawed for the conclusion you are

Levels > gear

No qualifiers.  You're trying to fit my words into claiming that gear has no
impact, which is ludicrous.  I do not fall into such strawman traps.
