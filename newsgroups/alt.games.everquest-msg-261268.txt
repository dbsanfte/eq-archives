I know I'm missing something...

I talk to the guy.  He casts.  About 20 seconds later I am in OoW.  I never
see the white swirl/vision...  I *want* to see this, at least once.  I went
so far as to turn on everything and turn everything up to high (and what I
think is the least "clipped", though the interface to set clipping is a
little bizarre).  Maybe I just need to look down, this is the first time
I've heard it referenced as being on the ground.
