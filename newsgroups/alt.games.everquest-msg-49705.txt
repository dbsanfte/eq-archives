The world as a whole is identical on each server, in terms of what
mobs, quests, locations etc exist.

You create a character on a specific server, if you want to play him
you need to log onto that server, he is not movable (without certain
herculean efforts involving shelling out real life cash and getting him
stripped of all posessions)

By and large, what changes from server to server are the people.
The difference between EQ and most other computer "role playing"
games is that this is "massively multiplayer"  There are literally
a couple thousand people playing characters on each server.
While it is possible to play EQ and never interact with any of them,
that interaction is the heart and soul of the game.  You can "group"
with up to five others and share the work and rewards of killing
the bad guys.  You can buy, sell, beg, give, help, irritate, and
otherwise interact with everyone else in your current "zone",
and give direct tells to converse with anyone else on the server
(each server is divided into a large number of "zones" which
is to say slices of geography.)

There are three principal types of server.  Most are standard
"blue" servers, where you are unable to attack fellow players
unless both have agreed to a duel (there are a few exceptions
to this), some (names ending in Zek, and clearly marked
on server select) are "red" which means that players can be
attacked without warning or agreement (other than that
they created characters on the Zek server in the first place)
and there is now a third type, "roleplaying preferred", which
has some funny rules changes that the people running the
game are experimenting with.
