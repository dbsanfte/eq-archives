I play a halfling. I want to grandmaster tailoring, but I never see
Stormreapers armor sold in the bazaar and misty acorns seem very rare.

Since tailoring is a pain and a half to grandmaster, is it worth it? There
is no profit in acrylia armor and barely one in ceremonial robes anymore.

I could try to grandmaster smithing. Would it repay the cost of learning it?
I can get to 162 cheaply by making Vale sewing kits.

I know that baking and brewing don't make money. Misty Thicket picnics are
very cheap now and can be made without grandmaster level skill anyway. I
make a few pp from Lucky Cabbages.

That leaves pottery, but I'm not keen on it. Mybe with those focus IV items
I hear about?

So is Stormrepers armor sought by anybody? Is tradskilling worth it for a
halfling?
