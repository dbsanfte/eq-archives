I'm getting tired of Dulak, tired of running thru the tunnel and having 
invis break on my way there and on my way back, tired of being in the 
same zone so often... plus the scouts have almost all turned cyan but 
still aggro, so I no longer have a decent kiting area unless I spend the 
time and energy to kill cyan mobs to keep it clear.

I'm looking, ideally, for a spot where I can solo, but can add friends 
as they come online.

One spot that works fairly well is POJ exit; I can, with care, get 
singles which I can kill on a full HP bar, and can with a larger group 
kill reasonably fast without surpassing the spawn rate.  Trouble is, 
many of my friends are under 46 still, so they can't come in and play.

Tried COM at 49, half the mobs are cyan there too, and they are hard to 
single pull for someone with no tools for doing so, plus its a long run 
from POK

Haven't done Karnors, but its possible I've had enough KC on other 
characters to serve me for a lifetime.

There are many LOY zones I've never been to, but all of them share 
access thru the Gunthak Tunnel, so I still have to cope with needing a 
SOW and an Invis to hope not to hit people with a massive train... and 
then wishing I had lev as I make the same run backwards but end up 
trying to outswim the horde on my tail.  Annoys me how much simpler this 
problem is for most classes with a mana bar (exceptions would be... only 
cleric and paladin?)
