Tell ya what, jack, you can criticize how much and how long teachers
work when you actually become or live with one.  Then you'll see the
12-16 hour days, the fact that during "vacation" you are still
working, and the VERY high level of stress that comes from being
expected to not only teach the little heathens, but to act as some
sort of goddamned replacement parent too (cause the good lord knows
most of the parents aren't doing the job!).  Those men and women earn
every penny they make, believe me.  I married a teacher, I get to see
the amount of work from the inside.  You counldn't pay me enough to
take that job.

So, next time you care to insult an entire segment of society, why
don't you learn what the hell you're talking about before you begin to
type.
