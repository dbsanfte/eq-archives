So long as Rage isn't up (and if he is, wait 20 minutes and he's down with a
bottom-feeding uberguild dividing up his drops among their twinks), you're
talking about bard heaven.  Oh, sure, the Ancient Wurms summon, but they're
the only ones - so don't mess with 'em, run around them.  It's usually open
enough that you can get a good group together without going near any groups.
And if you like, I can show you a neat area along the wall near wizard
port-in where there are no roamers, good for those last few kills when you
don't want any adds.
