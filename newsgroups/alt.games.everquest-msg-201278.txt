I would start with what ever "basic pacage" you can find the cheapest. 
These are called things like everquest gold etc.
If you do like the game after a week or 2 then I would definatly 
recommend getting the PoP expansion. Infact if you are going to end up 
playing for more than 5 hrs a week it is probably worth geting all the 
expansions.

Your other option is to wait for EQ2 (which will be a totally different 
game. (And thus all new) I think this is planned for 4th quarter (i.e. 
christmas)

The other thing that you want to do before you buy either is check that 
your computer will run the game. Make sure you have at least the minimum 
spec and preferably lots more (Priority order : GFX card, Memory, 
Internetconnection, Processor (IMOSHO))

Finally don't worry about being "behind" 90% of the players are behind 
and I would guess that 50% of the active players never get on a raid of 
any sort.

HTH
