I get close to as much out of a bandage as I get out of my current healing
spell. So eventually yes it becomes very very useful if you not a decent
healing class (ie Cleric, Druid, Shammy at a pinch Paladion as well)

However for untwinked you have hit the nail on the head - the cost...

The way round that is to hunt lots of the right spider type and use the
silks they drop to make bandages - thus increasing your tailoring skills,
and giving bandages. Also hunting a stack of silk of various sorts should
generate enough income to pay for a lot of bandages if you are prepared to
wait around selling (and with the current economy my in fact be the better
way to go)
