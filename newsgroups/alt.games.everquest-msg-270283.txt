For gear advice it may be an idea to post a magelo (www.magelo.com) , but
yep, I think you need more HP :)  I play a ranger, who have sucky hp, my
gear is nothing that special and max at about 6.7ish khp (4.6kish  hp /
1.2ish k ac unbuff)I am level 67 though.  I think you may find it hard to
tank past tier 3 (ie BoT / HoH) in that current gear, but seeing as they are
62 or flagged zones, that is irrelavant for now. You should be ok in PoV /
other tier 2 zones with a decent slower (shaman can heal in pov from around
58-60+, cleric from 55+, druid 58+ (I think) ).

I am no expert on pala gear, and dont know the class that well, and without
a magelo it makes it harder to give advice (at least for me, not knowing the
class).

Getting to 62 then trying for some ornate drops should boost your HP, it can
take a while, but in my experience, plate molds are one of the more common
drops.  60-61 is a non level, takes no time, 61-62 is a little longer,
getting some defensive aa's at 62 may be worth it, but someone who plays a
tank should be able to advise you better.  Personally I am now of the
philosphy that levels > all, but thats mainly because I hate grinding levels
as opposed to AA, and like getting em out the way, so to speak.

LDoN has already been mentioned, check out the various camps and get ya
points there if you choose that route, I have lost the link (re-format) but
there used to be a decent ldon gear finder, google should find it if
somebody doesnt post it here first.

As a side note, I am returning after a 3 month break, so some of this info
is probably a little out of date. Check the bazaar for cheap +hp / ac gear,
I have seen some nice bits from OoW for quite cheap there recentley.
