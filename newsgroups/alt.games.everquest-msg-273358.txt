What annoys me is how many quests or zones become inaccessible as you level,
and how small the level range between party members must be. On solution is
to turn off xp but that seems insane... Conan the barbarian learnt languages
by *learning*, not by refusing to learn how to fight better! Yet there's a
gnoll language quest that becomes impossible if i level, so unless they put
in another way (and so far they haven't been flexible) then you can't do
something that is just fun. I guess you are just supposed to level and
collect shiny trinkets, that are later exchanged for other shinies so that
you can level, etc etc.

IMHO quests are fun, grinding is a process of tedium endured in the hope
that it will somehow turn out to be fun later, perhaps when you show off
your shinies to the other grinders.

I keep coming across things that seem to reinforce negative things people
have attributed to SOE's attitude to soloing, like the guide to grouping
they linked to which saw grouping and doing quests as an abberation, and the
"grouping to grind the same monsters until they grey out, then moving
slightly and repeating" as the norm.

I never see groups in the seas around antonica, instead they always seem to
be trying for gnolls then scarecrows then AC quests then moving on to
thundering steppes. I've gotten a few groups in down below, but vermin's
snye and stormhold keep never seems popular (possibly because only outdoor
zones are mappable?) and soloing their doesn't work well from what i have
seen.

It's a shame, eq2 has excellent points, the voice work is a scream and the
animations gorgeous, the artwork lovely and the sense of vastness very
enthralling, but eq2 seems to be shooting itself in the foot by not allowing
easy quest sharing, anti-camping code (simply make killing the same mob give
less xp each time and the seas would fill with adventurers fast!), and more
scope for the soloer.

Nobody ever wrote stories about the daring adventurer Throg and his band,
who stood in the same place for days and bashed, until they moved to a
slightly different location, and resumed bashing. Playing online should be a
chance to write your own story! That's adventure...
