ok, so.. I only read the first 2 lines of your post.. ill just assume the
rest of goes on to indulge in a bit of the swearing, and calling everyone
who disagrees with you an idiot.

There *IS* a reason to bolt for the camp. targeting the magus and tapping
enter on your already typed out 'nedaria' will zap you out of harms way.
Popular opinion is that since its your train you should sit and die.. well
when he zoned ..it became YOUR train so by all means. die.


And besides, you guys REALLY ought to know better by now than to enter a
high level zone without invis. be it a spell or a potion and a click item.
invis is available to everyone.
