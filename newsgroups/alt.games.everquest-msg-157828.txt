I was hoping to improve my wolves of the north faction, and despite a week
spent killing giz dinree, i'm still scowling (iksar are so misunderstood!)
I'm lv 51 monk and was hoping to find some way to kill something so that i
can get to dubious, whereupon the gnoll fang quest would solve most other
halas problems (except for being kos where the bank is, with no known way to
escape).

I wanted to kill ice giants but was being harassed by this guy and his pet
bear. I thought about killing dark elf rogues; they seem weak if they can be
single pulled; but the thought of going deep into neriak is pretty scary to
say the least.

Also eqcaster reckons i should try out the Cavern Lotus in Fungus Grove (i 2
box with 51 druid) and i am a bit apprehensive as everyone seems to think
it's occupied by lv 60's and huge trains (eek!), and level 51 seems to be
far weaker than i always imagined it would be ... anyone else hunting there
around my level on rodcet nife? I wouldn't mind grouping there to learn the
ropes.
