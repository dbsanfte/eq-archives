Ah, finally!  I was intending to ask what "swimming in a corner"
was about.  (I thought maybe it had to do with kids swimming in
the adult section of the pool. :-)  I admit I never thought of
this trick for boosting my swimming skill.  Not realising that it
would count toward swimming skill-ups, what I've usually done to
practice swimming is to dive in, turn on autorun, and then sit
with one of the turn buttons held down so I swim in a tight circle
while I read something on Allakhazam or have a bite to eat or
whatever.  Is that "against the rules?"  What if I use a book to
hold down the turn button so I don't have to sit there?

Frankly, I'm not sure what's wrong with "buff bots", especially if
they work for free (accepting optional donations).  I guess there's
some hard-to-pin-down effect in that they discourage players from
interacting with other live players.  I admit that I enjoy it when
I'm passing through PoK and someone buffs me up, often without me
even asking for it.  I always say something to thank them (usually
in character), and offer a donation suitable to my level (which is
often declined).  The interactions are fun, and are part of the
game.  Frankly, if there were buff bots on my EMarr, I'd probably
still see if anyone live was offering buffs instead, because I do
like it better that way.  But I don't see how the bots spoil the
game, unlike (say) an infusion of platinum from farm bots.
