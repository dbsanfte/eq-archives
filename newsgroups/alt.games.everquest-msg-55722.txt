even a few steps outside melee distance it often took a few seconds for
the animation to show that the mob was attacking.  Since I was a druid
for most of the events, I would cast snare if I didn't see any fighting
animation.  sometimes that alone was enough for it's health bar to catch
up to where it should be and I would move on, it's snared no harm no
foul and often a help to others, as most of the undead would run when
low on life.  Maybe you have some connection better than a T3, but I for
one use a cable modem, and often the health bar is not an indicator when
there's 200 people in a zone, as it doesn't always display where it
should.  Yes there were KS pricks at the event, you find them scattered
lightly throughout the game at all levels.  However most of the KS was
unintentional.
