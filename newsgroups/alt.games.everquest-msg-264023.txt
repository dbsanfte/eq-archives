For me it wasn't.  I started with M59 and got a lot of "gosh wow!" out if
it.  Later I started into EQ, and I got another full dose of "gosh wow!".  I
got yet another dose when I started SWG.  Problem there was that after the
"gosh wow!" there was nothing behind it.

EQ2 doesn't seem to have the same "gosh wow!" that the others gave, but I
think that's because it *isn't new*.  I've been to Norrath before.

Yes, there are lots of new things, yes the method of doing everything is
different, yes the entire world's changed, but in some ways it hasn't.  I
grew up in Qeynos 3 times before.  I'm growing up in Qeynos again.  Sure,
it's a different Qeynos, but I know there'll be gnolls out there, I know
I'll be beating rats and other yard trash to death.  Sure, Lt. Arathur's had
a sex change, but, s/he's still there.  Smedley's wrong about it being a
whole new game.

Frankly, I think they'd have been better off renaming everything and *not*
calling it EQ2.

Of course, the excessive hand-holding is also a major annoyance.  I *want*
to make fatal mistakes.  I *want* to make a major boo-boo and have to run
like a bunny.  Some of my most exciting times were the trains in Blackburrow
and Unrest.  I mean, Unrest trains were *great*!  You could sit there off
the tracks and watch them go steaming by, then come chugging back
afterwards.  As long as you didn't go ask for trouble, it wasn't all that
dangerous.

Also, some of the new names they're using tend to jar a little bit.  Walking
through the dwarven/barbarian starting area of Qeynos, I found a pig named
Gullenbursti!  First thing I wondered was, where's the Thunderer?  Been a
*long* time since Reyder's dropped a sacrifice off at one of His shrines.
Shortly thereafter I found a cat named Freya and a dog named Fenris.  I'm
going to have to head down into the sewers, see if they've got a serpent
down there named Jormungandr.  Makes me wonder if a bunch of new gods are
going to be moving in.  Wouldn't that be interesting?

By the way, if so, I call dibs on being the first of Tyr's Paladins.
