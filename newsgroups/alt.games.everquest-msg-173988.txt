I had fun with that in guild chat the other day *g*  The victim being a 
cleric in his 30s, poor thing.

You say to your guild, 'everybody has these great kick-ass "oh let me 
log in so and so" chars'
You say to your guild, 'I have a rogue and a necro.'
Katsu tells the guild, 'lol'
You say to your guild, 'woo hoo. ;p'
You say to your guild, '"here, I can buff you!  With one level 9 buff. 
*cough*"'
Katsu tells the guild, 'hold on eiri lemme log on to my...'
Katsu tells the guild, '=P'
You say to your guild, ':p'
Katsu tells the guild, 'i wana rogue buffs'
Daedek tells the guild, 'rogues give buffs?'
Updown tells the guild, 'nope'
You say to your guild, 'yes we do Daedek'
You say to your guild, 'but because they're so overpowered, we keep it 
quiet'
Updown tells the guild, 'lol :P'
Daedek tells the guild, 'what do you guys do then?'
Updown tells the guild, 'rogues indirectly give debuffs..'
You say to your guild, 'we've got this buff that's like aego + KEI, plus 
it makes you invincible for 30 hours.'
Daedek tells the guild, 'yeah right'
You say to your guild, 'and it only costs 1 mana to cast, and the 
component is a chunk of meat.'
