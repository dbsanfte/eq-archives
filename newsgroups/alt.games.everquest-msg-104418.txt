Incorrect.  They will summon/drag your corpse somewhere safe, CS rez
it and port you to safety once you have looted (actually summon via
another Guide) if the server has to come down for an emergency patch
making normal CR impossible or very difficult.

This happened twice in a row to our recent Hate raids, server had to
come down VERY suddenly to fix patch fubars, came down too fast to get
everyone out.

Expect to have to spend some time waiting for your petition to be
answered and for stringent checks on the circumstances to be made
however.
