DoT do not get partial hits, although, if a mob is moving TOWARDS you
for an apprecable amount of time while DoT'ed, the DoT will hit for
1/3 less damage.  This is why Snare/Root/DoT is the best way to go.

And while I can't speak for the lower level roots, Verant didn't fix
root until I was well into my 30's, the upper level roots kick mucho
ass.  My 49 root almost always sticks for full duration.
