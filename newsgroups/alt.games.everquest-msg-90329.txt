I'd go:

Nexus -> Shadowhaven -> Echo Caverns -> Fungus Grove ->
Twilight Sea -> Katta Castellum.

Notes:

1.  Echo Caverns:  Use your invis song and you'll be fine,
but WALK WIDE AROUND the waving "tentacle plants" stuck
to the walls and ceilings.  They operate by touch, not
sight, and if you brush against one of the tentacles,
you'll be in big trouble.  But they're easy to walk around
if you just use your head.

2.  Fungus Grove:  Yes, it's a 50+ zone, but again, you
can use your invis song.  It's actually not that hard
to just walk through unmolested at low level, as long
as you look sharp.  The "cavemen" will be non-KoS to
you unless you've killed them a lot, and so will the
bugs (both types).  If you don't walk into the wrong
places, the only dangers will be the stationary lotus
plants (just don't walk near them) and the mushrooms
(their camps are *really* hard to miss) -- and I'm not
sure if they see through invis anyway.  Fungus Grove
has a lot of wide-open spaces and no real wanderers, 
even a level 1 could walk through visible if he was
careful and didn't get run over by a train.

Fungus Grove is the "tamest" 50+ zone I've ever seen,
I've nicknamed it the "50+ newbie zone".

3.  Twilight Sea:  It's easy to avoid killer stuff here,
just swim between the islands.  And again, there's
that invis song...

4.  Heck, the biggest danger of the whole trip will
probably be falling off the ramp leading up to the
upper part of Katta (where the Bard's guild is) from
the lower part (which you'll be in after zoning in from
Twilight Sea).  It's twisty, and has no guardrails.
And levitate doesn't work in Katta.
