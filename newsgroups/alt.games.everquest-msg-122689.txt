Of all of the changes/services that have come down the pike, only the
removal of Hell levels was billed as "impossible" to my recollection.
The rest were most likely used to squelch arguments at the time. I
remember it to more like "Not possible to do, or not possible to
program at this time", with a dash of "We will never do it, because it
is not part of the Vision(tm)".

>So instead of simply being impossible, they LIED.

At the time it may have been the truth. Over the past three years a
lot of changes have been made the the EQ code base, and I am sure new
programmers have been brought on board. What was "impossible" 2 years
ago could be possible today. It doesn't all have to be lies. 

On the other hand....Sometimes a lie is the best way to stop an
argument. 

I'm not defending VI. I am just expressing a different point of view.

Well you just likened VI to bankers that forclose on people in
financial trouble. You don't have to pay for the "extra" services VI
is now offering. Their "greed" only affects you, if you use the
services.

It's business, they are greedy, and EQ is still the best game of it's
type on the market.

I think the posts were meant as a joke as well. I bet if you ask
anyone who has Grandmastered a tradeskill, they might have paid to
save themselves the time and frustration.

/agree

On the otherhand, I bet there would still be tens of thousands of
players lining up to pay cash for rewards.

Moot then. I misunderstood you.

Come on BIZ, you should know by now that you are NOT a typical EQ
player. You are your own special breed, and you walk to the beat of a
different drum. :-)
