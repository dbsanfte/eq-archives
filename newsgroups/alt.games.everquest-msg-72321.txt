I've LSoEE, it's 16/29, 5 magic damage.  From my parsing, on not not
particularly resistant mobs in Maiden's and Seb, about 50% of the time it's
a 16 damage weapon.  The rest of the time it's spread just about evenly
from 17 to 21.  It definately does more damage than a regaulr 16/29, but
it's nowhere near what a 21/29 would crank out.

It's still gross though, I hope they nerf the quest and not the weapon...
