Run 1:Start running. Stunned.  Take some damage.  Run more.  Free of
mobs.  Keep running, zone.

Run zero: Start running.  Stunned. Take some damage.  Run more.  Still taking
damage.  Still damage.  Slowing down due to damage.  Dead.

Which is better?

Yes, Run 2 is better than one, easier to get to "free of mobs"

Yes, Run 3 is better still same reason.

But Run zero means there will be no escape unless you happen
to have a clear path you can manage a jumping hopping diagonal
slide down.

The difference between run 1 and run zero is so vast that I'd reccomend
dropping leveling to get it. The difference between run 1 and run 3 is small
enough that for a non-puller, I'd go with levelling up, unless there is
an archetype skill on your "need" list.

When you ARE getting general AA skills I'd certainly go run 1, 2, 3
over all else regardless of class.
