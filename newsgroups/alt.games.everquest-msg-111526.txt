never said I was trying to win, just saying it would be really cool to

this is where I disagree, a "sequel" that forces the death of the
orginal is not too cool, small point maybe no ones cares but that is not

and you have to understand your customer base, I am pointing out where I

but you are not flaming right?

funny how that works, you are proving the "debate" you want, ignore my

debate, just argument.
