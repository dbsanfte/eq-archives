  I'm not familiar with all of the quests in there, but the
Rallik pack quest guy is definately not on VC faction.
I had been hoping to do that quest many months ago with
my ogre, since he had looted a runner pouch.  Getting VC
faction up is a snap by farming the Seru Hands that hang around
the zonelines in Marus Seru - only took me a weekend to get to
amiable.  Too bad Rallik was still scowling at me...

  Raising the Citizens faction is more problematic.  The only
boosts I've gotten from killing something was when I managed
to bag one of the lower level Hands inside the city of Sanctus Seru.
Unfortunately every other time I've tried killing in there I got my
ass kicked.  I regularly see a group of 2-3 high levels (near 60'ish)
killing guards at the zone in, so if you're high enough level and
got a few buddies to help, you can give it a go.

  You can also raise Citizens faction through some quests in there..
turning in 4 vampyre ashes/blood vials, or there's a guard captain
in there that gives you a box to fill with 8 shrieking substance (I
shudder when I think of how many substance I wasted when I
could use them now that I'm into high level smithing!).  I did all of
these quests many times, and Rallik and that assling in the garden still
scowl at me, so I finally gave up.

  Good luck!  I hope someone else responds with better advice
to get that faction up.  I've already decked out my characters with
rallik packs using an alt, but I'd still hate to see that runner's pouch
in my ogre's bank box go to waste....
