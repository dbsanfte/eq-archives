Working on an ISP techline I have actually recommended to someone they
migrate to AOL. They were godhuggers who rang up spouting crap about how
they were going to sue our asses off because they were receiving sexually
explicit email... shock horror.

I patiently explained to them as simply as possible what "the internet"
actually is, and hence the fact that "the internet" is proberly not what
they wanted in the first place, so why not try something like AOL?

Of course such a simple fix was not to be, they just wanted to complain and
not fix anything. Interestingly enough, when I finally convinced them to get
in front of their PC (they mentioned a high phone bill a bit later on) I
found in dial up networking a custom dialler for one of those direct dial
overseas porn companies...

Needless to say I took great delight in explaining those things don't
accidently or maliciously install themselves "so they may need to keep
closer tabs on who accesses their computer...*coughs*". And yes - I did
actually cough.
