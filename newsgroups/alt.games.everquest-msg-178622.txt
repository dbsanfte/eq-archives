Can't turn in quest items while invis.  Wolf form may work if he can
find a druid to help.  High level enchanter may be able to help with
illusion Halfling.

Turning in bandages to an npc in Misty Thicket helps a number of
Halfling factions.  I don't recall the name of the npc and again he
might need illusion Halfling.
