Never really liked the Guk, I think I will go with the Spectres camp
that was mentioned in another posting.

This sounds like a good place. Will try them when I get closer to 40.

Guess key word is competent, I really hate to go oom just because 2
ppl pull same time, some are afk while fights, and other doesnt have a
clue how their class works ;-) I know my cleric works best in a
(competent) group. But sometimes I just want to log on this alt and
start fighting, medding while doing irl stuff, and repeat...

BTW, thanks for those Monual stories, I have been lurking here for a
year or so and always enjoys finding a new story when i check out AGE.
