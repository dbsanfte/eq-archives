They originally said the buddy keys had to be used by July 2nd.  I don't have 
a way to verify this though.  I did open a 2nd account using my buddy key but 
did not enter in my credit card info so after the first month it became 
inactive.  If I ever do want to start new characters I now have an account I 
can activate any time and start playing.
