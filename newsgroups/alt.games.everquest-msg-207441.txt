Thanks but i've already been there.  It tells you how to raise or lower your 
faction with different groups but how do I find out what group an NPC is a 
part of.  For instance the Merchant Dansie McVicker in Everfrost.  I am 
amiable and want to raise my faction with her to ally.  What faction does she 
belong to?  I can't find that info anywhere.
