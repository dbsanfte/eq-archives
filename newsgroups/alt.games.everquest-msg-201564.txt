Oh yeah. I second that one with enthusiasm.

Absolutely, and if you like those, try also "A Fire upon the Deep"... 
its follow-up "A Deepness in the Sky" is supposed to be excellent too, 
although I haven't had time to read it yet.

Another excellent series is Philip Pullman's "His Dark Materials". It's 
labeled as "young adult" fiction, but don't let that put you off... Like 
the Harry Potter books, this is best enjoyed by adults. In fact, these 
books ("The Golden Compass", "The Subtle Knife" and "The Amber Spyglass") 
are quite a bit darker and edgier than the HP books at their darkest, 
and they deal with much more mature themes. "The Golden Compass" is 
titled "Northern Lights" in the UK, by the way.

Right now, I'm one-quarter into "Perdido Street Station", by China 
Miï¿½ville (it's a big book). Very good, well written and with interesting 
characters and environments. The only thing is... I cannot help but 
thinking that he writes exactly like Terry Pratchett would, if he didn't 
have a sense of humour. Speaking of which, *anything* by Terry Pratchett 
is excellent, and he gets better with time. His most recent Discworld 
novels "Thief of Time" and "Night Watch" are arguably among the best, if 
not the best, of the twenty-odd.

Another pleasant surprise (hmm... it appears I've read more Fantasy 
recently than I thought) was the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. I 
like him very much as a horror writer (which is high praise from someone 
who does not care at all for the horror genre... I don't read horror 
from anybody else), and he certainly can cut the mustard too as a 
Fantasy writer.

I think I better stop now, before I drift off into recommending SF books... :)
