"A political candidate who jumps to conclusions without knowing the 
facts is not a person you want as commander in chief,"

G. W. Bush, October 27, 2004



OK, so the guy who went to war based on erroneous assumptions about WMDs 
would be which candidate?

The guy who limited embryonic stem cell research to current lines which, 
on examination, fall well short of sufficient to do any useful work, was 
which candidate?

The guy who handed out a massive tax cut based on a projected budget 
surplus which rapidly vanished was which candidate?

The guy who reversing his logic 180 degrees so as to issue the -same- 
tax cut based on a projected budget deficit and a theory that it would 
reverse that deficit was which candidate?  (I'll grant you, the 
projected deficit did come thru, this time... but the reverse sure 
didn't, and past attempts to do the same magic trick had already failed, 
making the jump to the conclusion that -this- time they would work seem 
even more farfetched)

How about the guy that used that same reversed logic two more times, 
even in the face of it not working the previous two (or the first time 
when the action was the same but the reasoning was a mirror image)? 
Thats not just a leap of faith, thats continuing to walk deeper and 
deeper into the tar pit after leaping there in the first place.

The guy that assumed we wouldn't need the troops his defense chief of 
staff was telling him we would because the Iraqi people would rise up 
and greet us with joy was which candidate?

The guy that assumed that we'd be able to pay for our invasion of Iraq 
with profits from Iraqi oil... instead of ending up 200 billion in the 
red thus far and looking for more cash to spend (another 75 billion or 
so, last I heard) was which guy?

The guy that looked at warnings telling him that Al-Queda was planning 
an attack in the US using hijacked aircraft to hit buildings in New York 
and Washington DC and did nothing because he concluded they were 
unlikely was which candidate?

In short, I think Bush has just hit on one of his rare true statements, 
and if I were Kerry I'd have that film clip burned into a nice 30 second 
ad spot and you'd have the image of W saying that conterposed with all 
of the above and a dozen other such leaps burned into your eyeballs over 
the next few days.  Nothing burns Boy George as much as mocking him with 
his own words.
