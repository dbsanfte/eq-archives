Here are some where exchanges were required that don't sound like slot
changes or graphics changes:

Feb 21, 2001 patch: changed proc on Chilled Scythe.

Apr 17, 2001 patch: Grand Master Wrist Wraps changed to create Pouch
of Quellios.

May 8, 2001 patch: Ivory Handled Falchion fixed to not give an out of
charges message when it procs.

I got tired of reading old patch messages at that point and stopped.
