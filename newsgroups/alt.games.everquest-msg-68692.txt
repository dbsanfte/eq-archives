When folks join our guild, they know upfront what is expected and what
is acceptable.  Generally, when folks join they are scrutinized for
the playing times and their willingness to participate in raids.  That
"probation" period can last from a few days to several weeks.

We haven't had many problems with people not being on the same page. 

As for "all" clerics, we have a fairly long waiting list of people
wanting to join and are unable to do so since we're in the process of
putting in hard caps on numbers (having 70 people in ToVN is just
plain stupid).
