Had to add this because blackburrow, crush and a few other places were
really important to me when i was playing eq1 early on. Having lots of
people there was fun because if nothing else, you got a faction hit every
time you helped someone. This was a big deal to me as a low level iksar.
Same story in great divide with the giants/wolves. Ah, I remember seeing my
first ring war, and discovering the hard way that a light heal could
apparently draw more agro than a guild's worth of firepower. Not the best
way to learn about being summoned either. LOADING...

I hated the fact that every man and his dog was trying to kill their deity.
It made no sense. Ok, I wanted to kill my god because i was an iksar monk
who wanted to be agnostic, but a paladin slaughtering her beloved goddess
for phat lewtz is just nauseating.

 Ah well, here's hoping EQ2 has more internal consistency!

At least this time round my iksar
