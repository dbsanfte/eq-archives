And, of course, this does not even address the issue of damage bonuses, 
which melee characters get, and that swings the difference between 
weapons even further.  For one handed weapons, the damage bonus is a 
constant based on the level of the player, this makes fast weapons even 
better.  In the above example, at level 65, the bonus is 13, so, the 
values would then become:

19/10 = 1.9
25/19 = 1.32

For two handed weapons it's more complicated, as the damage bonus is 
based on the weapon delay as well as player level.  There is a very nice 
table for damage bonuses at lucy.fnord.net.
