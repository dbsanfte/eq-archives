Enchanters can't raise the level of the charmed mob.  They can turn that
level 9 puma into a tough level 9 puma...but it is still level 9.
Beastlords can raise its level.  I don't know by how much, but I think one
of the lower level Beastlord spells raises the pet level by 5, so I'd guess
that a level 60 Beastlord does considerably better.
