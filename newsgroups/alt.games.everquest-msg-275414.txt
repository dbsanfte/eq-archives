I think we agree. I think, you missed my meaning. 

Your acquaintaince, like many normal people, approve of the filtering in 
libraries both in principle and even in practice but they don't see fit 
to make it their mission to actually involve themselves. To subvert the 
selection process of what exactly gets filtered to coincide with their 
own narrow views that are not represented by the greater majorities.
