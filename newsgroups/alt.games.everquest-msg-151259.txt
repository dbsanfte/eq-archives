    My old guild had someone like that. The guy never participated in guild
events, but whenever a mob he or one of his "friends" needed was up he would
rant, insult and cause a huge commotion in guild chat. To make it worse - he
had a wife (RL and in game) who was just as bad. They left EQ for DaoC
(thank god) , only to come back 6 months later (because their guild in DaoC
fell around them). When they came back, it was a total uproar.  9 out of 10
officers wanted to immediatly go to the zone they were in to disband them
from the guild within a minute of seeing "We're Back!" in guild chat.
However,  they had 2 or 3 supporters that we considered good people that
said they would disband if we didn't give these people a 2nd chance.

    Over the next month, they caused many , many problems within the guild,
several people left the guild,  until they finally got the idea they really
were not wanted and went back to DaoC.

    All I can say regarding your issue is -
1. make sure your log is on whenever this guy is around, if he says
something threatening, then you get trained you have your log or report to
prove he threatened.
2.    If he joined a new guild , bring his behavior up to an officer/ leader
of the new guild
3.    If it continues, have anyone you are grouped with send in petitions
and / or reports when ever this guy does something like that.  Eventually
guides / gms will see the pattern about him, but make sure its not just you
sending them.
4. Do not take his bait to reply to ooc / shout taunts, it just sinks you to
his lvl
