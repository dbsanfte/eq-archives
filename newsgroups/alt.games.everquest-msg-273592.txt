If my gear is up to date (blue at least but i prefer yellow/orange) then i
have no problems fighting a group of greens provided there are no casters.
Casters can kill you fast, directly or indirectly, and sometimes members of
groups get into a position where the program decides you can't target them.
But they can target you, oh yesssss.

20 pal 19 sage and hating making all the stroma washes, resins and so forth
required by my alts,

Actually that brings up a point. I found making food/drink items easy xp and
fun. You can use all the products, the nodes are ridiculously close to the
city and safe, and there are so many varieties that you can usually get the
first time bonus xp.

My craftsman has been powering through the levels whilst my other characters
hit dead ends trying to manage huge inventory space problems for all the
subcombines, only to make the item and not be able to sell them, or find
they can't be sold easily (strongboxes might sell well at upper levels but
even so, you can only sell a few at time and i had heaps of app 3 scrolls
etc selling every night, then when app 4 came out i sold them all over
again).

I hate the interdependence of the classes. Maybe that's better in a guild.
It's just annoying to look at the cost of the subcombines and realise you
are making a loss every time, unless you skill up an alt, and with only 4
slots to play with you will only be able to do so in a limited way, although
i have seen a few people with 2 accounts.

I find the actual tradeskilling dull grinding for the most part, with a few
moments of pleasure towards the end. I'd prefer to be able to automate the
process to some extent, at least when the darn process is quite grey. I'm
not happy with eq2 tradeskilling but it is better than eq1, and possibly
less vulnerable than swg was to abuse. Not sure, i have seen a few people
who i suspect were macroing.

However, i'm stumped if i can think of a better way to create the tradeskill
process. Is there any other game which has done it better or is
tradeskilling a weak point (like roleplaying, alas!) in all these games?
