Who said there was?   "I have to have KEI to play" and "I refuse to
have KEI" are totally different.   They do have one major similarity,
however:   both mark you as a moron to be avoided.

If you'd turn down a free KEI for you or your group from a
passing enchanter (or a group Aego from a passing cleric) you're
every bit as big a moron as a player who won't play without it.
And, yes, that's *exactly* what "xx who REFUSES to get KEI
LFG" means.

Why refuse to get KEI?  Because you're incapable of controlling
yourself with all that mana flowing?   Isn't that the same problem
that people *with* KEI have?   Or is it just because you want a
"pure" gaming experience?   I'd sure prefer someone who knows
the benefits and accepts them of upper-level buffs over someone
who's more concerned about some supposed "purity" that doesn't
exist anyway.   Or is your cleric still wearing gear and using spells
that were available only at release?   Or do you not think that
mudflation in gear is as much a problem as mudflation in mana
regen?
