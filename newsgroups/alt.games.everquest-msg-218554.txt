So he had issues walking into the virtual world, ok. That doesn't 
absolve the virtual world of responsibility. He might not have been 
suicidal until EQ was through with him.

Bear in mind that this is hypothetical... I'm not debating the mental 
state and circumstances of the actual person who committed suicide, 
because I don't know what they were. It entirely possible he was 
suicidal before hand... its entirely possible  (even likely) SoE has no 
fault whatsoever in his death but that doesn't mean SoE is inherently 
innocent... the fact that they added an 'exit timer' suggests that their 
lawyers felt it was appropriate to 'put a sign up' warning people that 
there was a puddle on the floor.
