	Next time ya wanna get rid of some stuff locally bob, if that
garage sale isn't around the corner and ya don't wanna wait, and its
something ya don't wanna just throw away, a place that's well used
(and free) in our neck of the woods is http://seattle.craigslist.org
Got a free washer and dryer through it, bought a motorcycle through
it, have unloaded furniture I didn't want through it, got free fire
wood, etc...  A year 'round online garage sale, no registration, no
fees.  Dunno if their sections for other cities are any good or even
how many people outside of the greater seattle area use it even in our
own state, but for king/snohomish county at least, its well used and
very useful.
