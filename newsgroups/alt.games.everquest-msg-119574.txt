Their 'greed' seems to fluctuate.  I currently annoyed with the
fletching vendor in Surefall, as she seems to be in a greedy phase and
wants 6cp for components she usually asks 5cp for, etc. 
(If I want to find out if I have a max price vendor, I check how much
they'll give me for my cabbages. If it's less than 1gp 4sp 3cp, I find
another vendor if I can)
