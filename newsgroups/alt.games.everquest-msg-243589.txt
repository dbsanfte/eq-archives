The assumption was that in order to be an 'investment' that it had to
have financial compensation as a reward. There are many other ways one
can be rewarded on that investment in time.. a strengthened bond..
love.. entertainment.. whatever. Certainly by playing catch with your
kid you don't imply you get nothing out of it?
