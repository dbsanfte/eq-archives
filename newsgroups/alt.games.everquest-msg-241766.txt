Originally I only had a storebought drum and it felt like I was running at
sow, or  something close, hard to tell. the skeletons were keeping up with
me during this.


then a bard one level higher than me *FLEW* past me so I sent him a tell
asking what drum he used, to which he replied trueborn drum of dark rites,
so I went to bazaar and got one and tried the run again, ran much faster but
I couldnt outrun the skeletons spell range before they landed. they seem to
really enjoy casting fear. which interuptes singing and by the time I
recover, they've casted it again.


*shrug*
