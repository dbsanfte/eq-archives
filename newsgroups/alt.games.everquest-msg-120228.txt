I was going to leave this thread as it was, but I wanted to point out to you
that it doesn't always work that way.  Someone anonymously called the
inspector general on our commander once.  I have no fucking clue who it was,
or what it was about.  We only surmised that it was someone in our unit, as
that is where you'd most likely find someone unhappy with that officer.  We
were deployed at the time, so naturally when we instantly (that very day)
got a longer work day and severely curtailed freedom of movement, it was all
for the sake of the mission, right?  Of course not.

Please do not presume to tell me what I was supposed to learn when you don't
know the specifics of the lessons to which I refer.
