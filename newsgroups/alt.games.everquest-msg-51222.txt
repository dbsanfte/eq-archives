OK, so thats' a heck of a nice item.

How did the guy get it?

He happened to be in the right place at the right time, didn't screw
up so badly that he was out of the lottery, and so got handed this
pretty much at random.

Anyone see a flaw here?  This is Monty Haul gaming at its finest;
he didn't earn the thing, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or
reason to GM events at all as far as I'm concerned.  They
favor members of large guilds with porting characters, because
you need to have someone in the zone to report that something
is happening at all, and then you need fast transport to get there
before its all over with.  Then its random chance whether its
a total player death scene, or a giveaway scene like this one.

The quests are generally static and obtuse, GM quests are
actually just as static and even more obtuse.  While EQ is an
interesting strategic game with roleplaying elements, the
"quest" parts are by and large the worst part of the game!
