Good for you, one less barbarian rogue...

Gnome power!

Oh... Well, alright, if you want int then gnome or de are definately the
way to go.  On the second teir, dwarves and wood elves have a decent base
wis which is just as good (ok, halflings too, but why would anyone want to
be a halfling?).  Half elves aren't any better off int/wis wise than
barbarians.

I think you want dwarf.  Nice str, nice sta, nice wis (for a rogue).  
Might want to dump 10 points or so into agi, dwarves are a bit weak there,
although it doesn't matter in the long run.

By the way, as a gnome rake who didn't know what the hell he was doing when
he started, current unbuffed stats are 145 str, 103 sta, 135ish dex, 160ish
agi and 112 int.
