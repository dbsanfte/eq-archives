I have...its related to zone speed partly and partly to sound card - 
at least it was for me....if its crap for that zone you end up
with the game seeing 2 zones in succession and falling over. So far as I
know its the only zone where you ca be carried to another zone line that
quickly without doing anything.....all the other boats need you to move or
have a much longer travel time - even the BBM end of the same route is
much slower. Sometimes it was a crash for me sometimes just ending up
locking for a long time and waking up going back across the Ocean of
Tears.

So anything to improve zone time helped....I started zoning in as the boat
left EFP docks....late but managable if I hopped off the boat. Also
everything involving ambient sound, zone times like this and zoning in
general improved when I got off the SB Live series of soundcards....they
really had problems with all th above - a techie friend explained why to
me involving the card needing to hand stuff back to the processor at
the wrong time or too much at a time in periods of high load on the
CPU or some such....I upgraded to an Audigy and my life vastly improved.

Any of those raise any prospects?
