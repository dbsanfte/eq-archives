The way I look at it, I play EQ for pleasure.  It gives me pleasure to act
with consideration for others.  This is probably why I play a cleric.  If
someone is going to be an ass and play in a manner that is harassing, I
would move. But I would most likely send them a polite tell first explaining
in detail why I thought they were an ass :)

Then to totally confuse them, I might just blow them a kiss.
