Ahaha good point, the same is true of rock songs
which "cause" suicide or anything else. A person offs
themselves because their life is so bad that they want to end it.
Its never because of that one thing they happen to do that people try
to sue over. Nor does anyone say, "Well since elvis influenced my
music I'll send half my royalties to the graceland estate every year,
kk thnx."
