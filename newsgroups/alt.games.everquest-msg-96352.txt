Of note, a Beastlord always buffs his pet to the same level.

The staves of mastery do increase the post 49+ pet's level by
1, and it's max damage by 2.

If you go to http://www.magecompendium.com
and go to the pets/pet statistics page, you will
see the levels and max damage for each summoning.

I.E.  Vocerate Earth summons a pet from level 41 to 45
the level 41 pet hits for 50
the level 42 pet hits for 52
the level 43 pet hits for 54
the level 44 pet hits for 56
the level 45 pet hits for 58 

These are all maxes.  If you watch your 
pets damage, you'll see what level your pet
is.  In some circumstances, you *REALLY* 
want the higher pet.  Level counts, the
higher pet hits more effectively and tanks
better.  

One of the circumstances I mentioned above
is camping Gornit at level 44-48.  I used
a water pet (focused, it's the best tank 
available.)  If I got the lower level ones
(33,34) and got a higher level Gornit (he
has a range from 34-38ish.  The 34 hits for
88max, the 38 hits for 96max) My pet would
usually get low enough on health that Gornit
would frenzy (not run) and I'd either lose 
the pet, and have to finish him with a nuke.  Or
have to get an extra nuke in to finish him
before the pet died.  Both of these cause problems
when you have just enough mana regen to hold
the camp.

I'm not overly impressed with the mage AA skills.  I would
have loved to see one that gave you consistently high end
summons.

I.E.
1 level - all Greater Voc pets are summoned at 46 or above
2 levels - all greater Voc pets are summoned at 47 or above
3 levels - all greater Voc pets are summoned at max level.

Of course, the appropriate staff of mastery adds one level to
that.
