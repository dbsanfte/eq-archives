    Have you thought about just starting a group?  That's what I've been
doing.  /tell whoever_I_see_shouting_for_LDoN_group_in_my_range Hi.. I'm
starting a LDoN group now!  Please come to this Wherever Place while I
get more members.  If you have LoY, don't be afraid to put up that you
are group looking for members.  Troll the players LFG lists.  Send out
tells and make it happen.

   I might not be the best group leader ever.  I might not even be a
good one at all.  But I am willing to be one.
