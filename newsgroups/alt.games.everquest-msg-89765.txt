How many times have you taken down the AoW?

Verant has done a good job of setting up the higher-end mobs
in Velious and Luclin such that simply getting "enough people"
doesn't help achieve the goal, and may in fact be a *disadvantage*.

belittle, or if you're just imagining how "easy" it must
be without having tried.

Walter Mitty, is that you?
