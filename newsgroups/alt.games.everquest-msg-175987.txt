PLing a caster is never very effective.  Yes, you can be PLed to 30 in
a day using the druid DS shield method, but you will lack the vital
skill points in your casting disciplines, and fizzle away your mana
bar the first time you try to solo.  In case you find someone to give
you a hands up, after you got your levels, get a KEI and stand in the
corner, casting your lowest level spells over and over and over until
all spell skills are maxed.  The biggest drawback for the future
soloing shaman will be your low defense skill, which is harder to
raise the higher you get.
If you want to make a new shaman and can afford some twinkage, get him
a) the cash for his spells till 24 (then cash becomes usually less of
an issue since he can hunt mammoth for cahs)
b) depending on your wealth, as many peices of JB armor you can get. 
Prices are so low for that stuff, it's the best AC for the buck
Then run the newbie quests for the remaining slots, that stuff is not
bad for the efford it takes.
I found high AC gear the best way to PL a caster, you can take the
hits (therefor get the defence skill-ups), and don't loose too much
time/mana with healing.
