Well, IMHO if you are not there, you aren't camping it; and camping two
floors might be excessive; but the whole sit-and-wait-14-hours for some mob
to spawn seems to be a relic from the early days of EQ. I think they need to
re-write part of it so that epic mobs are instanced and hard, so you can't
multi quest or what have you. Have the epic as a series of trials,
expandable by items that drop outside the adventures (for all players, not
just the players who can take the time for a dungeon) so that a casual
player can conceivably work towards their epic in an exciting way, and so
the epic would not become obsolete.

I've been in high keep when one group claimed all the goblins. I wasn't
impressed and I don't have any record of good gm interventions (although i
met some nice guides) in these situations. PC is another one; one group
claiming the equivalent of 3 camps of orcs in size as their private
hunting/farming ground. Nothing like being unable to fight a deep blue mob
because a lv 52 farmer is slaughtering everything is sight.

And don't get me started on bards harvesting a whole goddamn zone of
grimlings :-<
