Normally I scoff and laugh at posts such as this. But it's gotten to
the point where SOE has not only dropped the ball, but completely
popped it and failed to have a puncture repair kit on standby.

The Big Patch (the one before last) had been proven to be chock full
of game-stopping bugs to the point of absurdity. Its problems had been
incessantly reported on Test, and it even included bugs THAT HAD
EXISTED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF GOD BUT SUMMARILY FIXED SINCE. HOW
CAN THIS FREAKIN' HAPPEN?

Then, with the most recent patch, they proclaim to have fix said
problems, while breaking almost everything else that made the game
playable. Pathing issues. Annoying pinkness. Underworld mobs. Is there
simply no end to their ability to screw things up big time?

Just the fact alone that bugs from pre-existing releases that had been
fixed are now back is ridiculous. You either fix it or you don't,
guys, not go back and forth.

I cannot even begin to convey how dissapointed I am in SOE with this.
To top it off, there's STILL no VISIBLE option to get rid of the
goddamn GoD order splashscreen. I SAID I DON'T WANT TO ORDER IT THE
FIRST TIME, WHY THE HELL WOULD I WANT TO THE NEXT 5,000 TIMES?!
