Hi Joshua,

As far as I know we don't have game cards in Australia ... the only way
to play the game is by credit card and that means a different amount
each month because of the fluctating Australian dollar against the US
dollar.

If you do a search on Google groups you will turn up a thread here
about a month ago with someone asking the same question about
Australian guilds and what servers they are on .. on my server there
are 3 Australian guilds and one New Zealand (that is Bristlebane).

regards

@ndrew
