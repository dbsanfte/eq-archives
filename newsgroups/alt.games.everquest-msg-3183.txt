A high level Wiz came by and whack one of the guards
in misty thicket. He ask if I wanted the loot and I said
sure, so I waited and the guard had a 'silver ring' lore
item on him. I tried to sell it, but it's worthless. It's not
the paw of opalla silver ring since it's not magical. Any
ideas what is't for ?
