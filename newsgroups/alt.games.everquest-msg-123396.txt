It's not a question of everything being a grey area, but there are
definately shades of black and white here.  It is not possible to always
classify everything as black or white.  I think that's what David was trying
to say here, I could be wrong.  I suspect that David would agree that the
Holocaust falls very far on the "wrong" side of the scale.  But there are
definately areas where there is a lack of consensus over whether some things
are "right" or "wrong".

I do not determine what is right or wrong according to my religious beliefs,
I have no religious beliefs.  I still have a set of morals that I try to
live by, those morals happen to be largely Judeo-Christian in origin, as
that is what I was raised with.  There are areas where I strongly disagree
with traditional Judeo-Christian morals however.  I prefer to determine
right and wrong based on whether or not I percieve that someone else is
being harmed by my actions.  I also admit that I refrain from doing some
things due to the fact that they are illegal, and I choose not to take the
chance on being punished, even though I personally do not believe those
actions are wrong in and as of themselves.
