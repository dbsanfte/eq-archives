This is because they did something pretty weird. The 50+ hell levels have
*not* been smoothed out. Each level takes exactly the same amount of xp to
finish as before. What they did change was the amount of xp mobs give, so it
seems like things are better. At level 60, mobs give 75% of their old xp,
because level 60 is now a longer level. At level 59, mobs give 150% xp (or
something), because 59 is now a shorter level. This is all separate from the
'tough mob' bonus.

At least , thats the current theory. Odd, but it does the job.
