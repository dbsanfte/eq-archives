The cleric has some keen insight on how the other 4 people in the group are
doing?  Still thinking you're god?  In my experience the clerics (rightfully
for the most part) are the least aware of anything but the health bars of
the group.

Thus why you got a different response.  If James meant the same thing, I
refer him to my previous response to you on the subject.  I got the
impression he meant mobs out of line-of-sight behind walls but in the same
room.

I'm not such a stickler.  Hell, I don't care if you say 30 when you're at 20
knowing that you'll be at 30 before a mob hits.  I get a feel for what each
cleric can do in comparison to how much mana they say they have after a
while anyway.

Of course, you're going the wrong direction.  Pointless, as I'd adjust based
on my observation of your capabilities too.  :P
