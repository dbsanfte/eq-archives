Is it possible to solo charm the Wraith of Jaxion in CoM for the chanter
epic?

I've done the spectral librarian and Impaler Tzilug solo, the former was
easy the latter a little tricky! but doable. Felia will be simple enough I
think, but CoM would require a reasonable force unless......

I keep hearing about Grav Fluxing up to the ramp for a wizzy spell quest
thus bypassing the castle and the need of rog etc...

Where should you stand for the grav flux and where does it put you? Once on
the ramp is it possible to do another grav flux and bypass the 1st platform
building? I use EQatlas maps, so locs would be cool :)

If its only possible to bypass the Castle then what is the minimum force
required to get to Jaxion?

61 chanter, likes to take risks!
