The mobs are fine crossing the boundaries in DAoC.  You can tell where the
boundaries are because you get a message when you cross one ("You have
entered Foo") and sometimes the ground is a very slightly different shade on
the two sides, so you can see the boundary.

Oops.  Apart from the transition between city areas and outside areas, and
when you found some way to travel fast, how well does it work?  That is, if
you just run around outside, are there any oddities like that, or is it like
being one giant EQ-like zone?

When you log into DAoC, or when you arrive after taking a port, or when you
zone into or out of a capital city or dungeon, there are a few seconds of
graphics lag.  If you spin around twice, it goes away.  The first spin is
jerky, the second spin less so, and then it has it all figured out.  I
presume this is while it is loading stuff in the immediate area.

There is a slight hint of what you are describing from SWG in the DAoC
housing zone when you run through.  The housing zones are six regions, each
with maybe 100-200 player houses.  The houses can have a lot of
customization objects places in the yard and on the house.  (Various lawn
ornaments, signs for each tradeskill, a porch for a consignment merchant, a
consignment merchant, arches, trellises, pools, flower beds, vegetable
gardens, and stuff like that).

OK, time to make a table of this ("zone" means "loading, please wait" type
zones):

    EQ1     zoned
    AC      seemless (totally?)
    DAoC    large zoneless outdoor regions, cities and dungeons are zones
    SWG     zone per planet
    CoH     zoned
    FF      zoned (but clever use of putting zone point inside from zone
                boundary so they can make it look like you see things
                from other zones)
    GW      big zones
    EQ2     zoned
    WoW     zoneless

Anyone know about Horizons, Toontown, EQ for PS2, Shadowbane, AO, UO, WWII
Online, Neocron, Second Life, There, Lineage (I and II), and Matrix Online (they
are in beta now, so perhaps someone knows) (OT: and it is the most
ridiculous beta I've ever had someone violate an NDA to tell me about--the
servers are only available from 3pm to 9pm every day, so my friend in the
beta has not managed to get playtime while the servers are open!).

Did I miss any?  (I know I left off things like Ragnarok Online...just doing
the ones I think are available reasonably in North America).
