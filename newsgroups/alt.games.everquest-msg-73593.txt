OK, now I know who to attribute the comment to in another reply (which
I would have known had I read all THEN replied=>).

Your last line doesnt hold with me.  Because players exploit an aspect
of game mechanics  that allow players to buy, sell and trade in a
player driven economy does not mean that Verant had any intention of
having those same items transferred to characters on the same account
or that those same items might be bestowed on those for whom they are
well overpowering and to a degree alter game balance.
