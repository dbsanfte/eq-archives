I was a Beta tester for DAOC and what i didn't like was I found the
battles a bit boring. Pretty much just cast 1 or 2 spells then melee
over and over and I died alot! Also the fact that is no Bind like in
EQ and no casting when meleeing makes it a downer. Unless they changed
it since BETA. Anyway EQ as tons of flaws itself but in overall I'd
say EQ is better because it as more charme mostly. If they'd make mana
and health regen faster in EQ it would change the game alot for the
better.
