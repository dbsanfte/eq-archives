First off make sure you COMPLETELY removed your old video card drivers

Download the following before you begin..
DirectX8.1 www.microsoft.com/directx
Latest supported Nvidia Drivers www.nvidia.com refer to the following
site for the correct driver.
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/compatability_matrix.jsp


1. Go into the Control Panel and under the ADD/REMOVE SOFTWARE icon
uninstall any references to the old video card drivers. Also remove
the Nvidia drivers that you installed with your new card. Reboot

2. When returning to windows, the NEW HARDWARE FOUND wizard will come
up and will tell you that it has found a new VGA card and will prompt
you for drivers. Hit CANCEL! 

3. Install DirectX8.1 and reboot. (If the system asks for a video
driver on reboot hit CANCEL)

4. Install the recommended NVidia driver you downloaded and reboot.

5. Adjust the video card settings and test EQ.

Good Luck!
