No, at level 30, you should be able to raise it above 50 I believe, of 
course, I could be wrong.  Make absolutely certain that you did put one 
point in each of the other specializations, as that is the only reason I 
know of, short of having a different one over 50, that would prevent you 
from raising spec:evoc above 50.
