Unless they've changed this recently, the DS can do almost all the
damage and as long as the lowbie gets one hit in - he gets the xp -
provided no other PC has done damage to it. Ive PLed alts many times
this way with a druid. The only time when I didnt get the xp is when
the lowbie fanned every swing and the DS did all the damage. A single
1 damage hit will do it (be it from melee or spells).
 
PLing in areas where the mobs dont turn and run is the fastest way.
Kurns tower is supreme for this as the undead will beat themselves
silly on you. (Paladul as well - at least the non bandit mobs). So a
good trick is, once you actually hit a mob, turn and start whacking on
the next and so on and so on.
