Ok.   I think I'm calm enough to respond to this in depth now.  This really
suprised me coming from you Kaev. A real "Welcome to Usenent" moment.

You also managed to catch about the one thing that really gets me in all
this.   I can live with the situation while they fix it...  but the whole
attitude of "Oh theres nothing wrong, warriors are just whining again"
really gets to me and pushes buttons.  This is a legitimate issue that I
feel rather strongly about, and someone just dismissing it in that way...

If you want to drop the BS and insults and have a nice, well reasoned
discussion about it, fine.   But if you're just spoiling for a flame war,
please take it somewhere else.  Pick a fight with DT or something, he seems
to enjoy them.

Do you really want to compare resumes, Kaev?   Because in a discussion of
post 60 healing abilities of Paladins I assure you mine does stack up at
least as well as yours.    You've played a mid to high 50's paladin, true,
but I grouped with a 60 - 65 paladin as a member of my regular group every
day for over a year before retiring my warrior.   I know what thier heals
can do, and even more specificly I know what they can do healingwise if they
are not main tanking.

If you honestly feel that paladin heals are as useless as you portray them,
then I doubt you have the same experience using them.

It's as fast as the 1000 hp druid heal at level 60.   Thats damn good in my
book.  Perhaps my friend was just a better paladin, but he used it often to
save my life.

And what exactly would I "like to claim"?

I made no such claims, so kindly stop creating strawman arguments.

And?   Even with the recast issues, it's a damn nice spell.  My friend could
cast it every time it was needed and never run into mana issues.   Really
helped take part of the burden off of our druid, especially before druid CH
was added.

> You can't heal a group with that,

You're supposed to be a backup healer, not a main healer.  If thats the role
you wish to fill, good luck, but I don't think it'll work too well.

So make up a hotkey to tell him when it is being used, and yell at him a
couple times if he overwrites it.   Assuming you have a cleric there.

My, aren't we jumping to conclusions about what I'm saying.

OMG, I feel that paladin heals are useful.  I must be full of class envy!
Oh, wait... I also love druid evacs.  And shaman slows.   And enchanter mez
as well, not even mentioning haste.   I like that a necro can summon my
corpse if I can't get to it.  Oh my god, I must envy everybody.  Thank you
so much for pointing that out to me.

I didn't make any numerical comparisions.  Please show where I did or
retract this.

I assume you have a quote for where I said this.

Please post a link, as I'd be tremendously curious to see who was using my
name then.  As far as I know I wasn't even playing the game during Kunark.
I quit my original character in 99 before Kunark came out, and didn't begin
playing again until January of 2001, when Velious was already pretty old
news.
