Are you insane? We've spent *decades* seeing our country bombed, admittedly
on a lesser scale, by terrorist organisations funded in part by Americans
who are sending money back to the "old country".

For what its worth I would normally count myself as a Dove, but this time I
understand entirely the desire for an ultra-violence response. I just hope
you folks take the time to choose your targets as those actively involved
in terror before launching yourself into a 30 year war as we did by retaliating
against an entire people.

My prayers to those of you in NY, and my sympathies to those who lost loved 
ones.

Luck, America.
