His LT is *MORE* than 1500?????? Krist Onna Cracker! I think Nortlav's
was only 1500!  Well, so much for hitting the real VS. Thanks for the

Yeah, we set up there for buffing once we cleared a couple of trash mobs
out of there. Kind of crowded though, even with two groups. I can't
imagine buffing up two dozen there. Tough encounter, but a lot of fun.
Going to try it again this week. (We still ahve at least three more
druids and two rangers ready for that step who need the rock.)
