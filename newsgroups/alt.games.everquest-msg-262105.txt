Yah right.. that's how come I had a 15 toon in Crushbone.. solo'ing in the 
throne room (aren't pet classes with good pet gear great) and all of a 
sudden a orc messenger spawns, now being as I was kicking the snot outta 
yellows and reds already, I didn't think twice about smacking him with my 
2k+hp 15th lvl bst pet.. he went down in 3 hits.. I went down in 2, total 
time, mebbe 5 seconds...the SOB hits for 600-900.. and there was no one 
spawning him.. he just popped.. I logged my 62 dru on and got there as fast 
as possible but he was gone.. which was good, being as he's 65 and will hurt 
you.
