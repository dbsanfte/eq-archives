An Erudite is decidedly -not- too big to squeeze in, I've done it repeatedly.

You look at the spot, move forward while looking up and down and
side to side, ducking and unducking, sitting and unsitting, basically
wriggling
like mad until the server gets confused as to which side of the hole you
are on.  If you look at it from an alternate view point, or watch someone
else doing it, you can see how the server gets confused; your swimming body
appears to stretch out halfway thru the hole anyway, while sitting you occupy
less horizontal space.

You may want to consider getting Enduring Breath if you aren't good at this,
particularly a good idea for low level alts, which probably have a Swim
skill so low that they will die trying to swim the tunnel to the zone line and
then
the tunnel past the zone line to the surface inside.
