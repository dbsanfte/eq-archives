Well then!  If that's the case, I withdraw any testiness your
misunderstanding evoked in my reply, and apologize for it!

This is true, if you're talking about our SOW/Wolf Form ability.  SOW (or
the EFFECT) is far from a Druid ability however, there are THREE classes to
choose from there, AND a magic items that give it to you on demand, one of
which can be purchased straight over the counter.  We can be replaced by a
handful of plat in this area.  Wolf form has its uses, but is outdoor only,
drops on zoning, and can get you very very dead.  There's a permanent trail
of my wolf form urine leading away from one of the Everfrost guards if you
don't believe that.

If wolf form is so great why does every group I've been in scream "no" when
I suggest group wolf form?  Why is my blood spattered all over Dawnshroud
Peaks and Firiona Vie from using it?  Both of these are large outdoor zones
that you would think of as being Druid friendly, but if we try to use our
wolf form, we are killed on sight.  I am, in fact, beginning to believe that
being in wolf form will get you killed more places than being an Iksar will.

No, these are nice abilities WHEN they can be used, but they are severely
restricted and deadly if you make a mistake.  KOS zones are everywhere, and
as such this "signature" spell is a speciality item.

Hmm.  I thought we were going to be more civil here.  I guess I was wrong.

<sigh>  Ok, I guess I need to withdraw the apology about being testy in my
reply.  Obviously it was warranted.

Also as obviously, if some complained that their doctor cut off their leg
unnecessarily, you would tell them that they still had another one and to
quit whining.  If they said they couldn't play pro basketball anymore, you
would say "If playing basketball is all you can think of to do then you are
seriously deficient in imagination."

This is a game, and each class is supposed to have a certain amount of
utility.  VI has just rendered one of our main speciality unnecessary, or at
least of severely reduced value.  Does it destroy the class?  No, but it
DOES reduce it's value to other classes.  Do I want to change it back?  No,
I think they SHOULD make travel easier, but I also think they should do
SOMETHING to replace the utility they have just rendered obsolete.

It shouldn't be too hard to do, and they could take the opportunity to make
us more group friendly.   A restricted version of a "Group port to member
X's bind point", or even just removing the KOS settings on the group version
of our wolf form would do well to defining a new identity for us.

Well, obviously you AREN'T able to carry on an intelligent debate on the
topic.

Look, if you have a hard time dealing with normal people after you've had to
deal with fuckwits, then I'm suprised you're still IN this game,  It's FULL
of fuckwits, sometimes finding a good reasonable hunting partner is the
toughest job a player HAS.

So, I suggest you get OVER your anger at the fuckwits, and I suggest you
stop calling legitimate concerns, rationally put forward "whining",
"bitchy", or just plain "shit".

Oh, and THIS little Jewel:

> " Turn

I never said this, implied this, or in any way supported it.  This is
completely in your head.  From the start I've said that they shouldn't
render useless one class's defining ability without giving them something to
take it's place.  That in NO way promotes the withdrawal of the new travel
abilities, it promotes giving the Druids something to take the place of what
they've made useless.

If you're going to keep jumping to conclusions and reading things into my
posts that don't exist, you may as well go off into the corner and argue
with YOURSELF.  Apparently you are more interested in what you want to THINK
I'm saying than you are in actual conversation.  (Conversation involving the
EXCHANGE of ideas, of necessity involves TWO WAY communications)

The obsolesence of any character class's main abilities is a legitimate
concern, and while you have been very strong on deriding the anologies I
have put forward to show that, you have been very weak on explaining WHY
they are "bogus".

<sigh>  Well, I don't particularly feel like debating with someone that
calls me names and carries the debate inexorably toward a flame war, so if
you can't discuss this reasonably , don't expect another reply.
