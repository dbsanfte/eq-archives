	I don't get rain spells.  If I cast them on a rooted group
one or all inevitably break root and move away from the affected area.
If I cast them on the group attacking the tank the ones not actually
being hit by the tank will immediately come after me (moving out of
the affected area).  Snare doesn't seem to slow them enough to keep them
in the affected area long enough for more than a wave of damage.  About
the *only* time I've been able to use these is when a whole group of mobs
is snared AND weak enough so that the first wave will take them too low
to move.  (That's happened like twice...)

	On paper these spells look good.  How do I use them effectively?
