One that maintains the domain intact. The mail still hits Yahoo, it
just doesn't get to me. It is a quite deliberate choice to not munge
the domain on my part - I want that spam getting to yahoo's servers.

Yahoo's spam filter is pretty good for the spam that does find me. The
bulk email box seems to hover around the 1100 spam emails a month
mark, but I only get a half dozen each month or so into my regular,
and never the same one twice. I can live with that.
