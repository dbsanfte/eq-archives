My monk got tired of dungeon crawling, so I decided to run check out the pit
with my baby shammie in FoB.  I move towards the far end of the pit from the
newb ramp and start entertaining bandits, heartstrings, and various
critters.

The inevitable happens.  I get more adds than I can handle.  Rather than
train them past the newb ramp and get a bunch of even lower levels
slaughtered, I crawl up into the "desert area" and start running for the EJ
zone, shouting my intentions.  (Being very considerate, IMHO)

I zone in, heal up and med up, then step back over.

Instant barrage of quality tells such as:

"You SOB, NOBODY trains the EJ Zone!"

"U suxors, f*ck off and DIE!!!"

and a classic... "I'm petitioning your dumb ass for that train!"

I look around and their are five or six dead leezards near the zone line.

Now I may be ignorant, but why would someone in their right mind set up EJ
as the pull spot from FoB if they are so low their group can be wiped out by
a few bandits and skellies?

<shakes head and wonders off>
