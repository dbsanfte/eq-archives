*nod* Personally, for the chat-filtering capabilities alone, I'm going 
to be thrilled.  I enjoy guild chat, *and* group chat, and yet I still 
like to keep an eye on the battle spam.  It'll be nice to be able to 
watch the spam and NOT have to keep scrolling up to see who said what 
before somebody's dual-wield-double-attack-hasted-berserker attack 
kicked in *g*
