I don't have the link--I'll try to find it--but there was a funny
exchange a year or two ago.  When Sunmoon first started out Evil
Raiders (the guild name) he created a thread on the Morell Thule
message boards to recruit memebers.  He posted a message about raiding
Thurgadin to get members Belts of Dwarf Slaying.  In the following
message, he actually responded to himself with an alias, exclaiming
how great of a guild this allegedly second person had joined.  In the
third message, the board admins warned him that he is not allowed to
post under different aliases using the same IP addy.

Pathetic.

Who has the kind of money and time it takes to run 12 different
characters anyway?
