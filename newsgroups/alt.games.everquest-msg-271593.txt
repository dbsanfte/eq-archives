Well but Blizzard did? - This tells you nothing ?
Or are you saying WoW will be outdated in one year and noone will be
playing it?
My point is that SOE probably looses a lot of customers by demanding
such high requirements.
I repeat,IMHO its insane to throw out 1k Dollars just for ONE game.
And your point of Gameboys and Nintendos is not valid,or can they
do all the things I described above?
