Yeah. Unfortunately, this means that when there *is* a worthwhile quest, you
are competing with everyone else on the server for it (go to Kelethin and
listen to the Meat Cult all intone "I will hunt for meat" over and
over....). And rather than solving this "problem" by making other quests
equally worthwhile, Verant "nerfs" (for "Not Even Remotely Fair") the quest
that is getting so many people excited.

It's a strange world, our Norrath....
