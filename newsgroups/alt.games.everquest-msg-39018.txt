Are you kidding me? Everyone bitched. No one liked the insane magic
resists, the linear faction system, the 50% of zones you couldn't get
too without picking sides, the super melee mobs, the rise of the
Warrior,  and Cleric at the expense of all other classes. The bitching
could be heard for miles.  And it's obvious Verant heard because they
said their expansions would be more like Kunark from now on.

Exactly, except I think they might quit and try Daoc instead. Or AO,
or AC, with the expansion, or NWN, etc.
