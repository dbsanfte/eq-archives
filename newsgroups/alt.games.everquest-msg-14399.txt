Originally, yes. I think the word started out as something like 'r��'
and it probably still uses a thorn (�) on Iceland.

The website that pointed out to me why me getting a bard named
Metallah through the name filter was somewhat surprising? :) 
And you left out Fennin Ro... To me, it looks like the original
deities used normal creativity (did Marr come before or after
Mithaniel and Erollisi were related to Tarew, I wonder?) with Tunare
being the only rearrangement. Then they started making server names
and someone got a hold of an anagram generator :p
