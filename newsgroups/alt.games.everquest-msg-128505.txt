You should look in to one of the higher end GeForce3's or maybe a GeForce4 
that isn't MX.

You may still encounter some visual lag, so don't be too disappointed if 
you do. I found that with all Luclin graphical options on I can still get 
less than great framerates when there are many other players in the same 
screen and it's a lush environment. Also if there are many other players 
of many different races then it will slow down more than just a couple of 
races I think. Also don't overdo it on anti-aliasing. I was using 2X 
QuinCunx FSAA at first, it's almost like 4X FSAA but at less performance 
hit. Anyway, not only was some of the text more difficult to read but it 
would slow things down a bit with many players. I now use just plain ole 
2X FSAA for reduced jagged edges with barely a hit to performance. I'm not 
sure how much resolutions will affect things. I leave mine at 800x600 
because EQ still isn't very resolution friendly. Much higher and I can 
barely read the text and other stuff, I wish they'd accomodate for that.

My system specs:

AMD AthlonXP 1900+ (~1.6GHz)
512MB PC2100 RAM
GeForce4 Ti4600 128MB
75GB IBM DeskStar 75GXP (7200RPM)
     Hmm... my sound card I guess has been this onboard thing
     since I began playing EQ again. I'm still waiting on Creative's
     replacement SB Live! 5.1 to ship.
Windows XP Home
