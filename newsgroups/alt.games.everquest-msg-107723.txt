Hmm, yeah, that sounds like a good idea, though I've not had much use for DR
really, I was trying to keep wis at 200 though for general purpose hunting,
I actually never swap in the testament any more when soloing because I
prefer the ac/hp on the sarnak shield since I occasionally do get hit,
either due to lag (rarely), being trained (more common) or accidental
overpull (Grey trains are fun...).  I'm loathe to swap out cloaks for
something else mostly because of the 5 MR on the Ry'Gorr, since I'm aware
that the MR is a tad bit low (also considering a Tranix crown for the resist
setup), I've got a Kunzar cloak in the bank in the event that I do need FR
though over CR/MR.

Also keep in mind that that ac/hp is unbuffed, I always have about 10 more
ac with self buffs (the number on profile is a bit higher than normally
unbuffed), and about 250 more hp.  I also rarely get agro unless on purpose
(ie sitting after debuffing/snaring to get summoned, or agro kiting
something with a partner)  I'm also in the middle of getting the last 13
points of defense up there, which should give me another 50 or so AC.

I used to wear coldain skin gloves, but switched to the grey flesh for the
CR, at the expense of AC, would you recommend staying with the grey flesh or
switching back?

I'm also working on buying a fishbone earring or something since I'd really
like a permanent EB item other than the amulet of grey wastes that I've got
1 of 3 organs for, so that I don't have to swap out my warden symbol. (it's
also why I have a lodizal shield on my wish list )
