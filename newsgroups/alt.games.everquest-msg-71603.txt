A *really* huge log file can mess with performance.  I archive mine at about
30 megs or whenever I start to notice the "jerk" that I've learned is a
result of it being too big.

A bigger problem can be disk fragmentation.  Be sure and defragment every so
often, and download "cacheman" to set up a better way to handle Window's
protection against fragmentation.  And be sure not to leave it running.  :)
