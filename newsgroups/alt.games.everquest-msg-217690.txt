Yepper, they do!  At least Rallos and Sullon do.

Hmm, I guess I'm roleplay medium-to-hardcore.  :>  I don't speak with an
accent, either (I can't see an Iksar using "thee" and "thou" anyhow, and
few of the Iksar roleplayers are in favor of the hissy thing (it's seen
in-character has a Shissar accent, not an Iksar one, IIRC).  But I did
make a biography and background for her.  I even write stories about the
stuff she's doing.  Oh, and it certainly helps that I've been hanging
with the local Iksar-only guild, the Skathris Ven`Sho, who are very much
*into* the whole Iksar thing (and a fun bunch of people OOC, too!). 

Satrika's not a hardliner, even though she has to play the part
sometimes, in order to fit in.  I had an interesting little scene with a
random halfling druid in Kurn's.  He healed me while I was resting in
the secret room, and, after peering at him a bit, told him thank you in
Lizardman and smiled.  Of course, this is an Iksar smile, and shows lots
of pointy teeth!  He swallowed hard and was properly intimidated,
suddently worried that the scary lizard woman was going to eat him. 

Little stuff that makes the game fun for me.

One character per account actually makes a difference, I think.  That,
and the fact that the message board gets a lot of use by the players. 
Our Soapbox isn't as, um... *entertaining* as that of some server
boards, but people pay attention to it.  And with only one character per
account, you can't be an ass with one character and then retreat to your
"real" one. 

No Cats in Hats here.  There is rivalry between the biggest raiding
guilds, but there doesn't seem to be any of the nastier stuff going on
that there is on other, more populated servers.  Oh, and there are
people who roleplay even at the high end, too, which is, to me, nifty
and keen.

She must be using that "Endure Cold" buff that level 1 shamans get...
