	Well, members of my guild group outside of the guild all the time. Have 
you really done a survey and found out if anyone's grouped outside the 
guild in the last month?

	It might just be a habit thing. I mean uberguilders who have been 
raiders for six years are probably just used to doing guild-only stuff, 
and may never change. But the rest of the population is probably a bit 
more adaptable. I know I have had to be, and so would anyone with my 
history.

	If I'm grouped with mostly members from another guild I'm usually a lot 
more tolerant of strange loot behavior. On the other hand if I've 
started a guild group and filled the last two slots with downtrodden 
nobodies, I'm usually intensely aware of what we're doing with loot and 
try to ensure everything's as transparent as possible.

	That and the lack of rogues and insane monks. Even though most monks 
are at least partially insane, they're a bit rare.

	Or your 45th Takish easy collect? I wouldn't do it at all, except that 
aside from raiding grinding the same content over and over is the best 
way to upgrade.

	In the case of the tank stuff at least you're better off doing it the 
other way around, especially considering the LDoN stuff is slot types 1, 
2, and 3 whereas DoN is 7 &  9. (or 7, 9 & 12). There are a few LDoN 
augs that are slot 7, 8 or all, but no DoN slot 2 or 3 augs.

	Half of my slots used to be LDoN, and I'm down to just the BP now, with 
the points ground down into three 10AC augs.

	It's good enough to do DoN's. (I think a lot of people would complain 
if DoN gear wasn't up to doing DoN's). It's good enough to group in MPG 
by most standards. It isn't up to MPG trials or RS. At least not for a tank.

	a) vastly more people have hit the level cap and are even running out 
of good AA's to get, and are turning all of their scrutiny to gear and 
*realising* that their primary limitation is that they are not raiders.

	b) Despite the insular picture you paint, I see and group with a lot 
more raiders now than I used to in PoP. This is probably because I fall 
heavily into (a) above and also because Sony *have* done the right thing 
and reduced the segregation by zone.

	c) a lot of people who meet (a)'s criterior are becomming raiders as a 
result, and so feel they have enough knowledge of both sides to comment. 
This is my primary reasoning for talking about it now. I have *always* 
found the disparity between raider and non-raider gear disheartening, 
but now that I have some knowledge of raiding as well, I can do 
something more constructive than whining about it.

	But they're faced by mobs that quad 1200's and stuff. 2/3rds (if you've 
done 400 creators) isn't enough.

	Well it was a ghost town before and after the revamp, so on the whole I 
would have to say the revamp missed the mark somehow.

	It's actually a lot harder and more effort for me to get a group going 
with my new guild than my old one. I think organised and focused is a 
slightly misguided judgement.

	If you were a single grouper and not a three boxer, you would find 
yourself mostly soloing in KT and Yxxta when you got there. The trouble 
with grouping is that the other five dorks limit you :P

	The people who ordinarily organise raids organised the raid, and 
handed over to the epic guy once everyone was in position. When we do 
epic encounters we usually do 3-4 in a night.

	As a family guilder for some years, I did most of that crap too and the

	You're not getting me :P

	It's the best item overall - as in all things considered, including 
pulling etc.

	My example would by my crappy Omens teir1 sleeves. I wont be upgrading 
them with an item that has twice the hp and AC anytime soon because they 
have improved parry 1. That makes them the best item overall until I get 
an improved parry 2 item.

	Then they're abruptly worthless :)

	I guess I was suggesting for a moment that you look at it from the 
point of view of the people doing the 400 creators. I didn't really mean 
"does wearing gear that has 300hp per slot suit you?".

	If you ask me, getting to level 70 in shit gear is a titanic effort on 
its own. It costs these guys more to finish one DoN than it costs you. 
It takes a really, really long time to get level 70, 200 AA's and shit gear.

	Spend the same time as a raider, have hit level 70 faster (due to 
better gear and better zones) have hit 300 aa's faster than I got my 200 
(hello Plane of Fire and RSS), and be wearing gear 1.5 times as good.

	Or, spend more time as a single-grouper, and do all the insane crap you 
describe (KT, Yxxta, MPG trials, RSS with a 10k tank) and still be behind.

	I've no doubt its true that raiders on average spend more time than 
single-groupers on average. I have no problem with that. I do have a 
problem with single-groupers who spend more time than the average raider 
still being massively worse off.

	Do the 7k tanks a favor: tell every single-grouper cleric, ranger,

	Actually a tank with 150 tanking AA's and bazaar equipment would tank 
better than a time tank without them. Less hitpoints but massively 
better mitigation.

	Very few people actually understand this. Off the top of my head, CA 
and CS are 20% between them. LR and ID are 10% between them, DI and RM 
are 5% combined, SB3 is another 5%. _40%_ reduction in overall DPS. And 
I'm leaving out my various lifetap procs and their DD crits and heal 
crits, which believe me are significant.

	And before you say "where is the time tank without any tanking AA's" 
there's another SK in my guild covered in time and EP gear without (last 
I saw) a single tanking AA yet. And a few months ago, he would've been 
getting MPG groups and I would not, because I was 500hp (yes, less than 
one swing) short of the 'accepted' minimum. I have never, ever been 
asked about AA's by someone sizing me up for a pickup group. (whereast 
*most* ask for HP and AC)
