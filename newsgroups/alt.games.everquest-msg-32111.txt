"I have been leaning toward Halfling, but I'm not sure."
Halflings are absolutely suited to the life of a rogue.  They start with =
high dex and agi but avg str.  They have the skills hide and sneak =
already as was stated before.  All in all probably the best class for a =
rogue.  Since you are a newbie, I would say go with a halfling rogue =
(and stick with it till you get to 10th before you start thinking about =
giving up or not.  Problem is that most everyone who rolls up a rogue =
goes with a halfling.  I created a gnome rogue and have a lot of fun =
playing him.  The gnome is definitely not the best choice but it's not a =
bad one and I've enjoyed roleplaying a cranky little bastard of a thief. =
 Another popular choice is the barbarian since their str is so high.  =
With that high str you will get a good return on your backstab attempts. =
 Well... I hope this helps.
