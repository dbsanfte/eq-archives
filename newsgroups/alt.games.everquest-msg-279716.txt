Recently I found Bards "level quite nicely".
Some highlights from my admittly short Bard career:
3 full levels 13 to 15 in 55 minutes in Kurns.
Full level 42 in 1 hour in Dreadlands.
Both soloing.
Major disadvantage of a Bard is,you have to follow the song messages
very closely to play them efficiently,personnally it hurts my eyes
badly,leading to a headache after about an hour.
