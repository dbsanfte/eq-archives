Yes, I make heavy use of the "blanks" in spell sets (and have even
posted about them before when the topic's come up).  That's why I
mentioned how you can burn through the 10 available spell sets if
you use some for single spells that you swap in a lot.

My druid is currently using 9 spell sets, though I'll admit I don't
actually use some of them much.  There's:

(1) eight buffs (I might not always cast them all, e.g. I won't
always bother with PvD or PvP or See Invis, depending on what I
expect to be doing, but if I'm memming the STR, HP/AC, ATK, DS,
and SOW, I figure I might as well mem three more.  The DS here is
the long-lasting self-only one.

(2) typical combat spells: healing, harmony, snare, DOT, DD, invis,
and the shorter DS that I can cast on others.  I also include the
self-only ATK buff since it's a bit shorter than the other buffs so
I sometimes wait and cast it just before combat; this is also one
of the gems I often swap out if there's a single spell I need.
Note that switching from (1) to (2) doesn't actually clear/re-mem
that slot.

(3) cures: healing, cure poison, cure disease, cancel magic.  This
set I don't use much, because often if a cure is needed it's needed
quickly, so I'll manually switch one gem to whichever is needed.

(4) summon food/water: this goes with a hotkey that casts both
spells and autoinventories the stuff.  Handy when setting up, though
after a while I tired of spending time on this at the start of each
session, and began carrying "real" food and drink.

(5) practice: my lowest-mana spell of each type (Abj, etc.), for
when I'm just trying to boost my casting skills.  This set actually
uses 7 slots, since I threw in summon drink to go with the summon
food (making this a superset of (4)) so I could stock up while
practicing, and I added SOW since I'm often practicing in PoK and
I offer SOWs while I'm there.

(6) SOW: since it's my single most-asked for spell, plus one I need
to refresh on myself at odd times, I gave it its own set.

(7) kiting: I'm still experimenting with this one, but the idea is
to modify my "combat spells" set to make it more suited to kiting
rather than melee or grouping.

(8) root-rotting: likewise, I've got a set that throws in Root and
two more DOTs.

(9) gate/bind: I could probably do away with this set, or at least
remove the Bind Affinity part (so it's faster if what I want is to
mem Gate so I can get away from something).

Oh, and with regard to whoever said "*cough* EVAC *cough*" about
wizard gems, both my wizard and my druid have Crucibles of Escape
that they keep in a top inventory slot, and a hotkey tied to that
slot, so they can evac with two keystrokes (the first being to
switch to that hotkey set).  Not only does it save a gem, it also
works when I'm out of mana, which is often the case on an evac. :-)
