Agree, but now that we have lesser Evac, Qeynos isn't a problem anymore.
If you want to add a new wizzy spire, put it in the frozen,
gawdsforesaken tundra of everfrost. Something waaaay out there near the
Ice orcs so it won't be an immediate infestation of newbies on the
barbies, but would make Perma/Vox raids a lot more doable. That's a
wasted dungeon most of the time if Vox isn't up, because it's just too
damned remote.
