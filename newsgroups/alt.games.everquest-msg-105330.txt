    And this matters how? Some classes level fast - those classes tend to be
(not always - wizards are a big exception - but tend to be) the more
marginal classes in the raid picture. This is balance. Not a balance power
gamers like, as they want to get to 60 as fast as anyone else AND be as
powerful once they get there, but it is balance.

    Twinking creates imbalance. Twinking a melee's damage output is trivial
to do, and can be done to levels that are beyond ludicrous (that level 30
melee with .5 ratio one handers and an FBSS is churning out 120% the damage
that was originally intended). No such twink exists for casters - you cannot
increase a caster's damage output over the course of a gaming session with
twinking. Mana items are to casters what HP items are to melees - they
increase the safety factor, and allow them to do encounters that could
otherwise not be survived.

    Exactly.
