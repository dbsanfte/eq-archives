Hi all,
Just 2 quick questions. I have 2 chars, a lvl 19 Druid and a lvl 10 Monk.
Both chars are needing an upgrade to their weapons. The Druid uses a
Bloodforge Hammer (yes its bad but it does more damage than anything else I
have) and the Monk either uses his bare hands or a Bronze Mace.
So I was wondering what you ppls thought I should get as an upgrade for
these chars. Please suggest something that I might be able to quest for with
these chars, or purchase quite cheaply (I still need money for my lvl 24
spells).
I am thinknig about giving the Monk the Bloodforge Hammer, but the delay is
really bad. Oh, and I want him to be hunting wisps soon, so a magic weapon
would be nice.
Thanx for any advice,
Chaotica
P.S. Thanks for those who recommended I stick with the Druid, I love his new
spells.
