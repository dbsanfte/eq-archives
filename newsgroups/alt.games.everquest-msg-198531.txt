I wouldn't.

Channel a snare, run a bit, med and nuke, or DoT, or use the clicky on your
sword / armor.  You'll do more damage and have a much higher survival rate.

Then evac and start over.

What summoning mob have you ever fought where melee made a difference?   Now
you're not even talking about low blues, you're talking about post 50 mobs.
So lets see, a post 50 summoning mob that doesn't run that is weak enough a
druid can melee it?   Please, please tell me what it is.   I think my
warrior may actually be able to solo for once...

The weapon was in her off hand.  Level 15'ish, so this was immediately after
she got dual wield, the skill was low and did not go off much at all.  The
weapons were two different types, piercing in her main hand, slashing in the
off hand, so I could tell which hand was swinging at any given time (I play
with "your misses" turned on).   Only the off hand weapon had a proc.

In the middle of a string of 10 straight piercing attempts, with not even
one slash attempt, the weapon proc'ed.

The current theory is that any main hand swing brings with it a roll to
check and see if any of your weapons proc.   Hitting, missing, and in the
case of the off hand, even swinging, have no effect on the calculation.
