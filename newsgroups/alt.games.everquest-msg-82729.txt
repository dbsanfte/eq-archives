A couple of weeks after SoL released I went exploring in Shadowhaven
Library and found a NPC in the bank that wants some cash for a Faded
Painting of a Lady.  Well, I gave him the 100 gp and got the painting
out of curiosity to find that it is NO DROP. This is obviously for a
quest of some sort, does anyone have any ideas?  I appreciate any and
all responses.
