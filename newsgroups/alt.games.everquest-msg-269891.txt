I want to make the newest item available to me after my level up. But
I need an item I cannot make.

Browsing the market there a few people selling them ... for 15sp.
Seems excessive to me. I browse for the item that I want to make to
see it selling for as low as 5sp.

The inter-dependancy on other players in order to craft is not going
to work. 

Cheers,
