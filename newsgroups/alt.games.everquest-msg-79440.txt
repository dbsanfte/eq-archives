Well, yes and no.  We have several great Paladins in my guild, including 
one who probably lives real life as a Paladin, so we seem to alwasy find 
reasons for them to come along.  There are one or two Pally buffs that are 
worthwhile, but yeah, they are of limited use in general raid situations.  
We are using the DA pull a lot more now, though it's probably more trouble 
to set up correctly than other methods.  (You have to have your feigners 
go in and pull the non-AE/uber-melee mobs one direction, pally hits DA and 
pulls nasty back to group, ensure that no wanders are in pull path, etc.)
