What more could I possibly have to go on than what I've read? I've seen it 
described in *excrutiating* detail, much in an attempt to discredit my own 
views, and I see holes in all of it. I think there are several people here 
who would just rather blame it on the system than look within their own 
guild for solutions. You don't need taken care of. You don't need it made 
easier.
