Yes, and yes.

Accidents happen, to everyone.   Either through inexperience or lag.   The
vast majority of times, a two second apology ends the entire thing.   If the
mob is still alive, tell them to aggro it off you and go ahead.  If not, say
sorry and move on.  If they really throw a hissy fit over a simple mistake,
then they're not the type of player that I'm going to worry about upseting.
I know enough immature asses already... didn't need to get to know one more.

Even easier.

When in game sometime, type

/assist off

This will turn off "Auto attack on assist".

Doesn't really work this way though.   If a mob swings at you and you are not
targeted on something, it will automaticly target them.  Anyone who stumbled
over a mob would most likely have it targeted as they ran away.

Best policy is really to not interfere once another player has engaged the
mob, in any way, unless they ask for help, or you ask if they need help first.
Helping people out of the blue sounds nice... but sooner or later you're going
to hit someone pulling, or a druid who is just lining up a couple mobs to
start snaring them all...  The later on in levels you are, the more often this
is true.

Yes.  This is something that is not immediately obvious to everyone.   Mobs
are drawn at a farther range than players are... and health bars do not update
unless you are within (or close to) melee range.  Usually you can tell by how
it is behaving.   If it is usually a wanderer, but it is standing still...
it's probably fighting.   All mobs (unless static) move in a slow leisurly
walk when not engaged... if you see something really hauling ass, you can be
almost certain that someone is pulling it or kiting it.
