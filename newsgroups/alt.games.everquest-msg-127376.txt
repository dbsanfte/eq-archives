Well, so much for that theory, even the CIA isn't buying it, unless 
they're somehow getting rich off fish and natural gas. :)

Again, though, I do find it hard to accept the idea that the -only- way to 
have a thriving non-oil-based economy is to be "western"...  I mean, 
there's Japan... (or wait, did they get rich off fish once? hmm...)
