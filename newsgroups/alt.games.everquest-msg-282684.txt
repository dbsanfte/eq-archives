I think most of the enchanters just rerolled or went to WOW when it became 
clear to us that we wernt going to get out lvl 69 mez without bribing 
someone. Admittadely SOE did improve things a lot by making it our first 
spell in the series, but too little too late. I wont even start on zone 
design that came with OOW. I hear its more enchanter friendly lately, but I 
dont really care anymore.

I hope EQ works for you better than it did for me.
