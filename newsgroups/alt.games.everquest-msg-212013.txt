You'll notice SCM3.  When I got it, the difference was jaw-dropping.

I don't know how it is for druids, but clerics have some spells that suck up
mana something fierce.  When I was a level 60 cleric who could only dream of
ever seeing Vex Thal, one Blessing of Aegolism could destroy 60 percent of
my mana pool, and even individual Aego's could hurt a lot.  After getting
SCM3, the difference was amazing.  I could seemingly cast Aego all day long
and not notice.

Okay, that's an exaggeration.  =)  I also happened to get an Obulus Death
Shroud at just about the same time, so I was seeing the cumulative results
of that and SCM3.  Still, SCM3 is a *big* leap over SCM2.  It's worth
getting.  Hands down, it's the most beneficial AA you can spend as a WIS
caster.
