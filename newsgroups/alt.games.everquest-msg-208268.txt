They've changed the descriptive text for /report too.  If you are like me
and use the "always chat here" function for one chat window, and have
ooc/shout/auction/tells/channels going to other chat windows, you'll have to
turn off "always chat here" and do /report in the window you want the report
to be taken from.

Of course, if you learn this the hard way like me, and then try to correct
the report, you'll find out that you can only make one report per zone. 
Excellent programming Sony, utterly freakin asstastically excellent.
