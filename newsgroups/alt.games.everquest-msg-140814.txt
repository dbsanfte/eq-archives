   Not for me.  I can never seem to find the little bastards.  Maybe if
verant put them in bird cages so they didn't wander off...
   Though, to be perfectly honest, since I got Luclin install I don't
take the boats nearly as often as I used to.  And I suspect that this
trend will only increase when PoP is released.
