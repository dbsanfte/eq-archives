That is no longer true, and has not been for some time. We knew that, and 
used that pet.  We also tried epic pet, higher level pets, none worked.  
Basically, it's hit or miss using mage pets.  You just about guarantee 
your success by just doing it with a high FR high level tank of some 
type, and a healer for him.  More people is better.  Rangers are great, 
as they can damage outside AoE range.

If you are fighting him inside the building, which I highly recommend, 
spawn him where the black reaver spawns just inside the building on the 
entry level floor.  Place your healer(s) up against the wall with the 
door leading in, or just outside the building.  They will be outside AoE 
range, but inside healing range.  Worked to perfection every time we did 
it that way.
