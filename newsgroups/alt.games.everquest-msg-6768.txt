As will no doubt be pointed out to you much less politely than I am doing
so.  The problem is that today is patch day, and while the servers are down,
for whatever reason, the message you get is that you cannot log in due to
congestion.  Yes, I know, they should put a more informative message up, I
agree, but so what, they haven't done so, and probably won't.  When the
patching is complete on their side, you will have to download the patches to
your system, taken care of automatically for you when you start EQ, and with
ISDN, shouldn't take too long.  Then you will be able to play with the new
patches in place.  As I am always at work while this occurs, I have never
had this particular problem, and don't know exactly when they will be done,
just that they have always been done when I get home.  Be patient, and
expect a bunch of nasty replies to your question, as if your were to read
the FAQ, which may or may not be currently available to you in this NG, you
would already know the answer to this question.  And I would definately
concur with the lose the name bit.
