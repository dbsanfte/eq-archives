I'll freely admit that I have strong socialist/communist views.  Not the
type of government used by the Soviet Union which was declared to be
communism, but true communism.  Think more along the lines of the comminutes
in Israel (the name of which escapes me now -- early Alzheimer's you know),
or even the "flower child" type living situations of the 70's (without the
drug use, however).  Even something along the lines of the Amish or
Pennsylvania Dutch communities.
