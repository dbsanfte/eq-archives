Yeah. Lets see. I could go attack one monster that is blue to my
'toon. Win. And hope no other monster shows up. While I wait for my
hit points to slowly climb back up. Or go into a town and wait and
wait. Then go back out and attack another monster. Over and over.

Or, with a temp, I can go out and attack several monsters over a
period of an hour, and feel like I've accomplished something.

I would rather have a temp.

I agree, but free buffs are rare these days.

I'll think about it. But I don't have hours at a time to play
online. A temp helps me actually adventure in the short amount of
time I can play. That makes it more interesting than my spending
more time waiting for me 'toon to regain hp than I do now.
