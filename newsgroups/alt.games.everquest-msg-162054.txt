Even though this is a troll:

If you are able to read german, try http://olnigg.de/ - if you die of
laughing, hehe, not my fault.

I was in neaocron in BETA and this game was a joke, the avatars look like
they are goinng over to rob the next bank.
Searching the sewers all over for victims that were killable at that lvl was
a sport as well as countless dumpass idiots having killstealing as a life
philosophy as well as ninja looters of chests you just unlogged in the 5th
try (you can't see the enviroment during hacking).
Being stuck in those anti-gravity lifts was nice - no answers to bug-reports
as well.
Also trying to log on other Avatars, well the try of logging them in.
Zoning was a lottery - crash or no crash.
Hmm, this game NEOCRON is a must if you wanna see the 8th wonder of the
world: graffiti at the back wall of an anti-grav lift where noone - not even
the heaviest amored and armed soldier - can stand for a moment before you
are lifted to the height.

Go on to Neocron, if you like the game, but that is no reasonable way for
serious RPGer.

Just my 2 cent.

>
> * Extensive player chat/talk!  Zonewide, area, clan, personal, etc.

>

> around the game world, to other peoples houses (that you have
authorization
> to??)...  So in other words, Scott could say "Meet at my place at 10pm EST
> for Clan hunt", and at around 10pm, everyone would teleport into Scotts
> house from their own houses..  *Amazing!*
>
> * Computer terminal in your house -- where you can do everything from look
> at city maps, learn about tradeskills, read about laws, learn about
> monsters, read the guides, learn about clans(guilds), read the guild
> information and players, even apply for membership to the guild!!!!  Also,
> from these terminals, you can  see the status of the wars,check job
> postings, enter and keep track of other players, track your kills and
> information on yourself, and more!!! *HUGE*
>
> * Outfitter .. IE Replicator - each house has an outfitter in it, when
used,
> can change your character, cloths, etc... *nice*
>
> * Halo-Deck (IE Arena) - where you can setup training, matches and duels
in
> a arena type place, with various layouts!  Kinda like deathmatch levels in
> Unreal Tournament or something. -- anything that happens in these
halo-decks

>

>
> * Strong guild(clan) conflict, cooperation, and wars.
>
> * Strong Faction Content, wars, struggles for terrain and resources (clans

>
> * Excellent PvP action, with BALANCE.. Some big fights can last for 4-6

it..
