But I don't always have to win to have fun. Staying alive is fun.
Deaths usually aren't, especially when they could have easily been
avoided. A death due to simple bad luck rather than recklessness can
actually be fun, though. If it was a good fight, everyone fought
admirably, and hung on til the very end, I don't mind dying. ;p

Exactly what I'm trying to say. Extreme either way is bad.
