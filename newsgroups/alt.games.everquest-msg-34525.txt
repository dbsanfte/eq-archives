At level 14 SoW is an extremely expensive spell to cast on strangers,
assuming you're not a twink.  You're dealing with having maybe 130 WIS, and
at 40 mana it costs just a little less than 2 heals!  Yikes!  I feel for
you...I remember your pain (from 2 years ago :) ).

New paragraph, new subject...Any time that I'm at a druid ring and some
newbie (level 15 or lower) or ANY beggar looking for buffs my response is,
"Sorry, I don't buff druid ring groupies."

Well, ok, not ANY time...I said it the first time yesterday but I do intend
to start using that line more.   Yesterday when I used it the guy got huffy
and said "gimme a break, i just got ported here."  My response was "well,
you should have gotten them to buff you."  He had nothing to say to that.

Three hours later I ported back to WC.  He was there asking people to buff
him.

Another new subject...  I see nothing wrong with twinking.  I don't think it
harms the game in any way.  Of course, if they can afford to twink they can
afford to pay for a stranger's buffs.
