I dropped my shield as soon as I got the skill and bought an elder
wolfs jawbone to go with a blackened alloy longsword. But dual wield
hardly ever goes up, in fact parry, which I got the next level after
duel wield, has already passed it, and I have also put ten practice
points into duel wield. Seems an excessively slow skill to raise.

I read this before and it doesn't sound like rangers as soloers are
really feasible. You can probably do it but animals don't carry
anything of value, so I reckon a solo ranger is a pretty poor ranger.

I'm mainly interested in soloing, I hear druids are good for soloing,
might have to give one a try.
