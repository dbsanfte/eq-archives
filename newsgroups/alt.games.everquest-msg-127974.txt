I'm playing my first character right now. 12th level Halfling Druid on
Luclin server. (I know, HFL DRU is supposed to be the easiest
class/race - that's why I chose it.) Anyway, I read all thse post
about people whining about other people abusing camping... My
thoughts/theory-

Can you buff MOBs if you haven't charmed them? If I'm camping the Orcs
in Misty Thicket (I know a lot of you are used to bigger places, but
everybody's a newbie once, right?), and someone decides to snake my
camp, and I'm only camping to get the War Documents (I'm trying to
establish a way in which I had farely staked claim to a camp)... So
they steal my orcs. Can I cast Skin like Rock or Flamefist on the
Orcs, in order to prohibit them from stealing my camp?

And is this against the Play Nice Policy?

I would think that in general this would be frowned upon, but if
someone steals your camp or something... Can this be done?
