}I lost my tunic at level 1.  now level 3 monk is there any way of getting a
}monk tunic or should  I just get some cloth armour?

It is possible to get your tunic back, but probably not worthwhile.  You'd
have to create another monk character, take the note to the guildmaster,
then transfer the tunic to your main monk by dropping it near where you
camped and switching characters really fast, or convincing an ally to hold
it for you for a minute while you switch.  But the tunic's lame, and I
don't think you need it for any quests, so it's probably not worth the
effort. :)

Also, the guy who followed up talking about the Curscale armor quest and
the Haggle Baron has assumed you're an Iksar.  On the odd chance you're a
human monk, that's why you can't find these guys. :)
