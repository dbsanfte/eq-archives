WARNING:  It's wrong on so many levels to bring politics into this 
board, but 1) it's already been done, and 2) this might apply to some of 
you, and you ought to know if you don't already.  If you don't want give 
a shit about anything but EQ when you come to this board (and I 
understand that), just skip on by this post. 

The shock-effect version is:  firewalls, email encryption and virus-
scanners are effectively illegal in these states

Pennsylvania
Wyoming
Michigan
Maryland
Illinois
Delaware
Oregon
Virginia (not quite sure about VA, actually)
Colorado 
Arkansas  

pending:

Tennessee
Georgia
Massachusetts
Texas

I think I have the states right, but you can follow the link below to be 
sure.  And I do mean illegal. As in...felony-illegal.

The longer version is this...there is a bill unofficially referred to as 
S-DMCA ("Super DMCA") being pushed by the MPAA and RIAA (Motion Picture 
Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America, 
respectively) that is intended to protect against piracy.  Problem is 
that the language they use is so broad that it includes many things we 
consider a wee bit essential to sane internet usage, like firewalls and 
virus-scanners (inasmuch as firewalls conceal your virgin computer and 
maybe re-route traffic in the form of Network Address Translation -- 
allowing multiple computers behind one IP address -- and virus-scanners 
can detect trojan horses), in its list of illegal software/hardware.

Most people don't know about it (hence why it has been passed so many 
places).  And who knows if they'll really come knocking on your door to 
arrest you for using a firewall.  *shrug*  However, I imagine a few 
folks on this list are fond of their "keep out the spam and junk" 
devices, so might find this whole thing just a little eyebrow raising.

Don't take it from me though.  Visit http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/states/ 
and draw your own judgements.  Pay particular attention to the links 
under "EFF Resources on S-DMCA Legislation" if you want these 
accusations of "firewalls illegal!" explained to you.    

I'm not going to get too dramatic, but I will say that this whole thing 
makes me uneasy.  Sure, we also have laws saying it's a felony to call a 
woman a whore if she isn't a paid prostitute...and we don't usually 
enforce that one...but I know that if they get that bill anywhere near 
California I'mna kick and scream.  They will have to pry my firewall 
from my cold, dead hands.
