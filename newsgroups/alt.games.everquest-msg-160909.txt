So high?  It's true, most people won't apply reason to it.  That does not 
make it right.

}10%?  20%?  75%?

More than 50%, I'd say.  Well, or it could be less than 50%, but it's a 
majority once you count the people who go along with it just so they don't 
have to listen to the first party whine about it.  But again, that doesn't 
make it the right decision. 

}Is it really a fair statement to say that "you're
}getting less total exp guildwide"?

Yes.  As I understand it, the first thing they do is they take the exp the 
mob would have dropped, and multiply by 0.6.  0.6*exp < exp+group bonus.  
Then it gets distributed either to everyone on the raid, or to the kill 
group.  But however it's distributed, the total exp is less.

}Or is a more accurate statement
}for most guilds "a handful of specially privileged guildies are no
}longer getting bonus xp"?  Did the few folks who got plus xp on a
}regular basis go out of their way to help the handful who got minus
}xp on a regular basis to make up the difference?

In my guild, yes.  My guild goes exp grinding a fair amount, and exp grinding 
is a lot more efficient with a higher level or more AA rogue or wizard than 
it would have been with a lower level one.

}Did/do the folks who often lose xp due to their roles get special treatment 
}in some other way?

Well, we get more free rezzes. :) My exp on raids pre-pop usually about 
balanced out, since I usually was in a group that got every 10th kill or so, 
and that was just enough to balance out the rezzed deaths.  Post pop... We've 
had 3 raids and I'm down half a yellow so far, since I can't be in the raid.
