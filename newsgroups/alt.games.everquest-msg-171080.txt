Hi I am quite new to everquest, but not computer games, rpgs or computers in
general (although I am new to MMORPG).

I do not have a manual as I am using PCG 30 day trial.

Basically I am a level 12 Wood Elf Ranger, who is learning 3 trade skills at
the moment (fletching, smithing, tailoring, (61/31/10), to take advantage of
the wood elf cultural trade skills.

Anyway onto my question, I have an abilities box, which contains 6 things
like, Sneak, Forage, Sense Heading, Tracking, Etc, and I have a combat box
which also has 6 spaces (but I dont yet have 6 combat skills). But when
either of these gets full up and I have another skill I wan to use how do I
put it in the 'hotbox', whenever I have tried to change a skill it also
changes in the hotbox.

I play on the new UK server and you will find my either in butcher block
mountains, gfay or the crushbone camp, for another few levels at least.

Many thanks for any help/
