 Well... as far as propietary boxes go (Dell, Gateway, Packard Bell,
Compaq <gag>, etc, etc..) I can *always* build a better machine (with
better components, more RAM, etc.) that will be emminently upgradable 
for much, much cheaper than any of them. I've been doing it for 10 
years at least. 
 
 And it is stupifyingly easy. With all the parts on a table in front
of me I can assemble a super gaming/biz app machine in about 45 minutes
and be ready to fire it off for OS installation (unless I get the odd
part that just won't work). I've built about 25 boxes for my family,
friends and myself.

 The big purchase is the monitor and luckily you don't *need* to upgrade
a monitor that often.
