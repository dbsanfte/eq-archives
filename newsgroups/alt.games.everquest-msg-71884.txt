Yet again, you remind me that agruing about how aggro "should" be
spelled is kind of a waste of time, since it's not even a real word to
start with.
*sigh*
And I have been playing SOOOO much too much EQ that it's become part of
my language. In my mind, it's become a legitimate word, just like the
way we use "camp".
  I'm going to take a guess and say that when a mob "aggros" on you, it
has become agressive towards you, as well as possibly saying that you
have now aggrivated it. How we, as a player base, made the jump to
"aggro" I have no clue. Plus, we went on to use it equally easily as a
noun ("uh oh, I just drew aggro on Naggy"), as a verb ("Don't run in
there yet! You'll aggro the whole damn room!") and as an adjective.
("Steer wide to the left. The sonic bats have a huge aggro radius.")

We are a strange folk, no doubt about it.
