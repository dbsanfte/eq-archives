You can probably just pop the offending keys off the keyboard for
a quick fix; but you might want to think about getting an older
keyboard that doesn't have these stupid 'time savers,' at least
for use with EQ.  Check out your local computer swap meet, if you
can find one.  I'll bet you can get a nice usable model for $5.

The keyboard I'm using is an old IBM model (pre Lexmark) that
weighs about 5 pounds and has SPRINGS under each key.  I mean
this baby pushes *back* when I press a key.  I love it, and have
been using it with all my PCs for over a decade.  I'll never give
it up!  Windows thinks it's non-standard because it doesn't have
101 keys, but who cares - it works.  ;-)
