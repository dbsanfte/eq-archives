Are you on Firiona Vi?  Is it possible you bought 'Leather Boots' that had
been augmented with a non warrior aug?  Long shot but thats all I can think
of, as long as you are SURE it's really 'leather boots' and not one of
several other varieties of 'YaddaYadda leather boots'.  As others have said,
always check in game whether the item is usable by right clicking it.
