The 'pet despawns after 2 minutes' was only added when Sony found Necro's
FD'ing next to mobs which their pet could kill.  This was in the days when
pet's had aggro like players.

Necro FD's
Necro goes to work/bed
Mob spawns
Mob aggro's pet
Pet kills mob
Necro get's XP
Repeat

After they spotted that, they despawned the pet after 2 minutes.  At some
point after that, pet aggro was changed so that pets couldn't aggro mobs,
at which point the change because useless, and they've finally backed it
out.

These are all heals over time, as I understand it, not direct heals.  Mages
don't get any heals over time.  Beastlords (who also don't get any) didn't
get their spells changed either.

For some reason, most regen / heal over time spells were upped in terms of
regen rate / amount healed per tic.

I suspect they went down by 5mana per cast - not something which is going
to affect the price or their usefulness, IMO.  That was the change I saw
mentioned on the mage boards.

Major feature added in the last patch.

All characters under 5 can try the tutorial, get a charm with decent stats
and some cash.

It used to work, then they broke it so damage shield messages always went
in main chat - which is no fun on a raid with 40 people hitting a DS'ed
mob.
