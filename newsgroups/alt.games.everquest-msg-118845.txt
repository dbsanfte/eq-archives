Grachnist (sp?) the Berzerker?

Drops an axe and a belt (mithril plated girth) ?

If that's the guy, do yourself a favour and pretend you never heard the
name.

I camped him for weeks, pre-kunark, when his axe was considered uber and
belt was out of this world. Never saw a hint of him. One day post-
velious, I was running to the ore vendor in RM on a smithing run, and
bumped into him. Dropped the uber belt. Never used it, never managed to
sell it. Even considered doing the quest it's used in for the druid 1hb
that PROCS root, just for the hell of it. Heh.

No hint of a PH, I imagine just an obscenely random spawn.
