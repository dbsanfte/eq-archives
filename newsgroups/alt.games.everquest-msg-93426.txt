Actually...  Insurance only covers certain things, such as fire, earthquake
(Yes, California, one of the major insurance nightmares).  Normal failures
are not covered by insurance.  Service Contracts also go for so long, and
dependant on how the company that is doing the service contract milks you
for the kind of coverage you need, especially in a networking environment,
where you NEED 24/7 to cover your assets.  Service contracts on a yearly
basis is expensive, and sometimes, does not always cover all issues without
throwing more money into replacements.

Server class, I believe, is machines dedicated to multi-user loads, and
designed to be running 24/7 with the ability to support RAID level SCSI/SCA
based drive systems.  Whereas most people compare the prices of their high
end home computer, the ones that have the expensive video card, the
expensive sound card, the expensive monitor for the price of a server that
will have possibly more than one processor, more memory, a cheap video
card, no sound card, no monitor, but will have, probably a SCSI based RAID,
possibly a RAID 5 with 2 or 3 spare drives to mitigate possible server
failure, with decent NIC and OS to support multiuser connectivity.  Prices
for rackmount servers alone aren't cheap, and also assuming they are using
built-in RAID drive cages versus, say a localized storage system.

As for bandwidth, true, larger bandwidth, you get cheaper, but if I also
recall, there is a hammering on you as for usage costs.  The more peak
usage, the more is tacked on to your bill.

If I remember correctly, they mentioned somewhere it takes about
approximately 40 some servers to service the 150 some zones for one EQ
Server.  And speaking of leasing, I am curious on your estimation of costs
then.  As I recall, leasing means you pay more than buying outright, due to
financing.  Over a period of time, you pay more than what you would if you
cold cocked it for the whole shebang.  I just recently spent $2k on a
laptop, looked at the 'As low as' lease plan for the amount of time they
stated, calculated it out and I would end up paying $3 to $4 hundred more
if I leased on their 'As low as' monthly payments.  Also, as for the price
per server...  True...  No server you might put up would cost $15-20k.  But
then again, that is no server you have speced out for the purposes you
need.  It is possible to spec out a server that would require that much in
some cases, depending on what particular hardware is needed.  In one such
case, a datawarehouse project in my own company did have us spec out a
server, with a dual xeon processor, external raid as well as internal raid
to the tune of about $10-12k, with OS and from Dell.  Memory and Non-IDE
based RAID, as well as external RAID hit us hard.  And this was on a buy,
not lease.

Actually, refering back to something you said earlier in your post...
Service contracts are a premium.  Buying hundreds of their nice firewall
routers to insure security...  Hits in the thousands still.  Then there is
the nice little software package you can buy from them to do maintenance a
little easier, which is a 1k+ package deal.

Actually, from what I heard... The GMs aren't exactly 'hired' college kids,
persay, and it isn't exactly 45ish GMs...  More closer to 70 to 80, since
there are the ones that man the servers, then the ones who man the Chat
room, who aren't the ones, technically, manning the chat room, that I know
of, then there are the ones who manage over them.  And while you are right
about no CS person earning 50k a year, he said 'an average of', which
suggests he is averaging the low level peons with the CEO and his senior
management's salaries.

Hmmm.  Well, I had this little education with my boss when we consolidated
with another company, and was forced to trim a lot of fat.  Lines of credit
require a stable promise of budget and regular flow of cash.  This means
that on an almost day to day basis, they have to see and project how much
money they will have in the coming months, hit that target, or close to it
so that the banks will continue to extend credit to finance new ventures.
This means, by far, the subscriber pool which I was corrected about, is not
a fixed pool of people, nor a guarentee that the flow of cash is going to
be steady and constant.  While we have been using fixed numbers, we do not
know the numbers of people who are demanding refunds after the recent
fiasco of the SoL that has rendered a good number of the population
dissatisfied, especially thoses who were running on Win95.  We also do not
know the number of people who have been banned due to their own stupidity
or jackassness towards other players, which requires Verant to shut down
their account.  We also do not know how many people have opted to go with
Stormhammer/Legends server or how many paid to transfer one character to
another server.  We also do not know how many people have actually
cancelled accounts due to their own belief of what should be done to
satisfy them for their $10 accounts, or because they left due to lack of
interest or more over, due to other reasons, such as Death (Yes...  Like
all things, people do die.).  Oh, and by the way...  My company is making
profit, unfortunately, when you are part of a larger company, your profits
goes to the higher ups, and often times used to support other companies
that may not be doing well.  And in the long run, this hurts you, because
your finances are literally locked within their own structure, and subject
to their problems, not just your own.

I think you might be missing something as well.  As a programmer, it is
possible for some bugs, even cosmetic bugs, to introduce problems
unforseen, especially in the PC market where you are dealing with over 1k
possible configurations, including software conflicts.  To that end, I
point you to my nice little dilemma with Starfleet Command from Interplay.
I got the game, played it, then watched it bomb out out of the blue for no
reason.  Looked at their tech site, nothing about my problem.  Called in
tech support, their recommendation was to kill everything running in the
background and try playing it, it worked.  Then kill everything but one of
the items, try again.  It turned out that something about Download Demon
(Now known as RealDownload) caused a conflict somewhere.  Now mind you...
All the hardware I had was supported by the game.  Does this mean the
programmer is at fault cause he does not have your particular system and
did not happen to have all the nifty programs you have running in the
background to fix this bug?  No.  Does it mean the programmer is omniscient
in preventing a bug that is related to cosmetic issue?  No.

Also, remember...  It is possible for 'cosmetic' bugs to lead to
corruption, memory leaks or crashing issues.  Some tweaks do affect how
other things work, due to how one bit of code expects to find something at
a certain location, but when the memory model changes due to a small
change, another part of the code could break down, especially when dealing
with over 5 different kind of subsystems that want ot handle one thing
differently.  But then, if you were a programmer, you would also know that
as well.

Actually, from my own view of your response...  There are a few things you
seem to be equating that doesn't all add up in some areas.  In one point,
you either misread his statement or just didn't bother reading at all.  You
also made the above statement of 'if you were a programmer', claiming that
the programmer's first job should be to fix the leaks and the crashes, yet
ignore the fact that the PC environment is not a 100% standard environment.
You also ignored the fact that it is possible, even for a supported system,
that other factors could create issues that are unforseen.  And while it
may not happen for you in some cases, it does happen to other people.

You also suggested that no server costs $15-$20k, and people would lease,
not buy.  However, you proved a point in something that would justify a
monthly cost, as Leasing tends to be, overall, more expensive than buying,
I stated a case where it is possible for a server to cost more than $10k
for a business practical purpose, and it may not be as much as they need
for an EQ server, but given we both do not know what is required to run
said zones, we may never know if your cost estimate of a machine required
is correct or if the original poster you are responding to might be
correct.

Lastly, you state things about how banks do lending, and while I admit, I
am no finacial genius, what little was explained to me by my own boss, and
being in an almost similar environment that Verant is in, (IE: A company
that is part of a group of companies) that the company's profits do go to
the higher ups to bail out other companies in a group.  Banks will require
a stable budget where your marks hit close to your predictions, and if you
don't hit close to your predictions, you might have a hard time keeping
your line of credit.  Said line of credit is needed for future endevours
and plans, much like the plan of having Legends hitting on February, then
finding out your Shadows of Luclin created unforseened problems.

Problem is...  Your example is a poor one to begin with versus the problems
in Everquest.  Some problems actually link into other problems.  Your
'cosmetic' bug, the one you think is a low priority, might actually be
causing the very problems in the client that you are pitching a fit about,
because of unforseened changes introduced by how the client and how the
drivers interact along with whatever little programs may be running in the
background.  And while you may have the brains to figure out the priorities
in your problem, do you have the brains to track down the solitary bug that
creates issues for one user, but not for others, given that not every user
has the same video card, the same OS, the same sound card, the same little
apps running in the background, the same network card or the same drivers
for each little thing.  Oh, wait... Sorry... This assumes you are
omniscient.  Unfortunately, human beings are NOT omniscient, nor do they
have access to anyone elses' brain when it comes to why they programmed
something the way they did.

Thank god you aren't one either...  From the sound of things, you might not
be able to fix things either.  BTW, sure, fixing the gnome sitting properly
may not have been a mission critical bug... But then again, noticing the
problems with the faction message being messed up in the recent patch, the
need for an emergency patch that the patch created (Which didn't seem
related to the faction misreport)...  While you may go 'Poor customer
service issue', others might actually say the same if some of the little
things weren't fixed either.  The crashing issue is an ongoing thing, and
while you believe it is poor customer service, the problem is, the bugs for
crashing are numerous and some of the 'cosmetic' issues are easy to solve.

Someday...  You should ask a GM how many bugs they probably get reported a
week.  You might actually get an idea of how many bugs are out there other
than just what you think is there.  And while you are at it, you are more
than welcome to try and fix it if you believe you can do better.  I am
sorry, but when you write like that, it smacks of elitism or worse,
uninformed expectations.  In fact...  You sound like the person who sent me
the following: 'If you re-build my system, please try to preserve the Canon
digital camera software.'  A person in my company, who has the Creative
Playcenter 2 and this Canon Digital camera software installed on her
computer, complaining about crashing problems, and our only other option is
to rebuild it from scratch telling me to 'try to preserve the Canon digital
camera software.'  That is uninformed expectation.
