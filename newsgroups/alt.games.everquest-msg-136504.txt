Look into the possibility of purchasing Norton Ghost or a similar program and,
after reinstalling windows and the rest of your normal software, make a ghost
image of the drive and back it up to cd.  That way next time you think you need
a clean install, just back up any data you need and restore the ghost image.
Personally I put windows and the main programs I use on the boot drive and
anything else I install on separate drives, as well as saving files to the
non-boot drives.
