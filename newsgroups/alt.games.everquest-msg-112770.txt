Ohhh, not just drama, but outfitting the MA first.  That seems to be a
guaranteed way to ensure drama.  Nothing like getting your MA all
decked out in ToV armor, and an epic, and having them suddenly leave
the guild and immediately show up wearing an uberguild tag.  
It is a fast way to get one well-geared tank up front, but it seems to
either lead to rampant egoitis or even worse, burnout.  We learned the
lesson the hard way several times.  (We lost 4 warriors within days of
either epic or full ToV, three to burnout, one to desire to be uber.
We also lost our first true MA to RL, but he's slain that monster and
is back this week.)
