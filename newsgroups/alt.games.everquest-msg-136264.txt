Did he??

All I got from him was that their attacks match my victim mentality.

I wouldn't put too much stock in what he says anyways..  He also said
that I "appear to have done some research into this and didn't just
jump on the bandwagon" or words to that effect..

Look at him now...

That's because you only see what you want to see.  The points are
there, plain as day...

The onus???  :^)  In fact he did..  :^)

And only when debating someone who is so ambigious that their words
can be interpreted as anything.

Even not being sure is ridiculous.  Everyone else understood it just
fine.. Nice try, but you will have to do better.

Really??

On the one hand she says that she tells her children to be nice and
don't cap on people..   Does she practice what she preaches??  Nope.

On the one hand she says that I don't know her enough to judge her as
this or that.  Yet she turns around and calls me all sorts of names as
if she knows anything about me.

Would you like additional examples??  Or are you sufficiently
spanked??

Nice tap dance...

So, if I were to say, "Complete and utter fools like you" you wouldn't
take that to mean I thought you a complete and utter fool???

You see what I mean by ambigious??  BS says something that everyone
knows what he means, but said in such a way that, when he is called on
it, he can say "Well I didn't mean THAT!!"....

It shows a debating cowardice that is obvious..

You already have perfect examples of that in BS's posts...  When I
make a statement, I take a stand.  If I am shown evidence that I am
wrong (evidence, not the mealy-mouthed whinings of the loony left PC)
than I admit I am wrong.  As I have done so.

On the other hand, BS et al makes arguments that, when you get really
nit-picky, can be twisted to mean anything.  That way they NEVER have
to admit they are wrong.  They simply accuse the opposing debater that
he/she misunderstood their words..

Seems to me a coward's way to debate, but if that is what he is
into... oh well.. his loss.

Nice try.. But lame..   :^)
