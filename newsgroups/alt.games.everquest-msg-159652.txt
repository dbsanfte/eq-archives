Ideal Business Model:  Create a product that a customer must pay for on a
subscription like basis.  I.e. create a product where 500,000 accounts pay
12.95 every month over as many years as they play.

Verant stumbled across the perfect model, one that Start ups all over god's
green earth had been trying to do and Verant happens to have the product
where that model will fall into their laps.  Sony (is a pretty sharply run
business folks, don't think for a minute that they would let their name be
tied to something if they weren't able to keep everyone on a short leash) is
sure as hell not going to let Verant drop a product that makes just under 6
and a half milllion a month.

Those that spouse that the sky is falling aren't looking at the road that
lays before them.
