No indeed, shitsack. He wasn't asking any of the other people that
piped up either. In fact, no one asked anything at all about if a
druid should or should not be in melee. The topic sprang up
spontaneously.

Then you need to learn how to operate your newsreader, because you
certainly seemed to be replying to my post and quoting my words.

Can you read dipshit? The original poster was asking what kind of
necklace to wear.

Get your own lines Bizbee - the ones you borrow from your mom are kind
of dated.

It's a pity that you weren't able to figure out what the sub-thread
was actually about before you felt compelled to spew your usual
nonsense.

What kind of fucking moron would read them all if it bothered him?
What kind of stunning cretin would wade through a huge thread for no
other purpose than so he could complain about it?

Well, Bizbee would. He doesn't have *quite* enough to bitch about
right now, because his usual group of little parasites aren't hanging
around to keep him busy.


Fuck me.
