The OP has been playing wizard for 3 years, so you are the wiz n00b, not
him. He is one of the best duo friends i have, very tactical and also an
officer in an ubah guild. Ofcourse, at higher levels, you get manaburns,
which are effective on raids, but the game isnt solely about manaburning.
Its the complete adventure of 1-60 and on... this is what lacks at lower
levels.
