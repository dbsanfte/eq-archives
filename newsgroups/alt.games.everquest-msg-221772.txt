I have a  Paladin and he has solo'd his way to level 56 (soon to be 57). He is
pretty well equipped now and has very little down time. Gets a KEI before going
into battle and uses 1hs, bash plus his few dd spells.
Mana is rarely used for heals. He has a Deepwater BP which he uses to quickly
recover HP's after a fight. Normally he can kill dark blues without trouble but
if a fight is not going his way he can cast instill to root the mob, drop back
and use his Deepwater BP to quickly restore 1800-2400 hp's then finish the mob
off.In a real emergency he can lay hands.
