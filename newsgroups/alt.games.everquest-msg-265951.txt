And that statement veritably proves that you havent played EITHER game in to 
the high levels. The grind in AC at the higher levels makes the grind in EQ 
Look like a freaking picnic.  Not to mention the endlessly monotonous 
tactics of Pull a mob run away when the whole clan comes, peg pulled mob to 
keep its attention and finally get it solo when its buddies get bored. 
Yeah... lots of fun there...
At least with EQ you have to exercise some tactics in even the most basic of 
exp groups.

nono.. go right ahead and keep thinking what you will, and Ill keep laughing 
at you for the fool you are.
