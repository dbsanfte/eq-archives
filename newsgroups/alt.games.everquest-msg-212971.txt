Yes, I know, and I used this method all the time with my shaman, enchanter, and
mage, and even to some extent with my cleric (UHOF is an old favorite of mine,
although apparantly 250 mana was still too much for most cleric's taste), the
shaman and cleric both on mounts lots of the time, never had any problem.  So
what I'm asking is, did anyone have this problem of being unable to target their
pets via f1 f1 (or heck, anyone elses pet, did you know that f2 f2 gets your
first groupmate's pet, f3 f3, f4 f4 f5 f5 and f6 f6 respectively for the rest of
them)
