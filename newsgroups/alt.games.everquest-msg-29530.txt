That depends doesn't it? If you married a reasonably normal person who 
turned into a 16+ hours a day EQ freak, you'd have grounds for blaming 
the game for your problems.

Personally, I rarely play more than ten hours a week and never when my 
girlfriend is around. It's just a game after all and while it's quite 
addictive it can be very boring as well.
