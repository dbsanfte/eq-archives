How about Half Orcs?

Half Orcs would be a real interesting class to play. Kinda Orcy -
fully hated. Good Orc faction, maybe NPC healable just like thier full
Orc buddies?

Perhaps with Regen and some enhanced melee abilities. Good giant
faction, optimized for warrior, shaman, and rogue classes. Give them
some beginning skill the other race/class combinations dont get...
