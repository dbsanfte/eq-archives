My extra 10 bucks also got me velious spell drops in Fungusgrove that
were dropping like rain. Two spells to a MoB at times. :-)

With each patch we've noticed they drop less and less. No more double
drops BTW.

That's why I don't mind paying more. I know how the game works, it's
been this way since Kunark as far as price drops on the software and
item drops through the first few weeks in the new expansion. You just
have to decide which is more important to you; the 10 bucks or getting
in early before the nerfs hit. I make a comfortable living so the 10
bucks is nothing worth whining over. I have had more spell drops in
Luclin in a single day then I had in Kunark since I've owned it and I
chose to wait on the Kunark expansion.
