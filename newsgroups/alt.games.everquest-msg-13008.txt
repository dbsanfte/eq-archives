My half elf rogue speaks with a bit of a french accent...

course he's a womanizer and a romantic.... henceforth the name of "Marcel".
:)

Been seriously considering his surname to be "Marceau"... but I dunno... :)

I remember I got him from 11-20 just by being "friendly" with all the female
druids, shaman's and cleric's I came across and they soon fell in love with
Marcel and buffed him up. ;)
