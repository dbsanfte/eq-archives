Well, I find solo mobs in most parts of Antonica, where in particular 
depends on your level.

I have been spending most of my time crafting and levelling to 20 so I 
could start on my AQ quests, so have not done a huge number of quests 
lately, just too lazy to search around for them.

There are a variety of collection quests that exist in most zones.  There 
are wholesaler tasks which do not generally require any fighting at all, 
just access to the appropriate tier zones, and high enough harvesting 
skills.  There are at least a couple of quests in Thundering Steppes that 
require killing mobs that you can find either solo or group tagged.  That 
is just off the top of my head.
