LOL... Nice to know I'm not the only slightly unballanced one out there...
Get a few more, and we can cut an album!

"I Heard It At The Zoneline"
"Newbie Q"
"Green[blood] River"
"Who'll Stop The Train"
"Up Around Kaladim"
"Have You Ever Seen the Plane"
"Dark Elf Rising"
and of course,
"I Put a Spell on You"
