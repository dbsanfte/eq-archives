Shadowbane has been my alt-EQ game for a couple months. Nice
race/skill/class/discipline development. World is fresh since there aren't
premarked maps. PvP wars; good group adventuring. Not as deep in controls
and options as EQ, but very fun. I think there's a free ten-day trial
download on their site (www.shadowbane.com ? I think). My two cents.
