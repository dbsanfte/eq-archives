They handled this nicely in DAoC.  Quest drops are separate from regular
loot.  If the quest loot drops, everyone in the group doing the quest gets
the item, straight into their inventory.

So, if you need to kill a rare spawn for a quest item, and you see 3 other
people running around looking for it--you all simply group up, and you all
get the item, instead of having to figure out who is going to get it, and
who gets to wait for the next spawn or longer.

I hate killing easy greens for faction.  When I've done something enough
times to prove that I've totally mastered it, I don't want to keep doing it,
unless it is inherently fun.  Killing easy greens is not inherently fun.
