Yep 2hs is the way to go for a pally/sk you can get a BABS Blackened Alloy
Bastard Sword for less than 200pp just because it looks like crap but with a
24dm 39dl and 2wt and it is a light source you will be smacking around mobs
and killing them almost two times faster than using a shield and a sporial
defenders blade or even a ghoulbane. Get that raised ASAP! But keep that
Bash up too.
