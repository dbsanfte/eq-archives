rangers at high levels definitely.  My buddy (65 ranger with
archery mastery 3 and endless quiver) hits WAY more keys than
I'd have to in order to play a bard (with properly set up
hot keys).

The reason is that his best DPS is based on a bow, and there
is no autoattack on ranged attacks, so you have to hit the
key every time it un-greys.

He has a 32dam/38 delay bow (Twisted longbow?  something like
that).  He has his swiftwind (40 percent haste) and a fleeting
quiver (20percent haste for a bow) and usually some form of
spell haste (yesterday it was 65 shaman haste).  So he pretty
much caps his haste on his bow pretty easily.  That's over
100% haste, or 50% lower delay.  So he has to hit the ranged
attack button every 1.9 seconds.

For a bard with a good macro setup (for each song you're twisting
you have a hotkey with
/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast #
so you only need to hit one key to stop the last song and start
the next) you hit a new key every 3.3 or so seconds.

After 3 hours of keeping BC clear yesterday (Back Cave in Plane
of Valor) he was taking breaks by jumping into melee (where
he could hit auto-attack and just have to hit keys for kick and
his spells.)  Told me his hands were REALLY tired.

Remember he's also doing a lot of running around (our puller) and
casting spells when he's not just pumping out arrows.  Much harder
than a mage -

Assist
Position Pet
/pet attack
Nuke (6sec cast)
Staff Nuke (13.5sec cast)
Nuke
Staff Nuke
Nuke
Staff Nuke

Mob is usually running by now.

This is in a perfect group where the non MA melee's aren't working
the side of the mob and rotating it around the F#$@ing MA, moving
my pet off the back and pinning the mob in a wall (taking away archery
for my buddy). (yes that bothers me, having been in groups with
very skilled melees and seeing how it can be done)

In more usual groups I switch from water to air and reposition him
on a regular basis to force mobs away from walls so my buddy doesn't
lose the ability to use his bow.  Because my staff has a bolt as the
effect I also lose the ability to use it in groups like this.  In
groups like this I do quite a bit of manuevering - in order to position
a pet you move to a spot so that a line drawn between you and your
pet intersects where you want him to be, then /pet back off and /pet
attack just as he reaches that spot.  You also need to know the path
he might take from a spot to the mob, I can put him REALLY close to
a wall and work the mob away from it if I stand far enough down the
wall, because the pet goes to the wall first, then down to the mob,
giving it a bit of angle away from the wall while it attacks.  Still
not as much concentration as a bard, but there's a distinct difference
in my contribution if I'm paying 100 percent attention vs. just
going through the motions (Assist, /pet attack, wait a bit, Nuke,
wait a bit, Nuke - hang out until the mob dies)
