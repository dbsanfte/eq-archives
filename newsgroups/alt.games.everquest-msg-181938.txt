Ah, that explains something.  The other day I mentioned that all the newbies
seemed to be missing when I came back to the game.  They weren't around the
newbie zones in GFay and Butcherblock.  Somebody said they were all in
Paludal.  That's only two zones away from the Bazaar.  Go figure.  Must be
the closest newbie area to the Bazaar, though with PoP, I don't see that it
matters much.  Everything is close now.

Cheers,
Eric
