> Second, refering to OE as a "real newsreader" is either comic or tragic.

I can't tell what newsreader you have, but OE and Agent are the 2 big ones,
so I'll assume you're using Agent.

Unfortunately Agent is no more a "real newsreader" than OE.  It's got some
seriously annoying peccadilloes that they have zero intention of ever doing
anything about (last I checked about 6 months ago, anyway...but then again,
Agent of 6 months ago was Agent of 3 - 5 years ago, so that's not saying a
whole lot in support of upgrades).

Show me a BETTER newsreader for Windows and I'll switch to it.  Until then
it's simply OPINION that Agent is a "real" newsreader and OE isn't.
