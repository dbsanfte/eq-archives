Don't sweat it. I was 17 with my druid before I did a "Doh!" and headed
back to the trainer. Not for Dodge - I slapped a point into that the
moment I dinged 15. Nope. Mine was much much worse. I couldn't understand
why my luck was so awful - I never seemed to "recover concentration and
continue casting".

That's right. I was 17 when the light finally dawned and I put my first
point into Channeling. I feel so... dumb. ;-)
