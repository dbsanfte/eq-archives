Congrats on a rare item, lousy stats and all.  My shaman got one and
will never trade it, although I only carry it to guild social events.

When my brother-in-law started a barbarian shaman I immediately told
him about the quest to Qeynos the gets you a Tribunal-only necklace.
The necklace summons a better (but no rent) magical hammer.  I didn't
find out about the necklace quest until my shaman was in his 20's and
had long since retired the Gavel o' Justice from combat use.
