Thanks.  I just ran my numbers and I'm doing about 18.5hp/sec without my 
epic haste, and about 29.5hp/sec with my haste.  Hmmm, if my numbers are 
correct, I can do over 55hp/sec damage or over 3300hp/minute.  I'm 
thinking that I may want to start duoing with a shammy now for my exp 
days.  (If it's just two of us I can twist in manasong too, since lag 
won't be bad.)  How much dam/sec is a well-equipped level 60 monk dishing 
out?
