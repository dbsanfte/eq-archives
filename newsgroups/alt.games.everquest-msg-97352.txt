It's probably because of my screen size and security settings (no
activeX and such since that stuff annoys me), but magelo profiles have
never, ever looked good or shown any useful info on my computer. Best
case is I get images of how someone's items look in their inventory
and some text about their stats scribbled over these images, and no
way to see what item the images actually depict. So, I won't be making
a profile myself.
