first, let me tell you that I changed NOTHING.
tried to log in, select my character, get the loading screen. screen 
goes black. then everquest crashes to desktop.
I couldn't figure out what was causing it, as I changed nothing.
uninstalled, reinstalled EQ, replaced my options files. same thing.
formatted hard drive, reinstalled OS. reinstalled EQ. did not replace 
options files.
EQ loads fine. but when I try to change the resolution beyond 640x480, 
it crashes again. 

running windows 2000 with a diamond ultra v770 video card that shows up 
as a Riva TNT2 in device manager due to lack of windows 2000 drivers by 
the manufacturer (though this has never been a problem before)
haven't installed my sound card drivers yet, and if EQ runs fine, I may 
not. the drivers that are currently installed seem to be fine for now.

any other information needed, please let me know.

I'd really like to be able to play in better than 640x480.
I've been working on it since about 3 o'clock this afternoon, too.
had the day off from work and had plans to play EQ all day after the 
servers came back up...that obviously didn't happen.
