hum hom.....but wud such an uninterested individual play a game that long?
or even take on the hard work askin in a newsgroup?
bottom line is: if u play a char to the 40ies in EQ u have to start asking
questions about equipment, quests, skills and spells........and u will do
that either in game to one high lvl of ur class (happens a lot:
newbcleric_001 tells you: would u be able to answer some questions regarding
our class spells and equipment plz? i try to take the time to answer it all)
or by reading websites.
such players at least know how to play their class! since they learned it
from lvl1. the REAL DANGER comes from those that have seen another class in
action, BUY themselves a high lvl of that class and think they know all bout
it and thus run whole groups and raids into hour long CRs :p
