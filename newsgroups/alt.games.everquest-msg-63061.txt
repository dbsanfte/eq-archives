It takes a staggering level of incompetance to do that poorly in Fear. Its
definately more difficult than say, left moat in KC, but with 3-4 groups of
reasonably leveled people, it should be pretty trivial. Possibly they went
off of an old zone guide, where a north wall camp spot was the best
place...in which case I would fully expect them to badly wipe out and take
a long time recovering. Wipeouts are common in raid situations. No matter
how good you are, sometimes you WILL get creamed. But 9 hours is very
extreme.

Some people do, some don't. Being in a powerguild generally requires a
substantial time investment on a per-day basis. You can't hunt in North ToV
on 2 hours a day.
