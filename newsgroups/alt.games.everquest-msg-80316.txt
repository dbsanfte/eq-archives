Fred, I guess I never asked you, or knew, where you started at. Are you in
Kelethin? I think i recall that you said you were... OMG that zone SUCKS!. I
just started a ranger there and *immediately* ran her over to Butcherblock
to the boat to FP. Number 1) there are far too many people in Kelethin.
Number 2) Freeport, however badly it sucks, sucks MUCH less than Kelethin.
Number 3) When you reach 5-6, you can always go to Ecommons and kill stuff
there, without a lot of contending for that one lone bat. Yes, eventually
you will have to go back to Kelethin, but not anytime soon, as long as
you've put your points to good use. You should be able to Track, and to
Forage and also have Sense Heading... and sh*t, I forget the others at low
level, but from what I, personally, have experienced, you have no need to go
back to train for several levels. And the competition isn't as bad in
Freeport and ECommons. I'm not sure where the closest Ranger guild is to
that point, though I am not afraid of that... I know I'll be able to train
somewhere close, even if I have to take the boat back to BB. The next thing
you have to put a point into, if you're a Ranger, is Kick. After that, you
have several lvls where you really don't -have- to do anything else, to my
mind, except kill stuff, like every other lvl ingame. I do try to keep my
skills maxed out, but I find that the least painful way is just to play,
using all the skills that my god gave me.

I'm not trying to steer you wrong... these are only some things that I,
myself, have observed. Hopefully if I'm in error someone else with more
wisdom will step in and correct me.

I wish you good hunting.
Darklet
