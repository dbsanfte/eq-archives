That, or you need to figure out what you are saying and stop trying to 
build waffle wiggle room into your arguments. Regardless, you are obviously 
talking out your ass about things you know little or nothing about. Have 
you read Sec 17 of the USC? How about the Berne Convention? The DMCA?

Let's simplify this for you by snipping superfluous crap.

"The fact that Sony doesn't enforce their "copyright" by serving the mass-
sellers with lawsuits is an implicit surrender and/or devaluation of any 
claim of "copyright" they may have in the future."

No we see that you are trying to say that a copyright can be "devalued" or 
"surrendered" in such a fashion, which is simply Not True. Copyrights are 
not legally "devalued", nor are they nulled just because you didn't run 
right out and sue someone over it. Otherwise, Mickey Mouse would be on 
every kids product from here to timbuktu, given that many people over they 
years have drawn pictures of him and not been sued by Disney. 

I may be/might be/am/could be right/wrong/off-topic/lame for 
suggesting/demanding/wanting/flaming you for this/that/the other thing.
