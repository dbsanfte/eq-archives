WOW, i had no idea dx 8.0 was actually supported now under linux.
Coming along, coming along! Course kind of a problem though, if they
ever get it to work it will cost money yet everyone (like myself)
playing EQ already is doing so on a win OS. I'd only play it under
linux and pay 20 bucks or so for transgamings thingie if it ran better
(and in all liklihood it would run worse) It could get a lot of pro
linux people playing, but I'm almost sure that verant would somehow
break it by making EQ only run if it detected a windows OS running or
perhaps other criteria (or do a quick check for linux processes
running or something)

Verant just doesn't want this to run in linux because they only want
you to be able to play full screen under windows even since they have
severe hacker paranoia.
