I have only had bad experiences with enchanters, they may be able to mes
mobs, which would be cool, but the encs I have grouped with have a tendency
to go postal when you attack the mob they mes'ed. Unfortunately, saying "I
have mes'ed a dervish, don't attack it" when you are being attacked by 4 of
the bleeders doesn't help.

"You hit the wrong ship!"
    "It wasn't my fault!"
"Well, then whose fault was it, the torpedo's?"
