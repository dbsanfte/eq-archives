Better having a spell not work, than have a spell that crashed zones.

nToV last night was a rush LOL! 
You have gone LD...
You have logged back on into a fully repopped Aary lair
LOADING...PLEASE WAIT...

We killed Eashen and Ikitar a total of 5 times each (well, technically 4
for Ik, zone crashed after he'd enraged) in between patches, and managed
to get to Vyemm as server after server was taken down for the e-patch.
The 15 minute warning came just as the monks were pulling Vyemm guards -
luckily our monks can be pretty good when they want to be and we got a
clean pull. Time was ticking as we got Vyemm into camp. Wham, Bam, he
died with few casualties. Res the dead, pass out the loot, punt to zone,
camp for the e-patch. What a rush hehe
