 3 person minimum to get an instance in DS, I'm pretty sure you can
drop down to one or two after that to actually do the instance. Their
level is dependent on the level of the person getting the instance,
not sure what the minimum is. 

There are instances in other zoned (ruined city, MPG) but no need to
worry about those at your level. It will be a while before you can
handle those even in a full group.

Not directly, all zones aren't off of DS although you do have to go
through there to reach all of the other zones. There are two druid
port spells available to shorten the trip. Not sure if any of the
zones have level limits.

Baring someone training to zone, you should be safe.

Standard zones with normal zone lines, at least till you get to MPG.

You'll be tied to no more than 4 of the OoW zones at your level,
Dranik's, Harbringer's, Noble's Causeway and the Bloodfields (along
with the instances in Dranik's) but I'm sure you can find at least a
couple of upgrades for your duo in any of those zones.
