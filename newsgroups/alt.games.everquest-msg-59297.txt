As an Erudite, I wish I had.  There's tons of int gear out there, so by level 45
everyone who want to have 200 int has 200 int.  I have 200 int at level 41, and
most of my gear is more like level 30.  I've found only one item I could wear
(i.e. neither junk nor way beyond my means) that buffs sta.  Str is good for
hauling stuff, but only int and sta will add to your mana pool and make you more
effective.
