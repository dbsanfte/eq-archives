The funny thing is, of course, that two weeks ago, so was Everquest 2.
It is now much less stable than it's been as long as I've been in the
beta (a month and a half).  They've solved the horrid lag in the big
outdoor zones, but they've broken tons of other things that probably
should have waited until after release (though "nerfing" things like
tradeskill supplies after release might not have been received well).
Hopefully they can fix the most serious of the bug before release, but
it's not looking good.

I'll still probably be playing as soon as I get the game, since I'm
expecting it will still be enjoyable, but I'd prefer it if they had
waited a month.  Of course then we'd probably just have this frantic
activity a month later...
