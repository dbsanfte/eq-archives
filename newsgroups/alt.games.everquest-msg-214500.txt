Log in in Lavastorm, no message, Teapray told me that LDoN was live (see how
much of a box I'm living in?  I'm so busy making swords that I'm not even
aware its expansion release day!) so I gate to POK, where I get the "go to
your hometown" message.  Stone to Steamfont LD.  Log in, run to AkAnon, LD,
log back in, get message to see someone... with incorrect instructions, which
tell me to go the wrong way from a place thats not on the LOY map.  After
hunting around for a while I find the place in the POP release book, but as I
said, the directions were wrong from there anyway.  I was about to give up,
about half an hour later, and log out, log in to Morel Thule server on my
bard, and use Track to find the NPC I'm supposed to look for, then log back
to FV and my mage and grumble about yet another quest thats designed around
tracking, when someone logs in their gnome and shows me where the guy is.
OK, talk to him, then gate to POK, LD, log in, zone to Felwithe, run to BB,
LD, log in, wander around briefly and find the wayfarer camp and the NPC for
the stone.  Elapsed time about an hour, due to LDs and to wrong directions...
but it would have been a good deal longer if I hadn't been told roughly where
a wayfarer camp was, the information didn't seem to be in the text the AkAnon
NPC spewed out, he just named some people I could talk to, no clues.

So I'd guess about 3 hours to do the quest if you didn't have outside help,
and thats without the continuous LDs.

They do like to have you run quests, might be something about the name of the
game.
