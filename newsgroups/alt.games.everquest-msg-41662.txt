if you had bothered to read all of her posts on this you would find she was much
more shocked horrified etc by all this than you try to paint her.  She simply
stated that America should stop trying to look like we are doing what ever
reaction we take to this for the good of the world.  I know that's not the words
she used, i am providing you with the readers digest condensed version.  I do
think to some extent that this was more than just an attack on america, but an
attack on many of the things america stands for, However and reactionary
measures we take are strictly for  the justice and vengence that Americans
seek.  I know that there is a reason the buildings in New York are called the
WORLD trade center.  It's not just americans who died in that attack, However it
does represent capitalism at its finest.
