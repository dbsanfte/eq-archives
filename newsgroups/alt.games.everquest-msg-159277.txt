If it means anything, I've cast Calm on maybe half a dozen different
MOBs in the last few weeks and it hasn't been resisted yet.
However, most of those were greens.

My understanding is that the Lull line is still sometimes resisted,
but that resists have been modified to make them more effective.
It's still a line where you want to keep an escape route handy,
but it's no longer the guarantee of instant death that it used to be.
AFAIK resists still cause aggro.
