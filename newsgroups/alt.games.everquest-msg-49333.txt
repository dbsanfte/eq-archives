I read lots of books myself, pure escapism. Been reading almost
exclusively military thrillers lately, but my normal is sci-fi and
fantasy.

On top of that, I take a programming manual to bed almost every night,
and usually spend an hour reading before dropping off.

No no no. It's "Don't waste your time watching TV when it's broadcast.
Tape it so you can watch it later and FF through the commercials".
