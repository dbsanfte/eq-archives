Don't bother buying bandages until you're making enough money to cover 
them.  Trust me, very quickly, they're going to be cheap.  Then, start 
buying stacks and stacks of em - I keep 8-10 stacks on me, and bandage 
yourself and anybody else you see around you that's below half health.  
If you're in a group with a mage and they ask if anybody needs anything 
summoned - ask for bandages. ;p (And put them in higher slots than the 
ones you've purchased, because they're no rent and will disappear when 
you camp)  My level 16 rogue can bandage for about 3% health.  Oh, and 
here's a tip - if you have any items that add HP, remove them.  Bandage.  
Now put the items back on.  Voila, you've just bandaged to over 50%. ;p  
I take off 2 items and can get back to 57 or 58% that way.
