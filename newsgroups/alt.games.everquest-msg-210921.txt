Ditto.. we had 12 full groups and had this happen Tues night on Ayonae
just before we engaged the Behemoth.  Totally screwed up the raid.  Of
course, the GMs said nothing could be done.  Needless to say, as it
was a pickup raid with many people needing the flag, many were
extremely pissed.  It's not like us folks in the smaller guilds get a
chance at this often.
