The short answer:  It probably won't.

GoD gives the highend players a new playground, which should at least
slightly ease the population pressure.  That hardly creates a need for
a new server.

Probable translation of their announcement:
"We leased this shiny new hardware for the GoD beta server, and when
90% of the players signed up for beta left upon discovering that they
were not allowed to go wandering through PoP and prior expansions with
beta-buffed characters we tried the goofy PvP server, but that didn't
use up all the hardware either, and nothing's broken right now, and
we've got to make the lease payments anyways, so hey, what the hell,
let's just make a new server and open it up for transfers, maybe that
way it'll pay for itself."

Or something like that.  Now, despite DT's unwarranted presumptions
to the contrary, I do not begrudge SOE their profit on the game.  If
they weren't making decent money on it, it wouldn't be there for us
to play.  That did not, however, prevent me from hoping that they
had decided to put up a new non-transfer server, or at the least an
interesting new special rules server.  Sadly, that is not the case.
