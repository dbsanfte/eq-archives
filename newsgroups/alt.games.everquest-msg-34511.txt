Reguarding the bolt spell, if you target yourself in an open area and cast
bolt spell, the bolt will go around and home in to hit you.
I wouldn't worry too much about raising evocation being a wizard though,
since your main job in a group is to nuke, your evoc specialization will go
up quicker than others.
