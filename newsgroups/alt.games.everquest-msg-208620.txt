The summon point is approximately 2-3% [1] of the mobs hitpoints.  If
you (or rather anyone) has done that much damage then the mob will
start to summon anyone on the hate list even if that person hasn't
damaged the mob at all (casting Tash, Malo, Ensnare, healing other
people on the hate list etc etc etc...).

On a side note one of my best post 60 spells is Earthen Roots [2] as
it does no damage so it won't start the mob summoning no matter how
many times I root it.  It also sticks more often and for longer than
the older root line for various reasons but in PoP especially it's
the lack of damage that makes the spell so utterly indispensable.

Oh and the fact that it's a free click on the Ornate Chain pants is
simply gravy.

[1] Most people are by now using a numeric target UI I presume.
[2] Druids get it two levels earlier and an upgrade at 64.
