Dang! You watch and listen very well then for someone who hasn't played the
paladin class. I was very impressed in your knowledge of our class.
I do have 2 questions though. I am only a L30 paladin looking to make it up
to the big leagues someday...
In reading the posts, both people mention using Flash of Light, do pallies
at those levels STILL use that spell? Wow! Makes me rethink the usefullness
of that spell. Also, both people mention "stun". Is this the "Stun" spell or
stunning via Bashing?

Thanks in advance for any help.
