I'll consider those suggestions well. It makes me waffle even more about
what to do with those 12 points. But I've got a lot of time to decide still.

Fortunately, necros do not have requirements on where to spend the 12
points- else I'd not have asked- I'd have *known* where to spend them /grin.

My attitude is if I am in a situation where a mob must really die fast or
we're all going to die anyway, I've no problem going out in style. I assume
it screams EAT ME NOW in terms of aggro.
