    What rubbish! Sony act more like a God than a king, being that they are
not subject to or in any way effected by the economy. They control the
universe and the economy lives within that. They do not levy taxes, they do
not have to spend plat.

    It's a universal policy in that it effects how reality works. The player
economy is a pure capitalist one (except that its wonderfully luxuries
oriented, a beautiful piece of fantasy that) with no tax, no government, no
control.

    It's a universal system with a natural capitalist economy. God/the
universe in reality could wipe out the USA with a series of earthquakes and
tornadoes too but neither God/the universe nor sony need to buy food or pay
a public service or anything else that goes with running an economy or a
government - yes even a Feudal one.

    To a range they picked out of their backside more likely...
