I just finished reading Look to windward this morning, and that bit does
sort of strike a nerve. Did you notice any similarity between LtW and
the current political / war situation ? It fealt a bit spooky reading it
with no idea of the subject matter, then slowly watching events fall
into place. (Wow that doesn't even spoil it)

I love Banks, and have read all of th "M" stuff and most of the rest. I
still love feersum endjinn, kus he rites liek i reed.
