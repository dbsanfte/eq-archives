Well, this may not be your problem - but it has a similar effect.

Friggen slime ball low life spammers will scan IP addresses for open Admin
Alert ports (135) on Windows machines and send spam as though it were an
administrator alert. This used to cause EQ to die instantly, now with
window'ed support, who knows.

Blocking port 135 with a firewall, or disabling Windows Messenger (not the
chat program) is the fix ...
