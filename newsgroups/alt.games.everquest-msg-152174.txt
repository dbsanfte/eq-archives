There is only one thread and it started with a comment about the
motion sickness!

>If your question was about "will EQ make me motion sick because the

Expecting a certain level of graphics hardly 'pegs me as a console
junkie'. As it happens we do own a few consoles, but I enjoy PC games
equally, if not more, as I said, NWN is a particular favourite of
mine.

I find that for a FPP game graphic quality is important to me. When I
play Chess or Championship manager (for example),  it is not.
