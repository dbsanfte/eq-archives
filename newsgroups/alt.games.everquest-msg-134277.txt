In the new patch message:
> /makeleader <target> - The leader of the group can now reassign who
the
> leader of the group is by use of this command.

Instinct tells me that this is more useful than it appears,
thought I'd free associate a bit and see what I can come
up with.

OK, its easy to see that whenever the group leader has to
log out or disband, having him make someone else leader
will stop having to all disband and regroup.  A minor
help when you are all there, a much larger one if it happens
while the group is spread out over a zone or even over
multiple zones.

Group leaders have only one special power, and that is
adding new people to the group.  So any "angle" on this
is going to be based on the ability to transfer this power.

What I'm looking at, then, is the ability to transfer invite
power to someone who is far away from you.  Even more,
I'm thinking of being able to have A make B into a leader,
who then invites C, and then makes C into leader.

What won't be possible (and what probably is the possibility
that was making me think of tricks) would be to have A
somehow invite B who is already grouped with C even though
its impossible to get to C without a lot of effort.  We still need
to be able to get within sight of each person we want to invite.

Being grouped with people gives you several advantages,
but most happen near the other group members, so
regular inviting works fine.

Hmm, Four abilities work at a distance, though; Track
Corpse, Summon Corpse, Track Player, and COTH.

Track Player works much better if you are grouped
with the player, so that they appear right up at the top
of your list if they are in your zone, even if they are
otherwise well out of your track range. Still, opportunities
for massive gains in power using this seem very limited

Track Corpse.... ok, this is handy.  But you group the
or bard or  SK or someone with a chipped rod, who
then gates to zone line and invites the someone, you
track to their body, and off  you go.  No particular
gain in function for changing leader.

Summon corpse; just like track corpse

COTH.  This is the one that started me thinking.  And I think
its the key.

Most zones, its easy enough to get a low level character/bot
in to the entrance/safe spot.  If this character is group
leader in a group with a mage, he can happily invite
late commers so they can COTH in.  But now you have
a "leader" who isn't actually participating in the raid.  This is
a pain when it comes time to group buff.  If you let him
go, then you are stuck with the old invite plan of gating
a leader back out of the work area to invite again.  You
could COTH the invite bot to the work area so he can
be invited later and then gate back to zone line... clumsy,
costs a pearl and 700 mana.

It would be possible with two bots to put one at work area
and one at zone in... but what good would it do you?  You
can't invite the mage at the work area and then invite
latecommers at the zone line.  Only now you can.  Makeleader
the work bot, he invites the mage.  Makeleader the zone bot,
he invites the new fish.  New fish disband on COTH, mage
disbands when COTH done, go on with your lives.

Not that big an exploit after all, is it?  Anyone think of anything
else to do with this?
