>My only fear is this might unintentionally nerf druids and wizards.

There are only a handful of classes in the game that have spells that
other players are willing to pay for. (SoW, Clairty, Ports, Binds,
Res's) These money making attributes are a HUGE advantage for these
classes, and will always be in demand.

The addition of the Nexus (and SoulBinders) reduces the "need" for
these classes, not the desire.

Druids and Wizards have lost nothing. A trip through the Nexus still
takes at least 20-30minutes. Druids/Wizards have a much wider range of
destinations than the Nexus, and will remain the first choice for most
players.

The fastest way to travel in EQ is still your favorite Druid/Wizard. 

So I fail to see any "nerfage". 

Cheers
