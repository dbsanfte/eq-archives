Giving XP for gray encounters, no matter how small would not work.  At
my level, Nek is gray.  That means that
Commonlands/Sprawl/Graveyard/etc are all gray.  If I got any XP at all
from killing a gray, I could go to those areas that are heavily
populated and completely obliterate everything in no time at all, with
no risk at all.  Think of how long it would take to clear out the orc
area near the names in CL.  Giving a little XP per kill, multiplied by
the amount you can mow through means there would be no reason to risk
anything, except for loot.  If I am solo, I can't get the good loot I
want anyway, so why not just kill hoardes for XP?

Maybe adjusting the color cons would work, to provide a larger area to
get XP.  Getting XP from grays is definately not the answer though.
