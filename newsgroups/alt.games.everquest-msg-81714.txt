I am practicing JC and have a skill level of about 53.

Is it smarter to do silver bars and more expensive gems or do electrum
Malachite Bracelets?

It's a hard toss-up, because I've spent over 100pp in the electrum
Malachite bracelets so far and it seems like I'm barely progressing in
skill points.

Any help would be appreciated.
