   Um... I'm kinda slow, so let's see if I got this.  Jack loans
Ass his account.  Or perhaps he sells it to Ass from Players
Auctions. Jack then goes fishing or whoring or whatever for a
month.  During this time, Ass goes nuts, and gives away all of
Jack's stuff to Muffy.  Muffy thinks Ass is a bit creepy, but
since she is a female, she assumes it's the natural order of
things for Ass to showering her with gifts.  The Jack runs out of
bait, or money, or whatever, and decides it time go back to
farming Aqua goblins for the big cash (shhh... don't tell him
about the nerf).  So he calls up SOE and reclaims the account by
giving the original information.  Or he just tells his buddy Jack
that the party is over, it's time to give daddy back the keys to
the 'vette.  Whatever.  

   So he logs on and *wham* finds a stripped account.  And... and
this is the part that I'm having a hard time with... he's somehow
surprised by this?  So... after the "Give me back my stuff" rant,
why doesn't he tell the GM that Ass stole all his stuff?  Does
Muffy suddenly find herself banned for receiving stolen goods,
even though she didn't know the back story?

   And, apparently, never, ever accept gifts either.... least
they be from a pair like Jack and Ass.
