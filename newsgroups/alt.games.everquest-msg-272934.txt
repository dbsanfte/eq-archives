Does anyone have the details about what this AA does?  The description
is:

Stasis (Activated) - Use of this ability causes your opponent
to immediately fall into a deep sleep. The effect last for up to
one minute per rank.

So is it just like a normal mez, except that I can use it from a
hotkey?  Does it work on unmezzable mobs?  From the description, I
can't see what benefit it has over my mez spells.
