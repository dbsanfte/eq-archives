	Again, this has never been proven to be true.  There is every
reason to suspect that higher defense only means that you get hit for
minimum damage more often.

	Note that I am not saying that you are wrong.  This is a subtle
distinction which escapes many people, so I felt it best to clarify.

	What I'm saying is that no one has ever proven your assertion to be
right.  You may be 100% correct.  But you may be 100% incorrect.  It's
never been proven either way via any testing I've seen.  And I'm a huge EQ
math geek, and I've seen (and conducted) a lot of tests.

	One day, I *will* test this theory and find out exactly what
happens when AGI increases while keeping the same Armor.  But that's a ways
down the road, yet...

	AB
