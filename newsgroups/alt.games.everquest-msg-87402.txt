Bizbee did you actually watch that movie?  no one ever went to war over
the ice.  3 thugs showed up with guns started throwing their weight
around, Harrison Ford prepared them a "room" in the ice factory, was his
attempt to freeze them to death, they get pissed, start shooting, and
blow up the ice factory that was using amonia to freeze water. The amoia
poisons the whole area and he has to move on...


I mean usually I get a kick out of your posts, but this one was a little
off, sorry.
