Newbie armor, in terms of the quested stuff for your race/class, is a 
relatively late addition to the game; there were a few races who had it, 
or soemthing like it, but then they eventually ended up making sets for 
just about everyone (maybe really everyone, by now)

In general, by the time it existed, it was possible with fairly little 
effort, to earn sufficient pp in the game to go buy much better gear in 
the bazaar long before you could finish the quests.

I've done the quests anyway, or at least parts of them, due sometimes to 
a "this will give me something to do as I level up" or even a "I'm 
hardcore and I'm not going to use the bazaar for anything" mentality.

Thing is, they tend to be difficult, not because the mobs are impossible 
to kill, but because the drops you need are often really rare; you end 
up killing things long after they've gone green to you, if you really 
want to complete a full set.

I think my Mage was well over 20 before he finished his... then he wore 
it till into his 40s, not because there wasn't any better, but because I 
was prouder of the achievement than I would have been of anything I 
could buy, or even loot off random mobs.  Of course gear matters little 
to a mage, which is part of the point.

These days, anyone wanting the newbie armor would be well advised to do 
the quests out of POK; they yeild the same stuff, but are much simpler, 
a matter of "go do this quest" which is the same regardless of class 
(there's an evil one and a good one for each, but thats not a class 
thing), but that won't be available on the Progression servers.

Now on the Progression servers, on the other hand, there won't be any 
bazaar, nor any easy travel to whereever trade central ends up being, 
and there won't be trash loot that level 70s are disposing of for spare 
change, either.

Will it be worth pursuing there?

One thought about HOW to do the quests; I'm thinking that although I've 
always soloed them, thats probably not the optimal approach.  Each class 
seems to require different drops.  So if we set up a group with several 
different classes, all from a single race (or perhaps nearby races), 
then we wouldnt' be faced with so many "not for my class" drops.  And 
although there is an exp bonus to contend with, you still kill nearly 
twice as many mobs to get from level 10 to 11 in a duo than you would if 
you  were solo.  So maybe you wouldn't level up past the mobs while 
waiting on your drops!

Another approach would be the open market; hopefully the newbie zones 
will all be crowded with players.  /auction ing off the unneeded drops, 
and just /shouting out the location of No Trade unndeeded drops, could 
build up some community while helping fill in the blanks and get rid of 
duplicates.
