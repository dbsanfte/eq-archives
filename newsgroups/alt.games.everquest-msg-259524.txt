That's a great little movie. I go back and watch it often. I find both 
the images and the complimenting soundtrack moving. Though I have been 
playing for some 3 years or so, there is a good bit of content depicted 
there that I have still never seen, primarily due to never having been 
part of a good guild, I think (and partly due to my altoholism, to be 
sure ;) ).

It does capture the feeling of wonder from those early days.
