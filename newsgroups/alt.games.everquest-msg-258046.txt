Ok, I finally installed Sandra.  My Videocard it turns out is an "MSI
Geforce4 TI 4600" card.

It looks like it might actually have pixel shaders.  How will this card look
on Everquest 2.  Will I get the full potential of the graphics or will this
give me graphics which fall short of what everyone else gets?  What kind of
improvements would I noticably see if I did upgrade to a Radeon 9800 Pro if
any?

My system is a AMD Athlon XP 2.6
1.5 gigs of Ram

Thanks.
