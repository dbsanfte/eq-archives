I just need the fear drop for my epic. I've been to fear so many times
with no luck, but of course everyone else I talk to has seen the
shissar a few times..

So, a week or so ago, I'm talking to a friend who is doing a fear
raid. No shissar up. I ask in another couple hours. No shissar.
Another couple hours:

Them: "Oh, yeah it was up. Some guild just came in and took it."
Me: "Noooooooo!!"
Them: "They didn't even ask, just came in and took it."

/e dies.

Grrr!

My enchanter is 56, and still no jboots. Don't feel too bad. ;)

Good luck on your hate drop.
