I 2-box a cleric and will often do a little random grinding with just the
monk and cleric.  Best exp I've found 2-boxing (that doesn't risk death with
every fight) is doing "OC" in PoV.  I *might* be able to get an AA in under
3 hours there.  I couldn't even hope to do it without the cleric backing me
up.  I could narrow that time by ungrouping the cleric, but that's still not
soloing.   =)

I'd be interested in where you think a monk can solo that fast.  Maybe I've
missed some treasure trove of mobs that monks can actually solo decently for
experience.  =)  I'm sure it's not in PoP, as I've fought just about
everything there.
