Since you have 2 characters I assume you don't play on FV where learning
languages is necessary because there is no common language.

You won't find much use for languages but one of the ways to get it to go up
is to talk in a group with someone who is using the language you want.  They
should just spam the group with some nonsense over and over till you get a
skill up.  You could also waste some skill points in your guild on it but I
wouldn't do it unless you don't need them.
