Story snipped. Sorry to hear about your unpleasant incident, Daniel.  But it does
bring up a question in my lowbie mind:
   There is a lot of talk here about camping, etc.  I am coming up on the levels
where we're going to need to camp some spawns for some monk quest items in a few
more levels, and I'd like to make sure I do it right.  So what I want to know is
this: is there *really* any such thing as "camped" in the game beyond the polite
players agreeing to "play nice"?
   I understand that I shouldn't camp a rare spawn endlessly to farm it, etc. but
if I find the spawn area uncamped, and we claim it as camped while waiting for the
mob and drop, does that mean *anything*?  Can somebody come along and just jump the
mob, take the drop? Ok, I know they *can* do that, but if I /petition a GM about
it, no matter how politely phrased, do I stand a chance? Has anyone here ever
petitioned in such a situation and gotten satisfaction? Or will the GM just say,
"too bad. You guys learn to play together nicely."
