3k on Prexus... Im not that cheap :p  Actually... I saw it at 3k, then had
my 8k from selling a BP poof, and once I'd wasted time petitioning etc, I
looked again and the cheapest was 4.5k.. wtf.
I think I'll be patient and check every few days...

Btw I got my lockpick from 0 to 155 inside 2 mins!

(Of course it cost 1.6kpp and all of my training points, but hey I did the
hard work many times before.. this chars taking it easy!)
