First off...Welcome!!!

There are basically 3 types of servers.

"Blue" - Standard server with no "player vs player" beyond duels and
guild wars. Some items are nodrop (not tradeable or sellable), and
everyone can speak the common language. You are allowed 8 characters
per account on any of the normal servers.

"Red" - Player vs Player servers (there are a couple of different rule
sets and 4 different PvP servers in the list)

"Role-Play Preffered" - There is one server setup to encourage and
attract RP'ers (Firiona Vie) It has a different rule-set. Almost all
items are tradeable, you can only create 1 character per account, and
each race speaks their own language. (You have to learn other
languages to speak to some races)

Where you start is up to you.

If you want to Role-Play, I highly recommend the Firiona Vie server.
The community there is fantastic, and the total population on the
server is much smaller than most of the other servers that are more
established (eg older). So there is much less crowding in popular
zones/areas. The only downside is that you can only have 1 character
at a time on that server. If you want to experiment with other
races/class you will have to re-roll (a common occurance on FV) and
start over, or go to a different server.

If you want to experience Player vs Player, you can roll up a
character on any of the 4 PVP servers. (Vallon Zek, Tallon Zek, Rallos
Zek, or Sullen Zek). I have never played PvP, so I can't give you any
details about the communities or the different rule sets.

As far as the regular (or "blue") servers go, I would recommend
sorting the server list by population (there is a check box at the top
of the server select screen). The servers at the top have the fewest
number of players currently online, and the ones at the bottom have
the most. I would personally pick one of the servers nearer the top. I
prefer a server that isn't too empty or too crowded.

Hope the above helps :-)
