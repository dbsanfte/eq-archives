Yes, that's the best it'll ever be for you.

However, Hide is still VERY useful.  Target something that's not
indifferent, then hit Hide until it's indifferent.  Now you can sit
and med, be AFK, or whatever and as long as something that sees
through Invis doesn't show up, you're safe as houses, without worrying
about some spell wearing off.
