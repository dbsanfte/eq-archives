The damage output you keep reading about (56+ actually since that is 
when we get the first summoned hammer) is generally very much 
exaggerated. Secondly it comes mainly from proccing that summoned hammer 
which you will do even with melee skills of 0. Also when you get that 
hammer and swing it a little your 1hb and offense will go up rather 
quickly. 2hb is not a big concern as any cleric looking to melee will 
use the summoned 1hb hammer.

The melee skills you should worry about are defense and to a lesser 
extent bash. Both of those were rather low for me until I started 
playing around with the hammer while duoing with a shaman friend.
