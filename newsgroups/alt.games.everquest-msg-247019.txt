Bought it yesterday to check out the hype.

Definitely fun.  Good concept for a game.  What guy didn't at some point in
his life tie a towel around his neck and make like superman?

> Worth checking out?

Depends on what you want out of it.  If you've got $50 spare lying around,
you won't kick yourself for getting it and trying it out.

Considerably less complex.  Not that it's shallow, just not very complex
compared to EQ.

> Doubtful, but will it steal me away from EQ?

Again, depends.  If you like LDoN, it will have quite a draw.  If you like
raiding, probably not.  Keeping you away is another factor.  The advancement
is quite limited, no "loot" really, and to me the "staying power" is
questionable.  If you like playing lots of lower level characters in EQ,
this may be the perfect game for you.

I've tried just about all of them.  AO, AC, AC2, SWG, Eve, Wish, Lineage,
DAoC, etc.  CoH is a *very* well done game.  Whether the concept of the game
is one you will like is hard to say, but the game itself is quite good.
