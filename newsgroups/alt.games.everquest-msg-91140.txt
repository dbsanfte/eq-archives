Be sure the "Router Name" and the "Domain Name" is filled in.  An example of
each would be:

cx744392-a   which is found under "host" under the "TCP/IP -> NIC Card"
configurations of the computer originally intended to work with Comcast (ie.
the tech installed).

newvill.pa.home.com   which is found across from "host" labeled as "domain"
in the very same configuation, by the way these would be found in the "DNS"
specific tab when you go to the "properties" of above "TCP/IP -> NIC Card"
settings... the names will vary depending on the OS you are using...

EverQuest uses UDP ports 1024-9000, though this should not need to be
specifically stated in the Linksys setup.

As ackward as this may sound, I have found that in some cases it helps not
only with a better connection but a more simplistic configuration to drop
back to firmware version 1.30. I know the ones in stores are carrying only
1.40 (usually), though there is a new 1.42.3 out.  The older versions are
not available any longer, just checked.. :(

In either case, let us all know what OS each system is running, what version
firmware you have on your router (first page of the router setup page will
tell you this), etc.
