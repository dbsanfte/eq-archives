I could certainly be wrong here.  Lets say 40 then shall we?

And yes, paladins, in my acquaintence, generally used quite crappy
weapons, don't ask me why.  One paladin in ten would totally
blow my doors off with a freakishly twinky weapon, another three
or so would do better than I was, but not so much to embarass me,
another two or three would run neck and neck with me, and the
remaining three would do significantly less damage than I was.

IF there are damages that aren't being reported, this could be
in grave error.  This is, however, the first I've heard of such
phantom damage, other than criticals and such misreporting
the damage they do.

I'm basing my claims solely on self parsed, eyeball parsed
watching the damage reports roll in.  I'd do a /time, wait
a bit, do another time, and then go back and add up my
reported damage and that of everyone else in my group.

Most often paladins turned in the lowest melee damage,
and frequently I, pathetic cleric with a non-twink weapon
(either one I looted myself, in the first case, or one I paid
100pp in money I made fair and square for, in the second
case.) would actually outdamage them.  This wasn't
something I spent a lot of time discussing with the pallies in
question, who already were usually on the brink of quitting
EQ due to having a very lame class... Hybrids have been
drastically improved in the interim.  I did discuss it quite
a lot with warriors and monks that I grouped with, and
they didn't contradict my impression that I really was
outdamaging the pallies, which we both knew shouldn't
be possible.
