    The twinks sure could use an enshrouded veil or three, and a few
bloodpoints. Rosy needs the illusion mask, too. It's sad - I've had the key
since somewhere in the mid-50's, but because it's BYOG I've never gone.

    You make it sound like a free-will thing. Post 35, a lot of people were
FORCED to go to Oggok and Grobb if they wanted to level because Guk and Sol
B were filled to the point that folks could walk to ANY camp unmolested. My
very first character was a troll shadowknight on The Rathe pre-Kunark, and
the buddy that got me into the game spent his time split 50/50 between King
in LGuk and doing Rathe Mtn. rares, so I got to see a lot of how bad things
were. There'd be the same people killing Basher Sutok day in and out because
they couldn't get a group in Guk, while my buddy's King group had Froglok
Crowns on all their pets.

    Tell them "and that makes you different from everyone else HOW?" They'll
get the point - anyone can do that.

    Tee hee, ayup. Whenever looting comes up if I'm not with friends (where
we're usually after item X for person Y anyways) then I suggest replacement
NBG - if you call NBG, then the rest of the group gets to roll on whatever
the dropped loot would replace on you. It has kinks, like people using No
Drop items, but it really weeds out the loot whores - they NEVER want to
have to give up anything. And it also makes sure that certain camps can be
done by ALL classes with a reasonable expectation of coming away with
something more than coin without depriving classes in need of upgrades.

    Ah, chance for disagreement! Turgur's is the most broken spell in game,
so much so that VI has all but admitted that the 100% MR flag was there just
to stop that one spell. ANY mob that can have Turgur land on it is a joke to
kill, whereas I know several mobs where having a bunch of CHealing clerics
is no guarantee of victory.

    In many cases, worse. At least if you all pull through you can res the
ENCH back in. If the cleric goes down and there's no mage, well, time to do
a reverse CR - drag the body up to zone-in to the cleric with the party.

    Bah, if we're even in trouble it's because the ENCH is having resist
issues, which stuns won't help with. And "Barrier Up!" means no heals for
the ENCH, too.

    I've often wondered - would a defensive hybrid with constant CE be as
steady a tank as a warrior, with AC being equal? Just how much damage does
Defensive stop, on average, per second?

    Or a quick-witted cleric singles you out as the "Aego cleric" in ooc. 8/

    They don't get around engine limitations. Look at some of the situations
I listed. If we're facing an Elder Temple Guardian (or whatever those 300
damage fire AoE things are called), I cannot stand in the open or I char.
When we killed Eashen, I was face up against the wall of the niche like all
the other healers, with the main tank just in heal range on the other side.
If I hadn't have sat as Eashen was pulled so I could see through the wall (I
was still dubious to CoV), I'd have never seen him.

    Pretty much, but folks will continue to try. It's something to strive
for, dream about, and obsess over.

    Our "uppermost guild" still knocks over Veeshan's Peak on occasion,
almost solely for Robes of the Azure Skies. Perhaps you should have a talk
with them. 8)

    I'm not so sure. Unlike the buggy POS Funcom released, DAoC looks to be
relatively stable. It also has some features that would appeal to a certain
segment of the EQ market. I imagine there's gonna be a massive server spike
when SoL comes out, but I can certainly see folks leaving EQ for good for
DAoC.

    Bah, I need to get my monk a Fungi so he can blend in with all the
green-con leezards in Cabilis. Too bad my rolling skills could best be
described as "lacking". I think I managed to lose a roll on every individual
drop in all of Sebilis while there, short of stuff in Juggs-onwards.
