Evolution is a theory.  One with quite a lot of supporting evidence, one 
with quite a lot of fans, but still a theory.  Likewise, relativity is t 
theory... most facts seem to support it, but there are a few that seem 
to conflict.  Either some of those facts are actually incorrect, or 
there is some explaination we are missing, or the theory is wrong.

The same is true of evolution; it looks pretty good, but there are some 
conflicts, and there's a lot of missing data we'd expect to see. 
Alternative theories have been proposed, many of them -not- the "god 
created it this way" type, but real potential explainations that run 
contrary to the standard evolutionary model.  James P Hogan, for 
example, has a very amusing theory which relies on information passing 
between trillions of different versions of reality based on the quantum 
many worlds hypothesis; he claims it accounts for the fact that life 
forms seem to evolve far more quickly than standard evolutionary theory 
should permit.

Accepting a theory as fact removes it from the realm of critical 
analysis.  What if the theory is wrong?  Or what if its just a bit off? 
  Refusing to question it is -not- a scientific attitude.  In fact, my 
principle objection to most "creation science" is that it is not subject 
to verification or discussion; "because the bible said so" is no basis 
for scientific reasoning.

I was presented with quite a few theories in physics classes that were 
hopelessly out of date and long since discredited.  However, explaining 
them helped to teach the mathematical concepts in a logical order, 
instead of leaping straight in to quantum theory... and it helps that in 
most "real world" applications, the discredited theories were easier to 
apply and gave perfectly useful results.  For a simple example, consider 
Kepler's theory of orbital mechanics; so much easier to apply that rumor 
has it we used it to go to the moon and back, despite knowing that 
Newton's theory was more accurate, and that Einstein's theory was even 
more accurate than that... and despite the fact that looking back, 
Einstein was probably also wrong.

Facts aren't subject to majority rule.  If one person has things 
correct, and 99 have it wrong, then they don't get to overrule the one 
person.

The idea of teaching creation as science fails IF the proposed theory 
isn't based on observed facts, fails to predict future facts, and 
demonstrably can't be verified.  This doesn't preclude it being true, it 
just precludes it being scientific.

Similarly, even if Evolution meets all the above criteria, and fits 
every observed fact you can come up with, and has in the past given good 
predictable results which have come out correct, this does not mean its 
correct.  One fact coming out sometime in the future which contradicts 
it can disprove it, and you can't rule that out based on all the facts 
you have so far.  If this -isn't- true of it, then, like creationism, 
its not science, its just a belief.  Which also doesn't preclude it 
being true.

If you want to call Evolution a "fact" then it also shouldn't be taught 
in any serious science class.  But I don't think there's a whole lot of 
support for your view.
