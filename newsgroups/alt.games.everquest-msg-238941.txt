From the shadows, the mysterious "Archerbear"
<archerbear@notqwest.net> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

As my newsgroups history will show, I've been there from day one.
Thanks for trying to show your expertise though.


>I was also in the DAOC beta.

As was I.


>The point I was making wasn't that EQ was horrible and DAOC is great.

And thats not the point I was arguing with either. I just pointed out
Mythic's extreme history in nerfs. They took the lead from Verant/Sony
in nerfitude a long time ago and haven't looked back.


>Instead, I prefer Mythic's corporate culture to Sony's.  Mythic explains,

It's also worth mentioning at least half the things Sanya said were
flat out wrong, and later quotes showed she apparently didn't even
play DAoC.

But that is neither here nor there. The relevent part is watching
Mythic change class after class, almost universally nerfing. Many of
them were deserved, some were not, the majority were never really
thought through.

Mythic is the king of nerfing.


>In short, there are things to like and dislike about both EQ and DAOC.  But
>Sony treats the customers as walking wallets, and Mythic treats customers
>as.... customers, who have a choice to go elsewhere.

Of course. Mythic is all about the appearance over the substance,
right from day one.
