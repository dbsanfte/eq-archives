At 14 I took my druid out to Thurgadin, said hi to Dain Frostreaver IV while
he was getting getting familiar with an uberguild, left, got my GD tooth,
gated.

all told, a waste of 2 hours... =P  (especially since my guild can't seem to
get anyone through Kael alive for WL tooth, not that I've tried it myself
yet)
