Attended the Raid, or Order of the White Dragon's Armour Farm, as it really
was.
Fortunately, as it was just pulling to safe spot I would have had to try
really hard to mess things up.
Hardest thing was filtering out or off to other window, combat and spell
messages so I could read chat, not had to that in an age.

I came away with a set of boots (was allowed roll on one, minor, drop) and a
Bracer (no one wanted) so am pretty pleased.

Felt very out of place as I knew no one except MT and no one knew me, oh
well, at least the enchanter kept me hasted and it appeared that the druid
that I kept asking for CoS was actually AFK and not ignoring me :�) Not
knowing names/classes was a problem...trying to find them by sight is not
always that easy with so many ppl in a small space...at the shaman are easy
to spot in bear form :�)
Not sure if I'll do more as yet, at my relatively low level I feel more like
just another mouth to feed rather than anything close to a useful addition
to the raid. On top of that, not being part of the guild itself means
equiping me isn't actually any sort of investment to them.

Oh well, it's been a while since I've worn anything that I didn't buy in the
bazaar :�)

Didn't actually die on raid but did lose Druid and Warrior in KD, didn't
realise I was still KoS to Tormax or, more importantly, I was going anywhere
near any Giants on his faction...still, sorted that out next day.

Raid started gathering at 12am BST...I logged at 6:30am...Would like to
thank Red Bull for keeping me up :�)
