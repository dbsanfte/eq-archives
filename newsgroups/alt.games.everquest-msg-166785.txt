No. It is beyond their grasp. They can adjust the drop rate, set no
drop flags, and the like, but no. It is too much work. I think they
are more worried about keeping order and not allowing people to ruin
the games for others. That is an endless task.

I disagree. 

tradeskill items, Drop rates == rate of production
PP == medium of exchange (albiet inflationary)

Vendored and camped items are not a primary variable.

There are no taxes. I need not worry the money I own will disappear.
It is still the same amount. It may be worth less, but thats the
breaks.

False, I made a few plat when I started a new character and was
thrilled when I earned a few plat. I recently moved to a new server
and had a few plat by the time I was 3rd level. I recall my first monk
having almost nothing a couple years ago at 5th.

Hehehe. Interesting term you have there. The nobles of the middle ages
often bartered titles, lands and goods for other titles, lands and
goods. Thats capitalism. There are no real controls on the prices of
most items in the bazaar. If a fungi dropped from every orc pawn in
WC, how much do you think it would be worth? A vendor may charge you
5k because verant coded it that way, but in the bazaar, it would cost
maybe 50pp, not the 50kpp it may be.

What prevents a shaman from charging 70pp for a SoW potion? It costs
about 65PP to make, why is the price 100pp? Nobody bestows that price
on the player, he just fixes the price.

What a stupid thing to say. If you were not an idiot, I would be
offended.

By whom? Rush? He doesn't teach enconomics. He is an AM radio
entertainer. Likewise, I don't study English history by watching Benny
Hill.

I didn't say conservative. You did. I said capitialist. You have no
idea who I am or my political affiliation. If you would ask me, I
would say, "None of your business."

"Best to be silent and thought a fool than open your mouth and remove

I will ignore that advice.

-OT rant on-

How terrible for you. There are no other systems that would have
created the Internet, Everquest, or even the personal computer. They
may have, granted, but they didn't. Why do I say this? Sony made EQ to
make money. They didn't do it so they could add more money to the
government for taxes. Brad came up with the idea to be rich and
famous, good capitialist motives.

Historically, captialism has provided riches for many, while
despotism, socialism, and communism, have served to repress billions
and taken what rightly belongs to them from them.

Aside from the wealth that people labor to produce and may not keep,
these governments take away "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of
Happiness" from billions. If you have even read Adam Smith, or any of
these people you can see what the Framers of the US Constitution
intended when they insisted that they add the Bill of Rights.

It has been often imitated, but NO nation has given up the rights that
our government did when that was passed. WHY? Because our Framers
recognized correctly that no government owns those rights, and that
those rights are bestowed on people by the Creator!

I say that capitalism is one of those rights. We have limits on it,
but for the most part we do business as we wish.
