}With our skills and tech, we can.

I've always felt that changing the environment to be one we can survive in 
is sort of cheating. :) Sure, we can live in an undersea geothermal vent, 
as long as we bring air and we make it not so hot or sulphurous. :)

}and air.  Specalized to an extreme.

Yep.  Now, how did it get that way?  Take a bunch of bacteria, say, 
salmonella, and drop it on an antibacterial plate.  Within very few 
generations, it will have evolved to resist the antibiotic.  Usually about 
2 days.  That's a hell of a lot faster than humans can "adapt".  Same if 
you take away a vital nutrient or change the atmosphere.  If you have a 
large enough sample population, the odds are pretty high there's already a 
mutant there that will survive it.  I just hope they don't evolve to resist 
bleach anytime soon. :)

}Mutation is lifes best friend.

Well, about one time in 30 it is. :) That's why it helps to be rolling 
those dice a whole bunch of times about every 30 minutes.
