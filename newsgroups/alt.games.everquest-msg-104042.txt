If you happen to have Flash of Light and can afford the mem space for it,
this casts faster, for less mana, and generally sticks better than any root.
If the job of that root spell you long for is to get aggro off someone, (most
likely
yourself) then Flash can be a much more reliable alternative, it casts so fast
you don't need to be able to channel it, just cast it in between blows.  If you
need to flee this gives you a head start, if you're trying to shift aggro to
tanks
its very low aggro and won't cause the trouble another handy spell, Stun, will
in this regard.  On the other hand, it suffers the "long recast time" problem
you mention that Root doesn't, which is why Root is still almost always sitting
there
in my slot one... or was till I got Immobilize.  Flash -if- I could spare the
space which I generally could until I hit 44 or 49, somewhere in there.
