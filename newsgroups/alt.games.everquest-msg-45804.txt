No way.  There are valid reasons for this to happen in gameplay.

They could have just disbanded and regrouped.. . .there's no reason to have
to wait around for several hours when you can do that, invite a wiz/dru, and
get out.

I can just SEE the exploits there.

That could be nice, but. . .

The practical issue here is that all of these things would require more
server resources.  Also, keeping a LD character active keeps it from logging
off -- meaning that you can't log back in until your character is done doing
whatever it's doing. .
