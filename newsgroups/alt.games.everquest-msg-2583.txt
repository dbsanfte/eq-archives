}Safe fall.

Well, those work. :)  I fish on the boat sometimes.  It seems to me as if 
standing in certain spots allows it.  It if doesn't work where you're 
standing, move back a touch, or to the side a touch, and try again.  I 
generally like to keep it to where I can still _see_ the edge of the boat, 
so I don't accidentally fall off.  And the instant the boat makes a turn 
or zones, the spots that work seem to change.

But I haven't done it in about a month or two, so... who knows. :)
