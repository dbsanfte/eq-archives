I've been riding since I was 14 also. Raced motocross for many years.
But I have never put a bike down on the street in all my years of
riding. I can also still walk and run perfectly. I don't think being
stupid enough to have to go down on a bike is something to brag about.
Even more so when it's a multiple of times. Sounds like you picked the
wrong hobby mate.

Avenger.
