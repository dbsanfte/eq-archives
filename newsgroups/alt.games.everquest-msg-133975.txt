Bah. By the time I can play it, it'll be old news.

My hardware took a major hit recently (nearby lightning strike, which
took out the surge suppressor on my cable modem line), and the machine
pretty much died last week. I managed to get it limping along again,
by pulling out the sound card and half the RAM, but it still locks up
and crashes fairly often.

Probably a total wipe and reload of the OS would get me fixed up, but
I'll never trust this hardware again. And since I make my living with
my computer, I have to have a reasonably reliable system.

New MB, CPU and RAM on order. Getting an AMD 2100+, and 512MB of
PC2700 RAM. So, the new system will be a bit faster than my old 1.4
GHz AMD.

I'll probably turn my old parts into a basement-beater machine for
testing network software. 

And amidst all this, I have a major programming project to fix for a
client, ASAP.

I hate computers sometimes.
