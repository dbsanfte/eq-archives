I saw him during the day once.  And two days ago,  a group of guildies 
camped him for one of us (hey s.age users, remember that whine that 
nobody in our guild helps anybody else? ;p) - killed everything we could 
in the desert during the day, killed the 8pm spawn everyone talks about, 
and he popped.  Dunno whether any of that helped, I was just amazed at 
the short amount of time it took.
