Firstly you must activate the skill by investing at least one training
point in it in whatever ranger guild you are near (I assume
Kelethin/Gfay).

Then click on the ABILITIES button, click on a spare ability slot and
forage should appear new as an option to drop in the slot. You might want
to move forage over to the left hand side button box for comvenience but
you should be clicking that button every single time it resets assuming
you arent actually attacking. It takes a fair amount of work to get it to
a useable level but once its reliable the you'll never buy food again.
Plus you can skill up your brewing and cooking skills moderately cheaply.

On the right hand side of the screen in the Abilities/combat/socials box,
below that the actual buttons relevant to the option you have selected

On the left hand side fo the screen is the empty hot key button box.

Click on the right hand side so you can see the ability/skill you want to
hot key. Left click and hold the click until the skill appears to attach
itself to your cursor...then move it over to the left hand side and click
again to drop it into a hot key box.

You can assemle a bunch of useful skills and self made socials all on one
panel that way, and set them of by pressing a single number key on the top
of your keyboard. The numbers on the keyboard correspond to the hot key
boxes as below
  1   2

  3   4 

  5   6

etc etc etc....
