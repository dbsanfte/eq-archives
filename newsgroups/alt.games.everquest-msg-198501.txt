How about Anekin Skywalker? Probably spelled it wrong, but no matter. 
That was just one off the top of my head and a quite well-known one at 
that. As I recall, he was quite the whiz with androids and about anything 
else mechanical.

Now you're going to presume to dictate what everyone else wants out of a 
video game? You're also presuming that *you* will be the lead character?!
Or anyone else for that matter? This is a MMorpg as in "Massively Multi-
player".  That means there will be, if I may hazard a guess, *several* 
people other than yourself involved who, now bear with me on this point, 
just *might* have different ideas of what constitutes a good gaming 
experience. I know, I know. Crazy concept, but you are not the one person 
with the perfect idea of what the game should be.
