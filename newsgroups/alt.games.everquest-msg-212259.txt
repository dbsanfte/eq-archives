Hmm, last I checked the local politics on Stromm there was one guild
in Vex Thal and another trying to get in.  A third guild was ignoring
Luclin and working its way through PoP (actually there might be others
doing that as well).  Don't think Sleeper's been awakened, but I could
be wrong about that.  I'm sure there are more than a few 65s with alts
in their 60s.  The guild in Vex Thal supposedly required all mains to
make 50 by mid June, I haven't looked at their roster but I imagine
that most of their mains were 65 before the end of July.  In the small
guild of which I'm a member my Druid is definitely lagging at only 51.
While the newbie density on Stromm is higher than on older servers,
most of the players are veterans with at least one character over 50
on some other server (actually, I wouldn't be at all surprised to
learn that most had at least one character over 60 elsewhere).  There
is also a significant number of folks who quit EQ 6 months or more
before Stromm opened who started up again just to play on a "new"
server.
