i dunno who told you that its hard  to  use monks for pulling in kael but
they were wrong. very wrong.       they are  the  only way to go when you
are pulling from   the tormax area, protectors, and the  vindi area.    in
fact we use  dual monks with a chain puller alot of the time.

pulling is one thing and  tanking is a different matter. monks and warriors
serve  different  purposes in  parties.
