I got Necro:

You are dark and mysterious
Even those that know you sometimes question how well they really know
you.
You are misunderstood.
Most people think you are odd, and few can see past that eerie presence
of yours.
Deep inside, you are sensitive, smart, and have a gentle heart.
Got Angst?

Then, went back and changed one answer I wasn't sure about, and got
Druid:

You are kind and gentle.
You love Nature and all of its inhabitants.
With the possible exception of Man.
You can be a little selfish at times towards natures enemy, Man.
However, if there is an animal in need of help, you are the first to
respond
Join PETA, my friend.

The funny thing is, they both fit.
