  I'm not terribly impressed with them: they are terribly 
clunky to use (at least they were the last time I checked 
them out). On the other hand, I'm more likely to want 
very simple DBs with just the material I need, rather 
than monolithic DBs. 

  My wife finds a use for BigClock and TikTok, both timer programs
for the Palm. The latter is great for timing multiple events. 

  The two programs I get the most use out of, though, are 
Joust and Bejeweled. Great for those multi-minute downtimes 
in EQ.
