> Can anyone bind in Skyshrine or Kael? Or just casters?

Of course.  They're both city zones.  Not everyone has
sufficient Coldain faction to bind there, you know.
Where do you think people on Kael faction bound before
SoL was released? :)

General rules for bind:

Melee-types:  City zones.  Special areas marked as cities
while the entire zone isn't.  (FV and OT outposts, etc.)

Casters:  Any non-dungeon zone except CoM and old-world
dungeons (not counting CT, as a guess.)

Special rules include the 'by zoneout-only' bind rule (for
everyone, IIRC) in (at least) Kael and Skyshrine) to
avoid the problem you're discussing.  You can zerg in
Kael, for instance, as long as you pull to zone.
