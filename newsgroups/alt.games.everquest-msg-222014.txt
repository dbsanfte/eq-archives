You left out str and dex buffs (HoS/Focus at higher levels). A good
str buff with noticeably up the average damage of a pet if you parse
it and dex is always good for pets if they have proccing weapons.

All the pets have a chance to dual wield but it doesn't happen very
often with the low level ones.  High level pets, a pair of good
procing weapons will upgrade Puppup's DPS by around 50%. 

Another nice thing about a mage partner is haveing someone to mal-x.
Mage can do that on incoming w/o getting agro and the shaman can slow
faster.

Only thing I really miss in that duo is lack of snare and pulling
skills (No FD, pacify, harmony)  ...that, and the annoyance of trying
to keep the mob on the mage pet instead of the shaman's. 

Overall though, it's argueably the best duo out there for straight up
fights. At the high end, you can duo summoning, unfearable mobs that
I'd be very hesitant to try with any other duo. Mage/shaman combines
the best offensive and the best defensive class in the game and should
serve you well however long you want to duo.
