Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I was reading in another thread
about how one can't buff other players in EQ2 unless you're grouped
with them.  Does that mean that the buff only remains in effect while
the "buffee" is still grouped with the buffer, and the buff goes away
when the group is disbanded?  

Thanks in advance,
