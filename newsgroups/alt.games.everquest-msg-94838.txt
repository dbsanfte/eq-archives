A good place to practice, just a few multi-kites, is the 30th level goblins
in BB near Kaladim. There are only 3 there now, and they have a long spawn
time in between, but its a nice safe place to practice. There is a lot of
space to move and you are close to the guards, the gobs have almost no MR
and very few HP for there level. After a few kites and you get the hang of
it, Cougars and Dire wolves in Iceclad is the place to be. I prefered Dire
wolves since the cougars conned amiable to my wolf form - hated the idea of
slaughtering friendly animals :). The Dire wolves are closer to the EW zone
as well, and away from the pirates, so Wolf Form is safer. At 34, you
probably won't have the mana to finish the quad, it will be very close. I
had no problem at 35 with 190 WIS, even with a resist or two. Just don't
panic if mana runs out, ensnare last 10 minutes. If the beach is clear, run
a little further and med up till you get another bolt off. Keep the group in
sight range, though, or they may loose interest.

If you do quad in IC, I'd bring the group down the cliffs to the beach until
you are very familiar with the area, there are many adds there. Those
friggen Dervs are a pain in the butt.

Oh yeah, ensnare and Lightning strike are the only two spells you need, no
DoT's - unless you get 3 dead and the last one is snare dumb.
