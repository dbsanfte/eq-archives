Heh.. i went to Sebilis last week for the first time in a long long time to
exp, my wizard was just 4 blues from 59 and I wanted to level..  anyway some
51 wizard beats me to calling a camp, then makes a group consisting of 3
wizards, a 55 bard, and a cleric.

It was only necro (trivial as sebilis camps go) and we did HORRIBLY.  The
only melee damage was coming from the bard (which no offence but your not
exactly the greatest dmg dealers  =)  the bard was also the only form of
crowd control and mana regen, and puller till i got bored (m a monk at heart
heh)

It was no surprise to me, I told the bard at the start that our group was
gonna suck ass... and it did :)
