Just be prepared for the fact that halflings in general are looked
upon with mild contempt by many people. I have absolutely no idea why
that is, I just know I see unfavorable references to them all the
time.

They *do* make great rangers, stat-wise though. For either rangers or
rogues, I would dump all points into STA - this has a direct effect on
your total HPs - with any leftover points going to STR to help you
carry more stuff without becoming encumbered.
