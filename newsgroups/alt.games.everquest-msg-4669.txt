I'd go for it :)

My warrior is the one with the best suited name; hers means Flying
Eagle. My mage's name means Cord , my shadow knight's means Dog Kennel
and my druid got my main handle, meaning Dark One.
I also have a monk on another server (for when EMarr is down during my
hours) whose name means Third Leap - I actually think I have several
of her spread around on different servers... the name was already
taken on EMarr, though.

Aside from my trusty Moohl, I only have one character who didn't get
her name from an astronomy book.
