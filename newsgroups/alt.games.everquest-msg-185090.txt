Some of us don't have any other option.  I live out in the middle of no
where, so they don't offer anything other than dial up.  I don't think my
local phone company likes me too much, though, as I have a 3rd line just for
my computer, which stays connected 24/7 (auto-reconnects when kicked), they
believe I should upgrade to a 'business line' (meaning I should pay more for
the same thing).  Hm.. i'll pay them more when they offer me more.  I could
get satellite, but there is a delay on the recieiving end.. great for
downloading and such, horrible for gaming.
