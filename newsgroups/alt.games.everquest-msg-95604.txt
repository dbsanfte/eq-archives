Meditate is used to help regen your mana faster.  For Clerics, Druids and
Shaman, they get medidate at 8, Casters, like Necros, Wizards, enchanters
and Mages get it at 4, I believe, and Hybrid classes, like SKs, Rangers,
Bards, Beastlords and Paladins get it at 12.  Reason why Casters, like
Wizards, for isntance, use their spells heavily, and need to recoup their
mana faster than say Clerics, who, at the beginning, can actually take and
give out melee better than casters.  Hybrids like Rangers and such rely
mostly on Melee, with the support spells to help further them along, but
their strength doesn't depend heavily on spell casting as Wis-casters do.

As for why the button is there...  It is an indicator that you have
meditate on.  Some people will forget to put in a training point for
Meditate, and suffer longer down times recouping the mana they used.  Also,
until you get to level 35, you can only meditate while in spell book.  At
35, you can sit without the spell book to meditate.  Most players try to
rush level to that so they can get rid of the book, especially soloers, so
they can do the root and nuke bit without waiting for the dreaded 'Your
root has dropped' while medding, shaving off a couple of seconds in your
response time.
