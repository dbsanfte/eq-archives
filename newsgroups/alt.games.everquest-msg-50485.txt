No, I can't. But if I remember correctly, most of the times I've 
grouped, I've had to reload songs all the time. Let me see if I can 
recall them correctly (sorry, been a year)
3 chants
selo
hymn of restoration
mana song
chains (snare)
screech (fear)
haste buff
stamina restore

Yes, I did have to rotate between these quite a bit depending on who in 
the party went oom or afk, and how loudly the less inteligent people 
yelled "don't fear, just sing mana"

Actually 3.5 was the limit of my connection. And in most cases in BW I'd 
be singing the 3 chants. If area permitted and mobs didn't resist to 
much, I'd snare-fear. When the casters would whine a lot and I wouldn't 
feel like explaining why I should not sing mana song, I'd twist mana 
with hymn and haste
