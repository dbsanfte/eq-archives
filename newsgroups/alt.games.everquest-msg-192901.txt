I spent the better part of two days leveling and collecting with my
new ranger in Qeynos Hills.  I finally found all the items I needed
(even after a server crash deleted a couple of the rare ones) and made
all the armor parts.  It looks horrible.  Green footy pajamas.  

Anyway, I go hunt the poacher down and kill him.  Take his head back
to the glade and in return I received some XP and a RUSTY PINE SCOUT
LONGSWORD.  I thought there was a better sword as a reward.  Do I have
to sharpen this rusty sword to get the good one?  If so what is the
trivial on that?  Or is the quest just not as good as I thought it
was?

Thanks
