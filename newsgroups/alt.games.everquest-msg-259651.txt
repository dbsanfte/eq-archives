Well, I don't know if this is related, but I remember a few times as a
newbie when some high-level player gave me a high-level DSl, and when
I would fight a blue mob, the DS did so much damage that when the mob
died its corpse went poof and I got no experience, so I in effect got
KSed by the DS; this didn't happen when I fought even or yellow mobs.
Can somebody confirm this?
