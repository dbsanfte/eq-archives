Apsolutely not.. Bards suck at soloing.  The best solo class is a Warrior.

Actualy bards are some of the best soloers out there. No mana kiting, charm
Kiting when you get older, Decent melee. But your songs are the big ones.
Most people cant play a bard past 20 or  even 10. twisting gets verry
monotanouse. the one plus to being a bard is that you are never expected to
chat.  your fingers are always hitting the cast keys.

On PvP servers Bards are hated. for there level untill verry end game they
just do to much damage.  The one thing I would like to see them do to kinda
balance them out a bit is make them have to stop to use Clickies like
everyone else.
