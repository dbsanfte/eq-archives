I know it is the router because when I connect my cable modem directly
to my computer (via CAT-5 Network wire), I have no trouble. But when
my router sits between my cable modem and computer, I get disocnnected
from EQ within 15 minutes. I have a linksys Router model BEFSR41. I
know how to get into router setup through my web browser. If someone
can offer any help on altering the settings so EQ won't disconnect me,
I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.
