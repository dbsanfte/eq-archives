That's actually an interesting idea I've not seen implemented before.

Hmmm That's a pretty good idea. Perhaps difficult to justify in anything 
but a magic environment, but a good idea.

And for decay, it depends on how decay is done. In SWG decay on items is 
use based. Powergamers need to replace more often, but can. casual 
gamers can play a month on a single pistol.
