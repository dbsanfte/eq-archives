1) get a 65 cleric with HOV
2) buy some peridot
3) sit on your butt in POK announcing V for donations, minimum one peridot
4) cast only for full groups
5) when your bags are full of peridot, go sell em

Why does this work?  Because it doesn't take 5 peridot to cast HOV!

For extra bonus riches, get a Reagent Conservation IV item, which will 
prevent using peridot at all 1/ 10th of the time

Think of the riches.

Whatever you do, don't get off your butt to actually go play the game 
and make far more pp per hour than you ever would following this lame hint.

Bergh, 65 cleric, Morell Thule
