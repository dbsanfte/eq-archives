Same here....when I'm aaxp'ing with my main or just grinding through
a hell level with my alt, they'll pull in my RL brother's 47 druid if he's
not
online.  I don't even get serious with it...let the druid DS and
occasionally
heal the rogue if needed, and then just hide/med.  The tracking is also
useful.

I'd never bot him on a raid or anything, but it IS nice to have a free
powerleveler around, as well as a port whore for raids.
