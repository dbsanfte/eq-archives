Well, I find that with the right selection of equipment, a Rogue can solo 
well. When I solo, I use a SBD, for the snare dot in my primary hand. the 
8damage is not the best BS rating, but it serves well in solo. in my off 
hand, I use a GNoll Hide Lariat. proc Stun. Stun+mouselook=4 or 5 back 
stabs per fight.

Now I dont fight reds or even whites, I stick to blues, and try to pick 
ones that run at 25% health.(not skelies or cats which fight to the death).

Also, afer your SBD procs the slow/dot, try instill doubt. your next BS 
wont be, but you are taking no damage while he runs from you, and sometimes 
it lasts long enough for the BS to recycle.

Drawback? Bandages are expensive, and solo work is boring as hell.
