ouch!

We only killed Doomshade once, last week.

We were assembling for Rumblecrush (who we can kill with no problem - best
kill was about 22 people, 1 warrior, and me with our 1 bot shaman)... anyway
RC has insane DPS until he is slowed but after that hes pretty gimpy.

That was a 3 guild FCFS race tho (pretty funny.. both guilds had 30+ but
delayed until they had 35.. in the meantime we had our best ever kill on it,
flawless apart from my shaman who got pwnt by rampage)

We waited till a few more people showed up (RC is usually 30-35 people) and
in the meantime Doomshade popped.

We had just over 20 people, figuring RC was the "boss" of umbral though, we
determined Doomshade would be gimpy.. an easy kill.

keke.. famous last words.  No cheal rotation setup or anybody really
expecting it, we lost about 10 people in the first 3 minutes.   We managed
to get it under control and he did drop 1st time, but he sure surprised us
