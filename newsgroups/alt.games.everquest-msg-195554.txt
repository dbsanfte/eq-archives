Not just more, easier as well. You used to be able to take down 4 of a 
given mob before you ran the risk of losing control and running OOM in 
the middle of a fight. Therefore, that 4th mob carried a certain amount 
of risk. Now, you don't breathe hard until the 5th or 6th. I'd say that 
makes that 4th one easier. Therefore, taking down 4 of them has been made 
easier.
