The druid epic effect takes quite some time to cast, so you
wouldn't be wanting to rely on it to snare mobs that are already
angry at you.  It would be possible to pull static mobs with
it, but roaming mobs will often move beyond cast range while
you are waiting for it to finish up.. this means its of limited
use for initial pull.

Since any druid with an ounce of sense makes snaring the mob
one of his first priorities (he may pull it unsnared to a fight spot,
but soon after arriving there its snared) this means you are
almost always going to be using the epic effect on a snared mob.

Here's what sucks about that.  Druid epic DOT/snare lasts
three minutes.  Druid's real snare, Ensnare I think its called (the
level 29 one) lasts ten minutes.  The epic snare component
overwrites your other snare.  So now you just turned a mob that
almost certainly wouldn't outlive snare duration into one that
might have to be resnared twice per fight.

As a cleric, I rez a lot of druids.  Principle cause of death, snare
broke and they got mauled trying to resnare.  Longer snares
mean fewer dead druids.  As a cleric, I'm all for this!

On the other hand, I don't see why you'd have to fix the
epic by removing the snare.  Either make the snare portion
last 10 minutes, or make the snare portion not overwrite
other snares.  This way if you -did- want to use the
snare part of the epic (say for mobs that die relatively fast,
and won't outlive the snare) you could.
