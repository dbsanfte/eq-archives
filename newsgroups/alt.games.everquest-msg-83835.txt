I only know one for sure, the horrible breakdown on Tribunal two years
ago that caused them to upgrade their backup equipment. I seem to
remember a much less severe problem on another newer server of the
time, Nameless of Brell maybe, but it was very foggy and I can't be
sure.. I thought I'd cover my butt by assuming it happened for real
and not in my imagination.

Well its a bit early to call it that yet. Rollbacks happened all the
time in UO though, and sometimes in AC. A OSI or a Turbine, yes.
