How did you know he doesn't group?

Ohhh, I see, you jumped to the asinine conclusion that since he asked
for a place to quad-kite he doesn't group at all. I'll bet that at 46th
level he's been in a group or two and still likes to solo occasionally.
Just a guess.

Play your character - have fun, let him play and have fun.

Buh-Bye
