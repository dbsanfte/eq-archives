It's an inside joke.  Georg's name really is georg, and she really is a 
female (or jaZZ will feel really, really silly when he finds out), and 
everyone assumes by the name, that she is a male.  Tirra Jorg... you're a 
georg?  If it weren't a name, it would almost be a pun.

Arolpin
totally made up name, but a piercing and a bottle of Rolling Rock provided 
inspiration
