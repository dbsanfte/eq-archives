20 years of usenet have proven that top posting is bad on usenet.  It makes
threads harder to read, and makes it less likely people will trim things,
leading to larger messages.

Or do you think your time is so valuable that it is OK for you to disrupt
threads for thousands of other people, because you are too lazy to do it
right?
