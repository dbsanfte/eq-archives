well, i read all the posts and it seems to just be a matter of preferance,
so i researched the water one cuz i just like it the best.  cost me a
fortune, too.  the words cost 50pp each and i failed once and had to buy
more for a grand total of 100pp (that's alot when you're main's on a
different server).  but it was well worth it to get rid of that stupid earth
pet.  thanks for the help guys.
