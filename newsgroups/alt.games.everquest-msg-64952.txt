Jazz, buddy!

Have you learned a lesson yet?  Build yourself a system dammit!!  It sounds
like from the hassles you're having you're going to just about know how to
do it from simply upgrading, hehe.
The benefits:
1) You know exactly what the Hell is in it!
2) No-one will know your system better than you.
3) The word "proprietary" will virtually disappear from your computer lingo.
4) You'll know better than to put junk in your system.
5)  It's surprisingly easy!

If you would like a simple run-down on how to do it, drop me an Email.  I'll
gladly scan an article I give to anyone interested in getting away from
those damn OEM systems.

Good luck,
Sean...
