Maybe if you had the minimum RAM (256 MB), it would help.  Even better would
be the recommended 512 MB.  Before you say that it worked fine before (ad
nauseaum), the game has a much higher requirement and takes advantage of
many more features of today's computers.

If this game were stuck in 1999, people would be complaining that the
graphics were passï¿½, that the framerates sucked, and that you could do so
much more using DX 8.1, GeForce cards, high-end sound, etc.  And, they would
be leaving in droves for better looking games.  (Better looking is obviously
a better game, right?)  My guess is that you would not be playing any more
without the content/graphic upgrades that are constantly ongoing.  If you
don't want to upgrade your computer (and memory is dirt cheap, right now),
then maybe you should start living with the longer load times and stop
kvetching.
