I couldn't resist hitting the link and christ what a bunch of
assholes. The language on the posts was clearly d00d speak. Reading
through the thread reminded me of watching Dumb and Dumber. FoH as the
two morons who act like asses and though everybody looks at them like,
"What retards", they are oblivious to everybody else, living in their
own warped world where this public behavior passes as normal. I'm
talking as much about the thread as the playing style.

Oh yeah, and one of the officers had an animated gif of himself and a
high elf female head bobbing just above the bottom of the gif towards
his crotch. What a class act; his parents must be proud though I can
guess they (or more exactly his single parent mother who works 60
hours a week) aren't around much since he acts like wolves are raising
him.

I can only hope they suffer the same fate those 25 members of Conquest
did. I can dream too.... :-)
