Oops yeah my bad. But not really a problem, LQ pelts are plentiful and
can be bought off vendors in newbie areas pretty frequently. I had no
trouble getting to 200 smithing skill, and I have 2 stacks of leather padding
on a mule still. Tailoring is a nightmare compared to how easy smithing was.
Not like the rarity of Brute hides, sabertooth hides, drake eggs, Velious pelts,
Acrylia ore, etc.
