I have never seen this happen because I don't hunt there, but I have read 
various threads here about this type of thing happening in that zone.  The 
players definitely know about the bug, and I'm sure Verant does, but it's a 
looooooong time since I first read about it and it's still not fixed.

Just be aware that it can happen and prepare an escape for when it does.

I believe the mobs are falling through a "crack" in the zone and end up 
under the world, where they ignore the Z axis and still attack you.

Wait until you're in the OOT or somewhere and your corpse falls under the 
world and some people can see it, yet, others cant.  Interesting, yet, 
frustrating.
