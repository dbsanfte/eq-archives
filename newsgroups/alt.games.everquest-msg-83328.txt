Is the 'Deluxe Sewing Kit' not available any more? 

And if so, where does one find them?

They are 10 slot and I remember when their name was changed from (I
believe) 'Large sewing Kit' to 'Deluxe Sewing Kit'  The new 'Large
Sewing Kit' only had 8 slots like normal backpacks, 'fletching kits',
etc.

So, are they available somewhere or do those characters on the new
servers have to suffer through life knowing that they will never have a
10-slot sewing kit?


Thanks for any help you can give me.
