Hey, *I* got one of those. And even got one of them
before I knew about the horrors of Kithicor at night.
I must have been extremely lucky, I had ran back and
forth through that place at least 4 times and must
have hit day each time. Went to run through one time
and a nice person said 'Uh, you know the undead are
still out there, right?' I wiped the drool off my
level 18 or so chin and said 'Duh, no, should I be
scared?' and then checked tracking. I hugged the zone
until they all went away.
