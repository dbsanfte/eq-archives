Most AoE spells do not effect your group members. They can have more of an
effect on pets in the group but not the group members. A good tactic is for
the "nuker" to target the main tank and fire off on AoE thus nailing the
Mobs around the main tank. Plus I "think" is makes the Mobs think the damage
is coming from the tank keeping arrgo on him/her and not the caster. But I
could be talking out my hind end on that last part.
