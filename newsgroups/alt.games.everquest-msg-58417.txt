  Unfortunately, everything I've heard about enchanting from friends and on
message forums is that it's a basically impossible trade to achieve a high
level of skill in, unless you're willing and able to make a heavy investment
in platinum.

  Usually players don't sell gems to other players, since it isn't generally
worth the time and effort to wait on a novice jeweller to sell the stones to
them.

  If money is a factor, I recommend that you try to recoup your investments
by selling the cheaper enchanted jewelery to newbies/lowbies.  It's slow,
but if you can only afford a few bars of silver, it's really your only
option.

  I think the three cheapest items you can produce that you might actually
be able to sell to other players are the silver/bloodstone (STA+2 earring),
silver/jasper (WIS+2 ring) and silver/star rose quartz combos (INT+2 ring).
The reason I'd think those would sell best is because the finger and earring
slots are often not yet filled by newbies, and these items boost some of the
more "vital" stats (wisdom for healers, intelligence for casters, stamina
for melee).  Of course the boost is so small it's negligable, especially at
low levels, but you might be able to squeeze 3-5pp outta newbies and lowbies
each for them.  I don't think market for CHA+3 necklaces is quite as strong,
but I could be wrong.

  Once silver/bloodstone and silver/jasper goes trivial, your next best bet
might be silver jade rings.  They are AC 1 and boost mana/HP by +5.
However, jade stones will cost you around 4pp or so, so that's getting
pricey.  You still might be able to break even on them, if you're lucky.

  Overall, it's a really expensive and difficult skill to raise.  With only
8 bars of silver, the chances of you getting even 3 skill increases are
probably kind of slim.  For this reason it REALLY helps to have a solid
income before you get in to jewelcraft if you want to take the trade
seriously.  Kind of a bummer, but that's the way it is.

  By the way, http://eq.castersrealm.com has some good jewelcraft resources.
Of perhaps primary interest to you would be the jewellery table
(http://eq.castersrealm.com/misc/jewellery/jewel_table.asp) which lists all
the stats and properties of the items that can be produced with the
jewelcraft skill, as well as the common cost of the gems.  Also, there's the
trivial table, located here:
http://eq.castersrealm.com/tradeskills/trivial.asp?tradeskill=4.

  Good luck.
