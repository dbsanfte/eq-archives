Spite makes right, I always say. /sarcasm off

I'm curious as to why you would change to bottom posting, but only if asked 
nicely? Would that be because you would feel it was the right thing to do? 
Are you saying that the propriety of bottom posting is directly relative to 
the manner in which you are addressed?

Sack it up. Pick one, whichever you think is right all things considered, 
and stop mewling about how you're just doing it to get back at someone.
