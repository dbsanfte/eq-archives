I shamy shouldn't heal (except if cleric cant on the moment) but keep his
mana to slow the mob, debuff, and regen.
Druid is here to ... what r they used for ? lol ... jk :)  They snare, DS
tanks, root adds, grp resists buff, pack regen and DD.

As a cleric, i love to play with a samy, a shanter and melles. Druids and
shamy can do the main healers ... yes .. single pulls ... big downtimes ...
but they can do it, as a cleric can nuke. 600dmg DD at 44 is not so bad, and
49 DD vs undead is fabulous.

My biggest fun was in to group with 4 war/monk and a chanter. I was using
almost only group superior healing and i was the most of time full mana and
we did chain train pulling.

Druid and Shamy as healer, can't do this. They cant heal faster enought to
cope with train or adds. Shaman maybe could with slow. But, who heals him
after being agroed after slow ? And, how much mana is used per fight ?
