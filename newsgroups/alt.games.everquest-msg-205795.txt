Very true.. outside POP.  In POP zones, I see literally no difference between
600 AC  and 1100 AC in how hard the mobs hit my cleric.  HP gear helps, dodging
helps a bit (get hit fewer times) but AC?  Mobs hit far too hard for what
meager AC I can put together, and I haven't heard a cleric argue otherwise with
more.

Now 700 -is- pretty pathetic for doing stuff outside POP, I found I could
viably tank solo mobs to death in a number of zones including FungusGrove at
56+ (when we get a real weapon at last) on 1000 AC, but buddies with more HP
and less AC were telling me it wasn't working for them.

What I -have- seen a lot of clerics argue is that plate armor should be plate
armor, and AC on all plate classes should protect the same; yes, your Defense
skill, dodge, parry and (absence of) riposte skill will be less than that of a
warrior with the same AC, but that aside we shouldn't take any more beating
than they do.  This isn't currently the case, apparantly, although someone
recently said that a lot of this sort of thing is based on outdated studies...
it matches my personal experience though, "real" tanks (bards excepted) in
plate take far less damage than my cleric does, even when I have several levels
and better AC than they do.
