Nah, they've gotten so used to RvR, that they decided to try a little NGvNG.
Repel the invading hordes!  They've ruined their own game, they'll not ruin

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
