Hmm, well, I have 3 kids, 10,8, and 5, and they have their own computer in
their playroom, my 10 yr old in particular is better than most adults around
a pc, but even my 5 year old is more than capable of surfing the web ( yes,
I restrict to handselected domains), and playing most any game on the
computer. lol, my 10 year old is playing with my copy of Flash 5.0, and not
doing too shabby  =)... I'll put it this way, .... they got their new pc for
Christmas from Santa (upgrading them from a p2-300, to a 1 gig Athlon), and
WinXP is the os, they havent managed to crash it yet, I've made absolutely
no adjustments to it since OS installation )


However, I concur that letting a child have the opportunity to delete a
character is ridiculous, I sure wouldnt leave my char selection screen up
when im gone, and my PC is upstairs in my office, a "forbidden" area )
