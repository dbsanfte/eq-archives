Level up.

It's that simple.  On a regular night in Old Sebilis (level 50+
dungeon) it's not impossible to come out with 500-1000 pp worth
of "junk" drops (cash and gems), or get lucky and walk out with
a 50kpp drop (my alt rogue won a Fungi tunic on _her_ second
trip ever to OS, only _two_  days after getting a Mrylokar BP...I
believe my monk is level 30 now with 19 hours /played ;-)  ).

Nothing worth really really big money drops at lower levels.
It used to be that some midlevel creatures dropped lower
price goods worth buying, for instance if you'd had a Walrus
Tooth back pre-Kunark you'd have been a rogue god until level
40 or so, while these days every level 1 rogue has at LEAST
a 10 damage piercer.  Something like the shiney brass halbard
loses it's appeal when you can get a much better weapon
for 1/4 of what the SBH USED to sell for or be worth.

Wait until you see somebody offering "210kpp for a Horn of
Hsegra, ask your guildees" and you'll really go "doh!!!"
:-)
