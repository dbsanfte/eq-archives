It drops off of Xerkizh the Creator in Ssra - requires a raiding force to
take him down.  I went on a quite a few XtC raids until that darned hammer
finally dropped.

The EE rings require an Ethereal Energy brick, Ethereal Temper, and a file.
Keep in mind, however, that you need a minimum skill of 220 to attempt the
combine, and that the trivial is 212.  Yes, you heard that right, the
trivial is less than the required minimum.  SOE didn't want people to use
these things to get skill-ups, so with a 5% modifying item you can get at
most two skill-ups with the EE rings.  With a 15% modifying item, though,
you can get 20 skill-ups.  And  EE bricks are plentiful and Ethereal Temper
easy to make.

Without the 15% modifying item, though, stick with acrylia or shadowscream.

=)  Go-go SK the Giant-Killer!

I was fortunate to have 50K in the bank when I started my smithing
obsession - all of it from selling outdated equipment.  That allowed me the
flexibility to do things like buy stacks of leather padding from vendors in
the bazaar rather than having to farm it myself.

Yes, getting your INT maxed will help tremendously.  I again was fortunate
that my WIS was maxed when I had KEI.  My biggest advantage over you is that
I started smithing after I was 60 and already had some gear and plat.  Wish
I'd started sooner, though, because although I still get some good sales,
the Heraldic market has become saturated lately.  If I'd started six months
earlier, I'd be one rich guy right now.  =)

Completely off-topic... one difference between servers I've seen is "C3"
versus "KEI".  On Drinal it's been KEI and only KEI.  I've never seen it
called C3.  And why should it be - the spell's name is not Clarity III.  =P

Most of the chanters in my guild have Voices of Quellious now, though, and I
still ask them for KEI, so I shouldn't be one to talk.  =)
