Ok, perhaps I'm nissing something here but...

IMHO wizards are good for 2 things.  They have no flexability nor offer
anything but raw power for end game use only and emergency exits when it
hits the fan for groups.

They are great soloists -- quite easily out performing druids -- though
druids are more famous (infamous) for this.

In groups I usually prefer a magician over a wizard because a wizard just
doesn't offer that much vs a mage.  A mage adds a tank to the group (via
pet), has very powerful nukes and a great damage shield.  A wizard offers
snare and the ability to nuke ONLY when the thing is almsot dead anyway.  If
I use my druid, the evac can be handled by me vs a wizard.  If my enchanter
is running the group, I usually don't worry about the evac or I'll get a
druid to handle it so we have a healer / buffer there as well as nuker...

My reason for asking is, of late, I've been running more and more groups
with my Druid and Enchanter.  In these groups I hold a biase against Wizards
due my perception of their weak offerings to a group.  They just don't seem
to be as valuable as other classes so if offered the choice between a wzard
vs a magician or necromancer or druid or shaman -- I'd usually go with
almost any other class.  Their end-of-fight nuking is just to low a priority
to worry about.

I'd just like a better picture of where they fit in because they don't
strike me as all that great a group char (only real value is transport to
planes and the like).

Thanks in advance for helping me better understand this class because I'm
fairly sure I'll be hearing about my misconceptions on this subject... ;)
