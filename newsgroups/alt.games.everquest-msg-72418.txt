Yeah, for the most part we've been lucky and found the entry area mobs
down through the balcony uncamped and just stuck with that. With the 25%
xp bonus in there, it really seems to make the xp bar fly. (Well, as
much as it will ever fly after 51 that is.) We were doing it with a
"less than optimal" group too, if you follow the conventional wisdom.
Since joining my current guild, I'll confess to having been a bit
spoiled regarding group composition. Our raid leader is a 53 chanter,
and we were often grouped with him. And the guild is kind of "monk
heavy" in makeup, so I rarely have to be puller anymore. But Friday and
yesterday we had a group of warrior, cleric, rogue, and druid, (with the
occasional addition of a much lower level wizard who we were
semi-PLing). Certainly not too shabby, but required different tactics
than normal. I was back to pulling duty and we had to rely on tag tank
mezzing for the adds. It could have only gotten weirder if the cleric
had insisted on melee/nuking and making the druid heal. ;-)

But it worked great. There's eleven spawns before the drop-off down to
the balcony, and they seem to be on a 22 minute timer (roughly). Once
you get them broken in order, you can pretty much just keep single
pulling all the live long day, providing you don't get lazy and let the
twins and the gate and the balcony respawn to full. Loot has been total
crap, but who cares? The xp has been insane.
