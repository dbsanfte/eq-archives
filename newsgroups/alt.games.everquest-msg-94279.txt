Most code does not like it when you 'hot' patch it.  From the looks of
things, zones are 'hot' patchable, to a degree, just that players will also
have to get the changes as well.

Some of the fixes are not 'hot' patchable, because of the data involved.
For instance, Faction reporting, from the looks of it, seems like someone
missed an 'increment' counter or something to say, "Your <faction[n]> has
gotten <factionlevel[k]>." then went k=k+1, but forgot the n=n+1 factor, or
accidentally removed it and not know about it.  Well, that isn't something
you can change a file and have it magically, work.  That's a shutdown,
recompile, restart issue.  Things that references say, text, might, but the
faction is being set correctly, just the first faction group gets repeated,
which leads to a hardcode bug than a softcode bug.

Also, from the looks of things...  Items don't have a 'softcode' entry
either.  I have a crapload of the Deluxe Sewing kits...  The Pre-nerfed 10
slot sewing kits that use to be sold, some of it changed, but for the most
part, it is still as it should be.  There are people selling Pre-nerfed
Circlet of Shadows or Fungi Robes, which suggests that there are levels of
specialized data constructs for items, and in some cases, they can't just
change or remove items softwise, otherwise, I would be one hell of an upset
player when all my 'Large Sewing Kits' sitting in the bank, containing
items I had, suddenly lost 2 slots, making me lose 16 items at once...  Nor
would there be 'turn in your old item for the fixed one'.

You will also notice, of late, they have been throwing out some hot
patchable fixes, but those are client end issues, ones that don't require
data handling, which is what some of the item fixes.  The thing to
consider, is that anything that may have to alter data or reference data in
game, will probably require a not-hot patch, because it is part of the hard
code.  Data that the code reads from can be hot-patchable, and the client
itself can be hot-patchable, only when the way it references or sends data
is not change between client to server.
