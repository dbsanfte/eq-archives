You must not have had a cleric around. 

I suicide to accomplish goals without hesitation. Be it for insane 
pulls, reaching an xp group (either by suicide train or corpse summon), 
and even as a ghetto gate in some circumstances, and sometimes we'd take 
a named knowing full well we'd never survive the adds. But the shot at 
the item, even if we wiped 15 seconds after looting it was deemed 
acceptable.

But I always had a cleric around. I might have thought twice if we 
didn't.
