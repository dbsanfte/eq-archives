Virtual world grows real economy

A computer game played by thousands of enthusiasts over the Internet
has spawned an economy with a per-capita income comparable to that of
a small country, according to new research by a US economist. 

The online fantasy game EverQuest lets players create and control
characters - or avatars - within a fantasy world called Norrath.
Characters gain skills and possessions that they can then trade with
other players using the game's currency of "platinum pieces". However,
many EverQuest players have found this process too complicated and
have instead opted to sell their assets for real money though trading
web sites such as eBay. 

Edward Castronova, of the economics department at California State
University at Fullerton, studied thousands of EverQuest transactions
performed through eBay to determine the real-world economic value
generated by the inhabitants of Norrath. 

Castronova discovered that Norrath's gross national product per-capita
is $2,266. If Norrath was a country, it would be the 77th most wealthy
in the world, just behind Russia. 

Valuable currency 

Castronova also found that Norrath's virtual currency is more valuable
in the US than the Yen. And his research shows that EverQuest players
earn an average of $3.42 for every hour spent playing the game. 

"It's a robust, free-market economy filled with wealthy, hardworking
people," Castronova told the online news service CNet . "What you see
with EverQuest is that economies happen by themselves. If you get a
bunch of people together and they have things they can produce and
opportunities to exchange them, you've got the makings of an economic
system." 

However, he notes that not all the assets are converted into
real-world cash. 

Future of e-commerce 

Castronova says that EverQuest's economy can be studied like any
normal economy, even though Norrath is a fantasy world. This is
because of the social importance attached to the game by its players. 

Castronova believes that virtual worlds like Norrath could eventually
become more closely linked with the real world. "Virtual worlds may be
the future of e-commerce, and perhaps the internet itself," he says.
"Ordinary people, who seem to have become bored and frustrated by
ordinary web commerce, engage energetically and enthusiastically in
avatar-based online markets." 

Launched in 1999 by Sony, EverQuest is one of the largest role playing
games on the internet. According to Sony, the game has 400,000 users
in total, with up to 60,000 inhabiting the game at any one time.
