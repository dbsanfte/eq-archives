Hmm..isnt Neth Lair fairly well lit? It is sounding very clip plane issue
like to me.

Make sure screen glare isnt a problem - play with any (even small amounts)
of screen glare and a dark zone suddenly becomes utterly invisible.

As to spells well there are several Infravision spells and I think an
Ultravision or two around.

If you can, make a froglok character, or a Dark Elf (both with
ultravision) - take them to Paludal via the PoK books and see what they
can see - if its still a real problem then I think its a setup issue.
