I would agree that the Geforce2 MX is not probably going to fix anything.
I had a P II 400 mhz with 128 mb ram and a diamond viper tnt video card,
and going to a Geforce2 MX really didn't improve anything.

However, I did get a processor upgrade from Evergreen to a P III 800 mhz,
and that was  a big win.  I had pretty much given up on Kunark as unplayable,
but with the processor upgrade I see much better performance.

For whatever the reason, Velious has always played much better for me
than Kunark, so with my new setup I get very good performance there.
