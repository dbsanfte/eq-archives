Just for clarity, I'm not quite *that* under equipped.

As far as comments after / during groups go, only once have I gotten "Damn,
what do you have like 3k hp buffed or something?"  the other 10 have all
been "Thank god, nice to finally group with a solid tank for once."

I'm still annoyed at the question though.   Especially when I know it's
being asked by a ranger / beastlord that I know from watching "backflag
chat" is barely elemental, much less equipped than me.

And perhaps I'm a bit sensitive on the subject.   I used to be one of the
strongest tanks in the group I raid with, but I left the game for over a
year and a half.   Then when I came back finally, I couldn't raid more
because it took 3 - 4 months to pickup all the elemental flags I was
missing.   By which time they had mostly stopped raiding elementals.  I'm
still trying to build up enough to get through Vxed / Tpit, so I can join
them in Uqua and Qvic on GoD nights.   Now though, I'm among the lowest HP
tanks that actually go with them.   I still get invited but sometimes it
feels like it's mostly out of courtesy, for who I used to be there.

*shrug*   Anyways, for what its worth... while I'm somewhat embarassed about
my HP gear when one of them ask... for pickup group tanks I think I'm on the
high side of average.   Just over 10k hp with all PoP buffs.   11.3 k hp if
everyone in the group has their OOW hit point buffs.  (Oh, but the equipment
level of the group isn't important, just how equipped the tank is.  Don't
you dare ask if they have those buffs before joining)
