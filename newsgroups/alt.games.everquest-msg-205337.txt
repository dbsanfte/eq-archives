Hmm.  So that KEI buff I have now is merely an illusion?  ;)

It is, indeed, 45.  Last night I went to the Nexus, got KEI, then went to
Dulak (such a perfect town!) and killed mobs around the docks until I got my
black medallion, which I then turned in for my heal-over-time spell.  The
mobs in Dulak hit hard and have a gazillion hitpoints; without KEI it would
have been just about impossible to keep any kind of area clear.  With KEI
and my Deepwater Helm I was able to keep one entire pier clear, and during
my fourth round of repops I got my medallion.

And when I got to the beach, the erudit spirit was up!  I didn't have to
spend hours killing placeholders.  So I turned in my medallion and got my
spell.

Now I'm back to soloing undead in the Combine spires in the Dreadlands.
They are ever-so-much easier to kill, and with KEI I can kill them much more
quickly.

Comforting to know that I am no longer a no-talent twink that uses a bug in
KEI to level quickly.  I am, instead, a no-talent twink that's using KEI as
intended!
