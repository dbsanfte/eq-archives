Assuming that everything happened exactly as you said, you were
absolutely right

Rotting means come get it, I can't/won't use it, or I already have it.
Now, its possible, that someone else sent the guy a /tell saying they
were OTW to get it, which is fairly common practice, but not required.
That is the only scenario I can see that makes sense of his response.

So no you violated no rules of ettiquette, and you got an upgrade that
might have rotted. 

Good for you.
