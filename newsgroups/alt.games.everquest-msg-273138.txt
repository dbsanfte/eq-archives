Well, when you followed up in support of a post that referred to the 
content in question as "verbal diarrhea", you pretty well made your opinion 
clear.

A large portion of us (the a.g.e. crowd, anyway) completely get and 
appreciate the post. All complaints thusfar have come from the c.s.i.p.g.r 
crowd, who are obviously unaccustomed to Bob's EQ write-ups.

It really all boils down to, if EQ2 isn't your bag, why bother with reading  
*any* part of such a long post? For crying out loud, I don't pick up 
Women's Day magazine and complain because there's little in it of any 
interest or relevance to me.
