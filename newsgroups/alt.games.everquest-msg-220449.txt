    Kosh was enigmatic, even about normal things. Delinn was enigmatic.
Hell, even your ranger buddy Marcus was enigmatic. I don't want to watch a
show where all the characters know everything but won't tell "because the
time isn't right" or "because I don't trust you yet" - that's artifice.
That's what made a show like Doctor Who good, story-wise - you learned as
they learned.

    Tell me the big differences between Sheridan and Sisko. Or Ivanova and
what's-her-tough-chick from DS9. Actually, that's unfair to the DS9
characters - they actually evolved from what they began as. The two
characters that I found changed significantly were G'Kar and Londo, and
G'Kar's evolution was more a magical metamorphosis to forward the plot.

    Assuming you believed the blowhard character's utterings about seeing
his own death, that is. And that is still a lot different than showing him
in his decayed throneroom, telling someone all about how he's posessed by
the Shadows, isn't it?
