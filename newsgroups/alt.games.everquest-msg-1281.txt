I run EQ on a fresh install of WinME.  The only problem I have is that when
I go from Antonica/Odus/Faydwer to Kunark, the lag becomes so bad I have to
exit the game, reboot my computer, and restart EQ.  Everything works great
after that unless I go back to Antonica/Odus/Faydwer and return to Kunark.

This problem also occurred under Windows 95, but the lag in Kunark was
intermittent and not as bad (which was actually worse because I would
sometimes believe that it was not going to affect me).
