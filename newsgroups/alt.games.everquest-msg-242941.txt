  I looked over the link.  I hate to say it, but I wasn't that impressed. 
It does go into more detail on why top posting is Bad, but I don't think it
says alot more on the subject than the FAQ does.  And that white text on
black background was plain ugly.  If I get more input from others saying it
is a good addition I will add it, but until then I will pass on it.  Sorry
Emmett.  I don't want to discourage you from making any further
contributions if you are so inclined.

   Well don't be a stranger.  You're one of the sane ones.  We can use that
around here.
