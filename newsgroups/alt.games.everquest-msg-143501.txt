You HAVE to have a haste item. If you don't have any haste
to replace the Sash then you HAVE to wear it. Trust me, for
melee characters HASTE > all.

What are your gloves? Depending on what your gloves
are you might want to sell the Sash and get some more cash and
buy some Silver chitin handwraps(which also have haste) and then
you can wear the girdle.
