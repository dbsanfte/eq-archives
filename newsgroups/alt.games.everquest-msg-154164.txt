I can buy that for, say, FD pulling.  That uses a fairly subtle interaction
of the way FD deals with aggro, and the mob AI that decides when to follow
or go home.

However, let's consider the Manastone.  3N HP to N mana.  As soon as you see
that ratio, it should be immediately obvious that any class that has a
better than 3:1 HP/mana heal can use a Manastone for free mana regen, and so
there needs to be a casting time large enough to limit that to something
reasonable.

This does not require Sherlock Holmes-level deduction to figure out.  All it
requires is figuring out that after someone Manastones themselves down 3N
health, they are probably going to try to find some way to heal themselves,
and then figuring out the obvious consequences.

Or how about that Cleric breastplate that cast CH?  At the time they
introduced that, Cleric mana use was the major determining factor on what
mobs a raid could kill.  It should be immediately obvious that any item that
gives Clerics a mana-free heal could be a big problem, and should be
examined closely.  Mana-free CH -> no need to wait for tank HP to get low to
maximize efficiency -> Cleric clicking BP every 30 seconds -> any fight in
which the tanks can last 30 seconds between CHs is a fight that the BP
trivializes.

Heck, for most of the things that have required major nerfage, they have
been instantly recognized as insanely overpowered by the top uberguilds as
soon as they enter the game, so it clearly doesn't take 300k people playing
to figure it out.  All it would take is running new items by Furor and a few
people from the other uberguilds first.
