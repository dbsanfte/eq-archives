On February 14, over 800 accounts which repeatedly violated the 
PlayOnline Member Agreement were permanently banned from PlayOnline.

The users of these accounts would form groups to monopolize the hunting 
spots of notorious monsters (NM). They also repeatedly performed 
harassment and MPK actions against other players.

Grief tactics, including harassment, are listed in the PlayOnline Member 
Agreement as violations and are not allowed for any reason. Also, 
interfering other players' game play in order to monopolize monsters 
which spawn in hunting spots is not allowed.

Based on the above, we have taken strict actions against players who 
have violated the PlayOnline Member Agreement.

If you become a victim of harrasment, please make a GM Call and report 
the issue directly to a Game Master.

Your understanding and cooperation will help us provide the best 
experience possible to our players. Thank you!

Comments: On the one hand... this is really a drop in the bucket. Prime 
time on a Tuesday (US prime time), we have 33 servers, and my server 
which is one of the lower pop ones, had 2700 players on it...  meaning 
probably 100k online total. Last I heard they were well over 500k 
accounts (approaching 600k). 800 accounts is ~0.1% of that.

At the same time, it could have more of an effect than I anticipate. I 
actually noticed people that I see in areas every time I log on missing. 
This is not 800 faceless accounts, they are people lots of people have 
recognized as missing. They are infamous.

A month or two ago they suspended 4000 accounts for 10 days. All 
accounts that supposed gilsellers. By day 10 some prices on the Auction 
house, (such as the gloves my monk needs) had dropped by more than half 
from an insane fortune to mearly premium priced. Mind you, they are back 
up at the insane fortune level..

IGE has this to say about it, apparantly:
Play Nice, Don't Monopolize!

Hundreds of thousands of people, like you, enjoy playing Final Fantasy 
XI. Everyone plays to have a good time. Friendliness, courtesy, and 
respect for others are as important in the online world as they are in 
real life. We encourage all players to be good citizens of the gaming 
community. Exploits, hacks, and monopolizing camp spots so other people 
canï¿½t acquire good items are destructive to the whole game experience 
for everyone. Game economies are not helped by making it difficult for 
other players to play and enjoy the game. Any activity that makes 
playing the games less fun hurts us all. We encourage you to use common 
sense, common courtesy, and enjoy the marvelous adventures in the games. 
Help everyone have fun and all else follows.

Just to see what the market was I checked my server. 1 million gil only 
$43. That looks to be about the price of 75k plat on EQ1
