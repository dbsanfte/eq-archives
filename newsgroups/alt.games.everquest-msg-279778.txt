Raiders are far more likely to have multiple accounts in my experience.  And
not just a second account either, but often a 3rd or a 4th.  It is the
*norm* for raiders to have a second account, and people will express
surprise to those raiders who say they don't.  Also, raiders are far more
likely to go inactive (remember, I was just talking about log-in-every-week
raiders) for long periods while keeping their account active, planning on
coming back after their child is born, military service is done, etc.

My figure was also based only on "competing" guilds, not including the
guilds that raid in a far more relaxed manor of which there are more than a
few.  I really dunno how many of them there are, because while I'm invisible
to them they are equally invisible to me (maybe moreso since I would have no
clue when to look for them, whereas you can look for me at 7 p.m. EST).  =)

I didn't think that my response above was all that creative.  =P

I think the number is technically correct.  I do think it likely that
possibly as many as 1/4 of those accounts are "inactive" while still being
paid for at any one time (in a rotation, not the same 1/4 as last month or
next month).

Part of the reason I say DoN is the best single-group content is purely
because of how much effort was put into the scripting of it (if only they'd
put similar effort into storyline).  Creator even is a good example, far
more creative than sitting at a camp in RS.  And there is a large variety as
well, many missions that I have yet to do for the first time still.

No doubt about it, raiding needed the additional content of Kunark and
Velious to really get "established" as an every day playstyle.

On the "bleeding edge" however, one day for Naggy, one day for Vox, one day
for Hate, one day for Fear, and you're a "hardcore" raiding guild.

Those raids happened at much lower levels (just like the first Vox kill was
done by a mob with an average level of about 35).

Surprisingly wasn't.  I was a magician until monks who could see in the dark
came about.  =)  Though part of the reason I switched to monk is because I
was giving my guild a collective heart attack pulling Hate with my magician
(we had zero monks, which were quite rare back when Faned was created).

Looking back, hindsight being what it is, sure it was pretty silly.  I saw
the Froglok King, and collected his toys, at a far lower level than most do,
though.  =)
