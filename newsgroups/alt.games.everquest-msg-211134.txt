I really don't see how that illustrates that...

My opinion, when the conversation turns to boy/girlfriends, why feel
the need to hide your preferences at all? Like I said in my previous
post, sure, maybe some will harass them, but more and more these days,
those that do will end up finding themselves the targets of the
majority. And, there's still a chance it will come out even if you do
hide it...and then it will be that much more difficult to deal with.
People don't like being lied to. So, don't lie.
