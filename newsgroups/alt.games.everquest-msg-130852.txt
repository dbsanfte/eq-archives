Apparently for dwarf newbie armor, though the drops or the quests are
not in yet. Some are okay faction fodder though:

Goblin marauders. Two okay sized camps on butcherblock shore between
delin(?) and friends and the dock. One single spawn by a tent is far
to the left on a corner. They appear to be quite low level. NICE thing
is they raise

Emerald warriors, Gemchoppers, stormguard
In one kill (High elf, gnome and dwarf guards?)

A wandering greenblood
Wanders, like the rest of these new things HIGHLY aggro
no matter what your level. Greenblood is the ogre sk guild in ogguk,
but these are NOT on that faction nor are they ogres (they are trolls)
Killing them gives you:

Lowers 

broken skull clan (Lynuga (ruby giving ivandyr's hoop quest.. might be
bad to lower and Bugglegup in steamfont)
Apparantly the backstory on broken skull clan is a bit like Unkempt
druids; they are some renegade trolls who did not believe in going
civil and making the city of grobb. Very few of them are left so its
moot except possbily for the lynuga quest I guess.

Raises

Debashers (troll guards/warrior guild in innothule grobb?)
Shadowknights of nightkeep (troll sks)


A towering bulk(forget if right) 

These are a few ogres by what was an abandoned monument.
Killing them lowers

Ogguk citizens =(

I think those are the merchants and such in feeroot and ogguk who are
indiff to all pretty much. So killing those might be inconvenient. In
fact making them lower that faction may be verants way of making it so
my wood elf druid and such characters like it won't be able to merrily
buy and sell in ogguk or feeroot (if they had killed too many of these
ogres)

Finally, a few dismal rage necros by an abandoned totem near the orc
camp. These are messed up. They say dismal rage, but are SCOWL to my
wood elf druid who got dismal rage in east freeport to MAX ALLIED.
Even though they are obviously NOT on the same faction, killing them
LOWERS 

opal darkbriar
Dismal rage


Again, these are all HIGHLY aggro no matter what level you are.
