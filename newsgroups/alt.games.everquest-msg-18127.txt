I should have elaborated on this point a bit by pointing out that I have
NEVER done this... No Wizards I know have EVER done this.  And it has never
happened to anyone I know.

There was, however, a Druid that took a 3 newbies that I know IRL, and
ported them from Butcherblock to Misty Thicket after convincing them to
group with him... then he left them there.

newbie1's father: /tell asshole "What the hell do you think you're doing?!
Porting people like that, without telling them, and then abandoning them!"
quoth asshole: "What? I took them to a newbie zone."
/tell asshole: "They were *IN* a newbie zone!"
quoth asshole: "Fine I'll bring them back... for 75 plat."
(two of them were casters who did have gate, and gated themselves back, the
third was some melee class, so asshole was asking for 75 plat to rescue 1
character that he'd stranded himself).

True story.

I wasn't on, and newbie1's father didn't think to write it down, or I'd tell
you this druid's name, and what server this was on.

That is assuming I hadn't dropped asshole druid in CT for a little justice
already.
