You don't have to be a two-boxer to like using the /pause command, and
it does NOT mean that a cleric isn't paying attention.  I've done it
both ways, and with the pause instead of a count, you can use tenths
of a second to perfect when heals are cast, so it's just more precise,
and while still subject to human error, it is less so.  I'm happy
about the pause command, especially doing Fennin Ro or the nerfed
minis in Water and Fire.  I have to pay as much attention as ever, but
the tank is less likely to die due to another cleric's
crackheadedness.
