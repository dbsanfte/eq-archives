Qeynos information:

There are four NPCs that give the Writ quests (which show up as City Tasks 
in your quest journal):

1) In South Qeynos, the Pupil Wazzlepop (first npc on left as you enter the 
Mage's Tower);
2) In North Qeynos, the Guard Williamson at the foot of the steps to the 
citadel;
3) In North Qeynos, the Caretaker Nogfizzle by the tree just outside the 
entrance to the Temple of Life; and
4) In the Eldaar Grove, the Wanderer Greencoast, the guard standing at the 
tree elevator.

You don't have to take the first quest they offer. Refuse and try again 
until you have the one that you want. If your whole group chooses the quests 
named: Darkpaw Defilers (mystics), Darkpaw Encroachment (soldiers), Ripe for 
the Killing (youths), and Pestilence (shamans) then you will fight all 
gnolls that can be found grouped together (mystics and youths, soldiers and 
shamans) and breeze through the Status Points.
