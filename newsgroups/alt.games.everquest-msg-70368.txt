I will agree with that. Just got my wizard back up to lvl 21 again. The hard
thing about wizards is the resists. then ultimately the death that occurs
from it. A yellow or red mob.. better think again cause 9 times out of 10
the lil b%tc is gonna resist then agro on you like whte on rice. I solo'd up
to lvl 12 in Northern Ro. and believe me. Cutthroats hurt at level 12...
Thats when i started grouping. I love my wizard and had virtually no help at
all other than a friend telling my. Dont cast on Dorn B'Dynn till at least
lvl 20...
