why is it you don't have an actual response? you make yourself look
like an idiot by flinging meritless insults

are you sure the situation is that it's stupid that i think the
confines of a private agreement are not absolute?

because by your explanation, in the example above with the house
painting, the guy who made an agreement was bound to it forever, kind
of like magic, and not at all like the real world where people can
change their minds and deal with the consequences

which, in this case, means nothing
