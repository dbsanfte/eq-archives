I like the social interaction with a continuous pool of people who I've gotten
to know, and who have gotten to know me.  Its sort of like a club; we
aren't just people who happen to be in the same zone, but rather people who
to some small extent have chosen to be in permanent contact with each other.

Guilds provide a pool of people who can be called on to come do specific
quests, or just to come hunt; they also give you better odds of being asked
to go do those sorts of things with others, if you didn't have anything good
in mind.

They provide a base of people with some widespread knowledge of the
game, and some motivation not to screw with you without quickly noting
that they are joking.  Price checks and advice on how to spawn or
hunt a certain mob are often readily available and a good deal more
reliable than /ooc requests to the zone you happen to be in.

What don't I like?  Internal squabbling.  Fueds with other guilds. And
as someone else mentioned, being in a guild with few people in your
level range.  Very large guilds, you get a -lot- of squabbling, and the
percentage of people you find annoying may remain the same, but
the actual number of them increases, and they are all still on that one
channel.  Very small guilds, you might as well be guildless most of
the time, as there is noone on.  If you are the wrong level range,
or if the guild is moderate size but disparate in level, you won't find
many people to do things with even if a fair number are on.

Since people level at different rates, this leads to one of my least
favorite parts of guilds; outgrowing them.  If you level slowly,
the guild may leave you behind.  If you level rapidly, you will
naturally leave the guild behind.  Even if you are in the middle
of the pack, you'll see the faster players dropping out to join
higher level guilds, which limits the growth of the guild itself.
Its rare to see anyone who started out at relatively low level
in a guild and stuck with it up into the high end game... which
means eventually you are probably going to leave your guild,
or you are probably never going to hit the high 50s.
