There is a registry fix for it, this can be d/l so you don't have to do
anything other than click ok (it sets MouseHookDLLEnable to 0 under Software
Logitech etc)
Or, failing this working (and my MX500 never worked in EQ with this patch)
just go into taskmanager and end task in EM_EXEC.exe after this the extra
buttons won't work by the wheel will.
