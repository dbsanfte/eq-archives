Darkforge is actually cheaper to buy than Sentient, (Sentient is awesome
armour for Troll and Ogre SK due to the Int bonuses)

Runic Carver? Hardly the most difficult weapon to obtain(purchase wise),
last one I bought cost 90pp (normaly price on BB is now about 200) saying
that, did you inspect? That could of been a Blade of Xalgoz (same graphic,
as is Shieldstorm but that's War, Pal only)

Seen plently of sub ten warriors in full (visible) crafted carrying
Wormslayers (Why?) and when I my low twenties I saw a bunch of SK's all
human or erudite all wearing a mixture of DF and Flayed skin (altho I didn't
inspect so the BreastPlate's coulda been CG or EB) and all with Noctavigant
Blades (about 3 of these guys)
they were all green to me...now that's twinking
