Yep. And have sufficiently backed it up.

Doesn't matter if I'm the one talking about it as long as I saw it.
And we're laughing at you as the irony goes off the meter, now, given
you couldn't even find the reference in the first link to a ZEM.
Here's the quote, lamebrain.

(

Having said that if the group xp bounus scales all the way up on raids
...

Humm, 
Dungeon with ZEM of 20%+, 
group bonus for 36 man raid 140%, 
level 50+ mobs near your level +100%

XP per mob = 360% of "normal"
each player get 10% 
)

And you expect anyone to take you seriously when you can't find a
simple post? I apologize that the link didn't go directly to the
quote, it was actually the one in response to me by Jim Monk (and the
responses to him). When you search on google it defaults to giving
just one response per thread. I gave the link as to a thread, and not
a very big one. You didn't bother to check it out.

And you got burned, again. :-) Man it must suck to be you.

As I just pointed out, it's there. Your ability to find things is
rather laughable.

I'm not going to rehash year old arguments. Whether or not I was right
on what I was saying back then, the fact is it proves I was aware of
ZEM.

You lost! You asked for proof, and it was provided. Sorry if you can't
handle that.

The irony is delicious. Not only can't you handle it when someone
provides proof against you, you couldn't even see it when they did.

Please continue to post. Like I said before, I love when someone makes
a fool out of themselves for my benefit. :-)

Actually I made a typo. Should have read the existance or nonexistance
of a default zem. Once again, it is not necessary to know the formula
for gravity to know and accept someone is lighter on the moon.

I don't like being "corrected" by someone who doesn't understand what
I said and then lies about my position to defend himself. Think we've
forgotten that your original complaint was that you thought I was
bashing Ben Haddick because he spent a lot of time playing?

Nice weasel job though.

I'll take it that means you don't get it yet. I'll explain slowly and
carefully, maybe this time it will stick. You don't need to know the
formula to know in general terms what a ZEM is referring to. And I
have proven that, with links, which of course you couldn't follow, and
logic, which you had an even harder time following.

Of course it isn't. Why can't you understand that? What is it about
your education or intellect that makes you incapable of seeing past
the formula? The formula isn't the issue no matter how much you would
prefer it to be, because I said at the outset I didn't know the
precise math.

It's over. Give up. You are trying to twist the argument to attack a
strawman. I've been around way too long to fall victim to classic
defeatist strategy.

I don't give a shit. I'm an asshole, perfectly willing to accept it.
Now answer the question. Ready to concede you were wrong to assign a
poor belief to me, now that you've been hopelessly and utterly proven
wrong?

I think the two I provided are suffficient, given someone actually
reading them. 

Try again, James. You're what, oh for three or four now in this
thread, but maybe you'll get lucky!

Loser.

*waits to see if James has anything left*
