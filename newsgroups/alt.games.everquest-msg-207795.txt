So I'm in a group in OT with my 29 chanter.. and I'm feeling pretty 
bored and underutilized.  I'm definately low man in the group, the rest 
are 34-35.  I'm clearly there for clarity and haste.. and since the 
duration on both Clarity and Augmentation are decent, this means I'm 
sitting around doing not much otherwise.

I try dots... mobs are dying too fast for dots.  I mez overpulls... the 
group is sufficiently overkill that they aren't bothering with the 
niceties, mezzes are broken almost as fast as I bother to cast them.  
Slow... well at first I don't bother because mobs are dying too fast, 
but the cleric -is- having some trouble keeping up on heals and my mana 
is going to waste otherwise, so I start slowing all the larger mobs (the 
really small ones don't live long enough for the slow to land!)  Nukes?  
My evocation skill sucks, but what the heck, I mem my smallest nuke and 
use that on every mob, cycle time on it is long enough that I get one or 
perhaps two tries.  I do get the skill from 15 to 25, so thats 
something, better than practicing the skill for hours in POK anyway; the 
nukes aren't really doing anything, but I'm there doing my job otherwise 
and the nukes aren't hurting the group in any way I can think of.

Then the warrior who's been doing all the pulling has to leave.  We are 
at three beastlords, a cleric, a bard and me, at this point.  Bard 
volunteers to pull  but cleric complains that he's her mana supply... 
and I quickly volunteer instead and manage to get out there with a mob 
tailing me before someone figures out that I'm a skirtwearing chanter 
and not supposed to be out risking life and limb. 

What a flip, suddenly I'm having fun again -and- feeling useful.  I pull 
mobs with tash or slow, manuever them so its always single pulls (I 
-have- pulled this spot with other characters before often enough that 
this is second nature) , and manage to get hit on arrival  so as to 
engage my pet.  Job done, I sat on my can and medded back the mana I'd 
spent, replaced my Berserker Strength ( there to save the overworked 
cleric having to heal me quite so often), and watched for mob to get 
near death.  Out to find a new target, which I'd pull on getting the exp 
message from the last.

Even with the accelerated rate of pulling, the cleric wasn't having the 
mana problems because it was always one slowed mob the group was tearing 
up.  Yes, mez discipline would have accomplished the same thing... but 
I'm really not ready to start the tiresome life of a nagging chanter 
just yet  (heck, I've already lived that life to some extent running a 
bard up to 57).  And single pulls beats mezed mobs in camp anyway, since 
there's no mana cost to them, and no risk of resists or funny aggro on 
the break.
