I've actually just been working on this.  I was Amiable to Coldain and was
still threatening to CoV after killing giants in EW and GD.  I went to the
KD / WL zone and killed giants and faction farmed for two days until I was
dubious to CoV.

From what I understand (may be wrong, though), the frost giants, which the
EW side mostly is, give multiple hits to Coldain, while the storm giants
(some on WL side, but mostly at bank and arena) give multiple hits to CoV.

A friend of mine took the quick way.  He had just reached threatening with
CoV and he tagged along with his guild on a Vindi kill.  He did the faction
farm thing on him with a throwing knife, and was immediately dubious to the
dragons.  Apparently there's some HUGE faction hits on the bigger mobs
there.
