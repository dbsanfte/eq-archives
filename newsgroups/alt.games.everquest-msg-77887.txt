Sigh .. that's the bad thing about online communication .. you can't see me
rolling my eyes in a sarcastic look while saying "What fucking ever!" I know
how his little scam works ... just didn't see the need to reiterate the
fact!

And I also reported his butt to ATTBI! Now he's trying to whine his way out
of his little scam! Boy his daddy is going to be mad when he can't download
his porn because junior got his account shut down! =)

Hee hee.
