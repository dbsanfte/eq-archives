There've been weapons better than epics since before Shadows of
Luclin, I beleive. Epics are still good for the point where you
acquire them, and they are admirable status symbols in most cases.
(Some more so than others. BST and Rogue epics are fairly trivial, SK
and Magician are major pains)

That said, some epics are useful through "end game", mostly the pure
caster ones, though. Magician is a very notable example, mainly for
the pet it summons.

I'm not the best source for comment on most of the class's epics,
though. I can tell you that most BSTs do continue to use their offhand
epic claw even as high as level 65 for the worn haste.
