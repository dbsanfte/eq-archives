Good. Why do you need to spend real life cash to accomplish something in a
game?

Im sure I wouldn't be the only person to do that.

Lets see, who makes more money for verant though...  Hardcore players who
have been there 3 years and will play till the end, usually having multiple
accounts, or people who play for a short while, demand a level 60, then move
on when the next game catches their eye.

Why should that bother you?   You've already said you don't care about the
rules..

Again you've already said that doesn't bother you though.. look - "The same
way I don't care whether someone buys an account off e-bay"

Its shitheads I dislike too.. and whilst they aren't selling pre-made level
60 characters, I don't have to worry about bumping into too many of them

Damn, im really hurt now.

> Its against the rules. Can you see a pattern here?

But you don't care about rules remember.. see, look - "The same way I don't
care whether someone buys an account off e-bay"

Sure come say hi.   Better wait till they start selling SSRA, ST and VT keys
though.

You might want to wait till they offer a tour guide service too though (for
another small fee of course).. I wouldnt expect somebody who had to buy
their character to know how to find such places, let alone move around
safely inside.
