Lacking in Long pig?
You still working as a chef Biz? I am so glad I am never likely to eat at
your restaurant.
Anyway, I thought we were meant to taste like pork.

I have tried Kangeroo which doesn't taste a hole lot different to beef, imo.
Although I'd certainly not suggest that I ever had a refined palate...far
too many Brit Curries ruined my sense of taste long ago.
