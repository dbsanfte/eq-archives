A) Only one warrior needs any AC at all, as others note.

B) 120 AC will make no difference at all to a well
equipped high end warrior, since the "soft cap" on
AC currently in place, they could lose 300 AC or
more and still take very close to the same level
of damage.

C) 120 minute recycle on a 30 second ability that only puts
warrior damage up to the general level of what a rogue does
all the time?  How about you just give them a 1000 damage
nuke they can only cast every 2 hours RT?
