Dear Not Winning,

I can relate. My bf played 'that stupid game' (What I called it when I
didn't know any better.) 3 to 4 nights a week and a good part of one day of
the weekend. I didn't mind that he would play, or that he wasn't doing more
fufilling things.. Mine is a much more serious complaint. HE WAS HOGGING ALL
OUR BANDWIDTH.

He suggested I try the game. I was reluctant at first, since being an
ex-Ult*ma Onl*ne player, I knew that these games can be addictive and I knew
that I didn't really have as much time as I'd like to invest in a player.
Since we invested in a router (We were using his computer as a proxy
before), I finally tried it since we could share a connection (Yeah... we
could before but not without problems.) and I have been playing it ever
since. (Solusek Ro: Troll Warrior Oogoka, Half-Elf Bard Asiren and Half-Elf
Erasia).

 (Another little note: We are both playing at the same time using a 33.6
modem (Something is wrong with the 56k) . We notice brief lag only when one
of us is zoning.)

You both should examine why she feels a need to escape. It could be an
excuse just to get you off her back, then again, maybe not since your
attitude seems to be that she should be serving you (With housework and sex)
instead of playing 'that stupid game.'

And what Ann Landers said.
