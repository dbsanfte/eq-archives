The Grey, as it first came out, was *the* ultimate kiting place.  The mobs
all had low magic resistance and the whole zone was wide open and easy to
get around in.

This led to AE groups going there and, basically, pulling the entire zone to
the AE group for easy, massive XP.  This also had the effect of making it so
that only a couple of groups could dominate the zone and prevent anyone else
from getting any kind of mobs.

To counter this tactic, Verant added "Shimmering Rockfiends".  These guys
are *highly* magic resistant.  Hard to stun 'em, nuke 'em, snare 'em, etc.
That brought an end to the AE groups rather quickly.

It is still possible to kite.  There are certain areas - like the area
around the temple, for instance - that the Shimmering Rockfiends will not
wander into.  So *if* you can get a few mobs and *not* get a Shimmering
Rockfiend in the meantime, you can kite fairly easily.

The new problem is that the "safe areas" - like the temple - are densely
populated with player characters doing static camps of the temple mobs.  So
it's a hassle trying to stay out of everyone's way while not getting killed.

If you can learn the zone and what kiting patterns to follow, the Grey is
terrific XP for 51.  Don't forget EB.
