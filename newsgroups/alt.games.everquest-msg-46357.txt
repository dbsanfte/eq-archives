Hide/Sneak never wears off.  I've stood hidden/sneaking (we need a word for
this!) in the midst of 'red' camps and gone AFK for extended periods of
time - unless they throw a solid nerf it will never drop unless a mob's AE
spell hits you.
As other poster says, it does drop when zoning and, obviously, attacking.

You didn't need to pick a Halfling for the H-S combo.  ALL races of thieves
get it; and rogues are the only class (regardless of race) which gets a
success/fail message on Hide or Sneak.

Stop by the Safehouse sometime *soon* and visit the Library in the forums.
Many basic questions will be answered there for you.
