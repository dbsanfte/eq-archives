I rave about this zone every chance I get.  It really pulled my butt out of
the fire when I was about to quit Everquest.  Had dinged 25 pretty quickly
in the Karanas, but things were really slowing down.  Dinging 26 was a real
struggle because at that point the one blue mob that was plentiful in raw
numbers were crag spiders and it was difficult to find many that hadn't just
been killed by a level 50+ toon looking for silks (aviaks were always camped
and xps were pretty lame in a group, scythe beetles and griffeenes were a
bit hard to come by, and most centaurs were either light blue or yellow).  I
wandered from zone to zone dying, then found Marus Seru.  I hung out by the
Neth. Lair entrance, started with Rockhoppers and moved up to Stonegrabbers,
Zelniaks, and Lightcrawlers. The xp bar moves nicely with each kill. I don't
know how many times I was able to get out of trouble by running to the zone
with a train of Stonebraggers or a Rhino Beetle on my heels.   Sometimes I
used to just love to sit in the round building and pick off the straggler in
someone else's train.  When I got MSII and could summon a pet Zelniak or
Lightcrawler, man was I living.
