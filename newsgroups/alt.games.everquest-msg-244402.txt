Yes, that's exactly what it is, a nebulous concept.  It's never been said 
that stats would be 1:1 comparable across classes.  Each class has 
mitigation abilities on top of their AC, as I understand it, and each 
class's AC is on a completely different scale.  At one point, bck in beta, 
probably, AC may have been intended to mean something direct about armor 
class.  Now it's just a number that generally goes up as your defensive 
abilities go up.  And as complicated as EQ has become, that doesn't much 
suprise me.
