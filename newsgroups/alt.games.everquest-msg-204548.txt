A classic demonstration of this is watching mages charm in BoT.
Unlike 'chanters with there stuns to help regain control, mages
have nothing.  Add to that they are learning with a 500+ hitter
pet, and things get nasty.

One day I was watching a mage charming in the next group over,
he had a snarer - but the pet finally got him, then turned around
and ate his group, then 2 folks from my group (including me).

The thing was obviously mage hasted, he was equipped with muzzle,
girdle and swords (we know this because we killed it and they were
on it).  When it attacked me I lost 3k hp in ~2 seconds.

My group got it debuffed, and we killed it (it ate our shaman, but
the wiz got it rooted, we rezzed in - quick rod for the shammy, slow
and take it down.)  Interesting thing - BOV has 85% haste in slot 4,
shaman/chanter slows are in slot 2, so they don't overwrite BOV.  
Ravaging Venom from scorps in PoS has a 15% slow in slot 4 and gets
rid of BOV though.  I think that BOV must have worn off on it before
we re-engaged, the mana drain wasn't high enough otherwise.

At any rate, a 96% hasted, dual-wielding, 500+ hitting pet is an
awesome force, but it is like lightning in a bottle, barely restrained
and ready to annihilate you if you slip.
