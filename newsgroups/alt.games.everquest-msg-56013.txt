For me now at lvl 26 in GD fighting Yaka Razorhoof 
my spell list could look like

--empty--
--empty--
--empty--
--empty--
--empty--
--empty--
--empty--
--empty--

Nothing could hit him arghhh died a nasty death on that one :)

At lvl 12 i think i had the following setup

lesser shielding
lifedraw
engulfing darkness
heat blood
leach
grim aura
poison bolt
dark empathy

But this could change depending on what i was fighting.
