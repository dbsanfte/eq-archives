Would it kill you to first politely ask THEN jump on someone's sh!t?
Hmmmm? is *everybody* on this list striking for @ssholedom besides a few
nice ones like Annie? As far as I am concerned, a flamefest on someone 
*is* the same as jumping up and down screaming like a 2 year old. I dont 
let the kids I come into contact with blackmail me into changing 
something. If they talk to me in a rational manner, then I will discuss 
things with them. I have been known to negotiate a change in my course 
of action with my kids on more than one occasion. I get compliments from 
other parents in the grocery store when my younges goddaughter will 
wander up to me clutching a box of cookies and attemt to negotiate them 
in exchange for the box of Kix her mother has on the shpping list and 
taking no for an answer instead of pitching a fit. i would expect an 
adult to be able to exhibit the same politeness in 'policing' a 
newsgroup that you supposedly love and treat as a community as a 5 year 
old girl.

So, think of me as a consciencious objector to @ssholes flaming me when 
a simple 'would you mind changing to top posting as we prefer it that 
way' would have worked instantly [unless i was posting from a different 
computer and didnt notice the settings for some reason or a nother=)]

Now this is a nice civil conversation. If you were to ask me politely 
inthe same manner of this discussion to change, I would. simple as that. 
Unlike several of the serious flameholes on the group, I have no 
particular vested interest in rude behavior. If you notice, my normal 
general posts not in a thread such as this are helpful such as the 
recent thread on finding corpses.
