Want to?  No.  But I have yet to discover a method for ensuring
that absolutely no one on the raid is fully competent.

My server doesn't have guilds big enough for Vox raids to
be "by invitation only", nor a reservation system, so all
raids are either pick-up, or consist of a core of guildies/friends
with empty raid slots being filled by a "friend of a friend"
of unknown ability.

In any case, even on scheduled guild-only raids, someone
always unexpectedly turns out to be the weakest link.

"Follow me" works reasonably well only for the initial
rush.  And even then, lag (and there's a *lot* of lag
in crowded dragon raids) can cause someone who turned
right to look for a while as if they were still running
straight, causing you to "follow them" into a pit that
they had sidestepped.

A coin path, on the other hand, is static and not subject
to lag.

Furthermore, in raids using the "bind rush" technique,
those who respawn after they get eaten by the dragon have
to run back to the dragon's lair solo, and can't follow
anyone.

It's a bad thing.  Many raids succeed or fail on the loss of
one or two participants.

Plus, people running screaming around in the pits often
unintentionally train the raid at an awkward time, and that's
a bad thing too.

I don't understand why *anyone* would go on a raid without
a map of the zone at hand, and I'd like to /bonk the people
who don't, but experience teaches me that I might as well
just face reality and understand that some people are
going to fall into the pits anyway unless some method is
used to minimize that risk.

A wise leader will take steps to ensure that even the
weakest raid members end up being as effective as possible,
even if that means protecting them from their own
stupidity, slow modems, or lack of preparedness.
