If you zone fast take the KC shortcut. Port to SF, run to BW, egress
to the other side, zone to DL right near KC. It's a lot faster than
running through DL (assuming your zone times are reasonable).

She's fairly slow, so assuming you don't walk out of the tunnel and
step on her tail (ahem) you should be able to outrun her.
