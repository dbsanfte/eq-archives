Let me preface this by saying that I've been out of the retail
game for a few years, and so a lot of my information on what
is top of the line for what price is a bit outdate.
But, saying that, yes, I think you did a decent job getting an
EQ machine.

Everything on your list seems more than good enough except for
your processor speed and video card.  That being said, the video
card seems to be the biggest weak link.  I have a MX 420 card in
a PIII-600 w/ 512 memory and with mostly low models and low rez
graphics the thing runs like a champ.  But if you want a lot of high end
models I'd look to a new video card.  (High end ATI or GEForce)
But, all in all, you might want to see how you like the performance
before dropping $150-$300 on a new vid card.
