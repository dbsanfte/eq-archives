Aye, maybe. But then again, if you walk up to me and start digging through
my pockets, I'm gonna clock you. Simply looking at someone is not analgous
to an EQ inspection.

I don't get upset, but I do have a nice bio: (My two main chars are a
druid and a chanter)

"If you asked before you inspected, THANKS!"
If not, no (crack/sow) for you. Don't even ask, it's already too late."
