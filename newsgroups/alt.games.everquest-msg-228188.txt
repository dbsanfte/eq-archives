There are all sorts of loot bitches that occur on messageboards, only one
type of which is related to NBG issues.  DKP whines are another.  Someone
getting screwed in an officer discretion guild is another.   I'm an equal
opportunity hater of all of them, because in the end all it boils down to is
a vehement argument over some junk in a computer game.  If you feel that
compromises my integrity on this issue, so be it.

The person I was responding to noted that the people who support random
rolling on everything valuable that drops were generally more fanatical than
those people who support NBG.   In my experience, that's not beem the case,
and I was mentioning my experience since it seems to be the opposite of what
the person was suggesting.   (It's all right there so you can go back and
read it again for context!)

If "loot bitches" refers only to complaint threads stemming from NBG issues,
with the complaintant being a supporter of NBG, my sentence wouldn't have
made any sense, and the subject of it would have been a redundancy.  Perhaps
you should try harder with your comprehension.

That's nice.  Who are those people, who put them in charge and why should I
be paying attention to them?

It works when it works I guess.  You do realize that's not a very compelling
statement, right?
