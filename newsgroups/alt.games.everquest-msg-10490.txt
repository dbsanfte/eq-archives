Uhmm I bought BOTH the 'official' guides... doh!

Okay, yeah... the first one WAS useless (at best... at worst it was just
plain WRONG)...

but I found the Prima guide was actually quite useful... the spell lists and
skills lists are pretty good for a new player, and the intro to basic
tactics was VERY handy to get started with.

I'll agree that it's not worth buying the books if you've already been
playing for a year or so, but you might find it a good reference to use
in-game... something you can pick up and read quickly rather than have to
camp and go find it on a web-site :o)
