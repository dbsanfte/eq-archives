After my last post, I tried Google.  First hit is on Allakazam's, and has
the info.  Use it to combine one water purification tablet (bought from
vendor) with a foraged water reed (some say other things work, too), to give
3 flasks of purified water.  Someone said they thought purified water lasted
longer than regular water, but the date on their comment was from before the
patch that introduced variable food/water effectiveness, so I think they
were imagining it.

The tablets are lore (or were when the comments at Allakazam's were written,
at least), which would make this thing pretty useless.  Not that it would be
particularly useful if they were not lore.  I can't think of any situation
where one would want this thing, unless there is some quest that needs
purified water.
