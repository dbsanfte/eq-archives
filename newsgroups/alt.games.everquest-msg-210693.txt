Whats this class warfare crap?
I have played the game for going on 3 years and amassed and spent a
good deal of plat. I look at the "new" PoP and LoY weapons as very
close to Epic quality for less than 25k heck most under 15k. That is
an amount one could swing only a few months into the game if they were
smarter than a rock. And the great thing is it can be resold when you
get something better not retired to the bank for CR duty. Face it SoE
blew it on epics and never had the guts to admit it and fix them.
