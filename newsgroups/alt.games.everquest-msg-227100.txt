Part of this is the high death penalty, I think.  In level-based games like
EQ, people tend to measure their progress by the movement of the XP bar, and
if you die and lose a couple hours worth of XP, it is very very annoying.
This makes many people play conservatively.

I've played two MMORPGs now to reasonably high level (EQ to 61, DAoC to 50),
and even though DAoC has a much smaller XP loss on death than EQ (unless you
get a res in EQ, then DAoC's XP loss is bigger), I still try hard to avoid
dying there--it's very annoying to be back at my bind point, rather than
killing things.  Taking into account the XP not gained because of all the
travel time a death adds, if I die two or three times in a session, I'll
finish that session significantly behind in XP compared to where I would
have been had I not died, however, unless I've really screwed things up, I
will NOT be behind where I *started* that session.  That works out very
well...I respect death in DAoC and try to avoid it, but not so much that I
won't avoid something that looks like fun just because I think there is a
good chance I won't survive.

There may be other factors that require EQ to have a larger death penalty,
though.  For example, many classes can bind close to the fight, and so
travelling back after death is not a major detriment to them.  Maybe if the
death penalty were too low, there would not be enough incentive for those
classes to avoid death?

> LDoN fixed that by removing repops and removing the "other players".

I'd like to see a game try not having repops anywhere that people are
present.  If you kill a camp of Orcs, and then stay there, they should not
repop, at least right at the camp.  If they are gonna repop, it should be
over a hill or some other place out of sight, and then they should come back
to the camp.

For dungeons, the way it could work is mobs don't repop, and when the
dungeon mob population gets low, the entrance to the dungeon closes, so no
more players can get in.  When the players inside finally leave, the dungeon
could repop, and the entrance open again.

My guild did Chardok that way.  It was indeed a lot of fun.  We also did the
Hole once that way...although it wasn't really a crawl.  More of a riot--we
just basically ran through as a gang, beating up anything we found.  It too
was a lot of fun.
