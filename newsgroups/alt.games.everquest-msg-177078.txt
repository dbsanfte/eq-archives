There is a false wall somewhere in the cell that leads to a room with 3/4
doors in it.
Each of these doors has a fairly nasty caster behind it.
When you get to this room find the false wall on the right, this leads to a
stairs leading up.
Go up the stairs, running past any mobs you meet until you reach the top.
At the top turn right...this will lead you to a bridge across to a tower.
Jump off the left hand side of the bridge, you will drop down onto the ramp
at the zone.
Remeber to call train before you do this though.
